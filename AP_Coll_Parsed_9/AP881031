a political consulting firm led by two top 
officials in george bushs presidential campaign has offered to 
represent the government of haiti citing the firms ability to 
work in the transitional environment in washington the orlando 
sentinel reported tuesday 
given the fragile environment in haiti and the ensuing 
presidential election in the united states there exists a window of 
opportunity for us to combine our resources and energies for the 
mutual benefit of our two countries stated the letter from bush 
amp co 
the letter dated oct 12 also expressed hope that avril would 
retain our services 
the washington firm is run by gop campaign officials frederick 
m bush who is unrelated to the vice president and margaret 
alexander 
the letter to haitian president prosper avril appeared to be 
signed by frederick bush but he told the newspaper monday that his 
name had been signed by an associate without his permission or his 
knowledge 
this upsets me very much he said this was totaly 
unauthorized i want nothing to do with the government of haiti 
the switchboard operator at bushs headquarters in washington 
said no one was available late monday for comment 
bush 39 is deputy finance chairman of the vice presidents 
election campaign he was a white house staffer and the vice 
presidents deputy chief of staff during president reagans first

but he said he wanted no part of any subsequent discussions 
i specifically said that i would not be involved he said 
bush said that he has not been active in the company for the 
past two years because of his fundraising duties for the vice

fourteen public utilities across washington state 
voted monday to approve a 226 million settlement letting them out 
of the giant washington public power supply system securities fraud 
trial in tucson ariz 
its a settlement we can certainly live with and handle and 
it wont have great diverse impact on our state said tacoma 
attorney albert malanca who engineered the complex agreement 
involving utilities the state of washington and the federal 
bonneville power administration 
while several utilities agreeing to the settlement on monday 
said rate increases may be necessary they added that those 
increases would be small and the economic damage to the northwest 
region minimal 
under terms of the agreement the 14 utilities would pay 181 
million bpa and the federal government would pay 35 million and 
the state would pay 10 million to plaintiffs who sued after wppss 
defaulted in 1983 on 225 billion in bonds used to build two 
nuclear power plants the plaintiffs include more than 24000 past 
and present bondholders 
the plants were begun but never finished after regional energy 
planners determined power from the plants wouldnt be needed the 
regions economy suffered when wppss attempted to build five 
multibillion dollar nuclear power plants and finished only one 
in olympia gov booth gardner announced the state would pay 10 
million toward the settlement if the legislature concurs 
washington state faces a separate lawsuit involving the same 
plaintiffs 
bpa participation still requires the approval of the us 
department of justice which is expected this week and final 
approval will have to come from us district judge william 
browning who is overseeing the trial in tucson 
the pact leaves snohomish county public utility district the 
only utility remaining as a defendant in the trial although it has 
an option to settle until nov 10 snohomish contracted for the 
biggest single share 13 percent on the two terminated wppss 
plants 
the trial over the largest municipal bond default in history 
was recessed last week in tucson when attorneys reported a 
settlement was possible it was scheduled to resume wednesday 
besides snohomish other defendants remaining include two 
engineering firms and a financial adviser firm 
the price for snohomish if it takes up the nov 10 option would 
be 487 million that would be in line with the 37 million 
perpercentagepoint of interest in the two abandoned nuclear 
plants other defendant utilities agreed to pay 
tacoma director of utilities ted coates said the settlement 
would bring to 591 million the amount paid to the class of 
plaintiffs in the giant federal lawsuit 
settlements during the past year have removed most defendants 
and totaled 365 million in cash in addition to the 591 million 
would be 96 million in contested insurance claims 
coates estimated the settlement would add 3 to 4 percent to 
tacoma city lights expenses he said the city planned to pay the 
bill through floating longterm bonds 
under terms of the agreements most utilities would have to make 
initial payments dec 15 with final payments dec 15 1989 
interest would be paid according to the agreement 
the settlement memorandum noted some utilities could recover 
substantial amounts through insurance carriers that have so far 
refused to pay the insurance coverage contracted for

a prosecutor filed an 800 million 
defamation lawsuit monday against tawana brawley the black 
teenager who a grand jury said concocted a story of abduction and 
rape by six white men 
dutchess county prosecutor steven pagones lawsuit also named as 
defendants the rev al sharpton and lawyers c vernon mason and 
alton maddox advisers to miss brawley who had claimed that pagones 
was involved in the purported attack last november 
a grand jury cleared pagones of any involvement in the case that 
began when miss brawley then 16 was found in wappingers falls 
smeared with dog feces and with racial slurs written on her body 
miss brawley never cooperated with the grand jury and her 
advisers dismissed the resulting report as the product of a racist 
system 
i hope he goes through with it sharpton said in response to 
the lawsuit monday 
well i think that mr pagones has the potential of making 
history in being the first man to sue himself into jail he said 
sharpton said miss brawley would tell her story in court and 
along with other witnesses would prove pagones involvement 
he will be proven guilty of rape and sodomy and will go to 
jail sharpton said 
mason had no comment on the lawsuit according to a receptionist 
at his law office maddox did not immediately return telephone 
calls for comment 
pagones lawyer gerald hayes also did not return telephone 
calls 
pagones had said at a news conference on oct 10 that he 
intended to file suit

the southern city of basra devastated by 
the 8yearold iraniraq war now has been invaded by swarms of 
desert locusts the ministry of irrigation and agriculture says 
a report on staterun television monday said six separate clouds 
of the cropdevouring insects were in the city but that the 
ministry was using helicopters to bring the situation under control 
no further details were immediately available locusts can eat 
twice their body weight every day so the swarms are sprayed with 
insecticides to keep them from reaching agricultural areas 
locusts from sudan and ethiopia have swept across the arabian 
peninsula in the past two weeks 
the un food and agriculture organization said in a recent 
report that the spread of locusts represents a lateral extension 
of the plague which will make control efforts much more 
difficult

whatever sense it may make on solely 
economic grounds the decision to shut the lenin shipyard is a slap 
at the solidarity trade union movement at a time the government 
ostensibly is seeking dialogue 
the closing poses a difficult challenge for union leader lech 
walesa who has been preaching economic reform but undoubtedly did 
not want it to begin by eliminating his workplace and political 
base 
mondays announcement follows closely a government demand that 
walesa remove two longtime solidarity advisers from his delegation 
to promised roundtable talks with authorities which were to 
start in midoctober 
walesa refused and the talks now appear in jeopardy 
the developments underscore an end to the accommodative mood on 
both sides that briefly seemed to dominate polish politics after 
walesa ended a series of strikes in early september in exchange for 
the promise of the talks on solidaritys future 
the government has taken a more energetic decisive tone since 
the ascension to prime minister last month of mieczyslaw f 
rakowski the party propaganda chief and a longtime solidarity foe 
rakowski has said the situation is too urgent to wait for talks 
with the opposition before trying to revitalize the economy 
but the opposition which has long distrusted rakowski 
questions whether he is interested in talks at all 
rakowski said in a broadcast interview monday that the decision 
to close the gdansk shipyard dec 1 and liquidate it over the next 
year was purely economic and had nothing to do with solidarity 
the official media gave heavy coverage to the decision but made 
no mention of the shipyards symbolic importance as the birthplace 
and stronghold of the only independent labor movement allowed in 
the soviet bloc 
the official news agency pap said the stateowned shipyard 
polands largest has been losing money and increasingly draining 
the public treasury 
but walesa said it was no coincidence that the shipyard was the 
first industrial enterprise in the country to fall victim to the 
budget ax 
premier rakowskis decision was not dictated by economic 
reasons he said calling the move rakowskis personal 
provocation against the yard where solidarity sprang to life in 
august 1980 after a nationwide strike wave 
while vowing to fight the closing walesa said he agreed the 
economy needs restructuring and basic changes solidarity is and 
has been for those changes 
but he said the yard could be saved by dismissing incompetent 
managers and allowing workers to run it more efficiently themselves 
historian bronislaw geremek a close walesa adviser said 
solidarity always was prepared to accept painful economic choices 
in the course of reform but those steps were supposed to be a 
subject for agreement in the nowdelayed talks with authorities he 
said 
by deciding unilaterally to close the shipyard rakowski 
either buried the chances for the round table or considered the 
round table already buried geremek said if such decisions are 
taken without first achieving a social contract then what one 
wants to prove is that there is no need for such a way no need for 
dialogue 
one western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity called 
the governments move a political masterstroke 
if solidarity strikes it will lend credence to rakowskis 
argument that the union is unreasonable and poses an obstacle to 
efforts to reform polands inefficient debtridden economy 
and by shutting down the shipyard the strikers would only be 
hastening what the government wants to do next month anyway 
but if solidarity does not mount a protest to defend its home 
base walesa and the solidarity leadership run the risk of seeming 
toothless to militant followers at home and wouldbe supporters 
abroad 
polands first major plant closing is likely to send shock waves 
through factories nationwide but because the closing was announced 
during a fourday holiday weekend it was difficult to immediately 
judge the degree of public sympathy for the workers 
the government meanwhile was trying to take the sting out of 
the closure for the approximately 10000 workers facing layoffs it 
said state enterprises have far more than enough jobs going begging 
in gdansk province at equal or higher pay and it promised free job 
retraining for those who need it 
ironically and perhaps not accidentally rakowski made the move 
only days before prime minister margaret thatcher of britain is due 
to arrive for a visit that is to include a trip to gdansk to see 
walesa on friday 
official commentators have been drawing parallels between 
rakowskis plans to overhaul polands economy and the toughness 
shown by mrs thatcher in facing down the unions and cutting back 
moneylosing state industry in britain

antipersonnel mines designed to maim 
an enemy remain scattered about afghanistan and must be cleared 
before more than 5 million refugees in pakistan and iran can return 
home united nations officials say 
the mines are estimated to range in number from hundreds of 
thousands to 5 million some look like toys and are small enough to 
fit in the palm of a persons hand if picked up they can blow 
away a hand if stepped on a victim can lose a foot 
zia rizvi spokesman for the un economic and humanitarian 
program for afghan refugees said the landmines have to be found 
and defused before a billiondollar rebuilding program can begin 
the devices are believed to have been laid by soviet and afghan 
government forces during their nineyear war against moslem 
insurgents the insurgents also have laid a number of antitank 
devices 
teams of mineclearing experts from the united states britain 
france and turkey have been in pakistan to plan a training program 
designed to show afghans how to locate identify and defuse the 
mines 
a 9million training program is scheduled to begin shortly 
rizvi said 
clearing the mines is a prerequisite to any rebuilding 
activity said rizvi 
the soviets are not a contributor to the mineclearing effort 
but they have assured us of their total cooperation said rizvi 
since the april signing of an accord providing for the 
withdrawal of more than 100000 soviet troops from afghanistan the 
united nations has begun mobilizing for one of the largest refugee 
movements in its history 
rizvi said the widespread use of the landmines is a comment on 
the people who make sell buy and use them 
the usbacked moslem guerrillas known as the mujahedeen have 
been fighting the afghanistans marxist government since it seized 
power in 1978 the soviet union entered the conflict in december 
1979 
fifteen different types of antipersonnel mines have been 
identified along with five models of antitank mines rizvi said 
in addition to the antipersonnel devices that resemble toys are 
are scattered around villages another common type is a bright 
green plastic device that looks like a butterfly and fits into the 
palm of a hand 
rizvi said unexploded ordnance of other kinds such as dud 
bombs also are scattered around the afghan countryside 
the first task of foreign minedetecting experts will be to make 
afghans aware of what to look for rizvi said children will be 
educated to the dangers as well 
foreign experts will train afghans who in turn will pass on 
their knowledge to others he said 
eventually said rizvi an afghan mineclearing team would be 
established in most villages or cluster of villages

the taylor highway a ribjarring gravel 
washboard that snakes through mining hills northeast of this 
interior alaska village doesnt rate much mention in the tourist 
brochures 
but the taylor is larry champagnes specialty he drives a tow 
truck and as they say in the trade business is picking up he sat 
the other day in his chevron station and pointed out the highways 
latest victim a van with a crushed roof and shattered windows 
he was passing a motor home on a curve got over too far and 
thppt into the river he said champagne was happy to haul 
the van and its uninjured driver back to tok for 700 
a 1984 legislative study found that 60 percent of alaska 
highways were in fair to poor condition but the potholes and frost 
heaves dont slow the flow of vacationers growing herds of 
tourists not only keep champagne smiling but also help fuel debate 
over this frontier states transportation future 
more roads say business leaders who see a young and developing 
state with little access to remote villages and mineral deposits 
stop the bulldozers cry environmentalists who see a pristine 
land needing protection from the forces that paved over the lower 
48 states 
the arguments likely will continue as long as there are places 
people cannot drive to and much of alaska fits that category the 
states 11600 miles of roads are concentrated in the southeastern 
quarter leaving vast areas untracked 
onefourth of alaskas halfmillion residents live unconnected 
by road to the outside world of 151 incorporated communities 133 
are unconnected including the state capital of juneau 
given the mountains and permanently frozen ground that cover 
much of alaska its a wonder roads were ever built 
turnofthecentury gold rushes spurred the first major 
construction in world war ii concerns about a japanese invasion 
prompted another building frenzy the 1520mile alaska highway 
alaskas first overland link to the lower 48 was finished in just 
nine months 
since statehood in 1959 expansion has continued steadily the 
latest road completed this summer in northwestern alaska is a 
54mile link from the coast to a mineral deposit known as red dog 
i try not to think about that said susan alexander state 
representative for the wilderness society which unsuccessfully 
fought the roads route through cape krusenstern national monument 
she said wilderness is easily destroyed by roads and resulting 
development and pollution she cited the 416mile dalton highway 
built in 1974 to link fairbanks and the prudhoe bay oil fields 
although only the highways southern half is open to the public 
lax enforcement lets many drivers slip through to the north and 
alexander worries about the effect on wildlife 
increased access means increased poaching and there 
definitely has been poaching along the road the road lets in 
people hunters who wouldnt have been there otherwise she said 
letting more people into alaska is what economic boosters have 
had in mind for years wherever roads have gone tourism has 
followed us customs officials say 38150 vehicles about 70 
percent of them motor homes and campers entered the state on the 
alaska highway last year 
roads can cut shipping costs to villages and make remote mining 
more competitive say the boosters who over the years have 
proposed dozens of roads to fill blank spaces on the map 
in 1977 travel guides called the 152mile elliott highway near 
fairbanks the road to nome even though it deadended and 
still does 500 miles short of the bering sea town 
in 1986 the greater fairbanks chamber of commerce suggested a 
road that would head 200 miles southwest from denali national park 
to mcgrath then swing north another 200 miles to the yukon river 
in southeastern alaska plans surface occasionally to connect 
juneau to highways that now stop in haines and skagway 
but such projects each estimated to cost hundreds of millions 
of dollars are distant dreams for state officials who can barely 
raise the 52 million needed each year to maintain existing roads 
alaskas oildependent government has grown cautious since the 
oil boom busted and the state department of transportation plans 
no major highway expansion it would cost 600 million just to 
bring alaskas rural highways up to standards said ron lind the 
agencys planning and budget director 
patterns of land use and ownership also discourage 
roadbuilding national parks preserves and monuments now cover 50 
million of alaskas 375 million acres natives protective of open 
space needed for subsistence hunting and fishing own 44 million 
acres 
but things could change quickly in alaskas boombust economy 
as publisher robert henning wrote in an alaska geographic book 
called adventure roads north 
strong antiroads sentiments of environmentalist groups have 
slowed alaskan road construction but in the history of the north 
there has ever been the cry for more roads more trails and it 
is inevitable that the road building will continue like it or 
not it seems to be the american way 
wherever and whenever roads are built the likes of larry 
champagne will be there to pick up the pieces back at the chevron 
station champagne was smiling again a winnebago driver was in for 
the second time that day with a flat tire 
champagne quickly fixed the tire and proceeded to the cash 
register thatll be 10 he said you have a nice day

the city of light sits on a subterranean city of 
darkness a vast network of stone quarries that has given refuge to 
scoundrels saints and the bones of 6 million souls it is where 
the phantom of the opera set up house here is a report by an ap 
correspondent who visited the catacombs 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the phantom was laid to rest long ago in the 
cellars of the opera but figures nearly as macabre still haunt the 
catacombs that wind through the belly of paris like entrails and 
conceal millions of human bones 
each weekend dozens of people slip out of their city skins and 
into the maze on which the city rests they descend as far as 90 
feet into a world where night is eternal the unexpected waits at 
each turn and the game is to the fearless 
some are history buffs seeking the dank breath of ancient paris 
others are adventurers and still others inhabit a marginal world 
whether above ground or below 
they are called cataphiles and are drawn as if by 
enchantment to the darkness beneath the city of light they tread 
in the footsteps of sorcerers bandits smugglers the quick and 
the sly who haunted the tunnels centuries ago 
many who spend time below use nicknames destroy 
calamity or professor sato and dress in exaggerated punk 
or skinhead style 
the eternal eerie silence and stillness enclose a voyager who 
weaves through the sandcolored maze of galleries rooms nooks and 
niches as if pulled along by the flashlight beam 
fossils of ancient creatures are imbedded in walls nicked by the 
pickaxes of workers long dead minuscule stalactites have formed on 
the dripping ceilings of what once were quarries for the limestone 
that built paris most of them worked in the middle ages 
during world war ii the catacombs were bunkers for the german 
occupiers and hideouts for the french resistance they have been a 
blessing to mushroom growers who harvested tons of champignons de 
paris each day from the murky gardens 
its a milieu that is such an anachronism compared with the 
rest of the capital said inspector jeanclaude saratte director 
of police operations in the catacombs 
it has been against the law to go underground since 1955 because 
of risks both to travelers and the citys foundations but saratte 
said its an adventure so everyone goes down from sons of 
cabinet ministers to little punks 
quarries of lutecian limestone running under southern paris 
just a corner of the 188 miles of accessible catacombs are 
assigned to the dead the galleries are lined with the skulls and 
other bones of 6 million people some guillotined in the french 
revolution but most merely overflow from the crowded cemeteries of 
paris 
annemarie leparmentier a geologist with the general inspection 
of the quarries the city agency in charge since the 18th century 
said a reserve of bones is kept in other sections of the 
quarries but sometimes a skull disappears now that the 
cataphiles have come 
people have had regular access since the last century to the 
bone caverns at the place denfertrochereau in southern paris and 
regular tours are conducted the rest of the catacombs are reached 
by manhole under cover of darkness down a steel ladder to another 
world 
going underground became a fad more than a decade ago when 
students of the ecole nationale des mines nearly made it a ritual 
we ended up spending days finding people lost inside 
saratte said so all but eight of about 300 accesses to the 
catacombs have been soldered shut 
the quarries are the lowest level of subterranean paris which 
also is honeycombed with subway lines and 1313 miles of navigable 
sewers the vast underworld inspired victor hugo and later gaston 
leroux whose phantom of the opera hid out in that infernal 
underground maze 
around one corner is a bath carved into the rock by quarry 
workers centuries ago around the next an open well that may 
descend to the center of earth around still another lost in the 
catas help is scrawled on the wall 
some writings reek of threat or foreboding this is the domain 
of the klan avenue of the black mass im dead 
a shuffling sound comes from a corridor nearby the path forks 
and the swamp route beckons travelers slosh through the ancient 
mud of lutecia as paris was called in roman times 
eras collide in the catacombs 
punks skinheads and weekend revelers hold allnight seances in 
room z a large confusing amorphous cavity reached by slithering 
on the stomach through a narrow tunnel the walls are scrolls of 
obscenities swastikas and death wails 
subterranean paris is a very particular little world a little 
planet all its own where groups of regulars establish zones of 
influence said saratte the police inspector 
philip who uses only his first name said this world is 
divided into two races the tourists and the cataphiles the 
tourists are a hated race you have to do everything to chase 
them out 
actually it is a rather hostile milieu where criminals 
dont think of hiding out said michel laroche another geologist 
for the city quarries agency 
since the beginning the quarries of paris have attracted those 
either in hiding or in search of the celestial or the damned 
st denis patron saint of france said mass in the quarries 
during the christian persecution according to simon lacordaires 
book the secret history of subterranean paris 
some 13th century bandits hid under the chateau de vauvert 
replaced long ago by the luxembourg gardens lacordaire said 
sorcerers used the quarries for black masses especially during the 
1348 plague that filled the paris cemeteries and caused the living 
to search for solace in the occult 
in the last century merchants used the catacombs to smuggle 
untaxed blackmarket goods to clients 
official concern now centers on preserving the natural beauty of 
the quarries and fears that unauthorized travelers will harm the 
city foundations 
there have always been cataphiles but perhaps in the past 
they were more respectful laroche said it is not a sacred 
place but it is our patrimony 
overambitious excavations weakened the subterranean 
infrastructure there were reports a century ago of the earth 
swallowing homes on the boulevard st michel and neighboring 
streets laroche said the last fatal accident was a 1961 cavein at 
clamart a southern suburb that killed 20 people 
authorities began mapping and reinforcing the quarries in the 
mid18th century and do so today when the need arises quarrying 
has been prohibited since 1788

prague spring reforms were crushed 
tough police reaction to a mass protest in prague on friday and 
to a demonstration in august signaled that authorities will not 
tolerate public expressions of a desire for more freedom 
for the thousands of peaceful protesters the mass rallies could 
strengthen their resolve in demanding a more democratic society 
the next public show of support for such demands is likely to 
come on international human rights day on dec 10 a demonstration 
called that day last year by the charter 77 human rights movement 
attracted a few thousand people 
czechoslovakia was an independent democracy for 20 years before 
world war ii and has a long tradition of civil movements predating 
independence in 1918 
the 70th anniversary of that independence was the occasion for 
fridays rally in wenceslas square 24 hours after the authorities 
organized their own mass celebration of the anniversary for the 
first time in four decades of communist rule 
the two events were sharply contrasting with the official rally 
seeming ritualized and the banned independent gathering appearing a 
more genuine expression of national sentiment dissident filmmaker 
stanislav milota noted in an interview 
the government at their rally didnt sing the national 
anthem which was played by an interior ministry band and sung by 
an interior ministry choir and not taken up by the organized 
massed crowd milota noted 
by contrast on friday thousands sang the national anthem with 
great feeling before riot police with truncheons marched down the 
square toward a core of hundreds of protesters who stood their 
ground 
the authorities have made clear they will seek no contact with 
such people or unofficial groups as communist officials 
tentatively have in neighboring hungary 
there can be no dialogue here prague communist party chief 
miroslav stepan told thursdays official rally 
at 43 stepan a member of the ruling politburo is one of a new 
generation of communist leaders slowly rising into the ruling elite 
in a reshuffle by milos jakes who took over as party chief from 
gustav husak in december 
czechoslovaks had few expectations of reform from jakes who 
oversaw the purge of an estimated half million communists from the 
party after august 1968 when soviet and warsaw pact tanks put an 
end to the prague spring reform of husaks predecessor 
alexander dubcek 
a reshuffle this month confirmed jakes and his allies do not 
intend to follow soviet president mikhail s gorbachev into 
sweeping economic or political reforms 
the leading proponent of change in the top elite lubomir 
strougal lost his politburo seat and his post as premier 
according to a czechoslovak source his replacement ladislav 
adamec was one of a group of party members who backed soviet 
criticism of dubcek before the 1968 invasion 
the reshuffle also saw the first professional policeman named 
interior minister frantisek kincl who had overall responsibility 
for fridays tough police action and the strict security in force 
for days beforehand is a former police chief in northern and 
central moravia two areas known as the toughest on dissidents 
the police action and detention of at least 85 dissidents in one 
of the biggest preemptive crackdowns nationwide in years stood in 
stark contrast to soviet policy as presented a few days earlier by 
west german chancellor helmut kohl 
he announced that all soviet political prisoners would be freed 
by the end of the year 
other western nations greeted that announcement with skepticism 
but recent soviet policy does contrast with the trend in 
czechoslovakia toward what one prague resident summed up as 
retrenchment 
the dissident community meanwhile is inching forward to more 
overt political activity 
charter 77 has been primarily a human rights movement a loose 
association of an estimated 1300 signatories who issue documents 
on czechoslovak society and history and include former communist 
party members who still believe in socialism and many intellectuals 
who do not 
earlier this month several leading chartists including banned 
playwright vaclav havel joined a new movement for civil freedom 
which has formulated 11 demands for a multiparty democracy and a 
largely denationalized economy

as the pinktinged sunset fades over 
ruins of bombedout houses and kerosene lanterns start twinkling 
through the darkness the gunfire begins 
it lasts until sunrise to be followed intermittently through 
the day by the more distant boom of rockets aimed at the city 
herat afghanistans thirdlargest city with a population of 
106000 is one of the cities the moscowbacked government 
considers safe because soviet troops are still present 
the government professes to be able to defend the city against 
ussupported moslem guerrillas known as mujahedeen or islamic 
holy warriors even after the soviet pullout scheduled this winter 
the designation safe appears to be a delusion if not an 
outright fraud 
the guerrillas are about 12 to 13 miles from the city according 
to juma mohammad provincial commander of the sarandoy a 
paramilitary armored force considered more loyal and bettertrained 
than the afghan armys rank and file 
but the outgoing fire at night in herat seems aimed at an enemy 
much closer 
most of what can be heard from the balcony of a government 
building on the northern edge of the city sounds no bigger than 
50caliber whose range is about 1 miles 
the mortars used by sarandoy troops in herats 14th century 
citadel show signs of recent firing and are of the type that has a 
maximum range of about five miles 
in the afghan capital of kabul nonsoviet bloc diplomats 
predict herat will fall quickly to the mujahedeen after soviet 
troops pull out in accordance with a unmediated accord the 
withdrawal must be completed by feb 15 
but soviet troops left kandahar this past summer and the 
mujahedeen still have not dislodged the afghan garrison and taken 
that city the largest in the country after kabul the capital 
rockets also land in kabul several times a week sometimes by 
the scores most of the time the damage is insignificant 
but the cities are vulnerable more to siege tactics than to any 
direct military attack the mujahedeen can mount with their poorly 
targeted rockets 
the capture of kandahar or herat would deal a major 
psychological blow to afghanistans sovietstyle government 
afghanistans mountains afford sanctuary to the mujahedeen but 
it is the cities they must capture 
whether they can achieve victory through direct military 
attacks the mujahedeen are in a good position to isolate the 
cities from their supplies of food fuel and military 
reinforcements 
kabul gets a periodic taste of this when the mujahedeen cut the 
roads leading to the capital causing sugar to disappear from the 
markets and doubling the prices of dwindling stocks of flour 
herat is even more vulnerable fuel comes from the soviet union 
a twohour drive up the 95mile highway to the afghan border town 
of torghundi when the road is not blocked by winter snows or 
yearround guerrillas 
the fuel is needed not only for automobiles which are 
outnumbered in herat by horsedrawn vehicles and bicycles but for 
heating cooking and running the citys power plant 
the plan provides electricity only from sundown to sunrise and 
only for the few relatively prosperous neighborhoods government 
institutions and hospitals 
herat has never had aroundtheclock electricity not even 
before the war that began a decade ago when a coupinstalled 
communist government took power and quickly required soviet 
assistance to survive 
the guerrillas surrounding herat are led by one of the 
mujahedeens ablest commanders ismail khan of jamiateislami the 
largest of the seven pakistanibased guerrilla groups 
main roads and bridges around the city are now guarded by soviet 
troops 
sarandoy commander mohammad said he has 4000 men in herat 
province 600 of them in herat city in addition he said there 
are 2000 governmentpaid village militiamen and 4000 defenders 
of the revolution guntoting civilians the government pays 475 
to 715 a month 
mohammad said he had no idea how many mujahedeen were outside 
the city 
their activity is too secret it is difficult to say he 
said in an interview in his office where the secondstory windows 
were bricked up and sandbagged

last year after more than 1500 
people died in the collision of a packed ferry and an oil tanker 
investigations concluded that government agencies and shipowners 
habitually ignored maritime safety measures 
last weeks sinking of the ferry dona marilyn during a typhoon 
showed little has changed despite sea disasters that have killed 
thousands of people and left hundreds missing in the past year 
largely a seafaring people living in an archipelago filipinos 
rightfully expect a government attentive to the needs of sea 
travel a philippine senate study said in april instead they 
find a government disorganized in its treatment of sea travel and 
the shipping industry 
it speculated that neglect of the public safety in shipping was 
probably due to the fact that most who travel by sea are poor and 
cannot afford plane fares 
the house of representatives noted in another study that most of 
the 588 ports throughout the island nation were designed primarily 
to handle cargo and none has a passenger terminal 
the reports followed separate investigations by the two chambers 
into the december crash of the dona paz and an oil tanker official 
reports put the death toll at about 1700 but most estimates 
placed the actual figure at more than 3000 only 28 survived 
the senate report said that despite frequent fatal accidents 
the government had done so little that when the dona paz sank 
the bureaucracy had little to offer except kneejerk reactions 
and confusion 
despite pledges by shipowners and authorities to enforce rules 
on manifesting passengers neither knew the precise number of 
people aboard when typhoon ruby sank the dona marilyn the sister 
ship of the dona paz 
the coast guard recorded 379 passengers and 60 crew members 
carlos go president and general manager sulpicio lines which 
owned the ferry said 451 passengers and 66 crewmen were on the 
dona marilyn when it left manila oct 23 for the central philippine 
port of tacloban 
by sulpicios count at most 20 people were not listed on the 
manifest but manila newspapers said at least 52 survivors were not 
on the list 
president corazon aquino ordered an investigation saying that 
among other things she wanted to know why they sailed despite 
very bad weather 
commodore pio garrido commandant of the philippine coast guard 
which clears commercial ships for sailing to ensure safety 
regulations are followed said dona marilyn was allowed to sail 
because the weather was clear in manila 
previous warnings by the governments weather service showed the 
ships destination was in rubys path 
garrido said nothing in maritime regulations prevents a vessel 
from sailing if there is bad weather at its destination 
the investigations of the dona paz disaster showed virtually 
everything was wrong with the shipping industry both laid most of 
the blame on government neglect and apathy 
both reports said that not only was there a shortage of ships 
but communications equipment and navigational aids were obsolete 
and personnel poorly trained in addition maritime safety 
regulations could not be enforced because of corruption and 
overlapping regulatory agencies the reports said 
the reports noted that up to seven agencies were overseeing the 
shipping industry so that responsibility could easily be passed 
from one to the other it said corruption was such that operators 
could obtain lincenses for even the most unseaworthy vessels by 
bribing licensing officials 
the senate expressed surprise that despite the countrys heavy 
dependence on water transport only a total of 150 million had 
been invested in all aspects of the shipping industry 
it cited figures from the maritime industry authority showing 
that in 1986 the country had 3000 vessels of different sizes 
configurations and uses which moved a total of 16 million 
passengers and 396 million tons of cargo 
it said the average annual maritime death toll of 152 between 
198087 was already bad enough before the dona paz disaster raised 
it to 508 per annum the figure does not include hundreds of 
accidents involving unregistered outriggers in rural areas 
despite mrs aquinos promise of an investigation the 
philippine press has been skeptical that improvements will be made 
after every sea disaster there is usually a lot of talk about 
reforms in the shipping and maritime industry wrote the 
philippine star columnist art borjal but after all is said and 
done nothing much really happens and when another sea tragedy 
takes place the vicious cycle is repeated

prince charles took on the architectural 
establishment in his own television documentary and gained a 
powerful vote of confidence from ordinary citizens newspapers and 
even some architects 
a newspaper survey showed that more than 75 percent of britons 
agreed with the princes views that many architects and developers 
ignore peoples wishes and build ugly characterless buildings that 
are unpleasant to live in 
however bill rodgers director general of the royal institute 
of british architects responded sunday that there is too much 
hypocrisy and we are not going to allow architects to be made 
scapegoats 
charles maiden venture into television writing and performing 
was an outspoken and often humorous return to the subject of modern 
architecture which he has discussed publicly for several years he 
has angered leading architects and raised complaints that a member 
of the royal family has no business publicizing such views 
with 75 minutes of uninterrupted television time on the british 
broadcasting corp on friday night charles took a more positive 
approach showing viewers new buildings and developments he admired 
but his criticism of others was severe 
glancing at a low starkwhite structure among victorian 
buildings at the edge of the river thames charles commented 
thats redolent of a word processor to me and i dont see that 
people particularly want to live looking at a word processor 
the sunday telegraph newspaper called the show a tour de force 
that established the 39yearold heir to the throne as a great 
communicator the observer said it was admirable and sunday 
times columnist simon jenkins wished charles luck in a genuinely 
popular crusade 
other britons seemed to agree 
he follows what the ordinary man in the street believes i 
think about london it is being drowned out by skyscrapers said 
an unidentified woman in a tv interview saturday 
in its poll by telephone surveys ltd the sunday express said 
755 percent of 1000 people in a nationally representative sample 
agreed with charles 
almost 88 percent thought it right for members of the royal 
family to speak out on such issues no margin of error was given 
denys lasdun architect of the concrete national theater was 
asked by a bbc interviewer whether the prince should voice his 
opinions in public 
of course he should so should anybody its a public 
art lasdun said but because everyone shoots their mouth off 
it doesnt mean they talk sense 
charles called lasduns creation a clever way of building a 
nuclear power station in the middle of london without anyone 
objecting 
he called a projected london development by peter palumbo 
rather like a 1930s wireless radio 
i can only say god bless the prince of wales and god save 
us from his architectural judgment responded palumbo new 
chairman of the arts council which allocates state funds to 
britains arts 
max hutchinson presidentelect of the royal institute of 
british architects defended the latest generation of architects 
he said they have no greater love than the prince for much of 
what happened 20 or more years ago 
conservative party lawmaker sydney chapman the only architect 
in the house of commons backed charles in his attack on ugly 
multistory slabs of concrete but the legislator said they were 
principally the fault of politicians who rushed to rebuild cities 
damaged in world war ii 
in its pageone editorial the sunday telegraph said charles 
could become a major television personality 
it will only take a few more charismatic performances like 
last weeks for him to hold the nation in the palm of his hand 
the newspaper said

the prosecutor in a massive defense 
contracting probe says the complexity of the case not politics 
will delay indictments until after the nov 8 election 
henry e hudson the us attorney in alexandria va who is 
coordinating the multistate investigation also said indictments 
could continue for a year as a result of a probe into the 
150billionayear defense department purchasing system 
a federal grand jury resumes meeting nov 15 so indictments 
could come then which would be about five months after the fbi 
revealed the investigation by searching more than 40 premises 
across the country 
i am very optimistic on november indictments hudson said 
information about the case has been scarce because prosecutors have 
sealed most search warrants and affidavits 
the investigation centers on whether private consultants many 
of them former pentagon employees paid bribes to defense 
department officials for inside information about contracts 
chiefly within the navy 
hudson a republican denied any suggestion that indictments 
were slowed so that democratic presidential candidate michael 
dukakis could not make them an issue in his campaign against vice 
president george bush 
nothing would have given me greater pleasure than to hand down 
indictments in the first part of october hudson said in an 
interview 
but the prosecutor said the case has been administratively 
complex with attorneys forced to examine about 700000 documents 
and listen to thousands and thousands of tapes of two years of 
telephone interceptions 
federal and defense sources also indicate hudsons staff has 
been kept waiting for answers from some potential defendants who 
have been offered plea bargains 
adding to the task was the timeconsuming process of gathering 
financial evidence from foreign bank accounts which hudson 
described as an always delicate issue 
hudson said there were good reasons for thoroughness including 
the high national visibility of the case and the propensity 
for judges in virginia to schedule trials shortly after indictments 
are returned 
i will not present this indictment until we are ready for 
trial and we feel we will be ready within the next month he 
said as the case evolves indictments and trials could be held in 
other cities sources said 
hudson did not discuss charges that could be filed but the use 
of internal revenue service agents on the case suggests that tax 
charges may be contemplated in addition to the more obvious counts 
of theft of government property bribery fraud and conspiracy to 
defraud the government 
fifteen attorneys some of them working 12hour days and 
weekends plus 75 federal agents from the fbi the naval 
investigative service and the irs have been assigned to the case 
which hudson called the largest case ever handled in the eastern 
district of virginia 
hudson refused to say how many indictments he expected to be 
returned initially but noted that courtroom space generally 
confines the number to less than 12 
though hudson declined to name the targets of the investigation 
he did not rule out members of congress 
all individuals that may have been engaged in wrongdoing or 
committed a criminal act in connection with the defense procurement 
process will be scrutinized and prosecuted if appropriate he 
said 
hudson disputed reports that he had told members of congress 
during the summer that none was a target i never made such a 
statement he said 
i told the members of the house of representatives that no 
member of congress had been the subject of electronic surveillance 
had received a subpoena to testify in front of the grand jury at 
that time or had been the subject of a search warrant he said 
court papers filed in brooklyn ny indicate prosecutors are 
looking at allegations that campaign contributions were extorted 
raids in new york came at the business of james kane who set up 
the long island aerospace political action committee to make 
contributions that might help area defense contractors and at the 
home of dennis mitchell a unisys corp official identified as 
turning over contributions to rep roy dyson dmd who sits on 
the house armed services committee dyson has denied any wrongdoing 
the name of another committee member rep bill chappell jr 
has also surfaced in connection with the probe chappell says he 
has done nothing wrong 
among those whose names have been linked to the investigation 
are five pentagon officials including james gaines deputy 
assistant navy secretary for acquisition and management melvyn 
paisley a consultant who was assistant secretary of the navy for 
research engineering and systems before leaving government in 
1987 and william galvin another defense consultant

this years drought is not likely to be 
repeated in 1989 and us farmers probably will harvest bumper 
crops of wheat corn and soybeans according to an agriculture 
department economist 
corn production for example could nearly double from this 
years droughtriddled yield 
but james cole of the departments economic research service 
warned that a backlog of demand will siphon off most of the 1989 
crop increases without allowing the united states to rebuild its 
stockpiles significantly 
production of all commodities almost certainly will be much 
greater next year but consumption of wheat corn and soybeans also 
will remain high resulting in only limited increases in stocks 
during 198990 cole said 
the odds are good for such a harvest improvement in 1989 he 
said since 1970 drought has shriveled us crops five times 
1970 1974 1980 1983 and 1988 and in each case harvest yields 
were up significantly the following year 
according to coles analysis which was prepared for the 
november issue of agricultural outlook magazine 1989 wheat 
production may rebound to about 25 billion bushels from 18 
billion bushels this year corn to 75 billion to 8 billion bushels 
from 44 billion in 1988 and soybeans to almost 2 billion bushels 
from this years harvest of 15 billion 
cole said the larger crops of 1989 will be used to sustain 
growing consumption by domestic and foreign users therefore he 
added inventories may rise only slightly by the end of the 
198990 crop year 
the real impact of the drought markedly reduced stocks 
will remain for some time to come cole said some rebuilding 
of inventories that had been severely depleted in 198889 is 
expected but gains will be small larger increases if desired 
will take more time 
despite the odds that the 1988 drought will not be repeated next 
year the possibility still exists no matter how unsavory the 
subject is for usda officials 
lester brown president of worldwatch institute a nonprofit 
research organization based in washington recently said that 
another us drought in 1989 would trigger a desperate scramble 
by needy countries for dwindling grain supplies 
cole explained further about droughts track record in the 
united states and how it backs up his contention that 1989 may be a 
bumper crop year 
unlike other countries the united states has not had 
backtoback droughts in at least 75 years he said the soviet 
union recently endured as many as four successive years of drought 
us weather history and prospects give little reason to believe 
that crop yields will not rebound next year 
moreover he said rainfall in september and october has helped 
replenish badly depleted soil moisture in parts of the corn and 
soybean belts and across the southeast longterm forecasts call 
for average or slightly aboveaverage chances for normal 
precipitation this fall 
even so most of the upper midwest and southeast still require 
as much as 6 to 10 inches of rainfall this fall and winter to 
restore soil moisture to more normal levels cole said 
temperatures are likely to be somewhat higher than normal 
some other reasons cited by cole for expecting 1989 crop 
production to rise sharply 
the usda has used provisions of the 1985 farm law to reduce the 
amount of land farmers must idle in order to qualify for price 
supports and other program benefits including deficiency 
payments or direct subsidies 
for 1989 as an example only 10 percent of a farmers feed 
grain base acreage will have to be set aside compared with 20 
percent this year wheat farmers also will have to idle only 10 
percent instead of 275 percent for 1988 
the disaster assistance act of 1988 which provides drought aid 
to stricken farmers also permits usda to let farmers plant 
soybeans or sunflowers on corn acres without losing acreage credit 
for future program calculations 
although 1989 soybean plantings are likely to expand less than 
either wheat or corn production is expected to rise substantially 
soybean acreage in the south has been declining for several 
years as farmers returned land to fallow or other uses recovery 
could begin in 1989 but it will take sustained higher prices to 
boost the souths soybean acreage to levels of the late 1970s when 
prices were high and exports boomed 
consumption of wheat corn and soybeans is expected to 
increase in 198990 cole said domestic food seed and 
industrial uses likely will be near present levels however global 
grain and oilseed use probably will increase slightly 
cole added export growth will be spurred further by increased 
demand from developing countries as the value of the dollar 
remains relatively low price declines accompanying next years 
harvest will make it easier for importing nations to maintain or 
expand purchases in 198990

if the marbled murrelet turns out to be an 
endangered bird it may endanger loggers plans to take timber from 
some of the oldest forests in north america 
the fish and wildlife service in a littlenoticed decision 
published in the federal register agreed to consider listing the 
marbled murrelet as an endangered species 
the agency found that a national audubon society petition for 
listing the bird presented substantial information indicating 
that the requested action may be warranted 
not much is known about the marbled murrelet a robinsized 
seabird that seems to swim better than it walks or flies but 
scientists are convinced the bird nests almost exclusively in the 
oldgrowth timber that towers over the coastal regions of the 
northwest some of the oldest forests in north america 
listing the bird as endangered or threatened could result in a 
ban on cutting trees that are prized by the timber industry for 
their topquality logs and premium market price 
timber industry officials accuse environmentalists of using the 
marbled murrelet to attempt a backdoor prohibition against 
oldgrowth timber harvesting on public lands 
it sounds like a red herring said jay goldstein a 
spokesman for the washington forest protection association which 
includes among its members some of the largest forestproducts 
companies in the northwest 
we need to decide what to do and get on with it said 
goldstein but lets not play games and use soft little birds to 
defraud the process these neverending tactics aimed at foiling 
the process are irresponsible 
environmentalists dont deny that they are waging a battle to 
halt the cutting of oldgrowth timber but add that the marbled 
murrelet is worthy of protection in its own right 
we are going to make the survival of the ancient forest a 
national issue said brock evans an audubon society vice 
president this is not just a problem for the northwest everyone 
owns these forests its like saying the grand canyon only belongs 
to the people of arizona 
caught in the middle is the fish and wildlife service which 
recently declared that another bird that nests in oldgrowth 
timber the spotted owl wasnt worthy of listing as endangered or 
threatened that decision is now being reviewed in a lawsuit 
brought in federal court in portland ore 
what we have to answer is how important is old growth to the 
marbled murrelet said jim bottroff a fish and wildlife 
biologist based in portland 
the audubon society believes that the bird could eventually 
become extinct if logging of the oldgrowth forest continues 
according to biologists estimates only 3400 breeding pairs of 
marbled murrelets remain in washington state maybe 2400 breeding 
pairs in oregon and less than 1000 in northern california 
estimates for alaska range up to 50000 breeding pairs and the 
bird is also found in western canada 
jim pissot an audubon society specialist said that since the 
turn of the century people have been trying to discover where the 
marbled murrelet nests 
now we know or think we know 150 feet up on the thick 
branches of oldgrowth trees said pissot they are very 
dependent on old growth 
environmentalists believe that more than 160 species may be 
dependent for survival on oldgrowth forests 
the spotted owl and the marbled murrelet are just the tip of 
the iceberg said evans they dramatize what is at stake 
the us forest service has estimated that about 75 million 
acres of old growth remains in the northwest with more than 80 
percent of it on national forest lands 
plans call for cutting about half of that total over the next 50 
years and forest service officials have warned that unless it is 
cut the regions timber industry could collapse 
environmentalists say the forest service estimates are grossly 
inflated and even include trees that were destroyed by the 1980 
eruption of mount st helens 
they also say that the old growth is being cut at the rate of 
more than 170 acres a day the equivalent of roughly 129 football 
fields 
congress asked the forest service to survey the remaining old 
growth and to come up with a common definition for an ancient tree 
a forest service task force earlier defined oldgrowth trees as 
being at least 200 years old and almost three feet in diameter 
environmentalists say that definition is too narrow and that 
officials also should take into account how many of the trees are 
in a given area and whether it has the characteristics of a mature 
forest

chemical pesticides used to kill cropdamaging 
bugs too often destroy the pests natural predators as well says a 
group promoting use of the insect worlds good guys to protect 
food supplies 
the consultative group on international agricultural research 
which holds its annual meeting here next week has compiled a 
number of examples from around the world to bolster its position 
it says for instance that the island republic of indonesia 
alone could save up to 100 million a year by cutting down on 
chemical pesticides and using other bugs to fight the ones that 
hurt the rice crop 
the group represents 13 international research centers around 
the world including those responsible for starting the green 
revolution in maize and other crops they are trying to obtain 
238 million for a fiveyear biological fight against pests 
damage by pests to cassava on which 200 million africans 
depend has been estimated at 2 billion a year americans know 
cassava best as tapioca and use it occasionally in puddings in 
africa and other third world areas it is a staple food 
one economist calculated that a little wasp brought from 
paraguay saved over 400 million worth of cassava in africa last 
year by eating large quantities of mealybugs the chief culprit in 
the losses 
richard b norgaard who teaches farm economics at the 
university of california berkeley wrote that the wasp program 
saved farmers 149 for every dollar spent on it 
merle shepard used to be the top man on insects of the 
international rice research institute at los banos in the 
philippines he now teaches about useful and harmful insects at 
clemson university in clemson sc 
there are about 800 species of good guys in the field he 
said in most cases they outnumber the bad guys five to three 
a major enemy of the rice plant is the brown planthopper one 
wolf spider will kill 20 to 30 of them in a day saving an 
estimated 3 worth of rice a season 
the trick is to find the best bugs test them release them and 
get them established where they can do most good 
shepard told reporters that chemical pesticides can hurt farming 
as well as help by killing the useful as well as the harmful 
insects a study on indonesia earlier this year by the united 
nations food and agriculture organization said 
only when these predators were killed by unnecessary 
insecticide treatments did the brown planthopper escape natural 
control and become a serious pest 
shepard said some pesticides must be used but that they can be 
eliminated 70 percent to 90 percent of the time 
the use of biological methods goes back to the ancient chinese 
who set predatory ants against some insects that attacked citrus 
fruit the most recent list of such attempts compiled in 1976 
reports 327 successes 
hans herren is a swiss who works in the international institute 
of tropical agriculture at ibadan nigeria he said un figures 
show that 40000 third world farmers are killed and 150000 are 
injured every year from the use of pesticides 
a study last year by the us national research council reported 
several hundred deaths from pesticides a year in this country 
during the 1970s it estimated that tens of thousands of people 
fell ill because of the chemicals 
the international research group says the use of bugs birds and 
microbes as well as chemicals to help fight pests can be cheaper 
healthier and more effective than only spraying with pesticides 
but it is also a lot more trouble which may be one reason it has 
not caught on more in richer countries 
farmers dont like counting bugs shepard said

the oldest and largest trade group of savings 
institutions opened its annual convention today intent on 
persuading congress to help the ailing industry with a 
multibilliondollar bailout and preserve it as a system separate 
from commercial banks 
the nations 3048 savings institutions lost 75 billion in the 
first six months of this year and losses almost surely will top 
last years postdepression record of 78 billion 
an estimated 4050 delegates and spouses to the us league of 
savings institutions 96th annual convention have gathered in the 
palmringed luxury hotels along waikiki beach to map strategy for 
1989 when congress likely will make decisions affecting the 
industry for years to come 
the federal home loan bank board which regulates the industry 
estimates the cost of restoring all sampls to solvency at 45 billion 
to 50 billion but private analysts put the price tag as high as 
100 billion 
bank board chairman m danny wall scheduled to address the 
convention on thursday said his agency will have enough money to 
do the job but only if thrift institutions are charged a special 
assessment for deposit insurance for the next 30 years 
sampls say they cant afford it and are looking to congress to 
come up with the additional money 
its a 30year mortgage we just flat out cant handle said 
theo h pitt jr chairman of pioneer savings bank in rocky mount 
nc and outgoing chairman of the industry group 
the bank board this year has shut down more than 135 
institutions or merged them with stronger partners but at midyear 
497 insolvent institutions were still open another 408 were 
solvent but losing money 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp financed by 
assessments on the industry was set up to insure deposits in sampls 
but it has been weakened by the flurry of failures sampls already 
pay more than twice as much for deposit insurance as commercial 
banks 208 cents per 1000 of deposits for sampls compared with 
83 cents for banks 
pitt contends that continuing the extra assessment originally 
scheduled to be phased out in three years would push otherwise 
profitable institutions into insolvency creating an everenlarging 
problem 
so far this year the extra assessment has made the difference 
between profit and loss for 69 institutions he said 
clearly there is a limit to what the solvent institutions can 
do he said 
congress when it decides how to pay the bill whether through a 
direct appropriation from the treasury or through some sort of 
taxpayerbacked guarantee will almost certainly include measures 
aimed at preventing the problem from recurring 
although much of the industrys problems are concentrated in 
depressed oilproducing states in the southwest they have been 
magnified in texas california and florida by lax state regulation 
that permitted thrift institutions to make risky investments far 
removed from traditional home mortgage lending 
many in the industry had pushed for permission to diversify in 
the early 1980s when soaring interest rates made it impossible for 
thrifts to make money on their old fixedrate mortgages the 
argument was that a greater range of activities would help 
institutions pull themselves out of the hole 
as it turned out pitt said the institutions that strayed most 
from traditional mortgage lending earned the least 
the ones that have gotten into trouble were the ones who took 
the most advantage of the new powers he said 
rep gerald kleczka dwis and other members of congress say 
that after all the insolvent sampls are closed or merged with 
stronger partners the entire sampl system should be merged with the 
commercial bank system 
but pitt says american home buyers need a separate sampl system 
a study by the us league this summer showed that thrifts and 
mortgage banking companies owned by thrifts provided 54 percent of 
the countrys residential mortgages last year 
i believe congress is beginning to recognize that we havent 
abandoned our traditional role pitt said if we dont do it 
youre going to have to reinvent the system 
he said the league will be recommending regulatory changes in 
what he called a never again scenario among the likely 
recommendations he said would be stricter limits on direct 
investment in commercial real estate projects and on the amount 
that can be loaned to a single customer

the united states is entering into a 
worldwide treaty providing reciprocal copyright protection for 
american artists and writers and those of 76 other countries 
in a ceremony in a hotel meeting room today president reagan 
was signing legislation bringing american copyright law into 
compliance with the 102yearold bern convention for the protection 
of literary and artistic works 
the senate ratified the treaty on oct 20 but legislation 
making changes in american copyright laws was also needed before 
the united states could become a fullfledged member of the 
convention 
differences between american and other nations copyright laws 
stalled ratification for decades but many of the obstacles were 
removed when congress enacted a sweeping overhaul of us copyright 
law in 1976 
participation in the convention will enable the united states to 
have copyright relations with 24 countries with which it now has 
none officials said 
the convention was signed in bern on sept 9 1886 it spells 
out minimum copyright standards detailing what is protected and 
how long the copyright lasts it also bars member nations from 
discriminating against protected works from other member states 
the signing ceremony was the only public event on the 
presidents schedule today 
on sunday reagan and his wife nancy traveled from their ranch 
north of santa barbara to receive awards from the simon wiesenthal 
center an organization dedicated to the study of the holocaust 
in a speech accepting the centers 1988 humanitarian award the 
president said his administration has made us ties with israel 
warmer than they have ever been and added 
we must remain strong and we must be willing to use force 
when we are under threat this is a lesson that binds us still 
closer to the state of israel for the fact is a strong israel 
depends upon a strong america 
reagan also announced that he will soon sign enabling 
legislation passed this year to facilitate us adherence to the 
united nations convention on genocide which the senate ratified in 
1986 after a long campaign by sen william proxmire dwis aides 
said the president is expected to sign the legislation on thursday 
in washington 
the award to the president was given for his efforts on behalf 
of peace and his support of israel 
it was presented at a dinner held on the 80th birthday of simon 
wiesenthal who has worked with the us and other governments in 
locating nazi war criminals wiesenthal joined the president and 
others at the head table 
the president who left the white house last thursday 
campaigned for the republican ticket in arkansas missouri and 
california and made a foreign policy address here before spending 
the weekend at the ranch

the damage has been repaired and the 
continuing aftershocks are mostly imperceptible and some say the 
great temblor that shook central idaho and killed two children five 
years ago is being forgotten 
it was a beautiful day until the earth started shaking 
remembered oval caskey mayor of the small town of mackay it 
just shook everything down to the roots 
the quake struck near the little river valley town of challis on 
the morning of oct 28 1983 at 73 on the richter scale it was 
the nations most powerful earthquake in nearly 20 years and one of 
the countrys strongest ever recorded 
the quake visibly rolled up the valley undulating the ground 
like an ocean wave and making its shock felt as far away as 
southwestern north dakota or more than 600 miles 
the states tallest mountain 12662foot borah peak was at the 
epicenter the quake lifted it a foot dropped the valley to the 
west 4 feet and created a 12milelong fault line still visible 
today 
two school children died in the valley thats home to about 
1400 people damage in challis and mackay ran into the millions of 
dollars 
i was never worried about earthquakes before said mike 
gallagher owner of round valley supply in challis but every 
time you feel a tremor your heart stops for a second and you wonder 
if this is another big one 
residents worked quickly to repair the damage though and the 
government built a city hall in mackay and several new schools in 
the valley 
theyre a tough bunch said walt weymouth who recently 
moved from challis to northern california they submerged their 
feelings and simply went on with their lives 
janet franck is one of them her 6yearold son travis was 
killed by the falling rubble along with 7yearold tara leaton as 
they walked to school in challis 
im a person who believes the past is in the past and it 
should be left there mrs franck said bringing it back up 
just opens a lot of old wounds 
aftershocks have dwindled to only a few each week and only a 
fraction of them are felt beyond scientists seismographs 
attitudes have lightened so much that when an aftershock has 
been big enough like last summers 47 tremor clerks in the 
custer county courthouse have set up a betting pool for estimating 
the final richter scale reading 
scientists like bob smith of the university of utah express 
worries that information gleaned from the quake has been ignored 
we can take what weve learned there now and say what would 
happen if we had an equivalent earthquake in say salt lake 
city which lies on the wasatch fault 
but he cautioned the people who are in the position to 
utilize this kind of data the landuse planners the legislative 
people seem to operate on shortterm problems the lessons 
learned from borah peak dont seem to have made much of an impact 
yet 
idaho disaster services director darrell waller said the state 
has scheduled a major earthquake disaster exercise for next spring 
but he acknowledged that building codes havent been revised and 
said a disaster of greater magnitude may be needed to prompt such 
changes 
had that event happened and affected seriously a major city 
it would not have been so quickly forgotten he said

utilities nationwide are closely watching a 
cleanair case involving a wisconsin power company because it could 
affect future renovation projects at hundreds of older plants 
across the country 
the environmental protection agency has told wisconsin electric 
power co that it will have to meet more stringent standards for 
new plants if it goes ahead with planned repairs at a coalfired 
power plant 
the industry has long assumed that such renovation projects were 
exempt from the tougher cleanair rules that apply to new plants 
epas ruling is the first of its kind 
i think they are flat wrong said henry nickel chief lawyer 
for the utility air regulatory group which represents utilities 
epas decision he said contradicts current regulations 
bob beck environmental manager for the edison electric 
institute trade association of the nations private utilities 
said epas ruling could amount to a de facto acid rain program 
the energy department has taken the utilities side protesting 
to epa that the decision could jeopardize future power supplies or 
make them more costly utilities say they may simply close plants 
or forgo repairs if the newplant standards will apply 
but david hawkins an attorney for the natural resources defense 
council said epa is making the right call 
its about time they put some life and teeth into the 
requirements that significant renovation qualifies a plant as new 
the plant involved is the port washington station in suburban 
milwaukee whose five 80megawatt generating units were installed 
from 1935 to 1950 
in 1984 the company discovered severe cracks in steam drums the 
following year one of the five units was taken off line and steam 
pressure reduced in the other four for an overall drop in capacity 
of 40 percent 
now the company plans to replace the steam drums in a project 
costing 71 million wisconsin electric argues that this is routine 
maintenance that ought to be exempt from review 
but in an oct 14 letter to the company informing it of the 
decision epa administrator lee m thomas said the company had told 
state regulators the project was not routine that 46 million of 
the expense was a capital expenditure that capacity had 
deteriorated before 1984 for other reasons and that other 
equipment also would be replaced to help restore original capacity 
thomas said emissions will go back up once the plant resumes 
fullpower generation and that the increase will result from a 
capital rather than a maintenance expenditure 
the argument that the utility plans only to restore original 
capacity is not relevant under those circumstances he said 
sulfur dioxide is the most important pollutant at issue formed 
from sulfur in the fuel it is transformed in the atmosphere into 
sulfuric acid leading to acid rain 
a new plant today would be limited to 06 to 12 pounds of 
sulfur per million btus provided by the fuel at the same time it 
would have to remove 70 percent to 90 percent of the sulfur 
originally in the coal 
port washington now burns coal emitting 25 pounds of sulfur per 
million btus epa estimates that port washingtons hourly emissions 
of sulfur dioxide would increase from current levels by 69 percent 
after the renovation 
as a practical matter the only way to prevent that increase 
would be to install smokestack scrubbers something that 
according to one industry rule of thumb could cost about 80 
million at port washington more than the repairs and reduce the 
plants electrical output by 5 percent 
wisconsin power is negotiating with epa in a bid to avoid that 
expense lisa fox a company spokeswoman declined to discuss 
specifics of the negotiations though she did confirm that 
fuelswitching to oil or gas is an option 
though us sulfur dioxide emissions have been falling since the 
mid1970s environmentalists say they would have fallen faster if 
more old plants had been replaced by new plants 
extending the life of old plants wasnt even on the radar 
screen in 1979 when the current regulations were promulgated 
said hawkins who was then with the epa and helped draft the rules 
now according to the energy department plants more than 30 
years old are expected to account for 25 percent of all 
fossilfueled generating capacity in 1990 and 90 percent in 2010

on the eve of a new round of peace talks iran and 
iraq each released 25 prisoners of war and un chief javier perez 
de cuellar said he would promptly seek the repatriation of the 
thousands that remain 
the united nations secretary general told reporters on arrival 
sunday that he hoped the third round of talks that begins today 
would soon yield positive results specifically on the exchange 
of prisoners 
but he has said his first target as mediator to have both sides 
agree to the disengagement of forces that a un report says have 
remained in dangerous proximity since aug 20 when a truce 
halted the 8yearold war 
the un iraniraq military observers group which is monitoring 
the ceasefire says in the report that in some places troops are 
separated by just 30 feet of no mans land 
perez de cuellar said he planned to discuss the prisonerofwar 
issue this morning with the president of the international 
committee of the red cross and expected to meet later today with 
the delegations of both sides 
a un report estimates iran and iraq hold a combined total of 
up to 105000 prisoners of war though the red cross has registered 
just 50182 in iran and 19284 in iraq 
so far iran has freed 790 prisoners and iraq 638 according to 
the red cross 
on sunday iraq freed 25 disabled iranian prisoners and they 
were flown to tehran the capital of iran aboard a plane chartered 
by the red cross iran reciprocated immediately by releasing 25 
iraqi prisoners who boarded the same plane for the return flight to 
baghdad iraq according to francoise derand a spokesman at the 
red cross office in geneva 
iraq has agreed in principle to release all prisoners and says 
their freedom should not have to be worked out in the peace talks 
but iran has said the exchange must be based on the un resolution 
under which the ceasefire took hold and on a plan drafted by perez 
de cuellar 
that plan provides for a timetable for implementing all ten 
points of the ceasefire resolution ranging from the 
prisonerofwar exchange to assessment of damages and an inquiry 
into who started the war 
perez de cuellar said sunday night that he hoped the geneva 
talks would be if possible much more useful than the previous 
round held in new york early this month 
both iran and iraq have not budged on the principal issue 
stalemating the talks since they began in geneva on aug 25 
delineation of the border between the two nations 
iran says a 1975 treaty set the border in the middle of the 
shattalarab waterway iraqs only navigable outlet to the sea 
iraq repudiated the treaty in 1980 and demands sovereignty over the 
entire waterway 
foreign minister tariz aziz of iraq who heads his countrys 
delegation to the talks told reporters at the airport on sunday 
that iraq did not go to new york for substantial negotiations 
let us resume direct talks in geneva where we can stay for a 
while as long as the job needs he said now we will negotiate 
on this matter with the iranians 
he said iran whose delegation is headed by foreign minister ali 
akbar velayati is to blame that we are still on the same place 
in the peace talks where we left in geneva and in new york

a covert cia program to aid noncommunist 
rebels in cambodia is operating at reduced levels following 
discovery that military officers in thailand had siphoned off some 
35 million according to intelligence sources and a published 
report 
the corruption scandal which may also have involved some thai 
businessmen was reported in sundays washington post and confirmed 
in part by other sources who declined to be identified by name 
the program one of several reagan administration initiatives to 
bolster anticommunist forces in conflicts around the world has 
since been cleaned up but is operating at reduced levels more 
rigorous accounting procedures are in place the newspaper reported 
it said cia officers in thailand first turned up evidence that 
money had been skimmed from the covert aid program which totaled 
12 million in fiscal 1988 some of the cambodian rebels operate 
from neighboring thailand 
the agency then tipped off the senate intelligence committee 
which sent a fourmember audit team to thailand the team part of 
a beefedup independent auditing capability instituted by committee 
chairman sen david boren dokla and cochairman william cohen 
rmaine confirmed the existence of the scheme 
the teams report back to the intelligence panel on july 12 
sparked disagreement over whether the covert support should be 
continued the post reported citing a state department document 
detailing the developments 
at the time the administration was seeking to increase support 
to resistance forces opposing vietnamese troops inside cambodia 
the programs aim is to establish a noncommunist presence that 
could prevent the return of the communist khmer rouge when the 
vietnamese pull troops out of cambodia 
after a debate within the intelligence panel it was decided to 
continue the program but to reduce the amount of us support to 
8 million in the current year and to institute strict procedures 
for making sure the money is spent for its intended purposes 
nonlethal items and training 
the audit team later returned to thailand to review how new 
controls were working and found solid evidence that proper 
accounting was in place the post reported 
the covert program in cambodia begun in 1982 or 1983 had until 
then provoked little controversy and had received far less public 
exposure than similar administration programs to support 
anticommunist rebels in nicaragua angola and afghanistan 
boren declined to comment directly on the post story but issued 
a statement saying he was deeply troubled by the reference to a 
state department document provided by an executive branch source 
i have asked both the secretary of state and the director of 
the cia to determine if anyone in the executive branch has indeed 
been compromising classified documents boren said

the israeli army is in the streets in the villages in the towns

as labor party leader shimon peres 
walked through a crowded town market on a handshaking campaign 
tour a loyalist of the rival likud bloc confronted him with an 
angry question 
i worked at alliance tire for 20 years and now ive lost my 
job the man screamed what are you going to do about it 
peres upset by hecklers drowning out his speech shouted back 
that the man should apply for unemployment 
the acrimonious scene was a reminder that though the 
palestinian uprising has been the focus of israels election 
campaign economic problems will be a major task facing whoever is 
in office after tuesdays elections 
economists are warning of a possible recession a growing crisis 
facing israeli industry and a sharp rise in unemployment several 
large unions threatened strikes even as election day approached 
about 15000 employees at three major israeli banks held a 
oneday strike sunday leaders of the histadrut the nations trade 
union federation allied to the leftofcenter labor party 
convinced most of them to return to work today the workers some 
of whom earn as little as 600 a month are demanding higher pay 
also gasoline truckers demanding a 45 percent wage increase 
nearly walked off the job but the strike was averted when prime 
minister yitzhak shamir agreed to discuss the truckers demands at 
sundays cabinet meeting 
last week koor the nations largest industrial conglomerate 
employing 27000 people had to be bailed out by the government 
after it defaulted on a 20 million loan 
shamir who heads the rightwing likud party immediately turned 
that into a rallying cry for an end to laborbacked policies that 
traditionally have preserved jobs regardless of the cost 
the concept of the labor party belongs to the past it belongs 
to east europe at the beginning of the century shamir said in a 
speech calling for a free economy and free enterprise 
peres though he has a say in the coalition government along 
with shamir responded by blaming likud for tight money policies 
and high interest rates that have hampered industrial growth and 
moved the economy precariously close to recession 
today there are 3000 plants in distress peres charged in a 
televised debate with shamir what plant can pay 30 percent to 35 
percent interest this entire policy rocks the economy 
how voters will respond to the rhetoric remains unclear hanoch 
smith an independent pollster says surveys so far have shown a 
standoff between the two main parties on economic issues 
labor appears more vulnerable than likud because the histadrut 
owns or controls many of the ailing industries chief among them 
koor and the nations largest insurance company 
a few months ago the histadruts ailing alliance tire amp rubber 
co northeast of tel aviv was put in the hands of a stateappointed 
receiver and israeli banks put up 8 million in emergency loans to 
keep the company afloat 
after a threemonth closure the plant was reopened oct 5 but 
250 workers including the one who confronted peres were not 
recalled 
economists say israelis current industrial problems stem in 
part from its success in dealing with another economic evil faced 
when the coalition came to power in 1984 inflation 
that year consumer prices were rising a record 445 percent a 
year 
in july 1985 the government enacted an emergency 
stabilization program with wage and price freezes stringent 
monetary controls and tight budget policies that have brought 
inflation down to about 16 percent a year 
although the government has eased up since to allow limited wage 
and price increases continuing high interest rates and strict 
exchange rate controls have squeezed business profits 
in addition the palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip has sapped millions of dollars from the tourist 
industry and from businesses that traditionally depend on arab 
workers such as construction and textiles 
one westerntrained economist who insisted on anonymity 
predicted the israeli economy would grow 1 percent or less this 
year well below the governments target of 37 percent and down 
sharply from last years 52 percent growth 
the nations unemployment rate has risen from 56 percent at the 
end of 1987 to nearly 6 percent in the first half of 1988 and some 
economists believe it hit 7 percent in the julyseptember quarter

some people flocked to the countryside 
to see if martians had landed while others fled in fear after a 
local radio station broadcast a 50thanniversary rendition of orson 
welles war of the worlds 
the 90minute broadcast on sunday had been advertised in 
preceding days but nevertheless sparked scores of calls to police 
and fire services in braga a northern city of 63000 people 
the curious drove to an area outside town where radio braga 
reported aliens from mars were landing officials said the 
frightened began fleeing in cars according to news reports from 
the area 
lines reportedly formed at some gas stations in braga 200 miles 
north of the capital lisbon 
the broadcast was a recreation of welles radio dramatization of 
the hg wells novel the war of the worlds 
on oct 30 1938 the actor and director interrupted radio 
broadcasts in the united states with a report that martians had 
landed in new jersey that broadcast caused hundreds of thousands 
of people to panic 
in braga police were called to control 150 to 200 demonstrators 
who gathered outside the studios of radio braga to protest the 
broadcast of the recreation of welles version said paulo sousa a 
reporter at the station 
sousa said the station received more than 100 calls some 
called to complain some to inquire and some to offer 
congratulations he said in a telephone interview 
sousa said the broadcast was intended as an homage to welles and 
had been well publicized previously in newspapers and on the radio 
station itself he said the program itself also contained clues 
that it was fiction 
a police spokesman in braga who asked not to be named 
confirmed police had been called to the radio station he said many 
people believed the broadcast initially but added that no serious 
incidents were reported

bud clark exchanged his bartenders apron 
for the mayors mantle four years ago and barring a longshot 
victory by one of the three police chiefs to leave his 
administration will remain a mixologist of policy not drinks 
ron still who resigned as police chief after clark took office 
advanced to the nov 8 runoff election after winning 336 percent 
of the primary vote 
eleven candidates fragmented the vote and clark fell just short 
of topping the 50 percent plus one vote need to avert a runoff 
a poll by katutv oct 13 showed clark leading still 58 percent 
to 32 percent with 10 percent undecided the margin of error was 
plus or minus 5 points 
clark owner of the popular goose hollow tavern points to such 
accomplishments during his first term as voter approval of a bond 
measure for a convention center and formulation of a plan to deal 
with the citys homeless 
still has made veiled criticisms of clarks eccentricities 
which include a victory cry of whoop whoop once performed on 
the tonight show starring johnny carson and a penchant for 
wearing shorts and suspenders 
clark once posed for a poster that carried the caption expose 
yourself to art and showed a back view of a man opening an 
overcoat in front of a statue 
portland needs a mayor who knows when to wear lederhosen and 
when to wear a threepiece suit still said early in the campaign 
a lot of people say they want their mayor to look and act like 
someone who can run a multimilliondollar corporation said 
carolyn gaudry stills campaign manager 
for his part clark said he is one of many mayors who have 
used certain antics in drawing attention to their city 
still also has criticized clark for his handling of the police 
stills resignation led to clarks selection of penny harrington as 
the nations first female chief of a bigcity police department 
she resigned after a mayoral commission criticized her 
management style clark replaced her with jim davis but later 
fired davis during an argument at a cafe 
still has tried to pin portlands crime problem to clark under 
whose administration the citys first gangrelated shootings 
occurred gang members seeking to increase their drug markets 
have flocked from los angeles to portland and other western cities 
under his tenure clark responded this city of 420000 
residents has succeeded in reducing the frequency of some crimes 
such as burglary fighting crime would be a high priority in his 
next term he said 
aides to clark and still say each side will have spent about 
500000 by the nov 8 election making this the most expensive 
campaign in city history for the 60000peryear mayors job 
the race officially is nonpartisan but clark showed his 
allegiance to the democratic party during its presidential 
nominating convention when he announced the vote of the oregon 
delegation still is republican

the dollar fell against the japanese yen monday 
while share prices inched up on the tokyo stock exchange 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues finished trading 
at 2798254 adding 2153 points or 008 percent the index 
closed at 2796101 saturday 
the dollar closed at 12500 down 108 yen from fridays close 
of 12608 yen opening at 12572 yen the currency moved in a range 
of 1249812585 yen 
exchange dealers attributed the weaker dollar to a decline in 
the currency on overseas markets they said there was a general 
perception that the us economy was beginning to show signs of 
slowing down and that was driving the dollar down 
they added however market participants were concerned over 
intervention by the bank of japan to prop up the dollar and prevent 
its further fall against the yen 
the markets sentiment appears to be inclined toward a weaker 
dollar said yoshikazu kotouge dealer at yasuda trust bank in 
tokyo but there was some buying of the dollar at around the 
12570yen level and thats keeping the dollar from falling 
rapidly 
dealers said that despite intervention by the bank of japan on a 
small scale several times monday morning the central bank was not 
able to stop the dollars decline 
on the tokyo stock exchange the nikkei was lower in early 
morning trading due to profittaking but dealers said the market 
was still bullish after gains last week 
investors took advantage of last weeks gain and as a result 
share prices opened lower said a broker at a major japanese 
securities firm speaking on condition of anonymity 
but the general sentiment of the market is still bullish 
share prices appear to have managed to turn toward profittaking 
near the end of the morning session he said 
the nikkei index topped the 28000 level at midmorning monday 
for the first time since sept19 the day emperor hirohito fell

the film ratings system which at its inception 
gave a g to dracula has risen from the grave turns 20 years 
old tuesday to mixed reviews from hollywood insiders and outsiders 
to groups denouncing what they see as a penchant by the film 
industry for sex violence and drugs the motion picture 
association of americas ratings system is inadequate 
to many filmmakers an x rating or even a familyoriented g 
means boxoffice poison and obtaining a pg13 or an r has become 
imperative the equivalent of a massmarketing seal of approval 
to gene siskel film critic for the chicago tribune the 
rrated category is now so widespread and covers so many emotions 
and physical acts that i dont know how valuable it is to parents 
but to jack valenti who has overseen the rating system for two 
decades as the associations president and chief executive officer 
the film code has achieved at least one feat 
i think just the act of surviving is itself a minor triumph 
valenti said in a recent interview 
the ratings however have gotten less than rave reviews from 
thomas e radecki chairman of the national coalition on television 
violence 
its a system designed to placate the public radecki said 
and to prevent a public rating system from coming into 
existence 
radecki conceded that the code is better than none but argued 
the ratings are why we have so much more violent and sexually 
degrading films than we did when the rating system was started 
radecki would prefer a ratings system with specific guidelines 
something like the 1934 code that prohibited passion that 
stimulates the baser emotions and lustful kissing 
he contends that rating guidelines should forbid the use of 
alcohol or drugs in pgrated movies 
but valenti who dismisses radeckis group as rightwing 
zealots said hes rejected pleas to designate a variety of 
things depicted in films as taboo including sex violence drug 
use smoking and even animal cruelty 
pretty soon we would put such baggage on this rating system it 
would collapse valenti said 
the principal guideline given board members valenti said is 
if you had to meet with the parents of wichita falls texas 
tomorrow do you believe they would find what you want to rate this 
picture to be fair and reasonable 
valenti also disputed arguments the ratings have somehow 
encouraged hollywood sex and violence he said the ratings are a 
mirror of societys values and that the association surveys 
moviegoers attitudes toward the code each year to measure its 
success 
over the last decade 65 percent to 73 percent of all 
parents with children under 13 say its very useful to fairly 
useful in helping them determine which movies their children 
see valenti said and 20 to 23 percent find it not useful at 
all 
now by political standards thats a landslide he added 
the boards nine members are neither gods nor fools valenti 
said theyre just people who like movies and theyre parents 
and theyre intelligent 
valenti hires the boards chairman and together they select the 
eight other members 
the boards costs are underwritten by a fee each filmmaker must 
pay in submitting the movie to be rated appeals are possible only 
to a 22member board comprising theater owners independent 
producers and distributors and major producers and distributors 
the first film rated by the board was dracula has risen from 
the grave which got a g rating said barbara dixon an 
association spokeswoman in washington dc 
soon midnight cowboy which starred dustin hoffman and jon 
voight was given an x but still managed to win the oscar for best 
picture of 1969 
altogether the association has rated 8460 films valenti said 
he said no more than 100 of them have created any controversy 
citing disputes over ratings assigned such films as angel 
heart cruising and 1983s scarface 
of the total ms dixon said 111 percent were grated 334 
percent were pg 34 percent were pg13 a category instituted in 
1984 478 percent were rrated and 43 percent were xrated 
ms dixon noted that pornographic filmmakers do not submit their 
films for screening and eagerly apply multiple xs to their films 
themselves

voters reelected a mayor who ran on his 
longstanding and strident opposition to having us military 
housing built in a forested oasis that is a sanctuary to birds and 
other wildlife 
but despite the return to office sunday of mayor kichiro tomino 
the national government appears determined to go ahead with the 
housing project in this city 30 miles southwest of tokyo 
the housing would relieve crowding at the nearby yokosuka naval 
base home port of the us seventh fleet 
this is a clear indication of the wishes of the residents of 
zushi tomino said in a victory speech he said he hoped the 
government would take heed of the residents wishes and reconsider 
the project 
in the hotly contested election tomino defeated physician 
tadashi ina a proponent of the construction plan by just over 
3000 votes 
backing ina was the conservative liberal democratic party which 
has governed japan for most of the postwar period 
prime minister noboru takeshita told reporters today that he 
expected tominos victory and the construction will progress 
according to the kyodo news service 
the us military has tried to keep a low profile over the 
drawnout housing controversy saying it was a matter for the 
japanese to work out 
voter turnout was reportly high after the polls opened sunday 
and when the ballots were counted this morning tomino had 17507 
votes to inas 14489 
at stake in the election was about a quarter of the ikego hills 
more than 700 acres of forest in the center of zushi a town of 
58000 in kanagawa prefecture 
the forest has gone almost untouched for half a century and is a 
sanctuary for birds and other wildlife in an otherwise densely 
populated area 
environmentalists and local housewives drew national attention 
with their campaign to defy the plan the central government 
announced six years ago to build more than 900 apartment units in 
ikego 
the location was picked because it is the former site of a 
japanese imperial navy ammunition dump in recent weeks the 
defense facilities administration agency has begun clearing trees 
at the fringes of the hills 
under a bilateral security treaty japan must supply land and 
help pay the cost of maintaining the 48000 american military 
personnel stationed nationwide due in part to the weak dollar 
private offbase housing is expensive for us personnel 
in an unsuccessful compromise proposed by kanagawa governor 
kazuji nagasu last year the number of units was reduced to 854 on 
205 acres of land 
tomino first elected in 1984 rejected the compromise and 
resigned last year to force a new election and demonstrate local 
opposition to the construction he also was reelected in that 
election 
sundays election was held because tominos original fouryear 
term had expired 
during this years campaign ina argued that tominos opposition 
to the plan had been ineffective and that it was time for zushi 
residents to look to the future and put the ikego issue behind them 
in february tomino flew to washington to plead his case but was 
turned back by us congressmen who said they were too busy to hear 
him out

fellowship analysis of the salvadoran civil war 
we cannot think that solely by military means we are going to 
resolve this war ponce said this year even if we kill all the

socioeconomic conditions would remain that it insurgency could 
easily revive

governmentrebel talks 
ponce commands the 3rd infantry brigade and belongs to the 
tandona a tightknit block of officers who have consolidated 
control of the armed forces in recent months 
blandon will leave the nation with a legacy of a larger 
military he increased its size to 50000 troops and accompanied 
president jose napoleon duarte in meetings with rebel leaders 
at the request of us military advisers blandon has increased 
use of small strike forces against guerrillas rather than sweeping 
offensives

an american woman priest celebrated communion with 
an anglican feminist group outside a chapel where their services 
were banned after receiving widespread publicity 
god is here the rev suzanne fageol of chicago said during 
the hourlong service sunday night outside st benet chapel 
her spirit is with us was the united response from nearly 
100 mainly women supporters 
ms fageol 38 was ordained in the united states where the 
episcopal church is one several provinces of the worldwide anglican 
communion to ordain women the church of englands governing 
general synod has decided to move toward ordination of women but 
there is much opposition at all levels 
ms fageol had been celebrating communion in st benet chapel at 
the request of st hildas community group since spring of 1978 
but her service on oct 23 widely reported and photographed 
led lawyers for the london diocese and fund which administers 
property for the bishop of london to warn the group it would 
consider unauthorized services in the chapel as trespassing 
bishop of london graham leonard a leading opponent of efforts 
to allow women priests in the church of england told ms fageol in 
a letter thursday i greatly deplore the use of the sacrament for 
the purposes of protest and for promoting a cause 
leonard said neither he nor archbishop of canterbury robert 
runcie the anglicans spiritual leader had authority to permit 
you as an anglican and a woman priest ordained abroad to act as a 
priest in britain where the church does not allow the ordination 
of women priests 
but on sunday night the group set up a folding table outside to 
hold the communion wine wholemeal bread rolls and candles and 
proceeded with the eucharist 
after the service ms fageol said i dont feel i am defying 
the church i dont feel i am doing anything wrong 
it isnt a deliberate act of defiance against the church its 
a deliberate giving of faith and witness and pastoral 
responsibility to a group of people who are trying to worship in a 
way they find useful spiritually she said 
ms fageol is attached to a parish church in leeds england 
while studying for a doctorate she said she intended to continue 
holding communion for the st hildas group as soon as they could 
find a new home 
the archbishop of york dr john habgood said in a service at 
york minster on saturday that the cause of womens ordination 
which he supports could be endangered by these unauthorized 
services

brightly for some time in the mind of mamie lee king whose home

threatened her own home early today she fought to hold back tears 
as firefighters doused her roof to keep the fire from spreading 
it started in a garage and spread to the two houses next to 
mine king said somebody had to have set it theres just 
no excuse for it 
firefighters saved kings house but the two other dwellings were

all over the country

going to detroit for the weekend said dave purcell a college 
park md resident but theres nothing like devils night in 
the united states 
purcell a volunteer firefighter said he and three friends flew 
to detroit for a weekend of chasing fires and taking pictures

here is the text of american hostage 
terry andersons videotaped message 
my name is terry anderson and its october 30 
once again im being given a chance to speak to my family to my 
friends and to the american people 
first to my family i love you and i miss you very much i know 
of your continued strong efforts for me the work and devotion of 
many friends and colleagues and of the many people i dont know 
like american entertainer mr hank williams 
i know i can never repay you but i thank you and pray for you 
as you do for me 
im well and being well treated i received your birthday 
greetings and as always that helped me very much 
but as my fourth birthday in captivity passes and as the end of 
my fourth year in captivity approaches i find it difficult to 
keep my hopes and my courage high 
the news i hear tells me that youve not forgotten me and i 
know you will not but the difficulty seems enormous 
ive been very close to being released several times over the 
past two years but each time it seems that the us government 
uses its influence to stop any agreement of being made and i dont 
understand this 
im not asking president reagan to deal with terrorists 
although both he and mr bush did so in the irancontra affair and 
the twa hijack 
our problem could have been solved long ago without such 
complications as arms deals 
with the palestinians in the west bank and the lebanese in 
israelirun prisons us support of israel is no different 
all that is necessary is that mr reagan and mr bush if he is 
elected use their influence in a positive way not a negative one 
with those who are trying to find a way out of this terrible 
impasse 
i gather theres been very little discussion about this problem 
in the us presidential campaign and thats disappointing as is 
president reagans complete failure to find a solution during his 
eight years in office 
but whichever candidate wins this election remember an 
unyielding refusal to deal with this matter is not going to make it 
go away it is not going to free us 
i heard on the radio of the generous and ambitious effort to 
free three trapped whales a few days ago and the presidents thanks 
to the soviet union for its help its a warming story that kind 
of cooperation and spirit is absolutely necessary to bring this 
situation to an end 
once again this has gone on too long it cant continue like 
this 
peg madeleine dad kiss my daughters for me keep your spirits 
up and i will try to do the same and one day soon god willing 
this will end

there may be an insidious media bias at work 
this election year but it isnt the publishers tilting republican 
or the networks showing an eastern establishment slant for the 
democrats no its an antiideological prejudice in favor of a 
close election 
close elections make better stories 
close elections make it seem as if the american democracy is in 
some kind of wonderful balance 
close elections are fun to cover 
close elections give journalists and politicians something to 
talk about over drinks after work 
journalists like gardeners accountants and electrical 
contractors tend to pursue their own best interests if there is 
a close race they like it to stay that way but if one candidate 
moves way ahead of another journalism can often trigger mysterious 
forces that test a frontrunners mettle or encourage the 
underdogs heroic comeback effort 
in races like those for pennsylvania or tennessee senate seats 
there is little anyone can do to boost the fortunes of anonymous 
and underfinanced challengers against popular incumbents like john 
heinz iii and james sasser 
in races for the house of representatives where 90odd percent 
of the 435 seats will be won by incumbents journalism cant even 
provide a finger for the dike 
but the presidential campaign is another matter altogether and 
the bias for a close race has been a subtle dynamic in the titanic 
struggle of george bush and michael dukakis overshadowed 
rightfully by the exertions of the candidates themselves and the 
volatility of an electorate apparently enamored so far with neither 
candidate 
today bush leads the race and the bias for a close election is 
benefiting dukakis bush would complain except that hes benefited 
from the same process and might need to again say next weekend 
for example also bush would not like to anger the other 
constituency aside from journalists who welcome a close race 
voters 
from a voters perspective 
close elections make for humble and responsive public officials 
close elections make it seem as if the american democracy is in 
some kind of wonderful balance 
close elections are fun to watch on tv the ads become 
especially entertaining even if the debates tend to wax 
insufferable 
close elections make it seem as if every voter counts even 
those on the west coast 
the roles of campaign journalism to ask tough questions 
describe the character of candidates under pressure constantly 
gauge public interest and reaction are consistent with this voter 
interest in close elections campaign coverage will often 
raise new and sharply tougher questions about the 
frontrunner this happened to bob dole during his brief stay atop 
the gop primary race he won iowa and sought a new hampshire 
knockout of george bush but bush waged a great comeback campaign 
his forces fanning reporters questions about the operation of mrs 
doles trust fund it didnt hurt that bush allies controlled the 
new hampshire gop and he began primary week with a big lead 
raise the underdogs visibility this is happening now with 
dukakis who is deluged with tv invitations and is using the 
platform to explain his values to voters who are just now tuning 
into the election process 
bush offered the same opportunities has the most to lose from 
tv exposure and so hes limiting his appearances to the morning 
talk shows if he slips in the polls hell change his strategy 
before you can say live from new york its saturday night 
write encouraging things about the dauntless dignified 
suddenly impassioned comeback kid dust off the 1948 truman 
stories explain how the electoral college math provides a glimmer 
of election day hope 
how can we tell if the presidential election is tightening 
journalists now use tracking polls to identify and publicize 
oneday trends in public opinion if those ubiquitous likely 
voters provide good news for dukakis like they did last 
thursday for example journalists and voters will be sensing a 
comeback 
we thought from the beginning bush said saturday while bus 
stopping his way through illinois wary of resisting the public 
will for a tight campaign that it would be close right up to the 
end

a doctor who said he drugged his 
cancerstricken wife so she could end her life with dignity goes on 
trial more than two years later for her murder 
dr peter rosier 47 is charged with firstdegree murder 
conspiracy to commit murder and attempted firstdegree murder his 
trial was scheduled to begin today 
this is something that is done in the medical community all 
the time said his attorney stanley rosenblatt doctors assist 
their terminally ill patients who want to die and everybody just 
winks at it 
to put him in the same category as an organized crime figure 
or someone who robs a 7eleven in the middle of the night is 
absurd 
rosenblatt said he would call doctors and mercykilling experts 
to testify for the defense 
rosier is accused of giving his 43yearold wife patricia 
rosier a 6milligram morphine injection and 80milligram morphine 
suppository on jan 5 1986 rosier says his wife also took 20 
tablets of seconal a sleeping pill which he didnt administer 
steve wisotsky a nova university law professor assisting the 
defense said the drugs the doctor gave to his wife werent enough 
to kill her 
after the drugs were administered mrs rosier lay near death 
for hours and her stepfather vincent delham finished the effort 
by suffocating her according to court records 
delham and his two sons who said they were in the room have 
been granted immunity from prosecution and are expected to be 
states witnesses 
rosier immediately opened himself to suspicion by going on fort 
myers television station wbbh in november 1986 to talk about his 
641page book the lady it was about his and his wifes lives 
and her death 
rosier a retired pathologist may have exhibited colossal 
stupidity by going public with the act but that doesnt make him 
a murderer rosenblatt said 
wisotsky said mrs rosier had a constitutional right to die with 
dignity but prosecutor ed volz has asked lee county circuit judge 
james thompson to prohibit any discussion of euthanasia and 
morality 
philosophy ethics morality will confuse the jury and they 
will not be able to reach an acceptable verdict based on the law 
volz said

a sixth fiveyear term today after capturing 95 percent of ballots 
in elections at which he was sole presidential candidate 
hundreds of supporters cheered and sang as kaunda 64 arrived 
at the high court for the ceremony

unprecedented unemployment and a foreign debt of 5 billion 
we are likely to face even more and greater problems over the 
next five years said kaunda but i am confident that we shall 
pull through 
to stay in power the zambian leader needed a simple majority of 
ballots cast by voters who were asked specifically to vote for or 
against him 
only 45 percent of those who went to polls last wednesday voted 
against him 
officials said 56 percent of 26 million registered voters took 
part 
kaunda was nominated by the united national independent party 
the countrys only legal political movement since he declared 
zambia a oneparty state in 1972 
he is expected to name his 24member cabinet on wednesday aides 
said four cabinet ministers and two ministers of state were 
rejected at the polls reflecting popular hostility toward official 
mismanagement and corruption

the united states plans to withdraw its 
first warship from the persian gulf this week a small but 
important step that reflects confidence in the iraqiran 
ceasefire us sources say 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said that 
barring a lastminute change in plans the missile frigate uss 
rodney m davis was to be detached from duty tuesday and sail for 
home port in yokosuka japan 
the 3600ton frigate would be the first us warship pulled out 
of the gulf since iraq and iran agreed to an aug 20 ceasefire in 
their eightyear war 
the ships departure would trim overall american naval strength 
in the region to 25 vessels the pentagon says the gulf force will 
gradually be scaled back to a prewar level of about five ships if 
the ceasefire stays in effect 
since the truce no flareups have been reported in the waterway 
where more than 500 commercial ships were damaged by air and 
gunboat attacks related to the war 
in washington pentagon spokesman maj mike stepp refused 
comment citing a defense department policy of not discussing ship 
movements or locations for security reasons 
us warships are regularly rotated on a sixmonth basis with 
about three months on duty in the gulf the rodney m davis arrived 
sept 9 and was to have left in january 
the fleet dropped to 26 ships when the missile cruiser uss 
vincennes left the arabian sea on sept 5 the sailing orders of 
its designated replacement the uss mobile bay were canceled a day 
before it was to leave the united states 
in other moves toward reducing the us presence officials 
ended 17 months of close escort of usflagged kuwaiti oil 
tankers curtailed regional air surveillance and took a fortified 
barge off station in the northern gulf 
the navy squadron inside the gulf normally about 16 ships 
includes six minesweepers an amphibious landing ship and the 
flagship uss la salle there are also two missile cruisers one 
missile destroyer and four frigates besides the rodney m davis 
the missile cruiser uss reeves and missile frigate uss

burma said today it will end 26 years of 
economic isolationism and a rigidly controlled domestic economy and 
open its doors to foreign investment 
there was no indication the government of gen saw maung who 
seized power sept 18 would become liberal politically 
burma will practice a marketoriented trade policy in line 
with the world economic trend both in domestic and foreign 
trade trade minister col abel told a news briefing 
abel said laws that would provide a favorable investment climate 
were being drafted and welcomed queries from both domestic and 
foreign investors on the new policies 
he said items such as teak petroleum and gems would remain 
under government monopoly but private enterprises could become 
involved in all other sectors of the economy 
he said foreign investment would be permitted either directly or 
through joint ventures with the government or local private 
enterprises 
but abel said there were no plans to change the current official 
exchange rate of six kyats to one dollar under this rate private 
exporters often receive less from their transaction than the cost 
of the export commodity the black market rate has soared to more 
than 40 kyats to the dollar recently 
burmas economy spiraled downward last year and the country 
according to experts is virtually bankrupt following months of 
political unheaval and a freeze on aid by japan west germany the 
united states and other donors 
the international community has condemned the military 
government for suppression of popular dissent which began late july 
following the retirement of ne win 
ne win who seized power in a 1962 military coup imposed a 
centrally directed economy and banned all private foreign 
investment under his authoritarian rule one of asias potentially 
richest nations became among the worlds poorest with an annual per 
capita income currently estimated at below 150 
reaction from foreign investors to the plans abel spelled out 
was expected to be cautious given the potentially chaotic 
political situation and burmas earlier backtracking on promises of 
economic reform 
since late july thousands have been killed by an authoritarian 
regime trying to maintain its power in face of nationwide protest 
saw maung has allowed the formation of political parties and 
promised a general election but opposition leaders are skeptical 
that a free and fair election can be held while the military wield 
power 
the minister said cross border trade was opened at two points 
with china recently and similar arrangements were expected to 
follow along burmas frontiers with bangladesh india and thailand 
in the past the government has lost vast revenues because it 
was unable to control smuggling across the countrys frontiers the 
border with thailand across which most commodities enter burma is 
largely controlled by ethnic minority insurgent groups fighting the 
central government

more than half of the longterm workers at the 
fernald uranium processing plant say theyve been exposed to 
uranium frequently over the years a newspaper reported 
the cincinnati enquirer reported sunday that a federal study 
found a close relationship between workers reports of exposure to 
uranium and medical problems including shortness of breath 
the report was the latest in a series of revelations of problems 
at the feed materials production center near fernald a small town 
north of cincinnati and at other federal nuclear weapons plants 
the plant owned by the us department of energy processes 
uranium for weapons 
the study was requested by one of the unions that represent 
fernald workers it was performed by the national institute for 
occupational safety and health in cincinnati 
the enquirer said an interim report dated july 1987 found that 
some workers were so severely affected that they could not walk 
short distances without stopping for breath 
the study was limited to workers who had been employed at the 
fernald plant for more than 10 years of the 208 such employees 
146 agreed to participate in the study they had worked at the

even after accounting for cigarette smoking 32 percent of the 
workers had shortness of breath the study found including nine 
workers who could not walk more than 100 yards without stopping to 
breathe heavily onefourth of the workers had restricted or 
obstructed lung functions 
the study was requested by the international association of 
machinists which represents 625 of the plants 1500 fulltime 
workers the plants unions are on strike citing safety and health 
concerns as well as wage and benefit disagreements production at 
the plant has been stopped since oct 7 
david day president of fernalds machinists local said the 
niosh report is being reviewed by the unions 
its difficult to know who to trust day said right now 
we do trust niosh 
dr mitchell singal of niosh who prepared the study said the 
federal institute is still researching the working environment at 
the plant but has closed its investigation into medical effects on 
workers 
there were some additional analyses done after the interim 
study was completed in 1987 but those analyses didnt change the 
initial conclusions singal told the enquirer 
james reafsnyder energy department site representative at 
fernald said over the weekend that he was not familiar with the 
study results

in july 1984 a wealthy matron and her 
daughter were shot to death at their sprawling home northeast of 
louisville in may 1985 three members of a welltodo 
winstonsalem nc family were found slain 
two sets of killings months and miles apart but tied together 
by a tale of failed marriage an incestuous relationship and a 
bitter child custody battle when authorities finally caught up 
with the suspects they committed suicide in a car explosion after 
killing the two boys at the center of the custody dispute 
the story was apparent to investigators in retrospect according 
to a new book it could have become apparent much sooner before 
the second set of killings but for the mistakes of north carolina 
authorities 
bitter blood by greensboro nc news amp record reporter 
jerry bledsoe looks at the slayings of delores rodgers lynch 68 
and her daughter dr jane lynch 39 of prospect ky and the 
aftermath 
mrs lynch also had a son thomas j lynch a dentist in 
albuquerque nm he had been married from 1970 to 1981 to north 
carolina native susie newsom 
as part of his investigation into the lynches slayings dan 
davidson then an investigator for the kentucky state police 
requested a check on susie lynch from the north carolina state 
bureau of investigation the check showed that a camping trailer 
was jointly registered to her and a frederick klenner 32 
davidson then sought a check on klenner and was told that he was 
a doctor with no criminal record 
an apparent dead end 
but klenner who was susie lynchs first cousin was not what he 
appeared to be despite a widespread belief among people in his 
hometown of reidsville nc that he was a physician he had never 
attended medical school at least one person knew that and had 
complained to authorities who compiled a detailed file on him 
according to the book 
in the file a state bureau of investigation agent described 
klenner as a survivalist gun nut according to the file 
klenner was paranoid and spent all of his money on exotic 
military weapons that he carried wherever he went 
had davidson been given this file by north carolina authorities 
he would have focused on klenner immediately according to bitter 
blood davidson agrees 
north carolina sbi officials refused to talk to bledsoe for his 
book and the bureau in raleigh recently declined to comment to the 
associated press 
after the lynch killings 10 months of fruitless investigation 
passed then on may 18 1985 susie lynchs parents robert w 
newsom jr and florence sharp newsom and her grandmother hattie 
c newsom were shot dead 
with the second set of slayings the family tie became clear 
all five victims apparently upset by klenners courtship of susie 
lynch had planned to testify against her at a hearing that summer 
over the custody of her sons both families were wealthy and a 
desire for the inheritances may have played a role as well 
investigators said at the time 
but the real motive will never be known by early june 
authorities had decided to arrest klenner on murder charges in the 
newsom family slayings because he was planning to leave the state 
and had threatened witnesses they said 
on june 4 they caught up with his van and began a chase with 
klenner was susie lynch and the two boys as police closed in the 
van exploded klenner and his lover were killed by the explosion 
authorities discovered that the boys ages 8 and 10 already had 
been killed poisoned with cyanide and shot in the head 
davidson said klenner had to have detonated the bomb and 
authorities believe susie lynch knew of all the slayings and died 
willingly as well 
after the explosion davidson and his investigators returned to 
kentucky to finish their investigation of the oldham county 
killings 
davidson got phone records that led him to the gun store in 
winstonsalem where klenner did most of his trading he found that 
klenner had traded a rifle the same type of weapon used to kill 
the lynches to that dealer the day after the killings ballistics 
tests linked a bullet found at the lynch home to the gun 
three months after the explosion an oldham county grand jury 
found that klenner and susie lynch were responsible for the lynch 
killings 
i wanted to be able to tell the people that there wasnt a 
killer in their midst and i wanted to be sure about what i was 
telling them davidson said

a sea lion apparently suffering from a 
liver and kidney disease attacked a swimmer and a beach stroller 
over the weekend prompting authorities to issue their firstever 
sea lion warning 
weve never even heard of something like that where a sea 
lion would actually attack somebody swimming said mary jane 
schramm director of public relations for the marine mammal center 
in the water the animal typically feels it has nothing to fear 
from a human 
the center warned swimmers plying the chilly waters of san 
francisco bay to avoid all sea lions 
a swimmer was bitten off aquatic park in san francisco on 
saturday the sea lion just swam up to the poor guy and 
gratuitously bit him on the side of the chest and on the foot 
schramm said 
the unidentified swimmer was admitted to a hospital and received 
the normal animalbite treatment schramm said 
the same day the sea lion attacked a woman who was walking on 
the beach off crissy field a few miles from where the swimmer was 
attacked schramm said the woman thought the animal was sick and 
wanted to help 
she meant well but she got bit because she placed herself 
right between the animal and where he wanted to go the beach 
she said 
the sea lion which weighs between 60 and 80 pounds has two red 
tags on its flippers meaning it was born near the channel islands 
off santa barbara 
schramm speculated that the sea lion was suffering from a 
disease called leptospirosis an often fatal sickness of the liver 
and kidney 
three rescue teams searched for the sea lion over the weeked but

parliamentary elections it could drive undecided voters to the 
likud bloc of prime minister yitzhak shamir who has advocated a 
hard line in dealing with violence 
in newspaper interviews published today shamir and his rival 
foreign minister shimon peres promised revenge for sundays attack 
defense minister yitzhak rabin asked the armys chief prosecutor 
to investigate whether the death penalty could be used against the 
assailants calling them murderers of women and children who have 
lost all shades of humanity israel radio reported 
the radio said the army rounded up dozens of palestinians in 
jericho it said two suspects in custody admitted taking part in 
the attack 
in jerusalem today more than 1000 mourners attended a funeral 
for the victim 27yearold rachel weiss and her sons rafael 
netanel and efraim aged 9 months to 3 years many mourners wept 
and wore the traditional black clothes of orthodox jews a banner 
stetched across the street said oh what has befallen us 
mrs weiss her husband and her sons lived in jerusalem and were 
returning home from northern israel at the time of the attack on 
the bus the husband escaped without serious injury army officials 
said 
five other bus passengers were injured in the attac one a 
soldier who was seriously burned 
two of those injured are immigrants from pittsburgh dov blum 
35 who suffered serious burns on his face and his wife cindy 
burned on her face and back said ruth mekel of hadassah hospital 
in jerusalem 
the attack claimed the largest number of israeli lives in a 
single assault since the palestinian revolt against israels 
21year occupation of the west bank and gaza strip broke out almost 
11 months ago 
a total of 305 palestinians and 10 israelis have been killed in 
the uprising which began dec 8 
maj gen amram mitzna the west bank commander told reporters 
in jericho today that a curfew was imposed on the town of about 
17000 arabs 18 miles east of jerusalem 
the attackers tossed the firebombs from a banana plantation next 
to the road as reporters watched today an army bulldozer plowed 
under rows of banana trees to prevent future ambushes 
soldiers some using police dogs searched door to door 
officers said the attack was meticulously planned but mitzna 
played down a connection with the elections the timing is just 
two days before the election but it is not the first time that 
firebombs were thrown on west bank roads 
in the past two months there have been more than 100 firebomb 
attacks in the jericho area israel radio said 
mitzna said firebombs were hurled at the bus by palestinians at 
about 815 pm one broke through a window setting afire the back 
seat where the children were sitting 
two or three molotov cocktails were thrown at the bus which 
went up in flames in seconds mitzna said 
the driver slammed on the brakes and most of the 22 passengers 
scrambled to safety a soldier identified only as sgt ron 
boarded the redandwhite egged bus no 961 and found a woman still 
aboard 
from the back of the bus i heard the sound of a trapped 
woman ron said on israel radio i grabbed her with one hand i 
said come out with me she absolutely refused 
she screamed but i have a baby what about the baby after 
a few seconds i realized that if i remained one more second i 
would be killed 
capt avi who arrived moments after the bus caught fire told 
reporters the woman apparently panicked and feared leaving the bus 
because she thought terrorists were outside 
reporters were kept away from the scene until dawn and the bus 
was gone by the time photographers arrived however one witness 
said the bus was consumed by fire its tires melted into the 
asphalt 
speaking on israel radio shamir said he did not think the 
attack was linked to the elections saying there was no logic to 
such acts of hatred 
i am sure the security forces will reach the murderers he 
said i hope the murderers and those who sent them and their 
supporters will feel the serious consequences to them and their 
surroundings of their heinous hatred towards us 
but industry minister ariel sharon at an election rally in 
southern israel accused israeli liberals of creating an atmosphere 
for such attacks by saying all talk of withdrawal or pullbacks 
brings more and more firebomb attacks newspapers reported 
shamir was quoted as telling the hadashot daily this 
despicable act in jericho deserves an appropriate response that 
will prove to the murderers they will be punished to the full 
extent of the law 
peres was quoted by the national news agency itim as saying 
israel was united into one family by such attacks 
neither terrorism nor violence will determine our path we 
will determine our path he said deeds such as tonights tear 
at the heart and provide nothing in the way of hope for a 
solution

the supreme court today killed a lawsuit 
against the government stemming from the world war ii mass 
detention of japaneseamericans in us prison camps 
the court without comment left intact rulings that the 
veterans of the internment camps waited too long to file suit 
seeking compensation for property losses 
congress and the reagan administration this year officially 
acknowledged that the japaneseamericans were treated unjustly 
president reagan signed legislation on aug 10 that provides a 
20000 taxfree payment to each of some 60000 survivors among the 
120000 us citizens and resident aliens of japanese ancestry who 
were placed in the camps 
noting that the detainees were forced to leave their homes and 
placed in concentration camps for up to four years reagan said the 
reparations had less to do with property than with honor 
the bill calls for a 12 billion fund with appropriations in 
any one year to be no more than 500 million 
but the new law did not make the case acted on today by the 
supreme court a dead issue the legislation allowed anyone who does 
not seek reparations from the fund to pursue the lawsuit 
the reagan administration opposed the suit on grounds the 
statute of limitations or deadline for filing such court claims 
has long since passed 
the detainees argued the deadline should be suspended because 
the governments deception in concealing the real reason for the 
internment racism rather than military necessity was not 
exposed until decades after the war ended they said the supreme 
court itself was deceived in 1944 when it upheld the internment 
program 
the administration said the high court was not hoodwinked 
justice department lawyers said the government based the internment 
policy on its belief that ancestral cultural and ethnic 
considerations made it likely those of japanese ancestry would 
engage in subversive activity 
in the wake of the japanese attack on pearl harbor in 1941 the 
government forcibly removed from their homes those of japanese 
ancestry living in california oregon washington state and arizona 
president franklin d roosevelt authorized the internment 
acting on advice by military leaders that people of japanese 
descent could not be trusted 
the supreme courts 1944 ruling upheld the internment program as 
a constitutionally acceptable military necessity 
by the mid1970s government documents were discovered that 
indicated there was no such military necessity 
then 19 survivors and descendants of those interned filed suit 
in 1983 in behalf of all 120000 
the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia 
ruled in 1986 that the government must defend itself at trial 
against the suit 
but the supreme court in june 1987 said the appeals court did 
not have authority over the case and sent it instead to a different 
court the us court of appeals for the federal circuit that 
appeals court in a 21 ruling last may said the suit was barred 
by the statute of limitations 
the deadline question had not been addressed by the supreme 
court when the justices issued their ruling last year 
the case is hohri vs us 88215

sunday night after neighbors had repeatedly called police to report

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether states must continue to provide lawyers for indigent death 
row inmates after they have lost their initial round of appeals 
the court said it will hear an appeal by virginia officials who 
said requiring states to pay for attorneys in such cases could lead 
to interminable delays in carrying out executions 
the justices are expected to announce their decision in 1989 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals in a 64 ruling last 
june said condemned murderers in virginia who cannot afford a 
lawyer are entitled to greater representation at taxpayer expense 
than the state provides 
attorneys are provided by the state when a death row inmate 
files an initial appeal in state courts 
convicted killers who lose that round may pursue a second round 
of appeals in state courts contending that their rights were 
violated but they are not entitled to free legal representation 
during this second phase if they are unable to afford their own 
lawyer 
like other states virginia provides prison law libraries and 
assigns parttime lawyers to help inmates prepare their 
secondround or collateral appeals in some cases volunteer 
lawyers are available to help the prisoners 
but the 4th circuit court said the constitution requires more in 
the case of those on death row 
the complexity and difficulty of the legal work involved in 
challenging a death penalty require particular safeguards in order 
to insure meaningful access to justice the appeals court said 
the appeals court also noted that inmates facing execution are 
likely to be emotionally incapable of preparing a cogent appeal 
but the appeals court said death row inmates are not entitled to 
free legal help for a third round of appeals when they take their 
cases to federal court to claim their rights were violated 
by the time the case reaches the federal courts the appeals 
court said the inmates will have legal briefs trial transcripts 
and state court opinions from earlier state court appeals that will 
enable them to prepare their own defense effectively 
virginia officials said the 4th circuit court ruling injects a 
palpable danger of infinite delay in resolving capital cases 
the added guarantee of free legal representation will give death 
row inmates another opportunity to contend that they received 
ineffective assistance from their lawyers the officials said that 
could lead to another protracted round of appeals they continued 
the officials also said that most states with capital punishment 
do not guarantee free legal help beyond the first round of appeals 
the state attorney generals office interpreted a 1987 supreme 
court ruling to mean that the constitution does not guarantee a 
right to a lawyer in collateral appeals 
in the 1987 case the justices ruled that a pennsylvania womans 
constitutional right to adequate legal help had not been violated 
during an earlier appeal she claimed she was denied effective 
representation when her courtappointed lawyer concluded that her 
collateral appeal was fruitless 
the 4th circuit court said the 1987 ruling did not answer the 
constitutional question raised in the virginia case particularly 
since the pennsylvania case did not involve the death penalty 
the case is murray vs giarratano 88411

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that a state may ban the possession of child pornography 
the court citing a lack of jurisdiction rejected an appeal by 
an illinois couple who say state officials are intruding into the 
privacy of the home to impose censorship 
justices william j brennan thurgood marshall and john paul 
stevens voted to hear arguments in the case one vote shy of the 
four needed to grant such review 
the couple john and charlene geever of bartlett ill are 
awaiting trial on a 19count indictment handed up by a state grand 
jury in 1985 
while the geevers also were accused of soliciting a child to 
appear in a pornographic video and taking indecent liberties with a 
child 12 of the counts deal solely with possession of pornographic 
material 
the state law provides a penalty of up to three years in prison 
and a 25000 fine for possession of child pornography 
the illinois supreme court ruled in march that outlawing 
possession of sexually explicit and lewd material depicting 
children under 18 does not violate the constitution 
the purpose of the statute is not to limit the indviduals 
freedom of thought and mind in his own home nor is its purpose to 
regulate the moral content of the depictions described the state 
court said the purpose is to prevent the sexual abuse and 
exploitation of children by drying up the market for child 
pornography 
the state court said state officials have a compelling interest 
in protecting children from the lasting harm of emotional and 
sexual degradation 
at least 11 other states have made it a crime to possess child 
pornography they are alabama arizona florida minnesota nevada 
ohio oklahoma south dakota texas utah and washington 
the us supreme court ruled in 1969 that states may not forbid 
the mere possession of obscene material the justices based that 
ruling on constitutional guarantees of free expression and on the 
right to be free except in very limited circumstances from 
unwanted governmental intrusions into ones privacy 
the high court also has held in 1982 that states may ban the 
sale and dissemination of child pornography even if the material 
is not legally obscene 
that ruling said fighting sexual exploitation of children is a 
government objective of surpassing importance 
since 1973 the court has defined materials as obscene and 
therefore unprotected by constitutionally guaranteed freedoms if 
they appeal to the prurient interest in sex portray sexual 
conduct in a patently offensive way or when taken as a whole do 
not have serious literary artistic political or scientific 
value 
the 1982 decision held that material depicting sexual activity 
by children does not have to meet that standard to be subject to 
criminal laws against distribution 
the case is geever vs illinois 88381

an afghan guerrilla leader today 
announced plans to form an allrebel government in afghanistan and 
said he hoped elections could be held by january 
burhanuddin rabbani chairman of the sevenmember guerrilla 
alliance outlined a plan under which afghans inside afghanistan 
and refugees outside the country would elect a 400member 
parliament 
the parliament would elect a head of state and approve a 
cabinet rabbani said 
the pakistanbased guerrillas or mujahedeen announced similar 
plans in the spring but they didnt materialize reportedly 
because of guerrilla infighting 
as the mujahedeen have been successful on the battlefield we 
can also be successful in the peace process he told reporters in 
the pakistani capital 
rabbani said the seven leaders of the guerrilla alliance 
unanimously adopted the plan 
rabbani said he and representatives of the six other guerrilla 
groups were leaving for new york later to attend talks at the 
united nations on the war the un general assembly takes up the 
afghanistan issue this week 
afghan president najib called for an emergency meeting of the 
un security council to discuss the afghan war especially 
allegations that pakistan is violating an accord by allowing 
guerrillas to receive us aid through pakistani territory 
the unmediated accord calls for the soviet union to withdraw 
its troops from afghanistan by feb 15 it was signed in april in 
geneva 
the red army intervened in the afghan conflict in december 1979 
to replace one marxist government with another it remained to help 
the government fight the guerrillas 
although the agreement includes a pledge by islamabad and 
washington not to interfere in afghanistans internal affairs the 
united states and soviet union also agreed to continue arming their 
respective clients in the war until the other side stops 
rabbani his call for direct talks with moscow we remind the 
russians that if they want peace they must recognize the reality 
that the only solution is direct talks with the mujahedeen he

the supreme court for the second time in six 
months today refused to disturb a ban on sexually explicit 
telephone dialup message services dubbed dialaporn 
the justices without comment rejected arguments that such bans 
violate freespeech rights 
todays action in a case from new york city sets no national 
precedent and challenges to a new federal law banning all 
dialaporn services are expected to reach the high court soon 
such services have been available to callers through 976 numbers 
and atampts 900 longdistance lines 
the 976 and 900 exchanges also are used for other 
noncontroversial types of messages such as sports scores time 
checks and stock market and weather reports 
in the appeal acted on today a group of dialaporn companies 
challenged an older less restrictive version of the federal law 
that banned making any obscene or indecent communication by means 
of a telephone for commercial purposes to any person under 18 years 
of age 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals last january upheld the 
federal law as it applies to obscene material but the appeals 
court said the law cannot be enforced against merely sexually 
explicit material not deemed to be legally obscene 
a federal trial judge in los angeles issued a similar decision 
last july 19 when ruling on a challenge to a dialaporn law 
enacted by congress and signed by president reagan on july 1 
us district judge a wallace tashima ruled that the new law 
may be applied to obscene material but not to merely indecent 
material 
the new law bans all dialaporn services offered to adults as 
well as to children 
american civil liberties union lawyers say the law is 
unconstitutional they support providing means of having the 
services available only to those who want them 
the reagan administration appealed tashimas ruling that 
portion blocking the laws enforcement against indecent but not 
obscene telephone messages directly to the supreme court the 
appeal is pending before the justices 
the court last april let stand a ban on dialaporn message 
service in arizona 
in the new york case acted on today lawyers for various 
dialaporn companies argued among other things that the 
sinceupdated federal law creates an impermissible national 
standard of obscenity 
they said past supreme court decisions on obscenity require that 
determinations of obscenity must be made according to local 
community standards 
the case is carlin communications vs fcc 8837

and her architect husband have divorced by mutual consent a court 
official said today 
the official requesting anonymity in accordance with greek 
practice said the divorce would become final within one week 
when the papers are processed 
dimitra liani a 34yearold olympic airways flight attendant 
married alex kapopoulos 48 a former prominent member of the 
revolutionary greek communist party in a civil ceremony in 1982 
the couple have no children 
they parted after working together on a 1986 television series

the supreme court today refused to overturn a 
75000 libel award to a virgin islands bar and restaurant that had 
the same name as a bar featured in an adult magazines erotic 
fiction 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by high society 
magazines publishers who said they were unaware the restaurant in 
the article entitled savage lust bore any resemblance to a real 
business establishment 
high society was sued by s amp h management corp and its 
president jaber samad owner of a restaurant called the carousel 
on st thomas in the virgin islands 
high society is published by drake publishers inc 
savage lust which appeared in the december 1981 issue of 
the magazine was a fictional account of a st thomas bar also 
called the carousel the article described the bar as a sailors 
dive frequented by prostitutes and a symbol of tropical 
decadence and moral decay 
the story described how a female customer was drugged kidnapped 
and sexually assaulted by the owner 
us district judge almeric l christian ruled that the article 
hurt the real carousels reputation and would deter a desirable 
clientele from patronizing the bar 
gloria leonard publisher of high society testified she was 
unaware there was a real bar on st thomas called the carousel 
but christian concluded she knew of the bars existence since 
she had been a frequent visitor to st thomas and could recall the 
names of businesses located on either side of the carousel 
the judge said samad had proven that the article referred to his 
bar 
the fact that fiction purports not to concern real persons or 
events is of no consequence in determining the merits of a 
defamation action christian said 
the judge added that the magazine was guilty of actual 
malice by acting with reckless disregard as to the truth or 
falsity of the events described in the article 
but christian said the magazine still could be forced to pay the 
libel award even if it was guilty only of negligence 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals last april upheld the 
libel award in a onepage order 
drake publishers said the appeals court thus failed to examine 
the case carefully as required by a 1984 supreme court libel ruling 
the appeals court has wrapped its decisionmaking and review 
process in a cloak of silence the company said drakes right 
under the first amendment to an independent appellate examination 
of the whole record cannot be so lightly or easily sidestepped 
the case is drake publishers vs samad 88369

the supreme court declining to further expand 
its study of drug testing in the workplace today rejected an 
appeal by justice department employees who say such tests would 
violate their rights 
the court without comment refused to intercede in the case 
which has yet to be argued before a lower court 
the random drugtesting program for the justice department stems 
from an executive order by president reagan in 1986 that authorizes 
heads of federal agencies to conduct tests for those in sensitive 
positions 
the drugfree workplace plan adopted by former attorney 
general edwin meese applies to numerous department employees 
including anyone with access to top secret information highlevel 
appointees and attorneys and their assistants who conduct grand 
jury investigations 
the program was challenged by 38 attorneys three paralegals and 
one economist 
they said requiring them to submit to random urine tests when 
there is no reason to suspect them of drug use violates their 
constitutional privacy rights 
a federal judge blocked the tests pending further court action 
the us circuit court of appeals here scheduled arguments in the 
case for dec 15 
but the department employees saying they faced an 
unprecedented frontal assault on personal privacy and bodily 
integrity appealed directly to the supreme court to decide the 
case without waiting for a lower court opinion 
hundreds of thousands of federal employees should not be left 
at risk of losing either their livelihood or their constitutional 
rights while awaiting resolution of the case they said 
they said those who refuse to urinate under surveillance and 
submit their urine to the governments fishing expedition for 
evidence of drug use would be fired unlawfully 
solicitor general charles fried the reagan administrations top 
courtroom lawyer who would be subject himself to the drug tests 
asked the high court to reject the appeal 
the regular judicial process should be allowed to run its 
course and the supreme court should keep hands off until the 
appeals court here reviews the case he said 
the justices previously agreed to examine drug tests in three 
cases to be decided by next july 
they will determine whether a railroad company may routinely 
test its workers whether the federal government may require the 
tests for railroad workers who have been involved in serious train 
accidents and whether the us customs service may test those 
seeking jobs related to drug enforcement 
the justice department employees said the tests planned for that 
agency are similar to those planned for hundreds of thousands of 
federal workers the reagan administration has said that 345000 
federal employees are designated for random tests under reagans 
1986 order 
the case is harmon vs thornburgh 88427

the supreme court today refused to allow the 
sale of tshirts and other items parodying nuclear war with a 
design resembling an insurance companys trademark 
the court let stand a ruling that the design illegally 
infringes on the trademark of mutual of omaha insurance co 
justice byron r white voted to hear arguments in the case but 
the votes of at least four justices are required to grant such 
review 
mutual of omaha sued franklyn novak who was living in omaha 
neb when in 1983 he got the idea for the design 
he said he used mutual of omahas logo as inspiration for his 
design showing the emaciated profile of a face wearing an indian 
bonnet of burned or charred feathers with x in place of an eye 
alongside the indian head was the inscription mutant of omaha 
nuclear holocaust insurance 
the mutual of omaha insignia is an indian head with the 
companys name alongside 
novak sold about 4000 tshirts bearing his logo design on the 
front and on the back the message when the worlds in ashes 
well have you covered 
novak also placed the design on sweatshirts caps buttons and 
coffee mugs 
a federal judge ruled that novaks use of the design could 
confuse people into believing that mutual of omaha was affiliated 
with the merchandise the judge barred him from advertising or 
marketing the items 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals in december 1987 upheld 
the injunction 
the appeals court rejected novaks argument that his design is a 
legitimate exercise of freespeech rights 
the protection afforded by the first amendment does not give 
novak license to infringe the rights of mutual the appeals court 
said given the circumstances of this case mutuals property 
rights should not yield 
the appeals court said the injunction is not a blanket ban on 
novaks right of free expression it doesnt restrain him from 
engaging in editorial parody in a book magazine or film the 
appeals court said 
the case is novak vs mutual of omaha 871908

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by 
kansas prosecutors challenging state laws that broadly justify 
using deadly force to defend someones home or personal property 
the justices without comment let stand kansas laws that permit 
use of deadly force even by people not threatened with death or 
great bodily harm 
the controversy arose when lloyd d clothier was charged with 
involuntary manslaughter for fatally shooting a 15yearold boy at 
his wichita home nov 23 1986 
trial testimony established that clothier was awakened in the 
predawn hours that day by his dogs barking and growling 
taking a loaded revolver from his nightstand clothier looked 
out a window and saw someone in his driveway reaching into 
clothiers van clothier said he was worried that the intruder 
would find his garage door opener in the van and use it to gain 
access into his home 
clothier testified that he fired a warning shot and saw someone 
run behind the van and across the yard he testified that he fired 
another warning shot at the ground before stepping outside the 
house 
one of the bullets hit seanan picard in the head the youth who 
was unarmed died a short time later 
sedgwick county prosecutors charged clothier with involuntary 
manslaughter in the shooting but a jury acquitted him after being 
read what kansas law says about the defense of a dwelling and 
personal property 
one law says a person is justified in the use of force he 
reasonably believes is necessary to prevent or terminate such 
others unlawful entry into or attack upon his dwelling 
another law says a person may defend against the theft of his 
possessions with the degree of force or threat thereof as a 
reasonable man would deem necessary to prevent or terminate the 
interferenc 
in the appeal acted on today kansas prosecutors urged the 
justices to change laws which give greater deference to property 
than to human life by striking down the kansas statutes which allow 
this inequity 
the appeal noted that there is no definitive universal 
solution on the issue of using deadly force to defend ones home 
and property 
the prosecutors said for example that texas law justifies one 
persons killing another to protect land or property they said the 
texas law goes so far as to permit the use of deadly force to 
prevent one from fleeing with property even though the escapee is 
no longer a threat to the defender 
conversely the appeal said many states have laws holding 
that the use of deadly force which results in the taking of human 
life merely to defend any property is never reasonable 
the appeal argued it is absurd that a person who guns down a 
15yearold boy for tampering with his vehicle may be held to 
answer for his use of excessive force in one state but may shoot 
with impunity in another 
the kansas supreme court rejected the prosecutors arguments 
last april 29 saying their appeal presents essentially a quarrel 
with the legislative wisdom of deciding to grant the defenses set 
forth under the state laws 
the case is kansas vs clothier 88168

the supreme court today left intact a ruling 
that a judge may not fire public defenders because of their 
political affiliation 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by an indiana 
judge ordered to pay 61075 to two assistant public defenders who 
sued the judge for violating their rights 
the political patronage case stems from the appointment of james 
j krajewski to be a lake county court judge in 1985 he was named 
to replace orval anderson who was indicted on federal perjury 
charges 
nearly a year after he was appointed krajewski a republican 
fired assistant public defenders stephen a kurowski and david h 
nicholls both democrats 
krajewski said he dismissed the public defenders in a general 
housecleaning of the office kurowski and nicholls had served 
under the previous chief public defender who had been convicted of 
criminal misconduct along with anderson 
but kurowski and nicholls said the real reason they were fired 
was because they were democrats and krajewski wanted to name 
republicans to replace them 
a federal magistrate awarded damages to the public defenders 
and that ruling was upheld last june by the 7th us circuit court 
of appeals 
the appeals court said the evidence was clear that the two men 
were fired because of their political affiliation 
the appeals court also rejected krajewskis arguments that he 
had the proper authority to dismiss the public defenders for 
political reasons 
citing a 1980 supreme court ruling the appeals court said a 
judge may not fire assistant public defenders on political grounds 
the 1980 high court ruling held that a chief public defender may 
not fire his assistants because of their political affiliation 
the 7th circuit court said that ruling turned on the 
characteristics of the assistant public defenders job not on the 
office of the person doing the firing 
the appeals court rejected krajewskis claim that assistant 
public defenders in indiana hold policymaking jobs and 
therefore can be fired for political affiliation because public 
defenders are eligible to serve as temporary county court judges 
the appeals court said that argument does not hold up because 
any lawyer in the state not just a public defender can be 
picked by a judge to fill in on the bench in the judges absence 
judicial service is not part of the public defenders office 
the appeals court said public defenders represent criminal 
defendants and their loyalty as advocates runs to their clients 
not to their employer the appeals court said 
krajewski was ordered to pay 59075 in compensatory damages and 
2000 in punitive damages to kurowski and nicholls who also were 
ordered reinstated in the public defender jobs they also were 
awarded 13905 in reimbursement for their attorneys fees 
the case is krajewski vs kurowski 88391

the supreme court today asked the reagan 
administration for advice on whether the justices should kill a 
lawsuit growing out of the development of an aeromedical center in 
kaduna nigeria 
the court asked the justice department to give its views on a 
decision requiring ws kirkpatrick amp co a new jersey 
corporation to defend itself against allegations that it won the 
contract by illegally bribing nigerian government officials 
those allegations are raised in a suit filed by environmental 
tectonics corp of pennsylvania 
a justice department investigation of the 1981 contract between 
kirkpatrick and the nigerian government led to kirkpatricks 
pleading guilty to one count of violating the foreign corrupt 
practices act 
kirkpatrick was fined 75000 
environmental tectonics which had submitted a lower bid for the 
nigerian contract then sued kirkpatrick its lawsuit alleged that 
environmental tectonics would have been awarded the contract but 
for kirkpatricks payment of bribes 
a federal judge dismissed the suit relying on the socalled 
act of state doctrine it precludes us courts from inquiring 
into the validity of a foreign governments acts committed within 
its own territory 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals however reinstated the 
suit last may 2 the traditional justification for invoking the 
doctrine avoiding a judicial determination of the legal validity 
of a states act within its own borders is not present in this 
case the appeals court said 
kirkpatrick then sought the supreme courts help 
the case is kirkpatrick amp co vs environmental tectonics corp

more than 6000 taxis ringed downtown 
athens today and cabdrivers demonstrated outside the transport 
ministry to protest antipollution measures that restrict their 
access to the city 
half of athens 800000 cars including 25000 taxis are 
banned from a fivesquaremile zone around the city center between 
7 am and 3 pm on weekdays under the ban introduced in 
january vehicles with license plates ending in an even number 
alternate with those bearing an oddnumbered last digit 
the drivers fiercely object to the ban because they say 50 
percent of their fares are generated in the restricted zone 
todays protest which caused a traffic jam in the center 
followed a monthlong boycott of the restricted area by cabdrivers 
its ridiculous to say that were solely to blame for athens 
pollution if the government really wants to solve the problem 
it should improve the quality of diesel gas and not restrict our 
movements in the city center said taxi driver emmanuel loukas 
35 
environmental control authorities say that exhaust fumes from 
dieselfueled taxis aging buses and private cars are responsible 
for the high levels of atmospheric pollution in the capital but 
taxi drivers claim they cause less than 7 percent of the pollution 
thats not enough for the government to expect us to send our 
cars to the junk yard and buy others that run on leadfree 
petrol said driver panayiotis liakos 
most athens taxis run on diesel fuel but more than 100 of them 
have recently converted to unleaded gasoline in a bid to bypass the 
ban the government has said that all cabs running on unleaded 
gasoline would be able to move freely in the restricted zone 
but the drivers who earn an average takehome salary of about 
400 a month say they cannot afford to make the change 
how can the government honestly expect us to go out and buy 
new cars none of us have the capital to do that said 
cabdriver konstantinos stefanides 
a gallon of unleaded gasoline costs about 240 compared to 
about 100 for diesel fuel 
if our cars were to run on unleaded fuel we would have to 
raise our fares substantively said stefanides it would be the 
end of some of the cheapest taxis in the world 
a taxi ride from athens international airport to the city costs

the supreme court today allowed alaska 
officials to enforce a state law requiring groups of two or more 
people to report political campaign contributions 
the court citing a lack of a substantial federal question 
rejected an appeal by an oil field service company fined 72600 
for not reporting paycheck withholding of 100 per worker and 
payment of the money to legislative candidates 
the company veco international inc collected 41080 in 
campaign contributions by middecember 1983 the money generally 
went to candidates picked by an oil and gas industry political 
action committee 
veco encouraged its employees to allow 100 to be withheld for 
donations the workers could choose not to contribute or could 
earmark the money for specific candidates 
the company was told by a state official in august 1983 that it 
would not have to register the withholding plan with the state or 
report the contributions 
but the alaska public offices commission that supervises the 
campaign reporting law later wrote to veco indicating the company 
was not exempt from the act 
the alaska supreme court last april upheld the fine against 
veco the state court said the contributions were provided by a 
group and not separate individuals since the company has a 
significant role in candidate selection 
the state court also rejected arguments that the law is too 
broad because it imposes disclosure requirements on small groups 
that spend minor sums of money supporting candidates 
there is a level of joint political activity below which the 
government has no legitimate interest in regulating the state 
court said 
but the state court said vecos plan was above that level and 
there was no danger of chilling political activity by interpreting 
the law to apply to the plan 
veco furnished substantial support to candidates in the 1984 
election the state court said the public was not informed of 
this support and to that extent the statutory purpose was 
frustrated 
the case is veco vs alaska public offices commission 88177

soviet claims against the united states for 
construction delays on its washington embassy exceed the 29 
million the united states wants for its unfinished embassy in 
moscow an official said today 
we also have bills to present to the american side soviet 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told a news 
conference 
claims for late delivery of equipment and construction materials 
and other problems would top the sum us officials are seeking 
from the soviet union he said 
president reagan said thursday that he was recommending the main 
office building of the new us embassy compound in moscow be torn 
down because it is riddled with soviet bugging devices 
the united states is not allowing the soviet union to occupy its 
new building in washington until the americans are satisfied with 
the status of their moscow building 
the us claim is for damage and defective construction no 
figure has been established for a claim against the soviet union 
for bugging the building us state department spokesman phyllis 
oakley said 
soviet officials deny the building is bugged and say the united 
states has provided no proof 
gerasimov told reporters last week that the united states is 
free to do what it wants with its embassy in moscow but that there 
was a certain antisoviet aftertaste in reagans decision 
the united states and soviet union have held direct talks on 
their claims and us officials said last week they would ask 
outside arbiters to settle the dispute

the supreme court today killed a challenge to 
a nebraska policy prohibiting facilities offering 24hour care for 
children from using corporal punishment 
the justices citing a lack of a substantial federal question 
let stand a nebraska supreme court decision dismissing a challenge 
to the law by the cornhusker christian childrens home in hitchcock 
county neb 
cornhusker located on a 160acre ranch provides 24hour 
residential care to children placed by parents courts and the 
state department of social services 
the children attend public schools in culbertson neb and live 
in cottages in a familytype atmosphere with house parents 
up to 1983 cornhusker had a written policy on discipline that 
permitted a house parent to use corporal punishment such as the 
spanking on the buttocks by the open hand or a suitable instrument 
for the purpose of inflicting temporary pain 
but in 1983 state officials adopted a new policy prohibiting 
such corporal punishment 
cornhusker amended its disciplinary policy under protest and 
challenged the states policy in court at the time 15 children 
ranging in age from 8 to 16 lived at the home 
a state trial judge found the state regulation invalid on state 
law grounds 
the nebraska supreme court last december reversed the trial 
judges ruling and reinstated the state regulation barring corporal 
punishment at homes such as cornhusker 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for cornhusker argued that 
the nospanking state policy violates the rights of parents who 
entrust their children to such homes 
the regulation is a remarkable state intrusion on a clear and 
oftrecognized parental liberty interest to control and direct the 
welfare of a child the appeal said 
the case is cornhusker christian childrens home vs nebraska

the supreme court ruled today that police in 
pennsylvania did not violate the rights of a man suspected of 
drunken driving by failing to read the motorist his socalled 
miranda warnings soon enough 
the justices by a 72 vote in an unsigned opinion agreed with 
pennsylvania law enforcement officials that a lower court wrongly 
required police to warn motorists of their right against 
selfincrimination 
relying on a 1984 ruling the court said that ordinarily when 
police stop a motorist they are not required to give the miranda 
warnings because the motorist is not in custody 
the motorist was not entitled to a recitation of his 
constitutional rights prior to arrest and his roadside responses 
to questioning were admissible as evidence the court said 
justices thurgood marshall and john paul stevens dissented 
thomas a bruder jr was stopped in newtown township pa the 
morning of jan 19 1985 by a police officer who said bruder was 
driving erratically 
the officer said bruder was swerving back and forth across the 
highway he said that after stopping his car and emerging bruder 
had difficulty maintaining his balance 
the officer asked bruder if he had been drinking and bruder 
replied in the affirmative the policeman also asked bruder to 
recite the alphabet a task the officer said bruder performed 
poorly 
after that bruder was arrested and warned that he had a right 
to a lawyer to remain silent and that anything he said could be 
held against him 
a judge found him guilty of driving under the influence of 
alcohol and sentenced him to a term of 48 hours to six months in 
jail 
a threejudge state court overturned the conviction last year 
ruling that bruder was entitled to the miranda warnings earlier 
the state court said bruder was entitled to the warnings before 
being questioned by the police officer even though he had not been 
arrested formally 
bruder had good reason to believe he was not free to leave and 
in effect was in police custody when stopped the state court said 
the test of custodial interrogation is whether the individual 
being interrogated reasonably believes his freedom of action is 
being restricted the state court said undoubtedly bruder 
was not free to leave when he made the statements elicited 
also the state court said requiring bruder to recite the 
alphabet was akin to taking testimony from him and should not 
occur before he was read his rights 
the state court contrasted the recitation with taking a purely 
physical test for sobriety such as walking a straight line 
we view the recitation of the alphabet as essentially 
communicative in nature the state court said it said bruder 
could be retried but his premiranda statements and testimony 
about reciting the alphabet must be excluded 
pennsylvania law enforcement officials said the state court 
ruling violates a 1984 supreme court decision that permitted police 
to question motorists without giving the miranda warnings 
the high court said in the 1984 case that the vast majority of 
roadside detentions last only a few minutes and are conducted in 
public generally the court said then the motorist feels he will 
be permitted to go on his way and is not completely at the mercy of 
the police 
the pennsylvania state court said the 1984 decision does not 
rule out the possibility that in some cases police even prior to 
arrest must warn motorists of their rights before questioning them 
the case is pennsylvania vs bruder 88161

the supreme court today allowed public school 
officials in california to ban leaflets and school yearbook 
advertisements that promoted a studentrun lunchhour bible study 
group 
the court rejected an appeal by two students who said the 
officials violated their freespeech rights 
justices william j brennan thurgood marshall and harry a 
blackmun voted to hear arguments in the case but the votes of at 
least four justices are required to grant such review 
the students alexander perumal and frederick read were barred 
by saddleback valley school district officials during the 198485 
school year from distributing the religious club flyers or placing 
ads in their high school yearbooks 
perumal attended el toro high school and read went to mission 
viejo high school in the saddleback valley district 
officials allowed the students members of a group called new 
life to run bible study and prayer groups during lunch hour 
outside the school building 
but the officials said permitting distribution of the handbills 
and yearbook ads would violate constitutionally required separation 
of church and state 
the officials said permitting distribution of religious 
literature and advertisements in effect would be giving 
government backing to the bible study group 
the school district said it was acting in accord with a formal 
policy that limits the use of school facilities to officially 
approved student organizations and clubs 
the officials noted that in 1981 the district withdrew 
recognition of the new life group after some parents complained 
but perumal and read said the school district was practicing 
unlawful censorship by restricting free expression about religion 
a california appeals court in a 21 ruling in january said the 
school officials acted properly 
the appeals court said a school may decide to prohibit 
offcampus groups from functioning or advertising on campus 
the appeals court also said the saddleback valley policy 
permitting only schoolsponsored activities to function complies 
with the supreme courts test for assuring separation of church and 
state 
that threepart test permits governmentsponsored activities 
that have a primary secular purpose do not advance religion and do 
not cause entanglement between government and religion

the wichita kan eaglebeacon broke with the gop for the first 
time in its history by endorsing democrat michael dukakis joining 
several newspapers nationwide that backed dukakis and criticized 
george bushs negative campaign tactics 
dukakis also was endorsed by the new york times the boston 
globe the star tribune of minneapolis the philadelphia inquirer 
the charlotte nc observer the greensboro nc news amp record 
and new york newsday which called bushs campaign sniveling 
dirty distorted and irresponsible 
but the globe said its endorsement came despite our uneasiness 
with dukakis leadership style and with the lack of focus in his 
campaign the newspaper said its temptation to endorse no one was 
overcome when bush displayed extraordinary weakness in choosing 
sen dan quayle as his running mate 
it also called the race one of the most trivial elections in 
recent memory pitting two candidates as notable for their 
weaknesses as their strengths 
bush picked up endorsements sunday from the detroit news the 
seattle postintelligencer the arizona republic and the denver 
post which said that after wiping away the mud from both 
candidates the post believes george bush is the better choice 
the eaglebeacon the largest newspaper in heavily republican 
kansas said in a sunday editorial that the democratic nominee 
seems uniquely prepared to deal with the crises certain to 
confront the next president 
dukakis has shown much deeper sensitivity toward the struggles 
of millions of americans to make ends meet the newspaper said 
eaglebeacon managing editor william r handy said it was the 
papers first endorsement of a democrat for president since the 
wichita eagle and the wichita beacon were formed in 1872 and the 
two papers merged into a morning edition in 1980 
this year the editorial board said it was disgusted with 
republican nominee george bushs negative campaign tactics 
i think it reveals the broad distaste that the bush campaign 
really both campaigns has left in the mouth of the american 
people neavoll said 
gov michael dukakis has drawn criticism from his fellow 
democrats because he has refused or has been unable to match 
the republicans in meanspiritedness and contempt for the american 
voters the newspaper said 
the editorial also said that while bush has more than 20 years 
in public service he has left his fingerprints on so few 
positive accomplishments it also questioned bushs choice of 
sen dan quayle of indiana a feckless shallow politically 
immature man as his vice presidential running mate 
the new york times said the scales were tipped in dukakis favor 
as the candidate likely to do a better job of getting america out 
of hock from the reagan administrations deficits which it 
called the most urgent task facing the next president 
the vice president also was endorsed by the sunday oregonian of 
portland that states largest newspaper the miami herald and five 
smaller florida newspapers as well as the topeka kan 
capitaljournal the maine sunday telegram of portland and the 
blade of toledo and the akron beacon journal in ohio 
dukakis won the endorsement of the daytona beach fla 
newsjournal the tallahassee fla democrat and kentuckys two 
largest papers the courierjournal of louisville and the lexington 
heraldleader as well as the roanoke va times amp world news 
the st paul minn pioneer press dispatch endorsed both 
candidates saying its editorial board was divided on which 
candidate would make the better president 
the des moines register the largest newspaper in iowa endorsed 
dukakis as best equipped to turn the nations attention to 
longneglected domestic needs the paper criticized bushs smear 
campaign and his alarming choice of quayle as a running mate 
the cedar rapids gazette the second largest paper in iowa 
backed bush for his promise of no new taxes and his support for the 
nicaraguan contra rebels and the star wars plan for a spacebased 
missile defense system

the lenin shipyard a hotbed of labor 
activism where strikes eight years ago gave rise to the solidarity 
trade union movement will be closed dec 1 because it is losing 
money the government said today 
solidarity leader lech walesa an electrician at the shipyard 
said workers were ready to take over the business and run it 
profitably the shipyard was closed today because of a holiday and 
is to reopen wednesday 
walesa called the decision a personal provocation of prime 
minister rakowski against the birthplace of solidarity 
the shipyard is the first big industrial enterprise to be 
singled out for closure by the government of prime minister 
mieczyslaw f rakowski who promised to aggressively restructure 
polish industry 
rakowski was a firm supporter of the dec 13 1981 martial law 
crackdown that crushed solidarity the soviet blocs first free 
trade union he was named prime minister sept 27 to replace 
zbigniew messner who was criticized as ineffectual in reforming 
the inefficient and debtridden economy 
rakowski said the move has nothing to do with solidarity in 
a radio interview with the british broadcasting corp he said 
if someone wants to make the polish economy more healthy he has 
to start with very strong steps 
walesa in a statement released by an aide said solidarity 
will defend the enterprise which is for the union and for the 
whole nation a symbol of the struggle for a new and better 
poland 
the governments move comes as it bickers with solidarity over 
proposed talks on social and economic reforms including 
legalization of solidarity 
after walesa persuaded workers in august to end a wave of 
nationwide strikes authorities said they would sit down with the 
opposition to discuss grievances but officials object to 
solidaritys choice of negotiators 
the official news agency pap said rakowski approved the decision 
to close the shipyard saturday it referred to a speech he made 
oct 13 when he presented his government to the parliament 
rakowski announced that his government will go from words and 
plans to firm acts which would recover the polish economy 
that would include liquidation of enterprises that are 
inefficient unproductive and some enterprises which require 
subsidies from the state treasury the agency said 
the shipyards workers will be offered jobs at other enterprises 
in gdansk province pap said it said the 10000 workers will have 
some 30000 jobs to choose from 
pap said the announcement of the closure is not a surprise for 
public opinion or for the work force of the lenin shipyard the 
possibility of liquidating this shipyard has been discussed in 
public for a long time 
the shipyard scene of strikes in may and august has for two 
decades been a center of union activity but has been in decline for 
years 
it was scheduled to build 11 ships this year primarily for the 
soviet union which as an ally is afforded very favorable purchase 
terms in the late 1970s it produced a high of 27 ships a year and 
had more than 15000 employees 
one newspaper described it as a a giant on partly rotten 
legs 
but the shipyards director of foreign trade ireneusz kubiczek 
said in july that the business was not necessarily unprofitable and 
its main problem was a lack of work force to handle all the 
potential contracts 
in august 1980 a strike at the lenin shipyard gave rise to 
solidarity solidaritys membership grew to 10 million before it 
was banned in 1982 
walesa said in a telephone interview that the union could cope 
with the yards problem if given the chance 
we are ready to take over this enterprise and make it 
profitable we will help the workers council take it over so 
that the shipyard can work well and make its profits he said 
walesa said he saw the announcement which came during the 
fourday all saints day holiday when poles remember their dead as 
an attempt by the government to provoke protests at the shipyards 
and in other factories 
there were no immediate announcements of protests but the rev 
henryk jankowski pastor of st brygidas church a few blocks from 
the shipyards gates said he would celebrate masses for the 
shipyard workers every night this week culminating with a mass on 
sunday 
liquidating the shipyards property will take at least one year 
pap said production equipment not taken over by neighboring 
shipyards will be converted to different uses it said 
the liquidation program assumes completing construction of those 
ships already begun pap said remaining contracts outstanding will 
be passed to other shipyards it said 
rakowskis government has signaled on several occasions that it 
would move briskly to shut down moneylosing enterprises that drain 
huge subsidies from the state 
industry minister mieczyslaw wilczek said last week he has asked 
his ministry staff to make a list of the countrys 150 least 
efficient enterprises for possible closure

the supreme court agreed today to consider 
reviving an attempt by congress to limit the presidents authority 
to withhold classified information from the nations legislative 
branch 
the court said it will review a ruling that invalidated a law 
aimed at giving congress more access to national security 
information 
the justices are expected to announce their decision in 1989 
a federal judge had ruled the law violates the required 
separation of legislative and executive powers 
the clash between congress and the president over classified 
information is a longstanding one 
but the case acted on today has more recent origins in a 
national security directive adopted by president reagan in 983 
the directive requires federal officials before they are 
allowed access to classified information to sign an agreement that 
they will not disclose the information 
the directive also established a standard form for officials to 
sign promising they never will divulge classified or 
classifiable information without written permission from proper 
authorities 
some members of congress bridled at the directive particularly 
the use of the word classifiable 
they said the presidential order restricts the freespeech 
rights of federal employees and allows afterthefact 
classification of information in order to punish whistleblowers for 
making disclosures that embarrass their superiors 
opponents of the presidential directive said the secrecy 
agreement that federal employees were forced to sign would bar them 
for life from revealing information to congress which it is 
entitled to receive 
congress then enacted legislation prohibiting use of funds 
during the 198788 fiscal year to implement the standard forms 
reagan had authorized 
the legislation attached to a general government spending bill 
was aimed at blocking the executive branch from withholding 
classifiable information or from impeding congressional access 
to such material 
us district judge oliver gasch declared the legislation 
unconstitutional last may 
the statute impermissibly restricts the presidents power to 
fulfill obligations imposed upon him by his express constitutional 
powers and the role of the executive in foreign relations gasch 
said 
in other action today the court 
agreed to decide whether states must continue to provide 
lawyers for indigent death row inmates after they have lost their 
initial round of appeals 
the court said it will hear an appeal by virginia officials who 
said requiring states to pay for attorneys in such cases could lead 
to interminable delays in carrying out executions 
killed a lawsuit against the government stemming from the 
world war ii mass detention of japaneseamericans in us prison 
camps 
the court without comment left intact rulings that the 
veterans of the internment camps waited too long to file suit 
seeking compensation for property losses 
rejected an appeal by kansas prosecutors challenging state 
laws that broadly justify using deadly force to defend someones 
home or personal property 
the justices without comment let stand kansas laws that permit 
use of deadly force even by people not threatened with death or 
great bodily harm 
let stand a ruling that a state may ban the possession of 
child pornography 
the court citing a lack of jurisdiction rejected an appeal by 
an illinois couple who say state officials are intruding into the 
privacy of the home to impose censorship 
declined to further expand its study of drug testing in the 
workplace rejecting an appeal by justice department employees who 
say such tests would violate their rights 
the court without comment refused to intercede in the case 
which has yet to be argued before a lower court 
ruled that police in pennsylvania did not violate the rights 
of a man suspected of drunken dirving by failing to read the 
motorist his socalled miranda warnings soon enough 
the justices by a 72 vote in an unsigned opinion agreed with 
pennsylvania law enforcement officials that a lower court wrongly 
required police to warn motorists of their right against 
selfincrimination 
allowed public school officials in california to ban leaflets 
and school yearbook advertisements that promoted a studentrun 
lunchhour bible study group 
the court rejected an appeal by two students who said the 
officials violated their freespeech rights 
in the classifiedinformation case the american foreign service 
association representing members of the nations diplomatic corps 
joined with senators and house members from both political parties 
in appealing to the supreme court to reinstate the law 
the reagan administration defended gaschs ruling 
surely the first amendment does not confer an unfettered right 
on an employee of the executive branch to disclose whatever 
national security information he pleases outside authorized 
channels whether to a member of the public or to a member of 
congress the justice department said 
the law that gasch threw out expired on sept 30 with the end of 
the fiscal year but a similar rider was attached to the spending 
bill enacted for the current fiscal year 
president reagan announced wednesday that he was pocketvetoing 
another measure intended to give new protection to federal 
employees who expose government fraud and abuse 
the president said the bill which is not tied directly to the 
case acted on by the court today violates the constitution since 
congress has adjourned it cannot vote to override the veto 
the case is american foreign service association vs garfinkel

a woman died two days after a transplant 
operation in which she received the kidney of her daughter who had 
died in a car accident hospital officials said today 
hank black a spokesman for university hospital said antoinette 
moore 54 of gadsden died sunday evening on friday doctors had 
given her the kidney of her 26yearold daughter terri moore 
following the daughters death from injuries suffered in a car 
wreck earlier in the week 
mrs moore had suffered from kidney problems for seven years 
and had needed dialysis a mechanical method of cleansing the 
blood for the last few months 
black said an autopsy was being performed today to determine the 
cause of mrs moores death 
he said mrs moore did return to the operating room earlier 
sunday because of excessive bleeding but there was no immediate 
word from doctors on how the death might have been related to any 
postoperative problems 
mrs moores husband jay c moore had said that he had mixed 
emotions about the transplanting of his daughters kidney into his 
ailing wife 
i just tell myself that im doing what my daughter would have 
wanted he said 
the daughter was pronounced dead thursday afternoon at a gadsden 
hospital following a roadway accident tuesday black said the 
daughter recently told her family that she wanted to become an 
organ donor so her family followed her wishes 
moore said his wife knew before the surgery that she was 
receiving her daughters kidney 
mrs moore had previously turned down her healthy 32yearold 
sons offer to donate one of his kidneys because of the threat to 
his life that might occur if his other kidney failed 
black had said that ms moores other kidney was designated for 
transplanting into a recipient in florida

here are excerpts from the videotaped 
messages received from american hostage terry anderson since his 
abduction march 16 1985 
oct 4 1986 after the release from soviet custody of american 
journalist nicholas daniloff 
after 2 years of empty of empty talks and refusals to act on 
the part of the reagan administration it hurt to see the 
propaganda and bombast with which that administration solved the 
problem of mr daniloff a citizen like us who was imprisoned only 
a short time 
how can any official justify the interest attention and action 
given in that case and the inattention given ours 
we are surprised that the american government has put pressure 
on other arab and european governments not to negotiate in such 
cases as ours but surrendered itself on the daniloff case 
releasing the russian spy gennadiy zakharov who was working 
against our people 
dec 24 1987 
to my government i dont know what to say to my family i love 
you and miss you very much i am in good health but tired and 
very lonely 
mr president i say again this cannot continue there is a 
limit for how long we can last and some of us are approaching their 
limit surely by now you know what must be done and how you can 
do it this is difficult but you can do it there have been enough 
careful consideration cold discussion and enough secret 
maneuvering 
i know that youre trying to get us out though i dont know 
exactly what it is youve been doing i only know that it hasnt 
been enough or the right thing 
oct 31 1988 following his 41st birthday 
im well and being well treated i received your birthday 
greetings and as always that helped me very much 
but as my fourth birthday in captivity passes and as the end of 
my fourth year in captivity approaches i find it difficult to 
keep my hopes and my courage high 
ive been very close to being released several times but 
each time it seems that the us government uses its influence to 
stop any agreement i dont understand this 
i gather theres been very little discussion about this problem 
in the us presidential campaign and thats disappointing as is 
president reagans complete failure to find a solution during his 
eight years in office 
i heard on the radio of the generous and ambitious effort to 
free three trapped whales a few days ago and the presidents thanks 
to the soviet union for its help that kind of cooperation and 
spirit is absolutely necessary to bring this situation to an end 
once again this has gone on too long it cant continue like 
this

the pilot of delta flight 1141 told 
investigators he wishes he had applied full power immediately after 
the first sign of trouble and not 23 seconds later as his boeing 
727 was about to crash documents revealed today 
the crash aug 31 at the dallasfort worth international airport 
claimed 14 lives there were 108 people aboard the jet bound for 
salt lake city 
a transcript of the cockpit voice recorder tape among the eight 
sets of documents released by the national transportation safety 
board showed a routine takeoff down the runway with the plane 
gaining proper speed and climbing power 
seconds after liftoff however there was the sound of a 
snap and then the jets control column began to shake an 
advance warning that the aircraft was about to stall 
somethings wrong capt larry davis who was at the 
controls was believed to have said his exact words were not clear 
then followed the sounds of what is believed to be five 
compressor stalls in the engines and the copilot announcing an 
engine failure investigators have said they have found no 
evidence of a mechanical malfunction in any of the three engines 
were not gonna to make it davis said nearly 15 seconds 
after the first snap was heard 
but it was eight seconds more before he called for full 
power according to the transcript less than a second later came 
the sound of the first impact 
davis said in interviews with ntsb investigators that in 
retrospect i should have pushed up full power immediately 
according to a separate document made public today by the ntsb 
during the interview davis also said that he was aware his 
aircraft had an unusually high noseup position as it struggled to 
gain lift but that he was afraid to lower the nose the normal 
maneuver in an attempt to fly out of a stall because he thought 
impact with the ground was imminent 
davis said that in the seconds after liftoff the boeing 727 
began to roll violently he told investigators it was all i 
could do to control the airplane 
he said at one point he thought we were going to make it but 
then we got more bangs 
investigators have closely examined the three engines of the 
jetliner and concluded that there was no mechanical failure the 
bangs have been widely interpreted as the compressor stalls caused 
by an interruption of air flow possibly because of an unusual 
angle of the aircraft 
the ntsb previously has said that there is evidence the planes 
flaps might not have been extended properly for takeoff which 
would have inhibited the planes ability to gain lift the flaps 
were found in a retracted position in the wreckage as was the 
cockpit lever controlling the flaps 
but the transcript of the cockpit voice recorder tape released 
today indicates as has been disclosed previously that the flight 
crew followed a pretakeoff checklist that included specific 
reference to the flap setting 
flaps the flight engineer steven judd was heard to say 
fifteen fifteen green light responded the copilot carey 
kirkland 
the numbers were a reference to the degree of extension for the 
flaps on the left and right wings green light referred to an 
indicator light denoting the position of the wing slats which also 
must be extended in a takeoff

an infuriated lech walesa vowed monday to 
fight government plans to close down the lenin shipyard the site 
where the solidarity trade union was born 
the stateowned shipyard in gdansk is being closed down dec 1 
it is the first big industrial plant to be singled out for closure 
by the monthold government of prime minister mieczyslaw f 
rakowski 
the decision was announced while the shipyard was closed on the 
eve of all saints day and caught many workers and solidarity 
activists by surprise the yard reopens wednesday 
a longtime foe of solidarity rakowski took office sept 27 with 
a pledge to restructure polands aging industrial base and get the 
economy moving in an interview with the bbc he said the decision 
has nothing to do with solidarity 
the announcement came during an impasse in preparations for 
talks between representatives of solidarity and the government 
which had been promised to walesa on aug 31 during the last strike 
at the shipyard 
in an interview with the associated press walesa denounced the 
decision as rakowskis personal provocation against the 
birthplace of solidarity rakowski was a firm supporter of the 
dec 13 1981 martiallaw crackdown on solidarity 
walesa himself a worker at the shipyard said in a later 
statement that solidarity will defend the enterprise which is for 
the union and for the whole nation a symbol of the struggle for a 
new and better poland 
the staterun news agency pap said rakowski on saturday approved 
an industry minstry recommendation to close the yard it referred 
to the premiers oct 13 speech when he presented his plan to 
parliament 
rakowski told the bbc that there is no other way if someone 
wants to make the polish economy more healthy he has to start with 
very strong steps 
rakowski announced that his government will go from words and 
plans to firm acts which would recover the polish economy pap 
said that would include liquidation of enterprises that are 
inefficient unproductive and some enterprises which require 
subsidies from the state treasury 
pap added the decision should come as no surprise because the 
possibility has been discussed publicly for a long time 
rakowski replaced prime minister zbigniew messner who was 
criticized as ineffectual in reforming polands inefficient and 
debtridden economy 
since taking over he has announced cuts in several government 
departments and allowed several independent groups to be legalized 
but closing the lenin yard is his first move to streamline polands 
heavy industry 
the centuryold shipyard the scene of strikes in may and 
august employs about 10000 workers and was scheduled to build 11 
ships this year it constructs ships primarily for the soviet union 
for nonconvertible currency 
articles in the press have questioned its financial efficacy 
with one newspaper describing the lenin shipyard as a giant on 
partly rotten legs 
a strike at the shipyard in august 1980 gave rise to solidarity 
the east blocs first independent trade union whose membership grew 
to 10 million before the union was banned in october 1982 
but the yard has been in decline for more than a decade in the 
late 1970s it produced a high of 27 ships one year at that time 
its employment was more than 15000 
in july the yards director of foreign trade ireneusz 
kubiczek said the yard was not necessarily unprofitable and said 
its chief problem was a lack of workforce to handle all its 
potential contracts 
he said whether it was profitable or not was debatable since it 
all depended on the costs arbitrarily set by the state for 
materials taxes and credit but management admitted it needed new 
loans or subsidies in order to continue production 
walesa said his union could cope with the yards financial 
problem if given the chance 
we are ready to take over this enterprise and make it 
profitable we will help the workers council take it over so 
that the shipyard can work well and make its profits he said 
he said he saw the announcement as an attempt by the government 
to provoke protests at the shipyards and in other factories 
the rev henryk jankowski pastor of st brygidas church near 
the shipyards gates said he would celebrate masses for shipyard 
workers every night this week culminating with a big mass on 
sunday but there were no immediate plans for protest actions 
we will have to work out a general stand for the union said 
bogdan lis solidarity regional leader in gdansk i think that it 
could lead to a new strike 
walesa last week refused to meet with interior minister gen 
czeslaw kiszczak about a government demand he drop two proposed 
solidarity delegates to the talks whom the government considers too 
extreme 
on friday prime minister margaret thatcher of great britain 
plans to visit the towering solidarity monument just outside the 
shipyard gates 
the pap communique said the shipyards workers would be offered 
jobs at other enterprises in gdansk province it said the 10000 
workers will have 30000 jobs to choose from 
liquidating the shipyards property will take at least a year 
the communique said 
rakowskis government has signaled on several occasions it would 
move briskly to shut down moneylosing enterprises that are a drain 
on the state 
perhaps fewer and fewer shipyards would make for more 
efficient shipyards newly appointed industry minister mieczyslaw 
wilczek told a news conference last week wilczek said he has asked 
for a list of the countrys 150 leastefficient enterprises for 
possible closure

republican nominee george bush today 
mocked michael dukakis sudden embrace of the liberal label as a 
breakthrough and dismissed his democratic rivals invitation to 
an electioneve debate next monday night 
the vice president said the real debate should feature dukakis 
and dukakis the new left vs the old left 
a combative bush attacked dukakis for his declaration that 
yes im a liberal during a campaign swing sunday through 
california and a new poll showed the vice president with a 
15point lead over the massachusetts governor 
the survey taken last week by the courierjournal in 
louisville said bush had a 53 percent to 38 percent advantage in 
kentucky a dramatic gain from his twopoint lead around labor day 
nine electoral votes are at stake in kentucky where the 
bushdukakis battle originally was predicted to be close 
after weeks of trying to avoid the liberal label that bush 
repeatedly sought to paste on him dukakis suddenly wore it proudly 
sunday im a liberal in the tradition of franklin roosevelt and 
harry truman and john kennedy he said 
bush wasted no time in responding today at his first rally of a 
campaign day that also will take him to st louis and kansas city 
mo 
now for the breakthrough the gop nominee said 
bush recalled that during their last nationally broadcast debate 
in los angeles on oct 13 dukakis jumped all over me for using 
the l word well speaking of my opponent yesterday miracle of 
miracles headlines read all about it hes using the liberal 
label again 
dukakis had challenged bush to a onehour debate the night 
before the nov 8 balloting to talk about what it takes to lead 
this country and unite this country 
bush chimed in with a counterproposal there should be a 
debate dukakis vs dukakis an entertaining debate the new left 
vs the old left 
he added the governor of massachusetts could suddenly pretend 
to be in the tradition that is prepared to use force to defend 
freedom but then the other governor of massachusetts could explain 
why he failed to support that needed military action in grenada or 
the action against that terrorist moammar gadhafi and why he has 
opposed every weapon system to modernize our defense what a 
debate 
one could claim to be on the side of ordinary americans and 
the other dukakis could explain why he thinks ordinary americans 
oppose the death penalty for drug kingpins like he does favor 
these weekend furloughs for firstdegree murderers who have not 
served enough time to be eligible for parole and oppose a law 
that would require teachers to lead their classes in reciting the 
pledge of allegiance bush said 
dukakis vs dukakis he said what a debate it should be 
very very interesting 
as the crowd applauded bush concluded will the real liberal 
please stand up god knows what would happen 
campaigning in philadelphia on sunday bush told reporters he 
didnt believe recent polls indicating that his lead over dukakis 
is narrowing 
the dukakis camp said bushs lead had shrunk to six percentage 
points but gop aides said it had settled in the doubledigit range 
after some fluctuations 
a new time magazine poll of 1096 probable voters showed bush 
leading by 10 percentage points 50 percent to 40 percent the 
survey was conducted tuesday and wednesday and results had a margin 
of error of plus or minus three percentage points 
his schedule later in the week tentatively calls for him to hit 
indiana wisconsin illinois michigan ohio and california 
bush speaking to supporters outside the campaigns headquarters 
in suburban montgomery county pa encouraged voters to go to the 
polls on election day 
from now on its get out that vote as for barbara and me 
were going to keep running like were 10 points behind nobody is 
going to outwork us he told the gathering 
bushs chief of staff craig fuller said campaign officials had 
always expected to see the poll numbers tighten and were not 
alarmed by the latest apparent shift toward dukakis 
i think its to be expected as you get to the final days of 
the campaign that youre going to see some tightening in this race 
but thats going to cause us to work harder well not allow 
ourselves to lose the edge weve had as a campaign team fuller 
said 
meanwhile bush campaign chairman james a baker iii repudiated 
a republican campaign flier circulating in maryland with 
sidebyside photographs of dukakis and willie horton jr a 
convicted murderer who raped a maryland woman and slashed her 
fiance after he escaped while on a massachusetts prison furlough 
dukakis held bush personally responsible for the fundraising 
letter which asks is this your profamily team for 1988 
baker appearing on the cbstvs face the nation said the 
flier was totally out of bounds and totally unauthorized 
but he said the bush campaign could do nothing about it 
you cannot control every party organization throughout the 
country he said

dissidents will be rescinded and another likely will be revised to 
cover specific acts against the state the official soviet news 
agency tass said today 
it was the second promise within a week of impending 
improvements for soviet dissidents west german chancellor helmut 
kohl said last week after talks in moscow with officials including 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev that he had been told all 
people regarded in the west as political prisoners will be freed by 
the end of the year 
on monday justice minister boris kravtsov told tass that 
article 190 the law banning antisoviet slander apparently 
will be dropped in the current review of the soviet criminal code 
article 70 barring antisoviet agitation and propaganda 
probably will be restricted to cover concrete actions kravtsov 
said 
he also said the law on exit visas is being revised in 
accordance with an international agreement on civil and political 
rights 
kravtsov said only eight people are serving sentences under the 
two antidissent laws

organization says it has information on 150 soviets imprisoned

rights it counted 10000 a few years ago

there is a spiritual conflict over the culture of 
militarism he said on one side theres a story of imperial 
america its manifest destiny and rambo and make my day theres

hd ross a local retired judge says 
democrat wayne dowdy has a winning combination in his uphill senate 
race against republican trent lott we got the old folks the 
rednecks and the blacks and there aint nothing in this state can 
beat it 
that observation may contain a bit of bravado for dowdy trails 
lott by eight percentage points in the latest statewide poll but 
it also expresses a belief that politics in mississippi havent 
changed as much as lott would like to think 
the schism in mississippi politics along racial and economic 
lines remains real but lott the smooth buttoneddown politician 
who has risen to the no 2 gop leadership position in the house of 
representatives believes the balance is changing 
wayne dowdy is a good ol boy and mississippi is getting away 
from good ol boys lott said last week in clarksdale the hub of 
cottongrowing delta country people perceive him as a 
backbencher they see me as somebody who rose to a leadership 
position 
in his three house terms dowdy took an active role in 
supporting renewal of the voting rights act but otherwise has not 
left a great legislative imprint 
mississippis electorate is about onethird black and 
substantially rural the state long the nations poorest has made 
major economic strides in the past two decades there are growing 
numbers of young professionals who live mostly along the gulf coast 
and in jackson the capital city and they are overwhelmingly 
republican 
the challenge for dowdy 45 is to get the maximum turnout by 
blacks who he believes will cast 90 percent or more of their votes 
for him and to grab about one of every three white voters 
dowdy concedes that will be difficult but says he has a 
reputation as a comefrombehind campaigner and that pollsters miss 
many of his supporters who dont have telephones 
on that night in clarksdale the joint appearance by the two 
candidates battling for the seat of retiring sen john c stennis 
dmiss reflected their philosophical differences 
addressing a prolott chamber of commerce crowd of 300 people 
dowdy made a pitch for better roads and schools two areas where he 
said the federal government should play a greater role lott 
countered that the answer to the states problems is economic 
development 
the answer is the private sector lott said he called for a 
cut in the capital gains tax rate which is one of republican 
presidential nominee george bushs favorite campaign themes 
ironically lott received the heartiest applause of the evening 
when he specifically urged widening us 61 a worn northsouth 
artery through the delta from two to four lanes 
for dowdy and his supporters such moments are frustrating they 
say that lott 47 has built an eightterm congressional career on 
pinching pennies including funds for his own state but is using 
slick advertising to avoid paying the political price for those 
past votes 
although he campaigns for road improvements lott has voted 
against transportation appropriations bills in the house a 
television ad shows him canoeing through the wilderness though an 
environmental group has listed him among the dirty dozen in 
congress with the worst environmental voting records lott claims 
to be among the staunchest defenders of social security but does 
not mention his 1981 vote to eliminate the minimum benefit 
lotts tv ads are produced by robert goodman who made the 
morning in america spots for president reagan in 1984 and they 
have been effective in softening the gop candidates cool partisan 
edge 
sometimes i get that teflon feeling says dowdy supporter 
walter thompson referring to reagans famed ability to shed 
political negatives we have not educated the people on what 
lotts votes really are 
lott stumps from town to town before crowds turned out by a 
welloiled campaign machine dowdys efforts seem more haphazard as 
he makes unannounced visits to courthouses and local businesses 
lott seems to have generated enthusiasm in jackson where his 
campaign posters have sprouted in the yards of white middleclass 
neighborhoods the same signs are prominent along the main drags of 
smaller towns too 
dowdy a country lawyer from mccomb who became wealthy enough to 
buy several radio stations seems unconcerned we dont get the 
main street crowd he says 
although he has outspent dowdy by 26 million to 16 million 
lott has never broken much above 50 percent in the polls which 
gives the democratic candidate some comfort dowdy has gone on the 
air with his own ads one of which features an endorsement by the 
widely revered stennis 
in the end its going to be decided among independent voters 
as to likability dowdy said 
one of dowdys big frustrations is having a massachusetts 
governor michael dukakis at the top of his partys national 
ticket 
it is hard to imagine two states more different culturally than 
massachusetts and mississippi when asked about dukakis dowdy 
prefers to talk instead about sen lloyd bentsen of texas the vice 
presidential candidate 
we are not running from dukakis but his campaign is not doing 
that well in our state dowdy observes he predicts that bush 
who is running more than 20 points ahead of dukakis in mississippi 
will help lott by several percentage points

prime minister noboru takeshita quietly cast off 
the shadow of a dynamic predecessor during his first year in 
office but now faces two major tests a political scandal and the 
approaching death of emperor hirohito 
takeshita is undynamic even by japanese political standards he 
minimizes conflicts by seldom speaking out and waits until a 
consensus has formed before making political moves 
his approach is a sharp contrast to the flamboyant 
selfconfidence of his predecessor yasuhiro nakasone who became 
one of the few japanese political leaders with a strong image 
abroad 
takeshitas approach is a return to the traditional japanese 
political style says yozo yokota professor of international law 
at international christian university in tokyo 
nakasone was outwardlooking but not so good at gathering 
support within the ruling liberal democratic party he said 
takeshita is the reverse he spends time listening to various 
views in the party and then seeks a consensus he doesnt have his 
own policies or philosophy 
during his first year as prime minister thursday is the 
anniversary takeshita has weathered two political crises 
announced an expansion of japans diplomatic activities dealt with 
two major trade disputes and presided over a vigorous economic 
recovery 
now however the 64yearold leader faces a growing 
stocktrading scandal involving top politicians and the inevitable 
death of hirohito who has been gravely ill since september 
the trading scandal involves shares in the recruitcosmos real 
estate company reportedly sold at low prices to dozens of prominent 
politicians business leaders and journalists before the stock was 
publicly traded when public trading began the value of the shares 
shot upward and the recipients made large profits 
takeshita nakasone finance minister kiichi miyazawa and other 
top officials acknowledged some aides bought recuitcosmos shares 
but said they did not know about it 
government officials have said the transactions were legal but 
opposition parties claim they were unethical and have demanded a 
parliamentary investigation 
if japans a parliament the diet investigates the stock 
scandal one test of takeshitas command will be whether he can 
prevent it from spreading into other areas of political financing 
there are a lot more disclosures to come said gregory 
clark professor of japanese studies at sophia university in tokyo 
the approaching death of hirohito 87 is an emotional issue for 
the nation 
japan has not experienced the death of an emperor under its 
postwar constitution which separates religion and the state 
takeshitas government must decide how to handle the many 
traditional shintobased funeral and related ceremonies 
some japanese continue to link the imperial system with rightist 
politics and militarism and see the transition as a critical 
period 
takeshita used adroit behindthescenes dealings and great skill 
at manipulating the party bureaucracy to work his way up through 
the ranks and became leader of the largest faction of the 
governing liberal democrats in 1987 
while nakasone often tried to circumvent government and party 
structures by establishing special study commissions and advisory 
groups takeshita has reaffirmed the role of bureaucrats with whom 
he feels comfortable 
on us demands for access to the japanese public works 
construction market takeshita gave complete negotiating authority 
to ichiro ozawa deputy chief cabinet secretary the dispute which 
dragged on for more than 1 years and came to symbolize trade 
differences between the two nations was settled in march with 
concessions from powerful japanese industry groups 
he also delegated negotiating power in talks on a us demand 
that japan eliminate import restrictions on beef and oranges 
trade friction has declined during takeshitas tenure because of 
slower growth in exports attributable to the yens higher value 
in two crises during his first year in office takeshita took 
little direct action allowing both to run their course until the 
people involved resigned 
one concerned seisuke okuno head of the national land agency 
who caused protests from abroad by saying that japan was not the 
aggressor in world war ii the other involved koichi hamada head 
of the powerful lower house budget committee who called an 
opposition politician a murderer 
in foreign policy takeshita was widely expected to remain under 
the influence of nakasone who took a special interest in the 
field instead he has traveled widely to build his own 
international reputation including trips to southeast asia north 
america europe the pacific south korea and china 
in june at the toronto summit of western leaders takeshita 
pledged that japan would expand its international political and 
diplomatic role and increase foreign aid over five years to the 
equivalent of 50 billion which would make it the worlds largest 
donor

former philippine first lady imelda marcos 
pleaded innocent to racketeering charges today but a federal judge 
refused to let her return to hawaii until government and defense 
lawyers iron out details of her 5 million bail 
mrs marcos brushed away a tear as us district judge john f 
keenan said im not going to let the lady go back to the 
hawaiian islands until im certain the bail is set he set 
another hearing for thursday 
she and her entourage arrived sunday by borrowed luxury jet from 
hawaii where she and ousted philippine president ferdinand marcos 
have lived in exile since fleeing their homeland in february 1986 
they are accused of embezzling 100 million from the philippines 
defense lawyers had convinced keenan that the 71yearold marcos 
was too frail to make the trip to new york city for a court 
appearance his arraignment was postponed at least until a 
government physician examines him 
the judge however ordered mrs marcos 59 to appear on the 
charges that she and her husband used the countrys money to buy 
property including four new york buildings and artwork 
as a small group of demonstrators changed antimarcos slogans 
mrs marcos strode into court dressed in black highheeled pumps 
and an aquablue offtheshoulder fulllength gown with puffy 
sleeves 
she spoke only twice during the 45minute hearing once to waive 
a reading of the indictment and once to answer not guilty 
after the innocent plea was entered the judge set bail to be 
secured by real estate cash and personal possessions amounting 
to a reasonable market value of 5 million 
the judge first said he would not detain mrs marcos but a 
hitch developed when prosecutors and defense lawyers could not 
agree on what property and cash would be used to secure the bail 
defense lawyers who originally wanted mrs marcos released 
without any bail had agreed to a bail package in which the 
marcoses would put up 12 million in philippine pesos along with 
jewelry the couple brought to the united states when they fled 
their homeland 
i dont see how that can possibly be used as bail said 
assistant us attorney charles labella noting that the jewelry is 
subject to subpoena in an ongoing grand jury investigation and the 
philippine currency is subject to a claim by the current government 
of that nation 
the judge ordered the parties to return to court thursday with 
details on bail mrs marcos was then sent to be fingerprinted 
the embezzlement and racketeering indictment was handed up oct 
21 the main racketeering charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 
years in prison upon conviction 
mrs marcos flew from hawaii on saturday the first time she has 
left the state since her exile there 
on sunday a limousine brought her to the waldorf towers one of 
the new york locations where she threw lavish parties as first 
lady she was surrounded by reporters and photographers bodyguards 
cleared a path as she and those with her strode inside the luxury 
apartmenthotel without comment 
a marcos associate in honolulu who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said mrs marcos hoped to shop and entertain old friends 
while in new york 
her real concern is that she also hasnt left her husbands 
side for three years and shes very concerned about his health 
john bartko a marcos attorney said in honolulu 
shes going to meet her legal obligation but i just dont see 
her having a gay old time in new york city 
sunday afternoon mrs marcos visited st patricks roman 
catholic cathedral aides said the waldorf bill which reportedly 
will run 1800 a night is to be paid by friends they wont 
identify 
the criminal indictment is similar to a 1986 civil lawsuit filed 
in california by the philippine government of marcos successor 
corazon aquino 
we developed an idea which the american courts bought that a 
dictator cant fleece his country deposit the loot in the united 
states and expect to get away with it said morton stavis 
president of the center for constitutional rights a nonprofit 
legal group representing the aquino government 
in response to the lawsuit an injunction was granted march 2 
1986 that prevented the sale or transfer of marcos new york 
properties which included four manhattan commercial buildings and 
a long island estate with a total value reportedly in the hundreds 
of millions of dollars 
mrs marcos arrived sunday in a private boeing 737 loaned by 
american tobacco co heiress doris duke the plane outfitted to 
carry just 19 brought mrs marcos entourage which included an 
attorney a nurse secretary and several friends 
the jet landed at newark international airport where reporters 
and about 40 supporters remained behind a gate out of sight from 
mrs marcos 
we wanted to show mrs marcos and president marcos that there 
are filipinos who still support them said willy paderon i 
hope they will be vindicated of all these politically motivated 
charges that are coming left and right 
they the us government doublecrossed the president you 
dont do that to friends its going to cost the us 
six others were indicted with the marcoses including saudi 
financier adnan khashoggi who is accused of acting as a front for 
marcos to help divert assets and hide his ownership of real estate 
and art

vice president george bush knew the united 
states secretly sold weapons to iran in an effort to secure freedom 
for american hostages but he was unaware he says that profits 
from the sales were later diverted to the nicaraguan contras 
bush who was chief of a presidential task force on terrorism 
has tried to minimize his involvement in the iran arms sale he has 
said mistakes were made but claimed he was out of the loop 
in making major policy decisions 
the congressional committees that investigated the irancontra 
affair said bush was present at a white house meeting on aug 6 
1985 at which participants talked about allowing the israelis to 
sell usmade missiles to iran 
president reagan made no decision on the weapons sales 
participants said but secretary of state george shultz and former 
secretary of defense caspar weinberger opposed the plan 
bush has steadfastly refused to reveal his recommendations if 
any to the president 
a few weeks later the first shipment of tow missiles was 
delivered to tehran 
the americans hoped the weapons sales would lead to freedom for 
us hostages held by proiranian groups in lebanon ultimately 
three hostages were released during the 14month period before the 
shipments were shopped in november 1986 
congressional committees and the tower commission made few 
references to bush portraying him as a largely passive figure 
maine senators william cohen a republican and george mitchell 
a democrat both members of the irancontra committee said in a 
book they wrote that bushs role remains an unanswered question 
they wrote that others in the reagan administration were convinced 
bush had supported the plan 
the vice president attended several meetings on the iran 
initiative but none of the participants recall his views the 
report said 
in february 1986 bushs task force on terrorism released a 
report recommending that no concessions be made to terrorists 
in august 1986 bush visited jerusalem where he received a 
briefing on the armsforhostages deal from amiram nir an israeli 
official who had worked with national security council officials on 
the deal 
nir said the weapons sales were designed to get and hostages 
out as well as to build better contact with iran nir told the 
vice president we are dealing with the most radical elements 
in iran according to the congressional report

resupply operation by former cia agent felix rodriguez in august 
1986 but gregg said he never passed along his information to bush 
because he did not consider these facts worthy of the vice 
presidents attention

scores of birds known as waxwings have arrived 
along the east coast of britain and an expert says they came from 
the soviet union in search of food 
christopher mead a bird specialist with the british trust for 
ornithology said the waxwings seen on sunday dont usually migrate 
to britain and came because of a sparse crop of the berries on 
which they survive 
waxwings which get their name from the red color at the tips of 
their wings were last seen in large numbers in britain in the 
1960s 
officials reported about 100 waxwings were first seen a week ago

israeli is a parliamentary democracy the government is headed 
by a prime minister traditionally chosen from the party with the 
most seats in the knesset the prime minister forms a cabinet 
which must be approved by the knesset 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
israelis vote for parties not individual candidates the number 
of knesset seats each wins depends on its proportion of the vote 
each party makes up numbered lists of candidates and those gaining 
seats are chosen by their order on the list 
twentyseven parties are running the two major parties are the 
rightwing likud bloc headed by prime minister yitzhak shamir and 
the leftofcenter labor party of foreign minister shimon peres 
in israels history neither major party has ever won an 
absolute majority meaning the government is always a coalition and 
small parties have influence beyond their numbers 
labor and likud each have three allied parties as likely 
coalition partners there also are eight religious parties which 
use their seats as swing votes to gain backing for jewish orthodox 
causes two arab parties an arabjewish party that favors creating 
a palestinian state and eight others most championing single 
causes 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
most polls predict a close race either with likud and its 
allies winning narrowly or a split vote that will again create a 
laborlikud coalition such as has governed since the last election 
in 1984 then neither major party could form a government without 
the other 
the polls are regarded as less than reliable because most are 
sponsored by labor or likud also most do not survey arabs 
religious jews soldiers and residents of collective farms

george bush today scoffed at michael dukakis weekend embrace of 
the liberal label calling it a miracle of miracles dukakis 
said the republican has stood on the wrong side of every issue 
of importance to voters 
with eight days left until election day and some polls 
indicating a race closer than earlier surveys suggested bush 
shored up support in kentucky and missouri while dukakis rallied 
california supporters and said im fired up 
bush recalled that dukakis had jumped all over me for using 
the l word in their last debate in los angeles well 
speaking of my opponent yesterday miracle of miracles headlines 
read all about it hes using the liberal label again the 
republican nominee said in louisville ky today 
bush also brushed off dukakis invitation for a third debate 
saying the real debate should be between dukakis and dukakis the 
new left versus the old left 
at stops from bakersfield to stockton on sunday dukakis told 
voters we need a president in the tradition yes the liberal 
tradition of franklin roosevelt harry truman and john kennedy 
dukakis dropped the l word as bush and president reagan 
regularly call it during his appearances today but still referred 
to the heritage of roosevelt truman and kennedy 
in san jose dukakis said bush has been on the wrong side of 
every issue singling out issues of importance especially to 
women such as pay equity parental leave and health insurance 
in a slap at bushs long resume of appointed posts dukakis also 
said you cant inherit the white house you have to earn the 
right to be president of the united states 
questioned by reporters about his decision to embrace the label 
he has shunned for months dukakis said he comes from the liberal 
tradition of presidents who were on the side of average 
americans presidents who helped to build middle class america 
harry truman was a liberal who believed in balancing budgets 
and thats the tradition i come from the massachusetts governor 
said 
though the dukakis campaign sought to characterize california 
with its 47 electoral votes as a tossup based on their internal 
polling a new abc news poll put bush ahead 51 percent to 44 
percent the poll of 510 likely voters was conducted saturday and 
sunday 
bush stumped in philadelphias suburbs on sunday and briefly 
manned the phones at his campaign headquarters in montgomery county 
this is george bush calling from the headquarters were 
trying to get the vote out i know you probably dont believe it 
but thats who it is the gop nominee said in one call 
bush also delivered a pep talk to staff members at the 
headquarters saying he and his wife barbara plan to keep 
running like were 10 points behind nobody is going to outwork 
us 
as part of a counteroffensive the dukakis campaign in missouri 
announced late sunday that a free lunch with the homeless will be 
held across the street from st louis union station at the same 
time as a bush rally today 
the lunch for clergy veterans the elderly and others is being 
sponsored by the st louis clergy coalition students for dukakis 
and other organizations the campaign said in a statement 
dukakis running mate sen lloyd bentsen was focusing today on 
his home state of texas where a statewide poll released this 
weekend showed bush maintaining a strong lead 
republican vice presidential nominee dan quayle was campaigning 
in michigan and ohio 
the latest nationwide poll a time magazine survey published 
today found the republican ticket leading dukakisbentsen by 10 
points 50 percent to 40 percent 
the survey of 1096 probable voters was conducted tuesday and 
wednesday and had a margin of error of plus or minus three 
percentage points 
bushs chief of staff craig fuller said the campaign thought 
the race would tighten in the closing days of the campaign 
i think its to be expected as you get to the final days of 
the campaign that youre going to see some tightening in this race 
but thats going to cause us to work harder fuller said 
buoyed by his campaigns tracking polls and some statewide 
surveys indicating a closer race dukakis claimed that the battle 
for the white house is far from over 
you can sense it you can feel it you can taste it he said 
crowds chanted give em hell and tell it like it is as 
the democratic nominee made his way through the california valley 
by amtrak train a cheer also went up when dukakis proclaimed 
himself a liberal 
in an interview with the macneillehrer newshour taped saturday 
and scheduled to air tonight the massachusetts governor said he 
was upset ith bushs definition of a liberal and the 
characteristics he tried to pin on his democratic rival 
the thing i object to is mr bushs use of the term in a way 
which i think is very deliberately designed to suggest that i and 
people like me dont have a sense of values that were kind of 
permissive that anything goes and anybody who knows me knows that 
thats the farthest thing from who mike dukakis is he said

poachers raided a special reserve at night 
and slaughtered at least five white rhinoceroses eliminating the 
animals from kenyas public lands authorities said monday 
the massacre by the 30 poachers occurred sunday night at meru 
national park east of snowcapped mount kenya and 140 miles 
northeast of nairobi the capital said minister of tourism and 
wildlife george muhoho 
five rhinos were killed he said several wildlife experts who 
spoke on condition of anonymity put the number at six 
thirteen elephants also were gunned down in the last week in 
different areas the wildlife sources said 
the killings came amid steppedup antipoaching efforts by the 
government since august when muhoho revealed the slaughter of 92 
elephants in the previous three months and the government launched 
a highly publicized campaign to stop the killing 
the white rhinos which unlike the black rhino are not 
indigenous to kenya were imported from south africa about 20 years 
ago and lived under guard in a special reserve in the park 
people watched over them day and night said one of the 
sources the rangers were wounded trying to defend them 
the poachers escaped after hacking off the rhinos valuable 
horns one rhino horn can sell for up to 24000 in the far east 
where it is used to make traditional medicines and in the middle 
east where it is fashioned into ornamental handles for daggers 
the white rhinos numbers have not been reduced as sharply as 
have those of the black rhino which were thought to number more 
than 60000 in the early 1970s today there are thought to be 
about 800 black rhino throughout africa 
most of africas white rhinos live in south africa where 
experts estimate the herd at about 3000 strong twentyfive to 30 
of the animals live in a private park in solio ranch near the 
equator southeast of mount kenya according to the daily nation 
newspaper 
both types of rhino are a rather dark gray with their visible 
differences lying mostly in horn size and lip shape 
kenya sent a paramilitary unit to meru national park to track 
the rhinos poachers said a government wildlife source he 
declined to provide details 
gunmen in the last week slaughtered and hacked the tusks off 
five elephants in southeastern tsavo east national park and eight 
elephants in the mathews range in arid samburu district 155 miles 
north of nairobi the sources said 
their deaths bring to about 150 the number killed since april 
according to published data wildlife officials estimate the toll 
is much higher 
studies by the nairobibased un environmental program show 
that in the past 15 years kenyas elephant population has dropped 
85 percent an aerial survey in february of tsavo park and its 
environs found less than 5500 elephants down from 35000 in 1974 
experts blame the intensifed slaughter on an alltime high of 
ivory prices which have climbed steadily since the early 1970s and 
average about 82 per pound

a firedup michael dukakis campaigned 
today as the political ally of women and young people and said the 
noisy welcome he received in california smells like victory to 
me 
taking a swipe at vice president george bush who rejected his 
invitation for an electioneve debate the democratic presidential 
nominee declared that you cant inherit the white house you have 
to earn the right to be president of the united states 
dukakis was greeted by loudly cheering supporters at the student 
union building at san jose state university on the second day of a 
campaign swing through a state with 47 electoral votes the most of 
any state 
it smells like victory to me he said 
dukakis campaigned sunday as a bornagain liberal but omitted 
the word from his san jose speech today when he referred to the 
heritage of presidents roosevelt truman and kennedy 
trying to attract wavering sources of traditional democratic 
strength dukakis said the republican ticket of bush and sen dan 
quayle of indiana had been on the wrong side of every issue of 
special importance to american women 
if people believed in such issues as pay equity health 
insurance and parental leave he said then were on your side 
he also said he was separated from bush by his stands on the 
environment and supreme court appointments 
dukakis quoted quayle as telling a 12yearold girl that if 
she were raped and made pregnant by her father the government had 
a right to force her to bear that child 
the audience erupted in loud boos 
as he left the building dukakis was cheered by several thousand 
people mostly students who stood outside the hall youre fired 
up he told them 
asked about his own mood dukakis replied im fired up 
as he toured the lush san joaquin valley by train sunday the 
massachusetts governor said confidently that his message is 
getting through and that this race is tightening up with 
polls showing he is narrowing bushs lead in several key states 
you can sense it you can feel it you can taste it he said 
campaign aides said an internal poll showed that bushs former 
10point lead in california had shrunk to a dead heat 
as he traveled by amtrak train dukakis predicted an upset 
victory on nov 8 and drew shouts of give em hell and tell 
it like it is from crowds that gathered under cloudless skies 
from bakersfield to hanford and then fresno merced modesto and 
stockton the train passed through the rich agricultural valley 
past fields of cotton and vineyards and orchards 
accompanying the candidate were sen alan cranston and reps 
tony coelho and robert matsui as well as a carload of financial 
contributors 
the pollsters and the press have been trying to tell us the 
election is over said cranston well show them on election 
day 
dukakis took up the same theme 
it wont be the pollsters and the pundits who vote on election 
day he said it will be you 
the candidate said his improved standing in polls is the result 
of work by a wonderful network of volunteers across the country 
and because our message of standing on the side of working 
americans is getting through 
suddenly he no longer shied away from the lword 
we need a president in the tradition yes the liberal 
tradition of franklin roois the outgoing vice president 
congress reasoned that a vice president only has to move down the 
hall 
regardless of who wins the transition headquarters will be 
ready for immediate occupancy by election day telephones will be 
installed copying machines will be plugged in and furniture will 
be in place 
stationery already had been ordered with a politically neutral 
heading of office of the presidentelect 
along with the government offices the building at 1825 
connecticut nw houses a drug store chinese restaurant and 
pakistani bank across the street is a bath house that once was a 
massage parlor 
representatives of the bush and dukakis campaigns have worked 
with the general services administration the federal housekeeping 
agency on arrangements in the building both say they dont need 
all of the three full floors and a part of a fourth that have been 
offered 
in the dukakis campaign transition director marcia hale has put 
her planning on hold as her candidate tries to stage a political 
comeback 
in the bush campaign where the rule is to avoid overconfidence 
transition director chase untermeyer is reluctant to talk about his 
months of preparation 
im in no position to answer because thats in the new world 
it wont dawn until after he bush happens to be elected said 
untermeyer who works out of the republican national committee 
headquarters 
if the polls are correct and bush wins he will face a situation 
that is unique in the last 152 years of political history 
not since 1836 has a sitting vice president been elected to the 
presidency that was when martin van buren moved up from understudy 
to president 
how would it affect bushs relationship with reagan would 
reagan begin to defer to bush who would be in charge 
the great historic example was in 1932 when the banking crisis 
was hard upon the land untermeyer recalled president 
herbert hoover asked presidentelect franklin d roosevelt what 
he aimed to do and roosevelt declined to answer because he felt 
that was improper that the president is the president until he 
leaves office 
obviously their relationship was marked by a great deal of 
bitterness because roosevelt trounced him during the election but 
that offer was declined untermeyer said 
even though there would be no bitterness between reagan and 
bush untermeyer noted that the presidentelect is the one who 
gets all the attention the incumbent president is the one that 
people have to be reminded of 
nevertheless untermeyer says the vice president has shown 
throughout his vice presidency that he has held the president in 
the highest esteem and honors him as the president of the united 
states and will until noon on the 20th of january 
and i cant believe that even though as history suggests the 
fullest brightest lights are going to be put on him bush during 
what they used to call the interregnum that he will in any way 
appear to take that light from the president until he himself is 
president said untermeyer 
however he said that if bush takes office on jan 20 it is a 
new administration it would not be ronald reagans third term 
it would be george bushs first term

siberia which the united states says violates the antiballistic 
missile treaty 
the delegations headed by william burns us arms control and 
disarmament agency director and viktor karpov the head of the 
arms control desk at the soviet foreign ministry met at the soviet 
diplomatic mission said a us spokesman speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
he said the meeting had been requested by the soviets and that 
the talks were expected to last a few days 
our purpose in these talks is to listen to the soviet 
proposals and to clarify soviet positions on actions that they are 
prepared to take to correct the krasnoyarsk problem said the 
spokesman 
the soviet government announced last week that it was giving the 
controversial radar site to the soviet academy of sciences for use 
as a civilianrun international space research center 
president reagan in a speech in los angeles on friday said the 
united states is listening to what the soviets have to say about 
krasnoyarsk but the us position remains unchanged

krasnoyarsk facility in order to comply with the abm treaty us 
officials maintain the radar violates the treaty which limits each 
sides antiballistic missile facilities because of its location 
and orientation 
the two sides met in geneva in august for their third periodic 
review of the treaty at the close of the oneweek session the 
us side issued a statement saying it ws not satisfied with the

the united states today relaxed trade travel 
and diplomatic restrictions against north korea to support south 
korean efforts at easing tensions on the peninsula 
state department spokesman charles redman said the united states 
will encourage unofficial nongovernmental visits from north korea 
in academics sports culture and other areas 
redman also said financial regulations are being revised to 
permit group travel by americans on a casebycase basis american 
diplomats will be allowed substantive contact with north korean 
diplomats for the first time in almost a year he said 
in addition the spokesman said commercial exports of 
humanitarian goods to north korea will be allowed on a limited 
basis currently humanitarian items must be donated 
redman stressed that general commercial trade will still be 
illegal and that north korea remains on our list of states which 
support or are engaged in international terrorism 
its behavior in this area is something we will continue to 
scrutinize closely he said 
the moves are a complement to efforts by south korean president 
roh tae woo who has called for a northsouth summit meeting and a 
resumption of trade between the two koreas as part of an attempt to 
ease tensions 
roh met with president reagan 10 days ago and suggested the 
united states act in coordination with south koreas own moves 
north korea is one of the few countries in the world with which 
the united states has no diplomatic relations and it has been the 
target of a highly restrictive us trade embargo 
in a gesture to the north in early 1987 the administration 
removed a prohibition on diplomatic contacts but then restored it 
after what officials said was convincing evidence of north korean 
complicity in the november 1987 bombing of a south korean passenger 
plane that killed all 115 aboard 
since rohs visit the state department has been working with 
the treasury department and other agencies to carry out the 
paperwork necessary to implement the expected changes the 
officials said 
historically south korea has with us help tried to isolate 
north korea but roh has altered that policy with his call for 
northsouth trade and for an unprecedented summit meeting with 
president kim ilsung 
as us officials see it rohs moves reflect increased south 
korean selfconfidence based on the countrys growing economic 
strength and the success of the olympic games held in september in 
seoul 
north korea made no attempt to disrupt the games which roh took 
as an encouraging sign he proposed the summit shortly after the 
games concluded reflecting in part strong domestic pressure to 
make an effort that could lead to the eventual peaceful 
reunification of the peninsula 
the officials said recent developments have left north korea 
more isolated than before its principal backers china and the 
soviet union ignored north koreas appeals for a boycott of the 
olympics 
only cuba and a handful of other leftist countries supported the 
north korean call

symbolized the struggle for free unions since the tumult of august 
1980 when a 36yearold electrician named lech walesa led the 
strike that created solidarity 
the yard once was a showcase of industry in communist poland 
but never recovered after the martial law crackdown of dec 13 
1981 that crushed solidarity the first independent union in the 
soviet bloc 
solidarity was recognized as a legal union after the 18day 
strike led by walesa who still works at yard named for the founder 
of the soviet state it was formally outlawed in 1982 and like the 
shipyard that spawned it never regained the power of that heady 
first summer 
officials now have decided to close the shipyard dec 1 citing 
the need to discontinue moneylosing state enterprises 
baltic coast shipyards have been hotbeds of political activity 
since the 1970s the killing by police of scores of workers during 
foodprice riots in december 1970 inspired a generation of workers 
to demand free unions 
the immediate cause of the 1980 strike at the lenin yard which 
began aug 14 was the dismissal in july of a popular woman who 
worked as a crane operator walesa who had been fired in 1976 
vaulted the fence into the shipyard to lead it 
soon after it was legalized solidarity claimed 10 million 
members including thousands belonging to the ruling communist 
party when it was banned in october 1982 solidarity maintained a 
leadership structure underground 
workers at the lenin shipyard joined strikes in may and august 
of this year the worst in poland since 1981 and authorities began 
to suggest closing the operation 
at its height of prosperity in the 1970s the yard employed more 
than 15000 workers a billboard on the grounds lists 27 countries 
for which it has built nearly 900 ships since world war ii 
much of its equipment has become rusted during the bad times 
and only about 10000 employees remain many ardent supporters of 
solidarity were fired or have drifted away since martial law to 
higherpaying jobs in construction or other fields 
a new generation of militant young workers has taken up the 
solidarity banner however pressing breadandbutter issues like 
pay and housing 
even when the shipyard is closed the site will remain a strong 
symbol of the free union outside the gates are three metal crosses 
130 feet tall erected by solidarity in its heyday to honor the 
workers slain in 1970

shadowy figures flit through the halls after 
dark burglar alarms go off for no apparent reason things go bump 
in the night 
sound like a halloween haunted house actually its the 
washington state historical society museum 
through the years nighttime security guards have reported 
ghostly figures stalking halls and noises in deserted parts of the 
museum which was built shortly after the turn of the century 
theres nothing worse than closing this place up at night 
said steve campion who works in the gift shop 
campion says any creaks and thumps probably come from settling 
of the building but he admits that he would be reluctant to spend 
a night in the place 
registrar mary rash said a security guard who retired in 1986 
often reported seeing a lady wearing a brown dress in the darkened 
hallways the same man who died the month after he retired also 
said he saw the ghost of mary todd lincoln playing with her two 
sons near an abraham lincoln display 
security officer michael shaudis said he was told that shortly 
after a new alarm system was installed several years ago a motion 
detector sounded an alarm in a locked room where the lincoln 
display was stored for reasons that remain unexplained 
ms rash hesitant to say she believes the museum is haunted 
nonetheless does not believe the guard fabricated his ghostly tale 
unexplained circumstances continue even with the latest 
technology 
images of victorianclad mannequins from a display somehow were 
burned into video security screens 
when a 3000yearold egyptian mummy known as ankh unnofoi was 
moved last fall from the firstfloor atrium to a dark cranny on the 
second floor to make room for another exhibit plans called for 
installation of a light at the new location the first light bulb 
fizzled so did the second 
a new lighting base and bulb were installed and all was well 
until the light was pointed at the mummy the bulb immediately went 
out shaudis said 
obviously its probably the contacts in the track he said 
nonetheless to this day the mummy remains unlighted

chinas first bankruptcy law takes effect 
tuesday creating a legal framework for closing thousands of 
inefficient staterun enterprises 
economists say that in its initial stages the law will be used 
more as a threat to debtridden firms and few will be closed since 
1986 when bankruptcy experiments started in several cities only 
two small stateowned businesses have been closed 
the new law is part of overall reforms designed to end lifetime 
employment tie wages and benefits to work performance and 
redefine the states relationship to business 
it was passed in december 1986 with the stipulation it would 
take effect three months after another new law which gives 
factories greater operating autonomy 
the bankruptcy legislation could affect the nearly 7000 
staterun companies running in the red 
these companies 17 percent of the nations staterun 
businesses lost almost 1 billion in the first half of 1988 up 
27 percent from the same period in 1987 the government will spend 
about 108 billion this year to prop up the ailing industries 
the bankruptcy law applies to firms that have suffered heavy 
losses but does not pinpoint which companies should be the 
target of closures 
under the law the state will auction off the fixed assets of 
enterprises declared insolvent efforts will also be made to merge 
money losers with stronger businesses the efficient firms will 
have the right to reassign workers or change the product line of 
the plant taken over 
the official china daily said sunday the introduction of 
bankruptcy once regarded as a symbol of capitalist decay is 
sending a shiver down the spines of directors and workers in 
moneylosing enterprises 
it quoted zhang yinjie of the beijing economic planning 
commission as saying his office was not sure how to determine 
what kind of enterprises should go bankrupt and then having 
decided that how to bring them to court 
zhang also brought up the labor issue saying what if the 
workers who have been fired throng around the government buildings 
raising signs and chanting i want to work i am hungry 
china which only recently acknowledged that unemployment 
existed in the socialist state puts unemployment at 2 percent 
chinese economists say the jobless rate will hit 4 percent or 5 
percent as factories trim excess laborers or go broke 
despite new statutes giving factory managers the right to hire 
and fire workers few people have lost their jobs and large scale 
layoffs are rare 
under an unemployment insurance program being tried in several 
cities enterprises pay into a relief fund and laidoff workers are 
eligible for benefits of 75 percent of their salary for the first 
12 months and 50 percent for the second 12 months 
china in the past month has called a temporary halt to price 
reforms and reasserted controls over bank loans and foreign trade 
in the face of a badly overheated economy and an inflation rate of 
more than 20 percent 
however chinese leaders insist they remain committed to the 
10year program of switching to an economy directed by market 
forces rather than central planning 
the government appears to be pushing ahead with measures to 
restructure the state ownership system such as the selling of 
shares in state factories auctioning off smaller state firms to 
collective or private businesses instituting the contract system 
and introducing bankruptcy

in this state infatuated with cars but 
infuriated by soaring auto premiums the insurance industry has 
raised a record 426 million for a campaign to defeat 
consumerbacked ballot proposals that would slash rates by at least 
20 percent 
the contest over five conflicting auto insurance reform measures 
on nov 8 ballots has grown into the most expensive political 
struggle ever waged outside a presidential contest 
all told a combined 60 million has been poured into a 
political war pitting consumer advocates insurers and trial 
lawyers against one another 
industry analysts express fears that support for the tougher 
ratecutting measures could spawn a nationwide insurance revolt 
more immediately if californians approve more than one of the 
five conflicting measures it could likely trigger court battles 
that would produce unexpected hybrids 
but polls show californians leaning toward approval of 
proposition 103 the deepest and broadest of the measures on the 
ballot 
proposition 103 supported by consumer advocate ralph nader 
would lower almost all rates by an immediate 20 percent below 
november 1987 rates it would require an additional 20 percent cut 
in insurance rates for good drivers 
it also would give an elected insurance commissioner control 
over future rate increases limit use of territorial rating to set 
auto insurance premiums and subject the industry to state antitrust 
and unfair business practice laws 
the rush to reform auto insurance was spurred by rates which 
have risen 40 percent between mid1985 and the end of 1987 
according to legislative studies 
the insurance industry claims its profits in the state are slim 
to none 
it placed rival proposition 104 on the ballot a 24000word 
measure that would create a nofault system temporarily cut 
personal injury premiums by an average 20 percent and prohibit 
recovery for painandsuffering damages unless injuries result in 
death or permanent and serious disability 
the key is getting a good nofault law passed and the bargain 
that the insurance industry is offering you is a good nofault 
law i think its a bargain you ought to strike with them 
says university of virginia professor jeffrey oconnell an expert 
on accident law who is backing proposition 104 
a second industrybacked measure proposition 106 would limit 
the contingency fees attorneys could charge their clients the fees 
are the payment an attorney gets from a settlement won for a client 
who cannot afford the regular payasyougo arrangement 
the industry says high contingency fees drive up insurance 
rates but foes say the measure would make it difficult for victims 
of accidents to hire qualified legal counsel while placing no 
limits on fees paid to lawyers working for insurance companies 
nader claims the insurance industry placed its rival measures on 
the ballot as a tactic to muddy the water 
when proposition 103 first hit the streets to get signatures 
to qualify it for the ballot the insurance companies realized 
they would have a very difficult time defeating it so they put 
their propositions on the ballot to confuse the public and their 
ads are furthering that end nader said 
adding to the confusion is proposition 100 financed largely by 
trial lawyers and sponsored by consumer groups which would 
immediately roll back good drivers rates by 20 percent below those 
charged on jan 1 1988 the measure also would prohibit limits on 
lawyers fees 
a fifth measure proposition 101 sponsored by democratic 
assemblyman richard polanco of los angeles and coastal insurance 
co would cut certain premiums by up to 35 percent by capping 
attorney fees and injury claims trial lawyers and consumer groups 
argue that the measure would leave loopholes for insurers to raise 
rates 
industry officials insist that propositions 100 and 103 would 
drive up rates in all but four southern california counties because 
companies could no longer use territorial rating and therefore 
would no longer be able to charge los angeles residents for the 
high cost of claims there 
proponents counter that their measures would not end territorial 
rating but would force insurers to justify it 
the industry also says many companies would abandon california 
in the face of rate cuts in propositions 100 and 103 but 
supporters term such threats scare tactics

thousands of farmers camped on a road to 
the presidential palace ended their weeklong protest monday saying 
the government will consider their demands for higher crop prices 
their withdrawal came soon after prime minister rajiv gandhi 
addressed a party rally in memory of his slain mother former 
premier indira gandhi 
the rally of the ruling congress party was to be held at the 
site of the farmers protest but was shifted to a park in front of 
the 17thcentury red fort about 3 miles from the presidential 
palace 
we have shown our strength said mahavir singh one of the 
farmers leaders who spoke to reporters as hundreds of tractors 
drove down the rajpath or avenue of kings and out of the city many 
farmers viewed their protest as a success because it forced a new 
venue on the congress rally 
mahender singh tikait president of the indian farmers union 
called off the protest he said the government has assured a 
farmers delegation that their demands will be considered 
police said at least 40000 farmers camped on rajpath since last 
monday most slept under the shade of their tractors by day and 
burned fires of cow dung to keep warm at night 
their protest became meaningless after they forced the 
congress to shift their rally said ajay aggarwal a police 
officer posted at the sitin site but the farmers say they will 
continue a noncooperation movement and refuse to pay taxes until 
government assurances become concrete offers according to mahavir 
singh among demands are that farmers get free electricity 
we are happy with what we have achieved singh said if 
the government does not honor its assurances we can always come 
back and if we come back we wont leave 
at least 500000 people gathered on the dusty grounds at the 
congress party rally 
during a 45minute speech delivered in hindi gandhi repeatedly 
told the crowd that his party had ushered in an agricultural 
green revolution and was trying to help farmers 
gandhi did not specifically refer to the farmers demands 
the rally was called to commemorate the fourth anniversary of 
the assassination of indira gandhi who led the party for nearly 
two decades

the failure of cuba and angola 
to respond to a usmediated compromise plan have delayed 
tuesdays target date to start granting independence to southwest 
africa reports said monday 
the independent south african press association said an official 
us announcement is expected to be made soon saying south 
africa would not meet its tuesday target to begin withdrawing from 
the territory popularly called namibia 
the withdrawal was to lead to june 1 independence elections 
supervised by the united nations which pretoria defied to continue 
its 73year rule of namibia 
south africa set the tuesday date and the governments official 
stance monday was that the target holds but it would not be 
responsible if other parties were not ready 
south african newspapers have reported recently that president 
pw botha is seeking to begin the independence process on jan 1 
1989 since it became clear tuesdays deadline would not be met 
were prepared to move at any time said louis pienaar 
south africas administrator for the territory 
but south africas proposal was contingent on an agreement for 
the departure of 50000 cuban troops supporting the marxist 
government in angola namibias northern neighbor 
south africa cuba angola and us mediators have held periodic 
talks since may but have been unable to set a timetable for cuban 
troops to withdraw no new date has been set to resume negotiations 
the south african agency said that in new york early this month 
us mediator chester crocker had asked for responses to the 
compromise plan by oct 12 crocker is undersecretary of state for 
african affairs 
south africa according to informed sources here met the 
deadline but the other two have not yet responded sapa reported 
from pretoria 
it said the us plan called for half the cubans to leave angola 
before elections in namibia and the remainder to move north of the 
15th parallel this would distance them from the namibian border so 
they could not support southwest africa peoples organization 
guerrillas who have been fighting south african rule for more than 
two decades 
the second stage sapa reported would involve reducing the 
cuban strength to onefourth its present strength by the end of the 
first year remaining cuban troops would leave by the end of the 
second year

the nations capital set a grisly standard 
monday when police recorded the 288th homicide of 1988 a city 
record for the most homicides in a single year 
the 288 deaths exceeded the previous mark of 287 homicides set 
in 1969 authorities blamed the upsurge in violence on drugs 
the latest victim was identified only as a hispanic male who 
died at about 6 am at washington hospital center according to 
shannon cockett a spokeswoman for the metropolitan police 
department 
it was not known how the man got to the hospital homicide 
detectives believed he may have been stabbed about 8 pm sunday 
no motive had been established 
police chief maurice t turner has blamed the high number of 
slayings on violent turf battles between drug dealers sixty 
percent of the years homicides have been drugrelated turner 
said compared with 33 percent as recently as 1986 
in the past couple of years jamaican drug gangs have 
infiltrated the washington metropolitan area local and federal 
authorities say turner said the turf battles have been exacerbated 
by the introduction of new drugs into the city 
this is one of the last major cities in this country to have 
an infusion of crack a highly addictive cocaine derivative 
turner said when crack arrived in other cities like new york 
murder rates went up there too 
most recently a drug combining marijuana pcp and cocaine has 
hit the streets fueling the wars 
its called beaming short for beam me up scotty ms 
cockett said referring to an expression from the old star trek 
television series 
turner over the weekend said officers still are not armed with 
9mm semiautomatic weapons to combat heavily armed drug dealers 
despite a promise he made eight months ago because no money in the 
citys fiscal 1988 budget was earmarked for the weapons 
but turner promised officers would be equipped with more 
sophisticated weapons within two years 
gary hankins chairman of the labor committee of the fraternal 
order of police blasted the department for failing to protect 
officers 
its ridiculous that it has taken the police department this 
long to develop specifications for a weapon that everyone agreed 
was urgently needed he said 
its a miracle that one of us hasnt already died because hes 
outgunned hankins said 
the 9mm semiautomatic weapons fire more rapidly than the 38 
caliber revolvers officers currently carry and allow them to fire 
an additional 10 bullets before reloading 
the district of columbias police force has been cut to 3800 
down from 5100 in 1977 but turner said more officers wouldnt

sixthgraders in the jackson school 
district will have a new kind of homework assignment this spring 
earn money to give to someone else 
the best program was created last year for 116 sixthgraders at 
raines elementary school where administrators feared students from 
deprived neighborhoods would be easy recruits for gangs and drug 
dealers 
we had a troubled group of sixthgraders last year they had 
low selfesteem no selfmotivation homework was just brought in 
in a sloppy manner raines principal rosalind hambrick said i 
knew that we had to try to do something for these children before 
they got away from us 
so we were looking for a counselor a mentor somebody 
anything we knew that frank melton general manager at wlbttv 
studios had done extensive work with gangs and troubled youth so 
we called the studio and his secretary said we ought to talk with 
dr yazdani 
nanolla yazdani a psychologist was working with melton on 
developing antigang programs for the city yazdani had gained 
international publicity after developing a program for firsttime 
nonviolent offenders at the misssissippi state penitentiary at 
parchman the prison program which he no longer oversees was 
patterned after army bootcamp right down to the spitpolished 
boots worn by the inmates and their rigorous regimen of 
calisthenics 
yazdani visited raines elementary and designed a program for 
sixthgraders this summer he trained teachers from 10 jackson 
elementary schools on his programs techniques 
this spring educators plan to expand the program to all sixth 
grades in the system 2562 pupils youngsters must have parents 
permission to take part 
meanwhile some teachers are already putting yazdanis 
techniques to work like sadie george who oversees an afterschool 
daycare program for pupils of all ages her students dont march 
like yazdanis prison recruits but they do sound out some strong 
cadences 
standing tall heads erect and hands behind their backs the 
youngsters repeat their rhythmic best program creed 
i am somebody i will never use drugs 
i am somebody what my mind can conceive 
and my heart can believe i will achieve 
i am somebody i will make you proud of me 
i am somebody i will do my work 
and i will love my fellow man i am somebody 
the best programs definition of being somebody includes the 
ability and willingness to do things for somebody else last year 
the raines sixthgraders held car washes then used the earnings to 
take pizzas to deaf students at nearby magnolia speech school 
the schools four sixthgrade classes worked as groups on their 
fundraising but individuals are encouraged to daily share their 
knowledge with others part of their homework is living the best 
program motto each one teach one 
each child is helped to identify knowledge and skills he can 
share hambrick said 
to do their best the children are taught to stick with a task 
until its completed take criticism and think creatively 
hambrick said she saw children disinterested in school become 
model students after yazdanis 20session program last year 
last spring sixthgraders scored an average of 65 in 
mathematics on the california achievement test compared to 58 
among sixthgraders at raines the year before in study skills 
scores went from 58 in the spring of 1987 to 68 this spring the 
principal said a score of 6 is indicative of expected sixthgrade 
work 
somebody asked me how is it that when they have to go back 
into the school room and they have to learn 10 spelling words why 
do they learn those 10 spelling words now 
i think it is because they have learned the value of learning 
the 10 spelling words its not because somebody tells them they 
have to learn the 10 spelling words hambrick said theyve set 
their own goals for themselves

president reagan today denied statements by 
hostage terry anderson on a videotape released by his kidnappers 
that his administration interfered with the release of hostages or 
bargained with terrorists 
i dont think that was terry speaking reagan said of the 
tape i think he had a script that was given to him 
when asked about the statement on the tape that the us 
government interfered when the hostages were about to be released 
reagan said that is absolutely not true but let me point 
something out terry anderson in that terrible confinement at the 
hands of those barbarians any information he has has to have come 
from there there is no contact with the outside world 
we have been doing everything we can for the release of the 
hostages and the very simple answer is for those people to let 
them go the president said 
reagan answered reporters questions after signing legislation 
clearing the way for us entry into an international copyright 
agreement 
there has never been any interference nor have we ever been 
negotiating any more than we would with any other kind of a 
kidnapper on a ransom type of basis he said 
when asked whether he thought the kidnapers were trying to 
influence the outcome of the us presidential election he said 
youd have to ask them i cant fathom their minds 
the president disputed a statement on the tape that vice 
president george bush was involved in negotiations with terrorists 
in the irancontra affair and a middle east twa hijacking 
nor was i because we were never doing anything of that 
kind he said 
when asked what he thought were the circumstances in which the 
tape was made reagan replied you have to remember these men 
are in the closest type of confinement you have to recognize 
that no hostage is taking something on himself theyre telling him 
what to do 
about prospects for the release of anderson and other americans 
held in lebanon the president said im not going to give up 
hope for any of our hostages that are held thats just too 
unthinkable 
but he said the one thing we cannot do is negotiate with the 
kidnappers on a sort of ransom idea because that just encourages 
more kidnapping and more hsotagetaking 
earlier reagans chief spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
release of the videotape was a cynical attempt to use the 
hostages to influence public opinion and the only real answer is 
for them to release the hostages immediately 
its not clear what they are trying to achieve but its 
obviously meant to influence the election eight days away he 
said 
in the tape released by his proiranian shiite moslem 
kidnappers anderson said 
i have been very close to being released several times over 
the past three years but each time it seems that the us 
government uses its influence to stop any agreement and i dont 
understand this 
fitzwater said that statement was simply not true 
anderson also urged the administration to negotiate his release 
and appealed to the new us president to end the plight of the 
hostages the reagan administration has said it wont negotiate 
with terrorists 
anderson said he was not asking reagan to deal with 
terrorists although mr george bush did so in the irancontra 
affair and twa hijacking he did not elaborate 
fitzwater said that statement was totally incorrect wrong 
he declined to elaborate saying he assumed the vice president 
would speak for himself 
fitzwater said the tape has some political statements in it 
that are cynical certainly and most unfortunate for the hostage 
families and for all of us who care about their plight 
asked whether he regarded anderson the chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press as cynical fitzwater said 
i think the hostagetakers are the kidnapers i dont think 
terry had much choice 
fitzwater said the statements in the tape are outrageous they 
are cynical they are an affront to the families of the hostages 
and to the american people

sears roebuck and co today announced plans to 
sell sears tower its corporate headquarters and the worlds 
tallest building as part of an effort to streamline the company 
sears restructing plan also will include a stock buyback 
intense costcutting programs and the sale of its commercial 
real estate subsidiary the nations largest retailer said 
we are acutely aware of investors desires for improved 
returns and enhanced share value edward brennan chairman and 
chief executive officer said in a statement and over the past 
year we have thoroughly evaluated all strategic and financial 
alternatives available to the company 
these alternatives have been reviewed not only with regard to 
shorterterm valuation objectives but also giving consideration to 
the longerterm needs of our customers and 526000 employees the 
financial strength of our company and fulfillment of sears 
longterm strategic potential brennan said 
the sears tower which rises 110 stories 1450 feet from the 
grid of the downtown loop business district was built in 1974 
the statement did not indicate how much sears hoped to get for 
the landmark building 
brennan said it would continue to serve as corporate 
headquarters for the company although the 8000employee sears 
merchandise group would be moved to smaller less costly facilities 
over the next several years 
the move would leave just 600 sears workers in the building 
officials said counting employees of both sears and other 
companies there are now about 13000 people working at the tower 
sears said it anticipated 425 million in expenses related to 
the sale of the building and other changes announced today and 
would deduct that amount from fourthquarter earnings 
however the company said it expected to add 340 million in net 
income for the year as a result of other accounting changes 
the stock buyback program will be aimed at acquiring up to 40 
million shares of sears common stock or approximately 10 percent 
of the companys 380 million outstanding shares 
the restructuring plan also calls for divestiture of the 
commercial division of sears coldwell banker real estate group 
redirection of its allstate business insurance division and 
strengthening of its financial services subsidiary dean witter 
reynolds inc with a greater commitment to consumerdriven 
activities 
the corporate moves to cut costs and redeploy assets will 
enable sears to compete more effectively and profitably in its 
merchandising insurance financial services and real estate 
businesses brennan said 
at a news conference today brennan was asked what message the 
restructuring plans were intended to send to sears huge number of 
customers the message is we are positioning sears strategically 
and financially for a period of unprecedented growth he said 
but sears stock declined 87 cents to 4275 a share in new york 
stock exchange trading today after the restructuring was announced 
speculation about a restructuring of sears have been circulating 
for months as have reports that the company was seeking to sell 
off several of its divisions 
last tuesday sears reported its thirdquarter net income fell 
16 percent from the yearearlier period marking the third 
consecutive quarter of declining profits it blamed the results on 
flat merchandise sales and intense competition from other retailers 
net income for the quarter totaled 3442 million or 90 cents 
per share for the three months ending sept 30 that compared with 
409 million or 108 a share for thirdquarter 1987

proiranian shiite moslem kidnappers 
today released a videotape of american journalist terry anderson 
who read a message accusing the us government of preventing his 
release 
copies of the tape were delivered to two western news agencies 
in beirut four days after anderson 41 spent a fourth birthday in 
captivity they were accompanied by a statement in arabic from 
islamic jihad which holds anderson 
in los angeles president regan denied his administration 
impeded the release of the hostages 
i dont think that was terry speaking reagan said of the 
videotape i think he had a script that was given to him 
he president added we have been doing everything we can for 
the release of the hostages and the very simple answer is for 
those people to let them go

were trying to influence the us election 
this is a cynical attempt to use the hostages to influence 
public opinion and the only real answer is for them to release the 
hostages immediately fitzwater said its not clear what they 
are trying to achieve but itss obviously meant to influence the 
us election 
anderson began his message which lasted two minutes and 35 
seconds by identifying himself and saying the date was oct 30 
once again i have been given the chance to speak to my 
government my family and my people said the chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press 
i love you i miss you very much i know of your continued 
strong efforts for me he told friends and family 
i have been very close to being released several times over 
the past three years but each time it seems that the us 
government uses its influence to stop any agreement and i dont 
understand this 
i am not asking reagan to deal with terrorists although mr 
george bush did so in the irancontra affair and twa hijacking 
he did not elaborate 
bush the republican candidate for president has not previously 
been named as a negotiator in the 1985 jet hijacking in which 
shiite moslems demanding freedom for shiite prisoners held 39 
americans for 17 days israel released 766 prisoners 
fitzwater said today that andersons statement about bush was 
totally incorrect wrong 
the vice president has said he was not a key player in the sale 
of arms to iran and was unaware of details and planning of it the 
deal became known as the irancontra affair when it was revealed 
that money for the arms was funneled to contra rebels in nicaragua 
our problem could have been solved a long time ago without 
such complications as arms deals anderson said 
he urged the administration to negotiate his release and 
appealed to the new us president to end the plight of the 
hostages the reagan administration has said it wont negotiate 
with terrorists 
it was the third videotaped message from anderson since his 
abduction in moslem west beirut on march 16 1985 the other tapes 
were released oct 3 1986 and dec 24 1987 
anderson is the longestheld foreign hostage in lebanon there 
are 14 captives including nine americans 
islamic jihad or holy war said in an accompanying statement 
that it provided the videotape on the occasion of terry 
andersons birthday and in response to your letters and according 
to his desire to send you a recorded message 
islamic jihad also holds thomas sutherland 56 of fort collins 
colo acting dean of agriculture at american university in beirut 
he was kidnapped june 10 1985 
the group is demanding among other things freedom for fellow 
holy warriors from all foreign jails and withdrawal of israeli 
forces from south lebanon it repeated those demands in a statement 
oct 23 
anderson appeared relaxed as he read from the prepared 
statement he was cleanshaven and wore eyeglasses his hair was cut 
short and neatly combed he was shown from the waist up wearing a 
striped gray sweater 
i am well and being well treated and i received your birthday 
greetings and as always i thank you very much he said 
letters from family members and colleagues appeared in beirut 
newspapers last week and staterun television broadcast a 
oneminute film thursday of andersons 3yearold daughter sulome 
singing happy birthday 
anderson said as my fourth birthday in captivity passes and 
the end of my fourth year in captivity approaches i find it 
difficult to keep my hope and courage high 
the news i hear tells me that i have not been forgotten and 
will not be but the difficulty seems enormous 
i heard on the radio of the generous and ambitious efforts to 
free three trapped whales a few days ago and the presidents thanks 
to the soviet union for its help it is a warming story he said 
that kind of cooperation and spirit is absolutely necessary to 
bring this situation to an end 
to his family he said peg madeleine and dad kiss my 
daughters for me keep your spirits up and i will try to do the 
same and one day soon god willing this will end 
the reference to dad indicates anderson does not know his 
father died in 1986 peg is peggy say andersons sister and 
madeleine is sulomes mother 
islamic jihad has freed three americans in the last three years 
the rev benjamin weir a presbyterian minister the rev martin 
lawrence jenco a roman catholic priest and david jacobsen former 
directer of the american university hospital in beirut

among the rileys gifts old books and a 1962 mechanical pencil 
all have been put on display

budget however guest said i really cant give a number 
because we may get one really valuable gift every five years 
some inkind gifts however do generate income

parents said judge heiner mueckenberger they are believed to be 
living in the west beirut neighborhood of bourj elbarajneh 
the trial which began july 5 has focused heavily on the shiite 
moslem hijackers childhood in wartorn beirut the parents 
testimony could help the court to determine hamadis age at the 
time the hijacking began 
court records show hamadi was born june 13 1964 which would 
make him 21 at the time of the hijacking hamadi has said he is at 
least two years younger 
on monday anthropologist manfred kunter 48 told the court he 
studied medical xrays of hamadi taken in saarlouis west germany 
where the defendant lived from 1982 to 1984 before returning to 
beirut 
the expert said he analyzed the development of hamadis elbow 
and his collarbone 
from the information i have studied i would say the birth 
year is 1965 plus or minus a half year kunter said 
depending on the courts decision on hamadis age his maximum 
prison sentence if convicted would range from 15 years to life in 
prison 
in other testimony monday psychiatrist andreas ploeger 
testified hijack victims often suffer longterm psychological 
disorders as a result of their ordeal 
ploeger told the court that one of the former victims of a 1977 
hijacking of a west german airliner still imagines being followed 
in a car by a hijacker 
hamadi who was arrested at frankfurt airport in january 1987 
after customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage 
told the court he had no comments on mondays testimony 
the defendant told the court in earlier sessions he took part in 
the hijacking but he has denied killing stethem 
the divers parents richard and patricia stethem have attended 
the trial regularly taking notes and listening attentively to the 
proceedings 
hamadis attorneys last week asked the court to suspend hearing 
more witnesses in the case until they can examine evidence compiled 
by the fbi in the united states the court has not yet ruled on the 
request 
court officials said monday that more former passengers on the 
hijacked flight were expected to testify this week

the yugoslav journalists union has 
sharply denounced political interference in the press and demanded 
greater freedom the official tanjug news agency reported monday 
journalists attending an annual conference in belgrade last week 
issued a statement saying the union is opposed to all pressures

the fish and wildlife service said monday it 
will prosecute 36 people in six states for trading in parrots 
illegally smuggled into the country 
us attorneys in indiana missouri illinois wisconsin texas 
and california have agreed to seek indictments against people it 
believes have been buying parrots from smugglers who sneak them 
across the mexican border near brownsville texas said megan 
durham spokeswoman for the service 
because indictments were still being sought she declined to 
identify the communities in which the defendants live two already 
have been sentenced to prison she said 
most of the defendants will be retail or wholesale dealers she 
said 
sellers of the birds she said chop down trees in central and 
south america to get baby birds and many of these were smuggled 
across the border as babies 
some of the birds are protected by a treaty which outlaws 
international trade in them without permission of both the 
exporting and importing countries or that outlaws trade in 
officially listed endangered species 
violation carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and 
a 250000 fine 
following a twoyear inquiry investigators concluded that as 
many as 26000 birds a year may be imported illegally the service 
said 
investigators seized planes vehicles and birds worth 468000 
these included the thickbilled parrot an endangered species in 
the united states and thus illegal to import and the black palm 
cockatoo and the scarlet macaw illegal to import without permits 
from the fish and wildlife service and the exporting country 
also the double yellowhead amazon parrot and the mexican 
redhead parrot which may not be imported without export permits 
from mexico in addition yellownape parrots and redlored parrots 
were seized because they were imported without undergoing 
quarantine ms durham said 
parrots may carry newcastles disease a highly contagious viral 
disease that can infect poultry the service said 
the service has received complaints of the illegal trade for 
some time but has had trouble making cases because dealers claimed 
their birds were bred in captivity in the united states service 
director frank dunkle said in a statement 
the illegal dealers commonly believed that once they got the 
smuggled birds away from the border they would not be caught 
dunkle said operation psittacine from psittacus latin for 
parrot is the first major covert effort by the fish and wildlife 
service to target illegal parrot dealers operating away from the 
borders

a hospital ignored state laws that encourage 
good samaritan acts by firing a dormitory housemother who gave 
shelter to a battered wife a lawyer argued monday 
the former housemother sallyanne brown is seeking unspecified 
damages and back pay from northeastern hospital in a civil lawsuit 
that went to trial monday in common pleas court 
mrs brown testified that she was fired from her parttime job 
as housemother at a dormitory for the hospitals female nursing 
students after she opened the dormitory doors late one night to a 
woman who was crying that she had been beaten by her husband and 
needed the police 
hospital officials testified that mrs brown was fired for 
violating rules that prohibited her from doing anything that might 
endanger the safety of the dormitory residents including admitting 
unauthorized visitors after curfew 
mrs browns lawyer judith chomsky argued that the hospital 
decision was based on an unreasonable fear that the woman posed 
a danger and that the hospital failed to give housemothers 
guidelines for handling emergencies 
during the opening arguments common pleas judge lawrence 
prattis said there was no question that state laws encourage giving 
assistance to abuse victims but said that does not provide an 
excuse for violating rules established by employers 
when mrs brown was on the stand prattis asked her if she would 
have let in a teenage boy who came to the door with bruises and 
said he was abused 
mrs brown said she would to which prattis replied i believe 
you would 
and that ms chomsky is your problem the judge said 
mrs brown also testified that a hospital security guard was 
present dec 13 1987 when she let the woman in and that the 
guard stayed until police came for the woman 
dr shirley hickman director of nursing education at the 
hospital said mrs brown would have been disciplined regardless of 
whether a guard was present 
ms hickman said the dormitory housemother has the 
responsibility for controlling who comes into the building after 
curfew and that hospital rules prohibited the entrance of 
unauthorized people 
ms hickman said she recommended that mrs brown be fired 
because of the rules violation and because she no longer trusted 
mrs browns judgment

the ruins of a castle owned by generations of a 
scottish kennedy family could have been king arthurs camelot a 
genealogist said monday 
greenan castle high on the ayrshire cliffs of southwest 
scotland was built on the site of a 6th century fort that 
matches almost exactly the description and location of a 
fortress in arthurian legend said harold brooksbaker 
although the story of king arthur and his court at camelot are 
legend historians believe there probably was a british ruler named 
arthur who fought saxon invaders from what is now the netherlands 
and the north german coast the shadowy figure was embellished by 
storytellers into a chivalrous hero slayer of monsters leader of 
the knights of the round table and seeker of the holy grail 
brooksbaker publishing director of burkes peerage said 
researchers had discovered the castle site was a key military post 
for king arthur and his knights 
they made the discovery he said while carrying out research to 
prove that the medieval scottish barony of greenan is an active 
title of nobility 
norma l goodrich of claremont calif a specialist in 
arthuriana carried out separate research into the forts history 
and believed it was one of arthurs six castles and the most 
important one from a military point of view brooksbaker said 
he quoted her as saying it was the custom of the king to 
refer to the castle he was using at the time as camelot in 
my opinion greenan was one of king arthurs forts 
the seventh marquess of ailsa archibald david kennedy wants to 
sell the barony including the castle site to somebody who will 
allow the historical research to continue brooksbaker said 
the title of baron is tied to ownership of the land and not to a 
blood lineage he said adding there was likely to be a blood tie 
between the scottish kennedys and the irish kennedy family from 
whom the late us president john f kennedy was descended jfks 
term often was referred to as camelot 
were trying to establish a blood relationship brooksbaker 
said

biotechnologists have produced a 
bacteria strain that could greatly increase the supply of ethanol 
a potential substitute motor fuel and reduce its cost the 
university of florida said monday 
for the first time bacteria have been genetically engineered 
so that they are now able to convert all types of sugars found in 
plant material into ethanol said lonnie o ingram professor of 
microbiology and cell science at the universitys institute of food 
and agricultural sciences 
ethanol is the principal octane booster used in premiumgrade 
gasolines replacing toxic lead additives and is considered a 
possible substitute motor fuel for the future 
ingram said he has changed the genes of a strain of bacteria to 
produce ethanol from a wider variety of substances 
further development of this process could cut the cost of 
ethanol production in half and eliminate dependence on cornstarch 
or cane sugar as a biomass source for ethanol fuel ingram said 
corn starch now represents about 80 percent of the expense in 
ethanol production the new process would allow the conversion of 
cheap biomass composed of diverse sugars into ethanol ingram said 
it is now possible to convert inedible vegetable waste 
stalks stems leaves and woody materials into ethanol a 
cleanburning fuel which can be used to reduce air pollution and 
our need for foreign oil he said 
ingram and his team are not the only scientists working on the 
ethanol problem but researchers have always failed to design a 
bacterium that can produce enough ethanol to make the process 
profitable 
if the florida work is to be a major breakthrough it will 
have to be rapid production with high concentrations of ethanol 
said henry bungay an ethanol expert and professor of chemical 
engineering at rensselaer polytechnic institute in troy ny 
bungay defined high concentration as above 4 percent that 
means at least 4 percent of the mass digested by the bacteria 
would have to be converted into ethanol 
we can achieve 4 percent without any trouble at all ingram 
said 
the development was made possible by cloning the genes for the 
ethanol digestive tract from the bacterium zymomonas mobilis and 
inserting these into the bacterium escherichia coli e coli 
the research is to be presented at the british society for 
general microbiology meeting in england in march 1989 the school 
said

a family who found asbestos insulation 
throughout their home cant sell the house cant afford to 
renovate it and contractors refuse to tear it down and their 
insurance company wont pay a penny 
the selphs have abandoned their home of 14 years and along with 
it most of their asbestoscovered belongings including toys 
furniture and their daughters college diploma even the vacuum 
cleaner had to be ditched 
all my pictures everything ive had since my kids were 
babies its all in there covered with asbestos carol selph 
said i feel like weve been living in pandoras box 
it will cost more to have the cancercausing asbestos removed 
than the 40yearold house is worth and their insurance wont 
cover anything because it doesnt cover that kind of contamination 
and the selphs cant sell the home unless the asbestos is 
removed 
contractors refuse to demolish the structure since workers would 
need to take special precautions and the hazardous materials cant 
be disposed of in the county landfill 
some people ask when well be moving back in but they dont 
understand the immensity of the problem mrs selph said the 
people in the community have been so nice to us churches have had 
fundraisers and offerings for us people have given us gifts 
furnishings and clothing 
asbestos was commonly used for insulation until the dangers 
became known but it was rarely used in the construction of homes 
no other homes in jasper have been found to contain asbestos 
its very unusual to find asbestos in the walls and ceilings 
of homes even homes built around that time said edward palagyi 
asbestos coordinator for the state department of environmental 
regulation 
when asbestos was used in homes palagyi said it usually was to 
wrap pipes 
the selphs troubles began in august when they had a heat pump 
and ventilation outlets put in 
i didnt know anything about it until two days after the 
system was installed and i asked a worker if they could repair some 
cracks mrs selph said he said he couldnt and then told me 
it was asbestos i was floored 
to install the heat pump and vents employees of kinseys air 
conditioning had to cut through walls and the ceiling that made 
the asbestos friable or flaking and the new system wafted fine 
asbestos dust throughout the house 
samples of the walls and ceiling were found to be 60 percent to 
65 percent asbestos and selphs were urged to move out 
we know its in our lungs no doubt about that mrs selph 
said but weve all had baseline chest xrays except my husband 
and everything looked fine 
the family now lives in a rented house a few miles outside of 
town they have hired an attorney in hopes of finding some way to 
pay for the asbestos removal

sen dan quayle made use of a line that 
was once used to belittle him diputing michael dukakis claim to a 
venerable liberal tradition by declaring that michael dukakis is 
no jack kennedy 
recalling the line that democratic vice presidential opponent 
lloyd bentsen used to slap him down in debate quayle charged that 
dukakis misled voters by identifying himself with such liberals of 
yesteryear as john f kennedy harry truman and franklin d 
roosevelt 
quayle seeking to solidify support in the midwest for himself 
and gop standardbearer george bush said that the massachusetts 
governor has finally resolved his identity crisis 
dukakis campaigning in californias central valley said sunday 
that we need a president in the traditon yes the liberal 
tradition of franklin rooosevelt harry truman and jack kennedy 
quayle commencing a weeklong series of appearances in the 
midwest and south told reporters that dukakis forgot to tell 
voters he is a modernday liberal like jimmy carter walter 
mondale and george mcgovern 
fdr liberals today are republicans the senator said saying 
that roosevelt truman and kennedy were prodefense and that 
latterday liberals have been relatively weak on national defense 
during his debate with bentsen earlier this month quayle said 
he had served about the same amount of time in congress before 
seeking national office bentsen in one of campaign 88s 
unforgetful putdowns retorted senator youre no jack kennedy 
quayle traveled to republican strongholds in western michigan 
and then went to ohio monday at the start of a campaign tour that 
will take him to kentucky tennessee louisiana north carolina 
missouri oklahoma and his native indiana by weeks end 
peter secchia the bushquayle chairman in michigan said the 
state remained pretty close its tightening up he said 
the gop ticket had a 9 to 11point public opinion poll advantage 
recently but that this margin has narrowed 
quayle standing next to jackolanterns and stacks of driedup 
corn stalks dwelled monday on dukakis newfound acknowledgment of 
democratic liberalism 
but he complained that dukakis wants to compare himself with 
kennedy truman and roosevelt instead of mondale carter and 
mcgovern 
hes a liberal but hes certainly not in the liberal mode 
of truman jack kennedy and fdr 
quayle said that rooosevelt had fought totalitarianism and 
that truman drew the line on the advancement of communism in 
korea he said that kennedy was able to stare down the soviet 
union in our own hemisphere during the cuban missile crisis 
kennedy campaigned in 1960 on a strong defense he campaigned 
on the missile gap quayle said 
mike dukakis is no fdr and for that matter i didnt know 
harry truman and i didnt serve with harry truman but michael 
dukakis is no harry truman either the senator said adding 
and yes i didnt know jack kennedy and i didnt serve with 
jack kennedy but michael dukakis is no jack kennedy quayle 
said his voice steadily rising 
the crowd packed into an airport hanger consisting mostly of 
young people broke into a bye bye mikie refrain along the 
lines of bye bye blackbird as quayle beamed broadly 
appearing before several hundred people gathered at a 
northcentral ohio ski resort later the senator continued to chide 
dukakis about the democratic partys past personalities 
how can the man who said our liberation of grenada was a 
misuse of power dare compare himself to the president who faced 
down the soviet union in cuba he said his idols should be 
candidates like george mcgovern who in 1972 wanted to cut 
americas defense by 30 percent 
if there were a law against impersonating americas heroes 
michael dukakis would be under house arrest quayle said

the supreme court examining macho 
attitudes in the workplace was told monday that employers should 
be under a heavy burden to disprove sexual stereotyping when 
charged with discriminating against women 
james heller representing a woman denied a partnership at one 
of the nations leading accounting firms said employers should be 
forced to show by clear and convincing evidence they did not 
practice bias 
otherwise heller said it will be impossible to pierce the 
impenetrable smog surrounding motives for hiring firing and 
promotion decisions made in the collegial atmosphere of 
business boardrooms 
but kathryn oberly a lawyer for the accounting firm price 
waterhouse said there was no solid evidence to show that sexual 
stereotypin caused the company not to grant a partnership to the 
former employee ann hopkins 
we have overwhelming evidence of legitimate motives ms 
oberly said 
she said lower court rulings in favor of ms hopkins were like a 
football game in which one side wins without even crossing midfield 
the plaintiff must bring the ball over the 50yard line ms 
oberly said 
the justices who heard 60 minutes of arguments in the case are 
expected to announce a ruling by july 
ms hopkins quit price waterhouse one of the nations big 
eight accounting firms after she was denied promotion to 
partnership in 1983 a move that would have made her a part owner 
she later became a consultant to the world bank 
ms hopkins had joined price waterhouse in 1978 and was 
nominated for partnership in 1982 the only woman among 88 
candidates for partnership that year 
she had been successful in getting business for the company 
winning government contracts worth between 34 million and 44 
million 
according to court documents both her critics and supporters at 
price waterhouse said she sometimes was overly aggressive too 
harsh impatient with her staff and very demanding 
one critic suggested she needed to take a course at charm 
school 
a partner who supported her for promotion told her she would 
stand a better chance of getting ahead if she would walk more 
femininely talk more femininely dress more femininely wear 
makeup have her hair styled and wear jewelry the documents 
said 
ms oberly said monday that the comment was made by ms hopkins 
strongest supporter at price waterhouse it was his personal 
reaction he was not the decisionmaker on her promotion she 
said 
there is no linkage between those comments and the alleged 
discrimination ms oberly said 
justice thurgood marshall asked whether there is any statement 
in the record rebutting the charge that she would do better by 
being less macho 
ms oberly said that was not the point of her argument 
thats my point marshall said 
justice sandra day oconnor back on the bench after breast 
cancer surgery 10 days ago also took an active part in questioning 
the lawyers 
she asked whether maybe the burden of proof shifts at some 
time to the employer to disprove sexual stereotyping charges 
ms hopkins sued price waterhouse on grounds it violated title 
vii of the 1964 civil rights act prohibiting onthejob 
discrimination she said sexual stereotyping unconscious or 
otherwise cost her a partnership 
professional partnerships are covered by the 1964 law under a 
1984 supreme court ruling 
the us circuit court of appeals in washington ruled in 1987 
that if there were mixed motives in denying ms hopkins a 
partnership price waterhouse was unable to prove that 
impermissible bias was not the determinative factor for the 
decision 
the appeals court ordered further hearings to determine what 
remedies were due ms hopkins and what the penalties should be 
against the accounting firm 
the case is price waterhouse vs hopkins 871167

when members of the acting company heard of john 
housemans death they were doing what they do for much of the year 
acting on the road 
the touring repertory company founded by houseman and margot 
harley was in missouri appearing in the 1940s comedy boy meets 
girl at the repertory theater of st louis 
the troupe of actors currently 10 men and five women was a 
special joy for houseman the author director actor and producer 
who died monday at the age of 86 
it was an idea born during housemans leadership at the drama 
division of the juilliard school in new york a job he held for 
eight years 
the idea of creating of a company out of a school really isnt 
a unique one harley said monday we hadnt planned to do it 
but our first class was so astounding they had created this 
incredible ensemble as well as being individually talented 
the seed for the acting company blossomed in december 1971 when 
fourth year students in the drama division presented a fourday 
festival of theater it was diverse program by the schools first 
graduating class and included such work as the lower depths 
the school for scandal women beware women and the indian 
wants the bronx 
the critics cheered and houseman decided to put into motion a 
plan that had been percolating in the back of his mind for some 
time a permanent touring repertory company made up of juilliard 
graduates 
the acting compay fulfills a very important dual function 
houseman said in an interview with the associated press four years 
ago it provides pretty good performances of important plays and 
does them all over the country even in places that never get any 
theater except what we bring them 
and it fulfills a secondary function which in a way has 
become equally important he said its a training ground for 
young star actors the results are extraordinary 
graduates of the acting company continue to make their mark in 
the theater movies and television the first troupe included patti 
lupone broadways evita and currently starring at lincoln 
center in a revival of anything goes kevin kline the dashing 
pirate king of the pirates of penzance and the looney con man 
of the film a film called wanda also was a member of the 
initial company 
today you can find other talented acting company alums 
everywhere like benjamin hendrickson a leading player on 
televisions as the world turns frances conroy in the latest 
woody allen film another woman and the new lincoln center 
revival of our town david ogden stiers also in the allen 
movie as well as a star at the old globe theater in san diego and 
lisa banes on broadway in neil simons comedy rumors

prices farmers got for raw products in october 
held steady at their latesummer level but still averaged 13 
percent more than they did a year ago the agriculture department 
said monday 
the departments agricultural statistics board said in its 
preliminary report that higher prices for oranges milk lettuce 
and corn were offset by lower prices for tomatoes apples eggs and 
soybeans 
meanwhile prices paid by farmers to meet expenses a figure 
computed only every three months rose 12 percent from july and 
averaged 55 percent more than a year ago 
farmers paid more for feeder cattle and calves than they did in 
july but feed and fuels were lower the report said 
prices received by farmers for some major commodities are based 
on midmonth averages and then are revised the following month when 
additional information is available 
the revised figures showed the leveling off actually began in 
september when the price index held steady at its august average 
the preliminary reading for october continued at the 
augustseptember level 
prices of raw farm commodities began rising in may as the 
drought worsened and continued climbing in june july and august 
an increase of about 11 percent from last april 
after holding steady during most of last winter the usda index 
rose 31 percent from april to may followed by june 22 percent 
july 29 percent and august 21 percent 
the drought and searing heat during the spring and summer cut 
1988 harvest prospects sharply and triggered the midyear price 
rise total us grain production is expected to be down 31 percent 
from last years harvest 
despite the leveling of the overall price index some 
commodities continued higher in october wheat for example rose 
an additional 14 cents per bushel to a us farm price average of 
389 per bushel the most since it was 395 in may 1981 
prices of livestock and livestock products as a group were 
unchanged from september although dairy products gained 31

7 percent

despite its traffic congestion smog 
ridiculously high housing prices and regulatory barriers los 
angeles rates as the best market for real estate investments a 
study said monday it listed houston denver and dallas among 
places to be avoided 
the pluses of los angeles and all of southern california 
economic diversity job growth climate quality of life and access 
to the pacific rim outweigh its minuses says the report 
indeed growth restriction is one of the things that attracts 
investors to california and to the other topranked areas the 
report says developers complain often bitterly of the hassles 
expense and risk but they are increasingly resigned to them and 
willing to accept the responsibilities in return for unsurpassed 
development opportunities less competition and upside profits 
the study drops new york from its most bullish list but 
retains washington and boston saying that housing costs in those 
cities are a barrier to continued high levels of commercial 
construction 
fewer and fewer people can afford to live in or near those 
centers and that will take its toll on economic expansion said 
the report new york is just too expensive and many firms cant 
justify the rent 
real estate research corporation which conducted the study 
said it sees new york as a premier market that will return to 
favor as its inherent strengths prevail over herd instincts 
the to be avoided list includes austin san antonio new 
orleans and tulsa 
any meaningful turnaround is still a year or so off in dallas 
and two to three years in houston the report said denver a 
much smaller market needs a yearortwo respite when it does come 
back it wont be to the level of the early 80s 
the study was done for equitable real estate investment 
management a property investment firm it said there are fewer 
best markets than in the past and that no city or region 
offers good prospects across the board 
here is what the report said of other cities as real estate 
investment opportunities 
phoenix overbuilt in every property type speculative 
samplfinanced land deals apartments and office space are in 
seriously long supply the phoenix economy is slow and steady 
resort pizazz notwithstanding and needs three years to rebuild 
enough momentum to justify new starts 
atlanta and chicago share the distinction of receiving about 
as many positive votes as negatives on the plus side the 
japanese have discovered both cities on the minus side huge 
quantities of office space hotel rooms and retail gla gross 
leasable areas are in place in the pipeline and on the drawing 
boards vacancies will increase in both chicago and atlanta 
major problems can be headed off only by disciplined cutbacks in 
new starts dont bet on that happening in either city

a soviet official said monday that claims against 
washington for delays in erecting the soviet embassy exceed the 29 
million america is demanding for an unfinished allegedly bugged 
us embassy building in moscow 
a swedish official said monday that the us claim will go to an 
arbitration board in stockholm which has quietly dealt with 
eastwest disputes for 20 years 
president reagan said last thursday he was recommending tearing 
down the main office building of the new us embassy compound in 
moscow because the building was riddled with soviet eavesdropping 
devices 
his administration is not permitting the soviets to occupy their 
new building in washington while the status of the us building 
remains unsettled 
soviet officials deny the us embassy building in moscow is 
bugged and on monday foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov told a news conference we also have bills to present 
to the american side 
gerasimov said claims for late delivery of construction 
materials and equipment and for other troubles would surpass the 
amount sought by washington 
in stockholm ulf franke vice chairman of the stockholm chamber 
of commerce said we have been informed by the united states 
that they are preparing an arbitration case here in stockholm 
the next step is to appoint the arbitrators 
the case is well prepared and it might start any day 
his organization is the parent body of the arbitration institute 
franke said the us government invoked a clause in the 1977 
building contract for the embassy construction in moscow in which 
either side can refer a dispute to the stockholm institute the 
ruling of the panel is binding 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said in washington 
that the us claim against the soviets is for damage and defective 
construction no figure has been established for any bugging of the 
building 
the state department has said the building will be torn down and 
a new embassy will be contructed with us workers and materials 
direct talks between the united states and soviet union have 
failed to settle the dispute us officials said last week they 
would ask outside arbiters to resolve it 
swedens arbitration institute was founded 70 years ago and 
began dealing with international cases in the 1960s its reputation 
for secrecy has brought it a growing number of cases 
the case will be heard by three arbitrators one chosen by each 
side and a chairman picked by the board from a list of leading 
swedish legal experts

afghan prime minister hassan sharq will 
visit the un this week and anticommunist rebels fighting 
afghanistans marxist government said monday they would send 
representatives to the world body 
the general assembly is expected to adopt a resolution welcoming 
the soviet troop withdrawal from afghanistan it has adopted 
resolutions annually denouncing the soviet intervention in 
afghanistan in 1979 but no debate is set on this years milder 
document 
sharq is not a member of afghanistans governing communist 
party and the soviet union has indicated he could be a compromise 
figure in a broadbased government 
but diplomats at the un speaking on condition of anonymity 
said pakistan and the united states which have supported the 
rebels find sharq unacceptable because of his association with the 
afghan government headed by najib 
the afghan mission said sharq would arrive tuesday and meet with 
un officials his schedule was not given but he is expected to 
address the us council on foreign relations in a closed meeting 
although not the general assembly 
burhanuddin rabbani chairman of a sevenmember guerrilla 
alliance announced in islamabad pakistan that the rebels would 
send a delegation to the united nations he reiterated that the 
rebels want to form an antimarxist government in afghanistan 
for the first time in nine years the general assembly will adopt 
a resolution on afghanistan by consensus not a divisive vote 
after the soviet union pakistan afghanistan and the united states 
agreed on the document diplomats said previous resolutions 
denounced the soviet military intervention and demanded the troops 
withdraw 
action on the afghan resolution is expected to be taken thursday 
sharq recently told reporters in kabul the afghan capital that 
both the governing party and rebels lack the trust of the people 
the soviet union repeatedly has accused pakistan of violating 
the unmediated afghanistan accords by continuing to arm and 
train the rebels 
the accords were signed last april 15 in geneva by afghanistan 
and pakistan with the united states and soviet union as guarantors 
the rebels did not take part but were represented by pakistan 
the soviet union intervened in afghanistan in december 1979 and 
at the time the accords were signed had more than 100000 military 
personnel there the agreements provide for the complete withdrawal 
of those troops by next feb 15 they also call for pakistan not t 
interference in afghanistans internal affairs 
on monday the 15member security council adopted a resolution 
confirming the formation of a 50member un observer force in 
afghanistan and pakistan to monitor the soviet troop withdrawal and 
check for violations 
afghanistan and the soviets have said the force is too small and 
that it has failed to investigate complaints charging pakistan with 
violations of the accords

house incumbents have a nearly 6to1 edge 
over their opponents in fund raising including a twelvefold 
advantage in garnering contributions from special interest groups 
a private study showed monday 
the study by common cause the advocacy organization that is a 
frequent critic of electoral activities illustrates one of the 
major reasons that there has been little turnover in the house in 
recent elections 
common cause president fred wertheimer said the incumbents 
fundraising edge is creating a challengerproof house of 
representatives and added the peoples body established by 
our founding fathers is starting to look like englands 
lifetenured house of lords 
common cause compiling house candidates campaign finance 
reports from jan 1 1987 through sept 30 1988 found that 
incumbents had raised 1369 million to 253 million for 
challengers during the period 
that included a 624 million to 53 million margin in funds 
contributed by pacs the committees formed by companies labor 
unions and other special interest groups 
incumbents had not only outspent their opponents by 92 million 
to 209 million but they also had a dramatic 793 million to 
36 million advantage in cash on hand for the campaigns final 
weeks 
of the 328 races in which a representative faces a major party 
opponent on election day incumbents had raised more money than 
challengers in 323 cases received more from pacs in 316 instances 
outspent their opponents in 315 contests and had more money left in 
320 races 
democratic and republican incumbents both enjoy mammoth 
financial advantages over their challengers although democrats 
who control the house and thus have more political power have the 
widest edge 
on average democratic incumbents raised more money in pac 
contributions than gop challengers by 166783 to 4724 
republican house members accepted an average of 132064 from pacs 
compared with 31408 received from pacs by democratic challengers 
of the 435 house seats 408 incumbents are seeking reelection 
including 80 who face no general election opponent from a major 
party 
in 1986 98 percent of the house members seeking new terms were 
reelected 
besides having an easier time raising money incumbents often 
represent congressional districts that were drawn to include large 
numbers of party supporters and in which the lawmaker already has 
name recognition they also make use of the perks of their jobs 
including their staffs and their ability to introduce bills and 
help constituents 
the 10 house candidates who raised the most money through sept 
30 are rep robert dornan rcalif 1286467 rep joseph 
kennedy dmass 1228525 rep joseph dioguardi rny

the government announced on monday a twoyear ban 
on killing or catching common seals in all british territorial 
waters with the same protection for gray seals in england and 
wales 
the order which goes into effect dec 1 provides a maximum 
fine of 1740 for anyone convicted of killing injuring or 
capturing the seals 
this reflects the high level of our concern about the 
diminishing seal population douglas hogg a junior home office 
minister told the house of commons 
it demonstrates once again the determination of this 
government to take decisive action to protect animals and in 
particular to conserve the stocks of gray and common seals he 
said 
hogg said the home office issued the order under the 
conservation of seals act 1970 following the recent threat to the 
british seal population by the caninetype distemper virus 
a mystery disease believed by scientists to be similar to the 
common cold or hoof and mouth disease killed thousands of common 
and gray seals in british and european waters earlier this summer 
lord sanderson minister of state for fisheries at the scottish 
office said the protection ordered for gray seals around england 
and wales was not extended to scotland because the situation there 
was less clearcut 
at this stage gray seals do not appear to be significantly 
affected and in any event they are currently offered protection 
until the end of the year under closeseason restrictions 
sanderson said 
hunting and trapping of gray and common seals the species most 
common in british waters has been legal but the season was closed 
for common seals from june 1 to aug 31 and from sept 1 to dec 31 
for gray seals

the search for a teenager suspected of 
slaying a college student whose body was found in her bathtub 
spread through new england monday as reported sightings flooded the 
police station of this wary town 
weve even had people call in sightings that turned out to be 
farmers walking down dirt roads and of one little girl on a road 
said police chief david mccarthy 
tensions had been running high for days in the town of 18000 
especially since published accounts quoting sources as saying the 
suspect had a fascination with a halloween horror movie 
a cinema agreed to suspend the showing of a new horror film 
halloween iv and selectmen voted friday to hold 
trickortreating in broad daylight sunday a day early 
mccarthy said he has sent out 1000 photographs of mark branch 
to other police forces in new england branch 19 disappeared 
shortly after the stabbing death of greenfield community college 
student sharon gregory 18 her body was discovered in her tub on 
oct 21 by her sister 
this subject should be considered armed and dangerous said 
a state police bulletin according to the recorder of greenfield 
info received indicates this subject may kill again 
the bulletin said gregory was stabbed in the back and head with 
a knife that mccarthy said has not been found he said gregory was 
not sexually assaulted 
the chief described branch as a loner he was a different type 
of individual adding a lot of people didnt like the kid 
he stressed however that investigators have found no link 
between branchs alleged taste for horror films and the slaying 
a state police investigator said sightings were reported as far 
away as enfield conn 50 miles to the south of the western 
massachusetts town 
police have searched for branch since his car was discovered 
abandoned on a back road in nearby buckland a day after gregorys 
body was found over the weekend however a manhunt in buckland 
was called off because 30 searchers and trained dogs turned up 
nothing 
i think it would be very reasonable to assume branch has gone 
from the area mccarthy said twentyfive hours elapsed between 
the time of the murder and the time we found his car 
newspapers have reported that branch was a fan of the friday 
the 13th movie series in which a character named jason committed 
a halloween night massacre and they cited unnamed sources as 
saying police found jason costume paraphernalia in branchs home 
including a hockey goalie mask and black boots 
police have refused to comment on their search and the search 
warrant they used has been impounded 
mccarthy said his detectives reviewed the friday the 13th 
movies to try to find a connection with the slaying 
police have no evidence that gregorys slayer may have acted as 
jason no paraphernalia left at the scene of the crime no notes 
nothing mccarthy said this was a brutal murder but it had 
nothing to do with any ritual involving satanism jason friday the 
13th 
mccarthy said he tripled the number of police cars on patrol for 
halloween but expected no trouble 
i spent four days trying to clear up the fear frenzy that has 
run rampant in this town he said i think by now the town has 
come off this fear thing

michael dukakis counterattacks have improved 
his rating as a crimefighter but the democratic presidential 
nominee still suffers from unsteady support within his own party 
polls said monday 
republican george bush led by 11 points among likely voters in a 
national survey by the gallup organization for the times mirror 
corp 5241 percent and by seven points 5245 percent in a poll 
by louis harris and associates 
the times mirror poll was done in the first half of last week 
the harris poll was more recent conducted friday through sunday 
its 5245 result was a very slight narrowing from 5344 in a harris 
poll conducted oct 1417 
dukakis only recently began to counter bushs charges that he 
was weak on crime and the harris poll indicated some results 
fiftythree percent rated dukakis soft on crime still high but 
down from 63 percent in the earlier poll 
harris also indicated that dukakis had scored slightly by 
portraying bushs campaign advertisements as unfair seventyfive 
percent called bushs ads too negative while 68 percent said the 
same of dukakis ads 
the times mirror poll meanwhile found support for dukakis 
uneven within his own party while bush marshalled monolithic 
backing from republicans and siphoned away some democrats 
gallup said the presidential race has been largely stable for 
months with bush ahead at least since september but its poll 
found an underlying factor in his favor his supporters were more 
loyal than they had been previously 
dukakis meanwhile has suffered slow erosion in his popularity 
to a point now lower than other candidates in recent years the 
poll said and he lost support in some democratic groups even while 
gaining it in others 
bushs lead was based upon overwhelming support from 
republicans solid backing from republicanleaning independents and 
substantial defections from some democratic groups according 
to gallups analysis of the results 
for dukakis on the other hand his support is not as strong 
among his own partisans and he is receiving virtually no 
defections from members of core republican groups the analysis 
said 
the survey did find some room for change swing voters those 
who were undecided or said they might change their minds made up 
27 percent of the likely voters and only about half of each 
candidates supporters backed them strongly 
the problem in analyzing the race was bushs stable lead on one 
hand versus the softness of both candidates support on the other 
if dukakis and the dukakis campaign can get their act together 
and speak to their constituencies or potential constituencies they 
can win it on the basis of the numbers said andrew kohut 
gallups president but thats a big if given the course of the 
campaign so far 
the times mirror poll divides the electorate into 10 evenly 
sized groups whose members share general values its partisan 
poor for example is a democratic group its enterprisers 
and moralists are republican 
bush attracted 21 percent of the partisan poor in the new 
survey significantly poaching in a democratic stronghold dukakis 
by contrast drew only 2 percent of the enterprisers and 3 
percent of the moralists 
the last timesmirror poll in september identified 
disaffected voters set apart by their suspicion of government 
as a swing group after a nearly even division in may they backed 
bush by 6127 percent last month 
in the new survey that preference held steady and bushs 
supporters in the group grew more loyal to him fiftyone percent 
said they were unlikely t switch to dukakis up from 36 percent 
last month 
in contrast on the democratic side defections to george bush 
have doubled among seculars and significantly increased among the 
partisan poor gallup said while dukakis offset the losses 
with gains in other democratic groups it said the movement was 
indicative of the problems that the dukakis campaign has had in 
achieving enthusiastic support from some groups within his own 
party 
additionally among all registered voters not just those likely 
to vote dukakis was rated favorably by 48 percent compared with 
58 percent favorable for bush the poll analysis said dukakis 
rating was significantly below those of most candidates in 
recent presidential elections 
the times mirror poll was conducted oct 2326 among 2006 
registered voters of whom 1505 were considered likely to vote 
the error margin for the likely voter group was plus or minus three 
points the harris poll was done among 1250 likely voters and also 
had a threepoint margin of error 
in a state poll monday abc news put the race in california at 
51 percent for bush to 44 percent for dukakis that survey was done 
saturday and sunday among 510 likely voters while the spread was 
within its margin of error of five points other recent polls also 
have found bush slightly ahead there 
in a separate poll in missouri bush led dukakis 53 percent to 
39 percent among 397 likely voters the poll was taken last monday 
through thursday and had a margin of error of four points

they were all there in spirit at johns 
grill sam spade nick charles and the continental op private 
eyes in a public place watching from the shadows monday as 
wouldbe writers played trickortreat with the ghost of novelist 
dashiell hammett 
the assignment was to hamup hammett san franciscos 
hardboiled gumshoeturnedmystery writer who gave us such 
treasures as the maltese falcon the thin man and the 
big knockover 
about 100 hopefuls entered this bad writing contest sending 
in sendups from vermont illinois washington florida and 
elsewhere they all ended up at johns a swell chop house in a 
notsoswell part of town 
hammett used to lap it up at the bar but he would have had a 
hard time swallowing the entries read on monday they were 
definitely not the stuff dreams are made of 
nick was the thinnest man norad ever seen handcuffs slipped 
from his wrists up over his head to encircle his waist hed gotten 
out of a lot of tight spots that way 
tell me the truth nora said when you were on the floor 
wrestling with mimi did you have anorexia 
oddly enough that kind of prose was good enough to tie kevin 
killian for first with william vlach both men are san franciscans 
both have real jobs and both want to be novelists 
killian got the nod for making an obscure pun when the thin 
man was first published in 1934 one line was deleted by censors 
nora really asked nick if he had an erection when he wrestled 
with mimi 
killian said his first novel is coming out soon 
vlach a psychiatrist by trade described a violent scene where 
brigid slams babe mcdougall on the back of his big head with a 
twobyfour leaving his right eye dangling out of its socket 
like something that cant be described in a family newspaper 
vlach went on nicely 
she turned to me the continental cop and said with a tear 
dribbling through her eye liner like moses parting the red sea 
you wont turn me in i love you you love me 
i counted the lies in those three sentences multiplied by 
three then opened the door for her pal little joel egypt when 
the cops got there i turned them both in her because she said she 
loved me him because he called me donald dick 
ok so these guys arent going to get pulitzers the grand prize 
package in this public relations gimmick was a bottle of cheap gin 
a ham sandwich and a hardboiled egg vlach and killian each got 
their own so they dont have to share but it didnt keep them 
from feeling like losers 
im pretty disappointed killian griped all i got was a 
bottle of cheap gin and a moldy old ham sandwich he apparently 
forgot about the egg and the free publicity 
nobody can say the judging wasnt fair although somebody 
probably will the three panelists were hal lipset a reallife 
detective whos cracked open more cases in 42 years than hammett 
could on a lost weekend don herron who has conducted walking 
tours through hammetts san francisco for the past 12 years 
and joe gores who wrote the novel hammett that inspired the 
1982 film of the same name

three planes within a 24hour period on sunday and monday to 
protest flight cancellations due to bad weather and equipment an 
official of the nations flag carrier said 
enrique santos philippine airlines vice president for public 
relations said in a telephone interview the incidents arose from 
the airport situation at the central city of bacolod about 300 
miles southeast of manila 
santos said several flights to bacolod had been canceled or 
delayed since october because some equipment there had broken down 
and would give incoming flights poor navigational aid 
he said the first of the three incidents occurred sunday in 
manila when a domestic flight bound for bacolod was canceled 
because of the weather 
upon being informed of the cancellation about 109 passengers 
led by an unidentified lawyer took over a plane scheduled to leave 
for davao in the south and demanded to be flown to bacolod he said 
the protesting passengers left the plane after 20 minutes when 
pal authorities assured their booking for another flight monday 
mondays flight left manila without incident but upon landing at 
bacolod the passengers refused to leave the plane and demanded 
that the airports radio and runway lights be repaired immediately 
the passengers left the plane an hour later after local 
officials assured them of action on their request santos said 
on a return flight to manila six passengers refused to leave 
their plane for an hour to protest what they deemed an apparent 
discrimination against bacolod airport they left after being 
told eight other domestic flights were canceled due to bad weather 
santos said 
santos said pal officials had not decided whether to file 
charges against the passengers

the oklahoma securities commission accused 
a defunct brokerage firm monday of using highpressure abusive 
sales tactics to persuade thousands of people across the country to 
invest in a scheme to turn sand into gold 
the securities commission estimated losses from the scheme total 
300 million nationwide and at least 4 million in oklahoma 
the commission is seeking to revoke the license of the tulsa 
firm of fitzgerald dearman and roberts and seven of its salesmen 
and principals said susan bryant administrator of the oklahoma 
department of securities 
the firms offices have been closed since june and liquidation 
proceedings are under way by the securities investor protection 
corp a federal agency that insures investor funds in the event of 
the failure of a brokerage firm 
the commission accuses the brokerage firm and the salesmen of 
using highpressure abusive sales tactics to promote stock in 
goldcor a florida company that claimed to have a secret process 
for turning black volcanic beach sand in costa rica into gold 
even though goldcor had no gold or other real assets the price 
of its stock rose on the overthecounter market from 3 to 6 cents 
per share when the scheme began in 1986 to about 11 per share 
before tumbling last february it is presently at 3 to 9 cents a 
share ms bryant said 
the precipitous drop followed a critical article in the business 
magazine barrons and a financial statement that showed goldcor 
had no revenues ms bryant said 
the real question is does this company have any real value at 
all she said at a state capitol news conference 
she said the 300 million in estimated losses was based on the 
peak price of goldcor stock before it began dropping in feburary 
probably thousands of people nationwide were touched by it in 
some way said ms bryant 
she said the securities exchange commission in florida has filed 
a civil lawsuit against goldcor but said she wasnt aware of any 
other action involving the company 
up to 14 firms besides fitzgerald dearman and roberts were 
selling goldcor stock at one time but these were the people who 
seemed to be pushing it above and beyond what they should have 
been ms bryant said 
ms bryant said the firms salesmen promised investors goldcor 
stock would double or triple in price suggesting they had insider 
information 
at least two of the 65 oklahoma investors identified so far were 
retired people who cleaned out their retirement accounts to invest 
in goldcor stock ms bryant said 
these were people who lost money who didnt have it to lose 
she said 
the commission said individual losses in oklahoma from the 
goldcor scheme ranged from 1000 to 450000 
in addition to revoking licenses the commission wants to bar 
the seven individuals from further associating with securities 
firms in the state 
the commission action monday amounted to a 15day notice of its 
intent to take administrative action 
well review the case to see if there should be a referral for 
criminal prosecution ms bryant said adding that it is a felony 
under oklahoma law to trade securities using false information

a civilian court stripped gen 
leopoldo galtieri the former military president of his rank 
monday and sentenced him to 12 years in prison for mismanaging the 
1982 falklands war with britain 
in partial confirmation of an earlier ruling by the highest 
military tribunal the federal appeals court gave the same sentence 
to the other members of galtieris junta adm jorge isaac anaya 
then navy commander and brig gen basilio lami dozo who was 
chief of the air force 
the military tribunals verdict automatically went for review to 
the civilian appeals court which can revise civilian or military 
judicial rulings and even act as a court of first resort 
defense lawyers said the convictions probably will be appealed 
to the supreme court 
judge horacio cattani president of the fourmember panel said 
all three officers were equally responsible for the mistakes 
omissions and negligence that led to defeat in the 74day war 
over the islands argentina calls the malvinas 
galtieri anaya and lami dozo constituted the third military 
junta to rule after president isabel peron was deposed in march 
1976 
appeals court judges acquitted three other officers who were 
instrumental in carrying out the war gens mario benjamin 
menendez and omar parada and vice adm juan jose lombardo all now 
retired 
the case stems from the juntas decision to invade the south 
atlantic islands april 2 1982 and the conduct of the war until 
menendez surrendered his troops on june 14 at stanley capital of 
the falklands 
in may 1986 the supreme council of the armed forces convicted 
galtieri anaya and lami dozo of negligence and incompetence 
sentencing them to 12 14 and 8 years in jail respectively and 
stripping them of rank menendez parada lombardo and seven other 
officers were acquitted 
cattani president of the appeals panel said sentences for the 
three junta members were made identical because doing otherwise 
risked inciting the protagonists in the case of a similar 
conflict to act independently losing sight of the fact that 
only a joint action would make possible a victory 
prosecutor luis moreno ocampo alleged when the appeal began july 
26 that the armed forces were illtrained poorly led and acted 
independently of each other 
he focused on anayas decision to withdraw the navy from combat 
after a british submarine sank the cruiser belgrano in may 1982 
and the failure of parada who commanded army troops on the 
islands to establish a command post 
officers called by the prosecution testified galtieri did not 
believe britain would fight to regain the islands or that the 
united states would help the british 
galtieri 62 claimed argentina almost won the war and charges 
of mismanagement were unfounded 
in an emotional defense oct 17 he said would i do it again 
given the same circumstances and conditions would i proceed in the 
same manner the answer is yes i lt gen galtieri would proceed 
the same way as i did 
argentina has claimed the islands since 1810 the year it 
asserted independence from spain britain has ruled them since 1833 
the chilly windswept archipelago is home to about 1900 
sheepherders and fishermen possession conveys rights to natural 
resources including abundant fishing fields and possible oil 
deposits

the democrats are touting recordbreaking fund 
raising for the 1988 election with 50 million but they still 
havent caught up to the traditionally richer republican party 
the republican national committee and its statebased victory 
88 program have raised some 92 million finance director phil 
smith said monday 
the democratic national committee announced it has surpassed its 
fundraising goal of 50 million at 503 million the most the 
national party has ever raised for an election in 1984 the party 
raised 24 million said spokeswoman julie anbender 
both parties have engaged in an allout effort to raise 
socalled soft money which consists of contributions that would 
not be allowed in the federal election process but can be used by 
the parties for generic and staterelated election activity that 
ends up indirectly benefiting the presidential candidates 
for candidates seeking election to the presidency or congress 
the law limits individual contributions to 1000 and bars 
corporate and union funds all of which can be accepted by the 
parties themselves 
in the general election no private contributions are permitted 
for presidential candidates because they receive 46 million from 
the taxpayersupported public fund to wage their campaigns 
in addition each national party can spend 83 million on its 
presidential nominee 
the parties are collecting millions on top of that 
robert farmer head of the democratic partys victory fund 88 
said the partys 50 million had come from 325000 donors with an 
average contribution of 154 
however the party also received contributions of 100000 or 
more from 142 individuals said anbender 
direct mail brought in some 300000 a day for 18 million of 
the 50 million total the party said in a news release while more 
than 75 large fundraising events brought in another 18 million 
on the republican side more than 125 contributors gave 100000 
or more as part of the team 100 program said smith 
the republicans victory 88 program in which money goes 
directly to statelevel party organizations has surpassed its goal 
of 25 million raising 27 million so far smith said 
gop nominee george bush and his running mate sen dan quayle 
have helped that fund substantially by appearing several times a 
week at highticket fundraising events out on the campaign trail 
smith said rnc mail in the past two weeks has produced more than 
300000 a day with an average 25 contribution he called it a 
boom the likes of which he has not seen since 1980 
its been very easy to raise money since august he said 
contending that people are reacting out of fear of what they 
foresee as bad economic conditions should democratic nominee 
michael dukakis win the election

gov mario cuomo ordered monday that all 
problem place names that represent racial ethnic or religious 
epithets be eliminated from new york state maps 
an executive order from cuomos office directed that all state 
agencies refer potentially offensive geographical names to the 
state committee on geographical names and he said derogatory names 
should be eliminated from maps prepared for and by the state 
derogatory names have no place in the empire state and we 
must act at the state level to ensure that such names are removed 
forever from the maps new yorkers use cuomo said 
cuomo took the action in response to the longtime use of 
nigger swamp on us geological survey and new york state 
department of environmental conservation maps to a region of 
washington county along the shore of lake champlain 
the region was so dubbed in the 1830s according to legend 
after a black barge worker suffering from smallpox was put ashore 
there to die 
the use of that term by dec officials who said the area would 
be stocked with pheasants was news to cuomo when reported last 
month by the new york post 
obviously we didnt know about this cuomo told the 
newspaper and now that we do know we will do everything possible 
to get rid of this ugly reminder of a time when people were less 
intelligent than they are now 
his order does not affect mapmakers outside state government 
the committee on geographical names was created by the state 
board of regents to establish correct place names in new york 
based on historical and etymological considerations

a woman who admitted plotting a toy 
giveaway with some of the 71 million stolen from wells fargo in 
1983 was sentenced monday to five years in prison 
luz berrios berrios 38 an occupational therapist from puerto 
rico received the maximum prison term but was spared a 10000 
fine for her guilty plea in september to a charge of conspiracy to 
transport stolen money 
us district judge t emmet clarie said a fine would be 
pointless because this lady is indigent for all intents and 
purposes 
her attorney jacob wieselman asked that berrios be sent to the 
federal minimum security prison in danbury noting that she is just 
a few weeks pregnant and needs to be near her family 
but clarie said that because berrios is pregnant the best 
prison for her would be in lexington ky the judge however said 
he would let wieselman see if arrangements could be made at danbury 
on the day a jury was to be picked for her trial berrios 
admitted to conspiring with others in puerto rico to send between 
5000 and 12000 to hartford to pay for toys given away on jan 
6 1985 three kings day the day when people in many latin 
american countries traditionally exchange gifts 
she said she presumed the money was from that stolen on sept 
12 1983 from the wells fargo depot in west hartford in the second 
largest cash heist in us history 
the government contends that berrios is a leader of los 
macheteros a terrorist group seeking puerto rican independence 
the group has claimed a role in attacks on us installations in 
puerto rico 
berrios husband juan e segarra palmer who prosecutors say is 
a key defendant in the wells fargo robbery and four other men are 
now on trial before clarie 
nine others are awaiting trial on charges in the robbery one 
other defendant has pleaded guilty

border troops killed 14 venezuelan 
fishermen at a weekend picnic mistaking them for colombian 
guerrillas the government said monday 
two fishermen escaped the saturday morning attack by diving into 
the arauca river and swimming a halfmile to a ranch near the 
border town of el amparo sources there said 
the venezuelancolombian border incident the bloodiest in 
years took place at guafitas 360 miles southwest of caracas 
interior minister simon alberto consalvi said the victims were 
peaceful venezuelan fishermen not members of colombias 
national liberation army as the defense ministry originally stated 
president jaime lusinchi has ordered a wide summary 
investigation into the incident consalvi told the associated 
press on monday 
grimelda de marquez an el amparo government official said in a 
telephone interview the fishermen carried no weapons at all at 
most some had just knives as any ordinary fishermen do 
they were going to have a chicken stew when soldiers started 
to fire they were all honest people 
she quoted the two survivors jose hugueto arias and vollmer 
gregorio pinilla as saying the 14 bodies were bulletriddled 
beyond recognition 
other sources in el amparo speaking on condition of anonymity 
quoted the two as calling the shooting a land attack supported 
from the air a slaughter of defenseless peaceful people who 
were sailing toward the beach on a weekend picnic 
gen humberto camejo arias who commands the special border 
security force was quoted in press accounts immediately after the 
killing as saying the group had been armed with light submachine 
guns explosives and grenades a list of possible kidnap targets 
and a map of venezuelan oil installations in the area 
he was quoted as saying the victims were allegedly members of 
the national liberation army a leftist colombian guerrilla group 
pinilla and arias were transfered under police custody on monday 
from el amparo to police headquarters in neighboring san cristobal 
400 miles west of caracas and will give testimony in san 
cristobal the sources reported 
consalvi blamed the shooting on a lamentable confusion on 
the part of the troops who are responsible for guarding the river 
border against incursions into venezuela by colombian guerrillas 
this is the only explanation we have for now he said 
earlier monday the defense ministry said 16 colombians were 
killed but two bodies had yet to be found and 14 were still being 
identified 
a ministry spokesman said monday the men were part of a group of 
about 50 who were crossing the arauca to enter venezuela from 
colombia 
venezuela can pump up to 52000 barrels per day of oil from the 
area and last year completed an oil pipeline from guafitas to a 
small refinery 90 miles north at san silvestre 
venezuela increased its border security in february in response 
to a rise in kidnappings of its citizens by alleged colombian 
guerrillas

third televised debate on election eve next week 
instead bush suggested that dukakis debate himself the new 
left vs the old left 
dukakis vs dukakis it should be an entertaining debate 
the vice president said in rallies in st louis and louisville ky 
bush said the dukakis who now calls himself a liberal could 
debate the earlier one who shunned the l word which bush and 
president reagan have used repeatedly to taunt the massachusetts 
governor 
faced with an apparent narrowing of his lead over dukakis in 
several major states bush appealed for the support of disenchanted 
democrats he borrowed a phrase made popular by former president 
nixon in calling them the silent majority 
as the presidential campaign entered its final week the gop 
nominee wasted no time in poking fun at his democratic rival for 
embracing liberalism sunday during a campaign tour of california on 
sunday and dismissed dukakis challenge to join him in an 
hourlong debate the night before the nov 8 election 
an election eve debate read my hand gesture that says it 
bush told reporters accompanying him on air force two in a 
paraphrase of his read my lips no new taxes line 
the vice president held up one finger then two to indicate the 
two previous presidential debates in winstonsalem nc and los 
angeles in late september and midoctober 
speaking to a rally in the commonwealth civic center in 
louisville bush asked his audience to remember how dukakis 
jumped all over me for using the lword in their second debate 
well yesterday miracle of miracles headlines read all 
about it hes using the liberal label again bush said 
suggesting that dukakis debate himself the gop nominee said 
one could claim to be on the side of ordinary americans and 
the other could explain whether he thinks ordinary americans oppose 
the death penalty for drug kingpins like he does favor weekend 
furloughs for convicted murders oppose asking for a requirement 
for teachers to lead the kids in the pledge of allegiance 
he repeated those lines at a subsequent rally in the remodeled 
union station in st louis adding that at the end the moderator 
should say will the real governor of massachusetts stand up 
bush boarded a train for a fiveminute ride into the cavernous 
openair station where he addressed several thousand people from a 
platform he shared with an oversized pumpkin with bushquayle 
88 carved in its side 
were in a horserace bush told the crowd i wont settle 
for anything less than a firstplace finish 
in louisville bush said he could now use the l word freely 
and declared that we cannot let the naive disarmers and the 
nuclear freezers back into the white house 
in his appeal to what he called abandoned democrats bush 
said the democratic party had moved away from mainstream america 
so my pitch here in the last eight days is to those good 
democrats the rank and file he said i tell them have hope 
have confidence 
kentucky where local polls show bush enjoys a doubledigit 
lead has nine electoral votes missouri where polls show the race 
to be much closer has 11 electoral votes 
at another pep rally in kansas city mo bush said told the 
crowd we are involved in a tough race and repeated his pledge 
to campaign as if the republican ticket were 10 points behind in 
the polls 
i dont care what these polls show he said 
the vice president planned to spend most of the week campaigning 
in large midwestern industrial states before heading for california 
lee atwater bushs campaign manager said the vice president 
planned to spend much of his remaining time in dukakis 
mustwin states 
if you and your opponent are in his base states then thats a 
sign youve met your goals and he hasnt atwater said in an 
interview 
he said bush running mate dan quayle would continue to campaign 
in our base states 
meanwhile the bush campaign distributed a 348page compilation 
of the vice presidents campaign speeches bearing the title 
leadership on the issues in an apparent effort to blunt 
criticism of negative gop campaign advertising attacking dukakis 
bush stood by a stack of the books at the st louis rally and 
said this is what the campaign is about not those tv ads 
at least one of the bush speeches reprinted in the book had been 
sanitized the vice presidents highly publicized misstatement 
about pearl harbor day occurring on sept 7 instead of dec 7 
during a speech before the american legion in louisville does not 
appear in the books version of the speech

democratic underdog michael dukakis made 
a populist pitch for the support of women and young voters monday 
and said his boisterous reception smells like victory in the 
nov 8 election 
he won cheers from an audience at san jose state college for 
stands on abortion the environment and economic opportunity and 
drew loud approving boos when he lambasted republican rival george 
bush and his running mate dan quayle on the same issues 
but dukakis refrained from using the word liberal until a 
later appearance at cerritos community college in los angeles 
where he cloaked himself in the liberal tradition of great 
presidents like franklin roosevelt and harry truman and john 
kennedy 
dukakis started using the word sunday in california defiantly 
proclaiming himself a liberal bush had repeatedly taunted dukakis 
with the l word during the fall campaign saying the democrat 
has tried to hide his leftward leanings 
dukakis aides also released a text of a fiveminute commercial 
to be broadcast tuesday night on nbc in it dukakis refers to 
roosevelt truman and kennedy as well as lyndon johnson 
this election has always been an uphill fight dukakis says 
in the ad but about some things im as stubborn as my critics 
say and im determined that in the intense days of this last week 
we will continue to see the truth and to speak it 
he also criticizes the tone of the republican campaign saying 
they are running for the highest office in the land by waging the 
lowestlevel campaign in modern history 
at the san jose appearance he invoked the names of those three 
presidents as having provided a caring government and caring 
political leadership said dukakis thats the kind of 
president i want to be 
its halloween today isnt it the democratic nominee 
reminded his noisy campus audience in this environmentally 
sensitive state with its biggerthanany prize of 47 electoral 
votes 
mr bush is going to be passing himself as an 
environmentalist no treat for us thats the biggest trick in the 
book dukakis said 
he reaffirmed his opposition to oil drilling off the california 
coast and said the reaganbush administration had the worst 
environmental record in the history of this country 
he went on the counterattack against bushs criticism of 
pollution in boston harbor 
im not the guy who polluted boston harbor dukakis said 
im the guy whos cleaning it up no thanks to mr bush and his 
friends 
making his first major appeal to women voters a traditional 
source of democratic strength dukakis said the republican ticket 
had been on the wrong side of every issue of special importance 
to american women 
he said that if voters believe in comparable wages for both 
sexes affordable child care and parental leave laws then were 
on your side dukakis then dropped his voice when he spoke of 
abortion 
dukakis shook his head when he said quayle had told a 
12yearold girl last week that if she were raped by her father and 
became pregnant the government had a right to force her to bear 
that child 
the overflow san jose audience of several hundred people erupted 
in loud boos 
quayle made no mention of the government when he answered an 
11yearold girls question in illinois last week about his advice 
in such a situation quayle responded that he favored childbirth 
over abortion even under those circumstances 
dukakis said his republican opponent wanted to outlaw abortions 
i believe a choice that personal must be made by the woman in the 
exercise of her beliefs dukakis said 
he turned to his student listeners and quoted kennedys words 
during a 1960 campaign visit to california you have to decide 
which candidate reflects your judgment of our country of its needs 
and of its future dukakis said 
dukakis boasted that he was narrowing bushs onceformidable 
lead in the polls and said there is a feeling in the air and it 
smells like victory to me 
he challenged the vice president again to join him in an 
hourlong nationally broadcast debate on election eve next monday 
night 
you cant inherit the white house dukakis said youve 
got to earn the right to be president of the united states 
bush dismissed the invitation during a campaign appearance in 
louisville ky mockingly suggesting that dukakis debate himself 
in a matchup of the new left vs the old left 
dukakis headed for los angeles and ohio a midwestern industrial 
state where the democratic nominee also hopes to overtake bush by 
election night

a rally monday on the yale campus by a 
group of students alumni and faculty calling themselves yalies 
against bush was disrupted by a spirited contingent of bush 
backers who swarmed around speakers who took turns attacking the 
vice president 
as students carrying bushquayle signs worked their way to the 
front of the crowd supporters of michael dukakis responded in 
kind crowding closer and closer to the speakers until they were 
completely surrounded 
yale police attempted in vain to get the competing camps to pull 
back 
about 200 people attended the rally and the proximity of the 
crowd to the speakers made it difficult to hear the speeches from 
any distance 
the bush supporters occasionally heckled but did not prevent 
members of yalies against bush or john dukakis the democratic 
presidential candidates son from delivering their speeches 
when speakers finished their remarks and yalies against bush 
responded with go duke and other chants the bush supporters 
some of whom remained at the back of the crowd yelled four more

members of congress have told the president of 
turkey that a meeting with austrian president kurt waldheim would 
damage turkish ties with the united states 
at the same time a turkish official said his government asked 
waldheim to stop in istanbul rather than in ankara the capital so 
as not to make his visit appear official 
waldheim had asked to stop in ankara and see president kenan 
evren on his way home from the middle east said the official who 
declined to be named but turkish authorities informed waldheim 
that evren would not be in ankara that day and asked the austrian 
to stop in istanbul instead 
that way it doesnt seem like an official visit he said 
in a telegram to president evren six members of the house 
subcommittee on europe and the middle east said they were 
appalled and shocked at the news that kurt waldheim will be 
received by you early in november 
waldheim who has been shunned by western governments because of 
accusations that he facilitated nazi war crimes in world war ii is 
scheduled to stop in turkey on wednesday en route home from a 
middle east visit 
the american people and the american congress have expressed 
their view of waldheim by banning him from even visiting the united 
states the telegram said 
we wish to see turkishus relations strengthened and 
receiving waldheim would have a very negative effect the 
lawmakers said the six representatives were tom lantos dcalif 
benjamin gilman rny lawrence smith dfla mel levine 
dcalif edward feighan dohio and gary ackerman dny 
their subcommittee headed by rep lee hamilton dind 
oversees the administrations policy toward turkey and recommends 
to congress the amount of aid the nato ally receives each year 
despite intense state department efforts aid for turkey has 
been reduced steadily by congress in recent years the 
administration asked for 9149 million for turkey in fiscal year 
1988 but only got 5253 million 
several members of the senate including rudy boschwitz 
rminn and carl levin dmich sent cables and letters to 
turkish ambassador sukru elekdag urging his government to 
reconsider its hosting of waldheim 
meanwhile waldheim was greeted monday in kuwait with a red 
carpet welcome and 21gun salute at the start of his threeday 
state visit he had just completed a fourday visit to syria 
the topics for discussion in kuwait were expected to be the same 
as those in syria the middle east peace process the situation in 
the persian gulf since iran and iraq stopped fighting bilateral 
relations and key international issues officials said 
the justice department last year placed waldheim on a list of 
people banned from the united states after reviewing evidence that 
linked him with nazi atrocities when he served as an officer in the 
german army occupying the balkans 
in ankara the foreign ministry described waldheims visit as an 
unofficial stopover foreign minister mesut yilmaz will greet 
waldheim at the airport in istanbul and evren will host a luncheon 
for him later in the day

michael dukakis counterattacks have improved 
his rating as a crimefighter but the democratic presidential 
nominee still suffers from unsteady support within his own party 
polls said monday 
republican george bush led by 11 points among likely voters in a 
national survey by the gallup organization for the times mirror 
corp 52 percent 41 percent and by seven points 52 percent 45 
percent in a poll by louis harris and associates 
the times mirror poll was done in the first half of last week 
the harris poll was more recent conducted friday through sunday 
its 5245 result was a very slight narrowing from 5344 in a harris 
poll conducted oct 1417 
dukakis only recently began to counter bushs charges that he 
was weak on crime and the harris poll indicated some results 
fiftythree percent rated dukakis soft on crime still high but 
down from 63 percent in the earlier poll 
harris also indicated that dukakis had scored slightly by 
portraying bushs campaign advertisements as unfair seventyfive 
percent called bushs ads too negative while 68 percent said the 
same of dukakis ads 
the times mirror poll meanwhile found support for dukakis 
uneven within his own party while bush marshalled monolithic 
backing from republicans and siphoned away some democrats 
gallup said the presidential race has been largely stable for 
months with bush ahead at least since september but its poll 
found an underlying factor in his favor his supporters were more 
loyal than they had been previously 
dukakis meanwhile has suffered slow erosion in his popularity 
to a point now lower than other candidates in recent years the 
poll said and he lost support in some democratic groups even while 
gaining it in others 
bushs lead was based upon overwhelming support from 
republicans solid backing from republicanleaning independents and 
substantial defections from some democratic groups according 
to gallups analysis of the results 
for dukakis on the other hand his support is not as strong 
among his own partisans and he is receiving virtually no 
defections from members of core republican groups the analysis 
said 
the survey did find some room for change swing voters those 
who were undecided or said they might change their minds made up 
27 percent of the likely voters and only about half of each 
candidates supporters backed them strongly 
the problem in analyzing the race was bushs stable lead on one 
hand versus the softness of both candidates support on the other 
if dukakis and the dukakis campaign can get their act together 
and speak to their constituencies or potential constituencies they 
can win it on the basis of the numbers said andrew kohut 
gallups president but thats a big if given the course of the 
campaign so far 
the times mirror poll divides the electorate into 10 evenly 
sized groups whose members share general values its partisan 
poor for example is a democratic group its enterprisers 
and moralists are republican 
bush attracted 21 percent of the partisan poor in the new 
survey significantly poaching in a democratic stronghold dukakis 
by contrast drew only 2 percent of the enterprisers and 3 
percent of the moralists 
the last timesmirror poll in september identified 
disaffected voters set apart by their suspicion of government 
as a swing group after a nearly even division in may they backed 
bush by 6127 percent last month 
in the new survey that preference held steady and bushs 
supporters in the group grew more loyal to him fiftyone percent 
said they were unlikely t switch to dukakis up from 36 percent 
last month 
in contrast on the democratic side defections to george bush 
have doubled among seculars and significantly increased among the 
partisan poor gallup said while dukakis offset the losses 
with gains in other democratic groups it said the movement was 
indicative of the problems that the dukakis campaign has had in 
achieving enthusiastic support from some groups within his own 
party 
additionally among all registered voters not just those likely 
to vote dukakis was rated favorably by 48 percent compared with 
58 percent favorable for bush the poll analysis said dukakis 
rating was significantly below those of most candidates in 
recent presidential elections 
the times mirror poll was conducted oct 2326 among 2006 
registered voters of whom 1505 were considered likely to vote 
the error margin for the likely voter group was plus or minus three 
points the harris poll was done among 1250 likely voters and also 
had a threepoint margin of error 
in a state poll monday abc news put the race in california at 
51 percent for bush to 44 percent for dukakis that survey was done 
saturday and sunday among 510 likely voters while the spread was 
within its margin of error of five points other recent polls also 
have found bush slightly ahead there 
in a separate poll in missouri bush led dukakis 53 percent to 
39 percent among 397 likely voters the poll was taken last monday 
through thursday and had a margin of error of four points 
in wisconsin a survey of 1019 likely voters sunday through 
thursday found bush leading 4540 the survey had a margin of error 
of three points

a church leader gave salvadoran 
rebels a report monday on proposals for a negotiated solution to 
their 9yearold war with usbacked governments of el salvador 
arturo rivera damas roman catholic archbishop of san salvador 
said the proposal was based on observations about the political 
social military and economic situation from more than 60 
salvadoran organizations 
rebel leader joaquin villalobos said the farabundo marti 
national liberation front the umbrella organization for five 
salvadoran guerrilla groups considered the report positive because 
it demands an end to the war and the reasons that led to it 
he and rebel representative leonel gonzalez added however that 
reopening talks with the government would be difficult 
rivera damas presented the report on what he called a national 
debate during a ceremony at a military installation attended by 
gen manuel antonio noriega panamas military commander and de 
facto ruler 
villalobos and gonzalez met with noriega and later said they 
briefed him on visits by rebel representatives to peru argentina 
ecuador and costa rica to promote a negotiated settlement 
they said rebel officials would return to those countries to 
inform the government leaders of their meeting with the archbishop 
rivera damas said the report contained 140 ideas offered by the 
60 organizations in several days of meetings with church leaders 
but he gave no details 
salvadoran church leaders have mediated the few meetings between 
the government and rebels and frequently urge that talks resume 
the last meeting was oct 20 1987 in san salvador the capital of 
el salvador 
gonzalez said the report can reactivate the peace process 
but another round of talks with the government of president jose 
napoleon duarte isnt easy now 
negotiations in el salvador are quite complicated gonzalez 
said the americans oppose them duarte opposes them parts of 
the private sector oppose them so we have to build relations among 
forces to open negotiations 
he said the rebels have set no preconditions for talks but 
rejected previous government demands that the rebels lay down their 
weapons 
we have given them the message that we are ready to talk with 
all social forces including the army that we are ready to talk at 
any place or time gonzalez said 
the one thats established conditions is the government he 
said duarte has said that in order to talk again with the fmln 
rebels front we have to put down our arms this is absurd its 
inadmissible 
venceremos the clandestine rebel radio said monday that 
salvadoran rebels had killed the mayor of a small town in morazan 
a western province in the war zone the army said 53 rebels and 29 
soldiers were killed in several skirmishes in october

a federal adoptahorse program that is 
supposed to protect wild horses and burros is actually sending some 
of them to slaughter a federal appeals court said monday in 
upholding restrictions on the program 
the bureau of land management renders the adoption process a 
farce by failing to screen out owners whose intention is killing 
the horses for use as pet food said the 9th us circuit court of 
appeals 
the 30 decision prohibits the blm from transferring title of 
any wild horse or burro to a person who is known to intend 
commercial exploitation slaughter or use in a rodeo 
the court did not say what steps the government agency must take 
to learn the intent of a wouldbe owner but the ruling was hailed 
by animalrights organizations who filed the lawsuit 
we were determined from the start that the blood money of 
these national treasures as the wild and freeroaming horse and 
burro act defined these animals should not end in the hands of 
already amply paid profiteers said writer cleveland amory 
founder and president of the fund for animals one group involved 
in the lawsuit 
he said it was also important that the court had recognized the 
right of animalrights organizations to challenge the blms 
management of animals 
craig james a lawyer for amorys group said the blm reportedly 
has suspended its adoption program and replaced it with other 
protective measures such as a sanctuary for wild horses 
but he said the ruling could determine the fate of many of the 
estimated 8000 wild horses that have been adopted in the last 
year under a blm policy challenged in the lawsuit the agency does 
not not inquire as to the intentions of an adopter who has taken 
humane care of a horse for a year 
the heaviest population of the horses is in nevada but james 
said they can be found over a wide area west of the rocky mountains 
a 1971 federal law which described the wild horses as living 
symnbols of the historic and pioneer spirit ordered protective 
measures for the animals on public lands 
later laws set up the adoption program in which people could 
pay the government 125 per horse and 75 per burro for the right 
to tame up to four animals for riding or make other uses of them 
the blm is allowed to transfer ownership of an animal to an adopter 
who has assured humane treatment and has taken good care of the 
animal for a year 
animal rights groups filed suit in 1985 after the blm said it 
would waive fees for animals that were considered unadoptable 
in response to the lawsuit the blm conceded that it had allowed 
adoption of horses by some people who intended slaughter or other 
commercial exploitation 
but the government agency argued that it was within its 
authority since another federal law allowed the humane destruction 
of wild horses that cannot be adopted 
that authority has never been used however and was suspended 
by congress this year the court said 
in upholding a ruling by us district judge howard mckibben 
the appeals court rejected the blms argument that it can transfer 
title to anyone who has taken proper care of a wild horse for a 
year regardless of future intentions 
the agencys disregard for the announced future intentions of 
adopters undercuts congress desire to ensure humane treatment for 
wild horses and burros said the opinion by judge herbert choy 
in fact it renders the adoption process a farce for the 
oneyear requirement of humane treatment and care serves no purpose 
if on the day the oneyear period expires the adopter can proceed 
to the slaughterhouse 
the court did not say whether the blm had the authority to waive 
adoption fees

american hostage terry anderson in a 
videotape released monday by his kidnappers read a statement that 
accused the reagan administration of blocking his release and urged 
the next president to do more 
president reagan denied interfering with efforts to free 
anderson and his chief spokesman marlin fitzwater denounced the 
tape as a cynical attempt to influence the nov 8 election 
copies of the 2minute 35second tape were delivered to two 
western news agencies in beirut four days after anderson 41 
marked his fourth birthday in captivity 
statements from the proiranian islamic jihad which holds 
anderson accompanied the tapes 
on the occasion of terry andersons birthday and in response 
to your letters and according to his desire to send you a recorded 
message we hereby enclose with this statement the recorded message 
on videotape the kidnappers said 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press began the message by identifying himself and saying the date 
was oct 30 
once again im being given a chance to speak to my family to 
my friends and to the american people he said 
anderson said his spirits were boosted by the birthday greetings 
he received but as my fourth birthday in captivity passes and as 
the end of my fourth year in captivity approaches i find it 
difficult to keep my hopes and my courage high 
ive been very close to being released several times over the 
past two years but each time it seems that the us government 
uses its influence to stop any agreement from being made and i 
dont understand this 
in los angeles reagan told reporters his administration had 
done everything possible to win the hostages freedom i dont 
think that was terry speaking he said i think he had a script 
that was given to him 
when asked about the statement on the tape that the us 
government interfered when the hostages were about to be released 
reagan said that is absolutely not true but let me point 
something out terry anderson in that terrible confinement at the 
hands of those barbarians any information he has has to have come 
from there there is no contact with the outside world 
we have been doing everything we can for the release of the 
hostages and the very simple answer is for those people to let 
them go the president said 
anderson said i gather theres been very little discussion 
about this problem in the us presidential campaign and thats 
disappointing as is president reagans complete failure to find a 
solution during his eight years in office 
but whichever candidate wins this election remember an 
unyielding refusal to deal with this matter is not going to make it 
go away it is not going to free us 
he urged the next president to use his influence in a positive 
way not a negative one to end his plight 
of the two candidates anderson singled out vice president 
george bush 
im not asking president reagan to deal with terrorists 
although both he and mr bush did so in the irancontra affair and 
the twa hijack the message said 
bush has not been named previously as a negotiator in the 1985 
jet hijacking in which shiite moslems demanding freedom for shiite 
prisoners held 39 americans for 17 days and killed a us navy 
diver 
the vice president has minimized his role in the sale of arms to 
iran the deal became known as the irancontra affair when it was 
revealed that money for the arms was funneled to contra rebels in 
nicaragua 
fitzwater said the comments about bush were totally incorrect 
wrong 
anderson appeared from the waist up he was dressed in a gray 
track suit and read the statement in a steady voice he was shaven 
his hair was combed and he wore glasses he said he was being 
treated well 
it was the third videotaped message from anderson released by 
the islamic jihad which kidnapped anderson on march 16 1985 he 
is the longestheld of the 14 foreign hostages nine are americans 
the previous two messages were released oct 3 1986 and dec 
24 1987 
in addition to anderson islamic jihad holds thomas sutherland 
56 of fort collins colo he was acting dean of agriculture at the 
american university of beirut when he was kidnapped june 19 1985 
islamic jihad has freed three american hostages in the last 
three years the rev benjamin weir a presbyterian minister the 
rev martin lawrence jenco a roman catholic priest and david 
jacobsen former director of the american university hospital in 
beirut 
jacobsens release on nov 2 1986 was linked to the us arms 
sales to iran 
our problem could have been solved long ago without such 
complications as arms deals anderson said in his message 
i heard on the radio of the generous and ambitious efforts to 
free three trapped whales a few days ago and the presidents thanks 
to the soviet union for its help it is a warming story he said 
that kind of cooperation and spirit is absolutely necessary to 
bring this situation to an end 
the tape ended with a message to his family peg madeleine 
dad kiss my daughters for me keep your spirits up and i will try 
to do the same and one day soon god willing this will end 
anderson has two daughters gabrielle 13 and sulome 3 the 
reference to dad indicated anderson does not know his father 
died in 1986 
peg referred to his sister peggy say and madeleine is 
madeleine basil the mother of sulome 
mrs say in batavia ny on monday said she continues hoping 
for andersons release but has given up criticizing federal policy 
against conceding to her brothers kidnappers 
you come to a place where you understand that when a horse 
dies you get off it she said the hostages are not a great 
enough number to excite the masses 
but if there were a plane load of americans she asked 
would we allow our president to not lift a finger

the intense twoweek takeover battle for kraft 
inc was rather like the storm before the calm as analysts said 
monday they expect philip morris cos inc to make few changes in 
the company it is buying for 131 billion 
i suspect well have kraft left alone for a year said 
ronald b morrow who tracks both companies for the investment firm 
smith barney harris upham amp co 
diana temple an analyst with salomon brothers inc agreed 
saying it appears that both companies will be run separately 
morrow based his prediction on philip morris history when 
they bought general foods they left it alone for two years he 
said referring to the 1985 purchase of another major us food 
manufacturer 
philip morris executives did not seek changes in general foods 
until the division began having problems morrow noted adding that 
he did not anticipate similar steps to be taken at kraft 
kraft manages their business better than general foods does 
he said 
in fact philip morris might draw on krafts expertise to help 
general foods sales and earnings growth which have flagged in 
recent years there are more problems at general foods that kraft 
could fix morrow said 
kraft and philip morris announced sunday that they had signed an 
agreement under which philip morris would boost its tender offer 
for all of krafts outstanding stock to 106 a share from 90 the 
kraft board said it was recommending shareholders accept the deal 
it appeared monday kraft investors would enthusiastically 
endorse the acquisition the companys stock soared 7 a share to 
10350 on the new york stock exchange philip morris rose 62 
cents a share to 9537 
kraft had bitterly opposed as inadequate the initial 90ashare 
offer philip morris made oct 17 kraft then unveiled a defensive 
restructuring that would pay stockholders a package of cash and 
securities that kraft valued at 110 a share 
after negotiations friday in chicago company officials worked 
out a preliminary agreement that the kraft board approved at a 
meeting in new york philip morris chairman hamish maxwell said 
the acquisition the largest combination of nonoil companies 
in the united states would fulfill philip morris goal of 
reducing its dependence on revenue from its slowing cigarette 
business it also would become a tougher competitor against other 
giant multinational corporations like unilever the giant 
anglodutch concern that philip morris will displace as the worlds 
biggest consumer products company 
it will boost philip morris sales from about 30 billion in 
1988 to 455 billion in 1989 ms temple predicted adding that 
the combination will boost nontobacco operations to up to 35 
percent of sales 
the acquisition would add wellknown kraft labels such as 
velveeta processed cheese parkay margarine philadelphia cream 
cheese miracle whip salad dressing and sealtest ice cream to 
popular philip morris brands like miller beer marlboro cigarettes 
jello and maxwell house coffee 
the combination also would create the worlds second biggest 
food products operation after switzerlands nestle sa 
in washington dc sen howard m metzenbaum said monday he 
has asked the federal trade commission to launch an antitrust 
investigation of the deal metzenbaum dohio said the resulting 
company would be so large it could seriously affect competition and 
raise the prices of prepared foods 
metzenbaum is chairman of the senate judiciary subcommittee on 
antitrust monopolies and business rights 
ftc spokesman howard shapiro said the agency would not comment 
on whether it was looking into the merger 
maxwell said there were no plans to sell any major kraft assets 
while the analysts expected kraft and general foods to exist as 
separate entities for the nearfuture they said they did not 
expect the honeymoon to last forever 
it would make sense if they were combined because the new 
company could save on manufacturing distribution and 
administrative costs morrow said

president reagan on monday rejected as 
absolutely not true charges that he and vice president george 
bush made deals with terrorists and deliberately thwarted the 
release of hostages held in lebanon 
responding to allegations read by american hostage terry 
anderson in a new videotape released by his proiranian captors in 
lebanon reagan said i dont think that was terry speaking i 
think he had a script that was given to him 
reagan was asked about the tape at a ceremony where he signed 
legislation that offers us artists and writers copyright 
protections under an international treaty 
on the twominute 35second tape anderson the chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press voiced a statement 
accusing the us government of preventing his release the 
statement also accused bush of having dealt with terrorists in the 
1985 hijacking of a twa jetliner and in the irancontra arms deal 
another allegation reagan denied 
bush interviewed on the nbc nightly news said i had no role 
that you are aware of or not aware of absolutely in the twa 
hijacking negotiations 
the republican presidential candidate also said he was a 
little bit optimistic about their letting these hostages out i 
think with iraniraq having a ceasefire i think its in irans 
interest though they dont hold the hostages to do what they can 
to encourage their release i think it would set whoever is elected 
president a good tone for the possibility of improved relations 
earlier white house spokesman marlin fitzwater had denounced 
the kidnappers accusing them of a cynical attempt to use the 
hostages to influence the us presidential election 
contrary to many instances in the past the president spoke at 
length with reporters about the latest hostage tape reagan 
appeared eager to discuss the matter and stepped up to the 
microphone to answer reporters questions 
queried whether the us government had interfered when the 
hostages were about to be released reagan said that is 
absolutely not true but let me point something out terry anderson 
in that terrible confinement at the hands of those barbarians 
any information he has has to have come from there there is no 
contact with the outside world 
reagan insisted that his administration has been doing 
everything we can for the release of the hostages and the very 
simple answer is for those people to let them go 
there has never been any interference nor have we ever been 
negotiating any more than we would with any other kind of a 
kidnapper on a ransom type of basis he said 
when asked whether he thought the kidnappers were trying to 
influence the outcome of the us presidential election he said 
youd have to ask them i cant fathom their minds 
reagan then went on to dispute the charge on the tape that bush 
was involved in negotiations in the sale of arms to iran and in 
resolving the 1985 middle east hijacking of a twa jet navy diver 
robert stethem was killed by the hijackers during that ordeal 
nor was i because we were never doing anything of that 
kind reagan replied 
asked again if bush had played a role in negotiations for the 
release of the twa hostages reagan launched into a spirited 
defense of his vice president saying george has been a part of 
everything weve accomplished ive always felt that a vice 
president should be an executive vice president as in a 
corporation and not somebody sitting over on the sidelines waiting 
for me to have a relapse 
reagan went on hes been a part of that but in a 
constructive way and thats why hes my choice in this coming 
election 
but when pressed again whether he was answering yes to bushs 
alleged involvement in the twa hijacking reagan turned to answer 
another query about the circumstances of the release of the tape 
bush told nbc he was never involved in negotiations either in 
the twa or the irancontra cases according to press secretary 
sheila tate 
the vice president previously has said he was not a key player 
in the sale of arms to iran and was unaware of details and planning 
of it 
pressed to explain his and bushs involvement in the irancontra 
affair which the questioner described as having developed into a 
scandal the president shot back there was no scandal that 
scandal im afraid has been artificially created by a media that 
i cannot understand 
about prospects for release of anderson and other americans held 
in lebanon the president said im not going to give up hope for 
any of our hostages that are held thats just too unthinkable 
but he said the one thing we cannot do is negotiate with the 
kidnappers on a sort of ransom idea because that just encourages 
more kidnaping and more hostagetaking 
asked what about andersons statement that the united states 
appeared to show more interest in the release of the two gray 
whales trapped in the ice of alaska than the fate of the hostages 
reagan responded again that he believed anderson was only reading a 
script that had been given him 
when i was given a script i always read the lines he added 
andersons sister peggy say said monday her brother looked 
stronger than in the past adding he seemed somewhat relaxed i 
didnt see the kind of tension or fear that has come across in some 
of the pictures released in the past 
she said she has given up criticizing federal policy against 
negotiating with her brothers kidnappers 
you come to a place where you understand that when a horse 
dies you get off it say said the hostages are not a great 
enough number to excite the masses but if there were a plane 
load of americans would we allow our president to not lift a 
finger

american soprano catherine malfitano was cheered 
after a great performance in the title role of madama butterfly 
on monday night at the royal opera house covent garden 
the house had been sold out for weeks for the new production of 
giacomo puccinis opera by spanish actress and theater director 
nuria espert ms espert shared the acclaim when she joined the 
cast and production team in taking 11 curtain calls 
few women producers are in the opera business ms espert who 
has her own theater company in madrid has done only one other 
opera but she is quickly adding a reputation for the difficult art 
to her fame as an actress and stage director 
asked later in a dressingroom interview if she found any 
difference between direction by a woman and a man ms malfitano 
replied there isnt any but nuria is full of wonderful ideas 
and i was able to ask her questions about the role which i would 
have been hesitant to put to a man 
the new yorkborn singer added if there is a difference its 
a sense that she feels things i might feel about the character 
because she is a woman but thats not to say that men arent 
intuitive and sensitive 
ms malfitano gave a hearttugging interpretation of 
ciociosan the japanese geisha girl known as butterfly who falls 
in love with us navy officer benjamin franklin pinkerton 
in what looks like a very unjapanese reaction the singer 
writhes on the floor of her tenement apartment when she learns that 
pinkerton has deserted her and intends to take their son away 
nuria had me do that we both have great love for 
ciociosan ms malfitano explained 
we didnt do it from a japanese viewpoint this is an opera by 
a european and its a european view of japan but i think reaction 
to pain and grief is universal 
when we are alone we do things the world would not expect to 
see its a private moment thats very painful an extreme moment 
we express in an extreme way it should be shocking and almost 
surprising and it has the ring of truth the singer said 
ms malfitanos darkeyed beauty was enhanced by her long hair 
worn down to her waist in the role 
yes it is my own people are always asking me she said 
laughing 
her fathers parents emigrated to the united states from 
linguaglossa and fiumefreddo di sicilia in the foothills of the mt 
etna volcano 
welsh tenor arthur davies who sang pinkerton also said he 
found no difference in being directed by a woman 
chewing on a piece of butterscotch it moistens the mouth and 
i just happened to have it in my pocket he said nuria knows 
the piece and its just a matter of interpretation its what she 
wanted and i hope weve made sense of it 
the opera was first staged as a contemporary story in 1904 ms 
espert places it in 1937 to heighten the tension between americans 
and japanese four years before the attack at pearl harbor but she 
does not transform the story in any way she said before the first 
night she doesnt believe in directors opera 
it is just a fashion in opera the true director is the 
composer and everything is in the music you need a very good ear 
and to listen carefully ms espert told londons daily telegraph 
the cleverly designed tenement set on three floors was by 
italys ezio frigerio his wife franca squarciapino did the 
costumes 
denmarks michael schonwandt seemed to draw everything possible 
from his conducting of the opera house orchestra 
mezzosoprano miao qing who sang the role of ciociosans 
servant suzuki in her british debut is the first chinese artist 
to sing with the royal opera and she looked delighted waving her 
bouquet at the audience 
ms malfitano was given three bouquets and happily carried the 
largest of them away with her walking down floral street with her 
husband stephen and friends looking at the posters of the 
production

about 60000 government workers 
ended a fiveday strike on monday after receiving assurances that 
congress would consider their demands 
president jose azcona hoyo said the return to work may have 
prevented a coup 
we passed the test and now its a question of erasing the 
slate and starting over azcona hoyo told a news conference 
if there is no understanding and no dialogue such 
abnormalities as the strike end in a violent confrontation or a 
coup 
the workers members of the national association of public 
employees struck last wednesday and the armed forces occupied 
public buildings until the strike ended monday morning 
the strikers demanded paid vacations improved job security 
civil service reforms and varying pay increases their salary now 
averages 500 a month 
no settlement was reached azcona hoyo said he promised no 
retaliation would be made against strikers or strike leaders 
the president said he appointed a cabinet committee to determine 
how the nation of 5 million could pay union demands that the 
government estimated could cost 150 million a year congress will 
take up the issue in december 
association leader carlos obdulio chevez said that if the 
demands are not met we will go on strike again because the 
suspension of this strike does not mean we are giving up our 
demands 
chevez praised azcona hoyo saying the president was always 
ready to have a dialogue with us

a federal judge on monday blocked a state law 
that would have banned the three major television networks from 
conducting exit polls just outside voting places to predict winners 
on election night 
us district judge david doty saying the law is likely to be 
found unconstitutional issued a preliminary injunction against its 
enforcement 
the 1984 law prohibits voters from being asked how they voted 
within 100 feet of the polling place nearly half the states have 
some limits on exit polling in part because of fears that voter 
turnout will be hampered by early predictions of results 
the networks targeted minnesota along with six other states 
where they successfully challenged restrictions they considered so 
stringent they would effectively ban exit polls 
floyd abrams a new york lawyer representing cbs abc and nbc 
had argued that the minnesota law violates free speech and would 
prevent family members from asking each other how they voted if 
they were within the zoned area 
were delighted abrams said of dotys ruling its a 
first amendment right that the public have that information 
if the voter doesnt want to answer questions he doesnt have 
to but if th voter is willing to answer the questions he should 
be able to be a part of the process 
doty said that one of the principal concerns of the first 
amendment is the free discussion of governmental affairs he also 
said the first amendment protects the news medias right to gather 
information 
thus exit polling which involves gathering and disseminating 
information on governmental affairs is protected by the free 
speech clause of the first amendment doty wrote 
peter ackerberg a special assistant state attorney general had 
argued that the minnesota law was passed to preserve the sanctity 
of the polling place to prevent harassment of voters to prevent 
congestion and confusion around the polling place and to encourage 
voter participation 
ackerberg said he would not comment on dotys ruling until he 
sees it tuesday 
doty said legislators who wrote the law were primarily concerned 
with alleviating the threat that people might be discouraged from 
voting if a projection indicates that a particular outcome of an 
election is almost a certainty 
such a purpose is not a sufficient basis for restricting 
otherwise constitutionally protected speech doty wrote 
abrams said the networks have successfully fought similar exit 
polling restrictions in florida georgia kentucky montana 
washington and wyoming 
exit polling became controversial in 1980 when it became clear 
after polls closed in the east that ronald reagan would defeat 
president jimmy carter by a landslide many westerners were still 
voting when the networks declared reagan the winner 
the three networks say this year they will project winners of 
the presidential race statebystate as polls close but will 
refrain from declaring a winner overall until after voters on the 
west coast cast their ballots 
state rep randy kelly chairman of the house judiciary 
committee and a proponent of the law said the legislature is not 
likely to repeal the exit poll law unless courts declare it 
unconstitutional 
kelly said exit polls might greatly reduce the voting of 
people in a democracy 
abrams said the networks may try to obtain a permanent 
injunction against the minnesota law after the election but he 
said the next legal step by the networks will hinge on whether 
minnesota officials persist in opposing our efforts to conduct 
exit polls

the busy presidential campaign helped 
persuade the government monday to settle a false arrest lawsuit 
accusing secret service agents of beating a bystander during a 1984 
raid on counterfeiters attorneys said 
the government which needs the services during the campaign 
season of agents who might have had to testify agreed to pay 
edward scala of jersey city 2500 but admitted no wrongdoing for 
the sept 8 1984 incident scala had sued for 1 million in 
damages 
theyre busy assistant us attorney jeffrey d smith said 
of the agents who would have had to testify and prepare for a 
trial this is big crunch time he said referring to the 
comings and goings of the candidates 
the secret service a branch of the us treasury department 
has the duty of protecting political figures and investigating 
counterfeiting 
scala charged that when agents burst into his jersey city 
building to raid a counterfeiting ring they handcuffed him beat 
him and dragged him through the hallway and caused him severe and 
permanent injuries said his lawsuit which was filed 18 months 
later 
the agents struck scala in the head neck and groin according 
to the complaint 
they also entered his apartment without a proper search warrant 
it said 
the treasury department in november 1985 denied an 
administrative settlement so he went to federal court for damages 
and legal costs 
smith said scala was never struck and was only detained after 
running away from the agents he was handcuffed for 30 seconds and 
held for under five minutes until agents were told that scala was a 
resident of the building the attorney said 
an agent chased scala into his apartment on the basis of a broad 
search warrant smith added 
during the raid scala was kind of rubbernecking you might 
say smith said 
smith said the afternoon raid netted 75 million in counterfeit 
currency the largest such seizure at the time in new jersey the 
bogus bills were mostly in denominations of 10 and 20 five 
people were arrested and convicted or pleaded guilty he said 
scala in his 50s could not be reached for comment his home 
telphone number is not published his attorney john schwartz 
declined to comment on the settlement he said his client was 
unemployed 
the suit did not specify the nature of scalas injuries

the reagan administration is expected to 
respond to an appeal from south korea early this week by announcing 
an easing of diplomatic and trade restrictions against north korea 
according to us officials 
the moves are a complement to efforts by south korean president 
roh tae woo who has called for a northsouth summit meeting and a 
resumption of trade between the two koreas as part of an attempt to 
ease tensions on the peninsula 
roh met with president reagan 10 days ago and suggested the 
united states take some modest steps in coordination with south 
koreas own moves although modest the gestures planned by the 
administration are believed to be the most extensive the united 
states has adopted toward the communist north since the korean 
armistice was signed 35 years ago

oscar campaigns begin earlier every year and 
already the guns of autumn are firing for such potential nominees 
as tom hanks jodie foster sigourney weaver and don ameche 
the studios and publicity offices are readying trade paper ads 
to offer films and performances for your consideration the ads 
will feature reviewers comments that a certain actors work is 
deserving of academy award recognition the champ in that 
department is tom hanks 
the affable hanks has been the subject of the biggest publicity 
blitz since last years blast for cher who ended up with the 
bestactress oscar for moonstruck 
first with big and then with punchline hanks has been 
the recipient of glowing reviews many of which mentioned his oscar 
chances 
a hanks nomination seems certain but for which movie if 
academy voters judge by financial success they might choose his 
role in big as the youngster who is transformed overnight into 
a 30yearold but they might consider his troubled comic in 
punchline more of a challenge 
some observers believe weaver is overdue for an oscar and she 
is likely to be nominated for her role as the obsessed naturalist 
dian fossey in gorillas in the mist if the academy had an 
award for bravery she would certainly win it for working 
intimately with the wild gorillas 
two recent performances have drawn academy predictions from many 
reviewers jodie fosters rape victim in the accused don 
ameches innocent among the mafia in things change 
unlike 1987 when most of the academy hopefuls were clumped in 
the final weeks this time an impressive array of films and 
performances has been spread out over the year although more 
potential nominees will appear in november and december its 
possible to offer a survey of possibilities thus far 
as with last year the strongest race appears to be among the 
female stars aside from weaver and foster other performances 
which have attracted strong support include shirley maclaine 
madame sousatzka barbara hershey a world apart meryl 
streep a cry in the dark whoopi goldberg claras heart

bull durham 
however so far no runaway has been sighted for best picture of 
1988 here are some possibles big gorillas in the mist 
punchline a cry in the dark bull durham madame 
sousatzka 
the oscar race will undoubtedly change as new entries reach the 
marketplace the most promising works include 
rainman with dustin hoffman tom cruise 
torch song trilogy starring harvey fierstein in the film 
version of his hit play with anne bancroft and matthew broderick

parishioners found moistened sponges in the 
holy water fonts recently at the modenas 12th century roman 
catholic cathedral archbishop santo quadri apologized explaining 
that the fonts had to be drained to stop drug addicts from using 
them to rinse their needles 
drug addiction said the archbishop is one of the heaviest 
crosses italy is carrying today 
in the first nine months of this year 500 deaths in the country 
have been attributed to heroin overdoses more than all of 1987 
former premier bettino craxi said mafiacontrolled drug 
smuggling and killings will soon reach south american 
proportions in italy and called for life sentences for pushers 
police seizures of heroin have risen from 11440 ounces in 1987 
to more than 14080 ounces so far this year the use of cocaine 
once reserved for the wealthy is booming with police seizing more 
than 17600 ounces this year compared to 14472 ounces in all of 
last year 
drug pushers and users have been growing younger every year a 
common urban sight has been police and sniffer dogs inspecting 
students bags at the gates of high schools on the first day of 
school in september 113 drug peddlers were picked up across the 
country while lurking outside school buildings 
the drug explosion has also stoked the spread of aids which can 
be transmitted through dirty needles turning italy into the second 
worst affected country in europe behind france 
according to the world health organization most of italys 
2233 aids victims have been heroin addicts 
the spread of drugs has been most spectacular in the rich north 
home of hightech companies sleek factories and many of italys 
estimated 300000 heroin addicts 
the communist municipal government in modena where ferrari 
racing cars are made has started subsidizing rehabilitation 
clinics and methadone substitution programs opera star luciano 
pavarotti a city native has performed free for antidrug benefits 
in the neighboring lombardy region which accounts for nearly 
one quarter of the heroin deaths the city of milan has put drugs 
just behind motor vehicle traffic as a top municipal priority city 
workers have been detached to scoop up 3000 to 4000 discarded 
syringes daily from streets and parks in rome a similar municipal 
service has collected close to half a million in the past year 
because of the sicilian mafia and the camorra crime organization 
in naples italy is considered one of the main international 
shipping points for heroin to the united states and europe 
for years the gangs largely refrained from selling on their 
home turf out of a sense of honor but more and more drugs are 
being distributed at home because of a glut in other markets 
according to the italian interior ministry 
italys current drug law was passed in the wake of the more 
lenient atmosphere of the 1970s it penalizes peddling while 
allowing possession of modest quantities 
sociologist saverio vertone charges that the law has turned 
every buyer into a potential pusher 
parliament followed the prevailing winds at the time said 
vertone even lsd was considered ok for personal consumption 
vertone has joined the chorus of italians who are demanding 
tougher measures in the drug war pushers now face a maximum term 
of 30 years 
the rev mario picchi a catholic priest who runs a string of 
rehabilitation centers believes users should not be placed in the 
same category as pushers 
drug addicts need assistance he said you cant punish an 
alcoholic just because hes had a drink the dealers of death on 
the other hand must face tougher sentences 
one of picchis proposals would provide for fines for 
recreational drug users

creators came up with the idea of going to the soviet union for a 
rematch in the show howard hesseman plays the teacher of a class 
of young geniuses at manhattans millard fillmore high school 
one part of the story calls for arvid and dennis dan schneider 
to get lost just before the competition 
were trying to get back and we split up on the metro subway 
the metro stops are really beautiful some have chandeliers some 
have cathedral ceilings said frischman 
it was a chance to experience another culture completely 
different from our own we had a chance to work with the soviets 
and experience the same kind of problems they experience i got to 
talk to a lot of young people who are much more optimistic about 
their future than their elders i did some standup comedy at 
moscow university and saw that humor is a universal language it 
was good to know my act works in moscow 
givens and tyson have since filed for divorce but the moscow 
trip was apparently a contented time 
i had trouble believing all the headlines about marital 
problems frischman said what i saw was a happy couple mike 
was very polite no one was jealous of all the publicity they got 
but if the marriage had worked out i was considering getting 
married myself i was thinking of mount fiji the worlds women 
wrestling champion 
frischman was in his dressing room outside stage 5 at the 
burbank studios where head of the class is taped before an 
audience the show scheduled to tape that night featured his 
character in a story in which arvids father comes to the school 
an audience is necessary for me being a comedian at heart 
said frischman having a crowd to play to is half the fun but i 
find the audience reacts better to arvid if i dont go out as 
myself they like to see arvid 
my standup is much different i talk about dan frischman and 
my life experiences my romantic trials and heroic deeds 
frischman is also writing an abc afterschool special that he 
hopes to star in

sweden has toughened its requirements 
for granting asylum to soviet defectors acting on the kremlins 
word that the human rights climate is improving 
so far as is known the swedes are the first in western europe 
to modify their refugee policy to adjust for glasnost soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachevs policy of openness 
the swedish immigration board has issued deportation orders 
against 10 soviets asking to stay the board held that they did not 
qualify as political refugees and that the risk has diminished they 
will be punished if they return home 
until last spring asylum requests were routinely granted on 
the assumption that anyone who was sent back could be prosecuted 
for antisoviet behavior 
but now the legal environment has changed in the soviet 
union said bjorn westin an immigration board official and sweden 
now will judge each case on its merits 
all 10 of the soviets ordered deported have appealed and are 
still in sweden while the 10 were turned down the immigration 
board approved about 80 other applications officials said 
westin said those who were refused are not refugees we dont 
turn away refugees 
he added that the board after checking each case with the 
swedish embassy in moscow was convinced that none would face 
reprisals 
if that had been the case we wouldnt turn them back 
sweden which has one of the most liberal refugee policies in 
europe gets more requests for asylum from soviets than any other 
country on the continent 
defectors often leave the soviet union with legal visas then 
refuse to go back when their visas expire others reach the west 
after dramatic escapes last year a farm hand flew a crop duster 
airplane across the baltic sea and crashed near swedens gotland 
island 
among 18000 or so people granted asylum in sweden last year 73 
came from the soviet union while other countries in western europe 
accepted fewer than 10 soviets each 
the number of soviets asking to stay in sweden was expected to 
reach 120 by the end of this year partly because soviet 
authorities were allowing more people to travel abroad and were 
less careful to make sure they intended to come back officials 
said 
officials questioned in spain greece italy denmark and 
switzerland said the rules for soviet citizens are no different 
from for any other country and have not changed in view of glasnost 
of course overall developments in the soviet union play a 
role but we wouldnt go so far as to say that due to glasnost and 
perestroika restructuring the problem has been solved said 
heinz schoeni spokesman for switzerlands refugee commissioner in 
geneva 
finland which is the only noncommunist country to share a long 
land border with the soviet union and has a friendship pact 
with the kremlin has handled the question of soviet defectors 
delicately and usually in secret many reportedly have been turned 
away or quietly told to take the next ferry to sweden 
swedens decision to scrutinize soviet asylum seekers more 
carefully has caused consternation among soviet emigres who say 
they have less faith than the swedish government in soviet pledges 
of human rights reforms 
ulo ignatz editor of an estonianlanguage newspaper published 
in stockholm said that those who return to the soviet union may 
not be imprisoned as before but may find their careers blocked or 
face other forms of harassment 
the legislation has not been changed juris kaza a 
stockholmbased freelance journalist specializing in the baltic 
states said of the soviet pledges on human rights 
the statute against antisoviet activity is still on the 
books its an arbitrary decision not to prosecute he said 
swedens move also caught human rights groups by surprise 
its quite a new problem for us said jan bolling of the 
swedish branch of the londonbased amnesty international 
we cant say that from our point of view asylum seekers face 
less of a risk today we have no such information

a clandestine group calling itself the 
sons of glendower has stepped up a 9yearold arson campaign 
against englishowned property in wales increasing fears that the 
attacks will begin to claim lives 
the group chooses violence to fight what many welsh oppose the 
increased immigration of the english into wales 
celtic wales has been united with saxon england for 452 years 
but nationalism remains a strong undercurrent in wales and the 
english influx is widely blamed for diluting the welsh language and 
culture and inflating house prices beyond reach of the local people 
such themes are not confined to wales regional nationalism is a 
flourishing often divisive force in this united kingdom of 
england scotland wales and northern ireland not to mention 
subdivisions like cornwall and the isle of man where outsiders 
vacation homes are also a target of local nationalists 
but in this western coastal region of britain the welsh 
extremists have struck more frequently in recent months and have 
pushed across the border to burn down property in england 
the arsonists who have their supporters but are shunned by the 
nationalist mainstream also have expanded their targets from 
mostly vacation homes to commercial property like real estate 
offices and they have begun using more sophisticated incendiary 
timebombs 
nobody expects the attacks to escalate into a conflict like 
northern irelands which has killed about 2700 people in the past 
20 years but the timebombs which could go off at the wrong time 
or in the wrong hands are causing serious concern 
we have been so concerned about this change in tactics said 
inspector john hughesjones at the colwyn bay headquarters of the 
north wales police it is a miracle that nobody has been 
seriously injured or killed with the recent escalation the odds 
of that happening are shortening all the time 
recent weeks have seen at least 11 attacks on real estate 
offices shops and a vacation home eight of those came on one 
weekend in early october over a widespread area of western england 
fears also are growing that the campaign might encourage old 
prejudices and discourage jobcreating inward investment problems 
northern ireland knows well 
obviously anything of that sort would not exactly advertise 
the place said roger mansfield director of the university of 
wales cardiff business school it has the potential of 
developing into a major problem 
since 1979 19 men have been convicted of arson and damage 
offenses police say but the force has made no arrests in three 
years and it is being criticized for failing to unmask the sons of 
glendower 
plaid cymru the welsh nationalist party which has three seats 
in the 650member house of commons strongly opposes the violent 
campaign its president dafydd elis thomas has called the police 
most ineffective and urged the government to apply pressure for 
better results 
the police say they lack evidence partly because the public is 
uncooperative 
its quite a big percentage who a obviously know something 
but dont want to tell us or b those who know something that 
they dont know would help us hughesjones said 
wales brought under english rule by king edward i in 1282 and 
united with england in 1536 has a long history of protest against 
its conquerors in the 1960s for example a group called the free 
welsh army waged a violent antienglish campaign 
the welsh language society for years has waged nonviolent 
protest against english immigration staging sitins in real estate 
offices and glueing their locks 
nonviolent nationalists support measures such as limiting 
property sales to english newcomers and imposing higher taxes on 
second homes 
the sons of glendower or meibion glyndwyr take their name from 
owen glendower a 15thcentury welsh rebel leader 
the group is believed to be responsible for most of the 150 
arson incidents counted primarily in rural picturesque north 
wales since the first attack on a cottage in mynydd nefyn dec 13 
1979 police said 
the group which initially broke into empty homes and built 
simple fires has made erratic phone calls and delivered letters 
claiming responsibity over the years 
the target now sic the colonists and the capitalists said 
a letter delivered to htv the welsh television station after 
recent attacks on a tackle shop and canoe gear store in wales 
they are the enemies of the people their free markets are 
killing wales we demand justice 
it was signed rhys gethin who was a lieutenant of owen 
glendower police said 
the extremists most prominent public supporter is the welsh 
poet rs thomas a retired minister who earlier this year 
described them as the only true defenders of welsh language and 
culture 
owain williams a founding member of a new nationalist movement 
called y cyfamodwyr or the covenanters doesnt go that far but 
says he wont condemn thomas stance because the situation is 
desperate it needs desperate measures 
williams added they are expected to lie down and take it as a 
streamroller crushes them west into the sea we are becoming the 
dispossessed in our own land this is our last foothold 
the british governments welsh office says it has no statistics 
showing how many of wales 28 million people are english but 
nationalists say their numbers are multiplying significantly 
the english are believed to comprise less than 20 percent of 
wales population but reliable statistics on their numbers and the 
migration trend are hard to come by because the british are not 
required to register their english or other nationality 
but welsh nationalists say the english immigrants numbers are 
multiplying significantly 
middleclass english people are taking advantage of a property 
boom in southeast england to sell high at home and buy cheaper 
homes in wales which many believe to be an idyllic spot for 
raising a family as well as for retirement weekends and vacations 
a recent revival of the welsh economy has made it easier for the 
english to find jobs in wales and many of those who dont find 
local employment choose to commute some go as far as london which 
is about 200 miles to the southeast or a train ride of about four 
hours from this coastal resort 
meanwhile the percentage of people speaking welsh which is 
taught in schools and is highly visible on the nations bilingual 
signs has declined to 64 percent in the welshspeaking areas this 
year from 713 percent in 1981 a recent survey for htv indicated 
the survey also showed that 57 percent of the 1000 people 
questioned in west and north wales supported the aims of the sons 
of glendower although only 6 percent endorsed the arson campaign

in an adventure with almost as many twists and 
plot turns as the movie itself ayn rands we the living is 
about to make it to american theaters the 46yearold film was 
thought to have been destroyed by mussolini 
we the living was made in wartime italy in 1942 and was 
based on the novel of the same name by ayn rand whose 
objectivism philosphy in such works as the fountainhead and 
atlas shrugged made her a cult figure in the 1970s 
the movie has caused a stir over the years and has repeatedly 
won critical acclaim from the venice festival of 1942 to the 
fourth annual boston film festival last month 
a surface indictment of communism the lushly photographed 
romantic saga is set in russia as the tidal wave of revolution 
boiled down to a new party system that meant enormous changes in 
the way people lived and loved and survived 
rossano brazzi costars as a tubercular aristocat who cant get 
a job or a slot in a sanitarium because aristocrats are out of 
fashion he said he made arrangements for rand to get her first 
look at the film when he met her in hollywood after the war 
however he didnt think italys fascist government had ordered the 
movie to be destroyed 
it went out of circulation because the natural life of the 
film was over brazzi said in a telephone interview from his home 
in rome 
but massimo ferrarasantamaria a rome lawyer who was general 
manager of the studio where the movie was made said he was called 
before a fascist tribunal and ordered to destroy negatives and 
copies of the film and was stripped of his position at the studio 
and as lecturer at italian universities for his role in making the 
movie 
in the tragic italian war situation the film was called by 
the public noi morti we the dead he said in an interview 
adding that nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels banned the 
film in germany after ferrara personally showed it at goebbels 
berlin home in october 1942 
at the end of the screening goebbels told me that the 
russians were habitually presented to the german public in a much 
more negative way than in this picture and therefore it was no 
good for germany he said 
erika and henry mark holzer the movies producers were rands 
lawyers in the 1960s mrs holzer said the author believed the 
banning story and authorized a search for the film that took the 
two attorneys through hundreds of interviews and dusty archives it 
finally culminated two years later when they met a dealer with a 
bunch of italian films for sale 
they rode through the bumpy back streets of rome with a load of 
potentially explosive nitratetreated film in the back of an old 
truck including the negative for we the living they had the 
movie transferred to safety film before flying it back to new 
york 
mrs holzer believes they found the original nitrate negative 
which ferrara had hidden 
ferrara and others say italys ministry of culture ordered the 
film destroyed about five months after its release on the grounds 
that though the message might purport to be anticommunist it 
could also be taken as antitotalitarian a strong statement for 
individualism regardless of political coloration 
the fascists didnt want that kind of propaganda message playing 
on the homefront with italys axis troops stretched from north 
africa to stalingrad and the allies storming the beaches of sicily 
rand had a hardline libertarian philosophy it was best 
exemplified by gary cooper in the fountainhead who played an 
architect who blows up his own creation rather than allow it to be 
desecrated by the whims of popularism 
mrs holzer said rand liked the film version of we the 
living even more than the fountainhead although the author 
had written the latters screenplay herself and was not asked for 
permission for the italian film 
brazzi said it was a socalled war movie well worry after 
the war about paying for it he said rand eventually did receive 
compensation from scalera the producing studio 
mrs holzer said that once she and her husband recovered an 
original nitrate negative rand went through the film frame by 
frame to identify exactly how she wanted it edited the italian 
version was made in two parts and ran over 4 hours the project 
was set aside when rand had other commitments and was not picked 
up until after the authors death in 1982 the film was restored by 
duncan scott 
the epic was shot entirely on indoor elaborately built italian 
wartime sets recreating russian country scenes trains ships and 
petrograd 
im told almost the entire white russian community in italy 
was used as extras mrs holzer said 
the new version distributed by angelika films is under three 
hours and is set for release nov 5 in boston nov 11 in los 
angeles and nov 25 in new york it will play to other major us 
markets before january 
the film also stars a young and radiant alida valli the female 
lead in the 1949 british thriller the third man and fosco 
giachetti who was the no 1 boxoffice draw in italy when the 
movie was made according to its producers 
we the living has a bit of soap opera in it beautiful kira 
loves leo the tubercular aristocat andrei of the dreaded secret 
police loves kira because she has the courage to be independent and 
defiant of the new order 
but underneath the suds is a hard reality kira forsakes her 
love when he turns out not tough enough to toe a moral line andrei 
kills himself when he realizes first that kira used him to get leo 
a spot in a sanitarium and that his adored party leaves no freedom 
for individuals to decide whether they wish to be scoundrel or 
saint 
kira goes forward wiser but unbowed a testimony to the strong 
and the living and the survival of the toughest 
rand who espoused a personal philosophy based on unfettered 
capitalism and rational selfishness held individual freedom as 
the highest ideal she said alturism was weakness and blamed it 
for much of the worlds woes but she also attacked libertarians of 
the right who often identified with her philosophy

editors note they go through bizarre rituals that caricature 
everyday behavior they become puppets of a relentless compulsion 
and lose the capacity to trust their senses the disorder not as 
rare as one would think has long been intractable but now 
breakthroughs in drug and behavior therapy bring new hope to those 
so strangely afflicted the first of two stories

every morning for 20 years april rose before dawn while her 
family slept april scrubbed sinks toilets floors doorknobs an 
evergrowing list sometimes she ran through it twice 
on bad days shed be halfway to work before realizing shed 
forgotten something at home once i went out i was 
contaminated she says going back in meant i had to shower 
change clothes and clean house all over again 
on joes worst days he spent hours darting about his apartment 
in panic was the door locked stove off window closed some days 
hed check for hours and still not be sure 
mike had to count the steps he took the coins in his pocket 
the times he chewed every bite though not superstitious i was 
counting to make sure i didnt do anything 13 times he says 
if i did i felt my father would die of a heart attack 
april joe and mike suffer from obsessivecompulsive disorder 
for centuries one of the most baffling and intractable mental 
illnesses throughout history ocd sufferers from samuel johnson to 
howard hughes have been slaves to the intrusive irrational 
thoughts known as obsessions and the senseless repetitive 
rituals or compulsions that accompany them 
now breakthroughs in drug treatment and behavior therapy are 
bringing new hope to ocd victims the discoveries coincide with 
mounting evidence of a link between ocd and other neurological 
illnesses and movement disorders such as some forms of epilepsy 
parkinsons disease and tourettes syndrome 
along with generating wide medical interest the developments 
are helping ease the stigma long felt by ocd victims who are 
seeking help in unprecedented numbers as a result researchers 
have concluded that the illness once considered rare is actually 
fairly common 
whether you know it or not says one expert you do know 
someone with this disease 
chances are you dont know it ocd usually strikes healthy 
sane people who are adept at hiding their symptoms from spouses 
employers and friends that theyre able to do it is remarkable 
given the debilitating nature of the illness 
a respected accountant cannot mail a letter without tearing it 
open to make sure his daughter isnt sealed inside 
a skilled engineer cant drive to work without retracing his 
route over and over for fear he ran over a pedestrian on the way 
a young housewife turns her basement into a repository for 
everything from used kitty litter to carpet lint for reasons shes 
at a loss to explain 
some conceal their behavior by distancing themselves emotionally 
and physically compared to the general public people with ocd are 
nearly twice as likely not to marry and more likely to divorce if 
they do 
revised estimates now hold that the socalled doubting 
disease affects roughly 2 percent of the population between 4 
million and 6 million people in the united states alone 
the majority of them are as aware and as ashamed of their 
aberrant behavior as they are powerless to stop it 
telling a person to stop washing or stop checking is like 
telling the average person to stop breathing says jenny a wife 
and mother who says ocd stole 15 years of her life like others who 
agreed to discuss their illness she asked that her last name not 
be used 
jennys illness began with a cancer obsession that sent her 
scurrying from doctor to doctor i began having hysterical 
reactions like worrying so much about getting a bump on my tongue 
that i would actually get a bump on my tongue 
abruptly those fears vanished replaced by something worse 
relentless incapacitating fears of losing control and stabbing her 
children i had my suicide all planned jenny says i was 
going to lock myself in the garage and turn on my car 
instead jenny sought treatment at a yale university clinic 
like an estimated twothirds of the ocd patients who undergo the 
new behavior therapy or drug treatment she got better 
dr wayne k goodman is chief of the obsessivecompulsive 
disorder clinic at yale in three years of treating ocd i have 
seen it go away although most people are not totally free of 
symptoms after therapy the obsessions are still there the 
difference is they no longer have to perform the compulsions 
today jenny estimates her illness is with her 2 percent of the 
time she keeps it at bay with a small maintenance dose of an 
antidepressant when they do surface she says the thoughts are 
manageable and easily discarded 
jenny now works fulltime attends graduate school and helps 
run the north haven connbased ocd foundation an education 
information and referral service she founded with a small group of 
patients 
jennys obsessions fear of disease and fear of harming others 
are among the most common as are fear of death dirt or germs 
of harming oneself of uttering obscenities or insults of 
discarding something of great value 
others include perverse sexual or violent images blasphemous 
thoughts exaggerated fears of chemical or environmental 
contamination 
compulsions often include ritualistic washing or cleaning 
counting to certain numbers or avoiding others continually 
checking doors windows stoves hoarding or collecting newspapers 
mail lint string arranging and rearranging drawers closets 
cupboards 
most people with ocd pass through a washing phase at some point 
during their illness while specific obsessions may change over 
time the themes tend to stay the same goodman says 
for many patients fear of cancer has been replaced by fear of 
aids a disease made to order for ocd victims one expert says 
dr judith rapoport of the national institute of mental health 
believes that compulsive behavior handwashing checking or 
counting actually comes first followed by the obsession or 
rationale for the behavior 
man is a rational being when he finds himself doing something 
that looks purposeful for example repeated washing his logical 
mind has to find a reason she says

obsessions and compulsions can turn up in families previously 
untouched by mental illness but are more likely to cluster in 
families with histories of ocd or its frequent companion 
depression 
although it affects men and women in equal numbers children 
with ocd are twice as apt to be boys it often strikes young 
adults but many can recall bouts of obsessive behavior from 
childhood and doctors have spotted it in children as young as 3 
obsessive thoughts or compulsive behaviors lurk beneath the 
surface in nearly everyone most people regard neatness and 
exactitude as desirable traits and who hasnt raced home to 
doublecheck an appliance worried excessively about cancer or 
gotten a tune stuck in his head 
no one can pinpoint where meticulousness or rigidity leave off 
and illness begins still the experts agree that the periodic 
preoccupations of everyday life bear little resemblance to the 
relentless involuntary allconsuming nature of ocd 
at their worst according to rapoport the habits of ocd 
patients become gross caricatures and distortions of useful 
everyday behavior 
my patients fight exhausting battles with invisible germs 
daily even hourly rapoport writes in the boy who couldnt 
stop washing the first popular book on ocd to be published 
by ep dutton in january rapoport whos been treating the 
illness since 1972 is hoping the book will lure more victims out 
of hiding 
at the core of the doubting disease is the inability to be 
reassured by the senses rapoport writes somehow the message 
that the house is clean or the doors are locked doesnt get 
through in one way or another she says every patient with 
ocd wants to know how to know 
unlike gambling overeating or other activities commonly labeled 
compulsive ocds senseless rituals bring no pleasure i 
hated to count says mike a young shoe salesman all i ever 
wanted was to stop 
like others with the illness he had no choice but to keep 
counting steps stairs shoes everything 
peggy a secretary in her 30s with flowing brown hair and a 
bubbly outgoing manner couldnt stop cleaning a compulsion that 
literally popped up overnight 
one weekend when i was 21 i went away with my family she 
recalls we walked into a motel room and everything felt dirty 
when i brought my clothes home the next day they felt dirty too 
that was the beginning 
soon other things bothered peggy the drugstore the 
hospital the garbage truck anything that had to do with germs or 
disease 
on a good day peggy bathed with bar soap and water on bad 
days she scrubbed her skin raw with lysol i stashed lysol all 
over the house like an alcoholic hides booze i carried it in my 
purse 
over time peggys life became more and more disrupted though 
lonely she stayed away from her parents and turned down dates to 
protect others from her contamination 
she did much of her work twice once at the office and again at 
home where she put on rubber gloves and copied everything over on 
clean paper she bypassed the corner grocery and drove to 
distant supermarkets so as not to contaminate any stores she might 
one day need to go back to 
if id buy a new outfit suddenly it would be contaminated 
you either washed it to death or threw it out i looked like hell 
i couldnt use makeup because id contaminate it and how many 
times can you afford to throw away your makeup and buy all new 
stuff 
april whose symptoms were similar became her own plumber and 
repairman her house was offlimits to all but her husband and 
sons as soon as they got home at night they were required to use 
the shower april had installed in the basement showering in the 
upstairs bathroom was forbidden 
though she had two children and a fulltime teaching job april 
couldnt accept help with the housework i would have no way of 
knowing what my husband had touched before he picked out our 
groceries or whatever 
her sons werent allowed to go to movies or play in the yard but 
were confined to a concrete patio april hosed down each morning at 
school she couldnt use the bathroom no matter how long her day 
and she retreated to her classroom whenever hallways were crowded 
if a student inadvertently bumped her it would bother her for a 
week 
what was life like it was hell says april a neatly 
dressed middleaged woman with short graying hair a tense mouth 
and reddened eyes that burn with sorrow if you have a cancer or 
a heart condition you can be consoled with this youd be 
ostracized you have to hide it people would think my judgment is 
impaired even though im a good teacher 
her eyes fill and her voice quavers as she recalls her medical 
history ive been hospitalized put on medications given shock 
treatments the psychiatrists said to restrain me to take away all 
my buckets 
unlike april who for 20 years never stopped seeking help peggy 
would still be hiding if a friend hadnt found out and urged her to 
get treatment otherwise she might never have known her terrible 
secret had a name 
many doctors dont know either often mistaking ocd for 
depression or schizophrenia physicians want to diagnose things 
they can treat says rapoport who adds that until recently her 
profession had little to offer ocd patients 
for the time being most doctors view ocd as a chronic illness 
that can be controlled but not cured but given steppedup research 
by scientists and drug companies around the world the prognosis is 
increasingly hopeful 
meanwhile april waits after seven years of drug and behavior 
treatments she feels more in control of the illness that has 
tormented her for 21 years but she knows she has yet to break free 
my son wants to come home from college for thanksgiving and 
shower upstairs she says sadly i dont think im ready for 
that

editors note its called obsessivecompulsive disorder and is 
as unpleasant as it sounds forcing victims to irrational 
repetitions of such mundane tasks as cleaning and washing it has 
been a hard disease for therapists to outwit but they are 
succeeding now through ingenious methods one is flooding 
patients with the fears that drive their compulsions 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
gathering dog hair directing home movies and 
simulating storms arent part of a typical therapists repertoire 
but for samuel turner and deborah beidel such things are often all 
in a days work 
turner and beidel of the university of pittsburghs western 
ptute and clinic are among a growing number of 
specialists who are using behavior therapy to tresychiatric instiat victims 
of 
obsessivecompulsive disorder a mysterious illness of senseless 
repetitive rituals driven by runaway doubts 
people with ocd often engage in excessive cleaning counting or 
checking to ease intense fears of contamination disease or other 
catastrophe much of their energy typically goes into hiding their 
illness from others 
until recently ocd which affects about 2 percent of the 
population was considered among the most treatmentresistant 
tments and new therapeutic techniques pioneered in europe 
at the anxiety disorders clinic run by the universitys medical 
school turner and beidel treat ocd patients by flooding them 
with exposure to the very objects images or events they fear most 
the patients are then prevented from carrying out their compulsions 
the theory behind flooding is that the stimuli that has the 
ability to produce anxiety loses that ability through repeated 
exposure says turner an associate professor of psychiatry 
for a woman obsessed with contamination caused by animals 
treatment meant enduring a lapful of dog hair followed by exposure 
to a dog after touching the hair and petting the dog the patient 
was not allowed to carry out her washing compulsions 
later a therapist visited the patient at home where she had 
routinely spent up to 18 hours a day cleaning together patient 
and therapist made their way through the house touching doors 
walls clothes towels and sheets 
although the sessions made her anxious and upset the woman 
agreed not to clean or wash afterward the anxiety gradually 
diminished and the need to perform the rituals faded finally the 
woman completed her treatment by bringing a friends cat into her 
home and playing with it 
just as obsessions and compulsions vary from one patient to 
another so do the treatments turner and beidel concoct one former 
patient was obsessed with thunderstorms to the extent that 
darkness or even clouds made him frantic because of the 
unpredictable nature of real thunderstorms his therapists 
recreated one using taped sound effects and narration 
for a woman who served meals in the basement for fear of 
contaminating the kitchen turner and beidel made a videotape of 
family members eating in the kitchen smashing crackers with 
their feet really messing things up 
turner whos been treating ocd patients since 1980 says 
behavior therapy might reduce a patients primary symptoms in as 
little as three to five months but often considerable followup 
may be needed 
they have to learn their limits for handling stress we try to 
help them recognize what constitutes stresses for them since the 
illness often follows periods of emotional distress turner says 
people who have spent years in selfimposed exile may need help 
with interpersonal skills others may need marital therapy to 
repair years of damage done by their illness in addition says 
turner compulsions can take up huge chunks of time patients who 
get better often need help figuring out how to fill their days more 
productively 
the prognosis may depend on the extent to which the patient 
believes his obsession is real other factors include what else 
is wrong in their lives and how socially adjusted they are 
turner says 
turner describes the therapy as unorthodox and timeconsuming 
but the response can be very dramatic he says as a rule 
they do get better 
like others turner often combines the therapy with drug 
treatment many patients have shown dramatic improvement in 
controlled studies of drugs such as anafranil and more recently 
fluoxetine and fluvoxamine all are powerful antidepressants that 
affect serotonin a chemical transmitter within the brain 
laboratory rats with altered serotonin display ritualistic 
checking behavior that resembles compulsions 
fluvoxamine and anafranil or clomipramine as its known 
generically are available in the united states on an 
investigational basis only fluoxetine trade name prozac is 
available for use in depression experts point out that its worth 
trying all three since not all of them work for all patients 
that the illness responds both to drugs and to therapy is a 
puzzle to researchers but the pieces are beginning to fall into 
place 
harsh discipline premature toilet training and unresolved 
oedipal conflicts have long been considered prime suspects in ocd 
today all findings point to a new culprit biology freud 
himself had suspected as much 
until 30 or 40 years ago though the worst cases were treated 
with lobotomies andor hospitalization replaced over the next 20 
years by psychotherapy or psychoanalysis neither of which did much 
good 
the old theories began to give way during the 70s when 
sophisticated diagnostic tools brought a heightened emphasis on the 
link between physiology and mental illness 
the result has been a wealth of new evidence culled from 
laboratory research drug testing and interviews with ocd victims 
among the most compelling arguments is the connection between 
ocd and tourettes syndrome a disease marked by involuntary tics 
multiple motor movements and the uncontrollable blurting of sounds 
phrases and in some cases obscenities obsessions and compulsions 
occur in onethird of all cases of tourettes a disease of the 
basal ganglia the main relay station between sensory information 
learned behavior and motor movement 
positron emission testing pet scans diagnostic tools that 
enable researchers to study the working brain have revealed 
abnormalities in areas of ocd patients brains that correspond to 
areas affected by tourettes 
if anyones been skeptical the relationship between ocd and 
tourettes really settled it says wayne k goodman chief of the 
obsessivecompulsive disorder clinic at yale university 
one emerging theory holds that ocd may trigger fixed action 
patterns sequences of primitive behaviors that while no longer 
relevant to 20thcentury life continue to be stored within the 
brain dr judith rapoport of the national institute of mental 
health a pioneer in ocd treatment sees models for human 
compulsions throughout the animal world in the hoarding behavior 
of squirrels for example or the grooming rituals of rats 
among the most valuable resources for researchers are the 
growing numbers of ocd victims coming forward for treatment but 
many more remain hidden away 
typically they dont camp on your door turner says two 
percent of the population is still a huge number of people were 
not seeing them

editors note growing herds of california sea lions that 
converge on puget sound each fall are becoming a nuisance raiding 
the fisheries and getting in the way of divers its a catch 22 for 
environmentalists that the law intended to protect endangered 
marine mammals also has produced a threat to some endangered fish 
</TEXT>

fishermen divers and coastal residents on puget 
sound are being frustrated by large herds of sea lions and harbor 
seals feasting on bottom fish salmon and endangered steelhead 
trout headed upstream to spawn 
the federal law that protects endangered whales and other marine 
mammals prohibits killing the sea lions which kill and eat more 
than half of the steelhead run each year 
up to 2000 sea lions converge on puget sound each fall and 
their numbers are on the rise wildlife experts say 
in addition to their threat to the fisheries floats designed as 
divers rest spots are typically crowded with barking sea lions 
and at least one ferry dock has reeked from their droppings 
california sea lions arrive from their sunny summer climes off 
california in october and november and stay in the northwest into 
april and may before migrating back south 
sea lions and harbor seals which reside yearround in the same 
area have flourished under the 1972 marine mammal protection act 
originally designed to save whales sea otters and other marine 
mammals including some seals and sea lions whose numbers were 
decimated over the past 100 years 
people like to watch the bears at yellowstone park but if 
they get into the garbage cans or pose a threat they are taken and 
removed and if they return once or twice the animals are 
destroyed says james schmidt of trout unlimited in seattle 
one learns it from the other you have to learn to eliminate 
the ones that have learned to go to the garbage dump 
the learning process that brings bears to dumps in parks is the 
same learning process that has attracted sea lions to the ballard 
locks in seattle where salmon and steelhead must use a fish ladder 
to gain access to fresh waters of lake washington and the streams 
where they spawn 
once one sea lion learns the fish are easy pickings he brings 
his buddies scientists say 
its just got worse and worse since 1980 says susan ewing 
spokeswoman for the washington department of wildlife she said 
that while a few sea lions used to show up up to 26 sea lions are 
expected to be on hand at the fish ladder when steelhead start 
running this month 
last winter about 800 wild steelhead managed to spawn with sea 
lions blamed for killing more than that number the previous 
winter less than 500 fish escaped to spawn 
a group of commercial and sport fishermen had sought changes in 
the marine mammal protection act this year that would have allowed 
federal fisheries managers to shoot sea lions that encroached on 
the fish 
jerry pavletich of the salmon and steelhead council of trout 
unlimited notes that various efforts to chase away the sea lions or 
net off the fish ladder approach have failed 
unless the sea lions are somehow driven off he says the 
endangered wild steelhead could be goners 
despite efforts by fishermen congress decided against giving 
managers the option of killing the sea lions 
i think congress refused to bite the bullet pavletich says 
its understandable its a very emotional issue there is strong 
support to protect marine mammals at any cost even at the cost of 
our fisheries resources and that is unfortunate 
congress did however continue the act five more years and is 
calling for research into fisheries and mammal resources in the 
north pacific a move that some fish managers applauded 
a large environmental coalition led by greenpeace also was 
pleased with the outcome in congress 
ben deeble northwest ocean ecology campaigner for greenpeace 
says congress simply didnt believe the marine mammals should be 
subject to control by lethal means because of the one problem case 
in puget sound 
pavletich says the law allows parties to petition for a review 
of marine mammal populations and the head of the us department of 
commerce could authorize shooting the sea lions in some cases 
joe scordino marine mammal coordinator for the northwest 
regional office of the national marine fisheries service says the 
sea lion hasnt been endangered since it was hunted in the 1920s 
guy thornburgh executive director of the pacific marine 
fisheries commission in portland ore says he would like to see a 
regional management council for marine mammals like the fisheries 
commission to develop a policy on marine mammal management 
according to scordino an estimated 1000 to 2000 sea lions 
feed in puget sound each year from fall to spring each year 
their numbers and the length of their stay appear to be on the 
rise scordino says 
there may be as many as 4000 more sea lions fattening up each 
winter in british columbias georgia strait and as many as 157000 
may inhabit west coast waters altogether 
while direct links between sea lions and hake or whiting 
stocks havent been established cyreis schmitt a state fisheries 
marine biologist said the fishery has plunged from an estimated 45 
million pounds in 1983 to 14 million pounds this year 
she said the fishery may have to be closed for a couple of years 
if its to be saved 
sea lions were estimated to have eaten up to 2 million pounds of 
hake this year while fishermen were allowed to take only 500000 
pounds 
pat gearin biologist with the national marine fisheries 
service says hake a much slower fish than salmon or steelhead 
was found in 68 percent of sea lion scat studied in the sound in 
1987 
meanwhile harbor seal populations in northwest coastal waters 
have increased 10 percent a year since 1976 they forage freely in 
areas where they used to be shot by fishermen scordino says 
more than 75 percent of the gillnet salmon fisheries at grays 
harbor and willapa bay are being destroyed by harbor seals he 
says adding i think were just seeing the tip of the iceberg 
fortunately scordino says tackling sea lion nuisance problems 
unrelated to fisheries has been a lot easier 
large timber floats for divers at the edmonds underwater park 
were recently replaced with smaller foam floats that the basking 
barking sea lions cant leap onto a floating platform at the local 
ferry dock has been fenced off so the stench from the beasts is 
dissipating

editors note in the large colonies of hmong refugees in st 
paul minn and fresno calif police are noticing a dramatic 
increase in the use of opium a powerful narcotic that was part of 
the culture in southeast asia federal customs agents have seized 
450 shipments of opium bound for minnesota in the past five years 
and they figure thats only a fraction of the amount that got 
through 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in the coldcream containers mailed to 
xiong yer khang from laos us customs inspectors discovered globs 
of a black tarlike substance 
it was opium police say a powerful narcotic from which heroin 
and morphine are derived its also part of a culture many hmong 
refugees werent willing to leave behind in southeast asia 
federal and local authorities say opium smoking is on the rise 
in hmong communities across the country 
its very cheap very available and were seeing more young 
people addicted says dr joseph westermeyer who oversees the 
treatment of hmong opium addicts at the university of minnesota 
hospital in minneapolis 
it looks like the coming thing says police lt joe carvalho 
of fresno calif where police recently pulled more than 5000 red 
and violet opium poppies from a hmong familys backyard garden 
we expect a lot of the hmong community are using opium because 
its an accepted practice in their own country were just trying 
to be more aware of whats happening in the hmong community 
communicate to them that it is not accepted 
the hmong who fought on the american side during the vietnam 
war fled to the united states from their native laos by the tens 
of thousands after the end of the war 
no one knows how many hmong refugees are smoking opium but 
experts say the stress of adjusting to a radically different 
environment accelerates the slide toward addiction 
the stress frustrations prejudices language problem and 
family problems probably contribute to heavy opium use says 
david yang a hmong community services officer with the st paul 
police department 
the drug hinders the process of learning to succeed in a new 
culture in the united states i have never seen an opium user 
who has a fulltime job yang says 
they are taking food literally out of their families 
mouths adds westermeyer an expert on hmong culture who spent a 
decade working in laos theyre not learning the language not 
learning to survive 
fresno with about 20000 hmong and st paul with about 
12000 have the largest us populations of the refugees from the 
mountains and jungles of laos smaller hmong communities are 
scattered around the country in wisconsin missoula mont 
providence ri and elsewhere 
st paul police gained a new appreciation of the opium problem 
last winter when federal customs agents showed them a computer 
printout of 450 minnesotabound shipments seized in the last five 
years says police lt richard dugan head of the narcotics unit 
the seized shipments believed to be only a small fraction of the 
number that made it through ranged in size from a few ounces to 
more than 10 pounds 
khang 39 whom police believe is a major opium supplier to st 
pauls hmong is awaiting trial on a charge of narcotics possession 
with intent to distribute as well as a federal narcotics 
importation charge authorities arrested him in march after 
intercepting the coldcream shipment and then keeping his home 
under surveillance 
minnesota authorities worry that seizures havent kept pace with 
the flow of the drug into the area 
there is just one other opium case pending in st paul now 
dugan says there have been only about 10 opium arrests in the twin 
cities area in the last decade says dick hendrie us customs 
narcotics group supervisor in minneapolis 
in californias sacramento valley seizures of opium have 
increased substantially over the last couple years says orve 
hendrix resident agent in charge of the us drug enforcement 
administrations fresno office 
what were once a few ounces now are 10 pounds or so at a 
time he says 
police have sometimes been overly tolerant of opium use by the 
hmong 
there was a feeling how can you prosecute this poor old man 
who fled his country and brought his custom with him dugan 
says and how do you prosecute someone who doesnt realize he 
broke the law 
in his 1983 book poppies pipes and people opium and its use 
in laos westermeyer notes that opium is commonly used as 
medicine by a native population short on doctors and pharmacies 
and by custom he says respectable households keep some on hand 
for guests and special occasions 
but westermeyer maintains that heavy use of the poppys fruit is 
no more accepted in laos than it is here 
in contrast to st paul and fresno police in green bay wis 
and missoula mont report no opium problems in their sizable 
hmong communities 
the hmong people in montana have acclimated very well says 
missoula police capt bill foust to my knowledge there is no 
opium use either that or were not on the ball 
dugan says we know theres a lot of it coming in but we 
dont see the problem on the street 
theres always the possibility it will seep out of the hmong 
community into the general population then we do have a problem 
end adv for sunday nov 13

editors note hes a pennsylvania prosecutor with a penchant 
for performing getting his message across to the jury with a few 
lines from a song paul petro doesnt claim to be another 
pavarotti or even a prince but to him singing is more effective 
than boring speeches 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
they call him the singing prosecutor a 
legal eagle given to serenading the judge and jury 
his trials one critic says have taken a turn for the verse 
a judge complains that singing in court makes light of serious 
business 
no matter says assistant district attorney paul petro singing 
often beats a lot of talking 
i dont fancy myself a singer but i think its an effective 
means of communication petro says 
in recent months the 55yearold prosecutor has entertained 
courtrooms in southwestern pennsylvanias washington county with 
excerpts from home sweet home moonlight and roses and 
pennies from heaven 
a trial attorney can be very effective if he uses references 
to literature or poetry that are known by everybody petro says 
frankly i dont think theres anything different in reciting 
say a famous quotation or excellent poem than singing a couple 
lines of a song after all when you think about it the best 
writers of concise english are really the lyricists 
his latest tuneful tour de force came during the september 
trial of a woman charged with stealing two country music cassettes 
from a department store 
every time it rains it rains pennies from heaven petro 
crooned during his opening argument dont you know each cloud 
contains pennies from heaven youll find your fortune falling all 
over town 
he suddenly switched from song to speech without missing a beat 
ladies and gentlemen of the jury the defendants fortune was 
falling all over gee bee department store he recalls telling the 
jury then he says i went into the facts 
singing helps to focus the jurys attention to certain things 
and to listen to the arguments petro says but in the great 
majority of cases the jury will follow the facts 
robert mcgrew jury foreman for the retail theft trial said the 
guilty verdict indeed was based on testimony and evidence 
singing just didnt seem appropriate but thats my opinion 
we didnt discuss it says mcgrew 49 who manages a welding and 
fabricating business 
juror tony gregor 71 a retired feed mill worker laughed out 
loud and slapped his knee when petro broke into pennies from 
heaven 
i was surprised you very seldom hear anybody singing that 
song gregor says chuckling everybody was laughing something 
new you know 
washington county common pleas judge david gilmore was not 
amused it was the second time petro had burst into song in his 
courtroom 
i dont think anything hes done has been prejudicial or i 
would have stopped it gilmore says my only objection is that 
it makes light of what is a very serious matter 
the observerreporter newspaper noted on the editorial page 
following the retail theft trial that petro has done nothing 
really wrong here other than to trivialize the judicial system 
save us from the singing prosecutor the headline pleaded 
his trials take a turn for the verse managing editor park 
burroughs wrote 
criticism much of it tongueincheek also has come from 
defense attorneys one lawyer suggested that petro consider 
jailhouse rock 
of course thats not my speed nor would i petro said 
that would be inappropriate 
petro insists his musical selections always are relevant 
thankfully few and far between and in good taste 
he chose home sweet home for his opening argument in a 
february murder trial before gilmore his courtroom singing debut 
to indicate this great tragedy occurred in a guys home 
it just seemed right to sing says petro a baritone i 
didnt bother to ask anybody probably its a good thing i didnt 
they would have said youre nuts 
in may petro put on another a cappella performance this time 
the first line of moonlight and roses to show that an alleged 
burglary occurred on a moonlit night 
pennies from heaven was petros most spontaneous rendition 
he decided to give the defendant some special treatment for 
fear she might be acquitted because of the relative insignificance 
of the alleged crime 
in all three instances its something ive felt is 
appropriate he says i feel its proper its not demeaning 
were not reducing the courtroom to a variety show 
petro is modest about his signing talents 
ive sung in the church choir but ive never pretended to be 
a soloist he says 
every time hes sung hes won as a result washington county 
district attorney john c pettit doesnt object 
paul does a good job pettit says i entrust to him some 
of the more difficult and complicated cases that come into the 
office if from time to time he feels a certain thing is going to 
aid him in making the jury understand his point then i certainly 
dont see anything wrong with it 
for petro verse is superior to verbosity 
i dont know if youve ever bothered to read court opinions 
he says theyre not considered great literature i mean theyre 
wellwritten but theyre not the type of material that really 
stimulates people 
singing on the other hand is very effective i think the 
people like it no question about it because unfortunately too 
many speeches in the courtroom are boring 
petro has no idea when or what hell sing next 
to use a pun he says youve got to play it by ear

creator and host of the syndicated tv show lifestyles of the rich 
and famous robin leach doesnt take himself seriously we are 
not doing anything constructive he says its entertainment to 
make people smile and laugh or to nudge their neighbors and say 
isnt that disgusting

robin leach isnt rich or famous 
according to the foremost authority on the subject robin leach 
to be rich you have got to start at 50 million says the 
host and creator of the syndicated television show lifestyles of 
the rich and famous 
and although leach cant go to the local supermarket without 
being accosted by autograph seekers he doesnt consider himself a 
celebrity 
i am two people i sit and watch the show and thats a cartoon 
character i see on the screen leach says in an interview at his 
home on a lake in this western connecticut city 
as the man responsible for persuading millionaires and 
celebrities to open their homes and reveal their bank balances in 
televised interviews the 47yearold leach has made the elite and 
their toys his specialty 
the son of an office manager leach left school at age 15 he 
was working as a night news editor for londons daily mail when he 
became disillusioned with his low wages and decided to take a year 
off 
id never been to america and id never been to australia and 
i flipped a coin and it came out heads for america says the 
native of harrow england it was the biggest giggle it was the 
biggest adventure of my life 
he arrived in new york city 25 years ago with just 135 
i did not know a soul i had no contacts i had no nothing 
he says but within a day he had changed his mind about staying 
for just one year 
it was one of those things that i could never explain that i 
could never put into words but i felt that i had arrived home 
he says 
after a threemonth stint selling shoes at a department store 
leach went to work for the new york daily news 
he later started his television career reporting for the morning 
shows on kabctv in los angeles and wabctv in new york he joined 
cable news networks people tonight in 1980 and went on to 
become a reporter for entertainment tonight lifestyles was 
launched in 1983 
from the time he started work as a newspaper reporter leach has 
been interested in the world of entertainment attributing his 
fascination to the strange and interesting people who populate 
it 
a divorced father of three sons leach now travels more than 
300000 miles a year to film lifestyles and its offshoots 
runaway with the rich and famous and fame fortune and 
romance 
all three programs are produced by televison program 
enterprises a division of telerep inc lifestyles airs in 19 
countries including england which finally bought the show this 
year 
leachs threebedroom home is a long way from the shabby hotel 
room with a hot plate he rented the day he arrived in the united 
states but compared to the opulence of lifestyles he lives 
modestly 
there is a sunken bathtub in his bedroom a whirlpool bath in an 
annex off the kitchen and two jet skis bob on the lake at the end 
of an english flower garden the wine in the cellar however 
is from local vineyards and a solitary chrysler is parked in the 
driveway 
leach attributes the success of lifestyles to hard work and 
the american dream 
america has always been basically and traditionally a country 
where winning is very important he says 
the american dream is very much alive and well 
entrepreneurial behavior where hard work is rewarded with success 
is the only system in the world that works 
leach works 16 to 17 hours a day seven days a week as the 
executive producer and part owner of the three television shows 
as for being a television show host he says its a job like 
anyone elses job 
the difference is that i dont take what i do very seriously 
how can you its not brain surgery were not saving lives we are 
not doing anything constructive 
its entertainment to make people smile and laugh or to nudge 
their neighbors and say isnt that disgusting 
he assumed the role of host reluctantly when he could find no 
one suitable to do the job and then cultivated a voice that would 
ensure that his listeners stayed tuned 
leachs loud brash madefortelevison english accent has 
become a trademark of lifestyles 
some people actually think its nice he says thats 
extraordinary its not meant to be nice 
he says the knack of getting people to appear on his shows boils 
down to the fact that he was often the first one to ask 
jacqueline kennedy onassis greta garbo and marlene dietrich are 
the only famous people whom leach is still anxious to interview 
but he says he hasnt even scratched the surface of potential 
guests 
moreover with plans for two new shows and contracts for two 
books including a cookbook of recipes enjoyed by the rich and 
famous there is plenty ahead for leach 
a memoir will come later says leach who eventually wants to 
retire to the caribbean and write 
there is no burning hemingway novel inside me but just one 
book of all the madness that went on in the world of the rich and 
famous he says

editors note unlike other proud fighting units in world war 
ii such as the paratroopers and pt boat crews the glider pilots 
have been all but forgotten the national world war ii glider 
pilots association which has about 1300 members and was 
instrumental in establishing a silent wings museum in terrell 
texas is dedicated to correcting that oversight 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
they were called the silent wings the men 
who flew them had a g for guts emblazoned on the silver 
wings they wore on their uniforms 
the mass of americans dont know a thing about the gliders 
says bard coatsworth of lincoln a former state commander of the 
national world war ii glider pilots association 
i decided its time that we stop sitting around telling old 
war stories and let the world know about the contribution of 
gliders to the war effort 
gliders owe their military history to the germans who were 
banned as part of the versailles treaty from manufacturing aircraft 
with engines coatsworth said 
they used them to fly demolition experts across the lines into 
france at night to destroy the pillboxes and guardposts 
coatsworth was working at the lincoln aviation institute the 
same place charles lindbergh learned to fly when he heard the 
army was looking for experienced pilots for glider training 
he signed up in july 1942 and wound up at ong flying school in 
goodland kan where he got 25 hours of training landing without 
power from various altitudes day and night 
from there it was on to two air bases in texas and more night 
and day deadstick flying with some practice in gliders made from 
converted power aircraft 
he got his first glimpse of the waco cg4a c for combat g for 
glider in lubbock texas and remembers wondering how could 
anybody fly a thing like this 
the gilder with a wingspan of 83 feet 8 inches an overall 
length of 48 feet 3 inches and a height of 12 feet and 7odd 
inches looked like a big olive green bomber he says 
it wasnt designed to be pretty 
it was an aerial truck coatsworth says but the power 
pilots who criticized it didnt know what they were missing it 
handled like a dream 
although the war ended before coatsworth had to fly a glider in 
combat he did have some rather harrowing experiences during 
training 
once the tow rope broke loose from the power aircraft pulling 
the glider and narrowly missed breaking the windshield of the 
glider the rope became tangled around the landing gear and 
coatsworth had to maneuver the craft through a clearing in some 
trees to land 
snagging the rope would have resulted in a crash he said 
on a night run coatsworth and his copilot had to cut free 
because they were incorrectly signaled that the tow plane was in 
trouble coatsworth and his copilot had a choice of landing on a 
highway with traffic or at a rock quarry 
we set it down about 20 feet short of the edge of the quarry 
in snakeinfested country he says we spent the night on the 
wing until they found us in the morning 
coatsworth assigned to the 66th squadron of the 403rd troop 
carrier group said the cg4a could carry 13 soldiers and a crew of 
two some carried minibulldozers jeeps or mortars 
the gliders were first used in the war on july 9 1943 when 
they carried british airborne troops from an airfield in tunisia to 
axisheld sicily 
in february 1944 gliders carried troops and equipment behind 
enemy lines in burma to set up landing areas to be used in a 
massive air assault that surprised the japanese 
gliders played a key role in the dday invasion of normandy on 
june 6 1944 and saw action in southern france holland bastogne 
and varsity 
they were slated to join forces for a final airborne assault 
on japan proper but we dropped the big one before it came to 
that coatsworth says 
coatsworth says the national world war ii glider pilots 
association formed in 1971 has about 1300 members he estimates 
there were probably 10000 men trained to fly gliders 
the association was instrumental in establishing a silent wings 
museum in terrell texas near dallas where people can view one of 
several restored cg4a gliders and other memorabilia 
my big concern now is that we get our proper place in 
history coatsworth says 
all the other services the paratroopers the pt boat crews 
and the like have gotten theirs and i dont deny them that but 
its time now for the country to recognize the glider pilots

los angeles abcs war and remembrance the sequel to the 
winds of war is more of a megaseries than a miniseries 
filmed at a cost of 104 million it will run at least 30 hours 
making it the most expensive and the longestrunning film project 
of all time 
the first 18 hours will be televised on seven nights over an 
11day period beginning sunday the final 12 hours are still being 
edited for showing after the first of the year however the exact 
number of hours will not be determined until the editing is 
completed 
the winds of war and war and remembrance are based on 
the bestselling novels by herman wouk the first told of the 
coming of world war ii the second is about the winning of the war 
the first miniseries ran 18 hours in february 1983 and attracted 
an estimated 140 million viewers 
the sequel which includes 1785 scenes was filmed at 267 
locations in six countries over a 14month period it has 358 
speaking parts 
robert mitchum continues his role as victor pug henry the 
naval officer who was on the scene for many of the events leading 
up to the war in the winds of war in the new show he is 
promoted to admiral and participates in the major sea battles in 
the pacific 
but the sequel also will feature some new faces in starring 
roles 
hart bochner rejected as too young for the winds of war 
grew into the role for the sequel 
nearly eight years ago bochner met with producerdirector dan 
curtis to talk about the role of byron henry the youngest son of 
pug henry who marries natalie jastrow ali macgraw in italy just 
as world war ii begins 
dan felt i was too young bochner says 
instead the role in the 1983 miniseries went to janmichael 
vincent 
bochner picks up the role of byron henry a few days after pearl 
harbor he is a submarine officer in action in the pacific 
natalie who is jewish is trapped in europe and is trying to stay 
one step ahead of the nazis natalie now played by jane seymour 
is accompanied by their child louis and her uncle aaron 
sir john gielgud takes over the role of aaron jastrow from john 
houseman 
victoria tennant polly bergen david dukes peter graves chaim 
topol jeremy kemp and ralph bellamy return in their roles from the 
first miniseries 
the story bochner says focuses on the family and how their 
lives are affected by the war 
you dont get just an overview he says you get details 
because somebody from the family is usually there you see me in 
the submarine my dad on the battleships natalie at auschwitz my 
sisters husband at los alamos developing the bomb 
since completing the miniseries bochner has also starred with 
bruce willis in die hard and went to argentina for a 
psychological thriller called apartment zero 
bochner the son of actor lloyd bochner made his film debut 
during his college freshman year as one of the sons of george c 
scott in islands in the stream he didnt work again until he 
graduated then played the bad guy in breaking away he has 
worked mostly in feature films and miniseries 
this is the third miniseries bochner has been opposite jane 
seymour in the first east of eden he was her son in the 
second the sun also rises he was her love interest and in 
war and remembrance they are married 
i was working on making mr right when i signed for the 
role he says i read the books to get acquainted with the 
character id never seen winds of war because i was out of the 
country when it came out so i stayed away from it i wanted to 
have my own interpretation 
byron in the beginning is not terribly focused for lack of a 
better reason he gets involved in the navy because of parental 
pressure he had been studying art in europe it was his boyishness 
and brashness and passion that appealed to this older woman 
bochner spent several months in europe for the sequences in 
which he becomes a naval courier and attempts to find his wife and 
child but most of his scenes are at sea aboard submarines 
the navy has only two world war ii diesel submarines so it was 
necessary to tow a boat on display at pearl harbor out to sea 
to prepare for the role bochner spent a week aboard a nuclear 
submarine operating off california 
when we shot the battle sequences i thought at first something 
had gone wrong with the special effects says bochner the 
explosions were so powerful they rocked the whole boat 
we filmed under some pretty tough conditions the temperature 
inside the sub never got below 110 degrees we worked 15 hours a 
day our objective was to recreate life exactly as it was on a 
submarine hot exhausting and frightening

when actress bonnie franklin first tried to land 
the role of frankie in frankie and johnny in the clair de lune 
she couldnt even get an audition 
frankie a wary nevermarried waitress in a definitely 
downscale diner wasnt anything like ann romano the divorced 
working mother of two girls on tvs one day at a time the role 
miss franklin played for nine years 
casting directors miss franklin says think thats who you 
are rather than what you play its real frustrating because i 
know what i can do 
kathy bates and kenneth welsh the original frankie and johnny 
were replaced by carol kane and bruce weitz when kane and weitz 
decided to leave miss franklin put in another this time 
successful appeal to audition 
miss franklin and tony musante known from tvs toma went 
into frankie and johnny on sept 13 after three weeks 
rehearsal theyre enjoying the collaboration so much they want to 
work together again 
were so lucky she says therere only two of us out 
there on stage the trust has to be extraordinary it could have 
been we didnt trust each other and didnt get along 
the play is about the relationship between a waitress and a 
shortorder cook he decides on their first date they should become 
a couple she having been physically hurt and then dumped by a 
longtime lover wants a man in her life but is afraid to allow 
herself to be vulnerable again 
its a wonderful play miss franklin says the more i do 
it the more i love it 
audiences identify with frankie miss franklin says she is 
afraid to be left damaged and hurt again in her life i think 
elements of that are in all of us 
johnny pushes so hard men dont want to see themselves as 
steamrollers but hes saying love me let me into your life he 
finally tells her im not good with people 
i think people get things from the play wherever their own 
pain is children marriage commitment or whatever this is such 
a love story weve all had successes and failures in that part of 
our lives i think thats what affects so many people and terrence 
mcnally writes so beautifully in a certain poetic rhythm 
she saw the play originally miss franklin says after her 
husband of eight years producer marvin minoff saw it with his 
daughter 
i loved it she says i knew i would be wonderful in it 
and i wanted to play it i knew the director paul benedict we 
both worked in norman lears factory he was in the jeffersons 
for nine years as the un representative 
i called him and said i saw your play and i want to replace 
kathy he said ill put you on a list the producers didnt see 
me maybe it was because of one day at a time i wouldnt be 
playing the mother of two kids miss franklin recalls that after 
her broadway debut in the musical applause she had trouble 
being considered for anything other than musicals 
she thought shed have lots of time to see movies and friends 
while acting in new york miss franklin says but finds that only 
from noon till 4 pm can she have a life other than the work 
she starts preparing for the play about 4 pm i take a nap i 
get up and wash my hair i think it is important for the show that 
my hair not have a real stylish cut i bought an ankle bracelet 
three rings and earrings and painted my toenails thats all 
frankie 
i take a good strong halfhour walk to the theater when i 
get there i light a candle put on classical music and do vocal 
exercises theres a lot of talking in this play

back home to los angeles in january i think its important i have 
a marriage i wouldnt mind going back on tv tony and i are hoping 
well get terrence mcnally to write us a series

mayor ronaldo perim readily 
acknowledges it at least 30000 residents of governador valadares 
a tenth of its population are in the united states most 
illegally and others are doing everything they can to follow them 
they dont want to stay there he indicated just make their 
fortunes in the land of opportunity and return home to live in 
the financial comfort that escapes many brazilians in these days of 
economic hardship 
in august 46 brazilians were discovered stowed away amid sacks 
of cocoa beans and coffee on a cargo ship docked in philadelphia 
forty were from governado valadares 
of the stowaways nine escaped from us immigration officials 
and the rest who were sent home vowed to try again 
a lot of the united states has rubbed off on governador 
valadares english commonly is heard along with brazils portuguese 
language on its treelined streets and in it cheery onefamily 
homes goods can be paid for in dollars as well as brazilian 
cruzados 
people speak of traveling to the united states 4000 miles 
north as they do of a jaunt to rio de janeiro 400 miles south 
i worked like crazy in the worst jobs to make enough money to 
live without worry in brazil now said luis deamorim 39 who 
said he spent 20 years living illegally in the united states before 
earning enough money to open a small restaurant in governador 
valadares 
deamorim took 11 members of his family with him when in 1966 he 
moved to america as they call it here he lived up and down

theres no way to earn money here said altair silveira 40 
who first headed northward in 1967 to work illegally on a us 
tourist visa and who has returned regularly since being deported 
in 1969 to visit his son and daughterinlaw in florida 
in america you can save money to start a decent life buy a 
house a car things you could never have on a brazilian salary 
he said 
brazil never has been a major source of illegal emigration to 
the united states but with inflation spiraling at a projected 
annual rate of 2000 percent unemployment at 25 percent and wages 
40 percent lower in real terms than they were two years ago more 
and more brazilians have their eyes on america 
the growing number of brazilians living illegally in the 
united states is a source of concern said clyde bishop head of 
the consular section at the us consulate in rio de janeiro we 
must take firmer steps to reverse the trend before there is an 
explosion 
brazil latin americas largest country has a population of 
more than 143 million 
though precise figures on illegal aliens are hard to come by 
brazils consulate in new york city estimates about 100000 
brazilians live in new york state half of them illegally a 
similar number are thought to live in florida and thousands more 
in boston and newark nj 
according to brazils federal police 125 million citizens have 
emigrated legally over the past three years to the united states 
canada italy portugal and australia but thousands more simply 
overstayed tourist visas or sneaked into foreign countries 
some have unpleasant memories of life in america 
no one likes living in the united states said silveira who 
was deported nearly 20 years ago to the contrary people live in 
such awful conditions to save money that they come back with bitter 
feelings 
there is even a bimonthly newspaper for the homesick the 
tribuna brasileira which is printed in governador valadares and 
sent to some 10000 brazilians abroad 
according to mayor perim the citys economy depends on money 
earned in the united states and sent home each month people who 
have emigrated send an estimated 3 million to relatives at home 
and often the money goes to pay installments on a new home 
in governador valadares new office and apartment buildings have 
risen between chic boutiques jutting above the barren rural 
landscape according to jose tavares who owns a construction 
company 46 high rises are currently being built and more than half

it would be a financial disaster for the city if the us 
channel were closed off perim said the city would literally 
collapse without resources or jobs 
the ties between governador valadares and the united states are 
almost as old as the city which grew up in the late 1930s around 
its rich mineral deposits principally mica during world war ii 
us technicians established mica mines and built a railroad from 
governador valadares to vitoria on the atlantic coast 
after the war mica dropped sharply in value governador 
valadares turned to timber but it soon ran out in the late 1960s 
with no new income sources in sight some 20 residents now called 
pioneers turned to the united states 
during the 1970s years of economic prosperity in brazil plenty 
of jobs were available and emigration fell off but it picked up 
again in the recessionplagued 1980s in 1985 the federal police in 
governador valadares issued 1747 passports 2408 in 1986 and 
3568 in 1987 that number is expected to double this year a 
federal police source said 
here i earn about 50000 cruzados 100 a month but i know 
that in america i can earn at least seven times that amount said 
taxi driver jose reis ill do anything i must to get in 
last year the us consulate in rio de janeiro issued 70000 
tourist visas refusing about 25 percent of applicants bishop 
said this year the consulate expects to issue 95000 visas with 
the same rejection rate with an additional 20 percent probably to 
be turned away by immigration officials at us airports 
a shady market of false documents visas and illegal trips has 
grown up around the exodus 
in just one year the number of travel agencies in governador 
valadares grew from four to 13 most opened their doors with 
offerings of illegal guided trips across the mexican border at 
3000 a person 
despite the financial benefits for the city many in governador 
valadares are concerned by the number of neighbors moving northward

on a recent saturday the tagansky gastronome had 
for sale one fresh green vegetable two kinds of fresh fruit 
pigs heads and trotters and beef that was at least half fat and 
gristle there was no veal no lamb no fresh fish no other kinds 
of pork 
muscovites consider the tagansky one of their citys finest 
supermarkets 
before 9 am about 200 shoppers were lined up across the dirty 
concrete floor waiting to buy soft gray sausages that looked like 
knockwurst others snapped up bunches of onions plastic sacks of 
apples and green unripe cuban grapefruit 
a poster hanging by the bread counter read conserve bread 
its the property of the people 
in the eight aisles of the southeast moscow store and others 
like it nationwide president mikhail s gorbachevs ambitious 
economic vision runs smack into gritty soviet reality in the 
fourth year of gorbachevs tenure what people here euphemistically 
call the food question seems as acute as ever xptis program of economic 
reform depends in large part on his governments ability to improve 
the food supply and convince the public his program is worth the 
greater effort it demands 
in a country that has experienced at least two disastrous 
famines in a lifetime many if not most soviets gauge gorbachevs 
drive for perestroika or restructuring by what it puts on 
their grocery shelves 
nikolai g belov deputy director of the state committee on 
statistics told reporters recently that food supplies reaching 
soviet stores are short by more than 13 billion rubles 2 billion 
at the official exchange rate of the annual need and the 1988 
economic plan 
gorbachev told a key communist party meeting on agriculture that 
even factories in the soviet defense complex have been put to work 
making farm implements with the goal of improving the nations 
harvest and consequently its diet 
life demands that the earth should produce and that livestock 
units should produce because that produce is greatly needed by our 
society gorbachev told the oct 12 meeting 
to better feed soviets gorbachev himself the son of a russian 
peasant has broken with 60 years of marxistleninist orthodoxy to 
call for the leasing of arable land around the nation to individual 
farmers 
for americans accustomed to yearround abundance freshness and 
a choice of supermarkets the food situation in the other 
superpower is frankly bleak at the delivery end of the food chain 
in stores like the tagansky gastronome what the russians call 
deficits chronic shortages are wideranging and frequent 
it is humiliating that we still arent able to feed ourselves 
buying even bread and oil and meat and fruits and vegetables 
abroad the poet yevgeny yevtushenko lamented in a muchdiscussed 
essay published this year the rationing system that we have in 
many regions is our shame 
after 70 years of soviet power some food items regarded in the 
west as staples are rationed in eight of this countrys 15 
constituent republics according to recent reports in the staterun 
media 
food shortages are so acute in parts of the russian federation 
that meat is rationed in 26 regions butter in 32 and sugar in 53 
some regions cover more territory some individual us states 
in the ural mountain city of berezniki meat is so scarce that 
residents can buy only 300 to 400 grams of sausage a month the 
equivalent of five or six goodsized hot dogs 
food is so short in ryazan kalinin and other russian cities 
that their residents stream into moscow and each year carry off a 
halfmillion tons of meat and meat products alone a joke goes 
what is long green and smells like sausage answer the 
moscowtotula train 
the soviet union is no land of freezedried vacuumpacked 
microwavable onestop food shopping either for many finding 
something good for the dinner table is an ordeal and challenge that 
can mean hours of being jostled in line dealing with surly shop 
clerks and frustration over longterm deficits 
you get mad at city officials every time you go shopping after 
working hours or try to get a bite to eat downtown the weekly 
moscow news groused in a recent criticism of the capitals 
staterun stores and restaurants 
many soviets have alternate food sources one yaroslavl factory 
runs its own pig farm and greenhouses to supply employees with pork 
and cucumbers peasants with private plots can sell their produce 
in special markets for more than the price fixed in state stores 
outside the tagansky a man with a moustache hawks persimmons 
from the southern republic of moldavia he belongs to a 
cooperative one of the free associations of producers and vendors 
that gorbachev is counting on to relieve the countrys consumer 
shortages 
perks for top party and government officials include food 
parcels and access to a special network of shops selling meat 
sturgeon caviar and other hardtofind items bureaucrats black 
volga sedans regularly pull up to the rear door of the tagansky 
and drivers enter to fetch cardboard boxes crammed with delicacies 
not all news from the farm is bleak belov said overall 
agricultural output increased 4 percent in the past nine months 
compared to the same period in 1987 there will be less grain and 
fewer potatoes than last year but more corn he said 
but as nikita s khrushchev the late premier once said you 
cant make pancakes out of statistics 
an american food processing expert who visited soviet packaging 
plants this summer estimated that one potato in two never makes 
from farm to market because it is ruined or rots in transit and 
storage 
by improving the way crops are harvested transported stored 
processed and delivered to consumers the country could increase 
production on some foodstuffs by as much as 40 percent gorbachev 
told the meeting on agriculture 
until this is done however deficits will remain an 
exasperating part of soviet life 
on a recent train trip a western reporter offered a cup of 
westernmade instant coffee to a traveling companion a 
professional violinist from moscow 
the man tasted the coffee sighed and said you know our 
soviet instant coffee is better but there isnt any of it

at this 25th anniversary of john f kennedys 
assassination its fair to ask what if he had lived and its 
fair to say that he does live on in the reflections of friends 
and advisers he inspired and in the emotions of millions of 
americans feelings nowhere more evident ironically than at his 
grave 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
mesmerized by the commanding view of 
washington from a hill atop arlington national cemetery john 
kennedy remarked in 1963 that he could stay there forever later 
that year an assassin would strike him down and he would be 
buried near the site he admired so 
in a city filled with monuments and memorials the kennedy grave 
site striking in its simplicity remains to many the nations most 
emotional symbol of life and death of hope and lost dreams even 
25 years after his violent death 
kennedys grave brings out a lot of emotions in people said 
kerri childress the cemeterys historian who was a secondgrader 
when the president was gunned down in dallas on nov 22 1963 
a lot of memories come back people dont just remember 
kennedys assassination they remember that whole period of their 
lives their families their friends people tell me they remember 
smells sounds 
adults weep openly at the grave admirers silently leave flowers 
on the granite bed a blind woman after visiting the cemetery 
dozens of times cried when she saw it for the first time as 
she was allowed to run her fingers over the stones and feel the 
heat from the eternal flame 
theres another eternal flame it burns warmly in the memories 
of those who knew and served with kennedy friends and advisers who 
can visualize him still alive still keeping a hand in the 
direction of his nation 
without question he would have continued to be an extremely 
active publicspirited heavily involved person in all matters 
that would have to do with social progress and world peace said 
lawrence obrien who served as the kennedy white houses liaison 
to congress 
he recalls the late president occasionally referring to life 
after the white house he would have been only 51 if hed served 
the maximum eight years and the talk revolved around academic 
life perhaps at his alma mater harvard university 
instead harvard renamed its government school in kennedys 
honor as a living memorial to the 35th president 
david f powers one of kennedys closest confidants from his 
first campaign for congress to that tragic november day envisioned 
a postpresidential kennedy as a roving ambassador of sorts 
kennedy used to wonder why former presidents werent put to 
better use according to powers who served as a special 
assistant to jfk i think kennedy would have gone to the soviet 
union or wherever was necessary 
childress recalls a delegation of soviet generals visiting jfks 
grave in minute detail they told where they were and what they 
were doing when they heard the news that the president who had 
confronted their own leader over cuba but later joined nikita 
khruschev in a nuclear test ban treaty was dead 
like many americans they wondered what might have been 
obrien and powers doubt kennedy would have run for political 
office after serving two presidential terms but others wonder 
its just possible he might have stayed in politics going 
back to the senate said dean rusk who served as kennedys 
secretary of state 
author and former kennedy aide richard goodwin agrees saying 
that the late president would have followed the example of john 
quincy adams the sixth president was the only one to return to a 
lower public office after serving in the white house adams served 
in the house for 18 years after his single term as president 
he would have run for office and would have stood for a 
continuing voice on national affairs and would now be the senior 
senator from massachusetts goodwin said kennedys youngest 
brother edward m kennedy is the states senior senator 
he talked about two things a kennedy library and writing but 
that wasnt his life goodwin said suggesting such academic 
pursuits were too sedentary for a man of action 
mcgeorge bundy kennedys national security adviser during such 
tumultuous times as the bay of pigs and the cuban missile crisis 
took the idea of kennedy holding public office after the presidency 
a step further 
hed probably agree with ronald reagan on exactly one subject 
that the 22nd amendment is a nuisance bundy said referring to 
the constitutional amendment that limits presidents to two terms 
i think by now hed be ready to try again 
if they had repealed the 22nd amendment lets say five years 
ago this election might be reagan vs kennedy he said it 
would be quite an encounter kennedy would have been six years 
younger than reagan 
if jfk had lived rusk thinks he would still be revered but the 
kennedy years would not have taken on mythic proportions 
he would not have given any thought to the idea of camelot 
rusk said his time in office was a serious time there was 
nothing camelot about it his life was filled with serious 
crises 
though its difficult to guess how a living kennedy would be 
viewed by americans today his grave tells something 
an estimated 4 million visitors each year walk up the steps to a 
large elliptical plaza surrounded by a short granite wall that 
contains quotations from kennedys 1961 inaugural address 
to the northeast through a valley of trees is a clear view of 
the lincoln memorial across the potomac linking kennedy to another 
martyred president to the southwest and up a grassy hill is the 
custislee mansion the onetime home of robert e lee and the 
place where kennedy made his remarks about the beauty of arlington 
shortly before his death robert kennedys grave lies near his 
brothers 
up another short set of steps is a rectangular terrace that 
includes the jfk grave site an 18by30foot area the focal point 
is the eternal flame lit during the interment ceremony by his 
widow jacqueline 
how many of the graves visitors silently echo jfk aide powers 
what might have been he said well never know

americans rank john f kennedy as the nations 
greatest president remembering him with a striking sense of loss a 
quartercentury after his assassination a media generalassociated 
press poll has found 
but kennedys exalted place in history rests more on his 
potential and his personal qualities than on his accomplishments in 
office in the national survey he was rated far higher on charisma 
than on other attributes 
slightly more than onefifth of the 1125 adults surveyed picked 
kennedy as the greatest us president more than named any other 
only franklin d roosevelt and abraham lincoln came close in 
popularity 
among all respondents a plurality rated kennedy as a good 
president not a great one still a majority said they believed 
that had he lived and served a second term the united states would 
be a better place today 
kennedy at 43 the youngest president elected served nearly 
three years before he was shot and killed in a dallas motorcade 
nov 22 1963 twentyfive years later his name is invoked and his 
words are quoted by politicians seeking to assume his mantle of 
popularity 
in more recent years the kennedy image crumbled a bit with 
reports of extramarital affairs and of meetings with a mafia boss 
in the survey kennedys judgment was rated lower than other 
qualities 
most striking however was the depth of feeling associated with 
the slain president more than six in 10 respondents said they 
still felt a personal loss from kennedys assassination including 
many who were children or were not yet born in 1963 among his 
contemporaries seven in 10 feel a loss 
in another gauge the poll asked if respondents remembered where 
they were when they heard kennedy had been killed of those 30 and 
older now meaning they were at least 5 years old then more than 
90 percent said yes 
to order the pantheon of presidents the survey asked who do 
you think was the greatest american president kennedy was named 
by 21 percent lincoln and roosevelt 17 percent each harry truman 
and ronald reagan 7 percent each kennedy has led similar lists in 
other polls over the years 
kennedy was most popular with 30 to 44yearolds who were 
children or teenagers when he served nearly a third of them 
called him the greatest president in other ratings as well that 
group viewed kennedy especially favorably 
kennedy who moved to enforce civil rights laws in the south 
also was rated particularly highly by blacks eight in 10 felt a 
personal loss from his death and 60 percent of blacks called him a 
great president compared to 31 percent of whites 
overall a third of respondents said kennedy was a great 
president and 40 percent said a good one he did better with 
democrats and the lesseducated and as the first roman catholic 
president he was rated highly by catholics 
kennedy also was more popular with liberals but his standing to 
a great degree transcended ideology he achieved his high ratings 
even though 40 percent identified him as a liberal while only 15 
percent identified themselves as liberals 
to gauge the components of kennedys image the poll took 
measures excellent good fair or poor of his accomplishments 
as president his potential for accomplishments had he not been 
assassinated and his leadership judgment and charisma 
although he was rated highly in all categories kennedy drew far 
and away the best ratings for his charisma 60 percent excellent 
next were his leadership and his potential both rated excellent by 
39 percent 
but kennedys excellent ratings fell off on his accomplishments 
and his judgment in both about two in 10 said excellent half 
said good but in his only sizable negative scores more than a 
fifth rated him just fair in both categories 
there was a partisan aspect to many of the ratings fiftytwo 
percent overall said the nation would be a better place had kennedy 
lived and served a second term that included 68 percent of the 
democrats polled compared to 34 percent of the republicans 
doubts emerged on the specific issue of vietnam about a third 
said kennedy would have prevented the united states from becoming 
deeply involved in the fighting there but 44 percent said not the 
rest didnt know 
the survey found considerable familiarity with kennedy more 
than half the respondents 30 and over said they knew a great deal 
about him but such awareness waned among younger adults of those 
1829 only 25 percent shared that sense of familiarity with the 
former president 
the poll conducted sept 614 had a margin of error of plus or 
minus 3 percentage points

stroessner in paraguay king hussein in jordan and kim ilsung in 
north korea bobby kennedy is gone but his son is in the house of 
representatives jfks son john jr who saluted bravely as his 
fathers coffin passed is a strapping handsome 28yearold

percent do today and three out of four homes had telephones now 
93 out of 100 homes have them 
more than half of all homes have video cassette recorders which 
were virtually unknown then radios have multiplied 156 million in 
1963 and 530 million now there is no change in older folks 
complaints about the younger generations taste in music 
kennedy had committed the nation to going to the moon in the 
decade of the 60s and it did but when he died only six americans 
had gone into space since then 12 americans have walked on the 
moon and in all 208 astronauts have been aboard 57 us space 
flights the soviets have sent 138 cosmonauts on 65 flights they 
have female astronauts and so have we 
in 1963 there was no transplanting of hearts but there was 
cocky confidence that virtually any infection could be controlled 
with antibiotics and chemicals that was before toxic shock 
syndrome legionnaires disease and now the dread aids

in fairy tales the beautiful princess marries 
the handsome prince and they live happily ever after 
but jacqueline bouvier kennedy onassis fairy tale 
shortcircuited on a warm day in dallas when her pink suit was 
splattered with her princes blood in the ensuing 25 years she 
has had to write her own happy ending 
the plot twists she has chosen have not been popular with the 
adoring multitudes who would have preferred that she remain the 
national widow her 1968 marriage to greek shipping tycoon 
aristotle onassis engendered outrage and her penchant for privacy 
has bred some resentment 
but once a year she kneels alone at arlington national 
cemetery and once again she becomes the stoic blackveiled widow 
who stood at that spot in november 1963 to bury her husband

it is important to remember what jackie kennedy was to america 
and to the world she was the glamorous whisperyvoiced brunette 
whose appearances caused as much commotion as her husbands so 
much so that he laughingly introduced himself as jackies escort 
she was the fashion plate whose designer dresses pillbox hats 
and white gloves spurred the fashion industry as much as her 
hatless husband wounded the fedora trade 
we are on the threshold of a new american elegance thanks to 
mrs kennedys beauty naturalness understatement exposure and 
symbolism said oleg cassini her official designer 
she was the young hostess of a televised tour of the white 
house the graduate of miss porters school and vassar who said her 
prime responsibility was to take care of the president so he can 
best serve the people she was 34 years old when jfk died a 
striking contrast to her matronly predecessors bess truman and 
mamie eisenhower 
most of all she was mistress of camelot 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
she forfeited that title when she married onassis the aging 
greek who seemed the antithesis of the elegant kennedy many said 
she was a golddigger she never explained the marriage publicly 
never responded to such headlines as jackie how could you 
she by surviving and being with him jfk when he died so 
dramatically became a legend in her own lifetime said a friend 
paul mathias and she cannot live up to it because no human being 
could 
the marriage foundered quickly and ari and jackie lived 
separate lives when he died in 1975 he left her 120000 in his 
will she won a 26 million settlement from the onassis family 
at the same time stories about jfks escapades while he was 
president began to spread stories about alleged liaisons with 
marilyn monroe and the mistress of mobster sam giancana and others 
suggested that jfks most lasting legacy was the war in vietnam 
camelot wasnt what it used to be

with her millions jackie onassis could have done absolutely 
nothing enjoying her 14room apartment on upper fifth avenue her 
estate in bernardsville nj and the oceanfront compound on 
marthas vineyard while raising her two children caroline and john 
jr 
instead she entered the job force in 1978 as an editor for 
doubleday amp co she works there 3 days a week producing ideas 
and acquiring books from authors and agents then guiding the 
writing of manuscripts 
her primary publishing interests are art and entertainment 
never politics her bestsellers have included michael jacksons 
autobiography moonwalk and ballerina gelsey kirklands 
dancing on my grave 
i think people who work themselves have respect for the work 
of others she has said 
her salary reportedly 4000050000 a year is a pittance of 
her net worth estimated at around 50 million plus 200000 a 
year from a trust fund bequeathed by kennedy 
she has made some public appearances in recent years she has 
supported efforts to save city landmarks like grand central 
terminal attending news conferences but saying little and slipping 
out through freight entrances 
on her infrequent appearances at social galas she often dons 
the designs of carolina herrera her date is usually longtime 
friend maurice tempelsman 58 a belgianborn diamond dealer and 
international businessman 
on autumn weekends mrs onassis sometimes rides with the essex 
hunt club near her bernardsville estate she often is among the 
spectators at the annual steeplechase in nearby peapack she does 
not mingle with the locals 
she has been seen sailing and waterskiing off marthas vineyard 
with tempelsman but often eludes the public eye camouflaged in a 
scarf and sunglasses her island house is at the end of a 
2000foot driveway 
the signs out front say no trespassing

mrs onassis battles with paparazzi are legendary she 
repeatedly went to court to thwart the attentions of photographer 
ron galella first obtaining a court order barring galella from 
coming within 30 feet of her or her children then going to court 
to enforce that order 
she declines all interviews according to her spokeswoman nancy 
tuckerman she would not speak on the 20th anniversary of the 
assassination she will not speak on the quartercentury 
anniversary 
but occasionally new yorkers catch glimpses one newspaper 
recently showed jackie a still youthfullooking grandmother 
crossing a street while engrossed in a book oblivious to the 
photographer even celebrityimmune new yorkers stare when they 
spot her jogging in central park or shopping on madison avenue 
you have two compartments your private and your public 
life she once explained i think im more of a private person 
i dont really like to call attention to anything

when john f kennedy jr took the podium at the 
democratic national convention in july the national memory drifted 
back nearly 25 years to the minds image of a 3yearold boy 
saluting his fathers horsedrawn caisson 
but this was no johnjohn on the stage in atlanta this was 
a darkly handsome wellspoken law student who would soon be 
declared americas sexiest man by a national magazine this was a 
28yearold millionaire who had traveled the world and worked with 
the poor 
more than a quartercentury has passed since kennedy and his 
sister caroline now 30 charmed the nation with their oval office 
shenanigans 
they endured the assassinations of their father in 1963 and 
their uncle bobby in 1968 they adjusted when their mother married 
greek shipping magnate aristotle onassis in 1968 
still by all reports john and caroline thrived they did well 
in private schools became proficient in sports made lasting 
friendships and avoided the drugs that so twisted the lives of some 
of their cousins 
like their mother both kennedy children guard their privacy and 
decline all interview requests said family spokeswoman nancy 
tuckerman 
caroline kennedy earned a fine arts degree at harvard then 
served as manager and coordinating producer of the office of film 
and television at the metropolitan museum of art in new york she 
abandoned a career in photojournalism because other people aimed 
cameras at her every time she tried to take pictures

a 1250aweek internship in 1987 as a summer associate at a new 
york law firm she graduated from columbia university law school in 
may she gave birth to a daughter rose kennedy schlossberg on 
june 25 
her brother has kept a more public profile 
now an athletic 6foot1 with matineeidol good looks kennedy 
recently was named by people magazine as the sexiest man alive 
like his father kennedy has been described as extremely shy

providence ri where he graduated in 1982 
in the summer of 1985 he starred in a revival of a play called 
winners staged and directed by his fellow brown graduates at 
the irish arts center in manhattan his costar was christina haag 
an actress and his steady girlfriend of the past two years they 
have known each other since they were both 15 
there have been no theatrical experiences since acting is 
just a hobby he once told a reporter 
while an undergraduate kennedy spent a summer traveling in 
southern africa where maurice tempelsman his mothers friend has 
mining and manufacturing interests 
another summer he worked as a peace corps volunteer in 
guatemala later he spent six months working with the poor in 
india 
in 1984 he began his first job in the new york city office of 
business development he also spent one summer as a 1100aweek 
intern at a los angeles law firm 
the young kennedy who lives in a modest apartment in greenwich 
village is a millionaire thanks to a trust fund left by his 
father and the settlement his mother made with the onassis estate 
although he has no personal recollection of the white house days 
he was only 3 when his father was killed he majored in american

hardship support any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival

now the trumpet summons us again not as a call to bear arms

behind locked doors at the national archives 
sit hundreds of dusty boxes the product of the house of 
representatives twoyear investigation of the john f kennedy and 
martin luther king jr slayings 
a decade has passed since the house select committee on 
assassinations ended its work by concluding that kennedy and king 
were apparently the victims of conspiracies but the committee 
documents which scholars say would be important research tools 
appear no closer to being opened to the public 
what were talking about is the records of our political 
history two of the most important events of the 20th century 
said kevin walsh a former committee aide who has led a small group 
of private kennedy researchers in the fight to open the records 
this is about the publics right to know 
most of the work conducted by the warren commission which 
concluded that lee harvey oswald acted alone in the kennedy 
slaying has been opened to the public a move that has helped 
researchers evaluate and in many cases strongly criticize that 
investigation 
but the house committee the only government investigation to 
conclude that conspiracies were involved in either murder ran out 
of money and was dissolved before voting to release its documents 
without such a vote the materials fell under the houses 
socalled 50year rule keeping congressional documents under 
lock and key for a halfcentury 
the late rep stewart b mckinney rconn a member of the 
select committee had taken up the scholars cause in congress 
fighting for a resolution to release most of the documents but he 
died in 1987 
rep louis stokes dohio the committee chairman originally 
led opposition to that resolution but had a change of heart after 
mckinneys death from aids and said he would work for the 
informations release 
that buoyed researchers but the 1988 legislative session came 
and went without any action on the committee documents 
house counsel steven r ross said he expected stokes to act next 
year on a measure that would immediately open some of the records 
but he declined to provide specifics 
the committee sent shockwaves around the world in december 1978 
when it concluded that kennedys killing in 1963 was probably the 
result of a conspiracy pointing to accoustic evidence that 
experts said clearly showed the presence of a second gunman the 
committee also concluded that a conspiracy likely was behind the 
king slaying in memphis five years later 
but in 1982 the national academy of sciences concluded that 
there was no evidence of a second kennedy gunman and that the 
independent experts used by the committee incorrectly analyzed a 
tape recording made from a motorcycle policemans open microphone 
the experts testimony had been the key to the committees 
conclusion before it the panel had planned to conclude that there 
was no conspiracy 
despite the academy study and the justice departments final 
conclusion this year that there was no conspiracy in either 
slaying stokes stands by his committees report 
its a difference between scientists stokes said

after 25 years dallas finally has matched courage 
with cash and will open the sixth floor of the texas school book 
depository to the world 
over the decades the old warehouse has survived arsonists and 
calls for demolition for a time all buyers shunned it all this 
ill will because of a new young order clerk named lee harvey 
oswald who perched at a corner window on boxes of rolling 
readers apparently fired two maybe three rifle shots at a 
motorcade passing below 
now workers are just a month away from topping off an outside 
elevator that will carry up to halfamillion visitors a year to 
the infamous sixth floor where they can view an exhibit on 
president john f kennedy and look out that corner window down to 
dealey plaza 
its a 35 million project 12 years in the making one that 
dallas for a long time never wanted for fear of drawing more 
attention to a tragedy that heaped shame on the city 
what we are doing is facing up to our history said lindalyn 
adams chairwoman of the dallas county historical foundation who 
has made the exhibit a decadelong personal crusade 
the old saying is time heals all wounds said lee 
jackson the chief of the county commissioners who made completion 
of the kennedy exhibit a priority in his 1987 inauguration speech 
its not unusual that sites of tragedy in history only recover 
over some period of time like gettysburg or the alamo or 
yorktown jackson said its taken dallas 25 years to reach 
this consensus 
every day of the year virtually around the clock a steady 
trickle of tourists and tour buses makes the pilgrimage to dealey 
plaza and the grassy knoll they find monuments but then learn they 
honor the citys founders 
they see a 10sentence plaque on the side of the book 
depository the nine sentences noting the spot where dallas was 
settled are followed by this 
on nov 22 1963 the building gained national notoriety when 
lee harvey oswald allegedly shot and killed president john f 
kennedy from a sixth floor window as the presidential motorcade 
passed the site 
and then they invariably count six floors up 
next feb 20 on presidents day the sixth floor exhibit 
will open to the public 
more than 1 million has been raised privately with 300000 to 
go the fundraising effort took years adams said and didnt 
really pick up until jackson made it a county priority 
its easy to misunderstand what were doing mrs adams 
said there is a feeling among many of us who were living in 
dallas at the time that wed just as soon not be reminded 
to permit construction to begin the county advanced 22 
million which will be repaid through the 4 admission charge 
the exhibit will be a maze of historical panels tied together 
with videos and movies produced by acclaimed filmmaker martin jurow 
terms of endearment waltz across texas breakfast at 
tiffanys 
its far more than an assassination museum adams said 
its about the life of president kennedy and his death its 
about the 60s and what dallas was like it puts everything in the 
context of american cultural history 
the nonprofit exhibit will have few actual artifacts no 
rifle for example only an original of the blackbordered 
antikennedy ad headlined welcome to dallas mr president 
that appeared in the dallas morning news that day along with a 
reporters notes and an associated press teletype machine 
there will be 400 photographs many taken by the 22 people who 
were photographing the motorcade when the shots were fired 
the corner window will be sealed by glass panels although the 
actual greenpainted window frame was removed by a previous owner 
the spots where oswalds rifle three spent cartridges and palm 
prints were found will be recreated based on police photos 
the building like dealey plaza is remarkably unchanged from 
nov 22 1963 
the school book brokerage kept its lease in the building for 
eight years after the assassination a nashville tenn promoter 
bought it but failed to raise enough money to convert it into a 
kennedy museum ownership reverted to the previous owner dallas 
oil and real estate mogul d harold byrd who then could not sell 
the building calls for its demolition were turned back because the 
city refused to issue a demolition permit 
in 1977 voters approved a bond package that included 400000 
to purchase the warehouse and convert it except for the sixth 
floor into county office space 
it is now the dallas county administration building jacksons 
secondfloor office looks out on the spot where kennedy was shot 
no one can visit this building regularly and fail to be struck 
by the number of curious visitors jackson said and everyone 
who works here is aware theyre located in a place of unusual 
public interest 
over time jackson said dallas realized the world probably 
would never stop coming to dealey plaza 
over time people finally felt they were able to put the 
experience behind them and they felt like the world was no longer 
viewing them as a community somehow responsible for the 
assassination he said 
over time the community has seen that the interest of the 
world is permanent and enduring

where were you and what was your reaction when 
you heard that president john f kennedy had been shot 
john jovich who was 8 years old when he overheard the school 
principal whisper news of the shooting to his teacher recently put 
that question to 250 celebrities and assembled their responses into 
a book reflections on jfks assassination published by 
woodbine house 
sen daniel inouye dhawaii recalled being near the senate 
chambers and realizing that sen edward kennedy dmass was the 
presiding officer i immediately dispatched a page to tell 
senator kennedy to leave the rostrum for a matter of utmost 
emergency it was then that senator kennedy learned of his 
brothers shooting 
singer billy joel said he first tried to console an eighthgrade 
classmate who was crying he later took a long walk feeling a 
deep bitterness and a despair i had never before experienced in my 
life 
rona barrett the hollywood columnist remembers being at a 
famous palm springs racquet club people came running out of the 
clubhouse screaming that someone had shot jack kennedy 
roy rogers said the assassination proved to me that we have a 
lot more subversive activists in our country than we realize 
former president jimmy carter said he had walked into his 
warehouse to weigh a load of grain when a group of farmers told him 
of the shooting he said he prayed and wept openly for the first 
time in 10 years for the first time since the day my own father 
died 
novelist isaac asimov said all he could think about was that i 
didnt want johnson but i got him 
burt bacharach said he was working on a song with hal david when 
he found out about the shooting he said he left the building and 
went to a bar where he eventually got into a fight with some 
people who were having a good time laughing etc totally 
disrespectful of the moment

rape has been treated frequently in television movies and in 
such films as extremities which featured a remarkable 
performance by farrah fawcett what more can be done with this 
vital but overworked subject 
producers stanley r jaffe and sherry lansing who struck gold 
with fatal attraction have fictionalized a headlined gang rape 
and added a degree of cinematic hype the result is the 
accused which has one scene of pure shock and a riveting 
performance by jodie foster 
the screenplay by tom topor is obviously inspired by the 1983 
case of a poolroomtable gang rape in new bedford mass the 
accused begins with the halfclad battered foster escaping from 
a roadhouse where a college student calls police to report the 
ordeal that she has suffered 
what actually happened in the bar and the game room that night 
was the young woman brutalized by the boozing men without 
provocation or was she responsible for inciting them by her dress 
and banter that is the mystery of the film and it is not solved 
until the final minutes 
the victim jodie foster falls into the hands of an assistant 
prosecutor kelly mcgillis who conducts a plea bargain with 
attorneys for the accused rapists without consulting foster 
mcgillis allows the defendants to plead guilty to a lesser charge 
the equivalent of a judicial rap on the knuckles 
foster is understandably furious that her right to vindication 
had been traded away without her knowledge only when she makes a 
scene at mcgillis dinner party does the attorney agree to defy her 
male superiors and reopen the case it seems hopeless until she 
locates a convenient law and the key witness 
jodie foster is sensational invading the skin of the 
foultalking waitress who seems to antagonize everyone who tries to 
help her what prevents the accused from being an allabsorbing 
film is the character of kelly mcgillis and the subdued manner with 
which she plays it perhaps it is in the writing or the direction 
of jonathan kaplan or maybe she is merely overshadowed by a 
remarkable performance 
kaplan builds up the suspense to the climactic retelling of the 
rape and it is indeed a horrific sequence the producers say it 
lasts only three minutes it seems like a punishing halfhour 
the paramount release is rated r with good reason because of 
language nudity and sexual content running time 110 minutes

gaby a true story rcacolumbia pictures home video 
vhsbeta 7995 rated r 
 
gaby a true story is a remarkable film based on a 
remarkable life 
gaby brimmer was born severely disabled by cerebral palsy very 
intelligent but able to communicate only by moving her left foot 
with the help of a devoted nanny and loving parents she 
perseveres graduates from college and becomes a successful writer 
her proud spirit good humor and insight triumph again and again 
gaby is reminiscent of the miracle worker especially 
because the nanny norma aleando in an oscarnominated performance 
is so central to gabys emergence from her isolation 
rachel levin is wonderful as gaby able to convey a range of 
emotions with just her left leg and very limited facial 
expressions robert loggia and liv ullmann also give excellent 
performances as gabys parents who refuse to give up on their 
daughter and never fail to show their love 
her father says your foot can write the same words as any 
philosopher or poet i refuse to pity you such support gives her 
the strength to fight and win admission to public school 
director luis mandoki takes chances and succeeds dealing 
frankly and romantically with sex between disabled people his film 
also is forthright about the frustrations gaby and a disabled 
friend feel its easy to recognize her anger when gaby writes 
typing with her big toe god is a fly on the wall nanny give me 
a flyswatter 
the movie also succeeds at showing what gaby has in common with 
all young people she tries makeup and beer theres a peace sign 
on the back of her wheelchair she falls in love 
gaby is warm and witty funny and sweet its easy to watch 
on a television screen and well worth seeing

frantic warners home video vhsbeta 8995 rated r 
 
frantic is a modest roman polanski thriller that takes a 
plot idea better suited to an hourlong tv drama and pads it into a 
twohour movie 
harrison ford plays an american heart surgeon who arrives with 
his wife betty buckley for a convention in paris only to have 
her mysteriously abducted from their hotel room while he is in the 
shower 
his desperation and determination to find her lead him into the 
parisian underworld and an unlikely alliance with a young french 
girl of dubious morals emmanuelle seigner she is farandaway 
the most interesting character in the movie and deserves better 
than the fate shades of chinatown that she suffers at 
polanskis hands 
polanski invites comparisons to the great alfred hitchcock with 
this story of an ordinary man thrust into peril through no fault of 
his own but the mood of believable thiscouldhappentoanyone 
suspense is shattered after the first halfhour or so and the film 
becomes a series of improbable chases and confused confrontations 
ford has to carry most of the movie and tries hard but his 
range of expression varies only from extremely anguished to 
somewhat anguished 
all in all a disappointment from the creator of such original 
and unsettling films as knife in the water repulsion and 
rosemarys baby

the unholy vestron video vhsbeta 8998 rated r 
 
one wonders what hal holbrook ned beatty trevor howard and ben 
cross are doing in a limp horror movie called the unholy the 
unemployment lines must be real long in movieland to make such 
celebrated and talented actors want to embarrass themselves in the 
camilo vila film 
the premise is a good one a horrific demon exists and can only 
be brought down by the purest of mortal souls however the 
filmmakers cloud the issue with loose ends and vagueness and a 
plodding plot 
the action such as it is takes place in new orleans where two 
priests are brutally slain at st agnes church enter father 
michael ben cross he takes over the parish resists temptation 
from a young woman named millie who works at a satanic club is 
told by an old blind priest that he is the chosen one and must 
fight a demon 
so far so good 
but then millie finds a book that talks about a demon called the 
unholy who preys on the innocent millie an unbelievable virgin 
thinks the demon is after her naturally to save her soul she 
thinks she should give herself to father michael ahem 
the movie quickly rolls downhill from there culminating in the 
bloody and silly clash between father michael and the demon 
its not a bad diversion for the home screen but if youre a 
fan of the supernatural youll want something a little more 
devilish

closeup reprise david sanborn 
 
the latest offering from david sanborn is a lot like his other 
records melodic upbeat and full of accomplished musicianship 
but its jazz for people who dont really like jazz 
where jazz is improvisational and daring sanborn is arranged 
and methodical where jazz allows a musician ultimate freedoms from 
written music sanborn and band are chained to the notes 
on closeup sanborn and his band of crack sidemen plow 
familiar ground sanborn is an outstanding albeit unimaginative 
saxophonist and the record is chock full of his fullsteamahead 
style and catchy hooks 
he knows how to blow a good riff on tunes such as slam 
pyramid and touch the band lays down a funky 
percussionfilled rhythm track that lets sanborn pick out the 
melody the songs build to a climax that usually has the leader 
hitting a high solid note and then cascading down the keys 
sound familiar see 1984s straight to the heart 
other tunes show a glimpse of a slightly different sanborn 
same girl takes on a mournful quality as a duet between 
saxophone and piano between sanborn and marcus miller who wrote or 
cowrote five songs on the record jt also finds sanborn in a 
lyrical mood as does so far away 
closeup is cleanly produced and includes such session men 
as nile rodgers and saturday night live guitarist ge smith 
who most recently has been touring with bob dylan 
sanborn never misses a note and his latest record makes 
pleasurable listening it makes one wish hed take his considerable 
ability out a bit further on the musical fringe

what a wonderful world columbia willie nelson 
 
you can pretty much tell from the titles what were dealing with 
here this time out willie covers spanish eyes with julio 
iglesias no less moon river some enchanted evening 
to each his own and six other revered standards 
these songs are pretty and willie sings em pretty if you 
liked stardust and somewhere over the rainbow youll like 
this 
but for those of us who fear that willie is becoming the mitch 
miller of the 1980s who wonder what ever happened to the creator 
of such classics as crazy and night life his own classics 
this collection is one more piece of evidence that willie doesnt

back to avalon columbia kenny loggins 
 
when hes on kenny loggins is capable of creating impressive 
pop music the kind of hookladen tunes that sound good on car 
radios and stubbornly refuse to get out of your mind 
when hes not as for most of back to avalon loggins deals 
in ordinary soft rock that really drags over an albums length 
the news here is that back to avalon is loggins first album 
in three years during which time he has carved out a lucrative 
sideline making hit songs for movie soundtracks 
not to go out on a limb too much the new album includes two of 
those cinema tracks the bouncy nobodys fool a recent hit 
from caddyshack ii and the lush meet me halfway from the 
1987 sylvester stallone film over the top 
opening and closing the album respectively they are easily the 
best songs the rest of the lp flows from one midtempo rocker to 
another with breaks for the stately title track and a dancefloor 
cover of the oldie tell her 
loggins also has a visit from the ubiquitous michael mcdonald 
for a vocal duet on shes dangerous youve heard this one or 
something like it before 
on back to avalon loggins sounds comfortable as a singles 
artist but stretched to the limit when faced with the demands of an 
lp

don ameche didnt need to go far to research 
his role as a poor italian immigrant who becomes entangled with the 
mafia in david mamets new film things change 
from the standpoint of knowing the character i probably never 
played one that i knew any better he said my father was born 
and raised in italy and he didnt come here until he was 25 the 
accent was totally his he had it until the day he died 
pop was a man of integrity within the confines of his own 
concept of what was right and wrong the same as gino in things 
change so things were easy as far as knowing what to do with 
this character the only difference is that gino is sicilian and 
pop was from the middle of italy 
ameches performance as the ingenious cobbler who manages to 
beat the mobsters at their own game drew a bestactor award shared 
with costar joe mantegna at the venice film festival and 
columbia pictures is planning an oscar campaign for him the actor 
has another major film coming this fall cocoon the return 
repeating the role that brought him the academy award as best 
supporting actor of 1985 
not bad for an 80yearold 
ameche still looks in wonderment at the events of his socalled 
sunset years he said the oscar came as a complete surprise 
i didnt believe i would win he recalled everybody was 
saying that klaus maria brandauer would win i didnt see out of 
africa but i understand that he was magnificent in the picture i 
was sitting with my oldest son when they announced my name all i 
could say was oh my god 
it meant a lot but nothing like it means today when i look 
at the figure sitting on the living room table it really means an 
awful lot 
ameche could understand the underworld types of things 
change his boyhood was spent in kenosha wis where his father 
operated a saloon frequented by sicilians 
when i was 7 or 8 years old i was sitting in an automobile 
outside pops saloon he reminisced he threw two men out the 
front door and down the three stone steps they wound up a few feet 
from me sitting in the car both were sicilians and the younger 
man was beating up the older man pretty soon the older man came up 
with a knife in his hand with a blade about that long he hit the 
other man three times in the front and four more times in the back 
as he went down 
once i poured water on an enormously powerful man that pop had 
hit across the shoulders with a baseball bat we thought he was 
dead i poured gallons of water on him until he revived 
yes i saw incredible things in that saloon i saw it all 
after four years of drift in college ameches mellifluous voice 
made him a popular actor in chicago radio by the mid1930s 
hollywood was calling 
i made one test for mgm in august of 1935 that they turned 
down he said i saw it and i hated it but then i found out 
later that i hated everything i did 
an agent george frank was his name thought he saw something 
in my test he showed it to darryl zanuck who arranged for me to 
have a test in new york in december of 1935 in january he signed 
me for one picture sins of man with oneyear options for seven 
years 
ameche settled with his family in encino which was a much 
different place in 1936 ventura boulevard was a twolane 
concrete road from sepulveda boulevard to where i lived on louise 
avenue there may have been 40 stores in that two or three miles 
the stretch is now a highrise corridor 
a versatile actor who was equally at home with musicals 
comedies and dramas ameche became zanucks busiest star his most 
enduring film was alexander graham bell when his film career 
waned he stayed active in other media returning to the big screen 
with eddie murphy in trading places 
the onceslick hair has thinned but don ameche remains a 
vigorous figure at fourscore his recipe 
my doctor was a very downtoearth man with a wonderful 
outlook on life he said he was a firm advocate in moderation 
in everything drink all right but be awfully careful of it he 
hated smoking he recommended exercise arguing that what did not 
grow would atrophy and he said the same thing about a mind he 
insisted that if you didnt try to stretch the mind it was going 
to atrophy the same as muscles

pianist krystian zimerman has come a long way 
since the days when audiences only wanted to hear him play chopin 
at the nov 14 carnegie hall gala celebrating the 45th 
anniversary of leonard bernsteins conducting debut with the new 
york philharmonic hell be soloist in bernsteins the age of 
anxiety next year hell record all the beethoven concertos with 
bernstein conducting the vienna philharmonic 
on dec 1 zimerman will perform the north american premiere of 
witold lutoslawskis piano concerto with the new york 
philharmonic and conductor zubin mehta he played the world 
premiere at the salzburg festival during the summer with the 
composer conducting 
im entirely devoted this time to contemporary music the 
32yearold pianist said in an interview i want to show a 
different side because i was usually playing the romantic and 
classical repertory 
zimerman has two new recordings out on deutsche grammophon a 
chopin recital his first chopin recording in eight years liszts 
totentanz and two concertos with the boston symphony conducted 
by seiji ozawa 
dg has a recording of richard strauss sonata in e flat for 
violin and piano by zimerman and kyung wha chung ready to be 
released 
zimerman was born in zabrze poland his father an architect 
started teaching him piano at 5 and soon hired him a teacher 
he was 24 i was 7 zimerman said today i look back i 
think it was a blessing i was his first pupil he didnt have any 
fixed idea of how learning should go i could play the most 
difficult pieces because i wanted to play them 
he said ok to the rachmaninoff piano concerto when i was 12 
i looked forward so much to play this piece i made progress much 
quicker than playing scales 
i had the opportunity to play concerts which i think is 
important for a kid to know what youre working for music doesnt 
exist without the person whos listening to it 
zimerman remembers growing up in the communist world there 
were not toys for children he said a piano at home was a big 
toy you push a key and the sound is coming something really 
incredible i spent a lot of time sitting at the piano we were a 
very poor family i felt somehow rich 
he filled in when his father and his musical friends played 
chamber music i played all the parts you look at a score and 
you can swallow it immediately that gives you a very important 
skill to play chamber music which for a pianist is incredibly 
important 
a pianist can go through life without playing one note with 
anybody else you can phrase however you like he said chamber 
music puts you back into the right way of controlling yourself you 
cant just fly around with phrases as you like 
at 19 he was the youngest of 118 entrants in the 1975 chopin 
competition in warsaw he won 
when you get older it is more difficult to play in 
competitions the pianist said i wasnt aware of many things 
and that helped me a lot my teacher never prepared me to play in a 
competition he said you play your music love the music and 
dont care if someone else plays better or not 
a jurist said to me when i asked him why did he chose me 
when you started to play it was like it was fun we just enjoyed 
it it is amazing that people can hear anything after 30 pianists 
it is the reason i never want to be on a jury i would probably 
have terrible doubts and gray hair after voting if it was the 
right decision or not 
zimermans career began after his win but went slowly for about 
four years he couldnt afford to stay and tour in a town where 
hed played in paris i wanted to hear other concerts to be in 
this atmosphere that was extremely difficult it took awhile until 
i was ready to fill the season with so many concerts i could make 
my existence and could have time to practice and learn new 
repertory 
what helped a lot were recordings and the fact that bernstein 
invited me in 1976 to perform in london he said i think he 
got a tape from the competition in 1979 claudio abbado invited me 
to his first concert as music director of the london symphony to 
open the season 
at the beginning no agent wanted to accept me for anything 
but just chopin zimerman recalled for almost two years i just 
played chopin recitals it is beautiful music but it is like having 
the same dish all the time 
so i have tried to expand in all possible directions on my 
first recital in america i played some chopin and some szymanowski 
he was a great polish composer nobody plays in the west he wrote a 
lot for piano it would make about 10 records and every piece is 
something 
lutoslawski who also is from poland wrote his concerto for 
zimerman over the last 10 years we were always phoning each 
other meeting and talking about it its a beautiful concerto 
solid writing without any tricks 
zimerman is interested in more than music i get 22 monthly 
magazines about all the fields of science psychology and art he 
said i try to resist this specializing in a narrow field if you 
look at a tree and know how it grows you can live more 
consciously

keith richards and mick jagger were like wedded 
jewels in the rock world two diamonds in the rough who made the 
rolling stones shimmer for almost three decades 
now that union has become a little jagged at the edge a feud 
between the guitarist and the lead singer has left the legendary 
groups future in doubt 
over the past two years jagger has pursued a solo career 
richards has just come out with his first solo lp talk is 
cheap and will give his first solo concert nov 29 at the beacon 
theater in new york 
i tell him hes blowing 20odd years of integrity of the 
stones because hes got a problem the 43yearold richards said 
in an interview at his manhattan office where pictures of the rock 
star line the walls 
i ask him whats your problem whats so tough about being 
mick jagger suddenly you got to complete and be fashionable the 
stones dont need that i love the guy and i love to work with him 
but i dont understand this star trip hes on 
on his new album richards has a song especially for his longtime 
friend you dont move me it begins like the stones honky 
tonk woman with guitar and drums 
the lyrics say what makes you so greedy what makes you so 
seedy why do you think you got no friends you drove them all 
around the bend 
the melody and the beat came about like they usually do 
richards said songs come to you you dont make them they 
decide that theyre going to visit for a while 
richards said he wrote the song about jagger on the advice of 
drummer steve jordan who coproduced the lp 
at the time i was going to write it i just dried up it was 
frustrating me he said 
steve said to me when in doubt write about mick hes hurt 
me a lot and i just had to get it out its not entirely about 
mick its about anybody that gets disappointed about a friend and 
has to let it out its a weird mixture of roughness and melody 
richards played you dont move me for jagger who he said 
talked all the way through it but richards thinks the song will 
eventually sink in 
after these interviews hes probably going to go to a room 
and listen to it hell make this a mirror for him instead of just 
having a mirror for him to look into 
jagger and richards have known each for nearly 40 years living 
in the same british neighborhood of dartford for a while as 
children and forming a lasting friendship as teenagers based on 
their mutual interest in blues and rock n roll 
as richards tells it they met on a train around 1960 with 
jagger carrying a pile of blues albums under his arm richards was 
already playing guitar and jagger was doing some singing so they 
promptly began rehearsing together 
they met up with another guitarist brian jones and shared a 
flat in london starving as richards recalls and playing music 
they auditioned for a bassist and decided on bill wyman chosen at 
the time more for the large amplifier he owned than for his playing 
drummer charlie watts who had played with jagger in a blues 
group joined the stones in 1963 
the stones began in richards words as young missionaries 
determined to bring blues music to a mass audience their name was 
taken from a muddy waters song and much of their early material 
were covers of blues and soul classics 
in 1965 the last time became their first selfwritten 
single to reach the top 10 then came satisfaction no 1 in 
england and the united states and still the stones most famous 
song 
they had the best of both worlds for a while critics loved the 
stones naming them the worlds greatest rock n roll band 
the fans loved them not just for their music but their 
belligerent attitude 
that attitude came at a price in 1967 jagger and richards were 
arrested for drugs and briefly jailed although the charges were 
minor jagger for possession of four amphetamine tablets and 
richards for allowing marijuana to be used on his premises both 
were given lengthy sentences and the groups future was in doubt 
after a public outcry they were released and the stones bounced 
back in 1968 with the single jumpin jack flash and the album 
beggars banquet 
jones however was suffering from the strain of repeated drug 
busts and losing his girlfriend anita pallenberg to richards he 
made only a minor contribution to beggars banquet and in june 
of 1969 announced he was leaving the stones because of musical 
differences he was found dead in his swimming pool a month later

mick taylor a 20yearold blues guitarist replaced jones and 
played on some of the stones greatest albums let it bleed 
sticky fingers and exiles on main street he left the group 
in 1974 and his replacement ron wood is still with the band 
wyman once noted that the stones had always been able to 
understand their own abilities and limitations jagger was the 
singer jagger and richards and occasionally wood the 
songwriters wyman the bass player and watts the drummer 
unlike their onetime rivals the beatles the rolling stones had 
each accepted their roles but richards sees jaggers concentration 
on his solo career as a departure from that way of thinking 
mick and i used to pride ourselves on watching these new bands 
screw up and make these obvious mistakes now its happened to 
us he said 
what happened was not just jaggers recording of two solo 
albums but his refusal to tour behind the stones most recent lp 
1986s dirty work 
i made the record to go on the road and suddenly the rug was 
pulled out from under that richards said he took the stones 
for granted and thought he could just hire another stones around 
the corner 
richards once brushed off the idea of making a solo album 
believing that bands splintering up for individual members to 
record their own stuff is pointless why the change of heart 
because if i dont work i go mad he said at least i fear 
id go mad also over the last couple of years i found the people 
i wanted to work with people kept asking me to do it 
richards makes no claim to being a natural singer although he 
was a soprano in the choir at westminster abbey and the festival 
royal hall for three years my voice broke and that was that my 
career has gone downhill ever since he said 
but he has a way of putting across a song 
richards has a generous supply of friends on hand for talk is 
cheap bassist bootsy collins and keyboardist bernie worrell of 
parliamentfunkadelic fame producer willie mitchell and the 
memphis horns session guitarist waddy wachtel and many others 
mick taylor is also on the record playing on i could have 
stood you up a song that shows chuck berrys influence on 
richards berrys longtime keyboardist johnny johnson plays on 
the cut 
richards met johnson during hail hail rock n roll the 
critically acclaimed concert film on berry 
its been 30 years since richards first heard berry and became 
his most famous fan the rolling stones first single was a cover 
of berrys come on the stones also recorded carol let 
it rock around and around and several other berry songs 
originals such as brown sugar and star star are openly 
patterned after berrys music 
richards said exposing berry and other black artists to white 
audiences was the primary reason the stones were formed 
we were idealistic he said the initial reason for 
putting the band together was not to make the rolling stones stars 
we just wanted to turn people on to muddy waters and jimmy reed we 
figured if we could play stuff good enough then other people would 
want to know where we got it 
ironically the stones developed a sound so distinctive that 
listeners were often unaware where such songs as time is on my 
side and its all over now came from 
but now the stones are struggling to continue the early 
obstacles no longer exist they no longer have the beatles to 
compete with their days as rocks bad boys are long gone 
it can certainly be pulled back together richards said 
the positive side is the stuff ive learned the last two years 
just having that breather some fresh air 
wood has favored a reunion all along wyman has suggested the 
group call it quits jagger struggling with his solo career has 
said hed like to record with the stones again watts has left it 
for the others to decide 
richards is optimistic he sees another stones album coming out 
in 1989

isabel allende is a storyteller eva luna 
her third novel is the story of a storyteller 
i come from a long order of tradition allende said in a 
recent interview i used to listen to the maid and cook tell 
stories in the kitchen i loved that ive read stories since i was 
very little i grew up with storytelling 
eva luna knopf 1895 takes place in a latin american 
country closely resembling chile the title character is orphaned 
as a child and grows up poor working as a domestic but she soon 
discovers she can earn a living by telling stories 
i never realized it was something that i had and that i could 
trade for something else allende said like eva luna i 
realized when i was 40 that i had been trading stories for other 
goods and making a living of it 
storytelling the author explained is a way of preserving 
memory since leaving chile after the 1973 military coup she has 
struggled to remember the environment that shaped her as a child 
i realized about myself that i have lost something that was 
invisible that i could not put in words said allende who 
became a resident of caracas venezuela the only word i could 
think of was roots its memory 
and what allende misses goes beyond specific sights and sounds 
living in a foreign country she struggles for a sense of identity 
if you walk in your own city in your own country with your 
people you hear the language of your own country you have the 
feeling that somehow you know the subtle rules and you know how to 
get along 
when youre taken away from that you dont belong anywhere 
youre all by yourself you have no roots and the memory of the 
past starts fading away 
so allende uses her stories to keep the past alive 
i have the feeling i have lost my family my country my 
friends the accent of my own language she said but very 
specifically the memory something that had been with me 
naturally now im reconstructing every day now its finally mine 
its printed portable i can take it with me 
allende whose father was a diplomat was born in 1942 in lima 
peru but moved to santiago chile at the age of 3 she lived 
comfortably as a child and was spared the poverty under which so 
many in her country lived 
i grew up in a world on contrasts extreme wealth and extreme 
poverty she said i belonged to the bubble that means ive 
been fortunate but i was also aware of that inequality though i 
was always touched by that i never came to terms with it until the 
military coup 
she married an engineer when she was 19 and had two children 
she supported the government of salvador allende a socialist 
elected president in 1970 the author says shes a distant 
cousin he was overthrown by the military in 1973 and executed 
after gen augusto pinochet took over and declared a state of 
emergency he tortured and murdered political opponents and 
censored the press 
allende a journalist at the time recalled the day of the coup 
i left my house very early in the morning and i went to my job i 
saw only soldiers passing in tanks and airplanes and everybody 
hiding in their homes i saw the bombing of the presidents 
palace that very day i had the feeling my whole life was 
changing 
she was an outspoken opponent of the regime and went into exile 
in 1975 leaving her family behind they were later reunited 
when i learned i could be taken into prison with my children 
and have them tortured in front of me it became unbearable i had 
to leave she said 
her first novel house of the spirits was released in 1982 
and combined her strong political beliefs with magic realism a 
writing style associated with such latin american writers as 
gabriel garcia marquez 
you can not be an artist for the sake of art only in latin 
america she said i would say the same goes for any country in 
the world where there is great repression and violence 
magic is also essential allende writes in eva luna 
i was writing a new episode every day totally immersed in the 
world i was creating with the allencompassing power of words 
transformed into a multifaceted being reproduced to infinity 
seeing my own reflection in multiple mirrors living countless 
lives speaking with many voices 
and magic also is part of her roots its a combination of 
legends superstitions myths the indian culture the african 
culture the dreams of the spaniards who came here the possibility 
of finding utopia 
allendes second novel of love and shadows came out in 
1987 and had the same themes of good and evil darkness and light 
that appear in all her works 
she balances eva lunas passionate love affairs with the 
violence and oppression of the outside world 
i think that im surrounded by violence shadows confusion 
the author said writing is maybe a naive attempt to make the 
world more comprehensible more tolerable 
shadows for me are all those things that are threatening and 
have always been there are still there death repression abuse 
inequality mystery things in which im immersed constantly 
allende is divorced from her first husband and recently married 
a san francisco lawyer with chileans rejecting the presidency of 
pinochet in a recent plebescite she will visit the country in 
december 
i froze a country 15 years ago and took it with me she 
said when i go back i wont know where ill belong who will be 
my friend when i go back 
but no matter what allende will go on telling stories 
eva luna can not only trade the stories she can make her life 
better and others around her she makes the world more tolerable 
thats what i try to do all the time

irlene mandrell the youngest of the 
performing mandrell sisters believes shell always be overshadowed 
by her two versatile siblings 
but shes the only one seen weekly on television shes in her 
fourth season on hee haw the syndicated hourlong program of 
country music and corn pone humor 
all three starred in the nbc variety showbarbara mandrell and 
the mandrell sisters which ran for two seasons ending in 1982 
now country music singer barbara mandrell is seen periodically on 
television specials while the remaining sister louise is seen 
primarily in a tv shampoo commercial 
irlene mandrell in an interview between tapings on the hee 
haw set said her sisters are tough acts to compete against 
barbara and louise are great showmen she said it would 
be hard to top them 
but shes moving in that direction with her comic sketches on 
hee haw which is in its 21st season as one of the longest 
running tv shows in history 
on the program irlenes featured segments show her as a 
telephone operator and a highbrow society figure beatrice meadows 
watson also known as bmw 
as the telephone operator irlene is scatterbrained much like 
her character on the old network saturday night variety show 
people are always commenting about the spot i hope i dont 
get you as an operator the call would never get through she 
said 
its fun to do she said you get to dress different and 
use a different accent 
she also appears regularly in segments set in a general store 
and truck stop 
her tenure on the program is a return engagement of sorts 
twenty years ago she was on the show as a drummer in barbaras 
band 
when not busy taping hee haw irlene makes personal 
appearances does some emcee work and appears occasionally with her 
sisters at concerts at those shows mostly at conventions she 
opens the act by singing a number or two then louise sings and 
plays her fiddle followed by a segment by barbara before all three 
join together 
theres some slapstick like on the old network show she 
said on that program she often was portrayed as the dippy sister 
in comedy spots 
i guess they thought im a little dingy she said i miss 
the show a lot we really liked to work together i miss them 
after the show went out of production irlene had two acting 
roles in the love boat series she also did some dancing and 
singing on a road show with the marty krofft puppets who had been 
featured regularly on the variety show 
serious acting though is a career ambition i love comedy 
and im trying to get more involved in drama im capable of it 
anything that came up i could handle 
but for the past two years career moves have been delayed by 
motherhood 
i end up pregnant every time something is happening she 
said the last few years ive been mainly mothering which i love 
they are no 1 second only to god deric is 2 and vanessa is 
about 1 
irlene was born into a musical family in corpus christi texas 
she was raised in oceanside calif until the mandrells moved to 
nashville when she was about 12 
barbara was special even in grade school she recalled 
to me shes always been a superstar i remember our grandmother 
used to tell us not to pound on the piano but she could tell even 
then that barbara had musical talent 
barbara and louise are both honest soft hearted and 
wonderful 
barbara still does concerts and performs periodically in las 
vegas while maintaining a recording career louise meanwhile 
recently has been the opening act for comedian george burns 
the careers of all three are managed by their father irby a 
former singer and guitarist their mother also is a former musician 
sam lovullo producer of hee haw said irlene has done well 
on the long running program 
she came from a show where it focused on three people shes 
adapted well with the hee haw gang

as many as 6 percent of americans may be so 
obsessed with sex it interferes with their lives but experts cant 
agree how to treat these sex addicts or even if theyre 
addicts 
eli coleman a pioneer in the field says theres no question 
that sexual addiction exists and that his patients include men who 
are masturbating 10 to 15 times a day resulting in physical 
injury hiring prostitutes on a daily basis or having multiple 
anonymous sexual encounters without any regard to risk of health or 
commitments to family or relationships 
the concept has become increasingly popular in recent years 
spurring the creation selfhelp groups modeled after alcoholics 
anonymous mary ann miller a psychologist who founded the chicago 
chapter of sex addicts anonymous has estimated that up to 6 
percent of americans are addicts 
however sociologists martin p levine and richard troiden wrote 
in the august issue of the journal of sex research that the sex 
addict theory amounts to transforming sin into sickness 
theres no such disease as sexual addiction or sexual 
compulsion it doesnt exist said levine at bloomfield college 
in new jersey you cant be addicted to sex addiction is a 
physiological dependency on a substance 
he and troiden of miami university in oxford ohio wrote that 
the invention of sexual addiction and sexual compulsion as 
diseases threatens the civil liberties of sexually variant 
peoples like homosexuals 
mental health professionals must remain cautious about 
endorsing concepts which may serve as billy clubs for driving the 
erotically unconventional into the traditional sexual fold they 
cautioned 
while not addictive in the chemical sense these behavior 
patterns are pathological selfdefeating said coleman a 
psychologist in the university of minnesota medical schools human 
sexuality program these individuals display hypersexuality in 
response to feelings of anxiety depression or loneliness many 
describe a sexual act as a fix to some very negative feeling but 
this relief is shortlived and negative feelings recur 
dr theresa crenshaw a san diego physician and sex therapist 
who served on president reagans aids commission said the sex 
addicts she treats want help they dont like the behavior it is 
not ordinarily a diagnosis superimposed from the outside 
its a compulsive behavior pattern the person continues to 
repeat in spite of disruption to marriage or primary relationships 
in spite of selfdisgust 
levine said selfhelp groups like sex addicts anonymous and 
sexaholics anonymous simply try to shut down the sexual behavior 
and not deal with the underlying problem for those who are 
unhappy because their frequent sexual behavior violates moral 
standards 
it used to be that people said the devil made me do this 
now they say my disease made me do this if you enter the role 
of being a sick person youre not responsible for the behavior he 
said 
the treatment is to get them to repress their sexuality 
restrict their sexual experience only to an emotional relationship 
preferably marriage the problem is it doesnt deal with the 
underlying forces that make them feel so worthless about themselves 
its their sense of worthlessness that pushes them to engage 
in sexual behavior that violates their values if you remove that 
behavior you remove the only comfort or antidote they have for 
their misery 
coleman said he and other sexual addiction therapy pioneers 
agree that underlying feelings of worthlessness must be treated 
and that none of them advocate simply suppression of sexual 
behavior 
treatments such as the 30day sexual dependency program at 
golden valley health center near minneapolis help people learn 
how to be sexual in healthy ways while selfhelp groups let sex 
addicts know they arent alone and encourage members to obtain 
professional therapy said coleman who lectures there 
but there is no unanimity of treatment he said some view 
this as a psychiatric conditon and treat it with medications 
others treat it with psychoanalytic or behavioral therapy others 
adapted the methods of treating alcohol addiction 
levine said the sex addictioncompulsion concept appeals to 
most americans because if youre engaging in behavior that 
traditionally has been defined as sin transforming it into a 
disease absolves you of any moral failing 
coleman insisted that sex addicts who seek treatment are 
accepting responsibility and selfhelp groups do not relieve 
them of responsibility but they do try to relieve them of shame 
levine said when a diseaselike label like sex addict is applied 
to people they can be forced to get treatment and that the notion 
of addiction can be used to justify attacks on homosexuality and 
other sex outside of marriage 
a persons sexual behavior should be considered a problem only 
if it makes them unhappy involves an unwilling partner or directly 
harms others he said 
coleman acknowledged that resarchers do not have any objective 
criteria to say who is sexually compulsive or addictive so such 
labels could be used as a measure of sexual oppression of sexual 
minorities 
levine and troiden view the notion of sexual addiction as a 
product of increasingly conservative american values a backlash to 
the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s the upsurge in 
christian fundamentalism increased emphasis on monogamy and 
commitment and fear of aids herpes and other sexually transmitted 
diseases 
hypersexuality was a psychological and medical issue long 
before it was politicized by those who feared it could be 
misapplied to them crenshaw said some homosexual men resist the 
notion of addiction because it threatens what they consider their 
right to anonymous sex with multiple partners she added 
levine said his own homosexuality didnt influence his opinion 
the term sexual compulsion was coined by homosexual therapists to 
explain why some gay men continued to engage in unsafe sex with 
multiple partners despite the deadly threat of aids he added 
the points levine and troiden raise are reasonable ones 
said paul abramson editor of the journal of sex research and a 
psychologist at the university of california los angeles 
abramson said their essay will force a reevaluation of the 
concept of sexual addiction and compulsivity this article has 
engendered a lot of debate about the feasibility of using such a 
label for the purpose of maligning a sexual lifestyle

young americans are more overweight than 
ever a fattening of america that one researcher blames on a 
generation of couch potatoes that spends as much time watching 
television as in the classroom 
rates of obesity among children and adolescents went up an 
average of about 45 percent between 1960 and the early 1980s said 
steven gortmaker associate professor and acting chairman of the 
department of behavioral sciences at harvard university 
a key factor in explaining the rise are 1983 studies that show 
children spend an average of at least 25 hours a week in front of 
the television said gortmaker who speculated that the actual 
number of viewing hours is higher 
television viewing for children is now practically a fulltime 
job equal to the time spent in school he said adding that 
television viewing is up from an average of 18 hours per week in 
1968 
diet a general decline in physical activity and tv commercials 
that reinforce the appeal of highcalorie foods contribute to the 
dramatic increase in overweight youths said gortmaker who 
explained his couch potato hypothesis last month at an american 
dietetic association meeting 
the link between tvwatching and obesity rates holds true for 
adults too he said one study showed that adults who watch an 
hour of television a day or less have a 3 percent chance of being 
obese compared to a 25 percent chance of obesity among adults who 
watch three hours per day 
specifically gortmaker found that between the late 1960s and 
1980 obesity rates went up 54 percent among children aged 6 to 11 
superobesity rates went up 98 percent in the same age group among 
youths aged 12 to 17 obesity went up 39 percent and superobesity 
rose by 64 percent 
obesity and superobesity were measured with a skinfold test 
that does not readily translate into percentage of body fat or 
other measurements he said 
the greatest increase among males was between the ages of 6 and 
11 and the biggest among females was in those aged 12 to 17 
obesity was less prevalent among blacks than whites but that gap 
has narrowed recently he said 
obesity is equally prevalent among wealthy and poor children 
gortmaker found the greatest number of obese youths are found in 
the northeast while the fewest are west of the mississippi river 
obese children face health risks including hypertension 
psychosocial damage respiratory and orthopedic problems they 
also tend to become overweight adults gortmaker said 
to counter the trend he recommended individualized programs to 
target overweight youth and school and communitybased nutrition 
programs 
in another presentation john foreyt an associate professor at 
baylor college of medicine in houston reported that dieting has 
become the norm among american women and has become common among 
young children 
we have become a nation obsessed with body shape body size 
women in particular are not satisfied with their bodies today 
either size or shape he said its not uncommon to see 
children in second third and fourth grade begin to abnormally 
restrict their caloric intake 
one study revealed that a group of wellmeaning parents fearful 
that their infants would become obese actually caused nutritional 
dwarfing in their babies by restricting their food intake 
although the average american man would like to lose one pound 
the average woman wants to lose eleven pounds he said 
why is this we today have the first generation of girls 
growing up whose mothers had tremendous pressures to diet 
popular images including beauty queens and models feature 
women who typically weigh only 82 percent of average body weight 
foreyt said warning that such images can have harmful 
psychological effects on women who compare themselves to these 
very very skinny women 
chronic dieting cycling can lead to harmful food 
obsessions emotional problems including depression anxiety and 
withdrawal and physical changes from sleep disturbance to lowered 
metabolic rate that can inhibit weight loss 
foreyt urged health care professionals to address the underlying 
psychological issues eating habits and unattainable goals that 
contribute to chronic dieting and said mild obesity in women 
does not constitute a health risk for women

archaeologists are starting to study 
wanapum and palouse villages up to 2500 years old and more modern 
nonindian settlements that have been preserved largely because of 
national security 
the 126 archaeological sites 20 of them nonindian lie 
within the 570squaremile hanford reservation that makes fuel for 
nuclear weapons 
its an irony that the protection offered hanford because of 
its national defense role allowed these sites to be protected 
said james chatters who was hired last year as the first hanford 
archaeologist 
the majority of archaeological deposits throughout this region 
have been destroyed or covered by hydroelectric development 
agricultural activities and domestic and industrial construction 
chatters said as he crouched inside a stone hunting blind created 
by indians thousands of years ago 
the heavy security that kept the public out of the sprawling 
federal plutonium production site for more than 40 years also 
preserved a collection of indian villages cemeteries and artifacts 
the arid hanford site was once home to 3000 wanapum and palouse 
indians who lived along the columbia river and stalked deer and 
salmon they went to reservations and up to 2000 whites moved in 
at the turn of the century but the area remained largely empty 
until the government created the nuclear reservation in 1943 as 
part of the manhattan project 
officials for battelles pacific northwest laboratories which 
contracts most hanford research recently arranged the first press 
tour of archaeological sites reporters were taken to the remains 
of a large indian village and to the hunting blind essentially a 
round stone hiding place built into the side of a canyon where 
hunters waited to kill passing deer 
they are among the most dramatic remains of 10000 years of 
human activity in the area said chatters who is developing a plan 
to manage and preserve the sites there are probably more intact 
archaeological sites here than anywhere else in the us the 
majority of the sites dont seem to have been disturbed 
perhaps the most important discovery was the site of a large 
wanapum indian village which at one time had at least 60 housepits 
and may have been occupied for 2500 years he said it is one of 
the two largest in the northwest along with the strawberry island 
site at the mouth of the snake river 
the village is now a series of circular depressions overgrown 
with weeds along with tool fragments animal bones and other signs 
of human habitation 
the homes were pits dug into the ground and covered with wood 
and mat roofs averaging about 400 square feet and sheltering 
around a dozen people chatters said there has been no excavation 
of the site yet 
hanford was where the wanapum prophet smohalla held the first 
washat dance which became central to the washane religion 
still practiced by some indians on the nearby colville nez perce 
umatilla warm springs and yakima indian reservations chatters 
said 
but the same security that kept out looters also kept area 
tribes from sacred religious sites those restrictions have eased 
with the end of plutonium production and negotiations are under 
way for more access 
while part of chatters job is advising the department of energy 
on indian concerns the tribes do not fully support his work 
were seen as gravediggers by the indians he said 
nonindian sites include the former townships of white bluffs 
hanford and ringold whose residents were turned out of their homes 
in the 1940s in a parallel with the indian relocation a few decades 
earlier 
also chatters said the nine reactors that produced plutonium 
including the material for the bomb that destroyed nagasaki are 
historic the b reactor the first at hanford is being considered 
for preservation and development as a national historic site 
our purpose is not to judge the social or political merits of 
what were preserving he said the reactors importance is 
much greater than the hunting blinds which fed a few families

women smokers older than 65 were less than half 
as likely as nonsmokers to develop colorectal cancer in a recent 
study 
this doesnt mean women should light up because the decreased 
risk is outweighed by health harm from smoking researchers said 
the study does provide new evidence however that the female 
hormone estrogen plays a role in colorectal cancer they said 
previous studies suggested smoking interferes with estrogen 
function and that estrogen levels might be linked to the risk of 
colorectal cancer better understanding of estrogens role could 
lead to new treatments researchers say 
for the new study researchers looked back at the records of 
25369 white women whose smoking status was known in 1963 to see 
how many had developed colorectal cancer by 1975 
the colorectal cancer risk for 4338 smokers who were 65 or 
older in 1963 was estimated to be 42 percent of that of their 
nonsmoking counterparts smokers younger than 55 ran an elevated 
risk 
the work is reported in the oct 19 journal of the national 
cancer institute by researchers from the johns hopkins university 
school of hygiene and public health in hagerstown md the

children of diabetic mothers may have some 
protection against developing diabetes themselves because of their 
exposure to the mother before birth a study suggests 
their immune systems may be affected before birth in a way that 
makes them less likely to develop diabetes than children of 
diabetic fathers are the studys authors say 
the study dealt with insulindependent diabetes the kind that 
requires daily insulin shots 
children of diabetic mothers run a higher diabetes risk than 
those of normal mothers but by one estimate they are only a 
quarter as likely to develop diabetes as are children of diabetic 
fathers 
until recent decades children of diabetic mothers were more 
likely to be stillborn or die as newborns than were children of 
diabetic fathers some researchers had speculated the early deaths 
may have culled out children who would later have developed 
diabetes thus lowering the diabetes rate among survivors 
but the new study found no support for that speculation because 
it showed that the rate of such early deaths in 1602 pregnancies 
was unrelated to the diabetes rate in the survivors 
researchers cited an alternative explanation for the lowered 
diabetes rate insulindependent diabetes occurs when the bodys 
diseasefighting immune system attacks insulinproducing cells of 
the pancreas perhaps something in a diabetic mother enables the 
fetal immune system to avoid such an attack the researchers say 
the study was done by james warram andrzej krolewski and c 
ronald kahn of bostons joslin diabetes center and was published in 
the october issue of the journal diabetes

new studies cast doubt on the value of 
surgically installed ear tubes to relieve fluid buildup in children 
with middleear infections 
the surgery which costs about 1000 has surpassed 
tonsillectomy as the most common operation on us children but 
pediatricians are divided about the operations safety 
the adverse consequences may be significant compared to 
treatment with antibiotics dr michael pichichero of the 
university of rochester ny said during the recent 28th 
interscience conference on antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy 
he studied more than 100 children about half of whom received 
six or more treatements with antibiotics and half of whom had 
received three or more sets of ear tubes for recurrent middleear 
infections 
roughly 50 percent of the eartube group experienced some 
hearing loss a worrisome consequence of middleear infections 
less than 5 percent of the antibiotic group showed hearing loss 
pichicherio doesnt yet know whether the hearing loss will be 
permanent the eartube group also suffered eardrum damage far more 
often 
doctors at hadassah university hospital in jerusalem israel 
treated 105 babies under age 1 using antibiotics ear tubes or 
both after 10 days they found infection persisted in 63 percent 
of the babies who had surgery 11 percent of the babies who 
received antibiotics and 13 percent of the babies who got both 
treatments 
however there are cases in which there is no alternative to ear

the christmas tree has its roots firmly 
planted in the fertile soil of american tradition nostalgia and 
the ellipse south of the white house 
official lighting ceremonies for the living colorado blue spruce 
will be held dec 15 this year with president and mrs reagan 
expected to preside for their final time 
transplanted from pennsylvania a decade ago it is known 
officially as the national community christmas tree and serves as 
the focus of the annual pageant of peace 
in addition to that national christmas tree a variety of 
smaller trees will mark the holiday season in the capital city 
the national christmas tree association is maintaining tradition 
by supplying a tree for the white house 
the national growers group condcts an annual contest with the 
winner getting to send a tree to the executive mansion 
this year the tree is coming from snowcrest tree farms in 
montello wis operated by irv daggett 
a score of other trees including those at the capitol are 
provided by the us forest service 
the centerpiece tree for the capitol this year will be a 50foot 
balsam fir scheduled to be cut nov 26 in the manitee national 
forest in michigan lighting of that tree will be dec 14 on the 
west lawn of the capitol 
the forest service will also provide trees for the supreme 
court house and senate dining rooms department of agriculture and 
a variety of other federal agencies 
the lighting of a national christmas tree began only with 
president calvin coolidge in 1923 but having such a tree in the 
white house goes back at least to franklin pierce in 1856 
theodore roosevelt once tried to discourage the use of christmas 
trees fearing that their popularity would deplete the forests 
but the tradition older than the nation itself continues 
indeed it likely stems from treeworshiping religions that 
flourished in central europe thousands of years ago 
use of greenery indoors at festival times has been reported from 
the roman era but the first instance of christmas trees was seen 
in the 1600s in germany coming to this country with the many waves 
of immigrants from that nation 
in addition to trees popular seasonal decorations include 
holly ivy mistletoe and on occasion nearly any other green 
plant that can symbolize faith in the coming of spring 
one custom apparently english in origin and currently widely 
popular is kissing under mistletoe the ancient druids and norsemen 
long considered this plant to have magical qualities expecting it 
to cure some diseases promote fertility nullify poison and avert 
misfortune

rockefeller center was still a muddy 
construction site when christmas was first celebrated around its 
nowfamous tree 
that was in 1931 in the midst of the depression when 
construction workers happy to be employed got their christmas eve 
paychecks around the tree they had set up in the dirt 
two years later the formal tree lighting tradition at the 
midtown manhattan site began when the tree was decorated with 700 
lights and placed in front of the then8monthold rca building in 
1936 the rockefeller plaza outdoor ice skating rink was opened 
this years tree lighting with more than 18000 multicolored 
lights takes place at 530 pm dec 5 and will be nationally 
televised later that evening 
the tree is a 75foot norway spruce from raritan township nj 
other christmas attractions at rockefeller center are the 
display of trumpeting angels in the adjacent channel gardens and 
the tubachristmas concert set for dec 11 
the christmas show at radio city music hall runs from nov 11 
through jan 4

christmas season brings a special cheer each 
year to more than 100 unemployed people in the appalachian 
foothills of jackson county a warm happy feeling that comes from 
receiving a longawaited paycheck 
the small army of jobless workers descends on the christmas 
ridge handcrafts factory near the community of tyner every year in 
late october they man an assembly line until middecember making 
thousands of natural pine and fir wreaths for shipment across the 
country 
it gives them an opportunity to buy things at christmas for 
their children and grandchildren that they might not otherwise 
have says carol parrett quality control chief at the factory 
operated by the nonprofit christian appalachian project cap 
unemployment in the southeastern kentucky county has hovered 
well above the 10 percent mark for most of 1988 peaking at 185 
percent in february 
ms parrett says most workers in the wreath factory are women 
many of whose husbands and sons must travel 40 to 80 miles out of 
the mountains to find work in larger towns 
bernie hale marketing director for the factory says christmas 
ridge handcrafts plans this year to produce about 65000 wreaths 
that sell at between 13 and 30 the factory in three old school 
buildings shipped about 51000 wreaths in 1987 he says 
the income from the wreath business is put back in to help 
create more jobs for the area says hale 
he said about 1 million the factory is projected to earn this 
year would go to support other cap craft businesses 
ms parrett says the wreath factory began more than 20 years 
ago when about 10 women put together the decorations in an 
unheated tobacco barn a local farmer allowed them to use output 
and employment has grown steadily each year since then 
production of the wreaths begins with bending wire about the 
same gauge as used in thick clothes hangers into 10inch hoops 
after wire clasps are spotwelded onto the hoops workers attach 
ample helpings of fir or pine and the thick green wreaths begin to 
take shape 
the unfinished wreaths then are placed on tobacco sticks in a 
storeroom until another crew places bows pine cones and artificial 
cranberries on them and slides the completed products into shipping 
boxes the finished wreaths measure 22 inches across and are 4 
inches thick 
although the factory used kentucky pine for many years hale 
says most of the evergreen material now comes from washington and 
oregon and is stored in 14 refrigerated semitrailers at the 
factory 
hale says the factory accepts written orders for the wreaths 
from anywhere in the united states at the cap office in lancaster 
ky 40446 
christmas ridge wreaths are sold primarily through directmail 
promotions which hale says has yielded declining returns during 
the past few years 
he says the factory also makes wreaths for several mail order 
catalogs and has started selling the products this year as part of 
fundraising projects for other nonprofit groups

while thousands of americans will sit 
down to a feast of turkey stuffing cranberry sauce and other 
assorted fixings this year the first thanksgiving celebrated by 
pilgrims and indians was a more modest affair 
venison and cod lobster and sea bass squash beans and 
artichokes probably comprised at least part of the historic 
peacefeast between the wampanoag indians and the pilgrim settlers 
367 years ago 
in the fall of 1621 the 52 men women and children who survived 
the first year in the new world after leaving england on the 
mayflower decided to hold a celebratory feast fifty others died of 
frostbite pneumonia and starvation just four adult housewives 
survived the first winter 
our harvest being gotten in our governor sent four men on 
fowling that so we might after a special manner rejoice together 
after we had gathered the fruit of our labors edwin winslow a 
pilgrim wrote in a firsthand report of the feast 
the threeday secular celebration was held sometime between 
sept 21 and nov 9 according to historians at plimoth plantation 
a pilgrim village recreation in plymouth 
two primary references from the first thanksgiving remain 
including a diary kept by gov william bradford they show that the 
feast included cod sea bass wildfowl such as geese ducks and 
swans wild turkeys corn meal and five deer brought by the 
indians about 90 of whom attended 
the turkeys though were dry and stringy and the meat was 
probably boiled some of the vegetables were eaten raw but most 
were boiled cranberries plentiful in new england also were 
served 
beer was the liquid of choice even for children since the 
water was considered unreliable among the desserts served were 
pudding and ashcakes cornmeal cakes baked in ashes 
there was no cider because apple and other fruit trees would 
take years to bear fruit after planting no potatoes no corn on 
the cob no molasses no coffee or tea either 
the pilgrims and indians broke a variety of breads at 
clothcovered tables sitting on benches some of the important men 
had chairs there were some knives and forks but no spoons hands 
were the utensils of choice 
the feast was formalized under president george washington who 
set aside thursday nov 26 1790 as the first officials day of 
thanksgiving for the many signal favors of almighty god but it 
wasnt until 1863 that thanksgiving day became an annual holiday 
decreed by president abraham lincoln during the civil war 
these days the town of plymouth stages events to commemorate 
the first thanksgiving including a public dinner at memorial hall 
that normally attracts about 2000 people 
many of the towns attractions including cranberry world 
visitors center the mayflower ii replica and the 1627 pilgrim 
village remain open on the holiday

it was in the year 165 bc that judah macabee and his followers 
defeated three syrian generals and recaptured and rededicated the 
temple at jerusalem 
jews around the world still celebrate the event hanukkah an 
eightday holiday which this year begins the night of dec 3 
hanukkah the festival of lights is one of the few holidays 
that unites israeli jews divided at other times along religious 
and secular lines 
secular jews observe it as a celebration of the victory by the 
small band of jewish rebels over their mighty syrian rulers as a 
symbol for modernday zionism 
 
religious jews emphasize an ancient miracle said to have 
occurred at the temple after it was liberated when an eternal 
flame burned for eight days on oil that should have lasted one day 
 
whatever their level of observance almost all israeli jews at 
some time light the menorah the holy lamp that recalls the story 
of judah and his followers 
 
jewish tradition holds that when the rebels were purifying the 
temple of pagan rituals performed by the syrians they found enough 
oil for only one day to relight an eternal flame but miraculously 
the flame burned eight days until more oil arrived 
while the traditional menorah is described in the bible as 
having seven candlesticks a special candlelabrum with nine 
candlesticks the hanykkiyah is used only to celebrate hanukkah 
 
for the eight days of hanukkah jews celebrate by lighting an 
additional candle each night on the candlelabrum a ninth candle in 
the middle known as the shamash or servant in hebrew is used 
to light the other eight 
in israel menorahs adorn public buildings and flicker in the 
windows of homes at jerusalems western wall commonly known as 
the wailing wall and the last remnant of the rebuilt temple 
destroyed in 70 ad a large oilburning lamp is lighted each 
night by leading rabbis and biblical scholars 
in the united states hanukkah is often marked by giving lavish 
gifts but hanukkah presents are rarely exchanged in israel 
children receive small sums of money known as hanukkah gelt in 
yiddish or the traditional foursided spinning top called a 
dreidel 
many believe that hanukkah giftgiving became popular in the 
united states because of the holidays proximity to christmas

its little wonder that santas beard is white 
the nations retailers are expected to provide some 150000 
items to choose from this holiday season with more than 5000 of 
them new this year 
yet caution seems to be the watchword for both customer and 
retailer says douglas thomson president of the the toy 
manufacturers of america a trade association 
retailers are cautious extremely slow in placing orders this 
year he says and in the kinds of toys they order too 
theyre taking fewer chances customers are more conservative 
too 
industry growth is seen as a little flat as it was in 1986 
and 1987 when sales were the same 125 billion 
thomson sees this year as a continuation of the cooling off 
and consolidation time still quite good but less successful 
than the 19831985 period of exceptional business that he says was 
caused by a sudden consumer interest in cabbage patch dolls the 
trivial pursuit board game and transformer toys 
he sees these trends in toys for this season 
a continuing resurgence of popularity in video games 
especially among young boys led by nintendo products this area 
has had the biggest effect in sales and will continue he says 
last years home video game sales were estimated at more than 1 
billion

when shopping for children this holiday season avoid the fad 
toys suggests an association of early childhood professionals 
fad toys often bore children quickly says susan bredekamp of 
the national association for the education of young children 
naeyc 
there is a reason the same toys are played with generation 
after generation wooden blocks crayons puzzles trucks dolls 
and so forth she says its because they meet the need that 
young children have always had and will always have 
she has some other ideas 
know the age of the child youre buying for especially up to 
age 3 when in doubt about what a child might like she says 
pick something he or she will grow into within six months 
buy toys that involve the child not that only entertain 
price has no bearing on the interest a child will have in a 
toy many favorite activities of children involve inexpensive 
articles packsts of colored construction paper a box of chalk 
plastic stacking cups harmonicas she says

some of the worst toys for children are the expensive gimmicky 
spectator type such as talking dolls and bears because they do 
things as the child watches passively according to jack lochhead 
of the university of massachusetts at amherst 
such toys squelch the childs imagination and limit play 
explains lochhead director of the universitys center for 
cognitive research processes 
the best toys he says are low cost low tech toys that offer 
imaginative play unpainted wooden blocks that help teach 
geometric patterns and mathematical concepts and the educational 
toys often found in schools

parents whove finally gotten used to their kids firing light 
guns at the television or being lost for hours in electronic 
labyrinths may want to brace themselves for this years christmas 
offerings from the video game makers 
among the gadgets being introduced this season are game sets 
that can sub for home computers game cartridges with memories that 
rival business computers and a rug that plays music when you dance 
on it 
the mainstays however are still the fantasies that let 
youngsters believe they can outshoot outfight outdrive and 
outwit the bigger bad guys 
home video games were the hot seller among toys last christmas 
with 1987 total sales reaching about 11 billion says market 
leader nintendo of america but this year nintendo and its 
competitors say total sales should more than double 
just a few years ago video games were considered an outdated 
fad while consumers had paid 3 billion a year for games and game 
cartridges in the early 1980s industry experts say that by 1985 
sales had fallen to about 100 million with manufacturers letting 
35 game cartridges go for 5 or less 
that year however nintendo a subsidiary of nintendo co ltd 
of japan began testmarketing a new game system that had been a 
runaway success with the japanese the nintendo entertainment 
system essentially a small computer control panels and game 
cartridges containing computer chips offered more intricate games 
with higherquality graphics and sound 
folks in this country liked it too and nintendo manufacturer 
of such hit arcade games as donkey kong and mario bros led a 
comeback for the videogame market 
this year nintendo and its two main rivals atari corp and 
tonka products co forecast the total video game market at up to 
23 billion with perhaps 8 million units being sold 
nintendo spokesman robert lindner says the redmond washbased 
company and its licensees anticipate garnering 17 billion of the 
total lindner said nintendo estimates its current market share at 
774 percent with atari at 133 percent and tonkas sega at 41 
percent 
he gets an argument from michael katz president of ataris 
entertainment electronics division in sunnyvale calif katz pegs 
his companys dollar share of the market at 20 percent 
another objection comes from patty lewis vice president of 
marketing and product development for sega in minnetonka minn 
who says sega expects about a 13 percent share 
whatever those numbers might be here are some that might be of 
more interest to shoppers expect to pay anywhere from 50 to 150 
for a game set and from 15 to over 50 for a game cartridge 
depending on features and complexity 
most of nintendos games run about 35 the topselling game has 
been the legend of zelda a fantasy adventure however lindner 
says its about to be overtaken by super mario bros ii the 
latest adventures of mario and his brother luigi who made their 
arcade reputation by battling bowsers and mushroom people 
mike tysons punchout a boxing game plugged by the 
heavyweight champ and two racing games rc proam and 
excitebike also are doing well lindner says 
atari which started this whole business back in the 1970s when 
founder nolan bushnell cooked up a game called pong this year 
is offering three different systems starting with the 2600 which 
retails at about 50 
the 2600 was the machine that led the first video game boom 
from 19761983 katz says it now sells for about 50 a third of 
what it was a decade ago while game cartridges are all under 15 
hundreds of games are available but among the top sellers are 
such old favorites as pole position a racecar game and 
arcade standards centipede and ms pac man 
at the midprice level around 80 is ataris 7800 system 
which can run more complicated games along with those made for the 
2600 game cartridges go for 20 and under with the best seller 
being oneonone basketball promoted by larry bird and julius 
dr j erving 
ataris topoftheline is the xe an ultimate game system but 
also a beginning computer says katz with 64 kilobytes of 
memory a keyboard a joystick and light gun the system can play 
games similar to those offered for home computer and even act as a 
word processor hardball a baseball game is among the top 
sellers as is fight night a boxing game 
sega offers a basic system for 79 that includes the game 
machine two controllers and a builtin game says ms lewis 
adding a light gun and another game brings the price to 99 while 
the deluxe set with 3d glasses brings it to 149 
sega is introducing 12 new games including monopoly 
shinobi a karate game thunderblade a helicopter attack 
game and double dragon a version of an arcade game in which a 
couple of guys rescue a girl 
at the top of its list however is phantasy star a 
roleplaying adventure designed to compete with legend of zelda 
the games range from about 25 to 45 except for phantasy 
star which sells for over 50

in the coming weeks as stores and shopping 
malls fill with people buying christmas gifts it might look like 
any other holiday season 
but the bustle will mask the fact that cautious consumer 
spending has forced retailers to take a subdued approach to this 
christmas and their prospects for meaningful sales growth in the 
foreseeable future 
nonetheless stores are expected to have a profitable season 
last year i played ebenezer scrooge said robert buchanan 
an analyst with the investment firm ag edwards amp sons inc in st 
louis this year im a little more upbeat especially with 
respect to earnings because of the constructive steps the 
retailers have taken in recognition of slower sales 
said michael wellman vice president for marketing at k mart 
corp christmas is going to be very competitive but no reason 
to be gnashing ones teeth over the consumer who doesnt seem to 
have much enthusiasm 
estimates of sales growth this season range from 4 percent to 6 
percent over christmas 1987 levels or about the pace of inflation 
so far this year thats what economist david wyss calls a 
mediocre christmas not a terrible one 
people are a little bit nervous about the economy said 
wyss of data resources inc a lexington massbased economic 
forecasting service 
its been a year since the stock market crash but i dont 
think the crash has entirely left their minds he said 
higher interest rates relatively weak growth in income and a 
low savings rate are also contributing to consumers uneasiness 
wyss said 
christmas is makeitorbreak it time for retailers because they 
earn as much of 60 percent of their annual profits during the 
fourth quarter but even if this season proves to be unexciting 
there is little fear that earnings will suffer 
retailers are generally lean on their inventories heading into 
christmas said buchanan less merchandise on hand means less 
merchandise to be marked down at the end of the season

forty years ago when the late songwriter johnny marks penned 
his first draft of rudolph the rednosed reindeer he was 
unhappy with it so unhappy he thought it was the worst song he 
ever wrote 
in fact marks dissatisfaction was such that he put the song 
aside and didnt get back to it until the following year 
but in 1949 while humming the melody during a walk near his 
home in new yorks greenwich village the composer hit upon a 
solution 
instead of having the notes in the unsatisfactory opening bars 
dropping down the scale he reversed the progression and had them 
go up 
asked how long it took to complete the new version marks 
replied 
it took me only two weeks but 20 years of songwriting to 
learn what to throw away 
since then rudolph has been a spectacular success 
according to one record industry source it has been translated 
into nearly every language and sold approximately 150 million 
records more than 8 million copies of sheet music and 25 million 
copies of 200 arrangements for orchestras bands and choral groups 
gene autry first recorded it and gave the first live performance 
of the song at a rodeo at new yorks madison square garden 
changing the finale of his show from ghost riders in the sky to 
rudolph the rednosed reindeer 
marks who died in 1985 often was called mr christmas of the 
music world among his other holiday compositions were i heard 
the bells on christmas day rockin around the christmas tree 
and a holly jolly christmas 
perhaps the most memorable of christmas songs however is 
white christmas 
sung by bing crosby in the 1942 movie holiday inn it 
became irving berlins greatest hit and resulted in the 1954 movie 
white christmas starring crosby danny kaye rosemary clooney 
and veraellen 
written during world war ii berlin has said it was nostalgic 
for a lot of boys who werent home for christmas its been a lot 
more than that perhaps the second most popular christmas song 
ever to silent night 
in 1973 the international society of santa claus gave its first 
award to marks for rudolph and berlin for white 
christmas in recognition of their contribution to the spirit of 
christmas 
runnersup were charles dickens a christmas carol and 
clement moores twas the night before christmas 
another christmas song silver bells was written by jay 
evans and ray livingston for christmas sequences of a bob hope film 
comedy the lemon drop kid 1951 it became the biggest seller 
for the songwriting team

the film world has long been fascinated with 
the yuletide season 
charles dickens a christmas carol the timeworn tale of 
scrooge and tiny tim may well be the most recurrent of the 
christmas movies it appeared in several versions during the silent 
era then mgm made a 1938 a christmas carol with reginald owen 
as scrooge in 1951 the english did their own version with 
alistair sims as the legendary pennypincher the british had done 
an undistinguished scrooge in 1935 
albert finney was unrecognizable in the title role of the 1970 
scrooge and a recent version starring george c scott has 
become a television perennial a couple of years ago the walt 
disney company enlisted all of its cartoon stars for a featurette 
mickeys christmas carol 
the song white christmas sung by bing crosby in the 1942 
film holiday inn became irving berlins greatest hit and 
resulted in the 1954 movie white christmas 
frank capras unabashed sentiment often resulted in christmas 
scenes notably in meet john doe and its a wonderful life 
the latter shows up regularly on holiday television 
oddly most films with christmas in the title have fared 
poorly at the box office 
the christmas tree starring william holden and virna lisi 
was a 1969 bomb 
in 1944 universal cast its biggest star deanna durbin in a 
grim melodrama with gene kelly christmas holiday audiences 
voted overwhelmingly for deanna to return to musicals 
other misfires christmas eve three wayward sons george 
raft randolph scott george brent return to their mother ann 
harding for the holiday 1944 christmas in july a tame 
satire of the advertising industry by preston sturges 1940 
christmas in july a soap opera with barbara stanwyck and 
dennis morgan 1945 
disney had little luck with one magic christmas a 
capraesque fantasy starring mary steenburgen and harry dean 
stanton 
the producers of superman thought they would have another 
boxoffice bonanza with a bigbudget santa claus the movie 
starring david huddleston in the title role and dudley moore as 
chief elf they thought wrong the film was the turkey of 1985 
the most successful film about christmas has been george 
seatons miracle on 34th street starring edmund gwenn as a 
department store santa claus who claims to be the real thing the 
film which also starred maureen ohara john payne and a young 
natalie wood has become a television perennial and has now been 
colorized much to the distress of purists 
some other films featuring christmas the holly and the ivy 
1952 the inn of the sixth happiness 1958 the bells of 
st marys 1945 the man who came to dinner 1941 young 
at heart 1954 the apartment 1960 the glenn miller 
story 1954 not to mention santa claus conquers the 
martians 1980

that winter wish list for wellstocked wallets 
the neiman marcus christmas catalog this year reflects that not 
everything is better in pairs providing a lift for yuletide 
spirits with a hisorhers hotair balloon 
but for conspicuous holiday consumers the company that 
introduced hisandhers camels dirigibles and spangled cats is not 
saying that togetherness is out of vogue with the affluent 
featured in the catalog is the neiman marcus cloudhopper a 
30foottall hotair balloon that fits into an automobile trunk and 
onto the back of its rider 
we only have one balloon the cloudhopper says company 
spokeswoman pat zajac only one can ride in it of course if 20 
people want one thats no problem we are prepared to provide as 
many cloudhoppers as the world wants 
constructed by per lindstrand of thunder and colt balloons 
england the fantasy of freeflight sells for a mere 18000 
we always look for things that are unexpected unusual says 
ms zajac and this is the worlds first backpack balloon 
its the most compact balloon ever offered to the public 
she says its a backpack balloon that fits in the trunk of a car 
as a whole unit 
not all the catalog gifts are for loners but like an upscale 
easy rider a customer can take to the road riding a limited 
edition harleydavidson heritage softail motorcycle with customized 
seat and sporting a matching helmet and hisorhers black leather 
jacket with silver studs 
malcolm forbes would love it says ms zajac referring to 
the publishing magnate who owns a collection of motorcycles you 
are seeing more ceos and business people out on the road with their 
motorcycles 
liz taylor loves the color purple malcolm has supplied her 
with her own violet motorcycle 
the wanderlust may strike christmas shoppers in a more 
downtoearth way 
for 25000 you can take a 10day bicycle tour of italys 
tuscany region on custom cinelli touring bikes which may be 
personalized with your monogram or family crest 
the romantic tour for two the tuscany gran turismo comes 
with a deluxe motor coach and a driverguide to accompany the 
riders who can room at luxurious country inns and villas through 
the trip 
this year the gift selection contains a touch of humor theres 
a silverplated baby bottle for a budding corporate chief executive 
officer at 25 
we have taken the baby from silver spoon in mouth to bottle 
says ms zajac 
other novelties include an edible chocolate chess set giant 
milk and whitechocolate postage stamp replicas brooches of metal 
and precious stones depicting official birds of the 50 states and a 
set of howling coyote salt and pepper shakers handmade in 
albuquerque by a native artist 
ms zajac says 32 million neiman marcus catalogs were mailed to 
shoppers worldwide 
through the years we have tried to appeal to the humor and 
the child in all of us she says we try to approach the 
merchandising of the christmas book with humor and whimsy if 
nothing else it is a wish book for those who read it

the holiday season can bring out the worst 
in christmas shoppers when it comes to irrational buying according 
to a miami university marketing expert 
when we feel depressed by the season its not uncommon for us 
to go out and buy items we dont want or need just to pick up our 
spirits says jack gifford chairman of the universitys 
marketing department 
another holiday buying trend he says indicates shoppers also 
find it much easier to spend lots of money on several smaller items 
and avoid the one major ticket item 
for many busy families according to another miami university 
professor stress is intensified during the yuletide season 
christmas is particularly stressful for twoincome families 
attempting to balance the demands of jobs with personal 
expectations of family togetherness and holiday activities says 
timothy brubaker director of the universitys family and child 
studies center 
addressing christmas cards can be a major chore much less 
baking and decorating cookies or entertaining and the interruption 
in routines caused by school holidays adds to the tension he 
says 
brubaker who edits family relations a journal of applied 
family and child studies published by the national council on 
family relations also believes holiday media images dont help 
with their portrayal of traditional families and career couples 
who are always at home 
reality is much different he says noting that according to the 
1987 census both mothers and fathers are employed in 57 percent of 
twoparent families with children 6 or under 
and then there is the matter of new years resolutions 
many people find their will power to follow through on the 
resolutions begins to falter by early february because of a complex 
mind game called selfhandicapping says richard sherman 
professor of social psychology at the university 
selfhandicapping gives people an excuse so that if a 
situation fails its not their fault sherman explains 
for example debbie could get a date if she lost weight 
however if she loses the weight and still cant get a date she no 
longer has a ready reason having an excuse for failure is much 
less threatening than thinking we are not capable of succeeding

the holidays are here the holidays are there 
the holidays are in fact nearly everywhere 
america must love its holidays at least judging by the files of 
the federal government since the nation has no fewer than 110 
places called holiday 
from holiday hills ark to holiday acres del and from 
holiday shores mo to holiday resort tenn these festive 
appellations sprinkle the land 
and thats not all a look at the us geological surveys 
geographic names information system shows 89 christmases across the 
country along with seven places called santa claus three yules 
all in colorado and even one poinsettia poinsettia park in polk 
county fla 
the usgs names information system which has collected more 
than 2 million names of places and geographic features for use in 
federal mapping and data programs shows texas is tops in christmas 
country with 10 places using that name while there are three 
christmases in florida and seven each in arizona and california 
theres christmas knob in oneida county ny and christmas 
cove in maine christmas camp lake in louisiana and christmas 
landing in alabama 
presiding over christmas are the seven santa clauses including 
the community of santa claus in toombs county ga 
others include santa claus churches in alaska and indiana 
locations called santa claus in arizona indiana and minnesota 
santa claus spring in nevada and santa claus rock in utah 
for the decorative there are 542 spots nationwide called holly 
more than enough to decorate the lone wreath wreath hill in 
campbell county wyo 
folks more inclined to snuggle up and kiss on the holidays can 
find ample comfort in a dozen mistletoes 
mistletoe mine in nevada might be a good spot since its no 
longer active or perhaps mistletoe state park in columbia county 
ga 
they could walk mistletoe trail in maryland study their skills 
at mistletoe school in shasta county calif drift across 
mistletoe lake minn and perhaps even end their days at mistletoe 
cemetery in goliad county texas 
if festive song is desired some 30 noels mark this land from 
noel bay sc to noel creek mont noel colo and even noel 
ditch in seneca county ohio 
looking for a white christmas perhaps it can be found at the 
nations 563 snow place names 
theres snow hill conn where a white christmas is likely and 
snow brake in tallahatchie county miss where the chance is 
smaller others include snow lake neb snow pond nh snow 
school in north dakota and snow cemetery in windham county vt 
and just to round up the seasonal decorations with a traditional 
christmas tree the nations place names include 5073 spots with 
pine in their names as well as 98 spruces 735 balsams 
and 130 places named fir 
tinsel appears only twice for lakes in michigan and 
wisconsin but for other decorations there are 129 garland

is firing people during the holidays cruel or kind and could 
this actually be an opportune time to be out of work 
according to stephen strasser associate professor of management 
and human resources at ohio state university there is no good time 
to get laid off from work 
but a holiday firing can present natural opportunities to 
network says strasser author of working it out sanity and 
success in the workplace 
people are usually very supportive and sympathetic he says 
because we all easily identify with the individual who has been 
fired 
strasser adds that holidays can be a good time for job hunting 
because many companies review their budgets and staff changes 
often are made at the first of the year

the dollar plunged against the japanese yen today 
despite intervention by the bank of japan while share prices rose 
slightly on the tokyo stock exchange 
the dollar closed at 12500 yen down 108 yen from fridays 
finish at 12608 yen opening at 12572 yen the currency fell and 
ranged from 1249812585 yen 
the central bank intervened a few times but it didnt work

a bank of japan official refused to say if it had intervened to 
try to keep the dollar from falling 
we know nothing about it we dont give out any information 
about our activities he said speaking on condition of anonymity 
exchange dealers said the dollar opened low mainly due to a 
decline in the currency on overseas markets they said investors 
generally felt the us economy was slowing down and that was 
driving the dollar down 
kawai said the dollarselling mood was still strong in the 
market

the nikkei topped the 28000 level at midmorning today for the 
first time since sept 19 when emperor hirohito fell seriously ill

prices over the last five trading days gradually pressed the nikkei 
back below the 28000point level toward the end of the trading

chinese officials are taking pains to assure 
foreign businesses that their contracts will be honored despite 
plans to slash domestic spending and shut down hundreds of domestic 
companies 
chinas handling of its latest austerity drive the third since 
it opened to foreign trade and investment in 1978 shows a new 
awareness of the need to temper the effect of policy swings and 
avoid frightening away foreign investors considered key to 
development 
premier li peng vice premier tian jiyun trade minister zheng 
tuobin and the bank of china all have promised in recent weeks that 
chinas 9700 foreign joint ventures will be exempt from austerity 
measures intended to stem a 20percent inflation 
all signed contracts for ordering goods and joint ventures 
will be implemented li told about 200 visiting chief executive 
officers of american companies on oct 17 he repeated the same 
message later in the week to a japanese banking delegation 
the bank of china the chief chinese lender to joint ventures 
said it will continue doing so 
one of chinas leading investment and trade companies the kang 
hua development corp which has been stripped of trade rights and 
ordered to divest many subsidiaries as punishment for illegal 
operations promised it will carry out all contracts already signed 
with foreign companies 
kang hua has signed about 4000 import and export contracts 
worth a total of 670 million since being founded 17 months ago 
the assurances seem to be having their desired effect foreign 
businessmen and diplomats in beijing said they expect a drop in 
chinese import orders but not a significant reduction in joint 
venture activity most seemed confident the impact would be minimal 
one predicted delays in signing new contracts however as the 
central government scrutinizes local projects more closely to weed 
out any not deemed essential 
chinese officials say consumption and industrial growth must be 
slowed and beijing must reassert central control over the economy 
to restore order to a market in which excessive demand has 
generated inflation hoarding and black marketeering 
foreign companies that sell factory equipment raw materials and 
luxuries to china from cars to air conditioners can expect a drop 
in orders import taxes on a wide range of goods have been 
increased and calls have been issued for import substitution where 
possible 
however premier li told the chief executive officers that china 
remains interested in joint projects in energy transportation 
communications raw material production and hightechnology 
foreign companies that want to manufacture consumer appliances 
in china such as televisions and refrigerators are welcome only 
if their products are for export li said 
the government also has said the construction of hotels 
auditoriums and other public buildings will be sharply curtailed 
companies found guilty of illegal transactions such as buying and 
selling scarce goods on the black market will be closed and 
companies set up by government offices will be shut down or spun 
off 
specifics such as which projects will be halted and which 
chinese companies reorganized or closed have been slow to emerge 
and foreign businessmen said it was too early to predict the 
eventual impact there have been no reports of casualties in the 
form of canceled contract talks 
the government also ordered slowdowns in economic growth in 1980 
and 1985 when it ran short of foreign currency reserves needed for 
imports some joint ventures were halted in midstream or canceled 
as were many import orders 
at that time the chinese had no cash said a western 
diplomat now its different they have the cash theyre trying 
to pause and think

grain and soybean futures prices opened mostly 
higher today on the chicago board of trade with the soybean market 
leading the way on a combination of technical buy signals and 
indications of stronger export demand 
analysts said professionals who watch trends on price charts had 
turned bullish on the soybean market following fridays late rally 
which appeared to mark a turnaround in the markets direction 
most of the news last week was bearish for beans and when a 
market stops going down on negative news its always a sign to 
technicians that weve just about sold off enough at least for the 
near term said richard feltes director of commodities research 
with refco inc a chicagobased commodities brokerage 
feltes also said a large foreign grain company was positioned to 
take delivery of a large amount of soybeans which the market saw

the unprecedented midoctober frenzy of buyout 
bids that hit wall street has spawned its biggest deal yet a 131 
billion megabuyout of kraft inc by philip morris cos inc that 
would create the worlds biggest consumer products company 
the proposed combination announced sunday if successful the 
biggest ever between two nonoil us companies would end a short 
but intense takeover battle between the two giant food and consumer 
goods companies 
it also would create a 40 billionayear company armed with 
some of the nations bestknown consumer products including philip 
morris miller beer marlboro cigarettes jello and maxwell house 
coffee and krafts velveeta processed cheese parkay margarine 
philadelphia cream cheese miracle whip salad dressing and sealtest 
ice cream 
that would fulfill philip morris goal of reducing its 
dependence on revenue from its slowing cigarette business while 
making it a tougher worldwide competitor against other giant 
multinationals 
as we have stated from the outset we believe the combination 
of philip morris and kraft will create a usbased food company 
that will compete more effectively in world food markets stated 
hamish maxwell chairman and chief executive of philip morris 
krafts products provide an excellent complement to our 
existing product lines and position us to capitalize on marketing 
opportunities worldwide maxwell said 
in a joint announcement the companies said they had a 
definitive agreement for philip morris to boost its outstanding 
tender offer for all of krafts outstanding stock to 106 a share 
from 90 
kraft shares closed at 9650 up 2 a share friday on the new 
york stock exchange philip morris closed down 25 cents at 9475 a 
share 
in midday trading today philip morris was up 175 a share at 
9650 while kraft rose 7 a share to 10350 
kraft had rejected as inadequate the 90 a share offer made on 
oct 17 and unveiled a defensive restructuring it said would pay 
its stockholders 110 a share in cash and securities 
the restructuring thought by many analysts to be mainly a 
bargaining ploy also would have boosted the companys debt load 
by about 124 billion likely forcing kraft to sell some of its 
businesses in order to raise cash for making debt payments 
last tuesday kraft said it would negotiate only if philip 
morris sweetened its offer to 110 a share or more and sharply 
stated it would not be pressured into a buyout 
after negotiations last friday in chicago company officials 
hammered out a preliminary agreement that the kraft board of 
directors approved at a sunday meeting in new york maxwell said in 
a telephone interview 
our shareholders are receiving full value and this merger is 
the best possible outcome for our employees customers and the 
communities in which we operate john m richman kraft chairman 
and chief executive stated sunday 
if completed the merger would rank in size behind only the 
134 billion acquisition of gulf oil corp by what is now chevron 
corp in 1984 
with combined revenue of about 395 billion in the year ended 
june 30 the company would rank as the worlds biggest consumer 
products maker outpacing the 30 billionayear britishdutch 
company unilever nv according to industry estimates 
the combination of kraft and general foods corp which philip 
morris acquired for 56 billion in 1985 would produce about 20 
billion in annual revenue making philip morris the worlds 
secondbiggest food company after switzerlands 28 billion nestle 
sa 
the proposed buyout comes on the heels of a stunning midoctober 
wave of multibilliondollar takeover bids focusing on food 
companies which heightened the importance of being able to compete 
with the international behemoths 
still pending is a 203 billion buyout proposal by the 
investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co for food and tobacco 
giant rjr nabisco inc also pending are a 523 billion hostile bid 
for pillsbury co by britains grand metropolitan plc a 14 
billion bid for west pointpepperell inc by rival textile maker 
farley inc and a 9412 million bid for holly farms corp by tyson 
foods inc two of the nations biggest poultry processors 
maxwell said his company had no plans to sell any major kraft 
assets and believed the cash flow of the combined companies should 
be sufficient for paying off the massive debt 
he said philip morris already had 12 billion in bank financing 
in place which combined with cash on hand was enough to complete 
the buyout 
maxwell said that despite the enormous costs of paying off the 
huge debt philip morris was expecting good improvement over this 
year in its earnings for 1989 and 1990 
maxwell also echoed the observations of industry analysts who 
have said a combination of the companies would mean greater 
efficiency in areas such as advertising and food distribution 
while krafts international presence could help overseas marketing 
of general foods products 
kraft has been restructuring for several years in an effort to 
shed its nonfood operations 
in 1986 the company formed premark international inc to spin 
off its consumer products operations with the 18 billion sale of 
its duracell batteries unit this summer to a management group led 
by kohlberg kravis kraft returned to its roots as a food and food 
services concern 
philip morris for its part has been attempting to reduce its 
earnings dependence on the profitable but undependable tobacco 
business which accounts for about 78 percent of its earnings 
according to analysts as part of that strategy it acquired 
general foods 
the tender offer expires at midnight nov 15 unless extended 
the deal is subject to a majority of kraft shares being tendered 
and federal antitrust clearance being given 
maxwell has indicated he did not anticipate any antitrust 
problems because the companies products compete in different 
market segments 
richman and up to two other present members of the kraft board 
of directors were expected to join the philip morris board of 
directors richman also was to be nominated as a vice chairman 
responsible for plans and programs aimed at maximizing benefits 
from the joining of kraft and general foods 
kraft last year posted a profit of 489 million or 360 a 
share on revenue of 99 billion 
philip morris had an overall profit of 184 billion or 775 
per share on revenue of 277 billion

the number of working oil and gas rigs declined 
by 10 this week to total 923 industry watcher baker hughes inc 
said monday 
the decline follows an increase of eight the previous week and a 
rise of 11 two weeks ago a year ago the count was 1131 baker 
hughes said 
the count is the widely watched industry index of drilling 
activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for 
oil as of last friday not the number of rigs producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the number of working rigs since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
the lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on may 2 
among major oil producing states california had the sharpest 
drop with seven fewer rigs with wyoming slipping by five kansas 
three and louisiana and oklahoma with one each 
pennsylvania posted the largest gain with five additional rigs 
with texas and new mexico adding three apiece north dakota and 
ohio two each and michigan and colorado one each

if nothing else its a lesson in 
economics 101 university of texas junior chuck falgout invested 
21 in lecture notes and turned a possible f into a b in biology 
a subscription of 48 issues from a notetaking service 
helped the enterprising falgout flesh out his understanding of a 
difficult subject and with the help of the storebought notes he 
could even afford to miss a lecture or two 
in an age when it seems everything can be had for a price 
lecture note sales are booming in college towns around the country 
fueled by rising demand from underachievers and overachievers alike 
we like to consider it a supplement to your own notes but 
there are a lot of students who skip class said criss dolan 
manager of paradigm notes in austin texas which sells the written 
word on everything from anthropology to economics 
paradigm enjoyed so much success in its 14 years that it opened 
stores in arizona and illinois and inspired a former customer to 
open a shop in columbus 
the companies pay graduate students and college seniors with 
good grades to attend classes and take notes for the publications 
there are some professors who say paradigm notetakers dont 
put this in your notes and we honor that said dolan 
that allows a professor to slip in a key point or reveal a test 
question to students who do attend class without actually punishing 
those who skip she said 
kathy gatton 26 said paradigm helped her get through school 
and four years later she opened grade a notes across from ohio 
state university home to 60000 students 
its one of the largest universities and it didnt already 
have a notetaking service said ms gatton who expects to 
triple her business and earn her first profit this university 
quarter 
grade a opened in september of 1987 and earned modest revenues 
of 60000 in its first school year this month the company 
expanded its note offerings and nearly doubled the size of its 
office 
business has been great but we still get students who 
come in and say gosh i didnt know you were here this is 
great said ms gatton who plans to franchise in 10 more big 
campus towns in the next five years 
most of these services sell notes by the class for about 2 or 
by subscription for 1824 per quarter or semester the note 
takers have 2448 hours to turn in their typewritten notes most 
are paid 10 to cover a 50minute class session 
its great money i wish i had the gpa grade point average 
id be a note taker said erik hemp 23 an office employee of 
notes amp quotes which opened in the fall of 1986 near arizona state 
in tempe 
some educators feel the service encourages students to cut 
class on most campuses the notetaking companies are required to 
obtain professor approval before sending someone in but the 
universities generally do not have official policies on the matter 
its not banned by the dean i would encourage instructors 
to ban it and would never allow it in my own classes but it never 
came up for formal discussion said james casey dean of the 
college of communications at the university of illinois in 
champaign with 38000 students 
it did however come up for discussion in the history 
department at university of texas 
it paradigm was thrown out about four years ago said 
brian levack acting chairman of the department we thought it 
discouraged people from coming to class and therefore we expressed 
unanimous departmental disapproval 
the companies main advertising vehicles are wordofmouth and 
leaflets circulated outside of classes 
thats part of the territory and we never leaflet on friday 
kids blow off the classes then said hemp 
note takers earn most of their business in large introductory 
lecture classes 
problemsolving classes arent suitable for note taking 
said gary magee owner of notes amp quotes in champaign were 
pretty limited in scope 
university of texas biology professor stephen adolph is so fond 
of the idea he turns over his own lecture notes to paradigm 
i havent found a good textbook for my class so it gives them 
something to fall back on he said there are a lot of business 
majors here who arent interested in biology but want to do well 
you can get an a in this class without attending 
he said many professors disapprove of the service because its 
disheartening to look out into a lecture hall that seats 300 and 
see only 50 students 
sometimes its a blow to the ego adolph said

as the election draws near the question becomes 
more significant how much will economic views influence the votes 
of americans 
a cynical axiom of politics suggests that people vote with their 
pocketbooks and that all issues debated in a campaign become 
distilled into that one consideration seconds before the lever is 
pulled 
if that were so it might be good news for incumbents but it 
may not be so this year because of an oddity of politics rather 
than promoting their causes many of the candidates have been doing 
themselves in 
that view comes from outside the political arena from an 
economist who has spent years studying the financial health habits 
and activities of americans 
says economist william c dunkelberg it seems that every 
frontrunner figured out a way to handicap himself helping to 
assure that victory would be more difficult if not impossible to 
achieve where once it may have appeared in the bag 
dunkelberg dean of temple university school of business and 
management observes that if the president had the power to call 
for elections at any time right now would seem to be a good time 
the reason in september 29 percent of all consumers said 
government was doing a good job the highest level in several 
years nearly onehalf felt economic policy was fair and only 
20 percent felt it was doing poorly 
such approval ratings as measured by the university of 
michigan are unheard of after eight years in office dunkelberg 
says 
add to this the finding that 625 percent of the over16 
population is employed and a relatively low and stable inflation 
rate and you have the ingredients of a substantial victory for 
the incumbents 
as if to nail it down consumer optimisim is about as high as it 
has been in the expansion and the percentage of people reporting 
they are financially better off than a year ago is near the 
expansion peak 
but while dunkelberg still feels the economic statistics 
suggest the republicans will be successful he wonders about the 
impact of political behavior on the economic evidence 
the campaign has resembled a competititon between two boys for 
the affection of one girl with each trying to tell things about 
the other that will make the young lady look less favorably on the 
opponent he says 
the young lady however is looking for someone with courage 
says the dean she is looking for a leader who talks positively 
about the future has a plan is willing to take the moral high 
ground and of course can convey all this with a good tv image 
he concludes from this premise that threefourths of the voters 
wish they had a different choice a situation that makes those 
positive economic perceptions a bit less certain than they used to 
be as guides to action

after 65 years the production lines 
at one of henry fords oldest plants will grind to a halt this 
month and the factory that once made radiators for the model t will 
close its doors for good 
for the last 2 years ford employees who didnt accept 
transfers to plymouth mich have dealt with the grim reality that 
their jobs would soon be gone 
i have to relate it to a person who has cancer you have that 
hope that youre going to be cured and finally you realize that 
theres no hope its all gone said james roti roti the 
president of united auto workers local 930 
the radiator and heatercore plant which employed nearly 1500 
in 1973 is scheduled to close nov 30 in this upstate community of 
less than 3000 about 150 miles north of new york city 
ford is switching to aluminum radiators and heater cores instead 
of using copper and brass they will be made in michigan 
the historic plant located on a hudson river site handpicked 
by henry ford during a 1916 camping trip will be gutted and sold 
for between 5 million and 6 million said john c hazlett fords 
plant area manager 
a stone displayed at the plant with the initials of ford and his 
camping companions thomas edison john burroughs and harvey 
firestone sr may be donated to a museum hazlett said 
when ford built the green island plant one of nine hydropower 
plants he erected by 1925 the automaker believed that building 
factories in rural areas would allow farmers to work during winter 
months at his plants 
manufacturing instead of being concentrated in a few centers 
should be and can be widely distributed ford wrote 
how the members of local 930 wish fords statement had withstood 
the test of time but company officials determined that to convert 
the green island plant which had revenues totaling more than 679 
million in 1987 into an aluminum radiator facility would not be 
worth the cost 
it would cost 3 million more annually to make the products in 
new york than in michigan hazlett said 
workers say perhaps the one blessing of their dismal situation 
was that they had plenty of advance warning about the shutdown the 
time helped some plan for the future and gave others a chance to 
work overtime and save money 
it also gave them more time to hold false hopes that things 
would turn around 
first union members fought to keep the plant open even going 
so far as to leaflet shareholders at a detroit meeting in 1986 
they hoped for a new ford product a new owner an 
employeeowned factory and then set their minds on protecting as 
best they could those who would inevitably be jobless 
by october radiator assembly line equipment had been torn out 
of the 287000squarefoot plant much already carted away 
employees still working on heater core lines not far from the 
windows that look out on the hudson river spoke wistfully as they 
looked at the empty spaces where their friends once worked 
how can you feel you know you cant really feel anything 
you just wait for it the shutdown to happen said dennis 
bourdeau 46 a 22year plant veteran who doesnt know what hell 
be doing for a living as of dec 1 
everybody was hoping until the last minute said bourdeau 
productivity never dropped even after layoffs and the shutdown 
were announced there was no sabotage 
most of the workers who average in age at 50 have about 20 
years of service and earn between 14 and 17 an hour just wanted 
to make it to retirement said ray vaillancourt 45 whos worked 
there 23 years 
vaillancourt opted not to take the transfer offer to michigan 
and planned to make his parttime job as a charter bus driver full 
time 
workers arent bitter vaillancourt said 
the mood in the plant said bourdeau is mostly just 
disappointment 
we have met our schedules and our quality has actually 
improved year over year for the last four or five years conceded 
hazlett the plant area manager 
when the shutdown was announced in 1985 the 425 workers werent 
covered by jobsecurity provisions and compromises had to be sought 
transfers were offered to almost every employee and 160 took 
the jobs in plymouth hazlett said jobtraining programs were 
offered and an early retirement plan which begins at age 50 even 
if a worker gets laid off at a younger age was also offered 
ford and the uaw had also worked out education and training 
programs ranging from high school equivalency schooling to truck 
driving 
the training programs took four to five years to get into place 
hazlett said 
you just cant do it in 60 days said hazlett in a 
reference to new federal legislation requiring 60 days notice of 
an impending layoff or shutdown 
don sherman a spokesman for fords climate control division in 
michigan said the company has had a longstanding policy that 
approximately two years advance notice is given before a plant 
closes so the law does not affect the way ford handles such 
situations 
lets face it we dont want to see the plant close union 
leader roti roti said but if there has to be a plant closing 
this is the way to do it

tacoma officials today approved a proposed 
221 million settlement in the washington public power supply 
system securities fraud case and gov booth gardner recommended 
that the state pay 10 million toward the settlement 
the settlement subject to approval by 13 other utilities was 
proposed by bondholders lawyers to resolve a case inspired by the 
largest municipal bond default in history 
the only utility that would remain as a defendant would be 
snohomish county public utility district which contracted for the 
biggest share 13 percent on two wppss nuclear power plants 
the trial was recessed last week in tucson ariz when 
attorneys reported a settlement was possible it is scheduled to 
resume wednesday 
construction was halted on two wppss nuclear plants in 1982 and 
wppss later defaulted on the 225 billion in bonds sold to finance 
construction of the plants precipitating a flood of lawsuits 
a class of more than 24000 past and present bondholders and 
chemical bank of new york a trustee for bondholders claim the 
defendants conspired to lie and hide information that might have 
discouraged potential investors 
in a resolution from the tacoma city council and the city 
utilities board tacoma agreed to pay 402 million as its share of 
the settlement 
ted coates tacoma city lights director of utilities said the 
agreement was also contingent on federal approval of a 35 million 
payment from the bonneville power administration 
bonneville which backed financing of wppsss three other 
nuclear power plants markets power from federal dams in the 
northwest and is the regions largest power broker with an annual 
budget of 3 billion 
in olympia gardner and attorney general ken eikenberry today 
recommended that the state contribute 10 million in a lawsuit 
settlement 
we believe that this will finally put the wppss issue behind 
us gardner and eikenberry said in a letter to state legislators 
washington state is not a defendant in the case on trial but a 
settlement should end a separate lawsuit against the state 
involving the same plaintiffs who are suing to recover 75 
billion the 23 billion default plus interest 
the proposed state involvement in the case would require 
approval of the legislature gardner and eikenberry said they would 
ask for an appropriation in the supplemental budget when the 
lawmakers convene next january 
the 13 other public utility districts involved in the settlement 
proposed by the bondholders were expected to vote soon on the 
proposal 
besides the utilities remaining defendants include two 
engineering firms and a financial consulting firm there has been 
no talk of settlement involving the professional firms and 
attorneys with two of the firms said last week that no talks were 
going on involving their clients

the us supreme court upheld on monday an 
appeals court decision reviving a suit by stockholders who claim 
middle south utilities inc hid its shaky financial condition to 
inflate the value of its stock 
the high court refused without comment to hear an appeal of a 
decision by the 5th us circuit court of appeals that a federal 
district judge dismissed the lawsuit without sufficient explanation 
the 5th circuits ruling in june said that if us district 
judge adrian duplantier again dismisses the suit he must explain 
why in detail so that appeal courts have something on which to base 
their review 
spokesman cyril guerrera said middle south did not have any 
immediate comment on the supreme courts action 
middle south based in new orleans is an electric utility 
holding company that owns louisiana power amp light co new orleans 
power amp light co mississippi power amp light co and arkansas power 
amp light co a fifth subsidiary systems energy resources inc runs 
grand gulf a nuclear power plant in mississippi which sells power 
to all four utilities 
the company has been beset by money troubles for years because 
of grand gulf though it announced last month that it would pay its 
first quarterly dividend since july 1985 
rita isquith and other stockholders filed suit in august 1985 
middle south announced the following month that it was near 
bankruptcy and that for the first time in its 36year history 
it would not be paying dividends on common stock 
the lawsuits claimed that middle south deliberately withheld 
information from investors about its deteriorating financial 
condition the stockholders said they were suing on behalf of 
anyone who bought stock between dec 7 1982 and aug 16 1985 a 
period of heavy trading 
the companys troubles center on its 6 billion investment in 
nuclear power in addition to grand gulf near port gibson miss 
lpampl owns waterford 3 near taft la about 20 miles up the 
mississippi river from new orleans 
there were huge cost overruns and repeated construction delays 
in building both plants middle south has said it does not expect 
to complete a second grand gulf plant 
middle south has obtained rate increases for the two working 
plants but stockholders have had to absorb some of the plants 
costs as part of the deals cut with regulators

the dollar ended mostly higher monday in foreign 
exchange trading in europe as reported intervention by the us 
federal reserve and the bank of japan lifted the dollar above its 
lows 
gold prices also rose 
dealers said the dollar fell on low volume in tokyo despite 
reports that the bank of japan intervened to push the dollar higher 
reports that the fed bought dollars for yen twice during the 
european day pushed the dollar to its session highs before it 
drifted back 
dealers said the intervention succeeded in supporting the dollar 
for the day but they said bearish sentiment toward the dollar is 
widespread 
several dealers said they felt the fed intervened on behalf of 
the japanese central bank and felt the intervention was not meant 
to turn market sentiment around 
the intervention may be enough to steady the market for the 
week said steve barrow corporate advisor at chemical bank 
but it wasnt enough to turn around market sentiment 
bearish sentiment stems from disappointment that the us trade 
deficit has not shown enough signs of improvement while slower 
us economic growth has disappointed those looking for higher us 
interest rates dealers said 
dealers said the dollars movement monday was accentuated by a 
thin market since many corporate players have moved to the 
sidelines before the us presdential elections next week while 
markets in france the philippines taiwan and ireland were closed 
monday for a holiday 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day 
begins the dollar fell 108 japanese yen to a closing 12500 yen

new construction contracting fell 3 percent in 
september pulled down by a decline in commerical and industrial 
projects a business research concern reported monday 
it was the third consecutive monthly decline in total new 
construction starts now valued at 238 billion on an annualized 
basis according to the fw dodge group of mcgrawhill information 
services co 
all of the latest months decline was concentrated in commercial 
and industrial projects the report said 
george a christie a mcgrawhill economist said continuing 
vacancies in commercial buildings and an overall reduction in 
public spending had reversed a fiveyear expansion of building 
activity christie predicted the downward trend in new contracting 
would continue 
newly started construction is on its way to a 3 percent 
decline in 1988 with the prospect of a further dip next year he 
said 
christie said a seasonally adjusted 7 percent dip in 
nonresidential building in september seemed inconsistent with 
1988s surge of manufacturing 
market fundamentals indicate industrial plant construction 
should be up sharply given a capacity utilization of 84 percent in 
the nations factories he said 
instead contracting so far in 1988 is running 10 percent 
behind last year he said 
residential construction meanwhile remained at an annual rate 
of 1157 billion in september unchanged from the previous month 
due in part to relatively stable mortgage interest rates 
the value of contracts for nonbuilding construction such as 
public works and utilities increased 1 percent to an annualized 
rate of 401 billion last month the report said an increase in 
highway and other public works construction was partially offset by 
a decline in utility projects 
for the first nine months new construction starts on an 
unadjusted basis totaled 1917 billion down 3 percent from the 
same period in 1987 
the south has remained the weakest building sector in 1988 with 
6 percent fewer construction starts than in 1987 the northeastern 
and northcentral areas of the united states also showed declines 
of 1 percent and 2 percent respectivetly building in the nations 
western region remained unchanged

boeing attributed the improved earnings to higher sales volume 
lower levels of research development and other newbusiness 
expenses lower federal incometax rates and increased income from

knee with an actualsize box in hand 
such was the chicago bulls stars inauguration as only the 
seventh celebrity athlete to be pictured on the front of 
packages of wheaties the general mills inc cereal marketed as 
the breakfast of champions 
jim nuckols product manager told reporters jordan was a man 
of real character and integrity fitting for the positive image 
the product tries to have 
im very happy to be part of the wheaties organization said 
jordan clad in his no 23 bulls jersey and black sweat pants a 
lot of people would love to be in my shoes 
many might also want to have his bank account which could swell 
with the wheaties deal but jordan and company officials said that 
terms were not being disclosed 
what they did disclose was that jordans picture would be 
printed on at least 12 million to 14 million boxes of the cereal 
others who have contracted with minneapolisbased general mills 
for the wheaties limelight beginning in 1956 include pole vaulter 
bob richards decathlon star bruce jenner gymnast mary lou retton 
baseball player pete rose footballs walter payton and tennis star

child he didnt know about the cereal 
we had a big family said the north carolina native and 
pennies had to be watched we used to eat wheat puffs remember 
those in the big bags that could last through five or six kids 
thats what we had 
on the back of a series of wheaties boxes will be installments 
of the michael jordan story tracing his roots from an awkward 
kid to pro basketballs most valuable player last season 
actually a dozen or two athletes have been pictured on the 
front of wheaties boxes over the years but jordan is only one of 
seven celebrity athletes to get the honor through major deals 
with the company said kathryn newman public relations supervisor

although most basic interstate telephone rates 
have remained unchanged since spring extra charges for directory 
assistance and other adjustments have raised overall longdistance 
calling costs according to a new survey of phone rates 
the consumer survey by the telecommunications research and 
action center a nonprofit group that tracks longdistance rates 
for residential and business callers found some carriers have 
reduced the number of free information calls and cut the hours of 
the cheapest calling period 
rates havent been going down and there have been all sorts of 
adjustments that have been nibbling at the edges to maximize 
revenue from each subscriber said samuel simon a consultant to 
the center 
this is a pattern we expect to see in the future he added 
interstate longdistance rates are due for another round of 
reductions soon to reflect savings from a 60centspermonth 
increase in the line charge subscribers pay to help maintain the 
local phone network the charge will be added to the existing 260 
monthly line charge on dec 1 
american telephone amp telegraph co has proposed to the federal 
communications commission that its rates drop by an average 38 
percent to reflect the linecharge increase atampt competitors do 
not have to cut their rates but they often do to remain 
competitive with the industry leader 
tracs survey found increases ranging from 1 percent to 5 
percent for most longdistance carriers since its last survey on 
march 31 
among the increases reflected in the groups ratecomparison 
chart were a reduction by atampt and mci in the number of free 
longdistance information calls from two to one and mcis increase 
in the cost of such calls from 55 cents to 58 cents trac said 
also allnet has begun applying evening rates rather than the 
cheaper nightweekend rates to its saturday night 5 pm11 pm 
calling period and the company is applying a 5 percent surcharge 
on callers using its equal access service if they dont have an 
account with allnet trac said 
in addition western union raised its rates by about 5 percent 
since the last survey trac said 
trac advises residential and business subscribers to reevaluate 
their longdistance service periodically to see whether there are 
lowercost alternatives 
the problem is that consumers made their decision once and 
have settled into one company and plan said david wagenhauser a 
trac lawyer who managed the survey 
the trac survey compares the cost of longdistance monthly bills 
with 33 123 and 303 interstate calls of a variety of distances 
the cost of three longdistance directory assistance calls was also 
figured into the bills 
for the 33calls comparison the cheapest plan was us sprint 
standard rates at 3360 us sprint 10333 and 10777 access rates at 
3420 mci standard rates and 10222 access at 3488 atampts reach 
out america day option at 3509 and atampts reach out america 
evening option at 3527 
itt standard rates were next at 3537 followed by atampts reach 
out america basic plan 3545 allnet standard rates 3578 atampt 
standard rates and midamerican standard rates 3597 itt 10488 
access longer distance 3604 and allnet 10444 access 3751 
when a typical residential bill of 380 minutes was 
calculated with the bulk of the calls figured at nightweekend 
rates the cheapest plan was midamerican standard rates followed 
by reach out america evening option sprint standard rates reach 
out america day option and sprint 10333 and 10777 access

thirteen northwest lawmakers urged president 
reagan on monday to maintain tariffs on cedar shakes and shingles 
imported from canada imposed almost 30 months ago 
the lawmakers in a letter to reagan said that dropping the 
duty rather than proceeding with plans to gradually phase it out 
would result in shake and shingle prices plummeting as canadian 
imports pour in 
we are confident that if relief for the domestic industry is 
continued for the full fiveyear period as you announced in may 
1986 the industry will be able to meet canadian competition head 
on without additional government assistance 
in announcing the tariffs reagan has said they were necessary 
to allow the industry mostly based in washington state and oregon 
to adjust to competition by modernizing mills and developing 
alternatives to traditional cedar shakes and shingles 
the administration imposed a fiveyear program that called for a 
35 percent tariff during the first 30 months a 20 percent tariff 
between 30 months and 54 months and an 8 percent tariff for the 
final six months 
reagan said it was his intention to maintain the tariffs for 
the entire period if general market conditions continue to 
warrant relief and if the domestic producers have begun to make 
reasonable progress toward adjustment during the first 30month 
period 
but reagan also asked the international trade commission to 
report to him on the probable economic effect on the domestic 
shake and shingle industry if all tariffs were removed after 30 
months 
the commission in early october was unable to reach agreement on 
whether to recommend a continuation of the tariff program as 
planned with three commissioners voting to drop all tariffs 
immediately and three supporting thegradual phaseout originally 
envisioned 
the lawmakers warned that unless the tariffs were maintained as 
planned it will cause extreme hardship on the industry 
many mill owners have purchased or ordered timber in 
anticipation of the continuation of the tariffs and thus have no 
way to reduce their costs to compete against cheaper canadian 
products if the tariffs were dropped the lawmakers said 
since the tariffs were imposed the lawmakers said the canadian 
share of the market has dropped from 73 percent to 59 percent 
employment in the domestic industry is up 26 percent wages up 39 
percent production up 41 percent and mill productivity up 12 
percent 
the letter was signed by democratic reps don bonker al swift 
and mike lowry of washington state les aucoin and peter defazio of 
oregon and richard stallings of idaho 
republican house members signing the letter were john miller of 
washington state denny smith and bob smith of oregon and larry 
craig of idaho 
senators signing the letter were democrat brock adams of 
washington state and republicans james mcclure and steve symms of

the fed does not comment on its currencymarket activities 
which are conducted via a select group of dealers

purchase or sale is so large it can only have been done by a large 
central bank 
currency strategists were divided over the dollars longerterm 
trend many believe the dollar will decline despite central bank 
intervention if pessimism about the us economy intensifies but 
others say the dollar already has declined significantly over the 
past few weeks and is due for a rebound 
james chorek a currency analyst at the commodities futures firm 
mms international in chicago said he believed the dollar would 
continue rising over the next few weeks based on his calculations

said its moving up against everything

the energy department on monday turned over to 
a private buyer the governments only commercial synthetic fuels 
operation a north dakota coal gasification plant spawned by the 
energy crises of the late 1970s 
the price being paid by the buyer basin electric cooperative 
represents 13 cents to 40 cents on every dollar of the governments 
investment depending upon whose analysis is accepted 
the oneofakind plant near beulah nd has been a technical 
success producing an average of 142 million cubic feet a day of 
highbtu synthetic natural gas for four interstate pipelines 
built for 21 billion of which 15 billion was from loans 
guaranteed by the federal government the plant and an associated 
mine passed into government ownership three years ago when its 
private operators defaulted on the loans 
the government is still subsidizing four projects started by the 
defunct synthetic fuels corp 
eight companies submitted bids for the plant basin a 
wholesaler of electricity to rural electric cooperatives won with 
a bid valued by the department at almost 600 million a large part 
of which will be paid from future gas sales this would represent 
40 cents on the dollar of repaid loans 
however the general accounting office said last week that the 
bid should be valued at 200 million still better than continuing 
to run the plant an option gao said would yield a revenue stream 
worth the equivalent of 166 million in a lump sum today 
the chief difference between the two bid values is 300 million 
in production tax credits granted by congress that basin has agreed 
to waive gao said the energy department should not count the 300 
million but the department insists it is a legitimate benefit to 
the government 
at a closing ceremony at the energy department deputy secretary 
joseph salgado said we fundamentally do not believe the 
government belongs in running the project we believe that you as 
businessmen in the community in north dakota have a better sense 
of how to run the business than we do in washington dc thats 
fundamental to the principles ronald reagan has brought to this 
government 
basin electric was selected because among other reasons it 
offered the best chance to keep the plant running salgado said 
robert f mcphail general manager of the cooperative said 
with this signing we feel it is on to bigger and better things 
for the great basin project for basin electric and for the federal 
government 
the sale contract provides that in certain circumstances of 
extremely low gas prices basin electric may return the plant to 
the government 
j allen wampler assistant secretary for fossil energy said he 
did not expect the government ever to have to take over the plant 
again 
i think the worst thing that could possibly happen would be 
the plant would be mothballed by basin until prices rose 
wampler said

the state department of insurance 
charged monday that a subsidiary of the chubb insurance group used 
deceptive and unfair practices to sell socalled drought 
insurance to more than 1000 illinois farmers 
administrative charges filed by the department after a 
fourmonth investigation alleged nine separate violations of state 
law by the subsidiary federal insurance co 
federal sold insurance against inadequate rain a type of 
policy not authorized by state law to farmers who thought they 
were buying coverage for extensive droughtrelated crop losses the 
department said 
even if they had issued policies to every farmer who applied 
for and paid premium for this coverage it could have meant a 
windfall for some farmers and provided no protection at all for 
others even if their comparative crop losses were identical said 
robert enoex chief attorney for the insurance department 
state insurance director john washburn said the charges if 
proved would demonstrate a shocking abuse of and disregard for 
illinois consumers and illinois insurance laws by a member company 
of an insurance group whose reputation at least prior to this 
problem had been considered to be among the best in the industry 
chubb officials had not seen the charges and so could not 
comment on them said gail devlin a senior vice president of the 
group in a telephone interview from new york city 
washburn scheduled a hearing on the charges dec 1 in 
springfield 
if the charges are proved washburn said federal could be 
required to pay 168 million in claims to 702 farmers and also 
might face suspension or revocation of its insurance license 
insurance agents in the midwest advertised the insurance and 
accepted premiums in late spring when many farmers already 
suspected that a dry growing season was in store 
the state charged that federal allowed farmers to assume they 
had received coverage after filing an application and paying a 
premium but then began rejecting the applications nearly halfway 
through the threemonth term of the policies 
federal also arbitrarily changed the amount of insurance it 
planned to make available in each of several different midwest 
regions whenever it seemed to fit their needs said richard 
carlson assistant director of the insurance department 
enoex compared the companys offer of drought insurance last 
summer to offering to sell fire insurance to a person whose 
building is burning and said federals subsequent decision not 
to offer policies was much like tossing gasoline on the fire 
federal has paid nearly 6 million in claims to 246 illinois 
farmers and has made an additional 14 million in goodwill 
payments to 720 farmers who applied for but didnt receive 
coverage the insurance department said 
farmers from all over the country who paid premiums are party to 
a classaction lawsuit in us district court in cincinnati that 
seeks to force chubb to extend coverage to anyone who paid a 
premium and still wants the insurance 
this past weekend minnesota officials said they had reached a 
525 million settlement with chubb and federal over drought 
insurance sold to minnesota farmers last spring 
last month chubb said federal paid out 20 million for drought 
claims in seven midwestern states and another 11 million in 
goodwill payments top farmers who applied but did not receive 
coverage 
chubb said the 8800 applications for 350 million in coverage 
far exceeded the 43 million in coverage it could provide

john morrell amp co on monday sought a 
federal court injunction to block a record 433 million fine 
levied against the meatpacker on friday by the occupational safety 
and health administration 
morrell a subsidiary of cincinnatibased united brands co 
wants to stop the osha action because the company believes it was 
unfairly singled out said morrell chairman milton j schloss 
if osha continues to single out morrell and create a 
completely uneven playing field against our competition osha could 
very well shut that plant down he said 
osha contends the company knew about serious health hazards at 
its sioux falls plant but failed to protect its workers 
the action filed in us district court seeking an injunction 
against osha and the us department of labor contends there are 
no industry standards on how to prevent the repetitive motion 
injuries cited by osha and says morrells repeated requests for 
establishment of such standards have been ignored 
the injuries cited by osha occur as a result of repreated hand 
wrist and arm motion during work 
the fine handed down friday was the largest against a single 
employer in oshas 17year history morrell had 15 days to appeal 
the charges to teh separate federal occupational safety and health 
review commission 
schloss also questioned the timing of the fine which comes just 
weeks before the nov 20 expiration date of the current threeyear 
contract for workers at the sioux falls plant negotiations are 
continuing on a new contract 
the sioux falls plant employs about 2000 workers about 240 of 
them are union members who crossed the picket line during a 
sympathy strike last year another 410 are union members called 
back to work since the strike ended and about 1350 are 
replacement workers hired after the strike began
