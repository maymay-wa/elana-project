northrop corp pleaded guilty tuesday to 
nearly three dozen federal counts related to falsified testing of 
parts for the av8b harrier jet and cruise missile components and 
agreed to a 17 million fine 
in a plea bargain the defense contractor entered guilty pleas 
through attorney richard sauber to 34 counts of making false 
statements to the government 
assistant us attorney william fahey called the resolution of 
the case a very significant victory in our efforts to combat 
defense contractor fraud and mismanagement 
prosecutors said charges would be dropped against joseph yamron 
62 vice president and general manager of northrops norwood 
massbased precision products division and leopold engler 60 
vice president of instrument operations there 
earlier in the day charles gonsalves a former northrop corp 
plant manager pleaded guilty in us district court to charges of 
falsifying test data on components of cruise missile guidance 
systems 
the us government and northrop corp reached a complex 
compromise today under which the government agreed to withdraw 
various charges the company had been contesting for over a year 
and northrop in turn agreed to pay a 17 million dollar fine for 
charges arising out of actions by some employees it subsequently 
fired in 1987 from its now closed western services department 
northrop said in a statement issued from its headquarters 
northrop asserted that according to the military services that 
use the harrier and the cruise missile both systems have 
performed satisfactorily in flight operations 
regarding the western services department and precision products 
division the company said the government dropped 139 counts of 
making false statements and two counts of conspiracy and northrop 
agreed to plead guilty to 34 false statements that had been made by 
the former employees at the department 
gonsalves entered the plea under an agreement with prosecutors 
under which he would be sentenced to no more than three years in 
prison and be fined a maximum of 12 million 
gonsalves once supervisor of the western services department 
pleaded guilty to one conspiracy count and seven counts of making 
false statements to the government from 1984 to 1987 
sentencing was set for may 1 before judge pamela ann rymer 
northrop corp and five current and former employees were 
indicted april 11 1989 on charges of conspiring to defraud the 
government through the cruise missile and the navys av8b harrier 
jump jet program 
gonsalves entered his plea pertaining to the cruise missile 
systems as a jury was about to hear the case against him quality 
assurance supervisor cheryl hannan and northrop on charges related 
to the harrier parts 
prosecutors agreed to a diversion program for hannan who was 
charged in both the harrier and missile aspects of the case and 
charges will be dropped if she completes the program to the 
satisfaction of probation officials 
howard hyde chief engineer at western services pleaded guilty 
last may to charges involving falsifying tests on the jet parts 
the 167count indictment charged that the company and five 
others conspired between the 1970s and 1989 to install parts for 
the cruise missiles flight data transmitter that failed to meet 
government specifications 
it also said the transmitter required extensive reliability 
testing that was not performed instead the indictment said three 
of the defendants supervised false testing and falsification of 
test results 
concerning the harrier jet program the indictment accused the 
defendants of failing between 1981 and 1986 to conduct vibration 
tests of the jets rate sensor assemblies at levels required by 
contract the assemblies are part of the flight stabilization 
system of the attack jet 
yamron and engler who have been on administrative leave to 
prepare their defense will return to their former duties northrop 
said 
from the time last april when the government filed its charges 
against the division mr yamron and mr engler northrop has 
stated the charges were unwarranted and strongly disputed any 
allegations of criminal behaviour by the precision products 
division or by those individuals northrop said

the ethiopian army and rebels are locked 
in battle for a small steamy red sea port that represents a door 
of life for starving millions 
president mengistu haile mariam of ethiopia has called the 
struggle for the port of massawa a fight to the death to 
prevent the collapse of one third of his army and the secession of 
eritrea province 
but the outcome of the battle also may determine the fate of an 
estimated 4 million people in northern ethiopia in peril of 
starving to death in the next few months 
its grim said one western relief worker were looking 
at a catastrophe in the making crops have failed emergency food 
stocks are running low and the fighting has closed avenues for 
relief supplies 
the united nations had hoped to ship most of 11 million tons of 
donor food through massawa to feed drought victims in eritrea and 
neighboring tigre wollo and gondor provinces 
but with each day of fighting between government forces and the 
eritrean peoples liberation front that hope fades 
the eritrean rebels attacked mengistus 2nd army along a 
200mile front on feb 8 in what the rebels described as a massive 
assault 
within two days the rebels claimed the capture of massawa 
without specifically denying the claim the government in addis 
ababa said fighting for the port was continuing the rebels later 
accused the government of subjecting massawa to attacks by heavy 
artillery bombs and napalm 
the rebels contended as recently as last week that they still 
controlled the port but both sides have had little to say about 
the fighting for more than a week 
since each side normally trumpets its victories diplomats and 
other observers in addis ababa take the absence of battlefield 
reports to mean the battle for the port continues 
on feb 17 in an unprecedented burst of candor mengistu said 
his 2nd army faced collapse and eritrea would secede if the rebels 
gained control of massawa 
we have no alternative but to fight to the death mengistu 
told his armed forces in a radio and television broadcast 
he is throwing everything he has into the battle said an 
african diplomat in a telephone interview from addis ababa he is 
reinforcing it eritrea in every way possible said another 
envoy the diplomats spoke on condition they not be identified 
what we dont know is whether the port is going to be usable 
no matter whose hands it winds up in said the western relief 
worker it presumably has been badly damaged 
none of the diplomats or aid officials interviewed by telephone 
from nairobi would speak for attribution saying they must deal 
with mengistus government 
ethiopia has africas largest army an estimated 315000 men 
most of them illtrained and poorly motivated peasant conscripts 
between 120000 and 130000 are assigned to the 2nd army which has 
borne the brunt of a 28yearold secessionist war by the eritrean 
rebels 
the international institute for strategic studies in london puts 
the strength of the eritrean rebels at about 30000 but they are 
known to be well armed mostly with captured weapons and highly 
disciplined 
in the first few days of fighting for massawa and the road that 
connects it with the provincial capital of asmara the rebels claim 
to have killed captured or wounded 12000 government soldiers and 
seized 72 sovietmade tanks 22 artillery pieces and tons of small 
arms they also say they sank 12 ethiopian navy craft in or near 
the port 
as ports go massawa isnt much a cluster of whitewashed stone 
buildings narrow streets and a population of 19400 
but it is one of only two ports on ethiopias red sea coast has 
two deepwater berths and until the rebels began their offensive 
was the main northern gateway to mostly arid and mountainous 
eritrea 
the countrys only other port is at assab also in eritrea near 
its border with djibouti but it has no deepwater berths 
beyond massawa there are few alternative routes for emergency 
food aid 
another rebel group the tigre peoples liberation front cut 
the only highway from the capital north to asmara a year ago some 
food could be trucked in from neighboring sudan but few vehicles 
are available the roads are terrible and at least for now all 
movements must be at night for fear of ethiopian air attacks 
this years harvest failed in large parts of eritrea and tigre 
provinces and to a lesser extent in wollo and gondor what food 
stocks remain from a year ago are rapidly running out 
some 25000 refugees already have fled tigre into sudan and 
united nations and other aid officials expect their number to grow 
as fighting halts food deliveries in northern ethiopia 
those officials foresee a repeat of ethiopias great famine of 
198485 in which as many as 1 million people may have died their 
grim scenario has hundreds of thousands of desperate refugees 
crowding into makeshift camps where weakened by hunger and long 
treks in search of food more die of disease than from meager 
rations 
no end to the fighting is in sight

from israels largest institute of higher learning tel aviv 
university one of several jewish honors given the former president 
so far this year 
the presentation sunday at a starstudded dinner at the century 
plaza hotel cited reagans steadfast friendship for the jewish 
people and vehement rejection of antisemitism 
in recent weeks reagan has been honored by the american jewish 
committee and hebrew university in a few weeks he will be feted 
by the united jewish appeal drive 
reagan joked to the appreciative blacktie audience that his 
receipt of the honorary doctor of philosophy degree cannot be 
based on any academic achievements 
he went on to explain that his alma mater eureka college in 
illinois once gave him an honorary degree 25 years after his 
graduation 
that only aggravated a sense of guilt that i nursed for 25 
years reagan said i always suspected the first degree was 
honorary

its a great time to be president said 
michael dukakis who isnt 
the massachusetts governor visited his wouldbe home for an east 
room reception with president bush on monday and afterward said he 
knows hes missing out on a spate of good news 
i dont stay up nights on the subject dukakis said i 
must say that this would be a great time to be president of the 
united states 
dukakis who has had no such luck with affairs in massachusetts 
over the past year reflected on how events have smiled on his 
political nemesis 
were living through history here this is unprecedented the 
cold war has defined everything about our lives about our country 
about the world and all of a sudden nobody predicted it it seems 
to be sliding away 
the question dukakis said is what bush can make of the 
opportunities that have fallen into his lap 
it seems to me that this is a very good time for the country 
providing we take advantage of what is an extraordinary opportunity 
to provide international leadership if the administration does 
a good job of that then theyre going to be successful and if 
they dont then somebody else is going to be president 
sporting a cast on his left hand because he broke two fingers on 
saturday trying to push a car out of snow dukakis made his second 
trip to the white house since losing to bush in the november 1988 
presidential election he is in town to take part in the annual 
national governors association meeting 
as one with direct experience in the field of changing political 
fortunes dukakis warned bush not to grow overconfident 
especially now that a favorite republican enemy communism 
appears to be waning as a major issue 
the republicans have always had this defense thing and you 
know bush used it against me and in retrospect who was the most 
accurate forecaster it was the democratic nominee dukakis said 
you never know things change in this business 
the successful elections sunday in nicaragua dukakis said are 
an example of the bankruptcy of the reaganbush policy of military 
aid to the nicaraguan contra rebels it was a diplomatic approach 
that opened the door to free elections he said 
whats the record there was no progress toward genuinely 
open free internationally supervised elections until the contra 
effort effectively was killed dukakis said what does that 
tell you 
acting the part of a reporter dukakis quoted bush as saying in 
the closeddoor luncheon with the governors that the defense budget 
may be cut further 
the governors were asking bush whom the country should fear as 
an enemy with the sudden turn of events in eastern europe 
he said the enemy is instability ok fine but then he 
said look weve already cut the defense budget substantially 
below projected levels and he said its probably going to be 
cut even further 
dukakis said he has been too busy digging massachusetts out of a 
fiscal hole lately to think about his postgubernatorial career he 
said he wants to remain involved in public affairs 
as for future runs for political office he said i dont 
think you ever say never to anything who knows

the get tough approach is failing to deter 
criminal activity by young black males 23 percent of whom are 
behind bars or on probation or parole a nonprofit group says 
we now risk the possibility of writing off an entire 
generation of black men from leading productive lives said marc 
mauer assistant director of the sentencing project which promotes 
alternative punishments and sentencing reform 
in a report issued monday the group said 609690 black men age 
20 through 29 nearly one in every four were in prison or jail 
or on probation or parole in mid1989 
in contrast only 436000 black men in the same age group were 
enrolled in college in 1986 the latest year for which figures were 
available 
these are shocking disturbing numbers said rep john 
conyers dmich chairman of the house government operations 
committee 
conyers said he would hold hearings but first wanted the general 
accounting office a congressional investigative agency to conduct 
a separate investigation 
the past decade was an experiment in the gettough approach to 
crime as the federal and state governments built more prisons 
imposed mandatory sentences and embraced capital punishment the 
report said 
we will never build enough cells to house everyone that can be 
brought into the prisons conyers said also theres no 
showing that increased incarceration has any deterrent effect 
whatsoever 
for white men in the 20 to 29 age group 1054508 or 62 
percent were incarcerated or on probation or parole a total of 
238255 hispanic males or 104 percent were in the criminal 
justice system 
although fewer young women than men were in the system there 
were racial disparities 164249 whites or 1 percent 78417 
blacks or 27 percent and 37093 hispanics or 18 percent 
stu smith a spokesman for the justice department said the 
reports numbers were accurate but declined further comment 
the report blames social ills including high unemployment 
rates for the disproportionate number of black men in the prison 
system 
conyers agreed noting that black men as a group are less 
educated and in poorer health than their white counterparts he 
also said the criminal justice system was racist in impact if not 
by intention with blacks more likely than whites to receive 
lengthy sentences or capital punishment 
to reverse the trend for blacks governments should prescribe 
counseling and other alternatives to prison for young firsttime 
offenders the study said for others mandatory sentencing 
guidelines should be loosened so judges can tailor each criminals 
punishment to his particular situation it said 
prison should be a last resort after alternative punishments 
have failed the report said urging governments to make greater 
use of restitution to victims community service intensive 
probation and employment and education programs

jesse jacksons political future is beginning 
to resemble his past 
his announcement monday that he will not run for mayor of the 
nations capital revived the assumption that when the 1992 
presidential campaign gets rolling jackson will make his third bid 
for the white house 
i want to continue to serve but not as mayor jackson told 
a news conference ending speculation that he might run to succeed 
the troubled marion barry as mayor of the district of columbia a 
city without a state 
serve as what was the next natural question 
it is premature to talk about the next level of activity he 
replied to such queries the push is for statehood 
jackson established residence in washington last spring a move 
that touched off speculation he would run for mayor the talk 
intensified after barry was arrested on a misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charge and later indicted on perjury charges 
many people were advising jackson to run 
they included some union and business leaders who regarded him 
as the best possibility for lifting the city out of a cycle of 
drugs and murder that has brought unwelcome headlines across the 
nation 
the advice also came from some of the veteran politicians who 
worked on the late stages of jacksons 1988 campaign for the 
democratic presidential nomination 
i thought he ought to run said john white a former 
democratic national party chairman it would give him a chance to 
develop some credibility on bigtime issues 
i thought he ought to do it said georgian bert lance who 
served as budget director for president jimmy carter i thought 
he could show his skill 
white and lance speculated that jacksons detractors would try 
to turn his reluctance to take on the challenges of mayor against 
him in the future 
i dont know how much bypassing this kind of challenge in a 
future race how much negative impact that would have white 
said but certainly he chose to pass it by 
the dc council is considering authorizing the election of two 
shadow senators to lobby congress for statehood jackson often 
is mentioned as a shooin for election to such a post 
i dont understand that shadow senator stuff white said 
i dont know whether he jackson has a real interest in it ive 
never heard him discuss it 
but for a real politician i dont see much interest in it 
politics is about power 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis the man who defeated jackson 
in the race for the 1988 presidential nomination reacted to 
jacksons announcement by saying 
im sorry about that he would have been a good candidate the 
job of mayor of the district is a national office in every sense of 
the word i wish he would have given it a whirl 
its not good for the city whats been happening said gov 
bill clinton of arkansas and we need to look at the city with 
pride again he could have made a contribution 
at present i believe that i may best serve by continuing my 
work on a national level to change the direction of this country i 
want to serve but not as mayor jackson said 
white said you have to almost predict a rerun of 88

relatives of two americans held captive 
in lebanon by proiranian factions say they are more optimistic 
than ever that all the western hostages in that country will soon 
be freed 
i feel much better than ive ever felt i feel very 
confident that the hostages will be released said ferial 
polhill her husband robert who taught at beirut university 
college was kidnapped on jan 24 1987 
peggy say sister of terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press said i feel somethings 
going to happen 
anderson 42 is the longest held of the 18 westerners kidnapped 
in lebanon he was abducted on march 16 1985 
there seems to be some kind of major impact looking at the 
fiveyear anniversary of terry anderson said mrs say who is 
winding up a humanitarian pilgrimage with an ap delegation to 
seek international support for the release of anderson and the 
other hostages 
i think it outrages people that for five years he and the 
other hostages have been held under such unspeakable conditions 
said mrs say who has tirelessly lobbied for her brothers release 
the other western hostages are six americans four britons two 
west germans two swiss an irishman and an italian most are 
believed held by proiranian shiite moslem factions linked to 
hezbollah or party of god an antiwestern fundamentalist faction 
mrs say of cadiz ky has met with pope john paul ii united 
nations secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar and palestine 
liberation organization chairman yasser arafat 
at the united nations monday kit and joan sutherland daughters 
of us hostage thomas sutherland presented perez de cuellar with 
a petition containing 18000 signatures from colorado appealing for 
help in seeking their fathers release 
sutherland on leave from colorado state university at fort 
collins was abducted june 9 1985 while serving as acting dean of 
agriculture at the american university of beirut 
mrs say flew to cyprus from damascus syria where she had met 
with foreign minister farouk alsharaa and information minister 
mohammed salman syria is the main power broker in lebanon mrs 
polhill a lebanese had come from beirut 
the two women sitting side by side in a nicosia hotel said 
they were greatly encouraged by recent statements in tehran and 
beirut about the hostages 
i feel this way particularly after the statements by iranian 
officials and by sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah said mrs 
polhill fadlallah hezbollahs spiritual guide and the most 
influential shiite cleric in lebanon said friday that ways had to 
be found to free the hostages 
irans chief justice mohammad yazdi declared sunday that islam 
opposed hostagetaking and there was no need for diplomatic 
maneuvering to free the hostages in lebanon 
this feeling is also prevalent in beirut after the latest 
statements it appears the hostages will be released 
unconditionally mrs polhill added 
mrs say said her increased optimism resulted from all the 
people that ive seen 
yazdis statement came amid other indications that the iranian 
government was moving to distance itself from the hostages 
the tehran times said in an editorial last week that the 
american hostages held in lebanon have become a tool to be used 
against iran and should be released the englishlanguage newspaper 
generally reflects the thinking of president hashemi rafsanjani 
leader of irans socalled pragmatists 
he is seeking to improve relations with the west to secure badly 
needed investment and technology to revitalize irans moribund 
economy 
but he is opposed by radical fundamentalists who charge he is 
deviating from the teachings of the islamic republics late 
founder ayatollah ruhollah khomeini who died june 3 
the tehran times report was followed sunday by an editorial in 
tehrans ettelaat daily that said the groups holding the 
foreigners should release them

the government is refusing to send its aids 
researchers into court to shed light on allegations that drug 
companies failed to move swiftly enough to prevent their blood 
products from transmitting the virus to children with hemophilia 
the centers for disease control contends aids researchers time 
is better spent in the laboratory lawyers for families of the aids 
victims say they believe both justice and science can be served by 
having the experts testify 
parents whose hemophiliac children have gotten aids from 
aidscontaminated blood are shocked that the federal government is 
refusing access to the truth about what information was given to 
people in the blood business in the early 1980s about the 
transmissibility of aids said laura anderson a miami attorney 
for families who are suing armour pharmaceutical of bradley ill 
and cutter laboratories of berkeley calif 
the government has won the first legal skirmishes most recently 
a ruling by a federal judge in atlanta that cdc experts cant be 
forced to testify in aidsrelated lawsuits 
senior us district judge charles a moye jr said he was 
concerned that compelling the experts to testify would subject the 
cdc to an onslaught of subpoenas for testimony on aids 
lawyers for families of the aids victims hope to win 
reconsideration of that ruling and a similar one in california 
the lawyers want to question aids experts bruce evatt and donald 
francis about their dealings with companies that make clotting 
products from donated blood 
according to documents filed in the case cdc researchers sent 
to at least one drug company a 1982 draft report saying 
hemophiliacs should be advised of this risk a suggestion 
missing from the cdcs subsequent official report 
the documents also say that francis advised a cdc colleague in a 
january 1983 memo that he feared it might be too late to 
prevent aids from spreading to hemophiliacs 
but he urged that the cdc recommend using only a very small pool 
of screened blood donors for manufacturing such products even 
though there will be objections by industry and blood bankers 
the atlanta ruling quashing a subpoena issued in florida means 
evatt does not have to testify but a larger issue remains when 
if ever cdc researchers should be compelled to testify in aids 
lawsuits 
the cdc has fielded about 50 requests in the last seven years 
for testimony from three top aids specialists the agency also has 
responded to more than 200 inquiries from lawyers concerned with 
such cases according to the cdc 
moye in his feb 6 order said the plaintiffs have a reasonable 
explanation for why they need evatts testimony but their 
interest in getting the deposition simply cannot compare to the 
governments interest in maximizing the use of its limited 
resources in dealing with a national health crisis 
the government contends research should take precedence 
weve taken a fairly hardnosed position on this said cdc 
legal adviser gene matthews we simply cant let our doctors and 
researchers who are spread thin as it is peel off time and go 
testifying 
a subpoena issued to francis a cdc expert in california was 
quashed by a federal magistrate there last year 
ms anderson suggested that if evatt were allowed to testify in 
her case his testimony could be videotaped and saved for use in 
other aids lawsuits 
she raised the possibility that the government wont allow the 
researchers to testify because of the possibility of embarrassing 
material coming out 
nothing was ever articulated specifically but that is sort of 
by implication what is going on ms anderson said 
cdc spokeswoman gail lloyd said the agency is not worried about 
anything embarrassing coming out in court 
already ms lloyd said we have supplied voluminous 
documents everything weve ever had has been supplied it is not 
an effort to withhold information 
francis and evatt have refused to comment on the lawsuits ms 
lloyd said 
theyre scientists and theyd just as soon do science the 
issue here is a legal issue not a scientific issue on this issue 
they just dont feel its their subject she said

the agriculture department is likely to 
continue a policy of releasing governmentowned surplus grain into 
the commercial market despite the objections of sen bob kerrey 
dneb 
kerrey had asked agriculture secretary clayton yeutter a 
nebraskan on the opposite side of the political fence to reverse a 
decision to dump on the market 55 million to 60 million bushels of 
corn owned by the commodity credit corp 
kerrey a member of the senate agriculture committee said last 
week that yeutters decision to issue new ccc catalogs or 
lists of grain inventories available to buyers was a clear 
signal to farmers that the agriculture department believes 
current corn prices of 225 per bushel are too high 
yeutter in a letter released monday by usda told kerrey that 
the catalogs help to move grain out of more expensive commercial 
storage and into the market to satisfy domestic and export demand 
kerrey said last week that the bush administration has been 
lecturing farmers to become more marketoriented and rely less on 
the government for their income but its decision to sell still 
more corn undermines the ability of farmers to heed that 
directive 
farmers who developed a thoughtful marketing plan have been told 
by usda that the government stands ready to erase any opportunity 
for better prices he said 
yeutter said he was troubled by kerreys request to keep the 
corn in ccc storage because most nebraska farmers know that in 
the long run american agriculture is far better off moving grain 
to market 
the early 1980s taught us that we cant store our way to 
prosperity yeutter said the grain recently cataloged had 
already been in storage for at least two to three years 
according to recent usda reports corn exports are expected to 
rise 12 percent this year to around 2275 billion bushels and 
domestic use may be up 9 percent to more than 57 billion bushels 
thus total corn use in the 198990 marketing year 798 
billion bushels will exceed last falls harvest of less than 753 
billion bushels 
as a result us corn stockpiles are expected to drop to 148 
billion bushels by the start of the next marketing year sept 1 
the first time since 198384 that the carryover has been below 15 
billion bushels 
the tight stocks mean that corn prices will be sensitive to 
weather conditions that may affect the planting and development of 
the 1990 corn crop one usda analysis said 
projections by the departments economic research service put 
corn prices in the range of 220 to 240 per bushel on the 
average over the 198990 marketing year compared with 254 
estimated for 198889 when drought reduced the supply and forced up 
prices

agriculture department economists say brisk 
exports and heavy domestic use are draining off us cotton 
inventories and boosting prices 
domestic mills used 78 million bales in 198889 the 
departments economic research service said monday in a preliminary 
report 
this season strong denim demand and apparel sales are 
expected to push consumption to 82 million bales the highest in 
nearly two decades the report said mill use for the first six 
months of the season average about 84 million bales on a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate 
cotton exports are forecast at 77 million bales this season up 
25 percent from 615 million bales in 198889 as of midfebruary 
outstanding sales and shipments totaled nearly 7 million bales 
compared with 47 million at this time last season 
the us cotton inventory by aug 1 is expected to be about 35 
million bales about half the 709 million on hand last aug 1 
during the 198990 marketing year both us and world prices 
for cotton have exceeded those of the past season by substantial 
margins the report said the adjusted world price for august 
to midnovember averaged 67 cents per pound this season about 23 
cents ahead of the comparableperiod average last season 
world cotton production was projected at about 79 million bales 
in 198990 down 6 percent from last year foreign production at 
around 67 million bales is down 3 percent the us harvest is 
estimated at 122 million bales down 21 percent

for the second time in a week the soviet 
union is planning to deny visas to members of congress seeking to 
watch local elections in that country according to lawmakers and 
the state department 
sen dennis deconcini dariz chairman of the us commission 
on security and cooperation in europe on monday criticized the 
soviets failure to provide visas to a group of house members who 
want to observe the elections in the ukraine on sunday 
we dont understand why moscow would want to keep us 
congressmen from observing the process of democratization in the 
ussr deconcini said in a statement the commission monitors 
the human rights aspects of the helsinki accords 
moscows clear unwillingness to permit us legislators to 
observe the political processes and elections runs counter to the 
trend of improved ussoviet relations and parliamentary 
contacts he said 
the group had planned to leave thursday but has yet to receive 
entry permits 
the soviets have told the lawmakers they do not have proper 
invitations to warrant visas said orest deychak a commission 
staff member house members were told invitations must be issued by 
the ukrainian supreme soviet 
a state department official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said soviet officials have given signals that visas would be 
denied to reps don ritter rpa a commission member john edward 
porter rill david drier rcalif dennis hertel dmich bob 
mcewen rohio and dan schaefer rcolo 
the congressmen have not been officially notified that they will 
not get visas 
a telephone number provided by the soviet embassy to ask 
questions about visas rang unanswered monday 
last week four house members flew to berlin intending to get 
visas to watch elections in lithuania on saturday the first 
multiparty contest in the soviet union since after the bolshevik 
revolution 
the group arrived wednesday in berlin where they remained until 
after the elections they were not permitted to enter lithuania 
until sunday night and they will return tuesday 
last friday 11 senators wrote a letter of protest to yuri 
dubinin the soviet ambassador to the united states calling for 
approval of the visas 
in addition secretary of state james a baker iii contacted 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze about the matter a 
state department official said 
although the congressmen reps richard durbin dill 
christopher cox rcalif john miller rwash and bill 
sarpalius dtexas only managed one day in lithuania the trip 
was worthwhile said durbins spokeswoman melissa batty 
they met with people she said adding that durbin who is 
of lithuanian descent also planned to visit his mothers hometown 
she said the group went to berlin because they had not expected 
to have trouble obtaining their visas

the president of a private trade school is 
refusing to answer senate investigators allegations that documents 
were altered to fatten profits from federal guaranteed student 
loans 
on advice of counsel i respectfully decline to answer the 
question joseph a calareso president of american career 
training corp replied when asked whether he had instructed anyone 
to doctor records 
staff members of the senate permanent investigations 
subcommittee testified monday that they found evidence suggesting 
intentional abuse of the guaranteed student loan system by the 
corporation and its two arms act travel school and hart school 
for professional secretaries both in pompano beach fla 
investigators allege that from 1986 through 1989 150 million 
in loans were guaranteed for 60000 students of the act schools 
which combine home study with oncampus courses 
calareso and his brother james who own the school paid 
themselves 12 million in salary and stock dividends during that 
time the investigators said joseph calareso earns 15 million a 
year as president 
im afraid they are just scratching the surface of deep 
problems in the program said sen sam nunn dga chairman of the 
subcommittee 
the system added sen william roth rdel seems to invite 
fraud and abuse 
subcommittee investigators david b buckley and grace t 
mcphearson targeted the act operations as part of a broader 
probe of abuses in the student loan programs act was chosen 
because of its heavy reliance on student loans 
brenda ann brandon said that when she was the organizations 
financialaid officer the school was receiving 200 to 250 
studentloan checks averaging 2000 to 2500 a week 
although federal regulations limit guaranteed loans to those who 
have completed high school or who are obtaining an equivalency 
diploma some of the students literally could not read or write 
some could not speak the english language mrs brandon said 
she said she had seen joseph calareso alter records of students 
who had no high school diploma 
in addition mrs brandon said employees were instructed by 
joseph calareso to contact every new student even cash students 
and try and get them to finance their education through a 
guaranteed student loan 
this way the school was guaranteed to receive the full 
tuition up front she said if a cash student is on a payment 
plan there is a lower probability that the school will receive all 
of the tuition because the majority of the students enrolled never 
complete the course 
senate investigators contend that 
in 1986 through 1989 90 percent of act students including 
some who did not meet federal requirements received federal aid 
but only 16 percent completed their courses 
the schools list only 23 instructors but 109 sales 
representatives trying to recruit students in 1989 from each 
1000 of revenue the schools spent 4 on classroom materials 14 
on instructors salaries and 338 on advertising 
in 1985 the first year it was eligible to participate in 
federal studentloan programs act revenues increased by 800 
percent to 55 million investigators testified revenues reached 
345 million in 1989 
andrea lynn merrittswest of new smyrna beach fla told the 
subcommittee that within a week after enrolling in the travel 
school she received a filledin form that she learned months 
later was an application for a guaranteed student loan 
she said she received a 2650 check from act and following 
instructions endorsed it and returned it to the school she 
dropped out a few months later and eventually was notified by a 
private lender that she was about to default on a government loan 
this is the first time that i had ever been told that i had 
received a government student loan she said

increasing the payload on a spacecraft can 
make it more economical but so can sending up a series of smaller 
satellites a congressional study says 
the office of technology assessment proposes fatsats 
lightsats and microspacecraft as possible solutions in the 
quest for a cheaper space program 
with payloads costing up to 800000 a pound the congressional 
office has been looking at offbeat technologies that can reduce 
costs one idea in the study released monday proposes to launch 
10000 small projectiles a year for as little as 500 a pound for 
the payload and 20 a pound for the launcher 
unless spacecraft costs are reduced even dramatic reductions 
in launch costs will have only a small effect on total spacecraft 
program costs said the report affordable spacecraft design 
and launch alternatives 
the study follows otas buyers guide to launch options its 
big dumb booster a lowcost space transportation option and 
its study of human spaceflight a summary report on space 
transportation will be published in the spring 
reducing the cost of launchers will have only a small impact on 
overall costs and new strategies are needed to cut the cost of 
payloads the report concludes 
the report proposes 
requiring payload designers to include a margin for weight 
overruns to avoid the long delays and high cost of redesigning 
spacecraft that tend to grow in size and weight during production 
and gross out their intended launchers 
allowing fatsats or spacecraft that are built larger with 
lessexpensive materials to keep costs down the money saved can 
far exceed the increased cost of a larger launcher 
making more lightsats that weigh less but have fewer 
capabilities the idea is that for some applications launching an 
array of small and simple satellites instead of one large 
sophisticated vehicle could cut costs 
building small instruments for small rugged satellites that 
can be launched by laserpowered or cannonlike launchers 
the study suggests several options for congress including 
legislation that would require two design contracts for a selected 
new spacecraft a conventional one and one that would consider 
unconventional approaches 
ota proposes that congress require the national aeronautics 
space administration to include 15 percent weight margins in its 
new designs 
the study also suggests funding of programs to build larger 
launchers that could carry fatsats and continued funding for 
military development of launch vehicles for lightsats

after getting residents to cut back on 
driving officials of this smogchoked metropolis are expanding 
antipollution measures to move steel works out of town and 
encourage buses and trucks to use propane 
in addition all vehicles will now be required to submit to 
emissions inspections 
the new measures mayor manuel camacho solis announced monday 
step up the battle to cut some of the 48 million tons of 
pollutants spewed every year into the air breathed by the capitals 
18 million residents 
we are determined and we have the overwhelming support of an 
equally determined citizenry to go ahead and make next winter even 
less contaminated than this winter was the mayor told a news 
conference 
an experimental program that started nov 20 its main feature 
being to force people not to drive one day a week had been 
scheduled to end wednesday but was extended for at least two months 
the period corresponded to the winter seasons thermal 
inversions when cold air traps huge quantities of toxic gases 
during the early hours of the morning in the valley of mexico 
camacho said the program was so successful that when city 
authorities conducted a series of public opinion polls 70 to 90 
percent of those questioned said they favored extending it 
while the measure only was intended to cut pollution by 23 
percent the reduction was only about half that 
still camacho said you can see the results on many days you 
could even see the volcanoes surrounding the city very clearly 
similarly camacho announced that the sale of oxygenated 
gasoline and the substitution of natural gas for fuel oil in mexico 
city two huge power plants part of the experimental program 
would continue 
adding the oxygencompound additive to gasoline raises 
combustion levels and sharply reduces pollutants especially in 
mexico where emission control devices are not mandatory experts 
say 
petroleos mexicanos sa the goverments oil monopoly will 
continue providing 109 million cubic feet of natural gas to replace 
the 16000 barrels of fuel oil the capitals two power plants had 
burned daily he said 
by the time winter sets in again next november camacho said 
all metal foundries will be forced to resettle outside the valley 
under an agreement the city recently negotiated with the state of 
mexico 
the rest of the areas industries will be gradually forced to 
install antipollution devices or move out camacho said 
camacho said pemex will also start marketing lowcost liquid 
propane gas to encourage bus lines and delivery trucks to convert 
their gasoline engines to the less polluting fuel 
also for next winter all taxis trucks and buses will be forced 
to undergo periodic emission control testing testing was required 
only for private automobiles this winter

gay rights activists say a supreme court 
rebuff will not deter their continuing fight to overturn a general 
ban on homosexuals in the armed forces 
there are other remedies for us to take care of this deeply 
irrational policy said peri jude radecic of the national gay and 
lesbian task force weve had a great deal of congressional 
interest in this within the next year youll see some good things 
coming from congress 
the court monday refused to disturb pentagon policy which says 
homosexuality is incompatible with military service 
the court rejected appeals by miriam benshalom denied 
reenlistment in the army reserve in wisconsin because she is a 
lesbian and james m woodward of spring valley calif released 
from active navy duty because he is gay 
the refusal to allow lesbian and gay americans to enlist in 
the military constitutes what is probably the most blatant example 
of official discrimination by the federal government today said 
nan hunter of the american civil liberties union 
ms benshalom said after the courts announcement that she may 
leave the united states 
ive considered holland because they consider people like me 
as legitimate political refugees she said 
army spokesman joe padilla said the service was pleased that 
this longstanding litigation is finally terminated and that our 
position has been upheld 
ms benshalom who joined the army reserve in 1974 and rose to 
rank of sergeant served out an enlistment that ended in august 
1988 
the army bars persons who engage in homosexual conduct or who 
by their statements demonstrate a propensity to engage in 
homosexual conduct 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals upheld the policy in 
august but noted that there never was a complaint about ms 
benshaloms military record 
woodward was allowed to enlist in 1972 for a sixyear hitch in 
the naval flight officer candidate program even though he answered 
yes to a questionnaire asking whether he was sexually attracted 
to men or desired sex with men woodward wrote no when asked 
whether he ever had engaged in homosexual conduct 
the navy has allowed some homosexuals to serve despite its 
general policy 
ensign woodward was serving in the philippines in 1974 when he 
was seen in the subic bay officers club sitting with a sailor who 
was to be discharged for homosexual conduct 
questioned by his commanding officer woodward acknowledged his 
homosexual tendencies but said for the good of both the navy and 
myself i respectfully request the chance to contribute to the 
defense of the united states as an honest open gay officer 
the navy released him from active duty and assigned him to the 
naval air reserve staff in san diego where he served until his 
discharge in 1978 
in other action monday the supreme court 
heard arguments over a federal regulation putting postal 
service property offlimits to solicitors of contributions a 
ruling is expected by july 
said it will decide in a west virginia case whether a federal 
law that requires some losers of lawsuits to pay the winners 
lawyer fees also covers fees for expert witnesses 
refused to force the cia to release documents on the 1985 
sinking of the greenpeace ship rainbow warrior by french government 
agents 
let stand a 15year prison sentence and a 66 million fine 
imposed on california businessman edward elkins for selling two 
airplanes with a potential military use to libya

energy secretary james d watkins says a waste 
storage problem that threatened the future of the rocky flats 
nuclear weapons plant has been resolved at least until late 1991 
thats a rare piece of welcome news for rocky flats which is 
shut down for safety and management improvements the plant 16 
miles northwest of denver also is under fbi investigation for 
possible criminal violation of environmental laws 
rocky flats is the nations sole source of plutonium triggers 
for nuclear weapons 
watkins told a meeting of the national governors association on 
monday that a program of waste minimization at rocky flats will 
keep the plant within its limits of plutonium waste storage until 
august by then he said the department expects to begin operating 
a special waste compactor that will enable rocky flats to handle 
all its own waste until late 1991 no specific date was mentioned 
it was thought that rocky flats would reach its waste limit this 
spring 
rocky flats had been sending its excess waste to a weapons 
facility in idaho but when idaho gov cecil andrus blocked further 
shipments last year watkins launched an illfated effort to 
persuade seven states colorado washington idaho nevada new 
mexico tennessee and south carolina to take equal amounts of 
rocky flats waste 
watkins pleaded on national security grounds but all seven 
states turned him down 
the watkins sevenstate plan was based on the assumption that 
rocky flats would reach its waste storage limit of 1600 cubic 
yards by march or april 1990 
the department recently indicated that the crunch might be 
delayed slightly but watkins statement monday was the first word 
of a major change in circumstances 
eventually the rocky flats waste is supposed to go to a 
permanent underground storage site in the new mexico desert but 
efforts to open that facility originally scheduled for 1988 
have been plagued by delay watkins has said the new mexico dump 
could be available late this year but new delays are possible and 
the facility is unlikely to be in full operation until 1992 or 
later 
in his remarks to the governors meeting watkins said the key to 
relieving the wastestorage pressure at rocky flats was a program 
undertaken by the department and its rocky flats contractor to 
segregate and minimize the generation of plutonium wastes 
this effort has been effective in reducing the generation rate 
from 130 cubic yards per month in march 1989 to 70 cubic yards per 
month watkins said 
calls to watkins aides seeking additional details on how waste 
generation was minimized were not returned 
in a related development the department issued a report 
critical of rockwell international corp which operated rocky 
flats until the end of last year the company agreed to withdraw 
from its contract early because of a dispute with watkins over its 
approach to rocky flats environmental and safety problems 
the department said it was paying rockwell 2 million for 
running rocky flats from april through september 1989 a cut from 
the 82 million it could have earned the department said 
rockwells handling of environmental safety and health programs 
was unsatisfactory and that management was not totally 
responsive to the departments requirements 
rockwell insisted it put a high priority on environmental and 
safety issues

the legislature is opening a special 
session with its work cut out for it by the courts which found 
texas discriminates in the way it funds schools and elects judges 
gov bill clements called the 30day session beginning today 
after the state supreme court found glaring disparities in 
funding available to rich and poor districts and after a federal 
court ruled that judicial elections in nine urban counties 
discriminated against minorities 
the state court gave lawmakers until may 1 to overhaul financing 
for the nations secondlargest school system with 33 million 
students in 1100 districts only californias school system is 
larger 
texas schools are funded with local property taxes and state 
aid funding totals more than 13 billion a year the court found 
that because of disparities in property values annual spending per 
student among texas districts ranges from 2112 to 19333 
in a 90 ruling in october the court said it would not tell the 
legislature how to correct the inequities or order it to increase 
taxes but warned a bandaid will not suffice the system itself 
must be changed 
at least six major funding proposals including one costing more 
than 1 billion are before legislators 
but state comptroller bob bullock warned lawmakers there is no 
money available for school funding reform if they do spend 
additional money they need to raise it or forever hold their 
peace he said monday 
the superintendent of san antonios edgewood school district 
the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit challenging the current school 
funding system said its time the system was made fairer 
its been too long that thousands of children in this state 
over the last 20 years have had to go through systems of education 
that did not provide them the quality of education because of a 
lack of basic equity in the school finance system james vasquez 
said 
the legislature was forced to take up election reform after a 
federal judge found that countywide elections for district judges 
in nine counties violated the voting rights act of 1965 by watering 
down black and hispanic voting strength 
at the time of us district judge lucius buntons ruling in 
november nonhispanic whites held 155 of the 172 district 
judgeships in the nine counties while blacks and hispanics make up 
about onethird of the states poulation 
bunton began dividing the counties into judicial districts in 
line and in january he ordered special elections in may for 115 
judgeships in the counties nearly onethird of the states 375 
district judges 
but a federal appeals court halted the elections saying 
lawmakers should be allowed to draw up the judicial districts

foreign journalists say plainclothes police have 
been tailing them more often even while they jog or shop in the 
month since the government lifted martial law in the chinese 
capital 
reporters said monday that as a result they have been more 
cautious about talking to chinese not wanting to get them in 
trouble with authorities 
several chinese contacts have been hauled before the leaders 
in their work units and told we know you had contact with a 
foreign journalist and this must stop said a british reporter 
like the other journalists he spoke on condition of anonymity 
for fear of provoking official retaliation against his chinese 
friends 
correspondents from nearly a dozen news organizations including 
those from the united states soviet union and europe said they 
have been tailed at least once by plainclothes police in recent 
weeks 
since june when the government crushed studentled protests for 
democracy official access has been more limited and even many 
ordinary factories and offices are afraid to let reporters visit 
for interviews 
under martial law imposed in beijing during the protests 
foreign reporters were required to get military approval for all 
interviews the requirement lapsed with the jan 11 lifting of 
martial law but the police surveillance appeared to be a 
substitute measure 
the british reporter said he had been tailed each of the past 
three days and that on one occasion plainclothes police tried to 
photograph him meeting a chinese friend in a park 
the next day police followed him to a hotel where he met a 
chinese acquaintance and three motorcycles and a van followed his 
car from the hotel keeping pace when he accelerated and drove in 
circles after he dropped off the chinese man police pursued the 
man on foot the reporter said 
an american reporter who noticed she was being tailed by a man 
on a bicycle said it made her decide not to visit chinese friends 
so i guess its working 
she and several other reporters believe the surveillance which 
in many cases has been obvious is intended to discourage them from 
normal contacts with chinese friends or news sources 
what were all terribly concerned about is getting a chinese 
in trouble said another american reporter who said he and his 
wife were followed even when they went jogging 
in the past chinese have been accused of giving state secrets 
to foreigners with whom they were friendly and in some instances 
have been jailed 
others have been denied promotions or the chance to study abroad 
because of friendship with a foreigner 
without chinese friends foreigners find themselves cut off 
entirely from chinese society isolated in their separate apartment 
compounds and with little access to officials 
china does not censor the writings of foreign reporters 
however it censors foreign news entering the country 
authorities tear out articles they consider objectionable before 
allowing newspapers and magazines to go on sale in hotels 
chineselanguage broadcasts of the usrun radio station the 
voice of america have been jammed since june

the congressional budget office says the 
federal government could save 545 billion over five years by 
ending subsidized loans that help sell us products abroad 
outlays of 43 billion are foreseen from 1991 to 1995 under the 
food for peace program which provides loans to third world 
countries to buy surplus us farm products 
loans can be extended to 40 years at interest rates averaging 2 
percent to 3 percent a year a much longer term and much lower rate 
than any bank would provide 
the detailed report by the bipartisan agency which presents 
pros and cons but does not make recommendations to congress 
recently became available 
typically according to the report on possible changes in 
revenue and spending the subsidies average 70 percent of the 
market price governments that buy the food sell it on their home 
markets and use the proceeds for development projects or other 
official spending 
the marketing of some food commodities most notably wheat and 
wheat flour still relies significantly on foodaid programs it 
said 
some recipient countries according to the report complain that 
the loans are not really aid because most must eventually be repaid 
the report said the money from sales is being used increasingly 
for development projects and that the loans remain one of the few 
international policy tools in us government hands 
to sell american industrial products subsidized loans are made 
by the governments exportimport bank largely in the third world 
savings from abolishing it are estimated at 115 billion over five 
years 
the loans are defended on the ground they create jobs counter 
similar subsidies from us competitors such as france and japan 
and help us hightechnology companies keep up high rates of 
output 
however the report said much of the aid is given to exports 
that dont face foreign competition 
direct subsidies to us manufacturing would be more 
costeffective the report said

prime minister toshiki kaifu was reelected to 
japans highest government post tuesday and immediately began 
efforts to form a cabinet that will reflect his newfound political 
muscle 
kaifu bowed as his formal reelection was proclaimed after a 
vote in the lower house of parliament and hailed by a round of 
rousing applause and scattered cheers 
of 508 valid votes cast in the 512seat chamber kaifu won 286 
his closest rival socialist party chairwoman takako doi received 
146 votes kaifu needed 255 votes for a majority 
immediately after the lower house vote kaifu rushed off without 
comment to meet party leaders to work out a cabinet lineup 
in the 252seat upper house which is controlled by the 
opposition kaifu failed to win a clear majority in the first round 
of voting but won in a runoff with 111 of the 246 votes cast ms 
doi garnered 91 votes and 44 ballots were left blank 
the decision of the lower house is final as the chamber by law 
can name a prime minister without upper house assent a lack of 
consensus is rare however when kaifu first assumed office six 
months ago he was the first prime minister in 41 years not 
nominated by both houses 
both houses convened tuesday for a special 120day session the 
first since kaifu steered his liberal democratic party through 
difficult elections for the lower house feb 18 
kaifu has strengthened his hand since the elections but powerful 
party leaders have challenged his move to keep scandaltainted 
politicians from the new cabinet officials said monday 
kaifu and party elders agreed monday to reappoint finance 
minister ryutaro hashimoto and foreign minister taro nakayama 
party officials said speaking on condition of anonymity the 
ministers were to continue work on issues such as an unpopular 
sales tax and trade friction with the united states 
the tax and an influencepeddling scandal which tainted many 
party elders stirred doubts over whether the liberal democrats 
could keep their 34yearold hold on power 
kaifu who has a clean image but weak power base assumed the 
party leadership in august after the influencepeddling and a sex 
scandal forced two predecessors to step down and the party lost 
upper house elections in july 
kaifu 59 formed an unusually young cabinet and for the first 
time gave two important ministerial posts to women but his image 
suffered from a public perception of him as manipulated by elders 
who assumed low profiles because of links to the recruit scandal 
the feb 18 voting left the liberal democrats with a comfortable 
lower house majority however and kaifu suggested the results 
should strengthen his leadership position 
last week kaifu strongly opposed recommendations to name two 
lawmakers linked to the recruit scandal to top party posts party 
officials said after lengthy negotiations kaifu appointed only 
one 
but two major factions within the governing party have suggested 
kaifu include in the new cabinet at least two senior politicians 
linked to bribery scandals despite the prime ministers efforts to 
protect his administrations image news reports said 
the faction led by former foreign minister shintaro abe insisted 
that former education minister yoshiro mori who was one of 16 
politicians linked to the recruit stock scandal should be given 
one of the most prestigious posts party officials said 
kaifu however took an unusually strong stance and told party 
secretary general ichiro ozawa he would not include politicians 
tainted by the recruit scandal ozawa eventually convinced abe to 
withdraw his request and by late monday mori announced he would 
not seek a post in the cabinet 
one party official said it would have been unthinkable for mr 
kaifu to exert such a strong initiative before the election 
another powerful faction led by former finance minister michio 
watanabe has been insisting that takayuki sato who was given a 
suspended sentence in the lockheed bribery scandal in the 1970s be 
included in the cabinet officials said 
the liberal democratic party which has governed japan since it 
was formed in 1955 comprises four major factions and two smaller 
groups including kaifus it is considered one of the prime 
ministers most important tasks to form a cabinet based on his own 
desires without upsetting the factional balance 
in the 1988 scandal surrounding the recruit co key politicians 
acknowledged they received large donations from the information 
conglomerate in return for political favors

miriam benshalom said she has lost faith in 
the country she wants to serve after the us supreme court left 
intact a military policy that keeps her out of the army reserve 
because she is a lesbian 
i keep wondering if there is a place out there that will 
accept me for the human being that i am ms benshalom who 
fought the ban on homosexuals for 16 years said monday night 
i feel devastated i am angry i am hurt i am outraged she 
said i also have lost faith in america i still love america 
but will somebody please tell me what i need to do to be fit for 
the rest of my life will appear the words unfit to serve her 
country 
ms benshalom 41 joined the reserve in 1974 and was 
discharged in 1976 after she acknowledged being a lesbian army 
policy at the time barred anyone who evidenced homosexual 
tendencies desire or interest 
a federal judge ordered ms benshalom reinstated and she 
served out an enlistment that ended in august 1988 but she was 
barred from reenlisting under amended army policy that calls 
homosexuality incompatible with military service 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals in august upheld the 
policy although acknowledging there never was any complaint about 
ms benshaloms performance of her military duties the court said 
the army acted to protect morale discipline and the 
effectiveness of our fighting forces 
on monday the supreme court without comment refused to hear 
ms benshaloms appeal 
we are pleased that this longstanding litigation brought by 
ms miriam benshalom against the us army is finally terminated 
and that our position has been upheld army spokesman joe padilla 
said 
the court also summarily rejected an appeal by james m woodward 
of spring valley calif who sued in 1976 after he was released 
from active duty in the navy because he is gay 
in both cases the supreme court did not rule on the legality of 
the ban 
my record and the record of all the other gay veterans speak 
for themselves woodward said monday i wasnt on the fast 
track for an admiralty or anything but i was a competent officer 
and did my job 
both former soldiers promised to continue their fight through 
other channels including congress and veterans groups 
ms benshalom said the ban on homosexuals persecutes people for 
being honest right now there are a class of people who if 
they tell the truth about themselves they are considered to be 
felons i think that stinks she said 
ms benshalom who teaches at a high school and a technical 
college in milwaukee said she fears an unfavorable discharge could 
affect her teaching career 
but she said the army will have to acknowlege that she has an 
impeccable service record 
the fact of the matter is that they cant pretend that i was 
never there she said

the defense department doesnt have a sound 
missionbased justification to spend an estimated 532 million to 
buy 34 additional helicopters for commando missions a 
congressional report says 
but the defense department said plans to cancel the new v22 
osprey vertical takeoff airplane make the additional helicopters 
necessary 
the general accounting office said monday the army based its 
decision to buy 34 mh47e helicopters from the boeing cos 
philadelphiabased helicopters division in addition to its own 
needs of 17 on a may 1984 agreement between the army and the air 
force 
the accord said the air force would transfer the responsibility 
for providing helicopter support for commando operations to the 
army 
but in june 1987 the defense department told congress that it 
had revised its requirements and only needed 17 mh47e helicopters 
and 41 mh53j helicopters to fly these missions of about 265 to 
520 miles 
the armys reason for procuring an additional 34 mh47e 
aircraft is based on an earlier memorandum of agreement between the 
air force and the army which has been superseded by the 1987 
report the gao said

they were full of vigor and 
revolutionary fervor fresh from the mountains and battles and 
ready to spread the gospel of marx 
as their 10 years in power came to an end they could list 
among their accomplishments improved educational and health systems 
and in a final irony that could only be confirmed by accepting 
defeat democracy 
they were the sandinistas young guerrillas who looked to cubas 
socialist society as a model after they smashed the corrupt 
capitalist system of dictator anastasio somozas regime 
in recent years dismayed by the disparity between economic 
theory and practice they denied they were marxists and became 
believers in private property and a mixed economy 
they sought improved relations with a roman catholic church they 
had attacked and vilified in the person of cardinal miguel obando y 
bravo 
but they were booted on sunday by an electorate fed up with 
economic crisis the eightyear war with usbacked contra rebels 
internal political polarization and a confrontation with washington 
that led to regional isolation 
i dont think we were ever real marxists said a 
highranking official on condition of anonymity we read mostly 
bad translations in mexico we will probably end up as social 
democrats 
but whether marxists or social democrats the sandinistas with 
their blackandred bandannas their youthfully dogmatic policies 
antius rhetoric and social reforms left an imprint on the soul 
of nicaragua 
there is no question that there was a revolution here and it 
cannot be reversed whether you agree with it or not said the 
rev bismarck carballo a bitter critic of the sandinistas 
even critics acknowledge that the sandinistas changed nicaragua 
and like to speculate on how things might have been different had 
the sandinistas not been so bitterly antiamerican 
the united states which provided nearly 100 million in aid in 
the months following the somoza overthrow turned against them 
accusing them of domestic repression and of going back on pledges 
they would found a politically pluralistic and democratic society 
eventually the united states financed the contra rebels that 
tied up tens of thousands of sandinista soldiers and drained more 
than 40 per cent of the countrys budget 
the sandinistas first accomplishment was a massive literacy 
campaign in which they involved young idealistic youths who went 
into the mountains to suffer with peasants while teaching them to 
read and write along with the basic tenets of sandinismo a 
nationalist mixture of populism and marxism 
as they pulled away from their central american neighbors and 
from the united states they brought in cuban and eastern european 
technicians to build schools and hospitals 
their concern for social needs made them popular among the 
socalled internationalist set that attached itself to 
antius causes 
they confiscated banks and controlled foreign trade they 
established free higher education eliminated polio and reduced 
infant mortality established price controls and gave away tens of 
thousands of lots for housing 
brigades of volunteers from europe and the united states came to 
nicaragua to help pick coffee in the daytime and sing revolutionary 
songs at night 
the sandinistas confiscated tens of thousands of acres giving 
it to thousands of landless peasants whom they organized into 
cooperatives 
but that and the draft drove thousands into the arms of the 
contras and created hostility across broad swaths of the 
countryside 
they antagonized a powerful business class confiscating 
property and irritated the establishment church in this staunchley 
roman catholic land with their support of the socalled popular 
church 
many companies became property of the state and began losing 
money under the guidance of inexperienced and dogmatic managers who 
sacrificed efficiency in the name of worker control or 
egalitarianism 
the sandinistas also irritated their regional neighbors with 
open support of the leftist rebels of neighboring el salvador who 
found a haven in nicaragua and a steady supply of weapons 
eventually bureaucracy rigid state planning and a us economic 
embargo sent the sandinista economy into a dive 
they defeated the contra militarily but they could not defeat 
the economic crisis said mauricio diaz leader of the social 
christian party 
their economy became closely tied to that of eastern european 
countries and cuba 
for years practically every local product was rationed gasoline 
was limited to 20 gallons a month per car and most imported items 
were expensive and of low quality 
we were not just committed to economic growth but to social 
and economic equality wrote governnent official edmundo jarquin 
in a recent article 
in recent years under pressure from european countries and as 
their east bloc allies abandoned centrally planned socialism the 
sandinistas began seeking closer ties with the united states 
their biggest accomplishment ironically caused their undoing 
they promised and carried out a clean fair election and when 
the electorate turned against them they promised to respect the 
voters decision 
we are proud regardless of the results to give nicaragua and 
the underdeveloped countries of america a bit of dignity a bit of 
democracy and a bit of social justice ortega said with painful 
pride as he acknowledged defeat

a fine cast which included a performer making 
his metropolitan opera debut made abduction from the seraglio 
a musical and visual treat 
james levine conducted the mozart comedy with dash on monday 
night 
lars magnusson a principal lyric tenor with the royal opera in 
stockholm was making his us opera debut as pedrillo servant of 
belmonte a spanish nobleman its the role he sang for his 1987 
debut at covent garden and will sing for his san francisco opera 
debut next season 
he has an unusual light tenor voice it doesnt get heavy but it 
does have character 
its as though it has been given a light layer of woodgrained 
baritone tonal quality the way colored varnish might be brushed 
onto a light wood it sounds right for david in die 
meistersinger which was magnussons paris opera debut role 
stanford olsen of salt lake city provided a good tenor contrast 
as belmonte olsen sounded serious his voice focused and seemingly 
ready to sing oratorio 
mariella devia of imperia italy sang konstanze the young 
woman who has been captured by pirates and sold to the pasha for 
his harem her maid blondchen and pedrillo are captives in the 
pashas residence seraglio with her 
miss devias singing was like a string of pearls her tone 
sweet each note carefully rounded and clear both she and barbara 
kilduff as blonchen had coloratura passages and both sang them 
beautifully 
miss kilduffs acting was more understated and less relentlessly 
pert than some who sing blonchen but magnusson was more nimble 
than most who sing pedrillo so the balance of that pair of 
sweethearts was maintained 
bass kurt moll of buir germany was osmin the pashas 
overseer he was the only one in the cast who sang his part when 
this production was introduced in 1979 moll has a voice of depth 
and richness and he has added some effective bits of comedy to a 
portrayal that already was very funny 
nico castel took the speaking part of the pasha he creates the 
happy ending after osmin discovers the abduction attempt by 
wandering around and sticking his arm through the plotters ladder

university of texas groundskeepers launched 
a pyrotechnic assault that finally chased hundreds of cackling 
grackles from the campus but they ruffled some gubernatorial 
feathers in the process 
university officials had tried for five years to chase away the 
grackles small blackbirds that taunted students with their 
cackling and soiled sidewalks with their plentiful droppings 
for four straight nights this month groundskeepers armed with 
exploding roman candletype devices waged an allout artillery 
offensive finally succeeding in shooing the birds offcampus 
the birds headed south straight for the governors mansion 
less than a mile away 
they converged on the lawn in one big mad squawking flock as 
if demanding an audience with gov bill clements himself he was 
not home 
the staff immediately knew where the birds came from and called 
university officials said anne debois the mansions administrator 
we dont want the grackles here she said they are 
unwelcome tourists 
so the university sent their birdbombers to the mansion to 
drive the flock away 
were waiting to see whether they come back said howard 
wilson university maintenance chief but for the time being 
its now a much nicer place

but womens groups on campus have said its a step forward that 
a woman even felt she could apply for the job mcclure said

nasa set its sights on a sixth 
attempt early wednesday to launch space shuttle atlantis on a 
secret military mission but the weather forecast still looked dim 
air force forecasters said there was only a 40 percent chance 
the weather would allow liftoff at 1245 am high winds and clouds 
are expected to move into the launch area and the outlook for 
thursday is about the same 
the five delays in as many days have so far have cost nasa 275 
million in fuel labor and materials 
atlantis mission is classified but sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said the shuttle is on a 4day mission to 
put in orbit a 500 million satellite capable of taking detailed 
photos and listening in on electronic communications over much of 
the world 
the latest postponement came early monday nasa kept the 
spacecraft and crew poised for favorable conditions but good 
weather never developed and the space agency decided to hold off 
for 48 hours before trying again 
its going to give us all a chance to get some rest said 
nasa spokesman bruce buckingham 
atlantis commander john o creighton a navy captain led two 
members of his fiveman allmilitary crew back to houston on 
monday for tuneup training at the johnson space center they were 
to return to the kennedy space center today 
atlantis was delayed twice because of weather and creightons 
sore throat and nasal congestion weather alone caused two other 
delays and a failed computer was blamed for another the first 
attempt was last thursday 
a sixth delay will tie atlantis for the number of launch 
postponements experienced by two earlier missions columbia lifted 
off jan 12 1986 after six delays caused by weather and mechanical 
problems challengers illfated launch on jan 28 1986 came after

rocky balboa is down but not out 
a crew worked two hours with a diamondtipped circular saw and 
jackhammer to free the 8foot bronze likeness of the movie boxing 
champ from the steps of the philadelphia museum of art before 
returning it to the spectrum sports arena 
but fans of the south philadelphia palooka played by sylvester 
stallone said monday they will fight to return the 800pound statue 
to the stone stairway made famous in the original rocky 
museum president robert montgomery scott has said the statue is 
a movie prop not art and he doesnt want it in front of the 
classical building 
among those working to keep the statue there is james binns a 
lawyer and former boxing commissioner hired by stallone in binns 
corner is mayor w wilson goode who has come out in favor of the 
statue as a tourist attraction 
the city art commission said it will wait 60 days before 
determining whether the statue of rocky in boxing trunks arms 
raised in triumph will be returned to the steps 
the statue which first appeared at the museum during the 
shooting of rocky iii in 1981 was brought back from the 
spectrum for filming of rocky v 
filming ended friday clearing the way for the producers to 
honor their contract to move the statue 
i feel kind of bad said bret carpin one of the workers who 
cut the figure from its concrete base i hope he doesnt hold it 
against us 
the museum was closed monday as usual but a crowd of tv camera 
crews photographers and curious museum employees circled the 
statue 
before the movers arrived more than 30 members of a high school 
swim team from jacksonville fla came to see the statue while in 
town for a swim meet it was the first tourist site they saw even 
before the liberty bell 
in the original rocky which won the oscar for best picture 
in 1976 rocky runs up the stone steps in triumph while training 
for a fight 
the los angeles publicist for rocky v dave fulton said of 
the statues fate its pretty much up to the people of

a canceled meeting between club owners and the 
baseball players union sent the spring training lockout into its 
13th day today and dimmed the prospects of the season opening on 
time 
union chief donald fehr canceled negotiations monday with the 
owners who he said offered nothing new in a dispute that is mostly 
over what year in their careers players can enter into salary 
arbitration players want that right after two years instead of 
three 
owners and players say a minimum of three weeks of spring 
training and several days for players to travel to camps are needed 
before the season can begin on time april 2 no new talks were 
scheduled 
the season is in very heavy jeopardy baseball commissioner 
fay vincent said monday he said he sympathized with fans who 
endured a 50day strike in 1981 and he called the standoff 
tragic to the point of absurdity 
fourteen of the nations governors sent a letter to vincent on 
monday calling the labor dispute a national disgrace 
baseball is too important to our country both economically 
and culturally to allow this to drag on the letter said 
minimum salary player benefits and team roster size are also at 
issue

supporters of his victorious rival 
cheered president daniel ortega at length as he entered the home of 
violeta barrios de chamorro and embraced her offering his help in 
national reconciliation 
there are neither winners nor losers here daniel mrs 
chamorro told the man she defeated in a stunning electoral upset 
the previous day 
the short congratulatory visit was another statesmanlike gesture 
from the 44yearold revolutionary leader of this country torn by 
civil war and partisan bitterness 
earlier monday ortega conceded defeat in an eloquent 
impassioned television speech 
he said his sandinistas would honor the voters wishes and 
after 10 years of oneparty rule surrender power to the fractious 
6monthold united nationalist opposition uno alliance mrs 
chamorro led to victory 
when ortega visited mrs chamorro accompanied by key 
international observers including former president jimmy carter 
she greeted him warmly 
come here my darling she told ortega i love you very 
much 
the postelection holiday was mostly quiet and transition talks 
began between sandinista and uno leaders there were however 
brief clashes in the capital between inebriated sandinista and 
opposition militants 
ortega may have lost sundays peaceful election but his 
sandinistas remain the countrys largest party and control the 
military as they go into transition talks with mrs chamorros 
usbacked coalition 
he has promised to relinquish power to mrs chamorro on april 
25 when the 60yearold publisher of the countrys only opposition 
newspaper is to be inaugurated for a sixyear term 
but he will become a member of the national assembly where 
sundays elections put the sandinistas in opposition 
for a year after the 1979 revolution that toppled the corrupt 
somoza regime ortega had shared podiums with mrs chamorro whose 
husbands assassination a year earlier helped ignite the sandinista 
revolution 
but she became disillusioned with the leftist sandinistas as 
they turned repressive and dogmatic and left the revolutionary 
leadership 
in 1981 with former president reagans blessing and support 
the contra rebel insurgency was launched us trade sanctions 
followed and before long the centrally planned poorly managed 
economy was in decline 
mrs chamorro then inherits a country wracked by inflation 
with a huge trade imbalance and will surely be seeking substantial 
us aid 
in washington there was elation and bush adminstration 
officials said lifting the us economic embargo was under 
discussion 
president bush called on both the sandinistas and contras to 
exercise restraint given the clear mandate for peace and 
democracy there is no reason at all for further military activity 
from any quarter 
with 82 per cent of the vote counted mrs chamorro was leading 
ortega by 633357 votes or 552 per cent to 468040 votes or 
408 per cent the breakdown of 90 directly elected national 
assembly seats had not been announced but ortega was certain to 
receive one of the special seats reserved for losing presidential 
candidates who win more than 1 percent of the vote 
on monday sandinista and uno leaders met with each other with 
carter and other key international observers 
we want to make sure there is a smooth transition of power 
foreign minister miguel descoto said in an interview 
carter said that he representatives of the united nations and 
the organization of american states had agreed to stay and help 
both parties during the transition period 
one of the main points of the transition discussions is the role 
of the army closely identified with the sandinistas and now a 
strong welltrained organization following years of warfare 
the opposition coalition wants to reduce military spending and 
abolish the draft while the sandinistas are opposed to a quick 
drastic reduction 
in managua on monday night several dozen drunken supporters of 
both sides traded insults and clashed briefly in the streets and 
in the provincial capital of leon sandinista activists occupied 
opposition party headquarters for a time but left peacefully 
the managua confrontation developed into a drunken rock and 
bottlethrowing fracas that was broken up by riot police using tear 
gas 
afterward mrs chamorros campaign manager antonio lacayo 
went into the street later told uno supporters i have a message 
from violeta and its that you should go home right now and 
peacefully 
all but a few of the more inebriated celebrants dispersed one 
man was cut in the head during the clash reporters on the scene 
said 
for most international observers it was getaway day and 
senators congressmen and other dignitaries hustled into buses to 
head for the airport 
at the olof palme convention center saddened members of 
international prosandinista groups gathered in front of video 
monitors to watch taped replays of ortegas concession speech in 
the crowd in front of one monitor stood actor ed asner and singer 
jackson browne 
on radio sandino the party station callers expressed anger 
sorrow and determination to continue as a party 
while one caller said ortega shouldnt step down because the 
election was fraudulent most were far more poignant 
daniel daniel we are still with you said one tearful girl 
from the nearby city of masaya the cradle of the sandinista 
revolution 
ortega had called the election and invited the international 
observers that made sundays the freest balloting in nicaraguan 
history and perhaps the most closely monitored anywhere 
after overthrowing dictator anastasio somoza the sandinistas 
transformed the country into a revolutionary state redistributing 
wealth to poor peasants improving the literacy rate and 
nationalizing major industries 
the ortega government won strong support from the soviet union 
and cuba and was accused by the united states of trying to foment a 
communist revolution in neighboring el salvador 
but the embattled sandinistas recently abandoned strident 
socialism and with economic support from the soviet bloc 
decreasing sought closer ties with the united states 
their loss at the polls follows by just a few months the 
restoration of democracy in much of the east bloc and moves toward 
democratization in the soviet union itself

a sheriff who seized a national guard 
armory to ease jail overcrowding is relying in part on a 
300yearold statute that compels others to help him keep the peace 
or face four hours in the stocks 
it sounds funny people laugh about it now county attorney 
edward mcdonough said monday but i think people realize that the 
emergency we faced in 1990 in hampden county was something that was 
unprecedented 
the issue arose feb 16 when sheriff michael ashe seized the 
armory telling surprised guardsmen that lack of jail space posed 
an imminent danger of a breach of the peace 
on friday ashe won the right to keep inmates at the armory 
while county and state officials try to work out a compromise 
location a hearing on the matter was set march 12 
assistant attorney general lawrence fletcherhill argued the 
sheriff is a county official with no authority to take state 
property 
ashe cited a law dating from the massachusetts bay colony that 
allows a sheriff to require assistance in carrying out his duties 
with regard to criminals 
anyone refusing to help if convicted before one or more of 
his majesties justices of the peace such offender or offenders 
shall be fined to the use of the poor of the town where the 
offence shall be committed not exceeding forty shillings at the 
discretion of such justice or justices acording to the 
circumstances aggravating or lessening such offence reads the 
statute in the acts and resolves public and private of the 
province of the massachusetts bay 
those unwilling to come up with the 40 shillings could spend 48 
hours in prison or four hours in the stocks 
mcdonough said in addition to the old statute the county also 
is arguing that the sheriffs duty is to house convicted prisoners 
something his overcrowded jail wouldnt allow

this countrys rightist 
government says it hopes the opposition victory in nicaragua will 
have a ripple effect in el salvador and improve chances of ending a 
leftist insurgency backed by managua 
i believe that now is when the salvadoran democratic process 
should open political spaces for the incorporation of the 
guerrillas and seek social harmony armando calderon sol head of 
the governing nationalist republican alliance party known as 
arena said monday 
in nicaragua violeta barrios de chamorro of the united national 
opposition alliance on sunday defeated president daniel ortega of 
the sandinistas who have ruled since coming to power in a 1979 
revolution and backed the salvadoran rebels 
with the upset of the sandinistas democracy in the region is 
taking hold theres no call to go on killing in el salvador and 
we should facilitate dialogue calderon said 
there was no immediate comment from the rebels fighting the 
rightwing salvadoran government in a 10yearold civil war that 
has claimed 72000 lives 
the government which broke diplomatic and commercial ties with 
nicaragua in november over arms shipments to the rebels 
congratulated mrs chamorro in a statement issued by deputy foreign 
minister ricardo valdivieso 
chamorros triumph opens broad hopes for nicaraguas social 
and economic development process and that of the whole central 
american region valdivieso said 
salvadoran opposition party spokesman ruben zamora also praised 
ortegas government for holding clean and free elections 
the elections are an example of democracy said zamora head 
of the popular social christian movement party and the democratic 
revolutionary front zamoras party and the democratic 
revolutionary front are politically aligned with the farabundo 
marti national liberation front fmln guerrillas 
calderon referring to rumors that nicaragua has sent weapons to 
the salvadoran rebels said the fall of sandinista government means 
the fmln is historically cut off 
col mauricio ernesto vargas military commander in four eastern 
provinces of el salvador said this means the fmln will have to 
change theyre going to lose the suupport they had from nicaragua 
for damaging the political economic and social system in el 
salvador he said 
peace is closer with the change in nicaragua vargas said in 
a telephone interview with the associated press

the opposition called today 
for the suspension of the defense minister while the government 
investigates charges a secret military unit murdered antiapartheid 
activists 
the democratic party said gen magnus malan must be suspended 
until a probe into the militarys civil cooperation bureau is 
concluded justice would almost certainly be obstructed if malan 
remains in power during the investigation the liberal party said 
in a statement 
the black reaction is going to be one of anger because blacks 
see this as a case of government manipulating the truth party 
coleader denis worrall said 
malan defense mnister since 1981 has denied ordering any 
killings or other criminal activity there have been more than 60 
unsolved killings of antiapartheid activists in the past decade 
in other developments police said today that two black men were 
killed in continued fighting between rival black factions near 
durban in natal province 
scores of people have been killed in recent weeks in fighting in 
the province and black leader nelson mandela released this month 
after 27 years in prison appealed for peace at a rally in natal on 
sunday 
police said violence was nevertheless continuing in the 
province with 18 people killed in clashes in the past three days 
they said about 200 people had been left homeless after scores 
of homes were burned in black townships near durban in the fighting 
between the united democratic front and the more conservative 
inkatha movement of the zulu tribe 
also today lawyers representing more than 300 political 
prisoners on robben island near cape town said their clients would 
stay on a hunger strike until the government releases them the 
prisoners who began the strike monday are protesting a government 
decision not to release political prisoners convicted of violent 
crimes 
they want to be unconditionally released they are extremely 
unhappy lawyer willie hofmeyr told a news conference in cape 
town 
president fw de klerk released some political prisoners 
earlier this month as part of his effort to try and clear the way 
for talks on ending white rule and sharing power with the black 
majority 
de klerk has refused to release hundreds of antiapartheid 
activists convicted of violent offenses 
the incoming black goverment in neighboring namibia a former 
south african territory becoming independent at months end 
denounced malan today for claiming a slain white activist was an 
agent of south africas military 
theoben gurirab the new foreign minister said malans 
statement about anton lubowski was tantamount to an act of 
cowardice to make these kind of allegations which cannot be 
rebutted by anton lubowski 
malan told parliament in cape town on monday that all activities 
of the civilian cooperation bureau were being suspended pending a 
government probe into charges it was involved in political killings 
malan also claimed lubowski a leading figure in the southwest 
african peoples organization swapo that fought a 23bush war for 
namibian independence was a south african intelligence operative 
south african police brig floris mostert has alleged in court 
documents that he suspects the bureau was involved in the sept 12

a woman cancer patient who refused 
chemical and radiation treatment because she was pregnant 
delivered an apparently healthy baby and now plans to beat the odds 
again with her own diet program 
i believe i dont have cancer any more linda babcock said 
monday from her bed at st joseph medical center in this central 
illinois city 
i feel so much better i can breathe i could tell it was 
there before it felt like something cutting off my air taking my 
life she said 
mrs babcock gave birth friday to a 5pound 6ounce boy jesse 
warren babcock 
she has defied the statistics so far and provided a very 
viable child her physician dr larry webster said monday night 
basically the cancer stayed pretty much the same since last 
summer webster said thats good 
diagnosed in august with a type of inoperable lung cancer called 
oat cell carcinoma mrs babcock lived on a diet of carrot juice 
organically grown vegetables and fruits lots of purified water and 
vitamin pills 
she also relied on her strong faith in god she said 
give god the credit said mrs babcock who described 
herself as in the 30s he guided me through people i met books 
i read 
statistically her condition is certainly guarded said 
webster the cancer is very malignant and carries a very low 
survivability rate 
although xrays show the tumor and fluid caused by the disease 
remain in her right lung the possibility exists the disease is in 
remission he said 
you certainly would have to think so on the history of the 
disease in other people normally at the stage it was in her it 
would be fatal 
webster said he will not try to talk her into a more traditional 
therapy 
we mention chemotherapy and radiation to her but thats her 
choice he said id have to say that i would leave it up to 
her 
im confident of living of beating the cancer mrs babcock 
said the baby saved me from death as i saved him

parade floats and scantily clad 
samba dancers revved up the citys marathon carnival while the 
government urged tv stations to be a bit more discreet about 
broadcasting nude revelers 
justice minister saulo ramos asked tv executives monday not to 
broadcast flagrant examples of nudity but the more prevailing 
attitude was expressed by roberto costa an advertising agency 
employee in belo horizonte 
this helps us forget inflation the foreign debt and all of 
brazils problems said costa who wore a glistening purple wig 
and was dancing in the fourday prelent festivities 
in rio unofficial capital of carnival 16 samba schools 
neighborhood groups from poor predominantly black districts take 
part in the marathon twonight parade that ends today the last day 
of carnival 
the schools each with as many as 5000 costumed members and up 
to 20 floats sing and dance to a boneshaking beat in the 
sambadrome a parade ground surrounded by a 75000seat 
grandstand that covers six city blocks in downtown rio 
dancers clad in rhinestone bikinis shimmy and gyrate to the 
pulsing beat two television networks carry the parade live 
focusing on nudity and rolling pelvises 
in brasilia justice minister ramos noted that the 1988 
constitution abolished censorship but asked broadcasters to use 
selfrestraint 
censorship has ended and we dont have a law that punishes 
abuses he said we appeal to the conscience of the networks to 
respect the ethical values of the brazilian family 
revelers with money packed the popular privateclub balls where 
clothing and inhibitions are shed as the night goes on the steamy 
scenes are too much even for the television networks which stop 
live coverage in the wee hours 
rich and poor packed the sambadrome sidebyside monay singing 
along as each group passed when the popular portela school went by 
at 7 am thousands of spectators climbed down from the 
grandstands and joined the procession 
the only somber note came when a float struck a highvoltage 
wire outside the parade ground and a man was killed 
each school writes its own samba for the parade and is awarded 
points for lyrics costumes dancing and music the themes this 
year ranged from the discovery of brazil to last decembers 
election the first free popular election of a president in 29 
years 
this year also brought a revival of street carnival in rio with 
pickup samba bands and improvised costumes in the downtown 
financial district a beermobile passed out free suds

contralto marian andersons 1939 washington concert a civil rights 
landmark inspires record numbers of blacks to turn out in this 
years census

lincoln memorial urging blacks to lift up your voice stand up 
for who you are answer the census on april 1 1990

19 percent of the 39 million populace each black then was counted 
as only threefifths of a person she said

opposition sen juan ponce enrile 
surrendered to police after he and six others were indicted today 
on rebellion charges for alleged roles in decembers failed bid to 
oust president corazon aquino 
the former defense minister one of mrs aquinos most vocal 
critics has denied any role in the bloody dec 19 coup attempt 
and accused the government of fabricating charges to silence the 
opposition 
enrile left the senate chamber with agents of the national 
bureau of investigation who served him an arrest warrant charging 
him harboring fugitives and with rebellion with murder for 
which there is normally no bail 
he was taken to bureau headquarters where he was booked and 
fingerprinted enrile told reporters he would probably remain there 
overnight then ask the supreme court to allow bail 
before surrendering enrile said i know that those who are 
accusing me will surely have their day as i have my day today 
the others indicted today were former lt col gregorio 
gringo honasan cagayan provincial gov rodolfo aguinaldo 
retired brig gen felix brawner retired lt col billy bibit 
businessman rebecco panlilio and his wife 
enrile was the most wellknown figure charged so far in the 
failed coup the sixth and bloodiest attempt to unseat mrs aquino 
since she took office in the 1986 uprising that toppled the late 
president ferdinand marcos 
enrile led the february 1986 military mutiny that triggered the 
people power uprising mrs aquino rode to power but mrs 
aquino fired enrile as defense minister in november of that year 
after a failed coup by his followers 
charges against enrile stem from statements by witnesses who 
claimed they saw honasan and about 100 rebels at the senators home 
on the first day of the coup attempt enrile claims he has not seen 
honasan since 1987 
hours after his indictment was announced enrile appeared at the 
senate and in a speech to his colleagues said the regime of 
president corazon c aquino has marshaled all its forces in 
fabricating charges against me in order to silence the voice of the 
opposition in this chamber 
as i leave you today i pledge to you that no jail or prison 
shall stop me from trying my best to voice the grievances of the 
filipino people he added supporters of the failed coup have 
charged the aquino goverment with mismanagement and corruption 
vice president salvador laurel arrived later at the bureau 
headquarters and told reporters that if enriles arrest was an 
attempt to stifle the opposition this is not going to work 
the arrest of sen juan ponce enrile the lone opposition 
member of the senate is the heighth of intolerance of political 
dissent which is the essence of a functioning democracy laurel 
said the attempt to simulate compliance with legal processes 
merely heightens the hypocrisy of the act 
laurel broke with mrs aquino in 1987 and later organized the 
opposition nacionalista party along with enrile 
in a speech sunday marking her fourth anniversary in office 
mrs aquino repeatedly denounced enrile who as marcos defense 
minister ordered the arrest of thousands including her 
assassinated husband benigno jr during martial law from 1972 
until 1981 
she thanked the public for protecting her from him 
aguinaldo a former lieutenant colonel was suspended as 
governor for 60 days after telling a manila radio station that he 
was sending tanks and artillery to the capital to support the coup 
attempt 
honasan who has been dropped from the military rolls led the 
august 1987 mutiny against mrs aquino and played a leading role in 
last decembers putsch he was arrested in december 1987 but 
escaped the following april 
brawner former military commander for northern luzon had been 
serving as a consultant to the senate defense committee after he 
retired from the armed forces last year he was accused of giving 
advice to the rebels during the coup attempt 
bibit the security chief of the customs bureau was accused of 
ransacking the customs armory to get weapons and food for the 
mutineers he was arrested last month 
panlilio and his wife were reportedly seen at enriles house 
with honasan on the first day of the decmeber coup attempt

japan said today it welcomed nicaraguas first free 
elections and offered to help the country rebuild its shattered 
economy 
the foreign ministry did not say how much money japan was 
prepared to spend but said it is determined to make as much 
contribution as possible in this regard 
a ministry statement said japan hopes all factions in nicaragua 
will accept the results of sundays election in which opposition 
leader violeta barrios de chamorro defeated sandinista president 
daniel ortega 
the statement said it hopes nicaraguas new president who takes 
office april 25 will work for democratization and improved living 
standards 
ten years of sandinista rule in nicaragua has left an economy 
wracked by inflation and mismanagement a war with the usbacked 
contra rebels and a us embargo also took their toll 
the ministry statement said it hopes the international community 
will join in rehabilitating the economy of nicaragua and the 
other countries in the region and solving refugee problems

thousands of nicaraguan exiles clogged 
the main street of the community nicknamed little managua to 
celebrate the upset defeat of their homelands sandinista regime 
proclaiming miracles do happen 
but their jubilation was tempered by concern about how victor 
violeta barrios de chamorra will cope with daunting problems facing 
nicaragua 
police estimated 8000 nicaraguans and other hispanics converged 
monday on sweetwater a town west of miami that is home to southern 
floridas largest nicaraguan community after the defeat of 
president daniel ortega in nicaraguas national elections 
we never dreamed about it said an exultant francisco 
ortega president of the nicaraguan american chamber of commerce in 
dade county we thought it was impossible but see miracles do 
happen 
nicaraguan exiles many of whom had not slept since voting began 
sunday morning jammed busy flagler street some waved flags 
danced and sang patriotic songs others sat in cars and blared 
horns 
the crowd swelled in the evening as the work day ended and 
police closed a fiveblock stretch to traffic 
while many exiles talked of returning to nicaragua they said 
they wanted to see the new usbacked government in action first 
democracy is on its way back said inez de gutierrez a 
31yearold grocery store cashier who has been in the united states 
for a year with her husband and young daughter but she said she 
would not return immediately 
well just wait a while and see how things go in nicaragua 
politically and economically the country is in ruins its in 
great poverty now 
renato salazar said he will not be ready to return until the 
sandinistas the leftwing revolutionaries who took power in 1979 
relinquish control of the military and police 
democracy means total democracy not the government being in 
charge of one part and the opposition in control of the army he 
said 
at a shelter for central americans near the border city of 
brownsville texas edgar toruno raudales expressed the same 
reservations 
what good is it to have violeta in power if the army controls 
the country he said there could be a coup at any time 
this is what all the nicaraguans wanted the victory of 
violeta said jose alfredo velasquez 
but rosaria baldeoceda a 23yearold student from managua was 
more skeptical no matter who is selected we will have the same 
mess she said at the shelter in texas 
more than 100000 nicaraguans have settled in southern florida 
since the sandinista revolution and sweetwater mayor jose a 
rivero said many of them may have to return because they lack 
permanent status in the united states 
adolfo calero former director of the usbacked contra rebels 
who fought the sandinistas predicted that slowly the nicaraguan 
exiles will go back to the country 
im going back as soon as i get a passport from the country 
calero said i think the armed struggle is over the armed 
struggle was never an end in itself it was always a means to force 
the sandinistas into a political contest which the people won 
headed by violeta chamorro 
luis munoz who joined in the celebration said he hoped the 
government also changes in his homeland of cuba which he left as a 
teenager 
i know its going to happen one of these days said the 
27yearold he said he wanted to return to cuba because i belong 
there

a group of vietnamese boat people returned 
voluntarily to their communist homeland today the 12th group to do 
so since the program began early last year 
the group of 115 vietnamese brought to 1284 the number who have 
returned under the un program nearly 1600 more have asked to 
leave the overcrowded detention centers of hong kong and go home 
about 44000 vietnamese have arrived in this british colony 
since june 1988 when the government decided to classify arriving 
boat people as illegal immigrants unless they can prove they fled 
persecution 
only about 10 percent will be granted refugee status the rest 
face repatriation against their will unless they volunteer to go 
home 
the united nations provides vietnamese who return voluntarily 
with up to 50 in cash and a monthly allowance of 30 for one year 
the voluntary repatriation program is expected to speed up now 
that hanoi has agreed to accept 1000 returning boat people each 
month 
the repatriation of boat people against their will remains on 
hold after an initial departure of 51 vietnamese in december hanoi 
has expressed reservations about the program because of criticism 
from the united states and human rights organizations

orders to us factories for durable goods 
plunged 105 percent in january the biggest decline since orders 
first were tracked 32 years ago the government reported today a 
drop in aircraft orders led the way 
the commerce department said orders for durable goods 
bigticket items expected to last more than three years totaled a 
seasonally adjusted 1182 billion last month after increasing a 
revised 14 percent in december that figure originally was 
reported to be up 25 percent 
the steepest decline until januarys record was a 92 percent 
fall in february 1982 
most of the decline was in transportation equipment the 
department said aircraft and parts which had been unusually 
high in the last several months accounted for nearly half of the 
january decline in transportation although motor vehicles and 
parts and shipbuilding and tanks were both down sharply 
aircraft orders represented onethird of the overall decline 
auto production also fell in january as tens of thousands of auto 
workers were laid off to help the industry shrink swollen 
inventories the department considers car orders and production to 
be the same 
the drop helped pull overall transportation orders down 276 
percent to 279 billion 
much of the economys recent weakness has been concentrated in 
durable goods as the federal reserve sought for more than a year to 
drive down inflation by keeping a tight rein on credit the result 
has been higher interest rates which adversely affect durable 
goods orders because they often are financed by loans 
excluding the transportation industry orders fell 34 percent 
the closely watched nondefense capital goods sector often a 
barometer of business investment plans fell 137 percent 
reversing decembers 142 percent gain the sector also posted 
gains in october and november 
electrical machinery orders dropped 176 percent to 188 
billion after rising 56 percent in december and 73 percent in 
november virtually all of the decrease was in communications 
equipment the commerce department said 
orders for nonelectrical machinery including computers and a 
wide variety of industrial equipment rose 26 percent to 223 
billion after falling 39 percent in december 
primary metals orders were up 15 percent to 111 billion 
following a 28 percent decline in december 
new orders for defense capital goods a highly volatile sector 
plummeted 36 percent to 63 billion for the lowest onemonth 
volume of orders since january 1987 defense orders had slipped 
129 percent in december after rising 177 percent in november 
excluding defense orders would have been off 34 percent 
shipments of durable goods in january dropped 37 percent to 
1177 billion after falling 08 percent a month earlier

tenants in a luxury apartment building who waged 
a rent strike over balky elevators and cockroaches may have a 
bigger problem authorities say their leader has disappeared along 
with 17 million of their money 
a warrant is out for the arrest of steven nelson delit 45 an 
accountant and president of the tenants association at the 
45story tintedglass apartment building on the fashionable east 
side of manhattan 
delit used money from the account to pay his rent and gambling 
debts manhattan district attorney robert morgenthau said monday a 
pizza parlor he owns also may have been bought with the money the 
prosecutor said 
delit organized a rent strike among some of the tenants who 
while paying rents of 1750 to 5000 a month complained of 
problems with the buildings elevators and airconditioning 
cockroach infestations and water leaks 
when you live in a building and you pay 100 percent rent you 
expect 100 percent services he said two years ago 
the tenants won a court order in september 1988 allowing them to 
pay rents into an bank escrow account set up by delit instead of 
to the landlord until the buildings alleged problems were fixed 
but the escrow account never was opened investigators now say 
the money paid by 40 to 60 tenants was deposited instead into an 
account over which delit had sole authority 
morgenthau said the tenants probably still have to pay the 27 
months of rent the bill could reach tens of thousands of dollars 
for some tenants 
delit has been charged with firstdegree grand larceny on 
charges of stealing 171 million morgenthau said if convicted 
he faces up to 25 years in prison 
he left 213000 in the account which held more than 19 
million morgenthau said an additional 573000 has been found in 
a brokerage account and 400000 has been frozen in other 
accounts morgenthau said 
dominick franklin a doorman at the building did have something 
nice to say about delit as a tipper he was one of the best 
franklin said

blacks disrupted a city council meeting and 
forced a recess after the whitemajority council voted 54 along 
racial lines not to repave martin luther king jr street 
councilman lorenzo harrison asked council to spend 17000 to 
pave the street in his district for this weekends 25th anniversary 
celebration of the 1965 selmatomontgomery voting rights march 
councilman bill king said repaving the street would be a 
conciliatory gesture by the white councilmen to the black 
community weve spent millions of dollars illogically so we 
might as well spend 17000 on this he said 
white councilman argued that other streets in the city were in 
worse shape 
at monday nights meeting some of the blacks in the audience 
exchanged words with city leaders including mayor joe smitherman 
telling them to shut up and sit down 
council president carl morgan ordered a recess because he said 
the crowd became too unruly for the council to conduct business 
the city has been the scene of racial turmoil since december 
when the six whites on the 11member school board voted against 
renewing the contract of norward roussell the citys first black 
school superintendent 
demonstrators staged sitins at the high school and city hall 
before the school board agreed to allow the superintendent to 
remain in his job until his contract expires in june

the victory of violeta chamorro in nicaragua 
adds a new country to the world lineup of democracies but also 
adds to the us dilemma as it tries to squeeze more eligible 
nations into a limited foreign aid budget 
nobody said democracy was cheap said rep dante fascell 
dfla chairman of the house foreign affairs committee 
fascell declined to say how much the united states must spend to 
get mrs chamorros new government to take office in april a 
running start despite an economy in shambles and a shaky political 
coalition 
but rep stephen solarz dny said the united states should 
contribute up to 300 million to an international fund that would 
raise 1 billion to help restore the nations economic health 
it will take big bucks agreed senate minority leader bob 
dole rkan she needs our help and she deserves it 
others cautioned however that with a growing line of potential 
new foreign aid recipients poland hungary czechoslovakia 
panama and others it would be difficult to promise new money when 
the budget already is falling short 
rep mickey edwards rokla said his reaction to the news of 
chamorros win over leftist sandinista president daniel ortega was 
astonishment its happening from one end of the world to the 
other the tyrants are being swept out 
but any euphoria was dampened by financial reality he said no 
attempt to pour more money into foreign aid will find many 
supporters because voters tend to see it as building roads over 
there instead of building roads here edwards said 
its not realistic to expect the result of all this is going 
to be a tripling of foreign aid he said the american people 
arent going to support it 
this year the united states will send about 98 billion in 
military economic and development aid to several dozen friendly 
countries around the globe the lions share 51 billion goes to 
israel and egypt as a reward for entering into the camp david peace 
process the bush administration has asked for a slight increase 
to 101 billion for 1991 
those amounts do not include a new threeyear assistance program 
approved last year for poland and hungary lawmakers already are 
talking about adding more money to that program to include 
countries like czechoslovakia east germany and romania 
in addition president bush is asking congress for 500 million 
in new cash to help repair economic damage done to panama by us 
trade sanctions and physical damage done by decembers invasion 
the aid squeeze prompted one us foreign aid official to joke 
that he was a closet sandinista because a chamorro win would 
put even greater strains on the aid program 
solarz and others mostly democrats believe the money for new 
democracies should be taken out of the defense departments 300 
billion annual budget reasoning that in a time of diminishing 
communist threat it would be better spent to shore up potential new 
allies 
dole took a different approach using chamorros win over ortega 
to renew his proposal to alter the nations foreign aid priorities 
beginning with the two largest recipients israel and egypt 
the only way were going to pay for new aid to nicaragua 
panama czechoslovakia is to look to the foreign aid budget that 
now exists and make some tough calls he said in a senate floor 
speech 
dole so far has found few supporters for his idea and house 
speaker thomas s foley cautioned that nicaragua should not 
automatically be given priority over current recipients of us 
aid foley singled out jamaica a country that saw its 1990 overall 
aid check cut from 46 million to 19 million despite close 
cooperation in the us war on drugs 
but the consensus was that the money will have to be found 
somewhere 
we spent a great deal of money on military aid to the 
antisandinista contra rebels foley said we now should support 
democracy we need to understand that the united states should 
not be withdrawing from international affairs

senate and white house negotiators moved 
closer to accord on a clean air bill today but majority leader 
george mitchell says senate floor debate will begin later this week 
whether an agreement is reached or not 
we are making progress mitchell said as closeddoor 
discussions resumed monday and continued past midnight but he 
added we started the talks three weeks ago and at some point we 
need to reach a conclusion 
the talks in a crowded room adjacent to mitchells office in the 
capitol did not break until past 3 am with no overall agreement 
reached discussions were to resume today according to senate 
sources 
sources close to the talks said early today that democrats and 
the bush adminstration agreed on tougher controls on toxic 
chemicals and smogcausing pollutants from industrial plants but 
remained divided on acid rain curbs 
the talks also moved closer to agreement on reducing automobile 
emissions with the bush administration for the first time agreeing 
to a second round of tougher emission controls after the turn of 
the century under some circumstances 
the two sides agreed a socalled second stage of tailpipe 
controls would go into effect nationwide if a certain number of 
cities with the worst smog problems failed to achieve federal air 
quality standards by a specific year according to sources 
the white house had argued earlier that a second round of auto 
emission controls would be too expensive 
mitchell met monday with white house chief of staff john sununu 
and william reilly head of the environmental protection agency 
sununu agreed progress was being made but he expressed concern 
that bringing the measure to the senate floor without agreement 
with the administration might threaten key parts of the bill 
including the tough provisions on acid rain 
the legislation would be the first revision of the federal clean 
air law in 13 years it would require tougher controls on acid rain 
pollutants from electric power plants curbs on toxic chemical 
releases by industry and reductions in smogcausing emissions from 
automobiles 
among the sticking points were how to ease some of the concerns 
especially from a group of midwest senators over controls of acid 
rain pollutants from coalfired electric power plants 
mitchell who has made the clean air bill one of his top 
priorities told participants he intends to bring the measure to 
the senate floor thursday whether or not there was an agreement 
with the white house 
the senate bill and administration proposals agree on a call for 
cutting sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons a year by the 
end of the decade 
more than a dozen senators primarily from the midwest have 
threatened to filibuster unless some sort of costsharing provision 
is included to blunt the expenses many midwest utilities will face 
from having to install new acid rain control equipment 
mitchell bristled at sununus suggestion that bringing the 
measure to the senate floor might cause it to be weakened 
it is the administration that has insisted on changing the 
bill mitchell said every single weakening concession that 
has been made has been made at the insistence of the 
administration every single one

a shuttle in orbit is a rugged 
durable spaceship but a shuttle on the ground is a weather wimp 
that demands clear dry mild and still air before leaving its 
florida nest 
when nasa abandoned an attempt to launch atlantis early monday 
it marked the 13th time in 34 missions that space shuttles had to 
stay home because of weather the failed attempt monday was the 
fifth postponement in five days for atlantis weather was a factor 
in all but one case 
weather played a role too in the worst us space disaster 
the challenger explosion on jan 28 1986 that killed seven 
astronauts 
the shuttle is finicky about the weather because it has to be 
weather forces that might be only minor problems for 
conventional aircraft can tear the shuttle apart 
winds as light as 23 mph just a spirited breeze for a sailboat 
can smash a shuttle against its launch tower during takeoff this 
was one of the weather threats that blocked mondays attempt to 
launch atlantis 
bumpy air aloft that might cause an airline pilot to turn on the 
seatbelt sign can be enough to tear off the wing of a shuttle 
rising through the atmosphere at three times the speed of sound 
highaltitude winds of about 100 mph from the wrong direction 
can threaten the shuttle but would be nothing of significance for 
an airliner 
clouds that are only mildly annoying to even small planes can be 
killers for the shuttle 
because the spacecraft returns to earth as a powerless glider 
astronauts on the shuttle have only one chance to make a runway 
landing thus even before the shuttle is launched the national 
aeronautics and space administration has to make sure clouds dont 
obscure the visibility at emergency landing sites 
this was another of the problems that stopped atlantis launch 
monday a bank of clouds at 5000 feet blocked a clear shot at the 
kennedy space center emergency landing strip 
space shuttles are also supersensitive to water raindrops that 
patter meekly against the window of a house become like buckshot 
against a shuttle traveling at hyperspeeds thus any precipitation 
at the launch pad or in the flight path is enough to keep the craft 
grounded 
even the mild temperatures of florida can stop the shuttles 
show if temperatures average less than 41 degrees for 24 hours 
before a launch nasa must wait for warmer weather 
once the shuttle fuel tank is filled with a halfmillion gallons 
of propellant a temperature rise above 99 degrees or a drop below 
37 is enough to call off a launch 
challenger was exposed to hours of freezing temperatures before 
its illfated launch in 1986 an investigation said the cold caused 
the failure of a rubber oring in a solid rocket joint 
the shuttles finickyweather rules fill a thick volume and are 
enforced by an army of forecasters and observers who monitor every 
gust of wind and drop of rain for miles around the launch pad and 
the emergency landing sites 
nasa tries again to launch atlantis on wednesday and 
forecasters said today that prospects for good weather by that time 
were looking up on monday they pegged the odds that the weather 
would be acceptable at 40 percent this morning that figure rose 
to 60 percent

farmers from delaware to georgia fretted as winter returned 
after weeks of unusually warm weather that had peach and apple 
trees blooming early but experts said the damage from the cold 
would probably be limited 
temperatures moderated today after mondays severe cold attack 
with atlanta dipping only to 32 degrees and macon ga hitting a 
low of 33 but while the mass of cold air was sliding slowly out to 
sea it held on in the northeast where windor locks conn hit a 
record low of 2 below zero 
experts said crops throughout the middle atlantic region 
appeared to have been spared serious damage so far since cold moved 
back in sunday and monday 
some of the peach trees were in full bloom and some had just 
turned pink jim olson of the north carolina department of 
agriculture said monday they growers are concerned but it was 
not as bad as they had anticipated 
although temperatures plummeted to near freezing and below 
throughout the state they did not drop as low as earlier 
predicted georgia agriculture commissioner tommy irvin said 
we were certainly fortunate to have survived without significant 
damage to our peach wheat and vidalia onion crops 
temperatures dipped into the teens in the carolinas and as low 
as 10 in delaware early monday but peach and apple growers said no 
severe damage was apparent 
at this stage in their growth it would have had to have 
dropped to 7 degrees to really hurt said charles smith coowner 
of ts smith amp sons in bridgeville del we might have had some 
damage but we cant tell much i dont think it was disastrous 
smith said growers are concerned about temperatures in the next 
few weeks because the unusual warm spell during much of january and 
february when temperatures often reached into the 60s had fruit 
trees blooming three weeks earlier than normal 
kitty washburne president of a mailorder flowering bulb 
business in garrison md saw a good side to the chill it 
reminded spring bulbs that its only february 
my immediate reaction was that i was kind of glad that we had 
something to stop them a little bit in their zeal to come up she 
said

people held against their will at state mental 
hospitals without receiving legally required hearings may sue 
officials in federal court for monetary damages the supreme court 
ruled by a 54 vote today 
the justices reversing lower court rulings said a florida man 
may sue in federal court over being held in a florida state 
hospital for five months without a hearing that state law requires 
within 48 hours 
writing for the court justice harry a blackmun said people 
raising such claims are not limited to suing for damages in state 
courts 
darrell burch was found wandering along a florida highway dec 
7 1981 he was taken to a tallahassee community health services 
center where he was held for three days 
during that time burch was hallucinating he believed he was in 
heaven 
after his stay at the center burch was transferred to the 
florida state hospital where he remained until may 7 1982 his 
lawsuit alleges that he was heavily medicated and disoriented when 
arriving at the state hospital 
despite a state law that entitled him to a hearing within 48 
hours of his admission to challenge his detention and treatment 
burch did not receive a hearing 
his federal lawsuit alleged that 11 officials and employees of 
the florida state hospital acted with willful wanton and 
reckless disregard of and indifference to his dueprocess rights 
the suit invoked a muchused civil rights law 
a federal judge threw out the suit ruling that burch was barred 
from filing it because he could win adequate relief in state court 
a threejudge panel of the 11th us circuit court of appeals 
upheld the dismissal but the entire appeals court voted 85 to 
reinstate the suit 
todays decision upheld the 11th circuit courts ruling and 
burchs lawsuit can now proceed 
blackmun wrote that previous high court decisions limiting 
access to federal courts if adequate state court remedies exist do 
not apply to burchs case because the deprivation of burchs 
liberty was not unpredictable 
under floridas statutory scheme only a person competent to 
give informed consent may be admitted as a voluntary patient 
blackmun said there is however no specified way of 
determining before a patient is asked to sign admission forms 
whether he is competent 
therefore blackmun said it is hardly unforeseeable that a 
person requesting treatment for mental illness might be incapable 
of informed consent and that state officials with the power to 
admit patients might take their apparent willingness to be admitted 
at face value 
blackmun was joined by justices william j brennan byron r 
white thurgood marshall and john paul stevens 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices sandra day 
oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy dissented 
the case is zinermon vs burch 871965

czechoslovak president vaclav havel today paid 
homage to the late human rights activist andrei sakharov one of 
the few soviets who openly welcomed the 1968 prague spring 
reforms and denounced the sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia

also met with soviet legislators and suggested an exchange of 
parliamentary delegations with the czechoslovak side led by 
alexander dubcek the former communist party chief who authored the 
1968 reforms 
dubceks last two official visits to moscow were humiliating in 
the first days after the sovietled warsaw pact invasion he was 
under arrest in the second two months later he signed an 
agreement allowing soviet troops to stay on czechoslovak soil 
indefinitely and promising the country would return to 
sovietstyle hardline rule 
dubcek was ousted as party chief in 1969 and returned to a 
position of power only late last year as head of parliament 
following that countrys peaceful revolution 
in sharp contrast to dubceks experience havel met with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev monday and announced an accord to 
withdraw the 73500 soviet troops from czechoslovakia by july 1 
1991 
we perfectly understood each other on various problems 
havel in an interview with soviet television 
he also agreed to help pay for the soviet troops to leave his 
country provide free transport back home and help build housing 
for the troops in the soviet union 
sakharov who died in december became a fierce campaigner for 
human rights and reform after the prague spring reforms were 
crushed by soviet troops he lived to see the soviet government 
condemn its invasion but he did not see the election of havel a 
former political prisoner as czechoslovak president 
havel visited the grave with sakharovs widow yelena bonner 
and czechoslovak foreign minister jiri dienstbier they placed 
flowers among the many bouquets which are constantly replenished by 
mourners 
the czechoslovak leader also met today with members of the 
soviet parliaments foreign affairs committee then walked across 
red square to his car surrounded by security guards 
havel and the legislators discussed the parliaments of the two 
countries and future exchanges soviet foreign ministry spokesman 
gennady gerasimov said 
havel arrived in moscow for talks with gorbachev on monday just 
three days after returning from the united states where he met 
with president bush 
at a news conference monday havel said he signed a joint 
declaration with gorbachev that opens the way for new cooperation 
between the two countries it suggested relations be developed on 
the basis of equality and complete mutual respect for each others 
state sovereignty according to tass 
the czechovslovak delegation included defense minister miroslav 
vacek and interior minister richard sacher who wants to reduce 
links between officials of his ministry and those of the soviet kgb 
operating on czechoslovak soil 
havel a playwright spent five years in prison for his 
political activities against the czechoslovak government

today as he set foot on foreign soil for the first time in 28 years 
the black nationalist leader embraced exiled members of his 
african national congress and seven african presidents in an 
emotional ceremony on the tarmac at the lusaka airport 
president kenneth kaunda of zambia whose southern african 
nation has hosted the ancs exile headquarters for almost two 
decades was the first to greet mandela and his wife winnie 
to drumbeats mandela was draped with garlands of red and white 
flowers by the children of anc exiles dozens of young anc 
guerrillas wearing black berets anc tshirts and military fatigues 
looked on 
in his sixday visit mandela will meet african and commonwealth 
leaders as well as with exiled anc leaders from the organizations 
35member national executive committee and military wing no agenda 
for the anc meetings has been released but officials indicated anc 
strategy and mandelas role within the group would be discussed 
zambian officials said the talks with regional leaders will have 
the most impact on political life in southern africa since the 1979 
lusaka commonwealth summit that meeting cleared the way for the 
end of white minority rule in the former british colony of 
rhodesia now independent zimbabwe 
about 10000 people including many south african exiles 
cheered waving the ancs distinctive black green and gold colors 
when mandela left the plane and raised a clenchedfist salute 
he told the crowd he was happy to be visiting the second home of 
exiled anc leaders who molded the organization into a powerful 
political and military force 
they have led and directed our people to the point where we 
are on the verge of a breathrough in our struggle for freedom 
mandela said 
he praised kaunda as a peacemaker who tried to persuade 
successive governments in pretoria to open dialogue with the anc 
but if we are compelled to resort to armsthe responsibility 
for this lies firmly on the shoulders of the government he said 
tens of thousands of wellwishers exhorted by fullpage 
advertisements in government newspapers lined the 15mile route 
from lusaka airport to kuandas official residence where mandela 
will stay 
people waited in sweltering tropical temperatures for several 
hours to catch a glimpse of the anc leader who was released from 
prison in south africa on feb 11 
the crowds waved green branches a traditional african symbol of 
rejoicing in the biggest public turnout since pope john paul iis 
visit last may 
kaunda declared today a national holiday and nelson mandela day

million city authorities temporarily lifted a ban on public 
gatherings imposed last month to curb an outbreak of cholera that 
has killed more than 80 people

south africa was taken by a highspeed motorcade of limousines to 
lusakas main conference complex where he was to meet visiting 
foreign dignitaries 
during his stay in zambia mandela will meet with leaders from 
angola botswana mozambique tanzania zambia and zimbabwe as 
well as from the 49nation commonwealth of former british 
territories 
we will obviously be examining how to proceed with the 
political struggle and the armed struggle a senior anc official 
said on condition of anonymity 
he said the meeting will also select a 10member anc delegation 
for preliminary talks with south african president fw de klerk 
the talks will clear the way for negotiations on full participation 
in south africa by the 28 million disenfranchised blacks 
the anc says reforms announced by de klerk including the 
lifting of a 30year ban on the anc on feb 2 and mandelas 
release do not go far enough but on feb 16 the group said it 
was willing to hold its first direct talks with pretoria

after he formed a black congregation received applause at a jesuit 
college when he condemned the church as racist and ordered guards 
to throw out a heckler 
the rev george stallings who was excommunicated after forming 
the africanamerican catholic congregation in washington dc 
last summer addressed an audience of about 1300 people monday at 
le moyne college 
he was applauded when he said the catholic church remains 
primarily a white racist institution in the united states and 
that he would both expose the racism of the church and provide an 
alternative 
but stallings received some opposition when he strayed from the 
issue of racism 
stallings who claims a following of about 2200 people began 
listing his congregations support for birth control female 
priests married priests and permission for catholic couples to 
divorce 
what right do they church leaders have to say that i 
should not have the right to break that relationship and move into 
a wholesome healthy and protective relationship stallings asked 
a man in the audience yelled jesus said it and began moving 
toward stallings thats who said it 
stallings quickly surrounded by guards and supporters ordered 
guards to throw the man out 
i am the one who is giving the lecture sir not you he 
said get him out and put him out 
two other dissenters stood outside of the building with posters 
protesting abortion and stallings appearance stallings does not 
support catholic church opposition to abortion saying he supports 
free choice in the matter 
stallings said his church will allow priests to marry but he 
said he wouldnt marry a nun as some expriests have 
when i get married it wont be to a nun i can tell you

a determined mikhail s gorbachev today pushed 
through the legislature his proposal for a westernstyle presidency 
despite vigorous objections that the new post would concentrate too 
much power in one mans hands 
amid shouts of protest from lawmakers who warned of the dangers 
of dictatorship gorbachev called the vote for his proposal a 
great political event in the history of our state 
the vote in the supreme soviet was 34724 with 43 abstentions 
in favor of the bill that approves creation of the presidency in 
principle the bill now goes to committees who will consider 
numerous amendments proposed during a day of heated debate 
then the congress of peoples deputies the supreme soviets 
parent body will meet march 1213 to elect a president 
the bill would give the president sweeping powers to declare 
war veto legislation impose a state of emergency and call a 
referendum on legislative decisions he doesnt approve of 
during the debate today liberals said the creation of a 
presidency is premature and they accused the leadership of trying 
to rush the issue through 
but gorbachev angrily rejected critics saying they had engaged 
in cheap demagoguery legislators shouted in protest from the 
floor 
everything i believe necessary to say ill say the 
58yearold kremlin chief shouted back 
one legislator a taxi driver from the ukraine who last year 
compared gorbachev to napoleon on national television said he saw 
a bad omen in the voting 
the way the voting went from the floor today is the same way 
presidential power will be shouted leonid sukhov in an obvious 
reference to gorbachevs pressure 
prodemocracy demonstrators in several soviet cities over the 
weekend said the president would become a dictator and one sign at 
a leningrad rally warned the new post could lead to fascism 
the supreme soviet refused feb 14 to be stampeded into setting 
a timetable for approving a presidency modeled after the american 
and french systems 
gorbachev has said a strong president is needed as part of his 
blueprint for transferring power from the communist party to the 
government it is a radical departure from soviet political 
practice stretching back to the days of stalin when the party 
leader was supreme ruler 
before the vote liberals led by sergei stankevich a student of 
american politics and spokesman for the interregional deputies 
group and anatoly sobchak a leningrad legislator said the 
presidency as proposed would be subject to abuse 
all our decisions can be crossed out by the president 
sobchak told the 542member legislature 
he and stankevich said the proposed presidency would tilt the 
balance of power toward the chief executive and away from the 
legislature 
many soviets today see the need for an iron hand to solve the 
countrys problems 
were tired from social tension when are you going to put the 
country in order legislator rano ubaidullaeva said her 
constituents are saying we need a person who can have real power 
the quicker the better 
the draft bill released today says the president must be a 
soviet citizen and be at least 35 years old he would be elected to 
a fiveyear term directly by universal suffrage 
the official who introduced the bill however said the 
procedure would be different the first time 
vladimir kudryavtsev a vice president of the academy of 
sciences said the first president would be elected by the congress 
of peoples deputies to a fouryear term he said it would take too 
long to prepare direct elections now 
other provisions would give the president power to declare a 
state of emergency or war to serve as commanderinchief of the 
armed forces and to veto legislation the supreme soviet could 
override the veto by a majority vote but the president could then 
appeal to the congress or call a referendum on the issue 
the president could also ask the legislature to hold a vote of 
no confidence in the countrys premier and council of ministers 
the nominal cabinet 
a new body of advisers would be created called a presidential 
council 
for the first time the law specifies a detailed procedure of 
succession if the president is unable to fulfill his duties the 
chairman of the supreme soviet or premier would rule until 
presidential elections are held within three months 
in another first the bill provides for impeachment of the 
president if he violates the constitution 
a majority of baltic legislators announced they will not 
participate in the debate or vote on the proposed presidency 
because they believe it inappropriate to do so before the structure 
between the republics and central government is decided 
estonia latvia and lithuania are fighting to restore the 
independence they had between the two world wars 
georgian lawmakers also announced they would not participate 
because they said it was unclear how the office would be used 
it is widely assumed gorbachev will seek the post but he has 
refused to commit himself as a candidate

president bush is failing to back up his 
rhetoric about educational excellence with federal money and the 
administrations proposed 2 percent spending increase for schools 
is meager and tepid house speaker thomas s foley said 
today 
while i commend the president for his desire to be known as 
the education president i question whether he can achieve that 
goal by proposing a meager 2 percent increase in the federal 
spending on education foley told the nations governors 
the simple fact is we dont have a 2 percent education problem 
in this country he said the education gap is much more 
daunting 
foley spoke to the bipartisan national governors association as 
it concluded its annual winter meeting 
speaking to the state executives on monday bush praised their 
education goals but left some democratic governors grumbling that 
the administration wasnt recommending additional money to help the 
states pay for implementing them 
foley said bushs proposed education spending amounted to 
tepid incrementalism he said the united states lags behind 
much of the industrial world in per capita spending on kindergarten 
through 12th grade education 
we need bolder action he said 
foley also said the lessening in world tensions would result in 
budget savings for the united states the peace dividend 
anticipated from reduced demands for military spending 
answering questions from the governors foley predicted an 
actual cut in military spending not just in its rate of growth 
but he said the absolute reduction would probably take about 
five years to appear 
he also complained that the administration was not releasing for 
spending on highways and airports money accumulated from excise 
taxes in trust funds a frequent complaint of the governors 
foley said that amounted to 17 billion for highways and 14 
billion for airports money he said was being retained to make the 
federal deficit look smaller 
the governors main accomplishments at their meeting came sunday 
with approval of a set of goals for improving education and 
mondays meeting with bush at the white house 
gov richard celeste of ohio chairman of the democratic 
governors said he asked bush in their private meeting about 
putting more money into education celeste said the money was 
needed to translate what is ambitious rhetoric into action 
he seemed unaccountably reluctant to make any commitments 
celeste said he steered away from anything that would smack of 
additional resources 
the groups education goals follow closely the proposals bush 
made last month in his state of the union speech bush praised the 
governors for their work on education and said he would try to keep 
it in the forefront of americas agenda 
we are launching a new era in education reform bush said 
its focus high expectations its hallmark results 
republican gov terry branstad of iowa chairman of the national 
governors association said governors were committed over the 
next decade to holding ourselves accountable on meeting the goals 
but democratic gov l douglas wilder of virginia said the goals 
may not be reachable if the federal government doesnt propose more 
funds 
republican gov carroll campbell of south carolina who was 
cochairman of the governors education task force noted that the 
federal government pays only about 7 percent of the cost of public 
schools 
were going to have to carry the bulk of this we and the 
local communities he said 
the governors were voting today on several policy resolutions 
including one recommending a cleanair act requiring up to 1 
million vehicles be produced annually that make use of an 
alternative fuel 
celeste a twoterm governor barred by ohio state law from 
seeking reelection this year gave voice to democrats frustration 
with bushs skyhigh approval rating in the polls 
a president with an 80 percent popularity rating he could 
take on any tough issue what is the tough issue hes going to take 
on i dont see any hes sort of suspended out there as i say in 
his own medium at a distance from all of us he said

fewer than 2 percent of americans questioned 
in a new survey say they might try cocaine if it were legal but 
60 percent say they think someone else would 
threefifths of those questioned in the poll released today by 
the drug policy foundation said all drug use is immoral and should 
be illegal while 35 percent disagreed 
and 55 percent said they believe the bush administrations war 
on drugs is likely to reduce the drug problem while 36 percent 
favored legalization of less serious drugs along with an increase 
in drug treatment and education 
when given the choice between providing treatment and counseling 
for drug users or punishing drug users with fines andor 
imprisonment 68 percent favored treatment and 21 percent favored 
punishment 
in rejecting the war on drug users and in choosing not to use 
drugs even if drugs were legal americans are saying make health 
not war foundation president arnold s trebach said in a 
statement released with the survey 
trebach said today that he interpreted the survey to mean in 
general the american people say we would like a compromise we 
would like to see that we treat this problem within the health 
system not the criminal justice system if they see no option 
they might go for the criminal justice system i think its a 
call for enlightened leadership 
the drug policy foundation advocates treating drug abuse as a 
health problem not a criminal justice issue and has encouraged 
drug decriminalization efforts 
despite the 61 percent who said all drug use is immoral and 
should be illegal foundation vice president kevin zeese said 
there is significant support for outright legalization of drugs 
americans are realizing that more jails more arrests and more 
seizures will never solve the drug problem 
national drug control policy director william j bennett has 
called legalization advocacy stupid and morally atrocious 
bennett speaking briefly to reporters at the white house today 
brushed off the report and said some progress has been made 
now that were starting to see some encouraging signs why put 
up the white flag he said 
the poll of 1401 adult americans in a random digitaldial 
telephone sample done jan 24feb 4 by targeting systems inc of 
arlington va has a margin of error of 3 percentage points said 
company president charles welsh richard j dennis of chicago 
chairman of the drug policy foundation advisory board paid for the 
survey 
the survey revealed some mixed messages while 36 percent said 
they favored legalization of less dangerous drugs combined with 
more treatment and education over the bush administration plan 75 
percent said they wanted more federal law enforcement efforts 
seventy percent said they wanted more federal drug treatment and 
education and 71 percent said it was more important to take any 
step necessary to stop drug use than to protect civil rights and 
civil liberties 
trebach said today that the response to that latter question 
made him very nervous 
my interpretation of that is the american people are 
annoyed enough about this drug problem worried enough about it 
that if their leaders suggest an invasion of a little country in 
south america if they suggest a search of cars and all kinds of 
other invasions of civil rights it is possible the american people 
will support it that is an enormous danger he said 
of those polled 11 percent said they had tried cocaine 
hydrochloride cocaine powder while 89 percent said they had not 
asked the likelihood of their trying cocaine if that drug were 
legalized 17 percent said they were very likely or somewhat 
likely to do so while 969 percent said they were unlikely to try 
it 
however 60 percent said they believe cocaine use would increase 
if it were no longer a crime ten percent said cocaine use would 
decrease while 27 percent said it would stay the same 
of those who had never tried cocaine 09 percent said they 
might try it if it were legalized while 9 percent of those who had 
used it before said they were at least somewhat likely to try it 
again 
for marijuana 35 percent of those polled said they had tried 
it 65 percent had not overall 888 percent said they were not 
very likely or not at all likely to try it if it were legalized 
while 96 percent said they might but 50 percent said marijuana 
use would increase if it were legalized while 12 percent said it 
would decrease and 37 percent said it would stay the same 
regarding medical use of some prohibited drugs 76 percent said 
physicians should be allowed to prescribe heroin as a painkiller 
for terminally ill cancer patients and 69 percent said they should 
be allowed to prescribe marijuana as a treatment for glaucoma 
one question was prefaced with the statement the current law 
enforcement efforts to curb drug use cost taxpayers hundreds of 
millions of dollars per year with an everincreasing prison 
population reaching 1 million people in the us 
respondents then were asked whether tax dollars are best used 
for imprisoning all drug users or whether other less 
expensive methods such as treatment programs and drug education 
should be allocated more of the tax dollars in response 74 
percent selected treatment and education 13 percent chose 
imprisonment for all drug users 7 percent volunteered that both 
were good choices

the tokyo stock exchanges key index rebounded 
strongly today from its secondsteepest oneday plunge ever as 
investors took comfort from advances on major overseas markets 
analysts said 
the dollar continued its gain against the japanese yen for the 
sixth consecutive trading day reaching an eightmonth high despite 
heavy dollarselling by japans central bank in support of the yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues climbed 57608 
points or 173 percent closing at 3389795 
on monday it had fallen 45 percent or 156910 points second 
only to the 383648point plunge on oct 20 1987 following wall 
streets black monday 
the gain in tokyo helped boost prices in new york and london 
today 
on wall street the dow jones industrial average was up 698 to 
260946 at 11 am est traders said the us market was reassured 
by the improvement on the tokyo exchange 
in london the financial timesstock exchange 100stock index 
the major barometer of the british equities market was up 71 
points or 03 percent at 22564 at midday 
there was disagreement on whether the tokyo market had hit 
bottom but shiro suzuki an analyst at nikko securities co said 
especially individual investors gained confidence since mondays 
plunge did not have negative effects on the new york and london 
markets overnight 
suzuki said there would be no major buying by institutional 
investors now awaiting account settlements at the end of japans 
fiscal year on march 31 
the recent fall of tokyo stock prices has been blamed on stock 
bond and yen prices all driving each other down in a vicious cycle 
and on computerguided trading by foreign brokerages taking 
advantage of different prices for the same issue on different 
markets for instance the spot and futures markets 
late monday the tokyo stock exchange asked major securities 
companies to restrict this arbitrage selling 
also monday the finance ministry bought some 671 million worth 
of 10year government bonds in an attempt to stop bond prices from 
falling and to push longterm interest rates down 
in this mornings session arbitrage selling by some securities 
firms for profittaking amounted to some 201 million said 
kazuyuki suzuki a dealer with daiwa securities co he said this 
brought a moderate decline in the index which later climbed again 
hironobu takahashi a spokesman of the tokyo stock exchange 
said it is rather difficult to evaluate the market reaction from 
just one day of trading but i believe our member firms understood 
what we asked yesterday and tried to be cooperative 
on monday when the finance ministry was buying bonds the yield 
for the benchmark no 119 10year government bond fell to 6875 
percent from a high of 7015 percent the ministry stayed out of

a judge today ordered the acquittal of a 
state social worker accused of failing to report suspected child 
abuse prior to the pottytraining death of a toddler 
after the state called three witnesses polk county judge jesse 
barber said that prosecutors simply didnt prove the charge and 
issued the directed verdict 
no reasonable jury could reach any other verdict than for 
acquittal the judge said after two key state witnesses testified 
the social worker acted appropriately 
kenneth houk was the first of three state department of health 
and rehabilitative services workers to face trial in connection 
with the death of 2yearold bradley mcgee 
the toddler died july 28 of head injuries after he was dunked 
repeatedly headfirst into a toilet for soiling his pants and beaten 
with pillows prosecutors said 
the trial marks the first time in florida that a childcare 
worker has been prosecuted for his handling of a case the 
misdemeanor carried a maximum penalty of up to 60 days in jail 
bradleys mother and stepfather sheryl mcgee coe 21 and 
thomas coe 22 of lakeland face trial this summer on 
firstdegree murder and aggravated child abuse charges 
houk 39 was accused of twice failing to call the hrs abuse 
hotline when he received calls about bradley 
prosecutors said houk got a call in december 1988 claiming the 
mother was unfit because she was drinking and using cocaine and 
only weeks before bradleys death he received another call that 
the babys mother had forced him to eat feces as punishment for 
violating potty training 
a key state witness theresa jacobs who originally reported the 
feces complaint told the jury that houk had urged her numerous 
times to telephone the child abuse registry when she had a 
complaint to report 
she said she didnt follow his advice 
he had told me before to call the registry but i never got 
any satisfaction from the registry ms jacobs testified i 
didnt see him eat feces i didnt see the bruises 
houks attorneys claim he acted in good faith by telling ms 
jacobs the first time to notify the toddlers assigned caseworker 
he did not just not do anything wilkins said theyre 
saying he did the wrong thing 
a jury was chosen monday attorneys found all of the prospective 
jurors were familiar with the bradley mcgee case with some saying 
they had read every news article about it 
caseworkers margaret barber and shirley duboise are also charged 
with failing to report child abuse in the case ms barber faces an 
additional charge of felony child abuse

authorities today defended police checkpoints 
as an effective weapon against drunken driving but an attorney for 
a group of michigan motorists told the supreme court the stops 
violate privacy and do not work 
we think they are very effective said thomas l casey 
assistant state solicitor general in michigan they do result in 
arrests of drunk drivers they do have a deterrent effect they do 
have an educational effect 
mark granzotto a detroit lawyer representing the motorists 
argued however as a means of acting against drunken driving 
sobriety roadblocks are worthless 
they dont work granzotto said when challenged by chief 
justice william rehnquist to explain why they were ineffective 
justice byron white asked granzotto why if the roadbocks are 
ineffective many states have adopted them 
they are a very visible means of showing that something is 
being done the lawyer replied 
casey argued that the intrusion into peoples privacy has been 
kept to a minimum under the michigan procedure 
he said people have to be willing to be a little bit 
inconvenienced because of the seriousness of the drunkendriving 
problem 
granzotto said he did not disagree that the problem is serious 
however he said we have an intrusion that may be minimal in 
some respects but it is an intrusion that does not accomplish 
anything 
the courts decision is expected by july 
lower courts have split on the issue some have upheld the use 
of checkpoints others like the michigan courts have ruled that 
such police tactics violate privacy rights 
president bush called on state and local governments in december 
to step up the fight against drunken driving 
its as crippling as crack as random gang violence and its 
killing more kids than both combined he said 
the president noted that state and local governments are 
receiving federal aid to operate sobriety checkpoints 
michigan state police first used sobriety checkpoints which 
they modeled after a program used in maryland in 1986 
at a checkpoint site police directed all traffic headed in one 
direction to a roadside area where officers checked motorists for 
signs of intoxication 
if there was no immediate evidence of intoxication the motorist 
was given a traffic safety brochure and allowed to drive away the 
average delay was about a halfminute 
if some signs of intoxication were detected a driver was 
directed to another area for further questioning and perhaps a 
breath test 
at one such checkpoint michigan state police troopers checked 
126 vehicles in less than an hour and detained two drivers for 
sobriety field tests one driver was arrested on drunken driving 
charges 
seven michigan residents sued the state police soon after the 
checkpoint program began their lawsuit alleged that the 
checkpoints violated the fourth amendments ban on unreasonable 
police searches and arrests 
state courts struck down the practice citing the potential 
for an unreasonable subjective intrusion on individual liberty 
interests 
michigans appeal is being supported in friend of the court 
briefs by 27 states and groups including the national governors 
association the national league of cities mothers against drunk 
driving and the alliance of american insurers 
the supreme court in 1979 barred police from randomly stopping 
vehicles to check registration papers in that delaware case 
officers had total discretion over which vehicles were stopped 
but the 1979 decision did not rule out spot checks in which an 
officers discretion was not so unconstrained questioning of all 
oncoming traffic at roadblocktype stops is one possible 
alternative the decision said 
at issue in a separate case from pennsylvania also being heard 
today was whether motorists must be given socalled miranda 
warnings before police videotape their taking sobriety field tests 
the court will decide by july whether police violated a 
motorists rights when they videotaped his answers to questions 
about his height weight and eye color before telling him he could 
remain silent and was entitled to have a lawyer present 
the cases are michigan state police vs sitz 881897 and 
pennsylvania vs muniz 89213

newly reelected prime minister toshiki kaifu today 
formed a new cabinet after hours of factional wrangling and 
succeeded in keeping out scandaltainted politicians 
the backstage maneuvering followed parliaments vote earlier 
tday to leave the prime ministers post with kaifu who led his 
liberal democratic party to victory in crucial elections feb 18 
for parliaments powerful lower house 
kaifu completed the delicate task of distributing cabinet 
portfolios among party factions just three days before leaving for 
a summit meeting with president bush 
in a major test of his political muscle kaifu was able to 
resist a senior faction leader who pushed strongly for the 
inclusion of koko sato sato had been given a suspended sentence in 
a 1970s scandal in which lockheed aircraft corp paid bribes to 
politicians to influence sales of its aircraft in japan 
as expected kaifu retained foreign minister taro nakayama and 
finance minister ryutaro hashimoto to preserve continuity in 
dealing with an unpopular new sales tax and trade frictions with 
the united states 
kaifu became prime minister last august after two predecessors 
resigned over the more recruit influencebuying scandal and the 
governing partys loss of its upper house majority for the first 
time in 34 years 
with his clean image kaifu got the nod despite his weak power 
base in the party senior leaders stayed on the sidelines because 
of their links to the recruit scandal 
but with the partys unexpectedly comfortable majority in the 
feb 18 elections kaifu felt his position strengthened while 
party elders insisted the result also meant public exoneration for 
scandaltainted politicians who retained their seats in parliament 
kaifu insisted on keeping a clean cabinet 
former finance minister michio watanabe stalled negotiations for 
several hours by insisting on a post for sato a close ally who has 
been elected to the lower house nine times but never served as a 
cabinet minister 
former agriculture minister kabun muto was named minister of 
international trade and industry another sensitive post as 
washington steps up demands that japan restructure its economy to 
eradicate its 49 billion trade surplus with the united states 
trade will be a main topic taken up by kaifu and bush in their 
twoday meeting friday and saturday 
other lawmakers who were appointed cabinet ministers included 
justice minister shin hasegawa labor minister shunpei tsukahara 
construction minister tamisuke watanuki education minister kosuke 
hori and defense agency director general yozo ishikawa 
dropped from the cabinet were both women from kaifus first 
cabinet one of them mayumi moriyama a member of the upper house 
had been chief cabinet secretary the top government spokeswoman 
she was reported angered at being replaced by misoji sakamoto 
another top kaifu aide despite her tireless campaigning in the 
election women voters have been getting increased attention 
especially after their strong objections to a new 3 percent sales 
tax were seen as a key factor in the governing partys upper house 
losses in last julys elections 
economic planning agency director general sumiko takahara also 
was replaced by a man hideyuki aizawa 
the cabinet resigned en masse earlier today paving the way for 
kaifu to reorganize his administration after a flurry of meetings 
with the partys various faction heads 
former prime minister noboru takeshita exforeign minister 
shintaro abe and exfinance minister kiichi miyazawa all linked 
to the recruit scandal control the three largest factions 
kaifu 59 belongs to a minor faction led by former state 
minister toshio komoto and needs the support of the larger factions 
to maintain the party presidency and thus the prime ministers 
position 
in parliament kaifu won 286 of 508 valid votes cast in the 
powerful lower house which formally chooses the prime minister he 
needed a majority of 255 to win socialist party chairwoman takako 
doi his nearest rival won 146 
kaifu bowed as his formal reelection was proclaimed he was 
greeted by a round of rousing applause and scattered cheers 
in the oppositioncontrolled 252seat upper house kaifu failed 
to win a clear majority in the first round of balloting but won in 
a runoff with ms doi 11191 fortyfour ballots were left blank 
the lower house decision is binding with or without the assent 
of the upper house but the lack of consensus is rare when kaifu 
first assumed office six months ago he was the first prime 
minister in 41 years who was not nominated by both houses

chinese american and soviet mountaineers plan to 
scale mount everest and clean up some of the 2 tons of discarded 
tents oxygen bottles and other garbage left by generations of 
climbers on the worlds highest peak 
the expedition a new kind of superpower summitry is chinas 
biggest joint cultural undertaking with any foreign country since 
june when its violent crackdown on protesters strained ties with 
many countries 
jim whittaker of port townsend wash who organized what he is 
calling the everest peace climb tried to emphasize the political 
implications at a us embassy reception tuesday on the eve of the 
teams flight to tibet 
will the friendly climb affect tense chineseamerican relations 
we hope it will we hope theres peace whittaker answered 
quickly one chinese one soviet and one american will stand on 
the summit with our arms around each other demonstrating that with 
cooperation high goals can be reached 
but us ambassador james lilley to whom the question had been 
directed smiled uncomfortably and said i believe it stands on 
its own normal peopletopeople relations 
for several hours chinese american and soviet officials 
mingled at lilleys residence and heard speeches about friendship 
and cooperation a scene that was common in beijing before june 
but has become rare since 
china has accused the united states of seeking to undermine its 
socialist system and privately has labeled the soviets 
revisionist for political reforms that have weakened the role 
of the communist party 
all three countries appeared in agreement however on the need 
to clean up mount everest the team of 17 americans 17 chinese and 
12 soviets plans to bring down as much as it can of the estimated 2 
tons of garbage left at camp sites on the himalayan peak on the 
nepaltibet border 
were going to take duffle bags and load them up said 
whittaker 61 in places we can drop the garbage let it 
freefall and then well pick it up at the bottom burn what will 
burn and bury the rest 
we want to leave no trace of humans on the mountain 
the 29028foot mountain was first scaled in 1953 by sir edmund 
hillary and tenzing norgay since then dozens of teams have 
swarmed over its lower reaches each year although fewer than 250 
climbers have reached the top 
whittaker who in 1963 became the first american to reach mount 
everests summit said he saw no sign at the top of those who went 
before him but that his own team left empty oxygen bottles and 
other debris 
we thought differently in those days we werent as concerned 
about the environment because there werent so many people going 
into the hills he said 
the expedition plans to send only three people to the summit 
one from each country their target date is april 22 earth day 
whittaker said the summiteers will use a satellite hookup to 
converse from the peak with president bush soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev and a chinese leader chinese sports officials 
said that probably will be premier li peng 
teams from the three countries made practice climbs together on 
mount rainier in the united states in june and in the caucasus 
mountains in the soviet union in september mount rainier is less 
than half as high as mount everest at 14410 feet 
after the first joint climb the chinese changed their team 
however and it is now made up mostly of tibetans 
most of the more than 1 million cost of the expedition is being 
paid by us corporate sponsors and individual donations

the chroniclers of communist abuses are 
amassing a list of valuable works of art from polish museums loaned 
to party and government ministries but never returned 
thanks to those loans many very valuable objects were lost 
but things are changing a television commentator said in a 
recent report 
the polish opposition has taken power without the virulence seen 
in other east bloc nations where communist leaders have been tried 
and imprisoned but the public fascination has been caught by a 
series of exposes of longsuspected abuses from the four decades 
when the communist party had total control of the government 
the press has reported in detail the partys amassing of vast 
property holdings through dubious leases from obliging city 
officials 
now it has turned to the works of art provided to the communist 
party central committee and government ministries when refusing was 
not a viable option for museum directors 
the prosecutors office has been called in and the social 
democracy of the polish republic the newly formed party that took 
over the assets and liabilities of the communist party dissolved in 
january has tried to demonstrate its new thinking with a promise 
to help locate the lost national property 
the obligation is to figure out all those secrets that now 
have been made public for example the vanishing of those 
paintings and we want to take an active part marek siwiec 
editor of the partys newspaper trybuna said in an interview 
but he said those individuals responsible should be prosecuted 
not the party 
if a crime occurred and everything indicates that a crime was 
committed one chases particular persons responsible and does 
not stigmatize an institution in which those persons worked 
siwiec said 
the social democracy party might make moral compensation 
however in money or other works of art he said 
according to a report in the government daily rzeczpospolita 
the list of missing objects is thick 
ten paintings and two sculptures are missing from among 96 
objects borrowed from the national museum by the central committee 
among the lost canvases are the 1915 still life with two 
jugs by tadeusz makowski borrowed in 1975 and the 1909 head 
of a peasant girl by teodor azentowicz loaned in 1950 
the pond by jm ronowski hung in the central committee 
headquarters for a decade and only recently was noticed to be 
missing the newspaper said 
missing since the 1970s from the council of ministers are seven 
valuable 19th century german pottery statuettes borrowed in 1949 
for thenpremier jozef cyrankiewicz rzeczpospolita said 
by november only a third of the approximately 100 paintings and 
decorative objects loaned to the culture ministry had been 
returned the daily reported 
marian soltysiak director of the national museum told polish 
tv this week that one lost object has been found in the central 
committee headquarters and three more in the national defense 
ministry 
and now i can see the breakthrough in our relations with the 
central institutions that were borrowing objects he said

the supreme court today gave prison officials 
sweeping power to force inmates to take antipsychotic drugs 
the 63 ruling in a washington state case is a victory for 
prison officials and doctors who say they and not judges should 
decide when such powerful behaviormodifying drugs are 
administered 
the justices said prisoners are not entitled to court hearings 
or other dueprocess safeguards before they must take the 
medication 
given the requirements of the prison environment justice 
anthony m kennedy wrote for the court the state may treat a 
prison inmate who has a serious mental illness with antipsychotic 
drugs against his will if the inmate is dangerous to himself or 
others and the treatment is in the inmates medical interest 
the decision as to whether to use the drugs in such 
circumstances is best left to prison officials and psychiatrists 
not judges kennedy said 
kennedy was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white harry a blackmun sandra day oconnor and 
antonin scalia 
justices john paul stevens william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall dissented 
stevens writing for the dissenters said the court mistakenly 
has concluded that a mock trial before an institutionally biased 
tribunal constitutes due process of law a competent individuals 
right to refuse psychotropic medication is an aspect of liberty 
requiring the highest order of constitutional protection 
washington corrections secretary chase riveland said the 
decision was an important one but doesnt mean his department will 
go on a medication binge 
im not suggesting that we should be willy nilly running 
around medicating people we need to be sure that people have 
appropriate input into the medication that theyre taking he 
said 
there have been abuses historically in the country not 
necessarily in prison only but in general i think that if 
medically appropriate its very helpful riveland said 
ruling in a separate case today however the supreme court said 
that people held against their will at state mental hospitals 
without receiving legally required hearings may sue state officials 
in federal court for monetary damages 
the justices voted 54 to reverse lowercourt decisions 
involving a florida man who was held in a state hospital for five 
months without a hearing that state law requires within 48 hours 
and in another case the supreme court decided 90 that the 
boeing co did not violate a federal conflictofinterest law when 
the defense contractor paid 485000 in severance to five employees 
who left to take government jobs the justices overturned a ruling 
that the money must be turned over to the government 
in the inmate case the high court overturned a washington state 
supreme court ruling in 1988 that convicted robber walter harper 
diagnosed as schizophrenic must be given a court hearing before 
antipsychotic drugs are administered to him 
the state court also said prison officials must show a 
compelling state interest to give him the medication and show that 
the drugs will be effective 
the states compelling interest can be demonstrated by a need to 
preserve life to protect others who might be harmed by harper to 
prevent his suicide and to maintain the ethical integrity of the 
medical profession the state court said 
harper was imprisoned in 1976 and for most part over the next 
four years was in a mental health unit where he agreed to take 
antipsychotic drugs 
he was paroled in 1980 on condition he continue receiving 
psychiatric care 
his parole was revoked after he attacked two nurses at saint 
cabrini hospital in seattle 
back in prison harper at first agreed to take antipsychotic 
drugs but in november 1982 he refused to take the medication any 
longer complaining it was poisoning his brain and causing other 
side effects 
a committee of prison officials decided he should be given the 
drugs against his will for his own good and to control his violent 
behavior 
harper sued the state supreme court calling the drugs as 
intrusive as electroshock therapy ruled that an inmate who has 
not been found mentally incompetent has a right to determine what 
should be done to his own body 
while the drugs are beneficial to seriously ill patients they 
also can have serious side effects ranging from involuntary spasms 
to permanent brain damage 
those who support the rights of mental patients and prisoners 
say there has been widespread abuse in prescribing antipsychotic 
drugs they have called for tighter control of doctors and public 
health officials 
they also argue that inmates like harper if need be can be 
restrained physically or placed in isolation rather than forced to 
take drugs continually 
but public health and law enforcement officials say it makes 
little sense to give an irrational or mentally disturbed person the 
right to veto sensible medical practices 
the us supreme court previously had given mental health 
authorities and prison officials wide latitude in treating and 
controlling patients and inmates 
while harpers appeal was pending before the us supreme court 
a law was enacted in washington state that requires judicial 
hearings for involuntary medication of mental patients except in 
some emergencies the new state law does not cover prison inmates 
courts in several states have ruled that mental patients who are 
not legally incompetent have a right to refuse antipsychotic drugs 
but according to some studies judges in those states almost 
always end up deciding that antipsychotic drugs may be 
administered against the individuals will after holding hearings 
in individual cases 
kennedy noted today that the court was told harper no longer is 
refusing the medication 
but kennedy said because there is no evidence harper has 
recovered from his mental illness treatment against his will may 
have to be resumed in the future therefore he said the legal 
controversy posed by the case is still alive 
the case acted on today is washington vs harper 88599

a french television reporter and her translator 
were ordered to leave china after conducting interviews without 
permission in a sensitive minority region an official report said 
tuesday 
daniele loustallot of the french television network antenne 2 is 
the first foreign correspondent ordered to leave china under a new 
press law that took effect last month it requires visiting 
reporters to obtain temporary accreditation from the government and 
limits them to approved interviews 
ms loustallot and her translator fabienne goldberg were 
working for the networks human rights program resistances 
according to program spokesman noel mamere in paris he did not 
give details of their planned report 
the peoples daily newspaper said the two arrived feb 13 in the 
xinjiang uygur autonomous region a vast mostly moslem area in 
chinas far northwest they traveled on tourist visas 
they conducted a series of illegal interviews and other 
activities not compatible with their tourist status the paper 
said without giving details it said they ignored a warning by 
the public security bureau and had a rude and unreasonable 
attitude 
it did not say what deadline was set for the women to leave 
china the french embassy said they were still in the country 
tuesday but refused to give other details 
xinjiang is sparsely populated by various minority groups 
including the uygurs who have clashed from time to time with 
chinese security forces over religious and cultural differences 
local authorities generally have treated foreign reporters with 
suspicion and last year police beat up two beijingbased foreign 
correspondents who believed they had permission to visit 
foreign journalists in beijing have come under tighter 
surveillance in recent weeks however chinese foreign minister 
qian qichen in geneva for a disarmament conference said 
journalists have great freedom i think that perhaps the freedom 
has been too extensive

a kgb agent who worked for the british for 13 
years says he escaped his country by pretending to go on his daily 
jog in moscow and catching a train to the finnish border 
oleg gordievsky who described his flight to the west in a 
bbctv interview broadcast monday also said some of the british 
spy scandals that have made headlines were baseless and damaging 
it was a waste of time waste of resources waste of paper 
all those articles were published the former spy said there 
was great damage and the public morale and the trust to the 
intelligence security services in western countries was impaired 
it was a pity it was totally unnecessary 
gordievsky said sir roger hollis who headed britains mi5 
counterespionage service from 1956 to 1965 was not a soviet agent 
writer chapman pincher and former mi5 officer peter wright 
whose book spycatcher the british government failed to suppress 
after lengthy court battles have alleged the late hollis was 
almost certainly a soviet spy 
pincher responding to gordievskys remarks said the kgb 
restricted information about highlevel double agents and that 
gordievsky would have been too junior to have known 
gordievsky said he was in a position to know if the kgb had 
recruited highlevel agents like hollis 
it was inconceivable really not to know if there had been such 
an important agent of kgb if a person like him had been kgb agent 
the people would have gossiped gordievsky said there would 
have been some indication in the files there were no signs of it 
at all 
gordievsky began to work for the british in copenhagen in the 
early 1970s after becoming disillusioned with the soviets 
particularly after the 1968 invasion of czechoslovakia 
he was transferred to london where he became one of the top kgb 
agents in britain he first learned that the soviets were 
suspicious of his activities in 1979 when a senior agent confronted 
him and six other kgb members about intelligence leaks he said 
and of course i knew that i was the source of leaks 
gordievsky said it demanded from me a tremendous selfcontrol 
and concentration not to reveal myself by body language by a 
gesture 
he said he was called to moscow in 1985 under false pretenses 
and then questioned about his activities he revealed nothing 
despite being drugged during interrogations but knew he had to 
escape 
i was very worried two or three days later when i started to 
recollect the whole content of the interrogation i realized that i 
was under strong suspicion and my life was in great danger 
he would not speak of the contacts that enabled him to escape 
but described how he stuffed his sweatsuit with identification 
papers and money then set off on his daily jog past kgb 
surveillance 
gordievsky ran to the moscowleningrad rail station where he got 
a train west to the finnish border and defected he would not say 
how he achieved the crossing 
he said his only regret was that he had to leave his wife 
leila and two daughters 
i didnt betray the country i didnt betray the people of the 
soviet union i think i betrayed the regime and the soviet 
communist system which was illegitimate wrong and in many periods 
of the soviet history even criminal he said 
gordievsky wearing a tweed jacket and smoking a pipe smiled 
easily and spoke quietly in slightly accented but very good english 
i feel myself quite well integrated into british society in 
many aspects i am like a normal british citizen with similar habits 
and customs for example the greatest sunday pleasure is to spend 
the morning reading sunday newspapers sometimes in bed 
and even i never could have expected it from me myself but 
i have developed an interest for gardening he said

who will speak for the purple loosestrife 
nobody in his right mind one weed expert said monday after the 
state senate approved a legislation to kill the bushy garden flower 
with herbicides and ban its sale or use the bill now goes to the 
house 
its a nightmare spreading across washington rick johnson 
said of the european weed which is choking wetlands across the 
northern united states johnson is thurston countys noxiousweed 
control coordinator 
each stalk of the pesky plant contains maybe a million seeds 
800000 of which are viable 
the bill provides 1 million to eradicate purple loosestrife 
other states have banned or placed restrictions on its sale 
state rep marlin appelwick said he had some concerns about the 
portion of the bill that would make it illegal to sell or use 
purple loosestrife plants or seeds violators could be fined 100 
and that includes backyard gardeners senate staffers said 
well probably do more for the underground purple loosestrife 
market than anything appelwick said imagining basements crammed 
with grow lights and rows of purple plants

israel and poland resumed full diplomatic 
relations after a 23year break tuesday the third warsaw pact 
country to renew relations with the jewish state in the past six 
months 
poland ended relations in 1967 to support the arab side in the 
middle east war hungary restored relations in september and 
czechoslovakia followed suit feb 9 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki looked on as israeli foreign 
minister moshe arens and polish foreign minister krzysztof 
skubiszewski signed the protocal at a government palace and the 
delegations sipped champagne to celebrate the longawaited event 
poland has had lowlevel ties with israel since 1987 and the new 
solidarityled government is hoping that the restoration of a 
formal embassy will lead to closer economic and cultural 
cooperation 
we are today opening a new chapter in the long history full 
of tragedies of the jewish people of poland arens told israel 
army radio i hope for good and close relations between israel 
and poland 
speaking to reporters after the ceremony arens stressed that 
israel also hopes for polish support for israeli positions in the 
middle east peace process 
he later told israel army radio he found great understanding 
for israels problems among polands leaders it seems even a 
greater and fuller understanding than we have found in western 
europe he added 
poland has said resuming relations with israel should not 
disturb its relations with arab countries poland continues to 
endorse palestinian rights to selfdetermination and skubiszewski 
held a january meeting with arab diplomats to assure continued 
support 
nevertheless state radio in libya said it had deep regret 
over the resumption of relations the polish ambassador to tripoli 
was summoned to the libyan foreign ministry and told that the 
action would harm libyanpolish relations and arabpolish relations 
generally the libyan radio report said 
arens in the radio interview said he had invited polish 
president wojciech jaruzelski to israel the invitation was 
accepted but no date was set he said 
skubiszewski also said he too had accepted an invitation to 
israel 
arens said he expected resuming diplomatic ties will lead to 
very extensive economic relations between israel and poland as 
well as closer peopletopeople links 
there is no doubt in my mind that it will bring about a 
widening a deepening and a strengthening of the relationship 
between the polish people and the jewish people in poland and 
israel arens said 
he referred to the small community of about 10000 jews 
remaining in poland after the holocaust and massive postwar 
emigration of polish jews mainly to israel and the united states 
on monday arens went on emotional visits to memorials to 
polands once vibrant jewish community which numbered 35 million 
before world war ii 
he paid homage at the monument to the warsaw ghetto uprising of 
1943 when jews held in a walledin section of the city to face 
starvation or deportation rose up against the nazi occupiers 
arens stood in silence at the monument at umschlagplatz the 
depot where 300000 warsaw jews were loaded on trains to the nazi 
concentration camps 
on tuesday arens also discussed economic issues with polish 
finance minister leszek balcerowicz met with mazowiecki and had a 
session scheduled with jaruzelski who was communist party leader 
when the thencommunist government initiated contacts with israel 
arens commended polands leadership in the democratization of 
the east bloc during a monday dinner toast and said there was a 
clear relationship with the readiness to improve ties with israel 
it is remembered in israel that poland was the first country 
in the soviet bloc to start the process of improving relations with 
israel it took great courage he said 
between 350000 to 500000 israelis were born in poland 
including the first israeli prime minister david ben gurion and 
the present one yitzhak shamir

state education officials hastily decided 
today to scrap questions about eastern europe on a sixthgrade 
social studies test instead of asking pupils to pretend the cold 
war is still raging 
the questions will be replaced as quickly as possible and we 
will send a new instructions to the teachers said glenn keever 
spokesman for the department of public instruction he said top 
officials in the department had been unaware of what the test 
administrators had done 
we will have two other questions that will be drawn from 
another test that are current in terms of present conditions in 
eastern europe keever said 
the charlotte observer reported this morning that instead of 
rewriting the 3yearold standardized tests the state education 
department was instructing teachers to tell pupils to answer the 
questions as if eastern europe hadnt changed since 1987 
it is a perfect illustration of the frailty of relying on 
standardized multiplechoice tests said john dornan executive 
director of public school forum a nonprofit education think tank 
in raleigh 
for the teacher whos really passionate about teaching current 
events this is really a disincentive and thats tragic 
about 80000 sixthgraders will take the 60question state 
social studies test used to rank and accredit schools in march 
and april third and eighthgraders take different versions 
which dont happen to contain any questions about eastern europe 
the sixthgrade version developed three years ago has two such 
questions officials said 
the two old questions were 
in an election for which candidates are citizens of the 
soviet union expected to vote a candidates of their choice b 
only male candidates over 35 years of age c candidates selected 
by the communist party d candidates who have opposed the 
communist party 
which of these countries has a democratic government a 
albania b cuba c united states d poland 
before the revolutionary changes started sweeping eastern 
europe c would be the best choice for both questions its a 
little more complicated now 
the charlotte observer reported that the state department of 
public instruction had told teachers to instruct their 
sixthgraders do not think about or consider the recent 
governmental changes that have occurred in the last few months when 
you choose your answers for the questions about eastern europe 
think about how eastern europe was in 1987 those words are taken 
from the written instructions sent to sixthgrade teachers to read 
to the pupils the instructions were dated january 1990 
keever said the scrapping of the questions was ordered by roger 
jackson deputy state school superintendent state superintendent 
of public instruction bobby etheridge and other top officials 
didnt know about the incorrect questions until today when they 
were reported in the newspaper he said

the foreign ministry has admitted it has found 
copies of the secret protocol of the 1939 sovietnazi pact that 
allotted the three independent baltic nations and part of poland to 
the soviet union 
vestnik a new soviet magazine published by the foreign 
ministry showed photographs in its premier edition that came out 
on monday of a typewritten russianlanguage copy of the secret 
additional protocol 
the soviet union has maintained it could not find any evidence 
of the protocols in its archives and still says it does not have 
the originals 
last summer soviet publications printed germanlanguage copies 
of the protocols kept in the archives of the west german foreign 
ministry 
also last summer soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev supported 
the creation of a commission to investigate claims there was such a 
protocol he said at the time that no documents had been found to 
confirm the existence of the protocol 
the protocol was signed by stalins foreign minister vyacheslav 
molotov and hitlers top diplomat joachim von ribbentrop on aug 
23 1939 a week before the outbreak of world war ii 
the document placed the independent countries of estonia latvia 
and lithuania and parts of eastern poland in the soviet sphere of 
influence and was the basis of stalins decision later to annex 
that territory to the soviet union 
the baltic republics succeeded in winning soviet government 
recognition of the existence of the protocols last year 
the magazine also published a statement by one of molotovs 
aides confirming the original had been handed over to another aide 
another confirmation of the existence of the originals

is edited in moscow and printed in vienna and costs 75 a year for

the houses chief tax writer said tuesday he 
sees absolutely no way to increase tax collections next year by 
the 139 billion president bush is proposing 
the remarks by ways and means committee chairman dan 
rostenkowski dill further dimmed the prospects that congress 
and the bush administration will quickly forge a deficitreduction 
plan for fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 
meanwhile rostenkowskis panel voted to urge the budget 
committee to take the surpluses of the social security trust fund 
out of budget deficit calculations a move that would greatly 
worsen the federal deficit problem on paper 
as part of his plan to find 375 billion in deficit reductions 
next year bush last month proposed increasing tax receipts by 
139 billion the administration estimates that cutting the 
capital gains tax would increase revenue by 49 billion with the 
rest coming from greater internal revenue service efficiency and 
increases in several minor taxes 
democratic leaders of the house and senate budget committees 
have said they oppose the ingredients of bushs plan especially 
the rate cut on capital gains taxes which they say would mainly 
benefit the wealthy they have said they might try to produce a 
budget of their own containing the same amount of new revenue 
139 billion but with a different mix 
but rostenkowski told his panel such a tack would prove 
unworkable 
i see absolutely no way we can raise 14 billion and thats 
the direction the budget committee is taking us he said 
the illinois democrat said that if his committee is told to find 
14 billion in new taxes were just not that good a magician 
unless we become very serious about reaching out for revenues that 
are certainly going to be ducks 
the word ducks was a reference to white house budget 
director richard darmans statement last year that bushs pledge of 
no new taxes applies to any levies the public would perceive as 
taxes he used the expression that if something walks and talks 
like a duck its a duck 
bush has repeatedly promised to veto increases in such taxes 
congress democratic leaders have said that therefore they will 
propose no tax increases that will provoke a veto and leave their 
party as the sole advocate of higher taxes 
the ways and means panel voted tuesday by voice against 
rostenkowski to ask that social security trust fund surpluses be 
removed from deficit calculations 
supporters of the proposal sponsored by rep byron dorgan 
dnd said the surpluses make the federal deficit appear smaller 
the public thus feels less urgency to address the problem they 
said 
it was the first congressional vote of the year on the issue 
which has been a focus of attention on capitol hill since sen 
daniel moynihan dny proposed cutting the social security 
payroll tax 
opponents mainly republicans said dorgans plan would force 
congress to find tens of billions of dollars in extra savings each 
year to meet the declining annual deficit targets of the 
grammrudman law 
rostenkowski said he might eventually support dorgans proposal 
but he opposed it tuesday saying he first wanted to discuss the 
matter with the budget panel 
the social security trust fund will have a surplus next year of 
74 billion the congressional budget office estimates counting 
that infusion of money the white house projects the 1991 deficit 
at 101 billion not including the savings bush has proposed

a small party backed by west german 
chancellor helmut kohl said tuesday the east german elections 
should be postponed because voting rules were not available in time 
to permit fair competition 
the german social union told the supreme court its chances and 
those of other small parties were hurt because national newspapers 
did not publish procedures for the march 18 ballot the first free 
election in east germanys 40year history 
parliament approved the regulations a week ago in the form of a 
lengthy voting law which was printed and made available at 
bookstores friday it set monday as the deadline for parties to 
notify the national election committee if they planned to run 
candidates 
representatives of the german social union known as the dsu by 
its german initials got a copy of the law from the election 
committee friday and were able to register before the deadline 
its complaint to the court said newly formed parties had too 
little chance to prepare candidate lists for the 400 parliament 
seats which must be given to the committee by wednesday and asked 
that the vote be delayed at least until early may 
elections originally were scheduled for may 6 but the german 
social union and other parties pressed the communistled interim 
government to move the date up partly from fear the economy would 
collapse before may 
some larger parties including the communists have political 
networks with offices telephones vehicles and other advantages 
not available to new groups that have sprung up since the 
prodemocracy movement began last fall 
even so the clear leader is the social democratic party 
founded less than five months ago and supported by the sister party 
that is west germanys main opposition 
polls of east german voters predict the social democrats will 
get at least 50 percent of the vote march 18 
kohls christian democratic union supports the german social 
union east german christian democratic union and democratic 
awakening which are joined in a conservative alliance 
thousands of east germans cheered kohl at a rally last week in 
erfurt but it was no match for the emotional welcome given former 
chancellor willy brandt at a weekend rally of social democrats in 
leipzig 
putting off the election would give the smaller parties a fairer 
chance said joachim novak deputy chairman of the german social 
union 
we have argued from the beginning that it is unfair for the 
new parties to have to compete against organized forces so soon 
he said 
as a minimum the regulations should have been published in 
the newspapers failure to distribute the procedural information 
broadly is clearly a violation of the constitution 
east german newspapers remain technically under government 
control although they have undergone great changes since the 
hardline leadership of erich honecker was ousted in october none 
published the text of the election law 
many government offices and enterprises have virtually halted 
operations until the elections allow plans for economic rescue and 
german reunification to proceed 
west germany has offered to make its deutschmark the official 
currency of both germanys but only after a democratically elected 
government is in power and laws are rewritten to foster conversion 
to a freemarket economy

the suspended landlord of nearly 350 federally 
subsidized housing projects told a congressional panel today that 
he tried repeatedly to improve conditions at problem developments 
but was denied help by government officials 
huds administration and oversight of innercity problem 
housing has been abysmal and verges on the criminal said a 
bruce rozet who was recently suspended from any new department of 
housing and urban development work because of questions about past 
management of a handful of projects 
they have condemned tenants to live in squalor while pleading 
the poverty of the government and trying to shift the blame 
rozet said accusing hud of trying to shift the blame for faulty 
housing programs 
they have raised the hopes of poor innercity residents with 
rhetoric and promises of action and then dashed their hopes on the 
anvil of purported reform and miserly budgets 
rozet is locked in a bitter battle with hud and secretary jack 
kemp who last month suspended rozets associated financial corp 
or afc and a web of affiliates from any new department contracts 
several kemp aides were on hand for the hearing by the house 
banking subcommittee on housing and on occasion scribbled 
questions on note paper and shuttled them to republican lawmakers 
subcommittee mmbers had dozens of questions about the suspension 
and the condition of the nearly 45000 units at developments owned 
or partly controlled by the californiabased companies the panel 
said it planned to call rozet back after hearing from hud officials 
and tenants of some afcrelated properties 
the subcommittees chairman rep henry b gonzalez dtexas 
said it was clear that inconsistent policies at hud and high 
turnover had at least contributed to problems plaguing developments 
controlled by private groups such as rozets 
he said he wanted to call hud officials to see to what extent 
the agencys hands were dirtied but then added to rozet im 
not too sure about yours 
rozet said he welcomed the review he predicted the panel would 
agree with his contention that hud should shoulder most of the 
blame for poor conditions a position he supported by referring to 
several cases in which he said hud had ignored or rejected 
renovation plans his company or affiliates presented 
most of those cases were before kemp took office last year 
rozet a prominent democratic fundraiser said his company perhaps 
would have fared better had he hired republican consultants a 
reference to past congressional testimony of rampant 
influencepeddling at hud during the tenure of kemps predecessor 
samuel r pierce jr 
but rozet also intensified his attacks on kemp saying that hud 
has done nothing under his leadership to improve housing 
hud issued the suspension after alleging that afcs management 
affiliate housing resources management misused government and 
tenant funds at developments in oklahoma and the district of 
columbia 
a hud memo indicated the departments inspector general is 
working with the fbi to investigate whether the company overbilled 
for rent subsidies in oklahoma 
kemp in answer to earlier rozet criticisms has defended the 
suspension and denied rozets contention it was politically 
motivated 
rozet in an interview earlier this month said the company had 
ample evidence to refute the allegations but had been denied a hud 
hearing because of the suspension rozet said afc and its 
affiliates were seeking to relinquish control over most of the 
nearly 350 properties they manage in 40 states and puerto rico 
in his statement today before the banking committees housing 
subcommittee rozet said only a small number of afcs properties 
are troubled and that most were acquired in late 1986 after hud 
promised to help revitalize the developments but hud has reneged 
he said 
the one thing hud cannot do and congress cannot let them do 
is to make no decision and turn their back on the problem 
rozet said accusing kemps hud of ignoring provisions of federal 
housing law that require the agency to try to help troubled housing 
developments 
he said a legislative package passed last year at kemps request 
gave the secretary new powers to penalize housing owners the 
department blames for poor conditions 
has hud obtained the legal right to stab the owner in the back 
and then fine him for bleeding on the carpet rozet asked

senate and white house negotiators moved 
closer tuesday to agreement on how to reduce smogcausing 
automobile emissions sources said as private talks resumed on a 
compromise cleanair bill 
senate majority leader george mitchell reiterated that he 
intends to bring the bill to a floor test on thursday even if a 
compromise package is not reached with the bush administration 
disagreements over pollution controls on automobiles especially 
toughened tailpipe controls have been a focus of much of the 
private discussions between key senators and senior administration 
officials over the last three weeks 
a daylong round of closeddoor negotiations that lasted well 
into the early hours of tuesday produced tentative agreements on a 
number of areas including increased pollution controls on toxic 
and smogcausing industrial emissions and on an alternative fuels 
program 
at the same time the negotiators agreed to jettison a proposal 
sought by environmentalists that would have required automakers to 
sharply increase their cars fuel economy according to sources 
close to the talks the provision aimed at concerns about global 
warming would have required controls on carbon dioxide emissions 
from cars automakers had lobbied vigorously against it 
at the same time differences were narrowed on how to cut 
smogcausing pollutants from automobiles including agreement for 
the first time by white house negotiators on conditions for 
imposing a second round of nationwide tailpipe emission controls 
according to the sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the sources emphasized that details remained to be worked out on 
when such toughened controls would kick in nationwide president 
bush has insisted that the tightened automobile pollution controls 
a key element in the senate bill to curb urban smog were too 
expensive automakers have argued the new standards could not be 
met with current technology 
the negotiators met past midnight monday and resumed the talks 
tuesday focusing first on acid rain controls and then again on the 
automobile emissions questions 
mitchell began the talks with the administration feb 2 in an 
effort to enlist white house support for a compromise bill he 
acknowledged that the tougher legislation approved by the senate 
environment and pubilc works committee last november had 
encountered strong regional opposition and was sure to face a 
filibuster on the senate floor 
the legislation would be the first revision of the federal clean 
air law in 13 years 
senate leaders and the administration were generally in 
agreement over the acid rain provisions of the bill which call for 
coalburning electric utilities to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions 
by 10 million tons a year 
but those acid rain controls have been opposed by a group of 
midwest senators who seek a costsharing provision to help pay for 
installing expensive pollution controls at some of the dirtiest 
utility plants 
at the same time other senators from states where plants are 
relatively clean have opposed any such cost sharing and sought 
assurances instead that the controls will not hinder future growth 
while both the white house and mitchell are opposed to any 
national energy tax or fee to help pay for the pollution controls 
the negotiations on acid rain have centered on trying to 
accommodate the various regional concerns sources said

former surgeon general c everett koop said 
tuesday that a federal aids policy is almost 10 years overdue 
koop also told a house energy and commerce subcommittee that he 
was alarmed at a growing complacency about the aids epidemic 
which he said is overburdening bigcity hospitals while spreading 
to rural areas 
rep henry a waxman dcalif chairman of the house health and 
environment subcommittee before which koop testified said 
president bush has yet to act on groundwork laid when koop was 
surgeon general under president reagan 
having missed the opportunity to get the ounce of prevention 
we now have to pay for the pounds and pounds of cure said 
waxman who was hearing testimony on his proposed legislation to 
expand medicaid coverage for people with aids or infected with the 
hiv virus believed to cause the disease 
although koop didnt speak as sharply as waxman he repeatedly 
stated his disappointment with both congress and the white house 
there are ample opportunities for the white house and 
congress to develop an aids policy koop said i think its 
almost 10 years overdue 
my concerns this morning have yet to be addressed at a 
national level said koop he said later it seems incredible 
that the federal government has not had a dialogue with state and 
local governments and insurers 
i also am disappointed to sense the amount of complacency 
about the aids epidemic he said adding that official government 
figures are probably underreported 
under waxmans legislation medicaid coverage would include 
early intervention with drugs such as azt and aerosol pentamidine 
those drugs are expensive 3500 a year for azt or 1100 for 
pentamidine according to waxmans staff but the cost of 
hospitalization is even higher 15000 per admission 
the bill would create a presumption of disability for people who 
have the virus but who may not have developed the symptoms making 
it easier for them to qualify for the early intervention 
other provisions deal with reimbursements for care of people 
already sick including babies and children with aids 
koop said the complacency is due to three mistaken beliefs 
that the leveledoff projections for new cases 40000 this 
year as opposed to 35000 recorded cases last year mean a 
shrinking epidemic 
that because the spread is confined to black and hispanic drug 
users the general population is less likely to be threatened 
that many believe the disease is not spread through 
heterosexual contact 
koop said the epidemic is having its most serious impact on 
bigcity hospitals where more and more beds as many as 25 percent 
in new york are occupied by aids victims 
as a result patients with other ailments wait too long for beds 
to become available medical and nursing students work elsewhere 
because of fear of contagion and a lack of variety in the types of 
patients and budgets are drained because aids patients usually 
have already exhausted their funds by the time they reach the 
hospitsl according to testimony

just over half the respondents in a new survey 
say they feel the bush administrations lawenforcement approach to 
the war on illegal drugs will reduce the countrys drug problem 
at the same time slightly more than onethird say they favor 
legalization for less serious drugs and an increase in drug 
treatment and education programs 
national drug control policy director william j bennett who 
has called legalization advocacy stupid and morally atrocious 
dismissed the survey saying some progress has been made in the war 
on drugs 
now that were starting to see some encouraging signs why put 
up the white flag he rhetorically asked reporters at the white 
house 
the telephone poll of 1401 adult americans was done jan 
24feb 4 by targeting systems inc of arlington va for the drug 
policy foundation which says it advocates treating drug abuse as a 
health problem not a criminal justice issue the survey has a 
margin of error of 3 percentage points 
richard j dennis of chicago chairman of the foundations 
advisory board paid for the survey 
among the polls findings 
55 percent of the respondents said they believe the 
administrations primarily law enforcement approach to the war on 
drugs including more prison sentences for casual drug use using 
the military to fight drug trafficking and more money for prisons 
is likely to reduce the drug problem 
36 percent favor legalization of less serious drugs along with 
an increase in drug treatment and education aid 
asked if it was more important to take any step necessary 
in order to stop drug use than to protect civil liberties 71 
percent chose taking any step necessary 
fewer than 2 percent said they might try cocaine if it were 
legalized but 60 percent say they think cocaine use would go up if 
it were no longer a crime ten percent said cocaine use would 
decrease if it were legalized and 27 percent said it would stay the 
same 
96 percent said they might try marijuana if it were legalized 
while 50 percent said marijuana use would increase if it were not a 
crime twelve percent said it would decrease and 37 percent said it 
would stay the same 
given the choice between providing treatment and counseling for 
drug users or punishing them with fines and imprisonment 68 
percent favored treatment and 21 percent favored punishment 
61 percent said all drug use is immoral and should be illegal 
while 35 percent disagreed with that view 
as for medical uses of some prohibited drugs 76 percent said 
doctors should be allowed to prescribe heroin as a painkiller for 
terminally ill cancer patients while 69 percent said physicians 
should be allowed to prescribe marijuana as a treatment for 
glaucoma

conventional wisdom took almost as bad a 
beating in nicaragua as president daniel ortega 
one of the most profoundly held views of the reagan 
administration for example was that ortega could never be counted 
on to hold a free and fair election 
the perception of ortega as an antidemocrat guided every policy 
decision concerning nicaragua that the administration took the 
notion that ortega would hold a fair election and agree to turn 
over power if he lost was laughable a tall tale belonging on the 
fiction shelf 
several years ago one official who had the audacity to suggest 
that ortega was a moderate in the sandinista political context was 
looked on almost as a subversive by administration hardliners he 
was banished to appen after a sandinista victory giving the alternative 
possibility short shrift 
their views of course were fed by the pollsters who were 
predicting a sandinista victory in excess of 15 percentage points 
it is now obvious that a significant number of nicaraguans gave the 
safe answer to the pollsters that they were prosandinista 
in the privacy of the voting booth they abandoned ortega 
one of the few who was not taken in by the pollsters was the 
chief us diplomat in managua jack leonard who foresaw the 
chamorro victory weeks ago 
the pollsters were no less off base than former assistant 
secretary of state elliott abrams who in an april 1987 speech 
predicted disaster for central america if military aid to the 
contras was cut off 
under abrams scenario an aid suspension would enable the 
sandinistas to devote their attention to subverting other central 
american countries leading to the eventual destruction of the 
fledgling democracies in the region 
to abandon the contras is to follow a recipe for certain 
disaster in the region within two years he said 
abrams grim scenario has not panned out military aid was 
indeed cut off by the congress the date was two years ago this 
week and instead of disaster befalling nicaraguas neighbors it 
befell the sandinistas themselves

managed to wangle an invitation to camp david 
as the leaders posed for pictures in the oval office at the

you must bring me up to camp david sometime 
absolutely replied bush i think if you like the 
outdoors youd love it in the spring and the fall it is 
wonderful 
bush as is his usual practice refused to answer reporters 
questions during the photo opportunity but when a reporter asked 
for haugheys views on german unification bush said this is a 
free country you can ask him anything you want but i dont know 
whether hell answer 
haughey passed up the opportunity to explain his views saying 
i think the best thing i can do is take the good example of the 
president of the united states of america 
but before the reporters and camera crews filed out haughey 
seized the opportunity to make sure the camp david invitation was 
on the record 
are you really going to have me up to camp david sometime 
soon haughey asked again 
yes in front of everybody im answering your question you 
are welcome to come to camp david sometime weve got to do it when 
its a little warmer 
camp david is the presidential retreat in the catoctin mountains 
of maryland 75 miles outside washington bush spends nearly every 
weekend there and spent this past weekend there huddled with west 
german chancellor helmut kohl

opposition leaders demanded 
tuesday that defense minister magnus malan be suspended and 
directed to prove his allegation that an assassinated 
antiapartheid activist was an army spy 
you have besmirched a hero denis worrall coleader of the 
democratic party told malan in parliament not a single black 
person in south africa or namibia believes you 
his party and the larger conservative party which supports 
apartheid want malan suspended until pending a judicial inquiry 
into allegations that the civil cooperation bureau a secret 
military intelligence unit killed opponents of south africas 
apartheid policy of race discrimination 
malan defense minister since 1981 has denied ordering killings 
or other criminal activity more than 60 unsolved killings of 
antiapartheid activists have occurred in the past decade 
south african and namibian police are seeking three former 
police officers who allegedly were recruited into a unit of the 
militarys civil cooperation bureau 
they have been missing since namibian police issued warrants for 
their arrest in the assassination in september 1989 of anton 
lubowski a lawyer who was the highestranking white member of the 
southwest africa peoples organization 
swapo guerrillas fought a bush war against south african forces 
in namibia until april 1989 it won elections in november and will 
control the government when the territory becomes independent in 
march under un supervision 
on monday malan declared in parliament that lubowski was a 
paid agent of military intelligence who had done good work for 
the army and there would have been no reason for the military 
intelligence chief to have ordered action against him 
malan said he would make further comments only to the judicial 
inquiry lubowskis family challenged him to repeat the allegation 
outside the protection of parliamentary privilege 
one of the reasons for this allegation is to create suspicion 
of white swapo members said moses garoeb a swapo official no 
matter the extent of the smear campaign the name of anton lubowski 
will be remembered as a shining example of the struggle for 
independence 
worrall said in parliament given the denial by the lubowski 
family and swapo and the improbability of the suggestion that he 
was a military intelligence agent we are entitled to demand proof 
if the man was paid there must be bank acounts and evidence of 
payments 
if malan did not provide proof of his allegation worrall said 
he would simply be seen to be trying to save his own political 
life 
the star newspaper in johannesburg which has published several 
articles showing the chain of command between malan and the civil 
cooperation bureau said tuesday legal experts were shocked that 
malan had withheld evidence about lubowski from police for five 
months 
col jumbo smit the namibian officer investigating the case 
said whether lubowski worked for the south african army did not 
matter to him this is a murder case he said and the victims 
political affiliation or profession were not relevant 
on sunday the star said president fw de klerk was expected 
to fire malan whom it described as the last remnant of 
expresident pw bothas securocrats 
it noted de klerk had said in a television interview that 
criminals not the security forces were under attack by those 
making allegations about death squads the star said de klerks 
comment appeared directed at statements by malan that implied the 
allegations were an attack on the defense force 
the president however was one of several national party 
members of parliament who shook malans hand after his statement 
monday 
de klerk has drastically reduced the armys power since he 
replaced botha in august he has halved the period of compulsory 
military service cut the defense budget and ended military 
management of black townships

a retired tanker captain suggested 
today that joseph hazelwood could have removed the helmsman of the 
exxon valdez if he doubted the mans capability in steering 
under prosecution questioning robert beevers of grand falls 
wash said a tanker captain rarely can remove a seaman from duty 
without good cause but can shift his assignments on board 
is there a difference between someone qualified to steer and 
someone you would have confidence in in close waters asked 
assistant district attorney brent cole 
oh yes said beevers noting that anyone licensed by the 
coast guard is considerd qualified to steer but in a tricky area 
such as prince william sound he said you would need someone who 
throughout the trip had proved he was capable of steering you 
have to watch closely and decide who is a good helmsman and who is 
not 
some witnesses at hazelwoods trial have blamed the grounding of 
the exxon valdez last march 24 on a helmsman who failed to follow 
commands to turn the ship away from the reef 
beevers was offered as an expert witness on the operations of 
the large ships he said that on any trip the union provides a 
crew but it is up to the skipper to monitor their abilities 
testimony has been inconclusive on whether hazelwood knew that 
the helmsman robert kagan had a history of problems with steering 
hazelwood 43 a veteran seaman from huntington ny is 
charged with seconddegree criminal mischief a felony and three 
misdemeanors reckless endangerment operating a vessel while 
intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil if convicted on all 
counts he could face a maximim of 7 years in prison and 61000 in 
fines 
the exxon valdez spewed nearly 11 million gallons of oil into 
pristine prince william sound killing countless birds fish and 
other wildlife and blackening hundreds of miles of shore 
on monday another expert witness gave jurors a scenario of 
death and destruction that might have followed the skippers 
efforts to free the exxon valdez from a jagged reef 
no one died in the grounding of the 987foot tanker but george 
greiner jr a retired coast guard captain testified that the 
engine room could have been flooded killing crew members below he 
said that hazelwood risked their lives by trying to drive the ship 
off bligh reef 
defense attorneys attacked greiners testimony as inaccurate and 
elicited his concession that the ship was incapable of moving 
anywhere after it struck the reef and unleashed the nations worst 
oil spill 
greiner who spent 33 years in the coast guard is a marine 
safety consultant from ridgefield wash he said the state is 
paying him more than 20000 for his work on the hazelwood case 
he analyzed shipboard recorders of course changes as the vessel 
entered prince william sound in the early morning hours of march 24 
and said it was obvious that after the ship ran aground hazelwood 
tried to extricate it by putting the engines on full maneuvering 
speed 
in records for the time between 1238 am and 141 am he 
said the vessels heading swung back and forth 
the movement of the rudder back and forth is consistent with 
trying to move the vessel off the rock or bottom i can think of no 
other reason for it greiner said under questioning from 
assistant district attorney brent cole 
asked what risks were involved greiner said the risk was 
additional damage to the vessel and possible death or injury to 
people in the engine room he said the ship could be totally 
lost if it came off the reef 
the defense which had contended that hazelwood was trying to 
stablize the ship took a slightly different position monday 
attorney michael chalos suggested that even if hazelwood was trying 
to extricate the vessel it didnt matter because the engine was not 
powerful enough move it the 450 feet required to get off the reef 
do you know how much thrust would have to be generated by the 
engine to move this vessel one inch asked chalos 
no said greiner theres no way to calculate it 
chalos then asked whether after the accident the ship was 
capable of moving even one inch 
obviously it wasnt said greiner it didnt move 
chalos suggested that hazelwoods efforts to extricate the 
tanker from the reef thus meant little in assessing the criminal 
charges against him 
greiner said there was no damage evident from hazelwoods 
postgrounding actions but speculated there might be some damage 
not visible immediately 
would that damage have resulted in any more of a spill 
asked chalos 
in actuality no said greiner

orders to us factories for durable goods 
plunged 105 percent in january the biggest drop in 32 years of 
recordkeeping the government said tuesday in a report raising new 
concerns about widespread weakness in american manufacturing 
while most private analysts maintained the country will avoid a 
recession some were not so sure expressing fears that further 
weakness in manufacturing could lead to more job layoffs sagging 
consumer confidence and cutbacks in consumer spending which 
accounts for twothirds of all economic activity 
and with the fresh signs of slow growth in the first quarter 
analysts were looking for wednesdays commerce department report on 
the gross national product to show the extent of economic 
stagnation in the last three months of 1989 
in its first estimate of the fourth quarter gnp last month the 
department said economic activity slowed to a 05 percent growth 
rate from 3 percent in the third some economists believe the 
octoberdecember growth will be revised downward based on 
information that has become available since the initial estimate 
was made 
i wouldnt rule out a negative growth but i think its 
doubtful said allen sinai chief economist with the boston co 
but even if it is a small negative or a small positive it would 
be the same the economy ground to a halt in the fourth quarter 
many analysts had been looking for a slight improvement in the 
first half of 1990 but some expressed reservations after tuesdays 
durable goods report 
overall it was an indication the manufacturing economy 
definitely is slowing down further said economist thomas 
runiewicz of the wefa group in bala cynwyd pa 
the sharp decline is another sign well see virtually no real 
economic growth in the first quarter concluded jerry jasinowski 
president of the national association of manufacturers 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan sought in congressional 
testimony tuesday to play down the number although he admitted it 
was lower than i would have expected 
greenspan said it was the central banks judgment that orders 
basically are flat 
but paul getman an economist with regional financial associates 
in west chester pa contended 
this is more evidence that the slowdown in growth has not 
passed and we may be just in the middle of it the economys growth 
rate may slow even further in the months ahead 
not all of tuesdays economic reports were bad however the 
commerce department reported that the us trade deficit had 
narrowed to 1132 billion last year the best showing since 1984 
and an 11 percent improvement over 1988 
the report on merchandise trade as calculated on a 
balanceofpayments basis showed a 134 percent gain in exports to 
a record 3619 billion this offset a 64 percent increase in 
imports which also hit an alltime high at 4751 billion 
but in its other report the department said orders for durable 
goods items expected to last more than three years fell to 
1182 billion after having risen 14 percent in december and 48 
percent a month earlier 
it was the steepest decline since the government began keeping 
records of orders in 1958 and broke the previous record drop of 92 
percent set in february 1982 during the last recession 
most of the decline was in transportation the commerce 
department said with aircraft accounting for about half of the 
decrease in that sector analysts had noted an unusually large 
number of aircraft orders in the previous two months and said the 
january drop represented a return to normal 
but motor vehicle orders also were down sharply as automakers 
laid off tens of thousands of workers in january to pare bloated 
inventories the auto industry has been among the weakest in the 
manufacturing sector recently 
overall transportation orders were down 276 percent to 279 
billion after having gained 48 percent in december and 108 
percent in november excluding transportation orders would have 
been off 34 percent 
electrical machinery orders were off sharply down 176 percent 
to 188 billion after having risen 56 percent in decmeber and 
73 percent a month earlier 
defense capital goods orders were down 36 percent to 63 
billion due to government cutbacks in military spending excluding 
defense orders were down 84 percent 
the closely watched nondefense capital goods sector often a 
barometer of business investment plans also fell down 137 
percent and reversing decembers 142 percent gain 
nonelectrical machinery and primary metals orders both rose 
slightly nonelectrical machinery orders were up 26 percent to 
223 billion while primary metals increased 15 percent to 111 
billion

hezbollah group some western hostages are believed held by 
factions linked to hezbollah 
fitzwater said the administration continues to pursue leads and 
contacts that might glean information about potential release of 
the hostages but he would not reveal what they were 
fitzwater talked around the question of whether president bush 
had authorized any officials to conduct talks on the hostages 
except to say there were no talks between the us emissaries and 
iran 
there are no direct talks between the united states and iran 
authorized by the president he said 
i dont know whos talking to who the spokesman saidbut 
i guarantee you im never going to say that nobodys talking

i will never rule out meetings anywhere anyplace anytime by 
anybody on the hostage question because there are meetings 
happening but highlevel us officials direct secret talks no 
do i expect a breakthrough or anything new happening no 
fitzwater said the administration knows of no new evidence 
to support hopes that the hostages release might be forthcoming 
last month a kuwaiti newspaper alqabas said an american 
personality had met in geneva with a representative of iranian 
president hashemi rafsanjani to discuss the hostage issue none of 
those supposedly involved was identified

baby when she was shot the baby was not harmed 
ms petersons killers believed to be drug dealers allegedly 
were retaliating for a shooting committed by her son earlier that 
day 
a spokesman for the queens district attorney said it was not 
definite that shelton would have testified against four young men

a 12yearold boy who got lost in the snowy woods 
was rescued nine hours later along with his labrador retriever who 
helped keep him alive by huddling against him and licking his face 
the dog shadow was lying across the lap of greg holzworth when 
rescuers reached them early monday 
searchers found them by following the sound of the dogs barking 
it was sort of like scary the sixthgrader said in a 
telephone interview from school tuesday 
everything looked the same it was like we were walking around 
in circles my pants got frozen because i had to walk through these 
puddles 
gregs adventure began a little before 4 pm sunday when he and 
shadow set off for a walk in the thick swampy woods that line his 
familys home in raynham 30 miles south of boston 
greg said he intended to take a short walk with shadow who 
joined the family nine years ago when he was a puppy greg was 
wearing a denim jacket missing buttons over a tshirt and cotton 
pants and gloves 
but the two ventured farther in the woods than planned greg 
started building a fort of brush and tree limbs heard shadow 
barking and followed the dog even farther into the woods 
greg realized he was in trouble when falling snow began covering 
his tracks it had snowed most of the day the end of a storm that 
dumped about 8 inches on the region the temperature dropped to 10 
degrees 
shadow lay down next to me and he kept his head on my legs and 
hed lick me in the face greg said he kept me warm 
raynham police officer thomas smith said the dogs body heat 
helped keep the boy alive 
gregs father donald started searching for his son around 6 
pm when he hadnt returned an hour later his wife donna called 
police greg is the younger of their two sons 
more than 100 people including police and firefighters using 
megaphones and sirens combed the woods 
i cant tell you how thrilled i was to have so many people 
help us mrs holzworth said tuesday 
gregs memories are a little hazy for one he thought it was 
only about dinnertime not 1 am when he was actually found 
i was laying down because i was cold and i could barely walk 
because my pants wouldnt bend he recalled after a while my 
legs started hurting and they got wicked sore i could hear people 
yelling i couldnt really yell back because my throat was sore and 
i had chapped lips 
they were found just a half mile from home 
greg was treated at a hospital for exposure 
shadow was rewarded with a full day inside the house monday

here is a roundup of editorials on violeta chamorros election 
victory over marxist sandinista leader daniel ortega in nicaragua 
most of all mrs chamorro has to rely on the understanding 
and generosity of a government in washington that has all but sent 
nicaragua to its deathbed to scourge it of marxism in the process 
30000 nicaraguans have lost their lives and untold others have 
been maimed fallen prey to disease or suffered privation they 
have paid fearfully for us insistence on ideological orthodoxy 
and now president bush must move beyond the mere retraction of our 
sanctions and internationalloan blackball to a trade and aid 
program that welcomes nicaragua wholeheartedly back into the 
hemispheric fold the atlanta constitution 
</TEXT>

in fairness though the defeated president daniel ortega and 
his sandinista associates must be accorded a full measure of 
recognition for having held what was universally conceded to be a 
fair election and for having committed themselves to abide by the 
results ortegas reaction to the voters verdict reflected 
political and personal maturity it may also have indicated a 
recognition that there just isnt much of a market these days for

a determined and at times angry mikhail s 
gorbachev on tuesday rammed through the soviet legislature his 
proposal for a more powerful presidency that progressive lawmakers 
warned could become a dictatorship 
gorbachev his voice rising as his temper frayed accused his 
critics of engaging in cheap demagoguery the soviet leader 
recognized lawmakers and revoked their right to speak apparently at 
whim during the oftenstormy debate 
he hailed the supreme soviets final and overwhelming approval 
of his proposal as a a great political event but lawmaker 
leonid sukhov a ukrainian taxi driver warned the way the 
voting went today is the same way presidential power will be 
after only two days of discussion spread over two weeks the 
supreme soviet voted 34724 with 43 abstentions to approve creation 
in principle of a national presidency with a fiveyear term to 
replace the government post now held by gorbachev whose formal 
title is supreme soviet chairman 
the bill was remanded to committees to consider the dozens of 
amendments offered by deputies during debate 
subject to final approval by the legislatures parent body the 
congress of peoples deputies the president will be granted powers 
to veto laws unilaterally declare states of emergency and name 
the prime minister according to a copy of the bill shown to 
western reporters 
gorbachev who chaired the legislatures proceedings emphasized 
he has not yet been elected president and said he has even 
considered refusing the office but few expect the 58yearold 
communist party chief not to be chosen 
the presidency would give gorbachev a new and stable power base 
at a time when his 20 millionmember partys popularity and 
prestige are waning and it pursues the declared aim of following 
east europes communist parties in renouncing its legally 
guaranteed right to govern and compete in a multiparty system 
progressive lawmakers strongly objected to concentrating so much 
power in one leaders hands and what they called gorbachevs undue 
haste in pressing the issue on the supreme soviet but other 
legislators said mounting economic social and ethnic woes prove 
the need for a strong leader 
we are tired of social tension when are you going to put the 
country in order lawmaker rano a ubaidullaeva of uzbekistan 
said her constituents were demanding we need a person who can 
have real power the quicker the better 
but anatoly a sobchak rejected the demand for a strong hand 
voiced by some we are deciding the question of appointing a 
nationwide gendarme the leningrad jurist said he told the 
542member legislature all our decisions can be crossed out by 
the president 
sobchak and another member of the progressive interregional 
group of parliamentarians sergei stankevich of moscow said the 
new presidency would tilt the balance of power toward the head of 
state to the detriment of the new working legislature which has 
functioned for less than a year 
we know all too well from the history of our country how 
dangerous is the concentration and superconcentration of power and 
authority in one place said stankevich who has studied the us 
constitution 
visibly stung by some lawmakers insinuations that the new 
office was being tailormade for him gorbachev exclaimed from the 
dais this is not serious this is cheap demagoguery 
were talking about the presidents power about 
constitutional changes he said what does gorbachev have to do 
with this 
he repeated previous assurances that there would be more than 
one candidate for the office and added sometimes i have an 
outrageous thought in order to prove that this the political 
system is not being adjusted for somebody to decline if my 
name is on the list of candidates 
but he said such an act would be cowardice the new 
presidency he said was vital for the success of his economic and 
social reform drive known as perestroika 
according to the draft bill on the presidency shown to 
reporters the holder of the office must be a soviet citizen at 
least 35 years old the president will be directly elected by the 
voters the bill stipulates but the jurist who presented it to the 
supreme soviet said the procedure will be different the first time 
vladimir kudryavtsev a vice president of the academy of 
sciences said the first president will be elected by the congress 
to a fouryear term because it would take too long to prepare a 
nationwide election the presidents term would thus expire along 
with those of the 2250 members of the congress who were elected 
last year 
the bill shown to reporters empowers the president 
to unilaterally declare a state of emergency anywhere in the 
country and to declare war if the soviet union is invaded 
to appoint the prime minister subject to confirmation by the 
supreme soviet 
to be commanderinchief of the armed forces 
to veto legislation if the supreme soviet overrides the veto 
by a majority vote the president can appeal to the congress or go 
over the heads of the lawmakers by scheduling a nationwide 
referendum 
on gorbachevs recommendation the supreme soviet voted to 
convene an extraordinary session of the congress on march 12 to 
approve the constitutional changes creating the new office and 
elect the president 
after the supreme soviet adjourned for the day interregional 
group members caucused in a kremlin sideroom dominated by a 
painting of soviet founder vladimir lenin haranguing a crowd on red 
square 
its awful historian yuri n afanasyev said of the 
legislatures proceedings it shows there are around 300 people 
in the supreme soviet who simply do what gorbachev wants

john c lawn will retire as head of the drug 
enforcement administration next month after five tumultuous years 
when drugs and related violence commanded the attention of the 
american people 
lawn whose retirement was announced tuesday took over the 
agency in 1985 just as mexican authorities were discovering the 
bodies of slain dea agent enrique kiki camarena and his mexican 
pilot alfredo zavala avelar 
lawns role in pressuring mexican officials to pursue those 
behind the kidnaptortureslaying of the two was portrayed last 
month in a television miniseries called drug wars the camarena 
story 
in an interview in december lawn gave no hint that he might be 
retiring this year as head of the lead federal agency for drug law 
enforcement 
when asked how long he would like to keep his job lawn said 
until i become tired of it 
he acknowledged that the job was frustrating and 
challenging and added some point in time will come that ill 
have to turn over the reins but i dont know when thatll be 
one reason behind the decision to retire after 27 years of 
government service is that he will turn 55 in a few months said 
dea spokesman frank shults 
while lawn as a presidential appointee is exempt from the 
mandatory retirement age of 55 imposed on other federal law 
enforcement officers he would not be able to maintain his 
position as a law enforcement officer just an administrator 
shults said its extremely important to him that he is a 
special agent thats his motivation 
theres no suggestion that hes giving up the war on drugs 
shults said hes very torn it was an extremely difficult 
decision for him to make 
in a letter to president bush announcing his intention to retire 
march 23 lawn said my service as administrator of dea over the 
past five years has been most rewarding and most satisfying the 
ratification of the united nations convention the national drug 
control strategy and the cartagena summit have established the 
foundations upon which we can project with confidence our ultimate 
success in this battle 
lawn also thanked bush for your personal involvement in 
honoring those dea special agents who have paid the ultimate price 
in this battle saying that action combined with support for the 
agents families have special significance for the men and women 
of the drug enforcement administration and for me 
in the december interview lawn said the toughest part of his 
job was the loss of personnel such as camarena he also expressed 
disappointment with the size of the drug war budget contrasting 
the 95 billion budget for 1990 to the excess of 30 billion a 
year the united states spent for the vietnam war 
to have fewer agents than there are musicians in the united 
states army or to have fewer agents than there are new york city 
transit police you get a sense of too few people being asked to 
face a herculean challenge lawn said 
just as lawn is leaving the bush administration has requested a 
budget of 106 billion for the war on drugs in 1991 a sum that 
would boost deas share from 6169 million this year to 7913 
million next year enough to add several hundred new agents to the 
current complement of 3191 when lawn took over the job in 1985 
the dea budget was 3538 million 
lawn who was born in brooklyn ny plans to return to new 
york city for a job in the private sector said shults who did not 
give details of lawns new job 
jack lawn has provided extraordinary leadership to the drug 
enforcement administration during an extremely challenging time 
attorney general dick thornburgh said in a statement he has been 
a catalyst for leadership in the international law enforcement 
community helping to unite the drugfighting efforts of many 
countries his contributions to the international war on drugs 
will be missed 
lawn a former marine corps officer joined the fbi in 1967 and 
served in savannah ga monterey calif kansas city mo san 
antonio texas and at fbi headquarters before he became acting 
deputy administrator of dea in 1982 
president reagan nominated lawn to the top dea job in 1985 to 
replace francis m mullen who had retired

a draft law setting out a daunting procedure for a 
republic to secede from the soviet union has been submitted to the 
national legislature a news service of radio moscow reported on 
tuesday 
calls for secession from the soviet union are strongest in the 
baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia which were 
absorbed by the soviet union during world war ii 
the soviet communist party recently pledged to support 
legislation establishing a procedure by which republics could 
legally secede from the union 
but the law appeared certain to displease independent political 
leaders in the baltics who argue that soviet political control of 
their nations is not legitimate 
according to the report published by interfax a recently 
introduced news service of radio moscow the question of secession 
can be decided only after a referendum in the republic that wishes 
to secede 
the parliament of the republic or at least onethird of the 
adult population of the republic can call for a referendum in which 
threefourths of the adult must vote for the results to be valid 
the report said 
according to the draft the results of the referendum will then 
be submitted to the supreme soviet and the congress of peoples 
deputies the twotiered legislative system that will make a 
preliminary decision on the basis of domestic and foreign 
consequences of secession 
any secession would take place over a minimum of five years 
until the final decision on separation is taken that power rests 
in the hands of the 2250member congress twothirds of the 
deputies must approve the secession 
during the transition phase defense and security issues as well 
as the establishment of a new border would be settled after which 
the governments of the republic that has decided to secede and 
other soviet republics would settle financial and property issues 
the seceding republic has the right to lease or buy any property 
belonging to the soviet union as a whole or the property can be 
returned 
a spokeswoman for sajudis the lithuanian popular front said 
the movements leaders were meeting tuesday night and could not be 
reached for comment 
sajudis claimed a landslide victory in elections to the 
lithuanian parliament held saturday and is determined to press 
forward with its primary demand for the republics independence and 
sovereignty 
secessionist sentiment is strongest in lithuania where native 
lithuanians make up 80 percent of the population while in 
neighboring latvia for example the policy of russification has 
reduced the native population to about 50 percent 
even some russians living in latvia say secession and an 
independent latvia would be desirable because of the expected 
economic benefits labor productivity and quality of goods is 
higher in the baltics than in other republics

a major lowincome housing landlord suspended 
by the department of housing and urban development told congress on 
tuesday that hud footdragging and negligence greatly contributed to 
poor conditions at properties cited in the sanctions 
huds administration and oversight of innercity problem 
housing has been abysmal and verges on the criminal a bruce 
rozet told a house banking subcommittee which in turn told rozet 
it planned to call hud officials and tenants to discuss conditions 
and management of the properties 
rozet whose californiabased companies control to varying 
degrees some 45000 subsidized housing units in 40 states and 
puerto rico accused hud of reneging on several promises to help 
his company revitalize troubled properties it acquired three years 
ago 
while most of his allegations dealt with hud actions taken 
during the reagan administration rozet said current hud secretary 
jack kemp who suspended the rozet companies last month has added 
only rhetoric to the nations housing woes 
they have condemned tenants to live in squalor while pleading 
the poverty of the government and trying to shift the blame 
rozet said they have raised the hopes of poor innercity 
residents with rhetoric and promises of action and then dashed 
their hopes on the anvil of purported reform and miserly budgets 
hud general counsel francis keating termed rozets accusations 
silly irrational and untrue he said the rozetled investors 
had realized handsome returns and should put more of their 
money into the projects before seeking additional government funds 
his view was always write me another check keating said 
it should be the responsibility of the owner to keep up the 
property not the responsibility of the taxpayer 
the subcommittee chairman rep henry b gonzalez dtexas told 
rozet he would be called to testify again after the panel hears 
from hud officials about properties managed by rozets associated 
financial corp and its web of 40 affiliates 
while placing no blame on rozet gonzalez said he disagreed with 
government policies that allow private investors such as rozets 
groups to reap lucrative tax benefits from comparatively small 
investments in lowincome housing 
kemp has attacked rozets and other groups saying they often 
allow properties to decay and refuse to put money back into them 
rozet in turn has argued that his groups have a strong record of 
reinvesting but often have been turned away by hud when they 
propose renovation plans 
gonzalez said he wanted to hear from hud officials to determine 
to what extent the agencys hands were dirtied he told rozet 
im not too sure about yours 
rozet has said the suspension which prohibits his companies 
from new hudrelated work has forced him to seek to transfer most 
of the 350 properties in his portfolio he has vowed to fight hud 
in court and for the last month has been engaged in essentially a 
battle of accusations with the agency 
kemp had four aides at tuesdays hearing several times one 
scribbled down questions and had them delivered to republican 
subcommittee members 
rozet said he would gladly testify again and predicted the 
subcommittees review would support his contention that the poor 
conditions at the properties cited in the suspension were 
aggravated by hud denials or delays when acting on renovation 
proposals 
the one thing hud cannot do and congress cannot let them do 
is to make no decision and turn their back on the problem 
rozet said 
the suspension alleges an afc management affiliate misused 
government and tenants money at developments in oklahoma and the 
district of columbia rozet submitted reams of documents to the 
panel that he said proved his companies had done nothing wrong and 
said they would prove that if hud would grant them a hearing 
at one point in his attempt to turn the tables on hud rozet a 
democratic party fundraiser said perhaps none of his properties 
would be troubled had he hired a republican consultant to lobby hud 
for the proposals that were rejected 
that was a reference to influencepeddling at hud during the 
reagan years the subject of extensive congressional hearings last 
year and a senate hearing even as rozet spoke to the house 
subcommittee

democrats accused president bush on tuesday of 
being unwilling to provide the resources to upgrade the nations 
schools in line with the ambitious goals outlined by the president 
and endorsed by the nations governors 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash told the closing session 
of the annual midwinter meeting of the national governors 
association that bush had proposed a meager 2 percent increase in 
the federal spending on education 
democratic gov cecil andrus of idaho characterized as 
malarky the presidents pledge of support during a white house 
meeting with the governors on monday 
andrus said that when bush was asked what support he could 
provide he said we will come out and stand behind you and beside 
you as you tell your people they must increase the local property 
taxes 
if he provides the rhetoric and we have to provide the 
resources theres no way that we can meet the goals that hes 
outlining andrus said 
gov terry branstad of iowa a republican who is chairman of the 
nga said the federal government has a relatively limited role 
in providing financial support for education 
he said the government provides only about 7 percent of the 
money for public schools and that its principal responsibility was 
to help disadvantaged children with such programs as head start 
money isnt the total answer said branstad he said the 
governors planned to issue an annual report card on the progress 
being made to achieve such goals as increasing the high school 
graduation rate to at least 90 percent and creating drug free 
schools 
foley addressed the governors at the closing session of the 
fourday midwinter meeting 
while i commend the president for his desire to be known as 
the education president i question whether he can achieve that 
goal by proposing a meager 2 percent increase in the federal 
spending on education he told the governors 
the simple fact is we dont have a 2 percent education problem 
in this country he said the education gap is much more 
daunting 
he characterized the presidents proposal for education as a 
tepid incrementalism and said we need bolder action 
foley also told the governors they were living in astonishing 
times that were seeing an end to the cold war and victories for 
freedom from eastern europe to nicaragua 
he said those changes would result in a peace dividend as the 
united states was able to cut defense spending in real terms not 
just reduce the rate of growth as has been the pattern in recent 
years such a real cut ought to be possible within five years he 
said 
foley endorsed the view expressed by the governors that whatever 
peace dividend is realized from the reduced spending about 
half should go to reducing the federal budget deficit and half to 
social needs including education 
we will not want however for places to spend this money

katell roc a regional mineral water 
bottled and sold in western france went out of business tuesday 
after reports that its water was contaminated with hydrocarbons 
water quality problems for the small bottler which employed 35 
people at its spring and plant at lizio in britanny arose about 
the same time traces of benzene were found in perrier sparkling 
water 
the plant closure came as the governments consumer watchdog 
agency the national institute of consumption called for labels on 
all mineral water to bear the date it was bottled 
the perrier experience showed the negative effects and 
legitimate suspicion that can follow in case of an accident when 
there is no clear bottling date the agency said 
katell roc president pierre mignot suspended work at the plant 
feb 8 a day after perrier issued its global recall there were 
reports that contaminated katell roc water had ended up in a baby 
bottle 
katell roc recalled 1 million bottles and ran tests on samples 
to check purity and restore consumer confidence mignot said but 
traces of hydrocarbons were found in the bottles spring and pipes 
chlorine also was found in the pipes 
the widespread contamination meant the company could not return 
to production said mignot without specifying the nature of the 
hydrocarbons or how much money the company had lost 
our financial situation is untenable we are only a small 
company mignot said the katell roc brand no longer exists 
the discovery by a us laboratory that forced source perrier sa 
to recall 160 million bottles of its popular brand from 120 
countries on feb 7 has led to greater scrutiny of bottled water 
last week the vittel mineral water concern recalled 1 million 
to 2 million bottles of its domestic hepar brand after reports that 
some had been contaminated with the hydrocarbon alkane 
the company already had quietly withdrawn the contaminated water 
from the shelves but issued a public general recall of new bottles 
to end confusion among consumers executives said 
the consumer agency said it had tested 27 mineral waters since 
the perrier recall two weeks ago and said only perrier showed 
traces of benzene or other chemicals above european standards it 
said the results should restore public confidence in spring water 
and bottled mineral water 
the withdrawal has been voluntary in france with the decision 
left to distributors and shops whether to pull the pearshaped 
green bottles off shelves

two federal agencies announced tuesday they 
were joining forces in an effort to rid their lands of booby traps 
set by marijuana growers to protect their crops 
we dont like people doing their dirty work on our public 
lands interior secretary manuel lujan said tuesday as he and 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter signed an agreement allowing 
law enforcement agents of each department to work on each others 
lands 
with this agreement were sending a stronger message that 
says to them stay out of our lands lujan said during the 
signing ceremony 
william j bennett the national drug control policy director 
joined the ceremony saying he became personally interested in the 
problem of drugs grown on public lands when a book he was reading 
on oregon hiking trails included the warning dont go off the 
trail because you might walk into traps booby traps set by 
marijuana growers 
the interior department controls about 500 million acres while 
the agriculture departments forest service controls almost 200 
million acres about onethird of the land in the united states 
lujan said his department confiscated about 310000 marijuana 
plants last year while yeutter said his department eradicated 
350000 to 400000 plants 
the thrust of the agreement is to do it better yeutter 
said by working cooperatively he said the government will get 
more bang for the buck 
bennett said that at the cartegena colombia drug summit with 
the leaders of colombia peru bolivia and the united states two 
weeks ago we understood it was our responsibility to take care 
of our own domestic drug problem 
the national drug control strategy released jan 25 calls for 
almost doubling the funds for eradication of domestic marijuana 
production to 35 million in 1991

leftist guerrilla leaders 
tuesday deplored the electoral overthrow of their sandinista allies 
in nicaragua and vowed to fight on to achieve genuine democracy 
in el salvador 
the rebels also called for a renewal of talks to end el 
salvadors decadeold civil war 
we certainly deplore the adverse result obtained in these 
elections by the sandinista national liberation front which 
nevertheless has emerged as the single most important individual 
and influential force in nicaragua the guerrillas said in a 
communique broadcast by their clandestine radio venceremos 
it said the sandinistas were undoubtedly the principal 
guarantee for the development of democracy and greater social 
justice and popular participation in nicaragua today 
us and salvadoran officials long have accused nicaraguas 
leftist sandinistas of smuggling weapons to the salvadoran 
guerrillas fighting for power against a succession of 
ussupported governments in the past decade 
the sandinistas repeatedly denied the accusations claiming they 
provided only moral support to the farabundo marti national 
liberation front as the coalition of five salvadoran guerrillas 
groups is known 
but two days before sundays election in nicaragua the new york 
times quoted president daniel ortega as saying that if he was 
reelected his sandinista government would not provide salvadoran 
guerrillas with arms 
in the interview ortega was quoted as saying there was no 
military solution to the civil war in el salvador and he promised 
to adhere to various agreements preventing the flow of illegal arms 
across borders in central america 
in their statement tuesday the guerrillas leaders vowed that 
despite the setback in nicaragua we will redouble our struggle 
to conquer an authentic democracy in el salvador for which so much 
blood has been shed by our people 
an estimated 73000 people have been killed since the civil war 
began in october 1979 according to human rights groups 
the salvadoran guerrilla leaders also called for a renewal of 
peace talks and urged both the united states and president alfredo 
cristianis rightist government not to obstruct any further 
negotiations that can lead us to a regime of democracy social 
justice and lasting peace 
repeated attempts to negotiate an end to the war since 1984 have 
failed the last effort was called off in midnovember after the 
rebels launched an monthlong offensive in san salvador that left 
an estimated 1000 dead 
the rebels said the nicaraguan election was clean and honest 
saying it reflected well on ortega as revolutionaries we are 
proud of the honesty the responsibility and the vision of the 
future our sandinista brothers have it said

frustrated by low pay and crowded classrooms 
eightyfour percent of the 16000 rankandfile members of the 
utah education association voted not to walk off the job at the 
states 800 public and vocational schools in dissatisfaction with 
the legislative appropriation passed last wednesday 
but the associations president jim campbell under fire from 
some teachers for his handling of the negotiations said it would 
be wrong to interpret the vote as an endorsement of the funding 
plan 
the package was not everything we asked for and the 
frustration is still high among teachers more concerned about 
class sizes than salaries campbell said 
utahs 20000 teachers rank 44th in the nation in pay with an 
annual average salary of 22621 and the states teacherstudent 
ratio of 254 to 1 is the nations highest it spends an average of 
2026 per student each year a nationwide low 
the associations board of directors chided republican gov norm 
bangerter and the republicandominated legislature for having 
passed a 38 million tax cut last september instead of giving the 
money to public education 
the appropriation package which passed by onevote majorities 
in both chambers last week contains 1000 pay raises for all 
teachers and a 4 percent boost in state subsidies to local school 
districts 
it also authorizes local school boards to boost property taxes 
to reduce class sizes the money could be used for other purposes 
including teacher salaries if a board certifies it is not needed 
for classsize reduction 
the education association board endorsed the package last week 
at the end of the legislative session but did not lift the 
strike alert order issued a week before 
the teachers voted feb 16 to give authorize the board to call a 
strike the next day the board rejected the education package 
although board members said they wanted to continue talking with 
political leaders 
on feb 19 thousands of teachers staged a capitol hill rally 
reiterating their demands for additional education spending 
the teachers union never made specific demands of the 
legislature but did suggest repealing the 38 million tax cut 
democrats in the legislature also preferred repealing the tax cut 
to the optional property tax hike

raging seas whipped up by a storm that has 
killed 51 people in europe surged through a shattered sea wall and 
swamped homes in this coastal village tuesday 
rescue workers wearing rubber wet suits and traveling in 
flatbottom boats helped evacuate 2000 residents stranded by water 
five feet deep 
twentyfive people were hospitalized for treatment of 
hypothermia and some people who ventured out to retrieve 
belongings from their homes had to be rescued by helicopter as the 
tide rose along the north coast of wales 
the storm knocked a hole 2000 feet long in the centuryold sea 
wall 
we knew about the galeforce winds and high tides and did 
what we could by way of sandbagging but we could not have prepared 
for a breach of this magnitude said neville gough colwyn 
borough director of housing and technical services 
fiftyone deaths have been reported in europe since the storm 
struck monday 16 in britain 12 in west germany and three in east 
germany 10 in france five in belgium two in switzerland and one 
each in ireland italy and the netherlands 
in the north of britain driving snow and 120 mph winds hampered 
efforts to reach an injured climber later found dead in his 
survival bag 
the weather forced the cancellation of the parade of decorative 
floats at the mardi gras celebration in nice france and a 
fireworks show set for tuesday night was canceled because of the 
fire danger from sparks born by the high winds 
residents of towyn might have to stay out of their homes through 
the weekend said don norris the areas emergency planning officer 
throughout britain volunteers and rescuers faced similar 
perils exacerbated by power outages affecting 40000 homes road 
and rail disruptions and fears of sewage contamination and gas 
leaks caused by damaged pipes 
in kent southeastern england houses facing the sea were 
battered by waves that slammed pebbles against windows 
there was a lot of noise and thumping and that we were 
already upstairs because the house was shaking from time to time 
with the stones an unidentified man told bbc radio we heard a 
lot of clatter and then there was an exceptionally great bang and 
all the lights went out 
rain brought by the storm prompted the french secretary of state 
for the environment to issue new flood warnings in alreadysoaked 
east and central france where floods last week caused pollution in 
certain ground water supplies environment officials reported that 
the seine was overflowing its banks near rouen but no damage was 
reported 
in corsica 125 miles off france in the mediterranean sea winds 
clocked at 100 mph caused several fires to spread destroying at 
least 30 homes and threatening a primary school and a retirement 
village 
the association of british insurers estimated weather damage the 
past five weeks including a jan 25 storm at 42 billion the 
earlier storm was blamed for 95 deaths in europe 
french and british meteorologists predicted continued high winds 
gusting up to 75 mph and further high tides wednesday 
hubert lamb a climate researcher at the university of east 
anglia said britains worst storms have come in the last years of 
each century he said the present cycle could be comparable to the 
1790s when one storm produced winds of up to 170 mph

the world banks board including the united 
states unanimously approved a 60 million loan to china on 
tuesday the first of seven loans that bank president barber b 
conable held back after the crackdown on the prodemocracy movement 
last june 
conable said after the decision that the bank is now back to 
regular lending to china the bank is the largest single source of 
aid to the third world lending over 21 billion a year and china 
and india are its biggest borrowers 
you know china has slowed up its reform program for some very 
good reasons and the loans now have to be reviewed conable told 
reporters 
he has taken the position that world bank loans to china are 
based only on economic considerations the suspension last june was 
to make sure that the chinese government could fulfill its 
financial obligations he said 
he added that the bank will be taking up some new loans to china 
as well as the old ones which were to have totaled 820 million 
the one approved tuesday will be repayable in 40 years with less 
than 1 percent annual interest for 10 years only the interest 
need be paid 
the money will go to help farming in jiangxi province the 
northeastern part of the country the bank made another loan to 
china earlier this month to help repair damage from an earthquake 
that occurred after the political crackdown 
the united states is the biggest contributor but has no direct 
veto over loans by the bank which gets most of its money by 
floating bonds on world markets it announced a bond issue on 
tuesday for 50 billion japanese yen 3357 million 
after conable held back the loans to china last june president 
bush asked that lending be suspended since then the united states 
has resumed its own loans to china and has made a grant to help 
american firms meet competition for material to be used on the 
shanghai subway

the united states is offering too little aid 
to eastern europe while us businesses are losing out to japan and 
western europe on the chance to cash in on a potentially lucrative 
new market three experts on the region said tuesday 
we almost have a stealth policy toward the region said ed 
hewett a senior fellow at the brookings institution comparing 
bush administration activity to the bomber designed to elude 
detection its hard to find it some days 
the united states has abdicated any leadership role in eastern 
europe by failing to put in the money needed to assure successful 
transition to freemarket economies said william e griffith a 
political scientist at the massachusetts institute of technology 
until more is done we cannot expect to be taken anywhere 
nearly as seriously as we once were either in eastern europe or 
more importantly in western europe or japan griffith told the 
house appropriations subcommittee that handles foreign aid 
it will be up to congress to boost the us share of aid to 
emerging democracies such as poland hungary and czechoslovakia 
griffith said because the bush administration has proven reluctant 
to provide adequate cash 
hewett agreed if we nickel and dime the problem now we 
will live to regret it he said 
harvard economist jeffrey sachs who is working as an adviser to 
the polish goverment said while the japanese and europeans are 
swarming over the area to mine new business opportunities the 
us business presence is hardly to be seen 
japanese businesspeople are all over europe putting enormous 
resources into study analysis contacts they realize it could 
be an extraordinarily profitable export base sachs said 
ive been told they are on a firstname basis with all of the 
chiefs of the largest enterprises in the gdr east germany 
one does wonder where is the united states and why are so many 
businesses ready to cede this very large market to other 
countries 
poland in particular is crucial said griffith if the new 
solidarityled government fails in its effort to transform its 
economy it will discredit the idea and discourage other reformers 
in the region he said it is in my judgment close to essential 
that it not fail 
the united states has won the cold war with the soviets but 
cannot now give up the effort he added it would not only be 
ironic but potentially dangerous if the united states would 
once again have won a war and then gone home griffith said

the director general of unesco urged the west on 
tuesday to provide practical assistance to independent media in 
eastern europe as journalists there report about the emergence of 
new societies 
federico mayor said the fastchanging eastern european press 
needs help to overcome many obstacles identified by visitng 
editors as outmoded equipment shortages of cash and newsprint and 
the need to train a new generation of journalists 
the media are the arteries through which democracy passes the 
means by which people are informed policies questioned twoway 
communication assured political abuses checked provided that the 
media are free independent and diverse mayor said 
the head of the united nations educational scientific and 
cultural organization made his remarks at the opening of a twoday 
conference initiated by western press organizations to address 
media needs in eastern europe 
media leaders from 15 western nations including the united 
states and canada attended the unesco conference along with 
journalists from bulgaria hungary poland east germany romania 
czechoslovakia and the soviet union 
the problems in establishing free and independent media in these 
countries were considerable mayor said particularly when there 
is no historical memory of freedom when the political culture has 
to be acquired from the beginning 
mayor said the west could help in five areas offering advice 
pooling information to avoid duplication providing access to new 
technologies training journalists and establishing permanent 
institutional contacts 
several eastern european speakers appealed for assistance 
we do not have the most elementary practical skill said 
ernest skalski editor of the polish newspaper gazeta we dont 
know how to sell newspapers we dont know about advertising we 
dont have computers i came here to learn how to get help 
miroslav philip editor of the czech weekly reporter magazine 
spoke of the catastrophic backwardness of our equipment we want 
to modernize with the help of our neighbors 
encho gospodinov of the bulgarian publication pogled said many 
new papers in his country could be profitable if they had more 
newsprint he also said they lack hard currency to purchase 
computers and other equipment 
other speakers advocated regional approaches 
we have to come together and understand each other if we are 
not to lose the new freedoms we have the time has come for 
joint publications and joint television programs said vitaly 
korotich editor of the soviet weekly ogonyok

opened in 1978 at narita 40 miles northeast of tokyo 
the government plans to build the terminal and two additional 
runways by the end of march 1991 at an estimated cost of 4 billion 
to cope with existing overcrowding and demands for even more 
flights from the airport 
but eight farmers still live on the planned expansion site and 
refuse to leave

issue for their antigovernment activities have been resisting the 
governments plans to expropriate farmland to expand the airport

prime minister toshiki kaifu newly reelected by 
parliament formed a cabinet wednesday after fighting off attempts 
to include scandaltainted politicians in his administration 
kaifu displayed uncharacteristic assertiveness by weathering 
intense intraparty haggling over appointments that delayed 
announcement of the cabinet for several hours 
he also dropped both women named to his first cabinet formed 
shortly after julys election in which female voters played a major 
role in ousting the ruling liberal democratic party from control of 
the upper house 
but he kept his foreign and finance ministers in what political 
analysts said was a move to preserve continuity in relations with 
the united states at a time of renewed trade friction and maintain 
a steady policy in dealing with a widely unpopular new tax 
the cabinet was to present itself to emperor akihito later 
wednesday before holding its first meeting 
the reshuffling came two days before kaifu was to leave for a 
hastily arranged summit with president bush the twoday meeting 
begins friday and is expected to focus on us calls for japan to 
radically alter the structure of its economy and ease its 49 
billion trade surplus with the united states 
foreign minister taro nakayama and newly named international 
trade and industry minister keibun muto held a news conference to 
address immediately the trade tensions kaifu will face 
japan must maintain good relations with the united states 
nakayama said at a time of japanus economic friction we will 
make strong efforts in the talks we must promote discussions 
for japanus global partnership in the 21st century 
aside from nakayama the only other cabinet holdover was finance 
minister ryutaro hashimoto an ambitious politician widely regarded 
as a future prime minister 
the backstage wrangling followed kaifus reelection tuesday as 
president of the ruling party and thus prime minister 
parliaments lower house which officially names the premier 
voted to keep kaifu 286146 over socialist party chairwoman takako 
doi 
the upper house controlled by the opposition since july voted 
for kaifu 11191 over ms doi with 44 blank ballots in a runoff 
voter outrage over the tax and the farreaching recruit scandal 
led to the liberal democrats trouncing at the polls in july in 
the scandal stocks in a subsidiary of recruit co a business 
information conglomerate were sold to politicians at artificially 
low prices 
the scandal brought down the administration of former prime 
minister noboru takeshita and led to the resignation of his 
successor sousuke uno who stepped down to take responsibility for 
the july election outcome 
but kaifu led the liberal democrats to an unexpectedly wide 
majority in the feb 18 lower house election giving him and his 
party renewed confidence in their leadership 
kaifu lacks a significant power base within the party but 
nevertheless insisted on a clean cabinet he stubbornly 
resisted former finance minister michio watanabes backing of koko 
sato an exagriculture minister and member of watanabes 
intraparty faction 
sato had been given a suspended sentence in a 1970s scandal in 
which lockheed aircraft corp bribed politicians to influence sales 
of its aircraft in japan 
watanabe relented however when cabinet negotiations became 
stalemated kaifu also rebuffed attempts from another party faction 
to include a recruitlinked member in the cabinet 
but kaifus insistence on a recruitfree cabinet could cost him 
heavily said takashi inoguchi a political scientist at tokyo 
university 
kaifus dilemma is that to gain public approval he has to 
assert himself visavis other major bosses inoguchi told kyodo 
news service but unless kaifu incorporates recruittainted 
politicians major bosses may not cooperate with him 
kaifu from a small party faction depends on support from the 
big party bosses takeshita exforeign minister shintaro abe and 
exfinance minister kiichi miyazawa all linked to recruit and 
heads of the three largest factions 
other lawmakers appointed to the cabinet included former 
agriculture minister kabun muto as minister of international trade 
and industry justice minister shin hasegawa labor minister 
shunpei tsukahara construction minister tamisuke watanuki and 
defense agency director general yozo ishikawa

a judge said tuesday he would rule within two 
days on a request to release the passport of dr elizabeth morgan 
to enable her to travel to new zealand to fight a custody lawsuit 
filed by her exhusband 
morgan was jailed in 1987 for more than two years for failing to 
reveal the whereabouts of her daughter hilary now 7 
her passport request was taken under advisement by district of 
columbia superior court judge herbert dixon following a 90 minute 
hearing 
keeping elizabeth morgan a prisoner in her own country wont 
be any more effective than keeping her a prisoner in that little 
cell said her attorney steven sachs 
sachs argued that morgan has fulfilled every obligation 
since her passport was turned over to court authorities in 1987 
it is being unlawfully and illegally held he said 
however john lenahan representing morgans former husband and 
the girls father dr eric foretich argued that returning the 
passport would only give morgan an opportunity to further defy 
the previous contempt of court order 
she has done nothing to purge herself of the contempt 
charge lenahan said 
morgan was jailed in 1987 for 25 months for refusing to turn 
over the girl for supervised visits with foretich morgan has 
contended the girl was sexually abused by foretich he has denied 
the charges and claimed that morgan was mentally ill 
foretich and his wife separated before hilary was born 
the girl who has been living with her maternal grandparents in 
christchurch new zealand had been the subject of a 2year search 
by her father officials found her there last week

president bush congratulated the san francisco 
49ers friday on their stunning 1990 super bowl victory but 
complained the score was so lopsided many viewers tuned out early 
and missed his own tv appearance 
he suggested that a public service message he taped was seen 
only by five people when it aired in the fourth quarter of the 
5510 rout all of them work for me he joked 
the message in which he praised the national football league 
for its charity programs also aired in the first quarter 
the president honored the team at a white house reception and 
called the 49ers defeat of the denver broncos one of the 
greatest victories in american championship history 
you clobbered them the president said 
noting that the team also had won the 1989 super bowl bush 
said your team is carrying into the 90s the title the 
pittsburgh steelers carried into the 70s team of the decade 
to an east room audience that included family members of the 
team and many politicians bush said this last super bowl seemed 
to have been over some time around the end of the national anthem 
bush lavished praise on the winner of the games most valuable 
player award 49ers quarterback joe montana calling him joe 
cool and saying fair to say hes the most accurate passer in 
the nfl never thrown a super bowl interception 
that bush teased was a claim that former buffalo bills 
quarterback jack kemp now bushs secretary of housing and urban 
development and seated in the front row at the reception could 
never make 
team owner eddie debartolo presented the president and his wife 
barbara with a little present for the youngest member of your

the whitemajority city council refused to 
repave martin luther king jr street for the 25th anniversary of 
the selmatomontgomery voting rights march setting off new racial 
tension here 
angry blacks responded by interrupting monday nights council 
meeting forcing a recess after the panel voted 54 along racial 
lines not to repave the street named for the leader of the 1965 
march a reenactment of the 50mile march begins sunday in selma 
and ends march 10 in montgomery 
at the councils previous meeting black council members walked 
out after the panel voted down a proposal to alternate black and 
white majorities on the school board 
the city has been the scene of racial turmoil since december 
when the school board also in a racial split voted against 
renewing the contract of norward roussell the citys first black 
school superintendent his contract expires in june 
blacks and city leaders exchanged words at mondays the council 
meeting with white mayor joe smitherman telling the audience to 
shut up and sit down 
black council member lorenzo harrison proposed that the city 
spend 17000 to resurface martin luther king jr street in his 
district for the march reenactment 
smitherman quoted the city engineer as saying the street 
didnt need it it would just make it look very shiny he said 
each council member had 30000 for ward projects and harrison 
had used it on other streets 
council president carl morgan ordered a recess saying the crowd 
had become too unruly for the council to conduct business 
about 50 to 60 blacks waited for the members to return and 
didnt leave until morgan said the panel would not meet again until 
its next regular session on march 5 
a lot of it is being orchestrated to try to get emphasis 
placed on this 25th anniversary morgan said tuesday of the 
disruption once that period is over the national media will be 
out of the picture the thing is about to fall on its face 
morgan who is white predicted that fewer than 500 of the 
13000 blacks in selma would take part in the march and said black 
leaders have alienated whites 
morgan said the citys racial unrest in recent weeks has been 
bad for business its bad for industry but i think it has done 
more to solidify the white community which is a setback im sorry 
to say for the blacks 
perry varner one of three blacks on the dallas county 
commission said the protesters would keep disrupting the council 
until it does the right thing 
but smitherman said he expects the council will return to a 
peaceful atmosphere as soon as the march gets over

the bush administration savoring the defeat 
of leftist president daniel ortega promised tuesday to lift 
sanctions soon against nicaragua and assemble significant and 
meaningful aid to rebuild its shattered economy 
president bush met at the white house with congressional leaders 
including sen sam nunn dga who said postortega assistance 
probably would cost hundreds of millions of dollars over five years 
nunn suggested creating an emerging democracy account of 
foreign aid for countries such as nicaragua panama and the 
fledgling democracies in eastern europe 
the white house said it liked the idea if it meant the 
administration would have more flexibility in the way the united 
states dispenses foreign aid 
to the surprise of the administration ortega was defeated in 
sundays presidential election by opposition newspaper publisher 
violeta chamorro who was backed by the united states 
the vote sets the stage for the first democratic transfer of 
power ever in nicaragua with mrs chamorro taking office april 25 
from ortegas revolutionary government 
mrs chamorros chief economic adviser francisco mayorga will 
arrive in washington next monday to discuss with us officials 
american economic cooperation with nicaragua assistant secretary 
of state bernard aronson announced 
bush summoned congressional leaders to the white house to chart 
a new strategy for dealing with a country viewed for a decade as a 
us adversary 
the president indicated that there would be a dramatic and 
swift change in policy said sen alan cranston dcalif the 
assistant democratic leader after meeting with bush what we can 
do in terms of aid depends upon what congress can find along with 
the administration in a very tight budget situation 
without providing a figure white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater promised that us assistance would be substantial 
the united states commitment is strong and enduring 
fitzwater said we will develop an aid package for nicaragua that 
will be significant and meaningful the democratic aspirations of 
the nicaraguan people deserve our support and they will have it 
fitzwater said the united states was examining the full range 
of economic options aimed at reintegrating nicaragua into the 
international economy 
he said bush would discuss nicaraguas needs this weekend at a 
meeting with japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu whose country 
has become the worlds largest donor of foreign aid 
nunn also said us aid for emerging democracies should be 
sizable 
after all we spent trillions and trillions of dollars 
hundreds of billions of dollars defending the free world waiting 
for this day and now that weve arrived at this day i think we 
should not be shortsighted in our approach nunn said 
however sen christopher dodd dconn said he was 
frightened again that were watching expectations exceed 
reality on the question of us aid 
i see no political will to enlarge the foreign aid budget 
dodd said rather than emphasizing direct cash aid the united 
states should emphasize trade benefits it can provide by buying 
more coffee and sugar from nicaragua and the reduction of foreign 
debts he said and congress may well pay for part of the new us 
obligation to nicaragua by diverting part of the 500 million in 
cash the bush administration will be seeking to help rebuild 
panamas economy he said 
in a message that seemed primarily aimed at the contra rebels 
long supported by the reagan and bush administrations fitzwater 
urged restraint in the postelection period he reiterated a us 
call that there be an immediate ceasefire under un supervision 
and that it be strictly respected by all sides 
we have always anticipated that the resistance would 
demobilize and repatriate under conditions of political freedom and 
personal security fitzwater said 
in contrast to the skepticism the white house has applied to 
statements by ortega the administration appeared eager to accept 
his promise of a smooth transition of power 
we have the words of president ortega about wanting a peaceful 
and effective transition and we fully expect that to occur 
fitzwater said 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said that 
prior suggestions of sandinista unwillingness to turn over power 
were made in the heat of the campaign and that so far as the 
administration knows no such statements have been made since the 
elections 
fitzwater said the administration would respond to the changes 
in nicaraguas government with a series of steps designed to 
normalize relations 
we intend to lift economic sanctions soon he said 
referring to a series of economic and trade sanctions in place 
since 1985 
fitzwater also said that we would expect to return an 
ambassador there and that we are looking at us economic 
assistance 
although the united states has continued to maintain formal 
diplomatic relations with nicaragua there has not been a us 
ambassador in managua since 1988

the nations pension insurance agency urged 
the supreme court tuesday to leave intact its ability to prevent 
companies from abandoning responsbility for worker benefits 
the high court heard oral arguments in a case seen by the bush 
administration as an important test of the authority of the pension 
benefit guaranty corporation a government corporation that insures 
the pensions of 30 million americans 
at issue is whether ltv steel co will succeed in dumping 
billions of dollars in pension costs onto pbgc 
the court must decide whether pbgc acted properly in ordering 
ltv steel a subsidiary of dallasbased ltv corp to reassume 
responsibility for three pension plans 
the vastly underfunded plans were taken over by the pension 
agency after ltv corp sought protection from creditors under 
chapter 11 bankruptcy laws in 1986 
but pbgc attorney carol connor flowe told the court tuesday that 
the agency sought to turn the plans back to ltv because the 
companys financial conditions improved and because the firm 
entered into a followon arrangement with workers 
under the arrangement ltv and the united steelworkers of 
america agreed that the firm would make up the difference of any 
benefits lost to employees because of the pension terminations the 
idea was that the pbgc would pay basic pension benefits to the 
workers while the ailing firm would kick in supplemental benefits 
400 per month in many cases not covered by the government 
plan 
but flowe said such a followon arrangement represented an 
abuse of the pension insurance program 
under questioning by justice sandra day oconnor about pbgcs 
authority flowe said ltvs followon deal and its improved 
economic state by august 1987 each were independent grounds for 
turning the pension plans back to the company 
congress flowe said provided pbgc with broad powers to restore 
terminated plans in 1974 by passing the employee retirement income 
security act or erisa 
what congress said was that pbgc should make this 
determination flowe said 
at issue she said was pbgcs right to discourage unwarranted 
terminations of pension plans by firms eager to gain a 
competitive advantage 
but ltv attorney lewis b kaden argued that the agencys action 
was at odds with the 1974 federal law which he said was designed 
to protect pensioners rights 
he said pbgc wrongly determined that ltv could afford the 
previously terminated plans 
in order to return all these plans you have to answer the 
fundamental question which is can the company afford it 
kaden said 
if the plans are turned back at least one them would likely 
have to be terminated a second time because it has no assets he 
said 
that kind of pingpong effect could not have been contemplated 
by the drafters of erisa he said 
a federal judge threw out the pbgcs order for restoration of 
the plans and the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld that 
ruling last may 12 
the pbgc already has a more than 1 billion deficit and says the 
ltv claims would more than double that figure 
labor secretary elizabeth dole says the case will have 
farreaching ramifications for the retirement security of workers 
and pensioners across the country 
the court is expected to rule by july 
the case is pbgc vs ltv 89390

an american member of a mysterious hindu 
cult has been held in virtual solitary confinement since her 
detainment last month by the communistgoverned west bengal state 
her lawyer said tuesday 
patricia munday 38 of vermont is not receiving the necessary 
medical treatment according to a petition filed in west bengal 
court by her attorney bholanath sen her hometown was not 
immediately known 
west bengal government does not believe in individual 
liberty the lawyer said 
munday was detained by the west bengal police jan 27 
apparently for her links with a cult called the anand marg or the 
path of bliss the governing communist coalition is opposed to the 
cult 
munday is being held in a private hospital in calcutta the 
capital she is guarded by police and journalists are not allowed 
to see her the petition asks that she be moved to a hospital in 
new delhi 
the habeas corpus petition was filed after the indian supreme 
court on friday ordered the government not to deport her she had 
appealed to the supreme court to secure her release 
habeas corpus requires a person in custody be brought before a 
court it places the burden of proof on those detaining the person 
to justify the action 
ms munday has been kept in virtual solitary confinement 
she needs better medical treatment her injuries are yet to heal 
sen said 
west bengals advocate general naranarayan goopu said there 
was no need for the court to act on the petition because a similar 
writ is pending before the supreme court and will be heard friday 
gooptu denied munday is being held in solitary confinement 
telling the court that police have only restricted her movement 
munday a member of the united nations team that won the 1981 
nobel peace prize for its work with refugees in somalia arrived in 
india from katmandu nepal on a private visit a mob attacked her 
and an associate on jan 26 when they were traveling on a 
motorcycle near the anand marg headquarters in west bengals 
purulia district 
munday suffered head injuries the purulia police instead of 
lodging her complaint detained her the next day she later was 
moved to the hospital in calcutta 
the anand marg says it aims to create a social economic and 
spiritual order that will replace both capitalism and communism it 
claims to have branches worldwide

the district of columbia council on tuesday 
decided to allow elections of a shadow congressional delegation 
to lobby capitol hill for district statehood but declined to 
provide money for the positions 
the action came about one week after a committee voted to 
postpone the elections indefinitely which are scheduled for the 
fall 
the full council has voted three times previously to postpone 
the election of shadow senators and a shadow representative 
after the citys voters approved the lobbying effort in a 1980 
referendum 
the unofficial shadow delegation would have no voting 
rights the concept was first used by officials from the tennessee 
territory prior to its admission to the union in 1796 the groups 
only official duty would be to encourage congress to adopt 
legislation making the nations capital the 51st state 
this is a major victory for us said dee hunter director of 
the rainbow coalitions dc statehood office even without the 
funding right now this will allow the education process of city 
voters and those around the country to begin 
council members said they did not want to include language 
providing public money for the positions out of concern for the 
citys budget problems and fears that congress might block the 
funds when it acts on the dc appropriations bill later this year 
the measure however left open the possibility that money could 
be provided later this month as the the council continues 
deliberations on mayor marion barrys 4 billion budget plan 
barrys budget includes 400000 for the posts 
the council defeated an amendment that would have permanently 
barred the city from using city money to pay for them several 
members said use of private funds remained under consideration 
last fall the senate voted 982 to shift 150000 from a city 
statehood lobbying commission to antidrug programs after sen 
jesse helms rnc criticized the statehood lobbying effort as 
wasteful and irrelevant

us agricultural exports should total 385 
billion this fiscal year up 500 million from estimates made last 
fall the agriculture department said tuesday 
but the new forecast for the fiscal year that began oct 1 still 
represents a 3 percent decline from an eightyear high of 397 
billion in the previous fiscal year the record was 438 billion 
in 1981 
the upward revision from november largely reflected a 
3millionton increase in expected us coarse grain exports the 
report said prospects for foreign coarse grain imports have 
increased and us corn is expected to capture a larger share 
overall exports this fiscal year were forecast at 1485 million 
metric tons up 3 million tons from november and nearly 2 million 
tons more than in 1989 
the decline in value was blamed on lower prices for grains and 
oilseeds which more than offset the larger export volume 
estimates of agricultural imports were raised 500 million to 
215 billion matching last years record 
decembers severe freeze in florida and texas has increased 
prospects for fruit juice and vegetable imports the report said

a judge on tuesday ordered the acquittal of 
a florida social worker accused of failing to report suspected 
abuse in the weeks before a 2yearold boy was fatally punished for 
soiling his pants 
no reasonable jury could reach any other verdict than for 
acquittal polk county judge jesse barber said in ordering 
charges dismissed against social worker kenneth houk 
the child bradley mcgee died from head injuries last july 28 
after being repeatedly thrust headfirst into a toilet for soiling 
his pants authorities said 
houk 39 was the first of three florida department of health 
and rehabilitative services workers to be tried over the childs 
death the misdemeanor charge carried a maximum penalty of 60 days 
in jail 
its over houk said as he left court all i want to do 
now is get back to work and get back to my family 
prosecutors contended houk twice failed to notify the state 
child abuse registry after receiving reports about mcgee the last 
call came only weeks before the child died 
bradleys mother sheryl mcgee coe 21 and stepfather thomas 
coe 22 go on trial this summer in fort lauderdale on charges of 
firstdegree murder and aggravated child abuse 
the child was abandoned at a shopping mall when he was 3 months 
old and lived most of his short life in foster care until the state 
gave him back to his mother and stepfather two months before his 
death 
the judges ruling came two hours into the first day of trial 
before the defense began presenting testimony as soon as the state 
rested its case defense attorney jack wilkins moved for a directed 
verdict 
hopefully this will lead to a different wording of the law 
wilkins said people who work for hrs must be given the 
freedom to make judgment calls 
prosecutors maintained houk got a call in december 1988 that 
mrs coe was unfit because she was drinking and using cocaine 
then a few weeks before bradleys death he received another call 
that mrs coe had forced the child to eat feces as punishment for 
violating potty training the state said 
theresa jacobs a key state witness who originally reported the 
feces complaint told the jury houk had urged her numerous times to 
telephone the child abuse registry when she had something to report 
she said she didnt follow his advice 
he had told me before to call the registry but i never got 
any satisfaction from the registry ms jacobs testified i 
didnt see him eat feces i didnt see the bruises 
caseworker judy ross was called by the state to confirm reports 
that she relayed the feces complaint to houk and that houk failed 
to call the abuse registry as required 
but on the stand she waivered when asked if she even thought 
such a secondhand report warranted a call to the hrs hotline 
i dont think i would know enough at that point to make a 
report she said 
caseworkers margaret barber and shirley duboise also are charged 
with failing to report child abuse ms barber who had been 
assigned the bradley case faces an additional charge of felony 
child abuse which carries a maximum penalty of five years in 
prison

president bush on tuesday reiterated us 
opposition to any plan to shift the germanpolish border as the 
visiting mayor of west berlin criticized west german chancellor 
helmut kohl for not offering poland a similar assurance 
bush told congressional leaders that we have an unequivocal 
position that the borders should remain as they are said sen 
sam nunn dga and one of those who met with the president 
bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president simply 
pointed out that our position is firm and that he made that known 
to chancellor kohl 
bush who met with kohl last weekend told reporters at a joint 
news conference sunday that the united states formally recognizes 
the germanpolish border and under international accords regards 
all european borders as inviolable 
kohl acknowledged polish anxiety on the issue and said nobody 
has any intention of linking the question of national unity with 
changes of existing border but he said he could not speak for a 
new united germany 
the border question will be settled definitely by a 
freelyelected allgerman government and parliament kohl 
told the reporters 
on tuesday bush met with west berlin mayor walter momper who 
later said kohl should have said that he and the federal republic 
wants to guarantee the western borders of poland 
nobody in germany wants to change the borders and 
kohl failed to make that clear said momper a member of the 
liberal social democrat opposition to kohls ruling christian 
democratic party 
nunn agreed 
i am personally disappointed that the chancellor has not been 
clearer in this respect said nunn chairman of the senate armed 
services committee i know there are election considerations in 
west germany but this is a matter of tremendous sensitivity not 
only to the polish people but also to all of europe 
it just makes a lot of people more nervous than they would 
otherwise be added nunn 
the current germanpolish border follows the oder and neisse 
rivers after world war ii polands borders were shifted westward 
with the soviet union incorporating eastern parts of poland and the 
poles taking eastern parts of what was then germany

down in heavy fog authorities said 
reids father made his film debut in 1910 quickly going on to 
become one of the silent movie eras biggest stars his career was 
cut short in 1919 when he was injured in a train crash and became 
addicted to the morphine doctors administered as a pain killer he 
died in 1923 at age 32 
the plane crashed shortly after takeoff from santa monica

animal rights organizations are 
criticizing authorities for issuing an alert that militant animal 
activists may have been involved in the slaying of a veterinary 
school dean 
the whole thing is so preposterous said siriol evans 
spokeswoman for the 280000member people for the ethical treatment 
of animals organization in washington dc 
unfortunately somebody is taking this tragic event and trying 
to turn it into a press opportunity against animal rights she 
said monday 
the knox county sheriffs department alerted law enforcement 
agencies across the country last week through the national crime 
information center computer about rumors that militant animal 
rights activists might be planning to kill a veterinarian school 
dean each month for a year 
the advisory followed the feb 8 slaying of hyram kitchen dean 
of the university of tennessee college of veterinary medicine 
kitchen 57 was gunned down in the driveway of his home by an 
unknown assailant 
lt larry johnson a homicide detective investigating the 
slaying said the alert was based on information that was third 
hand and was unconfirmed by our investigation 
it was intended for law enforcement use only and not aimed at 
frightening veterinary school deans elsewhere or accusing anyone 
unjustly he said 
we put it out for only one reason we didnt want to sit on 
anything johnson said 
the matter has been blown out of context he said the 
proverbial mole hill has turned into the mountain 
but animal rights groups were not appeased 
i think its incredibly irresponsible to name a group of 
people whose philosophy is nonviolent as suspects simply because 
the knox county sheriffs department is stumped said helen 
mitternight of the washingtonbased humane society of the united 
states 
the whole thing seems quite ridiculous because that type of 
action is completely against everything the animal rights movement 
stands for echoed ms evans 
johnson said he heard from some animal rights groups monday 
just the peaceful ones who arent so peaceful right now he 
said adding that because of the flap he worried that my dog 
might bite me when i go home 
johnson said he also talked with law enforcement agencies from 
california to new york i have not come up with any other 
incidents since dr kitchens death or even before dr kitchens 
death that was as violent as this he said 
johnson would not say where the animalrights threat started 
but he mentioned three letters sent to people connected with the 
university since kitchens death authorities have dismissed those 
as the work of pranksters 
local news media also have recalled the controversy that kitchen 
became involved in when the neighboring loudon county commission 
agreed in 1988 to sell pound animals to the university for 
experiments 
kitchen defended the practice as furthering the universitys 
study of human diseases animal rights activists objected saying 
the stray dogs and cats might have become family pets 
nancy howell a spokeswoman for the veterinary school said the 
university stopped buying animals from loudon county and never 
heard another word from animal rights activists 
as far as finding a suspect much less a motive for kitchens 
killing johnson said we have eliminated some possibilities but 
by the same token we have uncovered other possibilities just 
things we are not at liberty to elaborate on

czechoslovakias president suggested tuesday a 
visit to moscow by alexander dubcek the communist party chief 
whose liberal prague spring was crushed by the red army a 
generation before gorbachevs reforms 
in a meeting with soviet lawmakers president vaclav havel said 
it could be part of an exchange of parliamentary delegations with 
the czechoslovak group led by dubcek who now is president of 
parliament 
as communist party chief in 1968 dubcek introduced reforms 
offensive to the kremlin which opposed liberalization until 
mikhail s gorbachev became its leader in 1985 soviet tanks rolled 
into prague in august 
earlier tuesday havel paid homage to human rights activist 
andrei sakharov whom the official news agency tass described as 
one of the few soviets to openly welcome the prague spring and 
denounce the invasion 
dubceks last two official visits to moscow were humiliating 
the first time he was a prisoner days after the invasion and on 
the second two months later he signed an agreement allowing 
soviet troops to stay in his country indefinitely and providing for 
a return to hardline rule 
he was dismissed as party chief in 1969 and languished in 
obscurity until czechoslovakias peaceful revolution broke the 
communist grip on power last fall 
havel met with president gorbachev on monday and said they had 
agreed all 73500 red army soldiers would leave czechoslovakia by 
july 1 1991 and might be gone sooner 
tass said the first train carrying troops and armor out of 
czechoslovakia crossed into the soviet union on tuesday afternoon 
sakharov a fearless campaigner for human rights and reform did 
not live to see havel a playwright scorned and jailed by the 
communists become president of czechoslovakia 
havel went to the grave with sakharovs widow yelena bonner 
and added flowers to mounds of others left by ordinary soviet 
citizens who visit the grave 
after the visit with members of the soviet parliaments foreign 
affairs committee havel walked across red square surrounded by 
security guards to the spot where eight soviet citizens were 
arrested while protesting the invasion aug 25 1968 
he arrived monday three days after returning from meetings in 
the united states with president bush 
tass said gorbachev had accepted an invitation to visit 
czechoslovakia his last visit was in april 1987 when dissidents 
like havel were either constantly harassed or in jail 
on monday havel and gorbachev signed a joint declaration the 
czechoslovak leader said would open the way to a new kind of 
cooperation between the two nations 
it calls for relations to be developed on the basis of 
equality and complete mutual respect for each others state 
sovereignty according to a text carried by tass

a federal judge tuesday fined the antiabortion 
group operation rescue its founder and 10 protesters 450000 for 
violating court orders against blocking entrances to abortion 
clinics 
the contempt fines from us district judge robert ward came in 
a lawsuit filed by prochoice groups over antiabortion 
demonstrations in new york in 1988 and 1989 
in los angeles 15 members of the group were convicted monday 
after a weeklong trial on misdemeanor charges stemming from a 
demonstration at a family planning clinic last march they face up 
to one year in jail and a 1000 fine 
ward said in his ruling that the defendants in new york 
including operation rescue founder randall terry knew what to 
expect when they violated court orders against blocking clinic 
doors 
wendy wright an operation rescue spokeswoman said she had no 
immediate comment on the fines a telephone call tuesday to the 
groups lawyer a lawrence washburn was not returned 
wards ruling stemmed from a lawsuit brought by the national 
organization for women and other abortionrights groups against 
operation rescue and terry 
mary m gundrum a lawyer with the center for constitutional 
rights who worked with now on the lawsuit said the contempt 
actions were pursued to give fair warning to those persons and 
groups that the court will proceed to fine them if they violate the 
constitutional rights of women 
ward fined operation rescue and terry 100000 the remaining 
350000 in fines were against a local chapter of the group and 10 
leaders and participants in demonstrations the judge also ordered 
the defendants pay the plaintiffs attorney fees which had not yet 
been calculated 
terry and four others were acquitted in los angeles last year of 
several misdemeanor charges stemming from a protest there terry 
and two other defendants face retrial on conspiracy charges on 
which jurors deadlocked 
legal challenges to operation rescue tactics of staging clinic 
demonstrations around the country have left the organization so far 
in debt that it announced jan 31 it would close its national 
headquarters in binghamton

lawmakers fighting a perception they can be 
bought through campaign gifts clashed tuesday over how to clean up 
election financing without yielding an advantage to their opponents 
testifying before the senate rules committee on campaign finance 
reform legislation it will begin writing next week republicans 
continued to oppose spending ceilings wanted by democrats to dilute 
the gops superiority in raising funds through direct mail 
solicitations 
democrats lashed out at president bushs proposals to outlaw 
corporation labor union and trade association political action 
committees or pacs and prevent lawmakers from using their campaign 
kitties to help defray office expenses 
you are meddling a little bit in the way we run our offices 
the panels chairman sen wendell ford dky told assistant 
attorney general william barr the administrations chief witness 
ford complained bushs proposal would allow lawmakers to augment 
their office expenses with money from senate party campaign 
committee accounts where republicans enjoyed a 51 fundraising 
advantage in the 1988 election 
and now you want to use that money to beat us over the head 
he said 
as an alternative to taxpayer financing of elections long sought 
by democrats and opposed by republicans sen alan cranston 
dcalif suggested a public financing scheme using voluntary 
1amonth contributions through the payroll tax withholding system 
so long as our elected representatives must depend on private 
contributions to be viable candidates our political system will be 
suspect cranston said 
cranston is one of the keating five senators now under 
investigation by the senate ethics committee for intervening with 
federal thrift regulators in 1987 on behalf of the now collapsed 
lincoln savings and loan association of irvine calif and its 
owner charles h keating jr 
a phoenix millionaire keating had raised more than 13 million 
for the political campaigns and causes of the senators including 
nearly 1 million funneled to groups associated with cranston 
meanwhile freshmen sens mitch mcconnell rky and harry 
reid dnev found little support for their bipartisan compromise 
that avoids the spending ceiling issue curbs but does not outlaw 
pacs and gives the federal election commission more enforcement 
powers 
this all or nothing attitude on both sides solves absolutely 
nothing reid said if we cant agree on pacs and spending 
limits lets us at least reach a bipartisan accord on these other 
issues 
other democrats however said they are unwilling to curb the 
growing influence of pacs without restrictions on overall spending 
only in a coordinated package of general restraint on campaign 
expenditures do i think that it makes sense to have limits on 
pacs house speaker thomas s foley told reporters without 
campaign spending limits there can be no reform worthy of the 
name 
foley said he would meet later this week with house republican 
leader robert h michel of illinois who in december said for the 
first time that he was willing to consider a spending cap 
since then however michel has been silent on the issue while 
the administration and other republican leaders have maintained 
their opposition to any ceiling 
with or without an agreement foley said he will bring a bill to 
the house floor in april 
ford said the senate rules committee would begin writing a bill 
next week using as a foundation a bill by senate democratic leader 
george mitchell of maine and sens david boren dokla and robert 
c byrd dwva 
that bill would provide voluntary general election spending 
ceilings ranging from 950000 to 55 million depending on a 
states population 
various carrots and sticks to achieve compliance are still being 
negotiated behind the scenes the most likely is a combination of 
discount mail and television advertising rates for candidates who 
spend under the limit

the senate on tuesday refused to cut off 
debate on a resolution designating an armenian genocide leaving 
the future of the measure up in the air 
it was the second time in two weeks that senate minority leader 
bob dole rkan has tried and failed to end a filibuster 
against the resolution the vote was 5148 against dole who needed 
60 votes to invoke cloture 
dole has pledged to keep fighting for the measure saying he 
might ask for another vote to end the filibuster or introduce the 
resolution in a different form 
the measure which designates april 24 as national day of 
remembrance of the 75th anniversary of the armenian genocide of 
19151923 has created a firestorm in turkey which strenously 
objects to the use of the word genocide 
dole who became familiar with armenian issues when a doctor of 
armenian descent treated him for injuries he received in world war 
ii fought strenously for the measure 
he said americans of armenian heritage deserved to be recognized 
for their suffering and called the resolution a human rights 
issue on tuesday dole met with a group of elderly people from new 
jersey and pennsylvania who lived through the events of the ottoman 
empire in the early 20th century 
the alleged genocide occurred before the birth of the current 
republic of turkey the armenians claim 15 million were killed 
because of their race 
but turkish officials say there was no genocide they say some 
600000 people including muslims and christians were killed in 
the turbulent times because of civil strife and marauding bands 
sen robert byrd dwva led a filibuster against the dole 
resolution he began talking against the measure last week arguing 
the resolution would poison relations between the united states and 
turkey a nato ally 
the turkish government has threatened retaliatory action against 
the united states if the resolution passes if the resolution 
passes the senate it would go to the house and eventually to 
president bush if both chambers approved it 
the bush administration opposed the dole resolution but dole 
said tuesday that white house officials would not object to 
softening the language and making it a socalled concurrent 
resolution bush would not have to sign such a measure

the national transportation safety board 
rejected an appeal tuesday from a los angeles lawyer to reopen its 
investigation into the kentucky church bus crash that killed 24 
children and three adults 
the fourmember board voted unanimously to reject a petition on 
behalf of lawrence and janey fair who lost their 14yearold 
daughter shannon in the may 14 1988 crash board members said 
lawyer john p coale failed to raise any new evidence related to 
the crash 
the board completing its investigation last march said the 
crash clearly was caused by a drunken pickup truck driver but also 
cited characteristics of the 11yearold former school bus as 
contributing to its severity 
the pickup driver larry mahoney was sentenced friday to 16 
years in prison after being convicted of 27 counts each of 
seconddegree manslaughter and firstdegree wonton endangerment and 
one count of drunken driving 
mahoneys truck going the wrong way on interstate 71 near 
carrollton ky slammed headon into the bus which was quickly 
engulfed in flames 
the board in rejecting coales petition noted that it had 
already recommended improved standards for protecting school bus 
fuel systems 
coale contended that the bus involved in the accident contained 
significant construction and design defects that may have 
contributed to the puncturing of its fuel tank and the entry of 
smoke and fire into the passenger area 
the board in its investigation recommended that older school 
buses used by churches and other groups be retired since they do 
not meet stricter safety standards that have applied to school 
buses since 1977

president bush will try to prod japanese prime 
minister toshiki kaifu this week to a more conciliatory posture in 
sofar sluggish talks over contentious trade issues an 
administration official said tuesday 
with kaifus recent election to the post he held on an interim 
basis the bush administration hopes he will see fit to bend his 
governments trade positions more to the us view said the 
official who briefed reporters on bushs upcoming meeting with 
kaifu 
kaifu is flying to california at bushs invitation for talks 
friday and saturday in palm springs 
the official said the meeting was conceived to address a 
wideranging set of bilateral issues and the future global 
partnership of japan and the united states 
he said that the two heads of state will not conduct 
negotiations as such but that part of the emphasis will be on 
achieving progress in the structural impediments initiative talks 
which are aimed at addressing the underlying causes of japans 
persistently huge trade imbalance with the united states 
the talks on reducing the 49 billion trade imbalance between 
the two countries ended friday with few signs of progress and ample 
evidence of mutual frustration 
us officials conceded frustration and concern while the 
japanese said the administration had demands more severe than tokyo 
had anticipated 
the administration contends that because of japans focus on its 
recent election campaign which returned the ruling liberal 
democratic party to power the political prodding needed to move 
the sii talks beyond such roadblocks was missing 
the sii exchanges have been at the technical level the 
official said tuesday 
the sii talks are to produce an interim report by april and a 
final report in july 
the administration looked for bolder reform proposals from japan 
after the most recent sii round was postponed for more than a month 
for japans national parliamentary election 
bush also will discuss with kaifu the prospect of japanese aid 
to help the beleaguered nicaraguan economy now that its elections 
have concluded with the usbacked violeta chamorro as the new 
president said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater

european space authorities named a sevenmember 
panel tuesday to investigate last weeks explosion of an ariane 
rocket carrying two japanese telecommunications satellites 
preliminary results of the inquiry will be submitted to the 
european space agency esa and arianespace on march 20 the two 
organizations said in a joint press statement 
jacques durand the french director of the ariane 5 program 
will preside over the committee composed of west german belgian 
italian and french aerospace experts 
the panel is also charged with recommending ways to prevent 
future accidents its findings will not be made public before the 
reports are handed to the esa and arianespace the statement said 
frederic dallest president of arianespace has said the 
findings of the panel should help reassure customers of arianes 
reliability despite thursdays failure 
the 44l rocket experienced a loss in power in a booster just 
after lifting off from the ariane launch pad in kourou french 
guiana technicians were unable to control the rocket and were 
eventually forced to abandon the mission 
the vehicle blew apart over the atlantic ocean 1 minute 41 
seconds into flight the first failure in an ariane flight since 
1986 and the fifth in 36 missions 
the two japanese satellites were valued by one of the companies 
the mitsubishi subsidiary space communications corp at more than 
600 million 
flights of the unmanned ariane rockets had become almost 
routine with the european consortium capturing more than 50 
percent of the worlds lucrative satellite launch business 
analysts have said arianespace the commercial operation that 
runs the program for the esa must solve the problem quickly to 
avoid a loss in customer confidence

seven years ago ramiro gurdian says 
he was threatened with death for criticizing the sandinista 
government 
his ranch candelaria the biggest banana plantation in 
nicaragua was summarily confiscated 
now that the sandinistas and president daniel ortega have been 
thrashed at the polls losing by a widespread margin in sundays 
general elections to opposition leader violeta barrios de chamorro 
gurdian wants candelaria back 
but for now hes hoping for a peaceful transition of power to 
the united national opposition alliance headed by mrs chamorro 
our position is we have to have a society where all 
nicaraguans have space to live said gurdian we have to 
respect the loser and his rights 
as president of the nicaraguan union of agriculture and cattle 
producers and vice president of the superior council of private 
enterprise the two most important private business groups in 
nicaragua gurdian was among those who drafted unos economic 
program 
it calls for reprivatizing scores of companies that were 
confiscated by the sandinistas and have become bloated with state 
workers and inefficient through government intervention 
it also calls for returning confiscated lands without harming 
the thousands of peasant families that benefited from the 
sandinista agrarian reform which may be a tricky process 
businessmen say they know that political stability is essential 
for renewed economic activity 
the sandinistas who will form a strong and cohesive minority in 
the national assembly may fight many of the new governments 
moves and government workers already fear losing their jobs 
if uno decides to privatize the banking system it could be an 
irresponsible act that starts a war said rafael solis a 
sandinista military commander 
negotiations between sandinistas and leaders of the 14party uno 
coalition have not started said a highly placed uno source 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
we cant push them the sandinistas right now because this is 
a very dangerous time and theyre very tense said the source 
we have to leave them alone and let them seek a path out on their 
own 
uno already has made some policy decisions 
there will be no sandinistas in the uno cabinet alfredo cesar 
a top aide to presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro told the 
associated press 
party cadres will find themselves out of work but lowerranking 
technocrats are needed for continuity cesar said 
uno is putting together a transition team that would include 
cesar and hold conversations with the sandinistas 
thousands of businessmen technicians and professionals fled 
nicaragua during the 10 years of sandinista rule the exodus of 
expertise contributed to a dramatic drop in production levels 
inflation also soared 
but some nicaraguans plan to return gurdian said 
agriculture is the backbone of nicaraguas economy and the 
sowing season starts in april 
many coffee growers simply did not have the money to replace 
broken machinery or the incentives to expand production said 
edgar arguello who owns coffee plantations in central matagalpa 
province 
but now we will have more freedom to do to plant to expand 
youll see how production shoots up in just this first year 
arguello said 
the goal is that year by year we raise production depending 
on resources gurdian said in three to four years we can have 
production levels like those of 1978 the year before the 
sandinistas took power 
negotiations for loans are already in the works so are talks 
with us agrocompanies to invest in nicaragua gurdian said 
construction also is expected to increase the need for housing 
and for repairs to crumbling roads communications and other 
infrastructure is pressing 
with state controls over the marketplace loosened and with an 
expected lifting of the 1985 us economic embargo nicaragua is 
poised to become a land of opportunity gurdian said 
the people are ready gurdian said all were saying is 
well when do we start

the white house on tuesday dismissed a 
published report that us officials had secretly discussed with 
iranian representatives the release of americans held hostage in 
lebanon 
highlevel us officials direct secret talks no said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater when asked by 
reporters about the report in the londonbased arab newspaper 
alhayat do i expect a breakthrough or anything new happening 
no 
the newspaper said that progress was being made in discussions 
among the united states iran and syria aimed at gaining the 
release of foreign hostages in lebanon 
the newspaper quoted unidentified political militia and 
religious sources in beirut as saying that iranian president 
hashemi rafsanjani had convinced the groups holding the 18 foreign 
hostages that they should be released now 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said we are not aware of the source of these stories or any 
talks that fit this description 
he also said that he would not rule out meetings anywhere any 
place any time by anybody on the hostage question because there 
are meetings happening 
by that fitzwater said he meant that the administration 
continues to follow leads and make contacts in its effort to secure 
the release of the eight american hostages he would not be 
specific 
fitzwater also said that despite recent speculation on a number 
of fronts the administration knows of no new evidence to 
support hopes that the hostages release might be forthcoming 
there are no direct talks between the united states and iran 
authorized by the president he said 
i dont know whos talking to who but i guarantee you im 
never going to say that nobodys talking because i know a lot of 
people are 
there are a lot of people around the world talking about 
release of the hostages in lebanon people from other countries 
people from other embassies people on all levels people we dont 
even find out about until after the fact fitzwater said 
alhayat quoted algerian sources as saying that contacts were in 
place through nondiplomatic organizations and that algeria was 
itself involved 
diplomatic sources in damascus syria this week confirmed that 
the united states had a number of channels for reaching iranian 
leaders 
contacts through geneva were one such conduit but the united 
states most recently has used syria and japan to pass messages to 
iran said the sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the sources said there was not one specific set of negotiations 
under way between the united states and iran 
alhayat quoted the leading shiite moslem cleric in lebanon 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah as saying that he supported 
ending the hostage crisis and i bring it up in every possible 
occasion because i do not believe in it from the begining 
an editor at the newspaper said fadlallah spiritual leader of 
the iranianfinanced hezbollah or party of god confirmed that the 
united states and iran were in contact through third parties 
some western hostages are believed held by factions linked to 
hezbollah 
the lebanese hostages include eight americans four britons an 
italian an irishman two west germans and two swiss 
the longestheld is 42yearold terry anderson chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press when kidnapped in march 
1985 
in london andersons sister peggy say said of the latest 
reports i think there have been many many positive signals 
being sent and this is one of them 
the other americans are thomas sutherland frank herbert reed 
joseph james cicippio edward austin tracy jesse turner alann 
steen and robert polhill 
alhayat said the discussions included the fate of four iranians 
who disappeared in lebanon in 1982 as well as the fate of hundreds 
of lebanese and palestinian prisoners held in israel 
the release of the hostages was believed hinged to a power 
struggle in tehran between the pragmatists and radicals in the 
government 
the pragmatists seeking foreign investment to rebuild irans 
economy after eight years of war with iraq are viewed as trying to 
end the hostage issue to burnish irans image 
two tehran newspapers said in editorials this week that the 
hostages in lebanon should go free and chief justice ayatollah 
mohammed yazdi said that iran opposed taking hostages

an appellate court considering a lawsuit 
against a doctor who refused to treat an aids patient heard 
arguments tuesday centering on whether a private physicians office 
is a public accommodation subject to antidiscrimination laws 
the state division of human rights has accused orthopedic 
surgeon daniel elstein of syracuse of violating state 
antidiscrimination laws by refusing to treat ronald derby four 
years ago 
derby who had been elsteins patient since 1982 died of 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome last summer at age 36 he had 
claimed that elstein refused to treat a back ailment in 1986 after 
derby revealed he had aids 
the doctor claims he did not treat derby because he was not 
specially trained to treat aids and instead referred him to an 
aids clinic 
a similar case against a dentist was argued before an appeals 
court in new york city two weeks ago 
the central issue in the elstein lawsuit is whether a doctors 
office is a place of public accommodation as defined in new 
york states antidiscrimination laws 
the division of human rights backed by a coalition of state 
civil rights and aids rights groups argued that a doctors office 
meets the definition the law was intended to prohibit 
discrimination by doctors and other medical professionals in 
providing medical services said albert j kostelny an attorney 
for the human rights agency 
elstein did not restrict his practice in any way except to 
exclude those afflicted with aids kostelny said 
elstein whose case is supported by the state medical and dental 
societies argued that a doctors office is private and not subject 
to the agencys rulings a state judge agreed with elstein in 1988 
ruling that a physicians office is distinctly private 
the division of human rights appealed to the courts appellate 
division the agency argued that allowing private physicians to 
refuse treatment to aids patients would force them to seek care at 
public hospitals and clinics and force a collapse of the entire 
public health system in new york state under the sheer weight of 
the numbers of actual and suspected aids patients 
in new york which has a high concentration of the nations aids 
cases it is especially urgent that physicians not be allowed to 
discriminate on the basis of whether a patient has the disease 
kostelny argued in his brief 
but elsteins attorney catherine a gale said the case is not 
about whether doctors should treat aids patients 
elstein referred derby to the aids clinic rather than treating 
him based on medical considerations not because he didnt want 
to treat an aids patient she said 
deciding whether to treat a patient or to refer him to a 
specialist is clearly a matter of professional judgment gales 
brief said a lay body such as the state human rights division 
is not competent to address issues involving the practice of 
medicine 
in a friendofthecourt brief the state medical society said 
that while no patient should be refused treatment simply because of 
aids an agency of nonmedical professionals should not intrude on 
physicians autonomy 
gale said a more appropriate forum for such cases would be the 
state health departments office of professional medical conduct 
whose board includes medical professionals 
a complaint about elsteins refusal to treat derby was lodged 
with the medical conduct board but an investigation found 
insufficient evidence to take action or hold a formal hearing a 
spokeswoman for the office said 
the appeals court is not expected to issue a decision for at 
least six weeks gale said

nelson mandela embraced exiled african 
national congress leaders and seven african presidents tuesday and 
thanked zambia from the bottom of my heart for providing the 
anc a headquarters in exile 
tens of thousands of zambians thronged the streets to welcome 
the 71yearold south african black leader who was released feb 
11 after 27 years in prison 
at a state banquet given by president kenneth kaunda for 380 
guests mandela praised black african leaders for supporting the 
anc and singled out kaunda as one of the greatest heroes not 
only of africa but of humankind 
south africa legalized the african national congress the main 
organization fighting white supremacy and dozens of other 
antiapartheid groups early in february before mandela was 
released 
mandela said kaunda gave unreserved support to the struggle of 
south africas black majority for freedom and political rights 
from the bottom of my heart i say thank you for all you have 
done and are doing for us he told the president i doubt if i 
will ever forget my first day in zambia 
zambia has provided an exile headquarters to the african 
national congress which mandela led before his imprisonment for 
nearly two decades 
mandela was met at the airport by kaunda and other african 
leaders and world figures including yasser arafat chairman of the 
palestine liberation organization and canadas external affairs 
minister joe clark 
mandela and arafat embraced and mandela later compared the anc 
to the plo saying both were fighting a special brand of 
colonialism 
after his arrival children of anc exiles put garlands of red 
and white flowers on mandela to the beat of drums as dozens of 
guerrillas in green military fatigues looked on 
kaunda 64 current chairman of the sixmember group of 
frontline african nations bordering south africa saw mandela 
last at a meeting of black nationalists in addis ababa ethiopia 
in 1962 
at the airport mandela said those who led the anc in exile 
have directed our people to the point where we are on the 
verge of a breakthrough in our struggle for freedom 
he asked that the international community provide us with 
capital and other resources to reorganize the anc inside south 
africa 
kaunda was a peacemaker who tried to persuade successive south 
african governments to talk with the anc mandela said and if we 
are compelled to resort to arms the responsibility for this 
lies firmly on the shoulders of the government 
the zambian president described mandela as a freedom fighter and 
a truly great son of africa the crowd chanted one africa 
one revolution 
tens of thousands of people urged to turn out by fullpage ads 
in governmentcontrolled newspapers lined the 15mile route from 
lusaka airport to kuandas official residence 
many groups including school children and church choirs waited 
in sweltering tropical sunshine for several hours they waved green 
branches a traditional african symbol of rejoicing in the biggest 
public turnout in zambia since the visit of pope john paul ii in 
may 1989 
kaunda made tuesday a national holiday named nelson mandela day 
and factories offices and shops were closed in lusaka a city of 1 
million 
with mandela is a delegation of 20 african national congress 
members from inside south africa 
meetings scheduled during his sixday stay include a summit of 
the frontline states angola botswana mozambique tanzania 
zambia and zimbabwe and talks with several government leaders 
from the 49nation commonwealth of former british colonies

the pentagon on tuesday assailed a decision by 
house democrats to force the military to accept more than 850 
million in budget cuts that could mean the dismissal of tens of 
thousands of men and women by october 
it would be devastating to our forces its a really terrible 
idea complained pentagon spokesman pete williams 
the subject of the dispute is the pentagons request to congress 
to avoid massive layoffs by shifting 852 million to personnel from 
other accounts mostly for procurement of aircraft vehicles and 
weapons the cuts are required under the grammrudman budget 
cutting law 
house armed services committee chairman les aspin dwis wrote 
pentagon officials that he has reluctantly decided not to bring 
their request before his committee his decision which has the 
backing of house speaker thomas s foley dwash dooms the 
request since his committee is one of four that must approve it 
president bush had the option of exempting military personnel 
from the grammrudman law but he didnt aspin argued in a memo to 
committee members that while bushs decision is painful for the 
military the administration must realize that accepting the 
grammrudman cuts meant accepting their results 
conceding that his decision will cause real pain aspin 
wrote his colleagues if we dont stand firm now this 
administration will have us playing chicken with the budget every 
year distorting the deficit reduction process and relying on us to 
save it from its more irresponsible excesses 
if congress does not allow the pentagon to switch the money 
williams said rough estimates show that 44100 to 68200 military 
personnel would have to be fired by oct 1 between 32500 and 
32600 people would be frozen in their current jobs 57000 to 
67000 promotions would be delayed and 59900 to 115900 fewer men 
and women could be brought into the armed forces 
currently there are about 21 million men and women in uniform 
some members of congress argue the bush administration brought 
the problem on itself in last years budget agreement the 
administration got congress to agree to four months worth of 
automatic spending cuts under the grammrudman budget law 
however williams argued defense secretary dick cheney was 
directed by congress in the defense spending bill to request 
approval of the transfer 
williams quoted the bill as saying the request should be made 
to prevent a return to the 1970s phenomenon of the hollow army 
in which many units were substantially undermanned 
williams said the pentagon has been preparing dramatic 
decreases in force size but to be executed judiciously over a 
period of years 
you dont simply reach in and yank out a certain number of 
people in the force you have to look at the question of 
recruiting people that graduate from military academies 
promotions people who rotate from one position to another and the 
total size of the force and you have to do that very carefully and 
deliberately williams said 
this would have an absolutely devastating effect on our men 
and women in uniform if congress denies us the ability to 
reprogram money in the 90 budget in order to soften the blow of 
the spending cuts on our military personnel williams said 
aspin issued a statement saying the administration last year 
let personnel take cuts and that made the cuts on favored weapon 
systems smaller putting weapons before people was their decision 
and now theyre stuck with it 
christopher jehn assistant secretary of defense for force 
management and personnel told the house armed services 
subcommittee on military personnel and compensation that failure of 
congress to agree to shift funds would be a disaster 
we get the hollowness and fall in readiness that the congress 
itself urged us very strongly to avoid jehn said 
this makes a pretty good case for the administration to work 
more closely with congress responded rep marilyn lloyd dtenn 
i suppose so jehn said 
rep arthur ravenel rsc suggested that perhaps the pentagon 
did not request the exemption back in august knowing that cuts in 
military personnel would be an emotional issue 
there is some validity in the premise that some people have 
that you all sidestepped the request for exemption at that time 
safe in knowledge youd be in pretty good shape politically this 
year with the reprogramming request ravenel said

office of thrift supervision resigned tuesday leaving three of the 
agencys top eight spots vacant as the bush administration searches 
for a new director 
karl t hoyle the senior deputy director in charge of 
congressional and media relations said he was leaving the thrift 
office to start his own lobbying business 
last friday jordan luke chief counsel of the agency said he 
was entering private law practice 
the agencys chief economist james r barth resigned last fall 
to teach at auburn university 
the departures leave only four senior officials at the agency in 
addition to its director m danny wall who resigned dec 4 as the 
top federal sampl regulator wall continues to serve in his post and 
has set no date for his departure 
they are jonathan fiechter policy director darrel dochow 
supervision director rosemary stewart enforcement director and 
gregory rothwell director of administration 
pending the appointment of walls successor the vacant posts 
are being filled on an acting basis by lowerlevel officials 
the treasury department has so far been unable to find a 
replacement for wall who resigned under congressional criticism 
for his handling of the failure of lincoln savings and loan

the leading candidate for the job frederick d wolf the former 
no 2 official at the general accounting office withdrew his name 
last week complaining of treasury officials slowness in acting 
wall had said he was resigning to spare the agency from turmoil 
which would hamper its work however the long delay of his 
departure is creating the problem he sought to avoid according to 
an agency official 
things are slowing down said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity precisely what wall sought to avoid 
disarray at the agency comes as two members of the house banking

parliament on tuesday adopted a 
law that establishes ground rules for the countrys first free 
elections after more than four decades of communist rule 
the law calls for elections based on proportional representation 
in 12 districts identical with the administrative division of 
czechoslovakia 
a party will have to gather 10000 signatures or prove it has 
that many members to be able to run a party must get 5 percent of 
the vote nationally to gain seats 
the elections are set for june and will be the first free 
multiparty balloting since the communists took power in 1948 they 
lost that monopoly late last year in a peaceful revolution 
despite objections by legislators fearful that smaller parties 
would be discriminated against by the 5 percent hurdle the draft 
law was adopted on a vote of 2866 with seven abstentions 
earlier premier marian calfa told the legislature that his 
countrys economy lagged five to 15 years behind advanced nations 
in the west because of decades of monopolistic communist rule that 
had stifled creativity 
in a key report on the state of the country delivered to 
parliament calfa called for energetic measures to stimulate the 
economy by introducing market policies curbing inflation and 
privatizing stateowned property 
we must stop the negative trends and take the first steps 
toward a better future said calfa who renounced his communist 
party membership this year after being named to head the government 
the first since 1948 not dominated by communists 
the gnp growth is estimated at 17 percent in 1989 but 
considering the hidden price increases it is difficult to say 
whether there is any growth at all calfa said 
under the communist leadership it had become common practice to 
repackage a product while increasing its price in an attempt to 
hide the higher costs 
with inflation running at 25 percent to 35 percent and a 
foreign debt of 79 billion at the end of 1989 the czechoslovak 
economy is in far better shape than those of some of its neighbors 
such as poland and hungary 
nevertheless calfa called for strict measures to turn the 
economy around 
an inevitable condition of the entire reform process must 
be a highly restrictive fiscal and financial policy with 
antiinfaltionary effects he said 
to achieve this goal the czechoslovak government plans to cut 
subsidies improve its tax system introduce market policies into 
the pricing process and open the economy to the outside world 
new laws allowing private enterprise and the ownership of land 
will be introduced before the elections however calfa said 
privatization of property should be cautious and gradual 
he also announced planned cuts in military spending of 600 
million in the 1990 budget czechoslovakias military budget 
currently stands at 5 billion representing 8 percent of the 
countrys gnp calfa said 
we know today that integration in the european community in 
the immediate future is improbable but we want to show quite 
clearly that we are attempting that in the long run he said 
we do not want the world to envy us but we have to do 
everything so that our people do not have to envy the world 
calfa concluded

rural communities suffering from lost jobs and 
declining population would have more flexibility to spend federal 
development money if a bill approved tuesday by the house 
agriculture committee becomes law 
money now placed in three funds sewer and water improvements 
business development or community facilities could be shifted 
from one use to another depending on the needs of the community 
each community would name a local committee to decide priorities 
reps glenn english dokla and tom coleman rmo who 
drafted the measure said it solves the problem of differing needs 
in declining rural economies around the country 
english said his subcommittee on rural development interviewed 
250 witnesses in washington and local areas before designing the 
legislation 
each had a different idea on what rural development meant 
said english one thing they all agreed on was that they wanted 
more money 
but because of the pressures the deficit puts on the budget 
there is no more money said english 
he said his bill allows regional committees to decide how to use 
the money that is available instead of relying on washington to 
make the decisions 
some are going to need more water and sewer work said 
english we say fine take the money from some other area and 
shift it to your needs 
the agriculture department would still have authority over the 
funds but priorities would be set locally 
rep charles rose dnc opposed the plan saying it put too 
much strain on the sewer and water fund which is the largest of 
the three with about 400 million this year compared to 100 
million for business development and 100 million for community 
facilities 
rep h martin lancaster dnc said communities might divert 
money to business develpment and let infrastructure suffer 
im afraid water and sewer will get resources only when there 
is an emergency said lancaster 
rose offered an amendment to the bill that would have removed 
water and sewer money from the pool of funds but english fought 
off his effort by proposing an amendment that limited the amount of 
money that could be shifted 
coleman said the bill is compatible with a report recently 
released by president bushs economic policy council working group 
on rural development 
he said those findings showed 
rural america needs help 
federal rural development programs must look beyond traditional 
farm programs 
rural development is essentially an economic issue 
economic stress hurting most rural communities is primarily 
nonagricultural 
rapid change in rural american demands tighter coordination of 
federal rural development programs 
local community leadership is at the heart of any successful 
rural development program 
english and colemans bill creates a rural development 
administration within the agriculture department to direct federal 
policies 
it also sets up an information center to be a clearinghouse for 
ideas that have proven successful in some rural communities 
this will help small town america become more competitive in 
todays global economy said coleman 
last summer the senate passed a rural development bill 
sponsored by sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate 
agriculture committee that differs greatly from the house measure 
it has three basic provisions 
a 300 million revolving fund that would provide seed money for 
businesses 
satellite educational and health communication systems 
improved drinking water

nearly a quartermillion soviet jews are 
expected to immigrate to israel in 1990 three times the previous 
estimate a senior government official was quoted as saying tuesday 
on israel television 
the sudden leap in the estimate the source said derives from 
the opening of new migration channels that would allow 230000 jews 
to come to israel the television reported 
the television did not reveal the identity of the senior 
official but noted that its estimates on soviet immigration had 
previously been accurate 
so far this year 9441 soviet jews have arrived and earlier 
israeli estimates put the number of expected soviet immigrants in 
1990 at 80000 due to more liberated soviet emigration policies 
american visa restrictions and allegations of rising antisemitism 
in the soviet union 
last year about 12000 soviet jews settled in israel 
at present most soviet jews leave for hungary and romania and 
are then flown on to israel after the emigrants reach budapest or 
bucharest by airplane or train the report comes immediately 
following the resumption of ties tuesday between israel and poland 
on monday finance minister shimon peres said that israelis may 
have to lower their standards of living to absorb the growing 
number of soviet jewish immigrants 
the finance ministry has set aside 503 million to absorb 40000 
soviet jews in the fiscal year starting in april 
an equal amount has been earmarked by the quasigovernmental 
jewish agency for immigrant absorption 
israel television reported tuesday that immigration officials 
have called for the scraping of the present budget saying that 10 
billion is now needed for absorption in light of the new estimates

a royal marine commando who admitted 
killing his wife and baby boy was released tuesday by a judge who 
told him you have punished yourself enough 
graham sherman 21 had been found guilty of homicide for the 
shotgun slaying of his wife michelle 23 and monthold son josh as 
they slept in their home last november 
the motive for the killings has not been explained 
it is a strange message to come from a courtroom that the 
crime of homicide can be purged by mental selfpunishment is this 
to be universally applied in scottish courts brian wilson 
scottish spokesman for the opposition labor party said in london 
this is a terrible decision said david evans a lawmaker 
from the governing conservative party 
the judge lord dunpark told sherman the sentence was something 
i dont anticipate i will ever do again i am going to 
admonish you on both charges 
the judge said the purpose of sentencing is to punish and to 
deter others 
in my opinion you have punished yourself more than enough by 
what you did the judge said 
you will have to live with this for the rest of your life you 
dont know why you did it no one has been able to offer an 
explanation as to why you did it 
there was no deterrent value in a prison sentence the judge 
said for no one in their right mind would have killed without 
reason these two people who were dearest to them in the world 
but thats what you did theres no point in deferring 
sentence for good behavior you have no previous convictions 
neither is this a case in which in my opinion a probation order 
would help you it would just keep reminding you of what you have 
done 
and the sooner you try to forget this the better for all 
these reasons i admonish you on both these charges and you have my 
deep sympathy 
a letter that sherman wrote to his sisterinlaw but never 
mailed was read in court 
i dont expect forgiveness nor do i expect anyone to 
understand why i have gone over it time and time again in my mind 
and i still cant find an answer the letter said 
if i could turn back time and get rid of this tragedy then i 
would 
you all know that i love michelle and josh with all my heart 
and believe me i still do i cant explain the way i feel now 
its all like a terrible nightmare one which i know i will 
never wake up from the letter said

sandinista demand that they disband immediately and said they will 
not leave their honduran bases until the sandinistas turn over 
power to the newly elected nicaraguan government 
we dont trust the sandinistas said israel galeano the top 
leader of the usbacked contras they are capable of 
relinquishing the government but not power or weapons to the 
winners of last sundays election 
presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro of the 14party 
united national opposition handed president daniel ortega a 
stunning defeat latest returns showed her winning 55 percent to 40 
percent 
ortega said tuesday the contras must disband for there to be a 
peaceful transition of power 
we will not return to nicaragua until the sandinistas leave 
power in our country galeano said 
mrs chamorro is to be sworn in as president for a sixyear term 
on april 25 
earlier tuesday president rafael leonardo callejas said the 
thousands of contras based near the nicaraguan border must leave 
honduras as soon as possible 
i dont want to force circumstances in nicaragua which is now 
going through a period of political transition following a victory 
by the opposition at the polls but these rebels should not 
continue to stay in our territory he told a news conference 
callejas indicated there was no point in the contras continuing 
as a fighting force against nicaraguas leftist sandinistas 
now with the electoral defeat of the sandinistas there are 
better democratic guarantees in nicaragua for the quick 
repatriation of those who have taken up arms callejas said 
honduran officials estimated there are about 10000 contra 
rebels and some 42000 dependents living in makeshift base camps in 
southern honduras near the nicaraguan border 
most of them had pulled back from nicaragua after the united 
state cut off military aid in 1988 and limited assistance only to 
nonlethal items most of them have been staying in the area around 
yamales 120 miles southeast of tegucigalpa 
but galeano said he and his people were in no great hurry to 
return to nicaragua preferring to wait until mrs chamorro is 
sworn in as president 
we will return to nicaragua when the sandinistas abandon 
power i believe this will be very soon once mrs chamorro 
consolidates herself in the presidency of my country galeano 
said in an interview 
we are a cancer that no one wants that is why we should act 
with caution before those events taking place in nicaragua said 
galeano who also calls himself commander franklin 
many ordinary nicaraguan refugees who have not been involved 
with the contras were planning to return home as soon as possible 
before mrs chamorro takes office a spokesman said 
we all want to return saod ramon rivera a refugee leader 
in los guacimos a refugee camp about 80 miles northeast of 
tegucigalpa many of us refugees are packing our bags to return 
to nicaragua before chamorro takes over the great majority of us 
will do so afterwards 
we are very glad mrs chamorro won we never expected it 
said rivera 56 a peasant farmer who sought refuge with his wife 
and three children in honduras in 1982 
he is coordinator of the camp one of more than a dozen holding 
an estimated 40000 nicaraguan refugees nationwide the refugees

sen juan ponce enrile who played a 
key role in bringing corazon aquino to power was arrested tuesday 
on charges of aiding coup plotters and the opposition accused her 
of trying to eradicate dissent 
military dissidents said the arrest of enrile was a prelude to 
martial law he helped put mrs aquino in power four years ago but 
now is the only opposition member of the senate 
enrile was among seven people indicted tuesday for rebellion 
with murder in connection with the coup attempt dec 19 in which 
at least 113 people were killed and more than 600 wounded 
enriles law partner renato cayetano said he would ask the 
supreme court on wednesday to release the senator for his own 
safety and because the charges were false 
enrile is the most prominent figure charged in any of the six 
coup attempts since mrs aquino was swept to power in february 1986 
by the people power uprising that drove the late president 
ferdinand e marcos into exile 
he was defense minister under marcos but turned against him and 
led the military mutiny that prompted the uprising enrile kept the 
post under mrs aquino but she fired him in november 1986 after a 
coup attempt by his followers 
on tuesday presidential press secretary tomas gomez said 
what we are witnessing today is the effective operation of our 
criminal justice system under a constitutional democracy he said 
the 160000 members of the military were put on alert to prevent 
reprisals for the action against enrile 
vice president salvador laurel described the arrest as an 
attempt to stifle the political opposition laurel broke with mrs 
aquino in 1987 and later joined enrile in forming the opposition 
nacionalista party 
the arrest of sen juan ponce enrile is the height of 
intolerance of political dissent which is the essence of a 
functioning democracy laurel said in a statement the attempt 
to simulate compliance with legal processes merely heightens the 
hypocrisy of the act 
later tuesday a spokesman for soldiers involved in the december 
coup said the nation should brace itself for the imminent 
declaration of martial law 
in a radio interview wednesday gomez said that despite his 
position enrile led the numerous attempts at a coup detat to 
destroy this government of ours 
when there are no arrests people say the government is 
weak gomez said now that the criminals have been arrested 
then we are called vindictive how can we have compassion for 
an individual who has repeatedly time and time again molested the 
peace and stability of our country 
agents of the national bureau of investigation took enrile into 
custody outside the senate chamber after serving him with an arrest 
warrant that included the charge of harboring fugitives 
enrile one of the nations wealthiest businessmen told 
reporters he would ask the supreme court for bail which is not 
usually allowed for the charges he faces 
indicted with enrile 66 were former lt col gregorio 
gringo honasan rodolfo aguinaldo former governor of cagayan 
province retired brig gen felix brawner retired lt col billy 
bibit and businessman rebecco panlilio and his wife 
three people claimed they saw honasan and about 100 rebels at 
enriles home on the first day of the attempted coup the senator 
claims not to have seen honasan his former protege since 1987 
in a senate speech before his arrest enrile said the regime 
of president corazon c aquino has marshaled all its forces in 
fabricating charges against me in order to silence the voice of the 
opposition in this chamber 
as marcos defense minister enrile ordered thousands of people 
arrested during martial law in 197281 including her husband 
benigno who later was assassinated 
aguinaldo a former army lieutenant colonel was suspended as 
cagayans governor for 60 days after telling a manila radio station 
he was sending tanks to the capital to support the coup 
honasan who has been dropped from military rolls led the 
august 1987 mutiny against mrs aquino and played a leading role in 
decembers attempt he was arrested in december 1987 but escaped 
the next april 
brawner former military commander of northern luzon served as 
a consultant to the senate defense committee after retiring from 
the armed forces in 1989 he is accused of advising the rebels 
bibit security chief of the customs bureau is accused of 
giving the mutineers weapons and food he was arrested last month 
panlilio and his wife were reported seen at enriles house with 
honasan on the first day of the december coup

a federal judge on tuesday refused to 
overturn the conviction of a 24yearold hacker who unleashed a 
worm program that paralyzed thousands of computers nationwide 
in 1988 
us district judge howard munson set sentencing for robert 
morris for may 4 in syracuse 
the suspended cornell university student faces up to five years 
in prison and a 250000 fine for unleashing a computer worm that 
immobilized an estimated 6000 computers across the country 
including ones at the national aeronautics and space 
administration military installations and major universities 
the arnold md man was the first person brought to trial under 
a section of a 1986 federal computer fraud and abuse law that makes 
it a felony to break into and use a federal computer network 
his lawyer thomas guidoboni said prosecutors did not prove 
morris had actually broken the law because he technically had 
access to the cornell university computer system where the virus 
was introduced 
but the judge said morris had entered computer files he was not 
supposed to us justice department lawyer mark rasch said morris 
had described his own conduct to investigators as a breakin 
the federal judge also rejected guidobonis argument that a new 
trial be ordered because a remark by justice department lawyer 
ellen meltzer about terrorism inflamed a community sensitive 
about terrorist acts 
meltzer had told the jurors during closing arguments in the case 
that they shouldnt thank morris for prompting an increase in 
computer security just as they wouldnt thank a terrorist for 
increased airport security 
this remark was particularly insensitive in syracuse because 35 
students in a syracuse university program were killed in december 
1988 when a terrorist bomb exploded on pan am flight 103 over 
lockerbie scotland the lawyer said 
but munson said the objectionable remark was an isolated 
event in an otherwise fair trial 
morris dressed in a gray suit sat quietly as the lawyers 
argued guidoboni said it has not been decided whether he will 
appeal the verdict 
during his trial witnesses testified that the worm did not 
permanently harm the computers or computer files but in some cases 
people were unable to use their computers for several days while 
the virus was hunted down and removed 
morris testified during his trial that he had made a programming 
error that caused the worm to go berserk and cripple the internet 
system on nov 2 1988 he said he did not intend to cause 
permanent damage to computer files only to infiltrate the 
networks security 
prosecutors contended that morris may not have intended harm 
but that he deliberately broke into internet and took deliberate 
steps to make his worm difficult to detect and eradicate

they happen to be that way any man that has a desire to be with 
another man has a problem in my opinion king said and that 
applies to any woman who has a desire to be with another woman 
king did not talk to reporters afterward 
an official with a national gay rights group called kings

the usx corp discriminated against 8000 
black job applicants even under the supreme courts more stringent 
standards for proving bias a federal appeals court has ruled 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals upheld for the second time 
a 1983 us district court ruling that the company discriminated in 
the hiring of production and maintenance employees at its fairless 
pa steel mill 
the federal appeals court first upheld the ruling in 1988 but 
was ordered last year to restudy the case by the supreme court 
this means that once again the court of appeals has determined 
that usx discriminated against a class of black people and those 
people are entitled to a significant monetary remedy said 
attorney richard z freeman jr who represented the job 
applicants he estimated the ruling could cost the steel 
manufacturer nearly 30 million 
attorneys for usx did not return telephone calls seeking comment 
on the friday ruling by the appeals court 
the supreme court last june ordered the appeals court circuit 
court to reexamine its ruling in light of the high courts june 5 
1989 decision in wards cove packing co vs atonio 
the wards cove decision said minorities could not rely solely on 
statistics to prove discrimination but must link the data to a 
specific corporate employment policy 
the decision also allowed companies to justify practices that 
appear to have statistically discriminatory by showing the policy 
was a reasonable employment policy 
in its recent ruling the appeals court determined that even 
under the new more restrictive guidelines the blacks in the 
classaction suit had proved discrimination in hiring practices 
the court found that because the positions at issue were for 
unskilled workers any ablebodied person should be competent to 
perform the job 
since the hiring process was subjective the interviews had a 
significantly disparate impact on blacks as the percentage of 
successful black interviewees was significantly less than the 
overall percentage of successful interviewees chief judge a 
leon higginbotham jr wrote in the appeals court decision

a grand jury has failed to indict a 
sheriff who was arrested on charges of doling out confiscated 
moonshine to friends for medicinal use 
im awful thankful this matter is over madison county 
sheriff dedrick brown said after a country grand jury took no 
action against him monday the judicial process has come through 
again 
brown a firstterm sheriff who is up for reelection to another 
fouryear term this year was arrested feb 9 by state bureau of 
investigation agents on a charge of altering destroying or 
stealing criminal evidence 
six halfgallon jugs of the illegal brew brown seized in a raid 
two weeks before his arrest were given to several of his friends 
investigators said sbi director robert morgan said one of his 
agents was present during one exchange at the sheriffs office 
brown said 25 or 30 people offered to testify on his behalf that 
its a centuryold tradition in the mountain county for sheriffs to 
hand out white lightning but the tradition will have to do 
without brown 
i dont think it would be worth going through this again he 
said 
the sheriff and county residents said moonshine is used in the 
western north carolina area for home remedies such as cough 
medicine 
brown a republican blamed democratic foes for the flap an 
allegation denied by a chief criminal investigator for democratic 
state attorney general lacy thornburg who oversees the sbi 
district attorney tom rusher who is a republican said the sbi 
arrested brown without rushers knowledge rusher said he was 
unable to muster much zeal for prosecuting brown and did not 
expect to seek other charges

no party can govern romania alone and 
a coalition would be best no matter how the may elections come out 
interim president ion iliescu was quoted as saying in an interview 
published tuesday 
iliescu leads the national salvation front which took over 
during the uprising against the 24year reign of communist dictator 
nicolae ceausescu who was overthrown dec 22 and executed dec 25 
the front has been accused of being undemocratic and was forced 
to share power after reneging on its pledge not to enter candidates 
in the may 20 elections 
regardless of the results of the elections the most 
realistic thing is to establish a multiparty coalition to govern 
the country iliescu was quoted as saying in an interview with 
romania libera the countrys largestselling newspaper 
he said the majority of parties and political formations are 
too weak to govern and not even the front is strong enough to 
do it alone 
the coalition proposal met with mixed reaction from major 
political rivals 
radu campeanu president of the national liberal party did not 
rule out a possible alliance with the front 
the situation in the country is and will continue to be so 
grave that such a coalition of different political forces may be 
helpful he said 
campeanu said however that there is not a great deal of 
ideological common ground between the front and his party which 
favors speedier restructuring of the centralized ecomony into a 
free market one 
the fronts main rival the national peasants party was less 
enthusiastic 
it is impossible to pronounce ourselves in favor of or against 
such a coalition before we know what the election results are 
said party spokesman valentin gabrielescu in any case we would 
much prefer a coalition with other parties and are working to 
establish an alliance with them before the elections 
critics say iliescu and other former communists who ran afoul of 
ceausescu want to retain some aspects of totalitarian rule they 
contend among other things that the front controls television in 
a heavyhanded manner 
several important parties are working toward an alliance against 
the front leaders of the peasant liberal social democratic and 
labor parties say they expect an agreement within two weeks 
iliescu was quoted as saying the communist party which 
dissolved after ceausescu fell was too unpopular to regain power 
about general policy he said the government would encourage 
private agriculture and business but keep some large state farms 
and industries he said ways would be sought to introduce more 
decentralization and freemarket principles to state enterprises 
fourteen armored personnel carriers blocking off government 
headquarters in victory square were removed tuesday they were 
brought in feb 19 the day after protesters stormed and ransacked 
the headquarters 
the council of national unity an assembly of the front and 40 
other parties governing romania until the elections passed a 
decree friday imposing stricter penalties on demonstrators who 
threaten government or party buildings 
about 100 students demonstrated outside the interior ministry 
against the governments handling of the officially defunct 
securitate ceausescus hated secret police 
gheorghe constantin an organizer of the rally said the 
students from bucharest university and the polytechnical institute 
wanted to know exactly what has happened to the securitate how 
it was structured and where every one of its former operatives are 
now 
we are convinced the securitate still exists he said 
some of us still have our phones bugged and have received 
threats 
on monday military officers showed reporters how they had begun 
dismantling securitate telephonetapping centers and said their 
work was proof widespread eavesdropping would not recur 
securitate agents tapped tens of thousands of telephones as part 
of a vast domestic spying apparatus

an aspiring screenwriter filed a 35 
million federal lawsuit tuesday against eddie murphy contending 
the actorcomedian stole material from him for the movie harlem 
nights 
at a news conference michael greene estimated that the movie 
has 100 similarities to an original screenplay he wrote for murphy 
in 1988 called a halloween to remember 
paramount pictures corp lawyer les fagen whose company is 
named with murphy as a defendant denied the allegation he said 
any similarities were common motifs found in hundreds of movies 
greene 35 of hempstead on long island said he submitted his 
copyright script to murphy in january 1989 and was soon advised 
murphy was not interested in it 
greene said the script was never returned to him 
i used to consider murphy a hero greene said now i think 
he is an egomaniac hes out for himself 
the lawsuit filed in us district court in uniondale seeks at 
least 35 million in damages for copyright infringement 
both scripts were about 8yearold orphan boys being raised by 
underworld figures both took place in the 1930s and both included 
a corrupt italian plainclothes police officer greene said 
he said both stories revolved around a duffle bag of money and 
both had murphy fighting with elderly characters 
im not going to tell you that he took michaels screenplay 
and put it up on the screen but he clearly edited it cut it and 
pasted it said greenes attorney steven legum 
fagen said the lawsuit was groundless 
weve reviewed michael greenes screenplay and the screenplay 
for the motion picture harlem nights we find no similarity which 
could form the basis for a lawsuit he said 
in january pulitzer prizewinning columnist art buchwald and 
producer alain bernheim won a lawsuit against paramount that 
claimed the studio took the idea for the 1988 movie coming to 
america from a screen treatment by buchwald 
paramount was ordered by a judge to pay the two 19 percent of 
the movies net profits the amount owed has not yet been 
determined

a former owner of a local fruitjuice company was 
sentenced tuesday to two years in prison for selling orange juice 
adulterated with ingredients not listed on container labels 
whitecollar crime is truly a violent crime because it tears 
at the fabric of society us district judge milton shadur told 
edward boden sr in sentencing him to two years in prison a 
250000 fine and 1000 hours of community service 
boden 67 former president and chairman of bodines inc 
pleaded guilty in december to three felony counts of selling 
adulterated food under a plea bargain with federal prosecutors 
bodens son edward boden jr pleaded guilty to five 
misdemeanor counts he was sentenced to two years probation fined 
200000 and ordered to perform 200 hours of community service 
boden and his son were two of three former owners of 
chicagobased bodines who were charged with selling adulterated 
food 
roger walsh jr a texas resident was sentenced last week to 
two years probation and 200 hours of community service walsh had 
pleaded guilty to misdemeanor counts 
all three were originally indicted last july on 19 felony counts 
the guilty pleas were entered to charges that specified only 
five shipments of adulterated juice and named only grapefruit 
solids as adulterants federal prosecutors had accused bodines of 
selling more than 7 million cases of 100 percent pure frozen 
concentrated orange juice which actually contained such 
ingredients as beet sugar corn sugar and distilled water 
proseuctors said the juice was sold under about 50 brand names 
at supermarkets in 36 states from 1978 to 1985 
assistant us attorney thomas durkin said us food and drug 
administration inspectors on three occasions discovered bodines 
was doctoring the juice but the company continued doing it 
prosecutors said that because bodines had been cutting the 
juice with cheaper ingredients the company was able to undercut 
competitors and increase orange juice sales from 5 million to 100 
million during the sevenyear period

joseph hazelwood exercised bad judgment 
in virtually every decision he made the night the exxon valdez ran 
aground a veteran sea captain testified tuesday at hazelwoods 
trial 
robert beevers a consultant who spent 14 years as a tanker 
captain said the worst move hazelwood made on march 24 was leaving 
the ships bridge in the hands of a third mate during a hazardous 
passage into prince william sound 
he created the risk of grounding of losing the vessel of 
fire explosion and death to his crew and of pollution that 
occurred said beevers who testified as a prosecution expert 
soon after hazelwood left the bridge the exxon valdez impaled 
itself on bligh reef causing the nations worst oil spill 
in my opinion it was bad judgment to leave the bridge at 
that location at that time beevers said whether it was one 
minute or 20 minutes it was bad judgment 
in another development tuesday a federal grand jury in 
anchorage indicted exxon corp and its shipping subsidiary on five 
counts in the spill 
if convicted of the two felonies and three misdemeanors in the 
indictment the company could be fined up to 16 million us 
attorney general dick thornburgh told a washington news conference 
the government could also seek as much as 700 million more 
under federal laws allowing recovery of twice the amount of the 
proven loss caused by the spill us attorney mark davis of alaska 
said at the news conference 
hazelwood attorney michael chalos criticized the timing of the 
indictment 
its interesting that it should be happening now just as were 
finishing the hazelwood trial chalos said they waited this 
long why couldnt they wait two weeks longer the trial is 
expected to last about two more weeks 
nearly 11 million gallons of oil were dumped into the pristine 
sound killing countless birds fish and other wildlife and 
blackening hundreds of miles of rocky shore 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is charged with 
seconddegree criminal mischief a felony and three misdemeanors 
reckless endangerment operating a vessel while intoxicated and 
negligent discharge of oil if convicted on all counts he could be 
sentenced to up to 7 years in prison and 61000 in fines 
in the trials fourth week beevers offered the most direct 
criticism yet of hazelwood giving him bad marks on such actions as 
his lastminute arrival before sailing a hasty decision to divert 
the tanker from shipping lanes to avoid ice and transferring 
control to the third mate shortly before the ship rammed the reef 
hazelwoods attorneys objected repeatedly to the testimony 
saying he is not charged with exercising bad judgment and that 
beevers opinions were irrelevant but superior court judge karl 
johnstone allowed the testimony to continue and reprimanded 
hazelwood lawyer dick madson after a pointed exchange with beevers 
madson rose from his chair to crossexamine beevers and 
declared am i standing here before the eyes of god 
mr beevers youre not perfect are you madson asked 
beevers 
no im not beevers responded 
and have you ever had someone hired to say you exercised bad 
judgment said madson 
no said beevers 
beevers who spent four hours on the witness stand and was to 
continue wednesday said he is being paid 35000 for helping in 
the case he retired from the merchant marine in 1987 
beevers was especially critical of hazelwoods decision to leave 
third mate gregory cousins alone on the bridge with a helmsman 
the witness portrayed cousins as a mate far too inexperienced to 
be left with such a task noting that he had only 13 months of sea 
experience on his license 
he was heading into a dangerous situation a situation that 
needed someone with experience to maneuver it a situation that was 
beyond what you would expect a relatively inexperienced third mate 
to do on his own beevers said 
he also criticized hazelwood for leaving at the wheel a helmsman 
who had problems with steering

honey even if you dont have it you flaunt it on mardi gras 
whats that saying less is more thats definitely true said 
jim owen of los angeles dressed in a tight black miniskirt tennis 
ballstuffed bra and high heels 
along the balconies in the french quarter revelers dropped beads 
to celebrants below and women bared their breasts to the delight of 
onlookers 
well technically dropping beads is illegal but showing their 
breasts isnt or at least we dont arrest them for it in fact we 
pretty much just let it all roll by unless someone gets too out of 
control said police officer ml sposito 
david donze of new orleans who dressed as st michael the 
archangel complete with handmade feather wings and golden sandals 
said costuming for mardi gras made everyone a star 
its your turn to be seen by other people instead of watching 
the parade you are the parade you become the parade and the 
center of attention he said 
dozens of parades draw the focus to the carnival season with 15 
organizations on the streets all day uptown and downtown starting 
with the club called zulu which tossed painted coconuts and beads 
to the crowds 
next came rex the king of carnival with his parades down st 
charles avenue 
its new orleans mission to see to it that everyone in the 
world has plastic beads plastic cups and rubber chickens the 
stuff they throw from the parades is no good but everyone wants 
it said rita miller 
miller from suburban metairie and 20 of her friends all 
dressed as clowns had a frontrow seat for the parades spectators 
15 deep lined the route behind them clamoring for the trinkets 
thrown from the floats 
in contrast dozens of christian evangelists carried signs and 
handed out religious leaflets as they worked the crowds 
our motto is save a soul dont catch the beads said laura 
patterson of new york

the priest who founded covenant house the 
nations largest organization for runaway youths resigned tuesday 
after months of disputing allegations of sexual misconduct 
the controversy that has surrounded me for the past three 
months has made it impossible for me to lead covenant house 
effectively the rev bruce ritter said in a statement 
frank macchiarola the former city schools chancellor who served 
as acting president while the allegations were investigated also 
resigned 
macchiarola who was named acting president feb 7 said in a 
statement he was resigning because the shelters board of directors 
had voted against his proposals for the future of covenant house 
a spokeswoman for macchiarola maureen connelly said he was not 
available for interviews but said macchiarola had wanted to conduct 
reviews investigations and audits of current practices and make 
changes 
james j harnett executive vice president and chief operating 
officer will take over the shelter until a permanent successor to 
ritter is found the organization said in a statement 
in an interview harnett said he expected that the international 
search for a successor to the franciscan priest would probably take 
months and would be limited to roman catholic nuns brothers and 
priests 
the focus has got to be on the needs of the kids he said 
covenant house is not one man its not me its not father 
ritter he was not all of covenant house 
harnett 43 said the shelter board accepted macchiarolas 
recommendations and plans to bring in outside consultants to 
revamp operating procedures 
the charges against ritter first arose in december when the new 
york post quoted a onetime male prostitute as saying he had had an 
affair with ritter over several months last year the young mans 
father defended ritter calling his son an emotionally troubled 
liar covenant house later conceded that it had provided the young 
man kevin kite with a new identity using a birth certificate of 
a 10yearold boy who died in 1980 without permission from the 
childs parents 
earlier this year three more young men were quoted in published 
reports as saying they had had affairs with ritter 
ritter a man who was once celebrated by president reagan as a 
hero and who served on the meese commission on pornography has 
called the accusations against him garbage 
covenant house began in 1968 when ritter now 62 put a few 
runaways up in his apartment it now serves 25000 youths annually 
at 17 shelters in the united states canada and latin america 
nearly all of its 85 millionayear budget is funded by private 
donations 
in letters to potential donors ritter detailed the lives of 
youths who left abusive homes for a street life of drugs and 
prostitution but finally found peace at covenant house 
since the controversy about ritter began contributions were 
said to have fallen off 
harnett said the controversies of recent months have been very 
upsetting to the kids and the kids are going to be very upset by 
this decision of ritter leaving 
but his vision his courage and determination remain 
harnett said

social and economic stability

an actor portrays jesus in an unusual 
paid television commercial here seeking to boost attendance at an 
innercity united methodist church 
the pastor the rev craig a hunter decided something more was 
needed than the typical come visit us appeals used by churches 
in such efforts 
with the help of a local advertising firm he put together two 
30second spots using an actor portraying jesus christ 
in one spot jesus is sitting silently and alone in a pew 
in the other he is being led through a church door by a young girl 
to our knowledge this is the first church in the nation that 
has ever used an actor to portray jesus in a television 
commercial said hunter senior pastor of richard brown memorial 
united methodist church 
the commercials which state theres a very special spirit in 
this church and that it has a few seats left and one of them 
is for you began airing in midfebruary on tv stations in this 
city of about 110000 people 
hunter said its too soon to gauge the sentiments of the public 
and other churches but hes braced for criticism 
armed with a 6000 grant from the east ohio conference of the 
united methodist church hunter visited local market and media 
specialist vic rubenstein who offered his services for free and 
persuaded an area production crew and ohio actor john galgosi to 
make the commercial at cost 
one sunday last month hunter cut short the church service and 
crews wheeled in a fog machine lights movie camera and other 
equipment they filmed two commercials in about four hours 
one begins with the sound of a heartbeat and features a young 
man nodding off in a pew he is the only person in the church 
which appears misty 
as the camera closes in on the man a voiceover says some 
churches are kind of empty others are kind of staid others are 
very sleepy 
he awakes and his image fades then becomes the likeness of 
jesus with a small halo around his head the camera pulls back and 
he is surrounded by congregation members 
in the other commercial a narrator portrays a visitor speaking 
to his wife as he walks around inside the church 
this is some special church martha the man says as the 
camera scans people in classes and other activities the man notes 
the different races and backgrounds of members and says there is 
something special going here 
just then a little girl walks through the door holding the hand 
of jesus who scans the activities and smiles slightly and 
approvingly 
the character of jesus played by galgosi 37 does not speak in 
either commercial galgosi a darkcomplexioned caucasian with 
brown eyes and long brown curly hair wears a robe in the spots 
the church bought some of the local commercial time other spots 
are given free by stations as public service announcements 
rubenstein said the church qualifies because it is nonprofit he 
said 
the first rule of marketing is one of positioning of 
separating your product and your service from the rest said 
rubenstein who attends a synagogue across the street from hunters 
church 
rubenstein said the richard brown church seemed special to him 
because of its mix of people 
you see the blacks and the whites the wealthy the poor the 
very secure intellectual university group the 
handicapped who else but a spirit could bring these kinds of 
people together 
the churchs stone structure built in 1915 is near the 
youngstown state university campus hunter said membership reached 
about 500 in the 1950s but residents migration to the suburbs has 
cut the congregation to about 200 
hunter and rubenstein said most of the calls they have received 
since the ads ran have been positive 
i warned craig i said believe me be prepared for the 
flak rubenstein said i dont think weve really experienced 
that backlash yet 
richard l rustad pastor of boardman united methodist church 
one of the citys larger methodist churches said he saw no 
problems with the commercials 
we believe speaking as a person in a mainline church not 
only in historical jesus but in the present christ and it seems 
like theyre trying to indicate that the person and presence of 
christ can be found within that congregation rustad said in 
fact its creative its good 
its a very interesting church over there because its very 
heterogeneous he said of the richard brown congregation i 
think if christ were to come back that may be the very kind of 
place youd find him

if you harbor any doubts that life is a 
business stop and consider the recordkeeping work that the 
government requires of the 100 millionplus people who pay us 
income taxes 
the assignment starts with but is by no means limited to 
filing a tax return on time each year the rules also require you 
to be ready to support that return with documents on just about any 
question that the internal revenue service might raise 
so even people who farm out their tax affairs to paid advisers 
often find themselves with boxes or file drawers full of records 
that threaten to overflow 
at this time of year especially the issue tends to arise how 
long must one hang onto all those canceled checks from some year in 
the administration of president ford is there any simple system to 
use in determining when to throw old tax records away 
the short answers to those questions in order are it 
depends and probably not but cumbersome as the process of 
tax recordkeeping may be experts on the subject say it need not 
be totally unmanageable 
the basic rule of thumb is that all documents related to tax 
matters should be kept for a minimum of three years after the date 
on which a return is filed or due whichever comes later 
that is the standard period in which the government has a legal 
right to take action on your return 
the limitation period stretches to six years in cases where it 
is determined that a taxpayer failed to report income amounting to 
25 percent or more of the total listed on any years return 
as a matter of course we recommend that you keep all your 
canceled checks for six years says the accounting firm of ernst 
amp young in this years edition of its arthur young tax guide 
before you toss your pile of 1979 records in the trash bin 
furthermore advisers suggest that you give some thought to a few 
other eventualities 
for one thing in cases of fraud or failure to file any return 
the statute of limitations may extend indefinitely 
additionally you might give the documents a quick review before 
pitching them to see if they contain any information of lasting 
relevance 
that applies in particular to anything that might affect the 
cost basis of property you own that you might one day sell at a 
capital gain subject to tax 
suppose you installed new kitchen cabinets in your home in 1979 
proof of expenses for such lasting improvements can lower the tax 
you might owe when the time comes to sell the house 
or to put it the other way around an absence of such proof 
might well mean that you have to pay far more in taxes when you 
sell than the law would otherwise have required 
for a variety of purposes tax specialists generally agree that 
you should keep copies of your yearly tax returns indefinitely 
kmpg peat warwick accountants suggest another reason to curb 
any instinct you feel to get rid of tax records as soon as possible 
occasionally new tax legislation that benefits the individual 
is made effective retroactively this may provide the opportunity 
to file an amended tax return and collect a refund but only if 
you have the appropriate records

theres no couch in psychiatrist lia dobrayas 
office at the salvation army adult rehabilitation center just a 
couple of straightbacked chairs a metal desk and some file 
cabinets 
but the doctor who spent the first 27 years of her career in the 
soviet union calls the office her palace and to the downtrodden 
who come through the door to try to beat drug or alcohol addiction 
its a trip toward sobriety 
the happiest moment really of my life in america was when 
the salvation army hired me said dobraya a therapist at the 
126bed center the past year 
dobraya is one of 11 clinical staffers at the salvation armys 
largest drug and alcohol rehabilitation center in the country 
this was something she wanted to do she came to us said 
the centers administrator maj robert bodine one of her first 
thoughts when she came to the united states was to somehow be 
involved with the salvation army in terms of reflecting her own 
values in wanting to be involved with people and to help them 
the christianoriented charitable agency wraps the spiritual 
approach into the educational and clinical aspects of treating at 
no charge alcoholics and drug addicts 
dr dobraya had a great deal of experience in treating 
alcoholism and drug addiction in the soviet union said dr 
edward lataille the centers director of clinical services a 
lot of that skill is transferrable here 
with her background and experience of oppression shes able 
to understand perhaps some of the pain and hardships that many 
of the centers patients have experienced he said 
some 450 people a year go through the centers sixmonth 
residential treatment program about 40 percent of whom overcome 
their addiction lataille said 
the patients average age is 34 and they cross the social 
spectrum the one thing they have in common is that alcohol or 
drugs have shattered their lives often to the point where theyre 
living on the street 
many of our people have been so devastated by the disease of 
alcoholism or drug addiction that theyve lost medical insurance 
theyve lost family and dont have money or insurance to pay for 
treatment so were treating a population that would otherwise not 
be treated lataille said 
a graduate of odessas medical institute dobraya went into 
psychiatry after an internship at a mental hospital exposed her to 
the sadness of mental disease and chemical dependency 
i thought i must help them she said 
and though failures often outnumber successful treatments the 
success stories make the job worthwhile 
its hard but its a big happiness when you can see you can 
help these people said dobraya 
like the united states the soviet union has severe problems 
with substance abuse she described alcoholism as the soviet 
unions no 1 health problem and drug abuse once dismissed as a 
capitalistic phenomenon as an emerging social problem 
because religion was frowned upon in the soviet union doctors 
were forbidden from introducing it as a theraputic tool for 
recovering susbstance abusers 
rather dobraya said techniques including hypnosis group and 
individual psychotherapy and medications were emphasized in the 
soviet union but she estimated that more than 80 percent of the 
soviets treated for alcoholism return to drinking 
now dobraya 51 is free to appeal to the souls of our 
clients as a way to help them toward sobriety 
the people in the program are happy and from a psychiatric 
point of view i know it works for them more than any education or 
medication she said 
in the soviet union before recent reforms allowing more 
religious freedom there was no possibility to even think about a 
christian approach or spiritual approach she said 
even if i could have used that approach many could not 
understand it because they grew up without religion they believed 
in a false religion this false religion was created on blood the 
blood of millions of people 
philosophical differences with the soviet state and the way its 
secret police manipulated psychiatry in the past to suppress 
dissent also motivated her november 1988 emigration to the united 
states 
she was allowed to leave with her husband vladimir a 
48yearold software engineer when emigration policies were 
loosened their two adult sons a daughterinlaw and a 
granddaughter stayed behind although dobraya hopes to one day be 
reunited with them in america 
i like and appreciate this country and its people who are 
very kind and good and calm she said there are not so many 
irritated people even among our clients who have emotional 
problems the soviet people are kind of survivors they are it 
seems almost in a permanent state of tension

so tell me about yourself the census 
bureau is about to ask americans a bit like an eager young man in 
a singles bar 
both suitor and statistician think they already know some of the 
answers but inevitably both will hear things they didnt expect 
there were some surprises in 1980 and we also expect some 
surprises in 1990 says william p butz associate director of 
the census bureau 
there are things we think are happening but come the 90 
census well find that some of that is wrong butz acknowledges 
what surprises are likely 
with census day set for april 1 and months of effort to follow 
in compiling and analyzing the numbers butz says simply i dont 
know yet 
while the census bureau takes a national head count only once 
every 10 years it is constantly taking sample surveys and has a 
pretty good idea of whats going on with the nations 
quarterbillion people 
the 1990 census will find not only a bigger population than in 
1980 but one that is different in many ways americans are older 
live in different places have a larger ethnic component and have 
changed socially and economically in the last decade 
anticipating what the april count will find heres a look at 
the census bureaus most recent estimates 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the us population was estimated at 2496 million as of jan 1 
and should be close to 250 million by april 1 up from 2265 
million in 1980 
the first census in 1790 counted 39 million people thats 
just slightly more than now live in the dallasfort worth area

hispanics now make a big dent in americas consciousness having 
increased to more than 20 million people as they flooded into the 
country in recent years 
hispanics now account for 84 percent of the population up from 
64 percent in the 1980 census 
that means hispanics are growing faster than the general 
population 
immigration accounted for about half of the overall gain 
said carmen denavas of the census bureau since 1982 the central 
and south american population here has grown 67 percent 
the location and characteristics of immigrants will be of 
interest this time butz said 
in 1980 the bureau was surprised at the lack of education among 
haitian immigrants for example and it located some unexpected 
pockets of new arrivals 
the nations racial breakdown also is changing 
in 1980 859 percent of americans were white 117 percent were 
black and 23 percent were asian or members of other races 
estimates for 1990 anticipate the white share will be down to 842 
percent with blacks up to 124 percent and asians and others 
rising to 34 percent 
the 1980s appear to be the first decade in at least 100 years 
when more blacks moved to the south than left it and the census 
hopes to learn more about that trend butz said 
getting an accurate county of minorities is an important effort 
this time since studies of the 1980 census concluded blacks were 
missed more often than whites

families including a married couple account for just 56 percent 
of all households down from 61 percent in 1980 and 70 percent in 
1970 reflecting the growth in single people and oneparent 
families 
family size also has been declining as people have fewer 
children in 1980 there were 79 youths aged 18 and under for every 
100 families by 1989 that was down to 69 
the 1990 count may find the decline in childbearing is easing 
however as women who put off having families to complete schooling 
and start careers decide to have children 
we are seeing significant changes in the number of women in 
their 30s having children women are postponing their first births 
and opting for more education and more time in the labor force 
says amara bachu a census bureau statistician 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the growth of singleparent families stemming from divorce also 
has allowed for more remarriages hence the number of stepchildren 
grew to 68 million by 1985 up 15 percent from 1980 it it 
expected to prove even higher in 1990 
historically there have been far fewer children in oneparent 
homes with more of those children in homes headed by a widowed 
rather than divorced parent says arlene saluter of the census 
bureau

wives earnings were increasing at twice the rate of husbands 
in the 1980s but wives still earn half of what their husbands 
bring home 
from 1980 to 1987 wives earnings rose 23 percent compared to 
a 12 percent growth for their husbands but wives still averaged 
13250 compared to 29150 for their husbands

boom generation matures 
the median age of the united states hit 30 in 1980 grew to 321

median means that half of all americans are older than that age and 
half younger

in addition to moving to the south and the west americans have 
been concentrating growth in metropolitan areas in the 1980s in

americans are better educated than ever before thanks largely 
to the educational efforts of the baby boom generation 
the 1990 census is expected to show 777 percent of men and 769 
percent of women aged 25 and over have completed high school and 
219 percent of men and 156 percent of women are college 
graduates american demographics magazine says 
by contrast in 1980 677 percent of men were high school grads 
and 203 percent had finished college for women the 662 percent 
had finished high school and 129 percent held college degrees 
but those gains may not continue 
men aged 25 to 34 are now less likely to have completed 
college than were the baby boomers ten years ago the high cost of 
education may be pushing young adults out of college and into the

the importers of evian bottled water are 
launching a new advertising campaign this week even as the importer 
of a rival bottled water perrier announced its drink may be back 
in circulation within two months 
evian importers point out that their new advertising has been in 
development since june and that timing of the campaign was decided 
long before source perrier sa recalled bottles of its flagship 
brand earlier this month 
the new evian ads make no reference at all to the the perrier 
recall which followed the discovery that some perrier bottles were 
contaminated with traces of a toxic chemical benzene 
we are not trying to capitalize on the perrier recall said 
maryanne farrell senior marketing manager for evian waters of 
france inc based in greenwich conn its unfortunate for 
perrier that it happened 
but timing of the evian campaign is opportune nonetheless 
grocers and restuarant owners have had to scramble to find 
replacements for perrier the third bestselling bottled water in 
the us since its feb 9 recall here 
orders for lacroix sparkling water have quadrupled according to 
lacroix water co based in la crosse wis the company says it 
boosted production by 50 percent to 60 percent a day to meet demand 
saratoga springs mineral water co in saratoga springs ny 
another evian company has noted a marked increase in sales of its 
saratoga natural sparkling water since perrier was recalled on feb 
9 in the united states 
they have sold in a weeks time what they normally sell in a 
month she said the production day has been lengthened 50 
percent to meet demand 
and canadian shield spring water co based in sault ste marie 
ontario canada said the recall has meant more demand for its 
canadian spring premium sparkling water even as the company was 
expanding distribution nationally after test marketing it in the 
upper midwest and northeast for the past 2 years 
we have had to put new distributors on hold while meeting 
increased demand from current distributors said spokeswoman helen 
gillespie 
perrier which insists it acted responsibly in ordering the 
worldwide recall said monday in paris that its recall was nearly 
complete 
its us arm perrier group of america inc said new safeguards 
are being put in place and it was expected the perrier brand will 
be on the shelves within six to eight weeks 
evian sales figures since the recall are not yet available said 
evians ms farrell and she noted that noncarbonated evian is not 
directly comparable to the bubbly perrier which is often used on 
social occasions 
the company refused to comment on spending plans but trade 
reports indicate evian plans to spend about 6 million on its ad 
campaign in 1990 up about 50 percent from last year 
the campaign includes commercials that debuted monday on 
television stations in new york and los angeles and will be run 
next month in san francisco washington dc miami philadelphia 
and san diego 
the ads shot in hawaii and yosemite national park in 
california show mountains lakes and trees and active people 
basking in the natural beauty and drinking evian which is 
described as natures gift 
in one commercial the viewer sees the dawn breaking through a 
wooded area where a man runs a woman stretches her leg muscles and 
a bicyclist rides 
morning 365 chances a year to do something healthy a 
narrator says like morning the narrator adds evian is always 
there for you to do something healthy 
evian also is running a print ad in eight major newspapers that 
runs an unusually long 2500 words and is called just a drop of 
what you should know about water in which it tells consumers why 
their bodies need water 
hellen berry market research director at beverage marketing 
corp in new york said local or regional brands are benefitting 
from perriers absence 
but perrier group is filling the void as well with its own 
domestic sparkling water brands 
spokeswoman jane lazgin said perrier is able to offer store 
owners replacements such as poland spring in the northeast 
calistoga and arrowhead in california and ozarka in texas 
we have had real sound business relationships with these 
retailers for 1012 years and we are retaining much of our space

pilots at trump shuttle the northeast airline 
service named after the billionaire developer who bought it last 
june have ratified a new contract agreement 
the fouryear contract was approved by the pilots over the 
weekend and announced by the airline monday it provides for wage 
increases averaging 10 percent this year and a total 15 percent 
over the next three years 
the contract also makes changes in work rules to allow greater 
scheduling flexibility and calls for the pilots to begin sharing 
increased costs of medical benefits in 1991 
nearly all the 227 pilots at trump shuttle which links new york 
with boston and washington formerly worked for eastern airlines 
real estate tycoon donald trump bought the shuttle service from 
miamibased eastern for 365 million 
ray grebey the shuttles chief labor negotiator said in a 
statement that the new agreement reflects the unique nature of 
hourly shuttle operations 
the wage hike for this year which depends on a pilots rank and 
averages 10 percent was effective feb 19 trump shuttle 
spokeswoman joan fudala said 
she said the changes in work rules will allow standby shuttle 
crews for example to be assigned to fly charter flights when 
passenger traffic doesnt require additional shuttle flights 
the new contract also replaces a twotiered wage structure for 
pilots with a single tier ms fudala said starting pay for all 
new pilots will be 26400 a year 
the contract calls for a retroactive 8 percent wage increase for 
july 18 1989 through jan 1 1990 for all pilots who formerly 
worked for eastern the wage hike reflects the result of 
arbitration between eastern management and the pilots 
trump shuttle pilots belong to the air line pilots association 
one of three unions that struck eastern last march pushing it into 
bankruptcy court reorganization eastern pilots and flight 
attendants halted their sympathy strikes last november but the 
machinists union is continuing its walkout 
contract negotiations covering the 280 flight attendants at 
trump shuttle are due to start around april 1 ms fudala said 
talks with machinists have been postponed pending a challenge from 
a rival group the aircraft mechanics fraternal association which

with a handshake and the passing of a set of 
keys ford motor co marked a change of leadership and the 
introduction of a new escort that the company says is a prototype 
of its global manufacturing strategy 
chairman donald petersen sat at the wheel and his designated 
successor vice chairman harold red poling rode alongside as 
the nations no 2 automaker on monday rolled the first production 
model of its 1991 escort a bright red twodoor off the line at 
its wayne assembly plant 
the car poling said is a sign of fords commitment to 
building small cars here in the united states 
with the closing earlier this month of no 3 chrysler corps 
jefferson avenue assembly plant in detroit ford became the only 
one of the big three that makes subcompacts in the united states 
sales leader general motors corp gets its small cars mostly 
grouped under the geo nameplate from japanese makers or joint 
ventures in the united states and canada 
nevertheless fords new subcompact relies heavily on japanese 
knowhow mazda motor corp which is 25percent owned by ford 
designed the car and has helped ford gear up its escort plant using 
japanese production techniques and equipment 
mondays ceremony took place in the newly renovated wayne 
assembly plant its loaded with japanese influences ranging from 
the obvious huge komatsu stamping presses to the notsoobvious 
a method of manufacturing strikingly similar to that used at 
mazdas assembly plant in flat rock south of detroit 
petersen and poling who will take over as chairman when 
petersen retires thursday after more than 40 years with the 
company said the escort project shows how ford is integrating its 
worldwide manufacturing business in asia europe and north america 
ford is investing 2 billion into the project codenamed ct20 
which also involves production of the mercury tracer at the 
companys plant in hermosillo mexico 
part of the project involves the 900 or so wayne stamping and 
body assembly employees who work under whats called a modern 
operating agreement a manufacturing method using small teams of 
workers with the ability to perform several tasks 
it is fords only such agreement in operation gm and chrysler 
have similar programs at a variety of their operations 
the ford agreement was patterned after programs at japanese 
plants including mazdas flat rock factory which makes the ford 
probe 
as at mazdas only us assembly plant workers at fords wayne 
stamping plant wear identical uniforms and coordinate their jobs 
through the use of teams 
automakers said the concept improves contact between management 
and employees and helps productivity by encouraging employees to 
suggest how a job can be performed better 
perhaps this will be a new way of doing business said kevin 
mcguinness an industrial engineer who now works in the new 
stamping operation linked to the main assembly plant 
the united auto workers union has said there is a danger in the 
team concept eroding the traditional labormanagement relationship 
although poling said the escort itself would be unprofitable 
ford is pinning a lot on the subcompact 
the company needs the vehicle to help it meet government fuel 
economy standards which sets average mileage standards that each 
automakers fleet must meet the more escorts it sells the more 
lowmileage highprofit midand fullsize cars ford can sell 
without incurring any government penalties

soliciting shareholder votes to oust lockheed corps board of 
directors and has hired consultants on both coasts to help 
in a filing with federal regulators monday simmons disclosed 
that he also wants to eliminate lockheeds shareholders rights 
plan also known as a poison pill defense 
that rights plan would make it prohibitively expensive for 
anyone to buy more than 20 percent of the companys common stock 
simmons has an 189 percent stake 
the filing with the securities and exchange commission also 
disclosed that nl industries has hired new york investment bankers 
salomon brothers inc as a proxy solicitor and jefferies amp company 
inc a los angelesbased firm as a consultant in the proxy battle 
nl agreed to pay salomon 150000 per month and jefferies 
100000 per month in addition the filing disclosed that it would 
retain salomon as a financial adviser and investment banker for a 
year if the proxy fight succeeds toward that end nl paid salomon 
750000 up front and agreed to pay mutually agreed upon fees 
from time to time 
a letter to lockheed included in the sec filing blasted the 
californiabased defense contractor for reportedly announcing the 
date of its annual meeting at a time designed to hamper nl 
industries incs bid to unseat the board 
under company bylaws shareholders have 10 days from the public 
announcement of the meetings date to submit proxy statements for 
consideration at the meeting 
nl industries a houston chemicals concern controlled by 
simmons said lockheed announced the march 29 meeting shortly after 
6 pm on feb 16 
by announcing the shareholders meeting after the close of 
business on a friday preceding a threeday holiday weekend 
lockheeds management effectively gave nl just five business days 
to prepare its nomination materials nl industries president j 
landis martin wrote lockheed 
we hope that managements conduct in connection with the 
announcement of the annual meeting does not mean that we are in for 
five weeks of manipulation of lockheeds corporate machinery 
martin added 
a lockheed spokesman ron meder said the company had no comment 
on martins allegations 
simmons of dallas revealed his 15 board nominees last 
thursday they include himself martin former sen john g tower 
a texas republican and elmo r zumwalt jr a retired admiral and 
former chief of naval operations 
all the nominees on simmons slate with the exception of 
himself martin and michael snetzer president of valhi inc 
another simmons controlled company will be paid 20000 apiece if 
they are not elected according to the filing 
simmons decided to launch a proxy fight after lockheed chairman 
daniel m tellep rebuffed his request for board representation

honda motor cos chief executive officer says 
the automaker has no immediate plans to make vehicles in the 
emerging eastern european market although it is preparing to sell 
a usmade station wagon in europe 
we are fully aware that major changes are taking place 
unfortunately however we are not very well versed in situations 
in eastern europe tadashi kume said monday he was in detroit to 
accept an award from automotive industries magazine 
honda spokesman shin tanaka said its too early to make a 
judgment 
other automakers including general motors corp and suzuki 
motor co already have signed deals to bring manufacturing into 
eastern europe and other companies are considering moves into the 
region 
honda is preparing to begin exporting to europe a usmade 
accord station wagon kume said 
perhaps in the nottoodistant future the accord wagon would 
be produced at the ohio plant and would be the first car we would 
be shipping from the united states to europe said kume 
there is debate about whether usmade hondas should be 
classified as japanese or us vehicles as five of the 12 european 
community nations have stiff barriers on importing japanese cars 
france and italy are pushing for ecwide quotas to restrict all 
japanese cars regardless of where the vehicles are built but kume 
said he doesnt expect honda to run into problems 
we would hope they end up with a very amicable conclusion 
he said 
honda will begin making the accord wagon at its assembly plant 
in marysville ohio later this year for the 1991 model year 
hondas marysville plant now makes its civic and accord models 
the honda accord was the bestselling car in the united states 
last year the first time a car with a japanese companys nameplate 
topped the bestseller list honda sold 362707 of the cars in 
1989 topping the ford taurus at 348061 
late last year honda began civic production at a new plant in 
east liberty ohio making honda the only japanbased company with 
two assembly plants in the united states 
by 1992 honda will more than double its production at the east 
liberty plant to 150000 cars a year while production of about 
360000 cars a year will continue at marysville said honda 
spokesman aki kato 
of those about 50000 cars will be shipped to japan from the 
united states other cars including the accord wagon will be 
shipped across the atlantic

to reduce its stake in shearson to below 50 percent so it could 
remove the troubled broker from its balance sheet and reduce its 
exposure to the sharp profits swings of wall street 
it sounds like american express is going to take over shearson 
lock stock and barrel said perrin long a brokerage industry 
analyst for lipper analytical securities corp 
the new plan will boost american express stake in shearson by 
an undetermined amount said american express spokesman matt stover 
it replaces a previous plan to shore up shearsons finances that 
would have reduced american express stake in the broker to about 
45 percent from 61 percent currently 
under the abandoned plan shearson would have sold 250 million 
worth of stock to its existing shareholders american express had 
planned to distribute its quota of shearson shares to american 
express shareholders 
the shearson share offering was dropped in light of unsettled 
conditions affecting the securities industry american express 
said in a statement 
in addition to the chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by the parent of 
drexel burnham lambert inc profits at many wall street firms have 
been pressured by a drop in merger activity and securities 
underwriting and sluggish stock and bond trading since the october 
1987 crash 
just last week first boston corp issued statements denying 
that it was under pressure because of loans to troubled buyout 
companies and last month merrill lynch amp co reported a 213 
million loss for 1989 after taking a heft 470 million charge to 
cover layoffs and costcutting 
asked whether the new plan represented a change of heart stover 
said american express always had a commitment to shearson 
what we are doing with our action today is making a very 
clear unequivocal strong statement of our support of shearson for 
the long term he said 
this is an industry where client confidence is of utmost 
importance he added there are times that you need to send a 
stronger signal 
long said the brokerages earnings volatility still makes it 
unattractive to american express in the long run 
the longerterm strategy at american express is to get 
shearson into much better operating condition and then one way or 
the other get themselves out of shearson altogether he said 
the latest move by american express represents the second major 
change in a month in its plan to bail out shearson which has been 
under pressure to raise its capital levels 
late last month shearson scrapped a plan to sell stock to the 
public to raise cash after its stock price declined sharply 
that move came in the wake of the sudden resignation under 
pressure of shearsons chairman peter a cohen 
shearson needs capital because of the threat of a ratings 
downgrade by creditrating agencies 
last fall moodys investors service inc said it was 
considering downgrading shearsons rating because of the firms low 
capital level weak profits and exposure to commercial real estate 
loans and investments as well as the overall securities industry 
slump 
like other securities firms shearson finances much of its 
activity with borrowed money a ratings downgrade would raise its 
costs by forcing it to pay greater interest on its borrowings 
under the new plan american express will buy a combination of 
common and preferred shearson stock worth 750 million the common 
stock will be bought at 11 a share 
shearson stock closed unchanged monday at 1087 a share in new 
york stock exchange trading american express disclosed its plans 
after the stock market closed 
analysts say much of shearsons trouble stems from overexpansion 
during cohens reign shearson grew from a mediumsized retail 
outfit to a diversified brokerage by acquiring investment banking 
firm lehman brothers kuhn loeb in 1984 and retail brokerage ef 
hutton amp co in 1988 
cohen was replaced by howard l clark jr chief financial 
officer and executive vice president of american express clarks 
father was american express chairman before current chairman james 
d robinson 
analysts interpreted clarks appointment as a sign that american 
express wanted to run the troubled brokerage directly the new 
recapitalization plan appears to be another move in that direction

while prices have plunged on the tokyo stock 
exchange in recent days traders and the government have been 
playing a waiting game on the key question of interest rates 
many analysts believe the government must raise rates to cool 
the inflationary fears that many believe are underlying the 
markets jitters but a rate increase could unsettle the market 
further because higher rates make stocks less attractive 
uncertainty hurts the market an interest rate increase will 
hurt the market the question is which will hurt more said 
robert alan feldman an economist for salomon brothers asian 
subsidiary 
the tokyo stock exchange suffered its secondworst daily drop 
ever on monday with the 225share nikkei stock average falling 45 
percent the key market index has dropped about 14 percent since 
reaching record highs at the end of 1989 
the index rallied 17 percent today after swinging sharply 
during the session 
many analysts and dealers are convinced that the bank of japans 
only option to help settle the market is to raise interest rates 
for weeks market speculation has been that japans central bank 
would raise its discount rate the interest it charges for loans to 
commercial banks 
analysts say such a move is needed to curb inflation which has 
been heralded by a rapidly increasing money supply and a severe 
labor shortage and to cool high stock and land prices that many 
see as signs of economic overheating 
expectations were that the move would follow the feb 18 
parliamentary elections it didnt and analysts attributed the 
major stock market slide that began the next day to uncertainties 
over interest rates 
in an interview monday bank of japan governor yasushi mieno 
reiterated the banks cautious stance on another increase in the 
discount rate which was raised three times last year 
now we have to see how these rising interest rates from last 
year will affect the economy we hope for a favorable result but 
if we find that the measures we have taken so far are not enough 
then we will have to move into the next step he said 
we are also listening to the views which we hear in the 
markets that if we raised the rate again at a time when stock 
prices are declining so sharply it would push the market further 
down he said 
feldman and others who urge an interest rate hike acknowledge 
that such a move might not immediately stop the fall on tokyos 
stock market interest rate increases tend to lower demand for 
stock shares because of the prospect that higher borrowing costs 
will hamper corporate earnings 
but feldman contended an interest rate boost would stabilize 
the japanese yen and will be a basis for calming down 
many analysts believe a vicious cycle of cheap yen cheap 
stocks and cheap bonds is behind the turmoil in the tokyo markets 
the decline of each one has accelerated the decline of the 
other two said johsen takahashi director of mitsubishi research 
institute inc 
if an interest rate increase strengthens the yen these analysts 
say that ultimately will break the cycle the weakening japanese 
currency has declined by 413 yen against the us dollar in the 
last five trading days the dollar closed monday at 14865 yen 
as long as they bank of japan are waiting to help maintain 
the pursestrings of the ministry of finance theyll screw up the 
rest of us said doug schumway a trader for jardine fleming 
securities

share prices on the tokyo stock exchange bounced 
back moderately tuesday one day after the markets main index 
suffered its secondworst plunge ever while the dollar rose 
slightly 
the dollar closed at 14903 yen up 038 yen after opening at 
14830 yen the currency ranged between 1481014950 yen the 
dollar has gained 456 yen in the last six trading days 
the dollar remained relatively firm against the yen despite the 
bank of japans intermittent dollarselling intervention to prop up 
the declining yen by selling dollars traders said the 
intervention amounted to some 2 billion the japan broadcasting 
corp said 
the yen remained weak and the demand for dollars strong since 
japans economic fundamentals have remained constant said bank of 
tokyo trader masato hayashi 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues recouped 57608 
points or 173 percent closing at 3389795 
on monday the index fell 156910 points or 45 percent to 
close at 3332187 the loss was second only to the 383648 plunge 
of oct 20 1987 after wall streets black monday that fall 
of 149 percent however was less than new yorks black monday 
plunge of 226 percent 
while the yen remained weak demand for dollars is strong said 
hayashi 
on monday the dollar rose 218 yen closing at 14865 yen the 
dollar has gained 413 yen the last five trading days 
dealers initially attributed the nikkeis recovery to market 
players optimistic prospects that the index had hit bottom as 
well as an overnight rise of 38 points in new yorks dow jones 
industrial average 
market players are still a little bit cautious but they 
started picking up issues that had fallen and i think the plunge 
more or less stopped at least just for now said masahiro 
umemori an analyst with nomura securities co 
he said the markets initial recovery was in part encouraged by 
investors expectations that the bank of japan would not raise its 
official discount rate 
it is considered unwise for the central bank to raise its 
discount rate when the stock market has been deteriorating 
analysts said 
higher interest rates discourage stock investment 
on the currency market the dollar was slightly lower following 
its slip on overseas markets traders said 
meanwhile the tokyo stock exchange disclosed it had asked 10 
securities firms both japanese and foreign to limit orders for 
indexlinked arbitrage selling prior to the beginning of the 
morning and afternoon sessions 
but there will be no penalty for not following the request said 
tokyo stock exchange spokesman hironobu takahashi 
it is all right to do arbitrage deals when the index is rising 
like today but arbitrage selling will accelerate the market plunge 
when the market is weak he said 
the purpose was to ask our member companies to cooperate and 
save the market and whether to take cooperative actions or not is 
all up to the companies takahashi said 
finance minister ryutaro hashimoto said he will watch if the 
stock exchanges measures are effective in stabilizing the market 
the stock exchange also eased its restrictions on credited 
buying and reduced safety deposit money to 40 percent from 50 
percent he added 
such measures began with tuesdays trading

a striped shellfish now clogging water system 
pipelines and threatening the ecological balance of the great lakes 
could make its way to rivers around the country in as little as 
five years scientists say 
the rapidly producing zebra mussels could pose a significant 
problem for manufacturing plants many of which have miles of pipes 
that draw cooling water the experts warn 
the mussels eventually will attach themselves to the insides of 
pipes supplying factories and municipal water plants in some cases 
restricting flow in the allegheny ohio and monongahela rivers 
said thomas nalepa a biologist with the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration 
the mississippi river basin also is vulnerable because lake 
michigan where the mussels are expected to arrive soon is 
connected to the mississippi by the chicago canal 
however there is no reliable way to determine exactly when the 
1inch mollusk will arrive in these or other rivers around the 
country scientists said 
zebra mussels so named because of their brown and white zigzag 
stripes have been found in lake erie lake ontario and lake st 
clair near detroit 
they are growing on spawning reefs favored by walleye 
smallmouth bass and other fish in western lake erie raising 
concern about the future of a valuable fishery 
like barnacles zebra mussels can travel by clinging to boat 
hulls they can survive out of water for perhaps up to 14 days by 
living on internal moisture 
lets say someone from pittsburgh were to trailer their boat 
up to fish on lake erie and ended up with zebra mussels that 
attached to their hull said david kelch a specialist with ohio 
state universitys sea grant program 
they take their boat back to pittsburgh and in a day or two 
put the boat into a river or lake in that area youve got them 
whats more the larvae or young which are microscopic in 
size easily can attach themselves to an anglers minnow bucket a 
water nook in a boat trailer or the feathers of a duck 
the zebra mussel originated in the black and caspian seas 
between europe and asia in 200 years it has spread through much 
of europe two years ago it was discovered in lake st clair and 
has infested water intakes for erie toledo cleveland and monroe 
mich 
the mussel reproduces at an astonishing rate a single female 
produces as many as 40000 eggs each breeding season 
the mollusk also has a voracious appetite for phytoplankton 
which are microscopic floating plants that form the bottom of the 
food chain mussels could reduce the supply of phytoplankton for 
microscopic animals called zooplankton the zooplankton in turn 
are eaten by smaller fish which are eaten for food by larger fish 
anytime you impact the basic bottom building block of the food 
chain youre going to see an impact on the top predators 
walleye smallmouth bass yellow perch kelch said

k mart corp apparently aiming to match its 
competitors slicker more contemporary stores plans to take a 
640 million pretax charge against fourthquarter results to cover 
the cost of a huge modernization program 
k mart officials said monday the 23 billion program to open 
new stores and modernize existing ones will take about five years 
company spokesman orren knauer declined to estimate k marts 
1989 earnings which are to be announced march 8 but analysts with 
seidleramdec securities inc of los angeles calif predicted k 
mart earnings would be about 730 million for the year below the 
8029 million it earned in 1988 
the nations secondlargest retailer after sears roebuck and 
co will open about 250 new stores during the fiveyear program 
knauer said 
k mart plans to close 30 of its 2194 us stores refurbish or 
expand 1880 stores and relocate 280 the only three stores left 
out of the k mart plan already have the new look knauer said 
tom tashjian analyst with seidleramdec said k mart was 
slipping behind competitors walmart and target in the discount 
retail market the latter two chains expanded more recently than k 
mart 
all the companies are about 25 years old but k marts 
expansion was early on in that period tashjian said the 
others have expanded during the latter part of the 25 years so they 
have younger betterlooking stores target is much more fun to 
shop in 
k mart reported in november a 175percent drop in thirdquarter 
profits to 1041 million from a year earlier the drop was blamed 
on price cuts made to improve the companys market share 
but knauer denied that k mart decided to embark on the 
fiveyear billiondollar plan in response to its competition 
we made the decision because of internal factors he said 
citing an 18month pilot project during which several stores were 
renovated or moved it was based on christmas sales and the 
success of stores where weve already made changes 
in the enlarged relocated and prototyped stores customer 
acceptance of the layouts fixturing and new merchandise 
assortments has been very good and sales results have exceeded 
expectations 
k mart chairman joseph antonini said the store enlargements and 
relocations should be completed by 1993 and other refurbishments 
will be done by 1994 
k mart is taking a far more aggressive approach to modernize 
their stores than they were planning before tashjian said the 
walmart and target chains are clearly better at merchandise 
presentation than k mart at this time 
k mart has 4171 outlets in the us puerto rico and canada 
including 2288 k mart stores 1258 waldenbooks 141 builders 
square and 282 pay less drug stores the troybased company also 
purchased pace membership warehouse inc for 322 million late last 
year

chrysler corp is seeking federal 
government permission to sell and lease back its unfinished 1 
billion technical center a move that would give the automaker a 
needed cash infusion 
chrysler chairman lee iacocca has estimated the nations no 3 
automaker invested about 1 billion in the research and engineering 
center north of detroit in auburn hills company officials maintain 
the chrysler technology center is crucial to the automakers future 
but some critics contend that chrysler which lost 664 million 
in the fourth quarter of 1989 cant afford the facility the 
fourthquarter loss which included 577 million in writeoffs for 
auto plants chrysler is closing was the companys first quarterly 
deficit since 1982

japanese automaker mitsubishi motors corp for an aftertax profit 
of 310 million in november chrysler said it was considering a 
sale and lease back on the technical center to raise cash needed

earlier this month the company sold its gulfstream aerospace 
subsidiary for 825 million 
according to the request filed monday with the securities and 
exchange commission auburn hills trust organized with the 
assistance of manufacturers hanover bank proposes a public 
offering of about 800 million in securities money that would be 
used to pay for chryslers interest in the technical center 
auburn hills trust then would assign the lease to a third 
company auburn hills trust services which in turn would rent the 
property back to chrysler and provide maintenance and other 
services under a longterm contract 
i know the papers were filed today thats about all i know

the us trade deficit narrowed to 1132 
billion last year its lowest level since 1984 as exports of 
manufactured products and farm goods posted sizable gains the 
government reported today 
the commerce department said that the increased exports helped 
overcome a continued increase in imports last year as the country 
improved its trading position with almost every nation 
the 1132 billion deficit was an 11 percent improvement from a 
1272 billion deficit in 1988 it stemmed from a 134 percent rise 
in exports which climbed to a record 3619 billion this offset a 
64 percent increase in imports which also hit an alltime high of 
4751 billion 
the trade deficit is the difference between imports and exports 
todays report on merchandise trade as calculated on a balance 
of payments basis confirmed an improvement already noted in the 
commerce departments monthly merchandise trade reports the totals 
are slightly different because the new report excludes military 
sales by the us government and makes other minor adjustments in 
the monthly figures 
for the fourth quarter the trade deficit posted an increase of 
09 percent to 288 billion following a deficirt of 286 billion 
in the third quarter 
this marked the second consecutive quarter in which the us 
trade deficit failed to improve a trend analysts have termed 
worrisome given the fact that the annual deficit remains stuck 
above 100 billion 
economists have expressed fears that the deficit could begin 
deteriorating again in 1990 which would be a blow to president 
bushs economic goals the administration is hoping that further 
sizable gains in exports will spur a resurgence in the us 
manufacturing sector which has fallen on hard times in the past 
year particularly in the key auto industry 
in the fourth quarter exports climbed 16 percent to 921 
billion but this gain was offset by a 14 percent gain in imports 
which rose to 1209 billion both imports and exports were at 
record levels in the final three months of the year the sixth 
consecutive quarter they have set new highs 
for the year nonfarm exports were up 14 percent to 3204 
billion reflecting widespread increases especially in capital 
goods 
us farm sales increased 9 percent to 414 billion the volume 
of shipments of corn wheat and sobybeans jumped 24 percent to 
record levels with onehalf of that increase coming in higher 
sales to the soviet union 
the trade gains were held back however by a giant 28 percent 
jump in petroleum imports which rose to 503 billion the highest 
level since 1985 the average price per barrel increased to 1708 
up from 1434 the number of barrels imported daily increased to 
806 million the highest level since 1979 a year in which 
shortages prompted long lines at gasoline pumps 
nonpetroleum imports were also up last year rising 4 percent 
to 4249 billion with the largest increases coming in capital 
goods and consumer goods however imports of cars from japan 
declined for the third consecutive year reflecting in part the 
fact that more japanese models are being manufactured in plants 
located in the united states

the holding company of federated department 
stores inc and allied stores corp is working on an employee 
retention plan for executives who might be tempted to join a rival 
retailer 
the plan being developed by federated stores inc must be 
approved by us bankruptcy judge j vincent aug jr before it goes 
into effect 
federated and allied two us retailing businesses owned by 
canadas campeau corp filed for protection from creditors under 
chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law on jan 15 in the biggest 
retail bankruptcy filing in history 
carol sanger spokeswoman for the us holding company said 
today the plan will consist of various performance and retention 
incentives and a reaffirmation of contracts and other benefits 
she declined to be more specific but said the plan would not 
include salary increases for executives or improvements in health 
coverage 
the employee retention plan will be presented to aug in early 
march ms sanger said 
these are benefits which will keep us competitive with other 
executives in the retail industry ms sanger said we do not 
want to lose anybody to another retailer 
analysts said employee retention plans are commonplace in the 
competitive retailing industry theyre aimed at preventing 
executives from upper management to divisional officers from 
jumping to rival stores 
those executives usually at the middlemanagement level who 
shine are always in demand said marc p schappell of egon 
zehnder international a new yorkbased management recruitment firm 
ms sanger said the plan is a necessary step for federated 
we cannot operate at a severe disadvantage in this environment 
that were dealing in it would not be in the companies best 
interest she said 
so far federated and allied executives havent left in large 
numbers according to management recruitment firms 
they see themselves as being on the first team said roger 
kenny of kenny kindler hunt amp howe a new york recruiting firm 
why leave the yankees to go to the farm team 
the companies have taken several steps since filing the chapter 
11 petition five weeks ago aug has approved a special 700 million 
financial package that provided fresh lines of credit to the 
companies 
several businessasusual motions from retention of 
employee benefits to allowing distributors to resume liquor 
shipments to a downtown chicago bloomingdales store have been 
approved 
and about 96 percent of the stores top 117 merchandise

the founder of crazy eddie inc faces 
criminal contempt charges after he failed to appear today before a 
federal judge to answer demands he return 52 million to the united 
states 
judge nicholas h politan ordered us marshals to bring eddie 
antar before him and said a civil trial against antar and two 
family members would proceed without the reclusive founder 
politan set a may 1 trial date for antar his brother mitchell 
and his cousin sam e antar all charged with securities 
violations 
the securities and exchange commission claims in a lawsuit the 
missing money may have been gained through insider trading 
jack arseneault antars attorney told the judge he did not 
know antars whereabouts the judge ordered a closed hearing today 
to question arseneault further about antars whereabouts 
earlier this month politan ordered antar to repatriate the 
money by feb 7 but antar refused through his attorney citing his 
fifth amendment right against selfincrimination 
antar allegedly transferred the 52 million in 1987 to bank 
accounts in israel arseneault has argued that to return the money 
would be selfincriminating because it would be tantamount to an 
admission that the money is there politan has rejected that 
argument 
politan had ordered antar on feb 7 to appear in person if he 
was going to use the fifth amendment two days later politan 
issued an arrest warrant on civil contempt charges after antar 
failed to show 
at the time an angry politan ordered marshals to spare no 
expense to capture antar antar turned himself in to marshals on 
feb 13 
he was released and was to appear today 
the sec said in its lawsuit antar directed a financial fraud to 
falsify the companys income and reaped illegal profits through 
the sale of his stock at artificially inflated prices the 43store 
empire collapsed last year

the boeing co did not violate a federal 
conflictofinterest law when the defense contractor paid 485000 
in severance to five employees who left to take government jobs 
the supreme court ruled today 
by a 90 vote the justices overturned a ruling supported by 
the bush administration that the money must be turned over to the 
government 
justice john paul stevens writing for the court said the 
payments give rise to a possible appearance of impropriety 
but he said the conflictofinterest law also permits 
corporations to encourage qualified employees to make their 
special skills available to the government 
as long as the employee has not begun working for the 
government the law does not prohibit the payment stevens said 
he said any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of government 
contractors and employees receiving severance pay until congress 
plainly states that we have misconstrued the law 
the law makes it a crime for any private party to pay and a 
government employee to receive supplemental compensation for the 
employees government service the statute is one of many federal 
laws aimed at prevent bribery graft and conflicts of interest 
todays decision reversed a 1988 ruling by the 4th us circuit 
court of appeals that said boeing paid the money illegally to the 
employees to compensate them for taking lowerpaying jobs in the 
reagan administration 
the bush administration urged the supreme court to uphold the 
appeals court ruling 
justice department lawyers said the payments were classic 
violations of federal law because they were calculated to make up 
the difference between the employees salaries at boeing and their 
government pay 
in seattle boeing spokesman paul binder said the company was 
pleased by the decision and feels vindicated after almost eight 
years of legal questions surrounding the payments 
the payments compensated employees for accrued sick leave 
unused benefits and stock options and were always completely open 
and aboveboard and disclosed to the government he said 
its not only a victory for boeing but a victory for the 
government because it means that qualified people will not feel 
impeded in taking their industrydeveloped experience and expertise 
in to government positions binder added 
boeing stopped making such payments following the initial legal 
challenge the company needs to study the high courts decision 
before deciding whether to resume them binder said 
the five former employees are 
thomas k jones who received 132000 from boeing before 
becoming deputy undersecretary of defense for strategic and theater 
nuclear forces in 1981 herbert a reynolds 80000 deputy 
director of space and intelligence policy in 1981 melvin r 
paisley 183000 assistant secretary of the navy for research 
engineering and systems in 1981 
also lawrence h crandon 40000 a computer scientist for the 
nato air command and control systems in 1982 and harold kitson 
50000 deputy assistant secretary of the navy for command 
communications and control intelligence in 1982 
the former employees said in their appeal to the supreme court 
that they were not responsible for pentagon contracting or 
procurement and that they had exemplary records with the government 
they said there was no question of divided loyalties for any of 
them because each received an irrevocable severance payment 
before entering government service 
paisley became a defense consultant after leaving the pentagon 
in 1987 his name arose in a justice department investigation of 
trafficking in confidential bid information on government 
contracts but he was never charged criminally 
his lawyers in response to court documents denied that paisley 
violated the law 
the cases are crandon vs us 88931 and boeing vs us 
88938

foreign secretary douglas hurd said tuesday the 
european community should offer the countries of eastern europe 
which have shed communism an association agreement which would 
eventually lead to full membership 
i do not know on what basis that full membership could be 
denied once they have achieved full democracy and market 
economies hurd told 3000 members of the institute of directors 
britains main employers group at their annual convention 
the foreign secretary said the 12nation european community 
should offer each eastern european country an association 
agreement which can gradually be increased and enriched as that 
country moves forward with its political and economic reforms 
hurd said the european community needed to respond to the 
liberalized eastern bloc by holding out a hand not only of 
friendship but of practical help and cooperation 
he said the countries of eastern europe seem to have grasped 
the need to adopt policies which would lead to an enterprise 
culture and creation of wealth with remarkable speed 
answering questions hurd said countries such as romania and 
bulgaria had a long way to go before they could become full ec 
members but he also noted that greece spain and portugal had all 
joined the european community after getting rid of dictatorial 
governments 
hurd also urged british firms to get in on the ground floor 
as eastern governments turned towards capitalism citing an 
immense expansion of markets for goods and services

actions by japans financial regulators and stock 
exchange officials to calm troubled markets in recent days appeared 
sometimes contradictory and in many cases ineffective traders and 
analysts said tuesday 
stock prices plunged on a day when officials asked stock market 
participants to limit program trading some have blamed for 
worsening recent price declines 
the government also has intervened in the currency markets to 
support the value of the japanese yen and in the bond market to 
push interest rates lower which tends to depress the yen 
regulators are trying to settle a tokyo stock exchange whose key 
index has plunged by 14 percent this year partly due to worries 
about rising inflation and higher interest rates 
on monday the exchange asked securities houses to limit 
arbitrage dealings whe the stock market is declining arbitrage 
programs involving rapid trading of huge numbers of shares to 
profit from price discrepancies between stocks and stockindex 
futures has been blamed for worsening price declines 
but with arbitragers inactive monday the stock market took its 
biggest plunge since the october 1987 crash on tuesday despite 
some 201 million worth of arbitrageselling and a temporary 
decline the benchmark nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues 
closed 57608 points higher 
it is rather difficult to evaluate the market reaction from 
just one day of trading stock exchange spokesman hironobu 
takahashi said tuesday but i believe our member firms understood 
our request and tried to cooperate 
new yorkbased salomon brothers one of the leading arbitrage 
firms in tokyo stated tuesday that the action taken yesterday 
may do more harm than good it does not address the fundamental 
factors driving the market 
all the fingerpointing at arbitrage is wrong said kevin 
parker director of futures and options at morgan stanley another 
big american arbitrage player less than 5 percent of daily 
volume has been arbitrageselling it cant really explain the 
correction in the market 
parker said market fundamentals such as rising interest rates 
and inflation accounted for the downturn 
these problems have been the target of divergent actions by the 
finance ministry and the bank of japan 
the finance ministry primarily is interested with protecting 
government bond prices thereby curbing interest rate rises and 
promoting economic expansion said jason james a strategic analyst 
with james capel pacific however the central bank is concerned 
with battling inflation and supporting the value of the yen which 
are achieved by raising interest rates james said 
the ministry also reportedly was concerned that higher interest 
rates would cause japanese investments to flow back from overseas 
particularly from the united states 
the finance ministry has intervened three times in the last 
week its first bond market intervention since 1987 purchasing 
604 million worth of 10year government bonds on monday in an 
attempt to raise their prices and reduce their yields 
mondays intervention reduced yields on the benchmark 10year 
government bond to 6875 percent from a high of 7015 percent 
however the ministry stayed out of the market tuesday and the 
yield climbed to 691 percent 
bond dealer shinji kokubun of sanwa bank suggested the ministry 
may have to spend a lot more to get the job done 
the finance ministrys buying operation does not have an 
immediate effect as far as i know it works gradually he said 
the ministrys efforts may aid the stock and bond markets but 
they seemed to diverge from the central banks moves to depress 
interest rates 
bank of japan governor yasushi mieno on monday refused to rule 
out a widely anticipated increase in the banks official discount 
rate to battle inflation 
we dont change monetary policy only because stock prices 
or the yen move rapidly we have to consider carefully what the 
interest rate increases will bring how prices will change in the 
future he said 
the central bank regards the discount rate the interest it 
charges commercial banks for loans as a key weapon against 
inflation it raised the rate three times in 1989 bringing it from 
25 percent to the present 425 percent but inflation continues to 
threaten due to rising oil and labor prices 
the central banks currency operations its other weapon against 
inflation also have been hindered by market forces 
the bank reportedly spent 2 billion tuesday to bolster the yen 
but the dollar rose 038 yen and closed at 14903 yen its highest 
level since last june 15 the weaker yen makes imported items such 
as oil more expensive in japan

the us trade deficit narrowed to 1132 
billion last year the smallest since 1984 despite the highest 
level of foreign oil imports in 10 years the government reported 
tuesday 
the commerce department said the deficit shrank by 11 percent 
from an imbalance of 1272 billion in 1988 reflecting continued 
growth in american exports especially manufactured goods and 
agricultural products 
the 134 percent increase in exports which rose to a record 
3619 billion more than offset a 64 percent gain in imports 
which also hit an alltime high of 4751 billion 
tuesdays report on merchandise trade as calculated on a balance 
of payments basis confirmed trends already noted in the 
departments monthly merchandise trade reports which showed a 
deficit for all of 1989 of 1086 billion 
the new figure is higher because it excludes military sales by 
the us government and makes other minor adjustments in the 
monthly figures 
for the fourth quarter the trade deficit posted an increase of 
09 percent to 288 billion following a deficit of 286 billion 
in the third quarter 
it marked the second consecutive quarter in which the trade 
deficit failed to show improvement and private economists 
expressed fears that the deficit could begin widening again in 1990 
a higher trade deficit would spell trouble for the bush 
administration which is counting on further export growth to prop 
up the us economy 
one of the most ominous signs for the future is the surge in oil 
imports which shot up 28 percent last year to 503 billion the 
price per barrel rose to 1708 up from 1434 in 1988 while the 
number of barrels imported daily increased to 806 million the 
highest level since 1979 a year in which americans sat in gasoline 
lines because of shortages 
nonpetroleum imports were also up last year rising 4 percent 
to 4249 billion car imports from japan declined for the third 
consecutive year reflecting the fact that more japanese models are 
being manufactured in plants located in the united states 
nonfarm exports were up 14 percent to 3204 billion last year 
reflecting increases in consumer goods and manufactured capital 
goods especially commercial aircraft 
us farm sales increased 9 percent to 414 billion the volume 
of shipments of corn wheat and soybeans jumped 24 percent to 
record levels with onehalf of that increase coming in higher 
sales to the soviet union the government reported 
in the fourth quarter exports climbed 16 percent to 921 
billion but this was offset by a 14 percent increase in imports 
which rose to 1209 billion both imports and exports were at 
record levels in the final three months of the year the sixth 
consecutive quarter they have set new highs 
but paul getman an economist with regional financial 
associates said that us export growth for manufactured goods is 
likely to slow in coming months reflecting higher interest rates 
in such countries as japan and west germany higher interest rates 
dampen demand by raising the cost of borrowing for both businesses 
and consumers 
the 1132 billion trade deficit for 1989 was the smallest 
imbalance since a 1125 billion deficit in 1984 the first year 
that the trade deficit climbed above the 100 billion mark

lotus development corp on tuesday unveiled a 
longpromised version of its popular 123 computer spreadsheet 
program for ibm mainframe computers 
the program 123m allows personal computer users to pull 
data from a mainframe computer file and transfer it directly into 
the 123 spreadsheet 
lotus and international business machines corp said the 
software could cut days off the the traditional procedure in which 
data from a mainframe often must be altered so that it may be 
entered into a 123 spreadsheet on a personal computer 
spreadsheet programs allow the display of rows and columns of 
figures or bar graphs to represent such things as a companys sales 
or profits they are among the most popular programs for personal 
computers and 123 is the leading personal computer spreadsheet 
the move into mainframes represents the second foray by the 
cambridge massbased company into software for other types of 
computers last month lotus introduced a spreadsheet program for 
workstations made by sun microsystems inc it also is believed to 
be developing a version of 123 for minicomputers made by digital 
equipment corp 
lotus and ibm signed an agreement in april 1987 to jointly 
develop a spreadsheet program for ibm mainframes the program 
originally was to be released in early 1988 other versions of 
123 also have suffered lengthy introduction delays due to 
programming bugs and other problems 
at a news conference lotus vice president frank moss said one 
possible use for 123m would be for a retailstore chain to 
transfer sales data from spreadsheets on personal computers in its 
stores to a mainframe computer at company headquarters 
ibm said sears roebuck and co is one of about two dozen 
companies that have been using a preliminary version of 123m 
since august 
users do not need to know the computer commands for the 
mainframe computer the lotus program automatically transfers data 
from personal computers to the mainframe and vice versa 
during the delay in introducing 123m a new type of computer 
setup may have reduced the need for the product some industry 
analysts say that setup involves a file server a highpowered 
desktop computer that acts as a central repository for a network of 
personal computers existing versions of 123 can run on file 
servers 
however rick sherlund an analyst at goldman sachs amp co said 
the new version of 123 should appeal to companies that have a 
mainframe computer in place and want to tie it to personal 
computers through the spreadsheet 
sherlund said 123m should account for less than 5 million of 
lotus estimated 1990 revenue of 750 million but he said its 
more significant from a strategic vantage point since it should 
allow lotus to maintain its foothold in major corporations 
their strategy i think is to basically cover all their bases 
and offer products that run across the broad spectrum of hardware 
installed in corporate america he said 
ibm will be the sole marketer of the program which is designed 
for use on ibms system370 computer line sherlund said he 
believes lotus will receive less than half the revenue 
the software which will be available next month ranges in 
price from about 15000 to 48000 depending on the size of the 
computer system in addition monthly licensing charges of 583 to 
1800 are assessed the companies said

dogged by an unclear corporate image greyhound 
corp announced tuesday it is changing its name to greyhound dial 
corp to distinguish itself from the troubled nationwide greyhound 
busline that it formerly owned 
this name change will help clarify who we are and what we 
do greyhound dial chairman john w teets told a news conference 
in new york 
the company a diversified manufacturing and financial services 
concern based in phoenix sold the bus line in 1987 to dallas 
investor fred currey who later merged it with the trailways bus 
system and renamed the operation greyhound lines inc its drivers 
have threatened to strike on friday in a wage dispute 
teets said the new name was chosen because of the importance of 
the companys dial corp subsidiary a consumer products maker with 
brands ranging from dial soap to purex detergents to lunch bucket 
microwave meals 
he said the word greyhound was retained as part of the name 
because it is an integral part of the name of several other 
subsidiaries such as greyhound financial corp and greyhound food 
management 
for the corporation to abandon the greyhound name would be a 
genuine blow to these companies he said 
the companys board of directors approved the name change on 
feb 15 
clive chajet an expert on corporate name changes said the 
company is attempting to redefine the word greyhound to be more 
than a bus service 
greyhound as a bus service is a well engrained symbol he 
said 
name changes usually are an expression of a companys longterm 
strategy rather than a reaction to a specific event said chajet 
the chairman of lippincott amp margulies inc a corporate image 
consulting firm 
asked why the company had waited until now to make the name 
change teets said it had been studying such a move for a few 
years but the threatened strike at greyhound lines was kind of 
the last grain of sand in the hourglass 
he didnt rule out eliminating the word greyhound from the 
company name in the future 
as a reflection of the confusion caused by the greyhound name 
teets said the companys switchboard had been deluged with calls 
from the press seeking details about the possible bus strike the 
company also was concerned that institutional investors might think 
it was involved in the strike 
were not involved in any way at all teets said he 
declined to comment on the bus lines labor trouble 
greyhound was primarily known for its bus service until 1987 
when it sold the line to currey for 270 million its main 
businesses now are consumer products financial services and

benetton group spa announced tuesday that the 
federal trade commission has closed an investigation into the 
fairness of certain us business practices of the italian apparel 
maker and retailer 
the ftc informed benetton in a letter feb 5 that the matter had 
been closed and that it wouldnt initiate any proceedings against 
the company benetton said 
the investigation which began in late 1988 first came to light 
last june benetton disclosed in a prospectus for a sale of 
securities in the united states that the regulatory agency had 
undertaken a preliminary probe 
the government probe had been aimed at determining whether 
benetton should be considered a franchiser and therefore subject to 
federal franchise rules it focused on the companys relationships 
with owners of benetton boutiques in the united states 
benetton said in a news release it was gratified that the ftc 
has decided not to take action against the company benetton 
consistently maintained throughout the investigation that it wasnt 
a franchiser under the ftc definition and that it had not engaged 
in unfair or deceptive business practices 
a violation of franchise rules can result in civil penalties of 
up to 10000 a day the ftc also has the power to seek civil 
remedies in court on behalf of owners investors or others 
a number of us store owners previously alleged in bankruptcy 
court proceedings that benetton had acted unfairly and violated 
franchise rules and other statutes 
one store owner had threatened to file a class action lawsuit on 
behalf of all owners that have challenged the way benetton does 
business 
federal law requires franchisers to make detailed disclosures 
before selling a franchise franchisers must obey various federal 
laws intended to protect business owners from abusive practices 
some states also have statutes that apply specifically to 
franchisors 
benetton markets its colorful clothing for women men and 
children through independently owned benetton retail stores there 
are more than 700 benetton stores in the united states

placing further limits on tobacco and alcohol 
advertising could push more sports programming from broadcast 
television to paytv outlets drive some magazines out of business 
and eliminate thousands of jobs in the media industry a new report 
said tuesday 
critics said the report failed to reflect the possibility that 
other advertisers likely would fill any void left by a decline in 
tobacco and alcohol products advertising 
the report was released by a group of advertisers media 
companies and ad agencies called the leadership council on 
advertising issues whose stated goal is to preserve and enhance 
the freedom to advertise 
our study shows that reduced advertising exacts social and 
economic penalties from the public said reginald brack the time 
warner inc executive who is cochairman of the group 
he said the study was not prompted by any specific legislation 
although there have been periodic calls for new limits on tobacco 
and liquor ads 
an author of the report said he hoped the findings would inject 
some discussion of social and economic costs into the debate over 
whether to further limit advertising of tobacco beer wine and 
liquor

japanese automakers praised for quickly 
developing new cars are so fast in bringing out some new products 
that they blur distinctions between two models of the same car 
outgoing ford motor co chairman donald petersen said tuesday 
petersen steps down thursday as leader of the worlds 
secondlargest automaker at a time that ford and other us 
companies retrench operations as their market shrinks and as they 
struggle to curb costs 
one costsaving area for us automakers is to cut the time for 
developing a new car and bring it to dealers the big three have 
been taking leads from their associations with japanese companies 
to reduce that time 
petersen whose company is in ventures with mazda motor corp 
and nissan motor co ltd of japan said theres risk in being too 
fast 
the japanese are changing their rate that isnt necessarily 
doing them a lot of good i dont think im abnormal in my 
inability to identify one car from another said petersen who 
has worked in the industry for nearly 41 years 
one company considered to have an exceptionally quick product 
cycle time is honda motor co ltd yet its 1990 accord which honda 
advertises as an entirely new vehicle has been criticized for not 
being distinctive enough from earlier models 
petersen became ford president in 1980 at the nadir of the 
companys fiscal troubles and took over as chairman and chief 
executive officer on feb 1 1985 
in 1980 ford lost 15 billion petersen led ford out of its 
slump aided by the marketing of such popular vehicles as the 
taurus and the company posted an industryrecord 53 billion 
profit in 1988 
petersen is departing as the us auto industry struggles to 
hold down costs in a diminishing market that is threatened more 
than ever by cars made by japanese companies overseas and in the 
united states 
petersen said he wanted to be remembered at ford for his work in 
developing a nostar system 
i wanted people to have a sense of teamwork he said since 
petersen has been chairman and with influence from mazda ford has 
begun adapting a japanese teamoriented manufacturing method 
ford owns 25 percent of mazda and gets its probe cars from 
mazdas plant in flat rock mich later this year ford will make 
the mazda navajo sportutility vehicles at its plant in louisville 
ky 
but when asked outside of ford which automaker he most admired 
petersen said toyota motor corp 
they have a very complex product line he said they are a 
very big company and sell in very high volume there are others 
companies but they are more limited in their product line 
im extraordinarily impressed with the west german bmw 
petersen said and the other company that impresses me is 
frances peugeot i think their cars are beautifully designed 
taking over for petersen is vice chairman harold poling who 
will be chairman for three years speculation is that executive 
vice president alan gilmour who becomes president of the ford 
automotive group on thursday will succeed poling 
during the next 18 months general motors corp chairman roger 
b smith and chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca also will step 
aside

the delaware supreme court in a written 
decision resulting from last years timewarnerparamount takeover 
battle on tuesday affirmed the right of a board of directors to 
determine the future course of a company 
the ruling came seven months after the states highest court 
upheld a chancery court decision allowing time inc to proceed with 
its 14 billion takeover of warner communications inc and barring 
paramount communications inc and time stockholders from 
interfering with the deal 
the case was heard in delaware because all three companies 
like many of the biggest us corporations are incorporated 
there and is seen as likely to affect other future merger 
proposals 
the plaintiffs had sought to force the time board to consider 
paramounts 122 billion bid which would have given time 
stockholders 200 a share in cash 
but delawares highest court said a board of directors 
while always required to act in an informed manner is not under 
any per se duty to maximize shareholder value in the shortterm 
even in the context of a takeover 
in march 1989 time and warner announced plans to merge in a 
friendly exchange of stock but in june less than three weeks 
before shareholders were to vote on the deal paramount launched a 
hostile 107 billion bid that it later sweetened to 122 billion 
time and warner countered by amending their plans to provide for 
times 14 billion tender offer for warner in chancery court in 
delaware chancellor william t allen decided in favor of time and 
warner 
the supreme court sustained allens ruling in an oral decision 
in late july saying it would issue a written opinion in the future 
time and warner completed their merger on jan 10 
in his ruling allen gave corporate directors wider latitude in 
defending against unwanted takeover bids while affirming his 
decision the supreme court disagreed with his concern about 
paramounts attempt to disrupt times longrange plans 
we think it unwise to place undue emphasis upon longterm vs 
shortterm corporate strategy justice henry r horsey wrote 
in an 82page decision 
directors generally are obliged to charter a course for a 
corporation which is in its best interest without regard to a fixed 
investment horizon horsey said 
paramount and time shareholders contended that time essentially 
put itself up for sale with its initial warner merger agreement 
partly on grounds that warner shareholders at that time would have 
ended up holding more than 60 percent of the stock in time warner 
inc 
they argued that control of time effectively would be 
transferred to the warner shareholders and under a 1986 delaware 
supreme court ruling resulting from the takeover of revlon inc 
the time board should have considered the paramount bid 
but the supreme court agreed with allen that the time case did 
not meet the requirements of the revlon case horsey cited the 
absence of any substantial evidence to conclude that times board 
in negotiating with warner made the dissolution or breakup of the 
corporate entity inevitable as was the case in revlon 
revlon applies when a corporation initiates an active bidding 
process seeking to sell itself or to effect a business 
reorganization involving a clear breakup of the company horsey 
wrote 
the revlon standards also apply when in response to a 
bidders offer a target company abandons its longterm strategy 
and seeks an alternative stratey also involving the breakup of the 
company he wrote adding that neither of these scenarios applied 
to the time case 
the plaintiffs also contended that times tender offer for 
warner put the company up for sale but horsey wrote the tender 
offer was a reasonable defensive response and not an abandonment of 
times continued existence 
paramount had sought to portray times tender offer as an 
unreasonable defense aimed at forcing the timewarner merger onto 
shareholders the supreme court responded by giving directors more 
leeway in deciding whether an offer poses a threat to a company 
its shareholders workers or surrounding community 
horsey told the plaintiffs that a court cannot be involved in 
substituting its judgment for what is a better deal or that of 
a corporations board of directors 
he also said there was nothing to stop paramount from pursuing 
the combined time warner inc 
the case also was heard by justices randy j holland and andrew 
gt moore ii

energy futures prices fell tuesday as a bid to 
extend the previous sessions rally faltered late in the day 
analysts attributed the pullback to expectations that oil and 
unleaded gasoline inventories are growing a recognition that 
prices of the benchmark grade of us crude are high relative to 
those available on comparable grades overseas and to profittaking 
following mondays rally 
the april contract for west texas intermediate the key grade of 
us crude oil lost 21 cents to close at 2158 a 42gallon barrel 
on the new york mercantile exchange after rising 37 cents a barrel 
on monday later contracts also finished lower on tuesday 
refined products traded on the new york merc also fell

no 2 heating oil for march delivery fell 089 cent a gallon 
after rising 075 cent on monday later contracts were down by 
smaller amounts 
tom bentz director of futures trading at united energy inc 
said prices moved higher early in the session in an extension of 
mondays move 
but he said prices headed lower late in the session led by 
unleaded gasoline prices 
he said gasoline prices have been under pressure for several

the holding company seeing federated 
department stores inc and allied stores corp through chapter 11 
reorganizations wants to seek us bankruptcy court approval for a 
plan to retain executives 
carol sanger a spokeswoman for federated stores inc holding 
company for the us retailing operations of torontobased campeau 
corp said tuesday the proposal designed to keep executives from 
leaving to join rival retailers is still being developed 
it would apply to ranks from senior management all the way down 
to middlelevel executives in merchandising and similar jobs within 
the federated and allied store groups ms sanger said 
she said the proposal may not be ready to be submitted at the 
next hearing scheduled march 15 before judge j vincent aug jr 
who is overseeing the federated and allied bankruptcy cases and 
must approve expenditures but the proposal could be added to the 
agenda if it is completed 
theres still plenty of time to add things to the calendar 
ms sanger said 
she said the plan will consist of various performance and 
retention incentives and a reaffirmation of contracts and other 
benefits she declined to be specific about whether salary 
increases or improved benefits might be offered 
lewis rosenbloom a lawyer for federateds unsecured creditors 
including major merchandise suppliers and factoring companies that 
serve as middlemen between suppliers and stores said federated has 
not made any details of its proposal available to the creditors he 
said he did not know enough about the proposal to say whether the 
creditors would support it 
we are told that the plan will be disclosed march 1 at a 
meeting in new york itll be the first opportunity we have to look 
at it rosenbloom said i am aware of it we have no details 
whatsoever 
rosenbloom said the creditors recognize the need to provide 
incentives designed to retain key managers from leaving to join 
other firms during the chapter 11 reorganization but he said the 
creditors would want part of the managers compensation and 
benefits tied to emergence of federated and allied from chapter 11 
and to the ultimate dividend payable to unsecured creditors 
federated and allied both based in cincinnati filed their 
chapter 11 petitions jan 15 listing a total of 77 billion in 
debts the companies were saddled with the debt when campeau 
purchased them in 1986 and 1988 
the companies are developing reorganization plans while under 
bankruptcy court protection from creditors

more than doubled for its latest fiscal year as annual sales 
climbed to 36 billion 
the parent company of levi strauss amp co the worlds largest 
brandname clothing manufacturer disclosed its results as it began 
issuing stock to employees 
levi strauss said it earned 498 million in the fourth quarter 
on sales of 960 million for 1989 vs 103 million on sales of 
8219 million for 1988 
for the fiscal year ended last nov 26 the companys net income 
rose to 2723 million from 1119 million the year before 
the 1989 income exceeds the record earnings of 2237 million 
reported by the companys publicly held predecessor in 1980 
sales of 36 billion which increased for the third straight 
year rose 16 percent over 31 billion in 1988 
ninety percent of the companys stock is owned by about 100 
shareholders mostly from the haas family who took the company

match 50 percent of employees savings levi strauss said it 
expects employees to own up to 10 percent of the stock within five 
years the company employs 31000 worldwide 
the company attributed its strong performance to higher margins 
on increased sales the sale of a minority interest in the 
companys japanese subsidiary and a lower effective tax rate the

718 million 
international sales increased 22 percent to 12 billion in 1989 
and accounted for onethird of levis business domestic sales

the years results were achieved during a time of significant 
changes in the retail industry said robert d haas chairman and 
chief executive officer they reflect our success in focusing on 
our core jeans jeansrelated products and casual wear 
a big reason for the booming sales was the success of the 
dockers line of casual clothes introduced in late 1986 and 
designed for aging baby boomers who have outgrown jeans the total 
dockers wear for men women and now children accounted for 
nearly 400 million in sales in 1989 more than triple the 118 
million of the year before 
the company also said it had repaid most of the 16 billion 
debt from its leveraged buyout five years ago it said it reduced 
its debt to 475 million 
we feel weve been one of the most successful leveraged 
buyouts said george b james senior vice president and chief 
financial officer who noted the company is seven years ahead of 
schedule on repayment of its buyout debt 
last year all our businesses were setting records it was one 
of those years when nothing dragged us down a satisfying vintage 
year he said it was a good year to start our public

eastern airlines has asked the federal 
bankruptcy court to release 60 million from escrow to help finance 
its operations in march as the airlines continues attempting to 
reorganize as a smaller carrier 
eastern filed a request for the funds with us bankruptcy court 
in new york on monday company spokesman robin matell said tuesday 
from easterns headquarters in miami 
a hearing on the matter was scheduled for thursday the same day 
courtappointed bankruptcy examiner david i shapiro is due to 
report to the court on his monthslong investigation of eastern and 
its finances 
a committee representing easterns unsecured creditors mainly 
equipment suppliers such as aircraft and engine makers supported 
the airlines request 
attorneys for the air line pilots association and the striking 
machinists union opposed the request as they had easterns earlier 
petitions for cash the union lawyers have asked that every dollar 
withdrawn by eastern be matched by a contribution from its parent 
texas air corp 
eastern is asking that 60 million be taken out of escrow funds 
which contain around 550 million raised from separate sales of 
eastern assets since the airline filed for bankruptcy court 
protection last march 9 
a month ago us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland approved 
easterns request for 50 million to finance operations through the 
end of february that ruling was the fourth time lifland had 
approved an eastern request for funds bringing to 260 million the 
total withdrawn from escrow so far 
last week eastern reached agreement with the unsecured 
creditors on a new reorganization plan under which sister carrier 
continental airlines would make some payments to the creditors 
the unsecured creditors who are owed 980 million by eastern 
would receive about 490 million in cash and notes under the plan 
if the bankruptcy court approves the plan eastern says it could 
emerge from chapter 11 this summer 
eastern and continental are subsidiaries of houstonbased texas 
air the nations largest airline company easterns previous 
reorganization proposals did not involve the assistance of 
continental or texas air 
eastern still has not reached agreement with holders of its 
preferred shares who are owed about 1 billion the preferred 
holders objected to easterns earlier plan which would have paid 
them only 10 cents on the dollar and called for the liquidation or 
sale of the airline 
the airlines exclusive right to file a reorganization plan 
expired last tuesday 
the machinists union is continuing the strike it began against 
eastern last march 4 easterns pilots and flight attendants 
unions called off their sympathy walkouts last november but the 
airline had replaced the strikers mainly with nonunion workers as 
it rebuilt from the strike

the justice department announced a fivecount 
criminal indictment against exxon corp and its shipping subsidiary 
tuesday night in the exxon valdez oil spill that fouled alaskas 
coast nearly a year ago 
officials said that if the giant oil company is convicted on all 
counts brought by a federal grand jury in anchorage it could face 
criminal fines of as much as 16 million 
in addition the government could seek as much as 700 million 
more in penalties under a separate federal statute that allows 
recovery of twice the amount of proven losses caused by the spill 
the worst in the nations history the officials said 
in new york exxon chairman lawrence g rawl said in a 
statement we will defend ourselves in court against these 
charges we believe there is no statutory basis for the amount of 
the fines mentioned by the us attorney general 
rawl called the grounding a tragic accident for which both 
corporations have apologized to the american people especially the 
people of alaska nobody willfully grounded the ship or caused the 
spill 
attorney general dick thornburgh told a news conference that the 
indictment was presented to the grand jury after a proposed plea 
deal fell through state officials had strenuously objected to one 
proposed agreement 
the exxon valdez ran aground in prince william sound on march 
24 1989 and spilled more than 11 million gallons of crude into 
the pristine waters polluting hundreds of miles of alaska coastal 
waters and shoreline 
exxon has spent more than 2 billion in cleanup efforts but 
environmentalists argue that the job is far from complete and the 
total damages to natural resources may not be known for years 
assistant attorney general dick stewart said the grand jury 
indictment accused exxon corp and its shipping subsidiary of two 
felonies and three misdemeanors 
the felonies each of which carries a maximum fine of 500000 
accuse the company of violating the port and waterways safety act 
and the dangerous cargo act 
the latter charge alleges that exxon willfully and knowingly 
violated a regulation prohibiting any person from being engaged on 
a crew if such person is known to be physically or mentally 
incapable of performing his or her duties 
joseph hazelwood captain of the exxon valdez faces criminal 
charges in a separate action in alaska and is accused of being 
drunk and letting his ship get away from him 
the three misdemeanor counts accuse exxon of 
violating the clean water act by illegally discharging 
pollutants into prince william sound 
unlawfully discharging refuse the oil 
violating the migratory bird treaty act a count which stems 
from the deaths of more than 36000 birds as a result of oil 
pollution 
each of the misdemeanor counts carries a maximum penalty of 
200000 the justice officials said 
thornburgh said this indictment does not in any way affect 
the civil remedies that are available to the united states or the 
civil remedies that are available to the state of alaska or private 
parties 
civil suits have been filed by a number of environmental groups 
and the state 
as for a plea bargain thornburgh said we were approached by 
the prospective defendants now defendants the terms that we 
insisted upon were not acceptable to the defendants therefore we 
presented the case to a grand jury 
the plea bargain discussions resulted in sharp exchanges between 
alaska state officials and the justice department in recent weeks 
in a letter to justice last weekend alaska attorney general 
doug baily accused the department of trying to force the state into 
signing off on an agreement by threatening to withhold continued 
federal involvement in joint federalstate efforts to assess 
damages from the spill 
alaska gov steve cowper and baily expressed concern that the 
plea bargaining might handcuff state officials pursuing further 
civil actions against exxon to recoup damages 
after reviewing a draft agreement with exxon last week the 
state officials refused to go along with it largely because they 
said it would have hampered the states ability to obtain funds 
from exxon to restore natural resources damaged by the spill 
state officials questioned whether exxon would have had to pay 
adequate money into a staterun resource restoration fund they 
also maintained that some provisions of the proposed plea 
bargaining agreement might hamper civil suits

criminal indictment against exxon corp and its shipping subsidiary 
tuesday night in the exxon valdez oil spill that fouled alaskas 
coast nearly a year ago

that characterization it has some poetry to it anyway

counts brought by a federal grand jury in anchorage it could face 
criminal fines of as much as 16 million 
in addition the government could seek as much as 700 million 
more in penalties under a separate federal statute that allows 
recovery of twice the amount of proven losses caused by the spill 
the worst in the nations history the officials said 
when those damages have been calculated the department will 
bring civil suits against the company thornburgh said

statement we will defend ourselves in court against these 
charges we believe there is no statutory basis for the amount of 
the fines mentioned by the us attorney general

the exxon valdez ran aground in prince william sound on march 
24 1989 and spilled more than 11 million gallons of crude into 
the pristine waters polluting hundreds of miles of alaska coastal 
waters and shoreline 
exxon has spent more than 2 billion in cleanup efforts but 
environmentalists argue that the job is far from completed and the 
total damages to natural resources may not be known for years 
assistant attorney general dick stewart said the grand jury 
indictment accused exxon corp and its shipping subsidiary of two 
felonies and three misdemeanors 
the felonies each of which carries a maximum fine of 500000 
accuse the company of violating the port and waterways safety act 
and the dangerous cargo act 
the latter charge alleges that exxon willfully and knowingly 
violated a regulation prohibiting any person from being engaged on 
a crew if such person is known to be physically or mentally 
incapable of performing his or her duties 
joseph hazelwood captain of the exxon valdez faces criminal 
charges in a separate action in alaska and is accused of being 
drunk and letting his ship get away from him 
the three misdemeanor counts accuse exxon of 
violating the clean water act by illegally discharging 
pollutants into prince william sound 
unlawfully discharging refuse the oil 
violating the migratory bird treaty act a count which stems 
from the deaths of more than 36000 birds as a result of oil 
pollution 
each of the misdemeanor counts carries a maximum penalty of 
200000 the justice officials said 
thornburgh said this indictment does not in any way affect 
the civil remedies that are available to the united states or the 
civil remedies that are available to the state of alaska or private 
parties 
civil suits have been filed by a number of environmental groups 
and the state 
as for a plea bargain thornburgh said we were approached by 
the prospective defendants now defendants the terms that we 
insisted upon were not acceptable to the defendants therefore we 
presented the case to a grand jury 
the plea bargain discussions resulted in sharp exchanges between 
alaska state officials and the justice department in recent weeks 
in a letter to justice last weekend alaska attorney general 
doug baily accused the department of trying to force the state into 
signing off on an agreement by threatening to withhold continued 
federal involvement in joint federalstate efforts to assess 
damages from the spill 
alaska gov steve cowper and baily expressed concern that the 
plea bargaining might handcuff state officials pursuing further 
civil actions against exxon to recoup damages 
in comments telephoned to reporters in juneau from washington 
after the indictment was announced the governor was much gentler 
with the justice department 
i want to make it clear that i never thought the justice 
department was proceeding in bad faith i dont think that they 
meant to harm us in any way cowper said 
in fairness to justice they were in a box here they were not 
able to give us the full story because the law prohibits them from 
disclosing whats going on in a criminal action before an 
indictment 
though thornburgh was upset with the states public criticism 
cowper said we felt we had to defend our position 
cowper said he would withhold comment on the indictment until he 
could read it 
after reviewing a draft agreement with exxon last week the 
state officials refused to go along with it largely because they 
said it would have hampered the states ability to obtain funds 
from exxon to restore natural resources damaged by the spill 
state officials questioned whether exxon would have had to pay 
adequate money into a staterun resource restoration fund they 
also maintained that some provisions of the proposed plea 
bargaining agreement might hamper civil suits
