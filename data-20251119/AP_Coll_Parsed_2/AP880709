preliminary figures from mexicos 
presidential election show the ruling institutional revolutionary 
party candidate winning but with the lowest margin in its six 
decades in office 
federal electoral commission figures obtained from a reliable 
source show carlos salinas de gortari with 474 percent of the 45 
million votes counted so far cuauhtemoc cardenas of the leftist 
national democratic front was second with 267 percent and manuel 
j clouthier of the conservative national action party third with 
207 percent 
the 45 million votes counted are out of 117 million ballots 
reported so far to the commission mexico has 38 million registered 
voters but no figures are available how many voted in wednesdays 
election 
in addition to the presidency 64 senate seats and 500 in the 
newly expanded chamber of deputies are at stake 
a final vote count is not expected until sunday the early leak 
appeared designed to counter growing speculation that the ruling 
party known as the pri for its initials in spanish had suffered a 
devastating loss 
jorge de la vega dominguez chairman of the pri proclaimed a 
party victory in at least 27 of mexicos 31 states and said 
opposition accusations of fraud were meant to confuse the 
electorate 
the pri is going to defend its legal and unobjectionable 
electoral triumph with all the means of the law it is going to 
mobilize the force of all its organizations to combat the 
provocation and irresponsibility of the opposition he said 
a relaxed and smiling salinas meeting friday night with foreign 
reporters insisted that he was more concerned that the vote count 
be credible than with his margin of victory 
those results reflect real votes he said the results so 
far ratify this circumstance of plurality and a new political 
reality in mexico 
he said opposition parties will be most visible in the chamber 
of deputies where presumably would have a role in approving or 
blocking constitutional changes that require a twothirds majority 
at a news conference earlier friday clouthier accused the 
government of delaying an announcement in order to falsify results 
they are waiting to see how to disguise the figures he said 
i believe we won but i dont want to boast prematurely as my 
adversary has he said of the victory claim by salinas de 
gortari mexico has changed totally changed we will never 
have only one party again 
clouthier said he and cardenas met earlier in the day and agreed 
to share their information on voting results in order to challenge 
government figures 
he said they also agreed not to release figures publicly for the 
time being because when the government finds out what information 
the opposition has then officials will know which results they can 
dress up 
no pri presidential candidate since the partys founding in 1929 
has won less than 70 percent of the vote 
the slow count also is making evident splits within the pri 
between the 40yearold salinas de gortari and the oldstyle 
politicians 
the federal electoral commission which controls the vote count 
is headed by interior secretary manuel bartlett who was among 
salinas de gortaris chief rivals for the presidential nomination 
salinas de gortari has insisted throughout the campaign that he 
will introduce a new era in which opposition voices will be heard 
cardenas a former pri governor in the central state of 
michoacan until his break with the pri last year waged an 
unusually strong campaign that capitalized on widespread discontent 
with the hardships caused by six years of economic crisis 
the leftist candidate is the son of the revered late president 
lazaro cardenas in renouncing his own presidential hopes and 
endorsing cardenas last spring heberto castillo of the rival 
mexican socialist party described the cardenas movement as a 
phenomenon 
salinas de gortari appeared ready to concede losses to cardenas 
in michoacan the central state of morelos and in the federal 
district the core of the sprawling mexico city metropolitan area 
a fourth cardenas victory could come in the populous state of 
mexico which abuts the federal district on three sides 
the vote count made available to the associated press also 
showed gumersino magana negrete of the conservative mexican 
democratic party with 095 percent of the vote and rosario ibarra 
de piedra of the radical revolutionary workers party with 04 
percent 
most districts recorded so far are urban where cardenas and 
clouthier are strongest the salinas de gortari percentage could be 
expected to rise slightly with reports from rural district where 
the pri is traditionally strong 
bartlett said soon after the election that technical 
difficulties with a new computer system delayed the returns he 
later blamed bad weather 
the government says the elections were peaceful and clean pri 
officials have said charges by opposition parties that the 
balloting was fraudulent were a publicity move 
the assembly for effective suffrage a civic watchdog group 
recorded 1100 cases of voting irregularities ranging from 
ballotstuffing to tampering with voter registration rolls

theyll walk the plank in their next series with the new york mets

delighted to learn that pittsburgh has been designated one of 
americas mostlivable cities but the designation obviously 
was made koch said by someone with a sense of humor 
i cant promise your buccaneers the pirates will be walking 
on a red carpet when they arrive in the big apple for their next 
series with the mets but we will be looking for an appropriate 
plank koch said

starting july 29 the mets visit three rivers stadium aug 5 for a 
fourgame meeting 
kochs office released his letter friday as well as a letter 
sent june 30 by masloff to koch 
masloff wrote while i felt your comment on pittsburghs 
location was tongue in cheek pittsburgh having been designated 
americas mostlivable city and being the thirdlargest corporate 
headquarters in the nation just to be on the safe side i am 
sending you a map of pittsburgh 
it would be nice if you could make use of it when the mets and 
pirates tangle here again she added

the aegis air defense system used by the 
cruiser vincennes last week to track and shoot down an iranian 
passenger jet may not have been adequately tested before it was 
deployed according to a classified review by a congressional 
watchdog agency 
the general accounting office study concluded that the 1 
billion system has not proven its ability to discriminate among 
targets said congressional sources who have seen the document 
they spoke friday on condition they not be named 
the gao review started last year and did not mention last weeks 
destruction of iran air flight 655 that killed all 290 people 
aboard the vincennes fired at the airliner after mistaking it for 
an iranian f14 
pentagon officials have said the aegis system was not 
malfunctioning a minor degradation of the aegis radar was 
repaired before the ship entered the persian gulf last month they 
said 
aegis named for the shield of zeus in greek mythology is a 
complex mix of radars and computers it was developed as the main 
component of protection for navy surface ships against enemy ships 
and planes 
the navy is building a fleet of aegis cruisers of which the 
vincennes is the third the service is also using some components 
of the aegis system aboard other surface ships the system was 
first deployed in 1983 
the gao review looked at the aegis testing program before the 
system went into service said the sources 
the study criticized a series of 1984 tests in which the aegis 
system tracked 11 targets and guided the firing of weapons which 
hit 10 the sources said at one point two targets were fired upon 
at the same time 
the 1984 test program was set up specifically to answer 
complaints from aegis critics who argued that the system needed 
more realistic tests but the tests were set up so carefully they 
did not approximate a reallife combat environment the sources 
quoted the gao report as saying 
in other developments friday 
president reagan said the issue of whether to pay compensation 
for the families of those killed is under consideration white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater said there were still some open 
questions on the issue 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said the united states should adopt a new stance in the 
iraniraq war equidistant from the two warring countries i 
do believe that wed be much better served in trying to end the war 
if we were really in a position of condemning both attacks by iran 
and by iraq and also condemning the chemical warfare being 
conducted against innocent people by iraq he said 
pentagon officials said they are awaiting results of an 
investigation to learn why the vincennes missed air traffic 
communications and other clues indicating that the jet was a 
civilian plane and not an f14 fighter as officers aboard the ship 
believed 
iranian officials have said us systems should have been able 
to monitor 21 minutes of conversation in english between the 
jetliner and the airport control tower in bandar abbas 
but pentagon spokesmen said they were not sure us forces were 
monitoring or were able to monitor air traffic control 
communications at the time of the incident 
we are looking forward to an analysis of the tapes to help 
clarify the issue said lt cmdr chris baumann a pentagon 
spokesman

a judges order giving oliver l north broader 
access to secret government documents for his defense strongly 
raises the possibility he wont be tried on the main charges of the 
irancontra indictment 
but the order issued friday by us district judge gerhard a 
gesell clears the way for the fired white house aide to go to trial 
at least on charges he lied to cover up his activities and 
personally gained from his involvement in the irancontra affair 
the judges order scheduling the trial for sept 20 set the 
stage for the proceeding to take place in the middle of the fall 
presidential campaign 
in addition to fixing the trial date gesell ruled that north is 
entitled to use highly classified documents that might show the 
covert activities that are the basis of the irancontra conspiracy 
charge were authorized by the reagan administration 
the judge noted that some highly sensitive portions of documents 
in the prosecutions case that government security experts want 
deleted tended to exonerate north of guilt on certain charges 
gesell ruled north was entitled to cite these passages in a 
public trial if the government continues to object those charges 
could be dismissed under the classified information procedures act 
known as cipa 
the judge further ordered that independent counsel lawrence e 
walsh and the government must provide north with such highly secret 
documents as references in president reagans daily intelligence 
briefings to covert aid to the contras 
the fired national security council aide is charged along with 
former national security adviser john m poindexter and arms 
dealers albert hakim and retired air force maj gen richard v 
secord with conspiring to defraud the government by illegally 
diverting usiran armssale profits to the nicaraguan rebels 
all four defendants ordered by gesell to be tried separately 
are also charged with theft of government property and wire fraud 
walsh contends that the defendants corrupted the legitimate 
fully authorized presidential initiative of trading us arms for 
american hostages by funneling weaponssale proceeds to the contras 
according to court pleadings by walsh some of the documents 
sought are so sensitive that only the president and a handful of 
top officials have access to them 
gesell said he was not endorsing norths defense or even the 
admissibility of the documents as evidence but he said the 
material should be made available to the retired marine lieutenant 
colonel to assure that the truth whatever it ultimately proves 
to be will out 
the judge gave north until aug 1 to notify the government of 
his intention to use classified portions of the documents he 
already has as evidence he set an aug 15 deadline for north to 
file a similar list of material turned over as a result of fridays 
order 
a jury trial on those counts remaining after the cipa process 
takes it course is set for sept 20 gesell said 
it presently appears that at a minimum substantive charges 
of coverup falsification and norths alleged receipt of personal 
benefit derived from his conduct as a government employee can 
proceed to trial gesell said 
in a brief statement walsh said we are ready to proceed as 
directed by the court 
even if the three major counts are dismissed north is charged 
with 12 other felony counts including allegations that he 
lied to congress in 1985 about covert administration aid to 
the contras 
shredded documents during attorney general edwin meese iiis 
november 1986 investigation of the irancontra affair 
created phony documents to obstruct an fbi investigation into 
the construction of a 15000 security fence around his home 
accepted the fence as an illegal gratuity from secord 
pocketed 4300 worth of travelers checks from 90000 given 
to him by a contra leader to defray expenses for helping the rebel 
cause

the legal services corp is defending its 
chairman against congressional allegations that he improperly used 
government funds for presidential politics personal business and 
to help destroy the agency 
the corporation in a prepared statement issued late friday 
said it has uncovered no evidence that would lend credence to 
insinuations of misappropriation by w clark durant iii 
rep bruce a morrison dconn outlined the allegations and 
called for the resignation of durant who has served as chairman of 
the agencys board since december 1984 and was an adviser to rep 
jack kemps failed presidential campaign 
hes been undermining the legal services corporation by 
personal and political activities at the expense of the 
taxpayers morrison charged 
rep robert w kastenmeier dwis chairman of the house 
judiciary subcommittee on courts civil liberties and the 
administration of justice agreed that the evidence appears to show 
significant improprieties in the financial management of the 
corporation 
its very unlikely that durant could explain these matters 
satisfactorily he said 
durant reached by telephone at his detroit law office denied 
the allegations and countered that the congressional attack was 
motivated by political and policy disagreements over the direction 
of the agency which funds legal assistance programs for the poor 
the corporation said that it discovered during its examination 
of the records that mr durant is entitled to approximately 
8800 in attendance fees which he has not claimed the agency 
said it was continuing to review records at the subcommittees 
request 
the agency said the congressional investigation is being used 
by some in an attempt to derail needed reforms in the delivery of 
governmentfunded legal services to the poor and to discredit the 
efforts of chairman durant 
morrison said a preliminary congressional investigation of 
corporation records covering an 18month period revealed that 
durant used legal services telephone credit cards to call kemp 
headquarters nine times and may have charged campaigntied trips to 
the agency morrison said there were 23 trips to washington charged 
to the agency that have no documentation tying them to legal 
services work 
durant also charged to the agency longdistance phone calls to 
highranking federal transportation officials an apparent link to 
his private sector post as a railroad trustee morrison alleged 
and the congressman said durant is the man behind the 
agencys controversial move to hire lobbyists who were instructed 
to urge lawmakers to cut the legal services budget the general 
accounting office said last month that federal law prohibits such 
lobbying 
morrison added that documents provided by durant at the 
subcommittees request showed dozens of calls to private 
conservative organizations that have advocated the abolition of 
legal services including the heritage foundation dismantling 
legal services was an early goal of president reagan who appointed 
durant and the chairman has been a leading critic of his own 
agency 
morrison who headed a legal services program in new haven 
conn before his election to congress in 1982 estimated the cost 
of questionable telephone calls at more than 5000 plus 
thousands more in air travel 
durant scoffed at the allegations this is purely rooted in 
policy and political differences he said 
i dont have anything to hide he said if there are 
any calls that are not strictly related to legal services i have 
no objection and think the corporation should be reimbursed 
but he said those would not come close to the dollar estimates 
provided by morrison 
durant said he knew of 235 in telephone calls that were 
mistakenly charged to the agency and he said he knew of no travel 
expenses 
the decision to hire the lobbyists was made by john h bayly 
jr then president of legal services durant said but the 
congressmen said durant was behind the move to hire the lobbyists 
and then orchestrated a move to force bayly out of his job

the episcopal churchs policy making bodies 
friday approved a resolution to let the presiding bishop name a man 
to perform some sacramental acts for members who object to having a 
female bishop 
approval of the measure was in doubt briefly friday after a 
minor amendment was tacked onto it by the house of delegates one 
of two bodies meeting at the churchs 69th general convention here 
through monday but the house of bishops the churchs other 
legislative body concurred later friday 
while some at the meeting saw the resolution as watering down a 
1976 decision approving the ordination of women it sets a sixyear 
time limit on the authority to name a visitor as the man would 
be called 
the resolution was approved 12294 in the house of delegates and 
14028 in the house of bishops 
there are no women yet serving as bishops in the episcopal 
church but about 900 female priests have been ordained 
im sorry that the statement was accepted im glad there is a 
time limit i can live with it said the rev terry meadows a 
female priest from southern ohio 
patricia house a lay member of the house of deputies from san 
diego said the time limit undermines the episcopate in the long 
run i feel that a woman bishop would hasten the day of 
understanding 
the rev robert carey of the east oregon diocese backed the 
proposal and its limit 
i think the death of a belief is as painful as the death of a 
relationship he said there is a belief system dying we need 
to be concerned during grieving process and reach out as often as 
we can 
also on friday 
the house of bishops approved a resolution in response to a 
call by anglican archbishop desmond tutu to boycott american 
companies doing business in south africa the resolution goes to 
the house of delegates 
the house of bishops unanimously approved an economic 
development package that passed the house of deputies on wednesday 
and calls for 250000 from the church over the next three years to 
create community land trust cooperative housing employeeowned 
businesses and community credit unions

dudley moore says his sensitivity to alcohol 
abuse tempered his portrayal of the lovable lush arthur in the 
sequel arthur 2 on the rocks 
moore who won an oscar nomination for his performance as the 
drunken millionaire arthur bach said his approach to the character 
this time was different because of a heightened awareness of 
alcoholism 
there was no official pressure from the studio or from any 
organized groups moore said recently but i personally have an 
educated awareness of the problem 
the producers also avoided any scenes in arthur 2 on the 
rocks of arthur drinking and driving unlike the original in 
which arthur is seen cruising in his rolls royce swigging from a 
bottle 
theres a scene in which linda liza minnelli says she never 
lets him drink and drive moore said and you can tell that 
arthur knows exactly what he should or should not do he still gets 
very drunk but thats because he feels panicked and isolated 
sometimes and unable to cope with the world 
but moore is quick to point out that the film doesnt preach 
the sequel opened friday at theaters nationwide

sixtyfour men survived the piper 
alpha oil rig fire by leaping into the burning sea in the dark but 
they had to leave behind more than 100 colleagues trapped and 
screaming for air in the inferno 
i am one of the lucky ones harry calder said in an 
interview friday i am pretty sore i am badly bruised and my 
hands are burned but at least im alive i have lost a lot of 
friends 
seventeen bodies have been found and 166 men are presumed dead 
in the north sea oil field where the rig exploded wednesday night 
at least 100 men died screaming for help trapped in their 
sleeping quarters after surviving the first explosion said calder 
a 35yearold helicopter landing officer 
the workers were in the smokefilled galley of the platform 
which was plunged into darkness when the emergency lighting failed 
he said in an interview friday 
windows and the emergency door were cracking under the intense 
heat there must have been at least 100 men in there calder 
said men were shouting into their radios we need breathing 
apparatus whats happening is there anybody getting out we are 
all going to die 
it was sheer panic a lot of guys were lying on the floor 
just trying to breathe we had towels and we were just dipping them 
in anything to help us breathe he said 
calder and a coworker got out through a rear door just in time 
he said but i dont think the others made it i would have 
perished with them if i hadnt got out when i did 
he said he was asleep when the first explosion ripped through 
the rig but he and his colleague had climbed on to the roof of the 
helicopter deck by the time the second blast hit they made their 
way to the pipe deck and lay under a steel table for protection 
we were hardly getting any breath it was really bad he 
said then all of a sudden the floor collapsed and we found 
ourselves lying at an angle we saw a clear view looking through 
the smoke we said rather than burn we can get through that and 
jump 
we crawled along pipes which were scalding hot i burned my 
hands he said we got to the edge of the platform and just 
jumped it was well over 100 feet to the sea i missed the flames 
in the water 
i didnt have a life jacket calder said i hit the water 
and came up and i was ok i started swimming and kept swimming 
the two men got clear and calder said he held onto his 
coworkers life jacket then a life jacket appeared on the water 
in front of me and i put it on it was a stroke of luck 
there was debris everywhere and a lot of guys were sitting on 
pieces of debris the waves were coming over my head 
then i saw a supply boat it was easily a mile away i kept 
swimming and swimming and waving and shouting i wasnt sure 
whether i had been seen 
i was sure the skipper had given me a flash with his lights 
but the boat seemed to be going away calder said i thought 
that was going to be it that i was going to die 
then the boat went into reverse and turned round it came to 
me and threw me a lifeline they pulled me aboard my friend was 
picked up by another vessel i was told later that he was ok 
another survivor 50yearold james mcdonald said that when he 
and some others tried to leave the crews quarters the flames 
were shooting into the doors for about threequarters of an 
hour we were sitting inside nobody seemed to know what to do 
fire spread rapidly turning metal girders redhot and bringing 
decks crashing down in halfmolten heaps 
the men faced a hard choice stay aboard and hope aid got to 
them before the flames or jump into a sea that was cold enough 
below the burning oil to kill them even on a clear summer night 
the water temperature was 57 degrees 
burning oil was spreading across the few bare patches of water 
remaining and the decision had to be made quickly 
i decided to get myself out mcdonald said i wasnt going 
to sit down and get burned to death you either stayed where 
you were and burned to death or you tried to get out

president and military leader augusto 
pinochet said a plebiscite to choose the president for 198997 will 
take place within the next 90 days he is expected to be the only 
candidate 
pinochet also said friday he already has a platform for his next 
presidential term but he refused to disclose it because the 
opposition would copy it 
the plebiscite is near there are less than 90 days left 
pinochet told an audience of 16000 supporters in this southern 
port city 330 miles from santiago 
the 72yearold army commander has ruled this south american 
nation since a 1973 coup his remark was the most precise 
indication so far of a date for the ballot 
according to the 1980 militarydrafted constitution the 
nations next presiddnt will be picked in a plebiscite in which 
chileans will only be able to vote yes or no on a single candidate 
nominated by the heads of the three armed services and the national 
police 
pinochet himself will participate in the nomination as 
commanderinchief of the army and is considered the most likely 
nominee he is allowed by the constitution to seek reelection and 
has clearly indicated he intends to do so 
if voters approve the nominee he will serve for eight years 
starting in march 1989 if rejected pinochet will remain in power 
until 1990 and an open election would take place 
pinochet blasted opposition leaders seeking support from the 
international community as traitors 
he said some critics who recently were given limited access to 
television are going too far in their broadscast remarks 
when those bad chileans make insults on television because 
they know we are in a democracy and we wont do anything to them 
lets tell them that our patience has limits and that they could 
soon discover those limits pinochet warned 
he predicted an overwhelming victory in the upcoming plebiscite 
and said of his opponents we will wipe them out

falling water levels on the mississippi river 
that have stranded barges are threatening to trigger a regional 
water fight on capitol hill pitting southern senators and others 
against great lakes lawmakers 
on friday sen james sasser dtenn asked president reagan 
for an emergency diversion of water from the great lakes 
sasser and 12 other senators urged reagan in a letter to direct 
the us army corps of engineers to increase the flow of great 
lakes water to the illinois waterway and the lower mississippi from 
3000 to 10000 cubic feet per second for 100 days 
the action triggered immediate opposition from several midwest 
lawmakers led by sen howard metzenbaum dohio who said it would 
be illegal unless approved by all the great lakes governors 
and in canada justice minister ray hnatyshyn told parliament 
that canadas ambassador in washington allan gotlieb would 
deliver a formal notice to the state department saying that canada 
is unalterably opposed to any diversion 
hnatyshyn said canada can veto any diversion proposal as a 
result of several treaties we control our resources he said 
we will continue to control our resources 
sasser said the drought has pushed water levels on the 
mississippi three feet lower than they have been since 1872 when 
officials first began keeping records as many as 3000 barges are 
stranded with the loss to the barge and towing industry possibly 
exceeding 60 million he said 
communities along the river face the prospects of drinking 
water shortages and drinking water pollution because of the 
drought said sasser 
he said the diversion would raise the level of the river by one 
foot in st louis and six inches in memphis and only lower the 
level of lake michigan and lake huron by one inch 
metzenbaum said the great lakes states are hurting as well he 
said great lakes water levels have fallen two feet in the past 18 
months and are likely to continue to fall 
metzenbaum also said any action to divert the water would be 
illegal because the 1986 water resources development act bars 
diversion unless it is approved by all of the great lakes governors 
also the supreme court has set a limit on how much water can be 
diverted without its permission 
sasser said he believes the president has the authority to take 
the action as commander in chief in a national emergency 
sen carl levin dmich said corps officials he has talked to 
do not believe they have the legal authority to take the action or 
that it would do much good he said they believe that reducing the 
loads of barges would be more effective 
lake levels have dropped by 30 inches in the past two years 
said sen donald riegle dmich 
added sen william proxmire dwis diversion of water from 
the great lakes into the mississippi may damage navigation 
hydroelectric generation and the environment 
signing the letter to reagan urging the diversion were sasser 
and sens albert gore dtenn dale bumpers dark david pryor 
dark mitch mcconnell rky paul simon dill john stennis 
dmiss bennett johnston dla john breaux dla wendell ford 
dky alan dixon dill john danforth rmo and christopher

others joining metzenbaum in speaking against the action were

the leaders of 13 caribbean nations 
have accused the us justice department of interfering in their 
regions affairs as it cracks down on drugs and urged president 
reagan to halt the meddling 
members of caricom the caribbean community and common market 
ended five days of talks friday without agreeing on haitis coup 
but they agreed to work toward eliminating obstacles to regional 
trade by oct 1 
the leaders drafted a letter to president reagan saying that the 
us justice department was overstepping its jurisdiction by 
investigating alleged drug traffickers in panama and the caribbean 
the contents of the letter were not revealed but antigua deputy 
prime minister lester bird said it would be signed by the caricom 
secretary general to represent all the leaders 
bird announced it would protest what the leaders considered a 
derogation of their local laws and us violations of their 
sovereignty as the reagan administration seeks to win favor in an 
election year 
some of the leaders criticized bird for making the announcement 
prematurely prime minister james mitchell of st vincent and the 
grenadines said it was bad manners 
others stressed their traditionally close ties with the united 
states and said it had not intervened directly in their affairs 
bird reading from a communique drafted by the leaders said 
they also reaffirmed their total commitment to the fight against 
all illegal trafficking in drugs 
they expressed their willingness to ccoperate with other 
countries for the establishment of internationally acceptable 
mechanisms to bring offenders to justice he said 
the caribbean has long been a source and an important conduit 
for drugs coming into the united states cocaine from south america 
traditionaly passes through caribbean ports before entering the 
united states much marijuana is also grown in the area 
from the start of the meeting monday it was apparent the 
leaders were unlikely to reach unanimous agreement as required by 
caricom rules on what position to take on the haitian military 
government that ousted president leslie manigat in a coup june 19 
they debated options ranging from revoking haitis status as an 
observer on four caricom standing committees to simply issuing a 
strong statement denouncing the coup 
the leaders were more successful when talking about 
intraregional trade 
the leaders agreed to remove all trade obstacles such as stamp 
duties and import licenses by oct 1 and to study a request by the 
smaller countries to protect 23 items they consider too fragile to 
compete with imports 
trade and industry ministers will meet before the oct 1 
deadline to decide which items should be excluded and for how long 
caricom established in 1973 to promote regional trade and set 
common positions on international events includes antiguabarbuda 
bahamas barbados belize dominica grenada guyana jamaica 
montserrat st kittsnevis st lucia st vincent and the

court papers have revealed for the first time 
that federal agents are looking at whether one of the navys former 
top officials accepted bribes while he helped direct president 
reagans defense buildup 
a search warrant used by the fbi in the june 14 search of 
defense consultant melvyn r paisleys home in nearby mclean va 
said agents sought details about payment from general dynamics 
and mcdonnell douglas to paisley in the form of checks gifts or 
other forms of remuneration or to his wife vicki at the time he 
was an assistant navy secretary 
another entry states agents wanted information about payments 
or gratuities from pratt amp whitney employees to paisley before he 
left the navy in march 1987 pratt amp whitney is a division of 
united technologies corp 
as an assistant navy secretary between 1981 and 1987 paisley 
63 played a key role in guiding the enhancement of the navy under 
thennavy secretary john lehman jr a former executive at the 
boeing co paisley left government to become a consultant 
paisley has surfaced as a key figure in the investigation into 
allegations that defense contractors and consultants many of them 
former military men bribed pentagon officials for contracting 
details that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of 
dollars to date no one has been charged in the case 
the washington post reported today that the unnamed informer 
referred to in an early government affidavit who helped 
investigators launch the probe is a retired marine corps major who 
is now serving a prison sentence for child molestation 
the post quoting unnamed sources said consultant john p 
marlowe offered inside information on marine contracts to a defense 
firm and later agreed to cooperate with government investigators 
and secretly tape his conversations with other consultants 
marlowe 45 is serving a sixyear sentence at a virginia state 
prison for his 1985 conviction on charges of indecent exposure and 
aggravated sexual battery in cases involving two girls aged nine 
and 10 the post reported 
paisleys house was one of as many as 40 premises across the 
nation searched on june 14 the day the fbi revealed the existence 
of the investigation of alleged massive corruption in the 150 
billionayear defense department purchasing system 
the search warrant which was released by a magistrates clerk 
in us district court in alexandria va said the fbi also sought 
evidence that paisley gave james e gaines a deputy assistant 
secretary of the navy a western painting titled lonesome 
whistle 
they also sought evidence that paisley or fellow consultant 
william galvin provided gratuities to gaines including money to 
gaines companies entertainment tickets and tires 
the fbi documents showed the government is investigating 
paisleys work as a consultant to 10 defense contractors and 
disclosed the names of several pentagon employees or former 
pentagon employees whose contacts with paisley are being 
investigated 
the warrant sought any document establishing an employee or 
contractual relationship between paisley and these 10 companies 
mcdonnell douglas corp martin marietta bdm ems pocal ball 
aerospace united technologies corp norden unisys and whittaker 
agents are looking at paisleys efforts to obtain government 
contracts for them from 1981 through 1988 
among the people mentioned specifically in the warrant was a 
person identified as rumpf 
richard r rumpf the principal deputy assistant secretary of 
the navy for research engineering and systems was paisleys 
deputy in the pentagon his wife lenore works for the navy air 
systems command 
rumpf did not return a telephone call to his office friday 
also mentioned was ann berman a former deputy assistant 
secretary of the navy who now works for united technologies berman 
said she would have no comment 
paisley has not commented on the probe but his attorney e 
lawrence barcella has criticized leaks of information about the 
probe and has dismissed the allegations as garbage 
of interest to investigators is paisleys involvement both in 
the pentagon and as a consultant in the advanced tactical 
aircraft one of the navys biggest procurement programs 
mcdonnell douglas and general dynamics are partners in the 4 
billion program awarded last year to build the new aircraft 
in another instance the government searched for evidence that 
paisley supported pratt amp whitney for the jvx project and v22 
engine and payments or gratuities from pratt and whitney 
employees to paisley during his tenure as assistant secretary of 
the navy 
paisleys involvement with foreign concerns also was targeted in 
the search warrant investigators sought information about 
paisleys involvement with the mazlat co an israeli company 
in 1986 the navy awarded a 26 million contract to consortium 
comprised of mazlat and the american aai corporation to build three 
remotely piloted vehicles known as drones 
the fbi sought several items dealing with mcdonnell douglas the 
st louisbased defense contractor the company supplies american 
forces with helicopters and fighter planes and is involved in 
efforts to sell advanced fighter aircraft to several nations 
an fbi list of items seized by agents at the paisleys home 
included tax returns bank account numbers paisleys security 
badge from general dynamics and a confidential 12 pg memo re 
visit to china 
pentagon spokesman fred s hoffman said the defense department 
had no reaction to the revelations we have it in hand and are 
studying it he said 
al spivak a spokesman for general dynamics said the company 
knows of no payment of bribes by this company or any of its 
people to paisley or his wife while paisley was in the navy or in 
private life james linse a spokesman for pratt amp whitney said he 
could not comment because he had not seen the warrant

the us missile cruiser that shot down 
an iranian passenger jet it mistook for a fighter plane was out of 
action last month because its radar malfunctioned us officials 
said 
but a navy spokesman said the breakdown on the uss vincennes in 
june was only a minor degradation and had no bearing on 
sundays disaster that left 290 dead in the persian gulf 
us officials say the billiondollar warships hightech radar 
system received signals from the iran air airbus a300 identifying 
it as an iranian f14 fighter coming in for an attack iran said 
all 290 people aboard were killed 
the breakdown was reported on june 13 by the associated press 
although gulfbased us navy officials refused then to confirm 
that the problem lay in the computerized system called aegis 
the aegis system of computerlinked radar and weapons is 
designed primarily for defending a naval fleet in the open ocean 
from air and missile attack the navy says it can detect identify 
and head off a threat developing hundreds of miles away 
the 9600ton vincennes arrived in the gulf may 27 the first of 
the navys aegis cruisers to be assigned to the us naval force in 
the waterway 
it was assigned to patrol in the southern gulf but by about 
june 10 it was anchored off bahrain where navy sources said it was 
undergoing repair work on the radar system that lies at the core of 
its capabilities 
a navy spokesman in the gulf asked about the reported breakdown 
at that time said only that the ship was in port for maintenance 
upkeep the result of an unspecified problem 
officials here refused comment friday but a navy spokesman at 
the pentagon lt brian cullin confirmed the vincennes had been 
down with a minor degradation of its radar system he said 
there was no connection between that and the shooting down of the 
iranian jetliner 
the problem had absolutely no bearing on the whole incident 
he said in a telephone interview it the cruiser was never less 
than 100 percent up on any mission capability including 
antiaircraft warfare 
he said he could not confirm that the ship was out of action for 
16 days as reported by the los angeles times 
cullin said the problem had actually been detected during the 
vincennes 32day voyage from san diego to the arabian sea where 
it arrived may 22 
a necessary replacement part was flown to the ship and installed 
by the ships own crew he said and the ship was back up on line 
by june 6 
he said he did not know why the ship was then off the line 
again spending at least three days around june 1013 at anchor 
outside bahrain before it returned to its duty station in the 
southern gulf 
some of the vincennes crew said they were puzzled why the ship 
had been ordered to make a rush departure from san diego after only 
90 hours of port preparation and on arrival spent five days in the 
gulf of oman sailing in circles as one officer described it 
before entering the strait of hormuz 
many navy ships especially those with sophisticated electronics 
and other equipment have civlian experts known as tech reps 
aboard to maintain and repair the gear most are employees of the 
manufacturers 
there were no such representatives aboard the vincennes its 
officers told journalists who rode the ship into the gulf that the 
crew was fully capable of maintaining and repairing the ships 
complicated systems 
the vincennes was riding at anchor off bahrain for a third day 
friday but two other warships that contributed data to the 
investigation of the jetliner incident the frigate elmer 
montgomery and the missile frigate john h sides returned to duty 
in the gulf 
both had been nearby when the aircraft was shot down the 
disaster followed a clash involving the vincennes the elmer 
montgomery and some iranian speedboats two of which were sunk 
us officials said 
computer tapes from the warships are being sent back to the 
united states for analysis at the navys surface warfare center in 
dahlgren va us sources said they could offer no indication of 
when a team of six military investigators sent here to investigate 
the incident would complete their task and return to the united 
states 
the team headed by rear adm william m fogarty arrived here 
on tuesday with orders to deliver a report in 15 days if possible

presidential palace that a new constitution will be written soon 
he said the one approved by a massive voter turnout in march 1987 
was unhappily written and ratified in a climate of passion and 
emotion 
it is obviously illusory to think of the full enjoyment of 
rights and liberties in the context of absolute poverty in which 
nearly 70 percent of the population in the country is vegetating 
namphy said 
the future depends on what we do or refuse to do now he 
said adding that the new constitution will take haitian reality 
into account 
namphy pledged his government would respect freedom of speech 
and assembly and the right to participate in labor unions and 
political parties 
portauprince remained calm late friday night as it was after 
the june 19 coup that sent president leslie manigat into exile 
namphy said the current constitution the most liberal in 
haitis 184year history and ardently defended by civic and 
political groups introduced foreign elements to haitian 
traditions 
the constitution approved by 99 percent of haitians who voted 
in a march 29 1987 referendum prohibited close duvalier 
collaborators from running for public office for a period of 10 
years it also provided for an independent electoral council to 
organize national elections 
during the 20minute speech namphy was flanked by manigats 
cabinet ministers and top aides to former dictators jeanclaude 
duvalier and his father francois duvalier 
after jeanclaude duvalier fled into exile in 1986 namphy ruled 
until manigats inauguration last february a period tainted by 
army killings of peasants demonstrators and opposition leaders 
on nov 29 1987 duvalierists shot and hacked to death at least 
34 voters while soldiers looked on and in some cases escorted the 
gunmen the same day namphy dissolved the independent electoral 
council then handpicked another council which ran the 
fraudriddled january vote resulting in manigats election 
namphy spoke in the same hall of busts where manigat had held 
his three monthly news conferences the entire high command of the 
haitian military was present including col jeanclaude paul 
indicted earlier this year by a federal grand jury in miami on 
charges on drug smuggling 
sitting in the front row among the invited guests were three 
former presidential candidates francois latortue gerard 
phillipeauguste manigats minister of agriculture and gregoire 
eugene now namphys adviser on constitutional law 
also present were two duvalier supporters who had been rejected 
as presidential candidates by the former independent electoral 
council claude raymond and clovis desinor 
asked if he thought the new constitution would promote democracy 
in haiti philippeauguste responded democracy is one thing a 
constitution is another all depends on whether the law 
written or unwritten is obeyed 
eugene insisted that civil liberties would be respected under 
the new constitution he said he opposed the constitutional 
provision banning duvalier suporters from running for office 
i think it is better to let the people decide for themselves 
whether they want to vote for former duvalierists he said

he survived vietnam a dangerous tour as an 
undercover decoy cop and two bouts with cancer that cost him his 
legs now bruce neberieza is fighting to keep a desk job that 
officials contend he can no longer handle 
they say that because i use two canes i cant defend 
myself the 43yearold neberieza said friday 
since his first amputation in 1980 neberieza has been assigned 
to the front desk of a local precinct the police department has 
tried since last summer to strip away that job either by 
suspending him or putting him on medical disability claiming he is 
medically unfit for the post 
the city told neberieza on tuesday it was suspending him without 
pay or insurance until the city police board rules on whether he 
should be put on disability pension 
what has been filed with the police board are specifications 
stating that based on evaluations he is not able to fully perform 
the functions of a police officer said robert karmgard the 
citys assistant corporation counsel 
but circuit judge thomas rakowski ruled thursday that neberieza 
is entitled to a police board hearing before the board rules and 
extended an order he first issued in october that bars the city 
from taking neberieza off the payroll without such a hearing 
it makes no sense for a person who has performed his duties 
is performing his duties has a doctors affidavit that he can do a 
desk job to be denied salary and medical insurance without a 
hearing the judge said 
the police board hearing is scheduled for july 15 
neberieza who supports his wife and three children on his 
35000 salary said he wants to stay on active duty another 15 
years to qualify for full pension on disability he would receive 
half pay for four years and a small annuity thereafter 
i cant afford to settle for a small annuity he said i 
have a mortgage and bills like anyone else 
i feel i fit the definition of a policeman ive done 
everything theyve asked me to do 
he has proved he can do the job said john dineen president 
of chicagos fraternal order of police he has been doing it for 
seven years 
neberieza joined the police force 15 years ago after a vietnam 
tour with the air force 
he eventually was assigned to an undercover unit of decoys who 
prowled subways acting like drunks or sleeping commuters to lure 
muggers 
but in 1980 his right leg was removed at the hip because of 
cancer 
that meant a limitedduty job he was assigned to a neighborhood 
police stations front desk 
five years later he developed heart trouble and had quadruple 
bypass surgery 
it wasnt until last year when neberieza lost his left leg 
below the knee to cancer that the city decided it no longer could 
use him 
the two requirements to remain on the job are that they must 
be able to ambulate independently and be able to fire a firearm if 
he cant protect himself how could he protect the citizen 
police commander hubert holton the departments personnel 
commander told the chicago tribune 
neberieza who walks on two artificial legs said he is no more 
disabled than any number of other handicapped officers performing 
limitedduty jobs 
his attorney anne burke said the department has 600 light 
duty jobs and neberieza easily could fill one of them except for 
his court appearance she said he hasnt missed a day of work

soviet premier nikolai ryzhkov 
says the red army will withdraw from foreign lands by the end of 
the century but a us official says a soviet pullout may be 
imminent in hungary 
a state department official said friday that there are 
increasing indications of a unilateral withdrawal from hungary 
which was invaded by soviet troops in 1956 to crush an uprising 
reports of a possible soviet withdrawal have circulated for a 
year and a half the state department official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said its information is based on us 
intelligence reports 
ryzhkov speaking to western reporters friday gave no 
indication that the soviet union was preparing a unilateral 
withdrawal from an east bloc nation before 2000 
the soviet government chief told western reporters such moves 
could come only in the context of a general withdrawal involving 
western forces as well 
he said his government feels no armies should be on foreign 
territory us british or soviet 
our proposal is this let us take out all the armies he 
said the armies in czechoslovakia are part of the warsaw pact 
armies let us agree on a radical solution in the west and in the 
east 
red army units are stationed in several soviet bloc countries 
including czechoslovakia hungary and east germany 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley cautioned that after 
announcing troop withdrawals form east germany in 1983 the soviets 
built their forces in that country back to the same levels within 
three years 
currently four soviet tank and motorized rifle divisions remain 
in hungary the troops are not on the front lines opposite nato 
forces however because hungary is bordered to the west by three 
warsaw pact nations and politically neutral yugoslavia and austria 
even with a withdrawal said oakley the warsaw pact would hold 
a 21 advantage over the north atlantic treaty organization in 
tanks artillery and armored personnel vehicles 
in talks with reporters ryzkhov also seemed to dash hopes for 
any rehabilitation soon of alexander dubcek the former communist 
party leader in czechoslovakia who is famed for his liberal 
policies 
ryzhkov confirmed that at the recent communist party conference 
kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev stressed the need for 
socialism with a human face 
that phrase was used to describe dubceks prague spring of 
1968 which provoked a sovietled warsaw pact invasion in august of 
that year and cost dubcek his job as party chief in prague 
western reporters asked ryzhkov who attended a threeday 
economic conference that ended thursday whether the time had not 
come for dubcek to be rehabilitated 
he replied the rehabilitation of dubcek that is a question 
for czechoslovakia i do not intend to deal with the internal 
problems of czechoslovakia as far as i know the czechoslovak party 
does not intend to deal with that 
dubcek now 66 said in an austrian television interview 
broadcast thursday that the current leadership in prague should 
adopt gorbachevs reforms most are similar to reforms dubcek 
introduced here 20 years ago

torrential rains swelled rivers and 
sparked flooding that crushed homes and capsized boats marooning 
millions of people and killing up to 115 authorities said 
the water development board warned that the flooding that has 
plagued the country for the past week could worsen in the next two 
days 
the board said in a statement issued friday that all rivers in 
the brahmaputra basin were rising from the rain and the onrush of 
waters from northeastern indian states 
the army was called out friday to assist with rescue opertions 
press reports said as many as 5 million people were marooned in 
northeastern districts 
the number of marooned people is so huge you cannot bring all 
of them to safer places said an official in the town of 
sunamganj who spoke on condition of anonymity 
sunamganj is 112 miles northeast of the capital at dhaka 
vice president nurul islam flew to the sunamganj area by 
helicopter friday to assess flood damage the aircraft was unable 
to land because no suitable dry ground could be found an aide said 
today on condition of anonymity 
twentyfour more deaths occurred friday according to local 
government officials and newspaper reports raising the unofficial 
death toll to at least 115 
the government confirmed 10 new deaths and said its official 
count stood at 60 
the new nation an independent englishlanguage daily and 
ittefaq a bengalilanguage daily blamed the deaths on houses 
collapsing and boats capsizing 
most of the deaths were reported in the northeast which has 
been hardest hit by the floods 
bangladesh one of the poorest nations in the world with a 
population of more than 105 million often suffers flooding during 
the annual monsoon rain season 
its lowlying land is vulnerable because not enough dams have 
been constructed on major rivers to control water flow 
press reports said rescue efforts were hampered by relentless 
rain 
thousands of people were trapped on rooftops or high ground 
without food press reports said the ittefaq newspaper said there 
were reports of outbreaks of diarrhea and other waterborne 
diseases because of a shortage of pure drinking water 
the northeastern teagrowing district of sylhet was all but cut 
off from the rest of the country friday when the main highway 
bridge washed away air service to the region was suspended earlier 
in the week when runways flooded 
in hobiganj just southwest of sylhet a tributary of the 
brahmaputra river was flowing more than 5 feet above flood level 
the highest in memory the water development board said 
in moulvibazar in the district just south of sylhet town 
leaders urged residents to leave for higher ground as the towns 
protective embankment threatened to cave in officials there said

the postal service will be restoring full 
window service that was cut at the nations post offices in 
february to save money 
postmaster general anthony frank said on friday that managers 
have found enough savings in other areas to reopen windows sept 
10 to the same level of service that existed prior to feb 13 
frank said local managers will have the discretion to decide 
what changes are best for their community for example in some 
areas evening hours may be expanded while in others an extra clerk 
may be put on at busy times instead of having longer hours with 
fewer clerks 
the cuts in window service one step to trim spending by 160 
million amounted to about half a day a week and in many areas 
that meant closing offices on saturdays 
other communities had their post offices closed one morning or 
one afternoon a week 
the changes drew considerable criticism particularly since they 
occurred just before an increase in postal rates 
frank has struggled in his four months in office to explain that 
the rate hike was initiated more than a year ago because of growing 
deficits while the service cuts were required when congress 
ordered a sudden reduction in postal spending 
in a related development later friday the postal service 
announced it was suspending all work on a controversial contract 
with texas computer billionaire h ross perot who was studying 
ways to improve the agencys efficiency 
under terms of the deal with perot the initial 500000 phase 
of the work was to be followed by a second phase in which payment 
would be based on a percentage of any savings realized by the 
postal service that apparently openended deal has generated 
controversy 
at least two competitors of perot complained to the general 
services administrations board of contract appeals which ordered 
the pact suspended the postal service however has argued that 
board has no jurisdiction over its activities 
the postal service said late friday it believed its contract 
with perot was a valuable and innovative approach to making 
operations more efficient but that it suspended the contract 
because of gsa boards order 
the dispute probably will have to be settled in federal court

the national assembly today passed two 
laws that could force former president chun doohwan to testify on 
charges of corruption that allegedly occurred during his sevenyear 
tenure 
government party officials said they would ask president roh 
taewoo to veto the laws approved by the oppositioncontrolled 
legislature the proposals were passed 164125 with three 
absentions 
if vetoed the bills likely would die because the opposition 
lacks the twothirds legislative majority needed to override a 
presidential veto south koreas three predominant opposition 
parties together control 166 seats in the 299member national 
assembly 
the governing democratic justice party criticized the proposals 
and said roh would certainly veto them party officials argued the 
bills are unconstitutional 
it is highly regrettable that the opposition rammed the law 
bills through the assembly in disregard of our repeated warnings 
that they would be vetoed democratic justice party floor leader 
kim yoonhwan said 
kim wonki floor leader for the party for peace and democracy 
the largest opposition group said he doubted roh would veto the 
bills 
i dont think president roh would veto the bills he has 
repeatedly promised that there would be no sanctuary in 
investigating past corruption and irregularities the opposition 
leader said 
the legislation contains a provision that empowers the national 
assembly to subpoena witnesses with writs of arraignment issued by 
courts of law 
opposition politicians said such a law is needed to compel all 
witnesses to testify in south koreas huge government corruption 
case 
they said privately that the main targets of the laws are chun 
and his family 
roh and other top government officials maintain that they would 
support efforts to ferret out all past corruption and 
irregularities under chun but the president oppose any moves to 
make the chun testify or stand trial 
chun whose term ended in february has come under public fire 
for alleged involvement in largescale financial scandals one of 
his brothers chun kyunghwan was arrested in march for embezzling 
millions of dollars 
several parliamentary committees were organized this week to 
look into alleged corruption and other problems under chun 
one committee is charged with probing a 1980 antigovernment 
uprising in the southern city of kwangju that left nearly 200 dead 
and more than 800 others injured according to official count 
opposition and dissident groups allege that chun along with roh 
and the united states helped mastermind the brutal suppression of 
the uprising

astronaut charles bolden says his 
two rides in an escape basket down a slideforlife wire should 
give other astronauts and workers confidence that the space shuttle 
launch pad emergency system is safe 
bolden made the first trip alone friday then was joined by two 
safety workers for the second zip down the wire from the 195foot 
level of shuttle launch pad 39b a platform at that level provides 
access to the crew cabin of space shuttle discovery 
it was not a thrill ride it was a very gentle ride it looks 
worse than it is bolden told reporters 
it was the first time humans had ridden the basket since it was 
installed several years ago for the shuttle program astronauts and 
launch pad personnel would use the system in case of a fire fuel 
or gas leak or other emergency on the pad that gave them time to 
reach the baskets 
the baskets dropping at 50 mph are halted abruptly at the 
bottom of the wire by a braking system backed up by a rope net 
there are seven baskets each designed to hold three people 
each trip friday took about 20 seconds with a quick run to an 
underground bunker at the bottom taking another 15 seconds 
until recently some nasa officials felt the swift ride would be 
risky and should be attempted only in an actual emergency earlier 
tests were run with sandbags substituting for humans 
but with the added emphasis on safety after the loss of the 
shuttle challenger and its seven crew members the space agency 
decided to test the basket system with humans after making several 
improvements 
bolden and the two safety workers volunteered for the job 
ive always had confidence in the system but i felt it was 
important to put someone in the basket to show people that it 
worked the way it is designed bolden said 
maybe people were hesitant about using it before but i think 
this test will give them confidence and they will have no qualms 
about getting in the baskets if they have to he added 
among the systems improvements were the addition of two 
baskets a side exit in each basket to ease exiting added 
flameprotective material and an antirollback brake to ensure the 
basket stops as quickly as possible 
discovery was moved to the launch pad on monday to prepare for 
the first shuttle launch since challenger exploded after takeoff on 
jan 28 1986 the launch is scheduled for early september

thailands foreign minister said today 
that an international peacekeeping force could prevent the khmer 
rouge from retaking power in cambodia after vietnamese occupation 
forces leave 
foreign minister siddhi savetsila said thailand and its 
southeast asian allies do not want to see a return of the khmer 
rouge who killed up to 3 million people when they ruled cambodia 
from 1975 until the vietnamese invasion of 1978 
previously officials of the association of southeast asian 
nations which strongly backs a threeparty resistance coalition 
that includes the khmer rouge did not issue a strong public stand 
on the issue 
siddhi spoke at a news conference ending a threeday annual 
conference of foreign ministers of asean 
i think the khmer rouge know that they cannot come back 
because we dont support them to come back he said so i think 
we can use a lot of pressure besides the peacekeeping force 
they know that asean is trying to support a resolution of 
the cambodian problem by not supporting the return of the khmer 
rouge he said 
at the same news conference secretary of state george shultz 
said that during his upcoming visit to china he plans to stress 
americas opposition to the khmer rouge china is the khmer rouges 
main source of arms 
the chinese attitude toward the khmer rouge and the nature of 
the continuing support to an overall cambodian settlement will be a 
very important factor and recent statements by china are 
encouraging in that regard shultz said 
also important to a political settlement shultz said is the 
soviet unions influence on vietnam he said the kremlin gives 
vietnam 2 billion in military aid a year 
the khmer rouge ruled cambodia from 1975 until the vietnamese 
invasion in december 1978 during that time they killed millions 
of cambodians the group is known for its radical agrarian 
communism 
shultz reiterated us support for a central role in any 
settlement for prince norodom sihanouk a former cambodian head of 
state who now leads the guerrilla coalition the third group in the 
resistance is led by son sann a westernleaning politician 
shultz said he hoped the cambodian peace talks planned for 
indonesia on july 25 would be successful the talks are to involve 
the guerrilla groups the vietnameseinstalled government in 
cambodia vietnam laos and the asean countries 
vietnam has said it will pull its estimated 140000 troops out 
of cambodia by 1990 and has begun withdrawing 50000 troops in an 
operation to be completed in december 
delegates said asean ministers did not discuss the khmer rouge 
issue during their conference on monday and tuesday bit it became 
a dominant topic when the western dialogue partners joined in 
consultations starting thursday 
asean groups thailand malaysia singapore indonesia the 
philippines and brunei its dialogue partners are the united 
states japan australia canada new zealand and the european

rescuers today called off their 
search for a cargo ship carrying 26 filipino seamen that had been 
missing for six days authorities said 
the singa sea lost radio contact on sunday during rough weather 
about 1200 nautical miles off the coast of western australian 
state said leone jorgensen spokeswoman for the coastal 
surveillance authority 
aircraft have found no sign of the vessel she said 
the planes have searched over a wide area but havent come up 
with anything jorgensen said we are now just in a 
waitandsee situation 
there is still hope that the singa sea might simply have 
veered off course to avoid storms and have suffered from radio 
failure she said 
the ship was carrying a load of mineral sand when it was in an 
area where 50knot winds were recorded

the ruling nationalist party indicated 
today that several but not all of the islands oldguard leaders 
are to retire 
ten of the 31 members of the nationalists policymaking central 
standing committee were named to the central advisory committee 
which is composed primarily of retired officials 
nationalist party spokesman raymond tai told reporters that 
advisory panel members will not sit on the new central standing 
committee to be named thursday at the end of the weeklong 13th 
party congress 
the average age of current central standing committee members is 
70 with seven members more than 80 years old more than half fled 
to taiwan with chiang kaishek from the chinese mainland when his 
nationalist government was routed by the communists in 1949 
leaders of the nationalist party also known as the kuomintang 
have stressed the importance of promoting younger party members who 
represent the taiwan public 
young party members have criticized oldguard conservatives from 
the mainland for not being enthusiastic about the liberalization 
policies initiated by president chiang chingkuo before his death 
in january 
chiang the eldest son of chiang kaishek lifted martial law 
allowed new political parties and eased a ban on travel to mainland 
china 
still to be changed is the parliamentary system in which 
mainland chinese nationalists hold a majority of seats to back the 
partys claim that it remains the rightful ruler of china 
president lee tenghui who was acclaimed the first native 
taiwanese party chairman friday has vowed to continue the process 
of democratic change and liberalization but has moved cautiously in 
past months as he has sought to consolidate power 
the new members of the advisory committee proposed by lee and 
approved by the congress include five of seven octagenarians on 
the central standing committee 
three media executives on the central standing committee who 
have said they want to give way to a younger leadership also were 
named to the advisory panel 
but premier yu kuohwa and shen changhuan secretary to the 
president were not named to the advisory group the two 
74yearolds are influential conservatives and liberals fear they 
could block reforms 
this will be a very conservative restructuring said 
political journalist antonio chiang but he added that the 
conservative oldguards power base was dwindling and younger 
members would likely be more willing to speak up 
the 1209 congress delegates will elect a 180member central 
committee on tuesday for the first time the vote will not be 
limited to candidates proposed by the party 
the new central committee will meet thursday to name the new 
central standing committee a cabinet overhaul is expected later

the drought has claimed yet another group of victims the 
migrant farm workers who find their labor is unneeded as the crops 
they normally pick shrivel in the dusty fields of the midwest 
we want to cry said norma nieto who recently traveled with 
14 others from her home in brownsville texas to wisconsin we 
need the money and we have come so far it will be sad to go back 
in worse shape than when we came 
ms nieto 21 said the group stopped in michigan first they 
found a little work there but no housing 
now ms nieto and her family and friends are stranded in 
wisconsin where officials estimate 4000 to 5000 migrant workers 
are victims of the nations worst drought since the 1930s 
ms nietos mother concepcion zamorano told a translator 
each year we leave our home wondering what is going to happen 
and hoping we will have a good year this year its been real 
bad

harvest route north from texas to work in beet fields of sandusky 
mich twelve of the 15 are zamorano family members 
roberto silva a migrant farm worker who arrived in hoopeston 
ill on june 25 with his family of 12 is in no better shape 
we were working in michigan and heard rumors there was a lot 
of work down here he said since there has been no rain there 
is no work in the fields yet said silva 40 of edinburg texas 
in hoopeston the illinois migrant council so far has registered 
about 70 mexicanamerican families nearly 300 people said 
council supervisor hada reed 
for the past 25 years silvas family has made the trek to 
michigan for farm work this year they found little so they headed 
to hoopeston an eastcentral illinois town of 6400 
but the parched summer stymied them 
there is very little sweet corn because of the drought and as 
far as im concerned there will be no lima bean or pumpkin 
harvest ms reed said 
most of the workers earn the minimum wage of 335 per hour 
what they make during seven months on the road must carry them to 
the next harvest season 
some have been here since june and have worked two or three 
days at the most theyre getting checks of 40 ms reed said 
many have been living in parks she added 
david granadas and his family his wife and their five 
children eight brothers his parents an uncle and a cousin have 
been renting a home in oxford ind about 40 miles to the east 
but i am worried because i have to pay the rent which is 
250 a month said granadas who has been looking for work since 
june 20 
wisconsins united migrant opportunity services a support 
agency for migrant workers appealed this week to gov tommy g 
thompson for emergency money for food shelter and transportation

exhausted in a month executive director lupe martinez said 
thompsons office said friday the request was being reviewed 
this time last year mrs zamorano her husband justo and two 
of their children worked at a cannery in belgium wis about 30 
miles north of milwaukee 
they had fulltime jobs on the assembly line and housing in the

which the group of 15 made the 1500mile threeday trip from 
brownsville 
but without the money for the return trip even giving up and

sister of pilot mohsen rezaians wife the child was born in 
oklahoma while mrs rezaian was visiting her sister

is she the mother going to tell her that her father was shot down 
by americans when shes an american mrs sadeghi said friday 
the rezaians had two other children 
mrs sagedhi and her husband kamran said the pilot considered 
the united states his second home 
he liked the united states very much mrs sadeghi said 
he had a good time here added kamran sadeghi who said 
rezaian was trained in texas by boeing co 
the sadeghis said because of the increased us presence in the 
persian gulf they knew their brotherinlaws job had become more 
dangerous 
even so said mrs sadeghi she considered his job routine she 
was a stewardess in iran from 1968 to 1973 im familiar with the 
flights they are all so crowded 
kamran sadeghi came to the united states in 1971 to attend the 
university of oklahoma and now works for the school as a computer 
programmer 
the couple said they arent sure who to blame for the incident 
sunday in which the uss vincennes shot down the airbus a300 which 
carried 290 people 
all iranians do not represent the iranian government mrs 
sadeghi said same with the americans and the american 
government they are following their own policies i blame the 
situation its the war that made the american navy to be there 
mrs sadeghi said her sister has been living in west germany for 
10 months because of the fighting between iran and iraq 
the sadeghis had a strong reaction to early reports that the 
downed flight was a suicide mission with orders to crash into 
the vincennes

possible he was a very good human being he valued people he 
valued peoples lives

his own life 
now mrs sadeghi said her concerns lie with her sister and 
how she can survive this with her children she said the 
children had not been told yet how their father died 
the couple said that if the united states offers to provide 
financial help the payment should go directly to the families 
if the united states pays them money i dont want them to pay 
the government of iran sadeghi said if they do they should 
pay the victims directly iran needs money without it maybe it 
would stop the war

the government has proposed 
the creation of regional legislative councils to address matters 
related solely to blacks antiapartheid activists condemned the 
proposal 
blacks would elect members to the regional councils under the 
proposed extension of political participation bill which was 
published friday in the official government gazette 
the bill did not specify how many councils would be established 
president pw botha would have the power to veto bills passed by 
the councils 
presently blacks can vote only in municipal elections and in 10 
homelands elected black officials are widely viewed in their 
communities as collaborators with the whiteled government 
south africas 26 million blacks have no representation in 
parliament and cannot vote in national elections its 5 million 
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts schools 
and health services 
the proposed councils would have authority over regional matters 
concerning blacks such as education welfare local government and 
community development 
it is the governments viewpoint that all communities should 
participate in the government process on the different levels 
said chris heunis minister of constitutional development and 
planning 
helen suzman member of parliament for the progressive federal 
party said the proposal was one of those hopeless efforts to 
avoid the realities of the south african situation 
the duplication of government structures to run this country 
has become totally absurd she said 
antiapartheid activists have rejected all the governments 
major political reform proposals in recent years saying they 
entrench white domination and continue to divide political 
participation by race 
the government is seeking comment on the latest proposal before 
deciding whether it will be introduced in parliament heunis said

the malaysian bar council today 
urged acting lord president justice abdul hamid omar the countrys 
highest ranking judge to resign and said it would begin contempt 
of court proceedings against him 
the unprecedented action by the bar council which represents 
2500 lawyers in malaysia was the latest move in a battle between 
prime minister mahathir mohamad and the judiciary the only branch 
of government still independent of his control 
the battle began may 26 when the government suspended the 
previous lord president mohamad salleh abas and accused him of 
lack of dignity judicial propriety and impartiality 
salleh had written to king sultan mahmood iskandar and 
complained that mahathir had been attacking the judiciary 
last saturday five supreme court judges ordered a tribunal 
hearing the charges against salleh not to advise the king on 
whether to remove salleh permanently until it received further 
orders 
on wednesday the king suspended the five judges and ordered 
them to face a tribunal that will decide whether they will be 
removed permanently 
he acted on a request from hamid who alleged that the five were 
guilty of misbehavior 
by his recent actions hamid omar has shown himself as 
unfit for judicial office the council said 
the malaysian bar calls for immediate revocation of the 
suspension of the five judges of the supreme court as the 
suspensions are totally inconsistent with the independence of the 
judiciary and will lead to the destruction of the judiciary as an 
independent branch of government the council said 
deputy prime minister abdul ghafar baba denied on friday that 
politicians were undermining the independence of the judiciary 
in february the high court ruled that mahathirs party the 
united malays national organization was illegal because it had 
branches that were not registered with the authorities as required 
by law since then mahathir has set up a new party called new 
umno and has been busy recruiting old members

toward busy la guardia airport on friday evening when the planes 
electrical power and radio went dead 
i thought we might get in trouble if we cant call the 
tower chris said later 
but the power outage lasted only about 10 seconds and he landed 
safely 
i thought it was neat to land at a big airport the oceano 
calif boy said 
chris who is accompanied by a former navy pilot hopped across 
the country from san diego to kerrville texas then to st louis 
and new york 
today if the planes electrical problems are sorted out he 
and his companion planned to head toward europe his flight plan 
calls for stops in montreal greenland and iceland 
i want to show all other kids across america that if i can do 
this trip they can do this trip chris said friday at lambert 
airport in st louis before taking off for new york 
chris the son of a commercial pilot first took the controls of 
a plane at age 4 and began flying with an instructor at 7

got around 270 hours of flying time in and hes very responsive

and partially paralyzed during world war ii says he will leave his 
plane behind as a historical marker 
clark harrison who is paralyzed from the chest down said 
friday he was abandoning the trip to stolberg west germany he 
made the emergency landing thursday after his singleengine

of the us air base at sondrestrom greenland 
the 63yearold decatur businessman suffered a cut and some 
bruises in the crash he said he would take a military flight to 
the united states and a commercial flight home tonight 
weve decided to leave it up there harrison said of his 
airplane during a telephone interview from the base its going 
to be a historical marker he added half in jest 
although the plane was not badly damaged col guy sumter 
commander of the supply base at sondrestrom said it may not be 
possible to remove the aircraft which is nose down in a ditch next 
to a pond

in greenland on business 
i felt god was answering harrison said of hearing his old 
friends voice epps notified the base that harrison was lost and 
almost out of fuel on epps advice harrison climbed to 7000 feet 
so the base could locate him on radar 
harrison said he got his bearings when the clouds cleared as he 
approached the coast of greenland and saw an island he recognized 
from his maps as being north of his plotted course as he turned 
south toward the air force base the plane ran out of fuel 
all i saw was mountains and rocks i looked down and i saw a 
little lake and it had a little green next to it and i said that 
looks better than anything else he said 
i was pretty sure i wasnt going to be in this life when i got 
on the ground harrison said i realized the plane had stopped 
and i was on the ground but i couldnt remember where i was and 
what i was doing there 
he was rescued a short time later 
we knew when he got to the coast by tracking him on radar 
and we knew where he should have been sumter said 
harrisons trip was planned as a fundraising project for the 
shepherd spinal center in atlanta and its center for independent 
living supporters pledged up to 1 for each mile covered by 
harrison a founding director of the 13yearold medical facility 
for spinalcordinjured patients

the government has drafted comprehensive rules 
for women workers barring them from hard physical labor and 
lengthening their maternity leaves a report said today 
the regulations also ban discrimination against women but only 
if the work is deemed suitable for women workers according to 
the official china daily 
it said the regulations stipulate the kind and intensity of work 
suitable to women and bar them from laborintensive jobs such as 
mining and leathermaking the criteria used in determining what 
jobs were suitable was not given 
the regulations were drafted by the ministries of labor and 
public health the allchina trade union and the allchina womens 
federation and have been approved in principle by the state 
council the top executive body the report said 
the rules guarantee women the right to refuse job assignments 
that could harm their health allow one year of maternity leave 
with 90 paid days up from the current 56 and guarantee rest 
periods for pregnant and menstruating women and those who have just 
had abortions 
the newspaper did not comment on the possibility that the 
regulations would discourage employers from hiring women who 
according to official reports already face greater difficulty than 
men in finding urban jobs 
in the countryside most women do farmwork although growing 
numbers of male peasants are leaving the land to work in small 
factories 
the traditional belief that women are inferior to men is still 
deeply ingrained in chinese society the guangming daily reported 
last year that dozens of women graduates of peoples university in 
beijing were rejected by the work units to which the state had 
assigned them some units said they did not employ women 
now that factory managers have been given the power to fire 
workers in recent years women have been dismissed in larger 
numbers than men official reports have said 
the china daily said the new regulations contain clear 
stipulations that all working units suitable for women workers 
should not reject female job applicants on any pretext 
it did not say what sanctions if any would be applied against 
employers found guilty of discrimination 
chinese law already bars women from working in mines but 
thousands are estimated to do so because mining often is the 
bestpaid work in rural areas 
despite the egalitarian ideology of mao tsetung and the 
equality still promised in the constitution women have always been 
treated as secondclass citizens in china 
during maos rule when government and party committees on 
various levels were handpicked one or two women would be put on 
them now there is limited choice in elections for such committees 
and women are getting voted out

the two men were indicted last week in the june 19 attack on the 
burlington family along with two other white men from burlington 
and a white woman from nearby woburn both towns are suburbs of 
boston 
this is considered a serious serious matter and is being 
prosecuted as a priority said tom samoluk a spokesman for the 
district attorneys office the da is making it clear that it 
will not be tolerated 
assistant district attorney george murphy said in court that 
waterhouse was the leader of the pack that battered down the 
door of sherwin moystons home entered yelling racial slurs and 
forced 32yearold moyston from the livingroom into the kitchen 
they came in yelling we want you nigger we want a piece of 
you nigger murphy told middlesex superior court judge hiller 
zobel 
moyston grabbed a knife in the kitchen and drove the attackers 
back out the front door where he was joined by a relative marvin 
mcnichols 
waterhouse struck mcnichols in the mouth knocking him 
unconscious and opening a wound that took 18 stitches to close 
murphy said 
the five attackers left the property after hurling cinder blocks 
at the house and breaking windows authorities said 
when they were leaving they said were going to take care 
of you niggers were going to come back murphy said 
the prosecutor had asked zobel to hold waterhouse on 500000 
double surety and blanchette on 200000 
during the hearing murphy said he requested a higher bail for 
waterhouse because of the suspects record of violent behavior and 
because waterhouse is currently the target of a grand jury probe 
into the stabbing death of a black man whose body was found in 
woburn last month he refused to elaborate after the hearing 
the codefendants barbara j lindsay and john c soda both 18 
and mark gilmartin 20 are scheduled to be arraigned july 15

oil troubleshooter red adair 
boarded the piper alpha oil platform today to try to stop fires 
still raging on the twisted wreckage where 166 people died in the 
worlds worst oilfield disaster 
adair was lowered by crane onto the north sea rig from the 
nearby support vessel tharos in a personnel basket said occidental 
petroleum the rigs american owner 
occidental petroleum hired the 73yearold texan to make the 
platform safe seal gas leaks and determine whether he can save the 
oil wells to which the rig is connected adair of houston texas 
has gained fame for capping outofcontrol oil wells 
occidental says it believes a gas leak caused an explosion last 
wednesday night that turned the 34000ton rig into a fireball 
sixtyfour workers escaped and survived eighteen remained in 
aberdeen royal infirmary one in serious condition and the rest 
stable the hospital said today 
adair and two assistants flew to the disaster site 120 miles 
off scotlands east coast on friday they have been using the 
tharos a semisubmersible support vessel that adair helped design 
as a temporary base 
on friday prime minister margaret thatcher and occidental 
petroleum chairman armand hammer agreed that the explosion shows 
major design changes are needed on offshore oil platforms 
hammer mrs thatcher prince charles and princess diana met 
some of the survivors and families of the dead on friday the royal 
couple brought skin graft equipment from london to treat survivors 
burns 
hammer said occidental was donating 17 million to a trust fund 
for the injured and the bereaved the government matched the figure 
and the european economic community added 952000 
the 90yearold oil magnate told a news conference after meeting 
with mrs thatcher in this east scottish port city friday night 
mrs thatcher thinks and we think that when we complete our 
inquiry and the government completes theirs it may very well be 
that the living quarters for the men may have to be removed from 
the precarious position they are in 
survivor harry calder 35 said 100 men died screaming for help 
trapped in the living quarters after they survived the initial 
explosion 
the quarters were directly above the rigs gas compression 
chamber where occidental officials say they think a gas leak 
caused the blast 
hammer said living quarters and production facilities probably 
would remain on the same platform but would be separated instead 
of adjacent as at present 
in a statement released in london occidental confirmed british 
news reports that the rigs gas compression chamber had previous 
problems including a gas leak and a fire 
but it said the problems were minor they were corrected and 
they had no bearing on wednesdays disaster 
charles heir to the throne and his wife princess diana were 
driven to the emergency entrance of the aberdeen royal infirmary 
and spoke briefly with doctors before going to visit the injured 
charles brought with him skin graft equipment for the 
infirmarys burn unit to replace a machine that was not working 
properly 
it was much needed said oliver fenton a plastic surgeon 
we were having to shuttle the only one working effectively round 
the operating theaters 
flags flew at halfstaff in aberdeen capital of britains north 
sea oil industry when mrs thatcher arrived at the aberdeen royal 
infirmary 
im amazed at how well they are in themselves she said 
even though they have burns and internal burns their morale is 
very high these are people with great inner strength and great 
capacity to tackle the disaster 
hammer said the six occidental employees who survived and the 
families of 31 who died would receive compensation worth about 
170000 each plus lifetime pensions and occidental will fix 
compensation later for the employees of 25 contractors 
about 120 workers on british petroleums west sole gas platform 
in the north sea resigned friday saying they were concerned about 
safety they said access from the living quarters to evacuation 
positions on one platform was difficult 
but british petroleum said in a statement we are regularly 
inspected and have to meet the regulations if we did not come up 
to standard we would not be able to continue producing

libraries are considered mines of 
information but a student digging for knowledge got more than she 
expected when she uncovered 12 uncut diamonds tucked inside an 
86yearold diary 
gerda ray a doctoral student at the university of california at 
berkeley was doing research work at yale universitys sterling 
memorial library last month when she found the gems wrapped in old 
cigarette papers inside a letter the letter was tucked into a 1902 
diary of author katherine mayo 
though there have been lots of discoveries here they have 
always been intellectual ones said mary lafogg an archivist at 
the library 
researchers have used the mayo collection for almost 30 years 
said lafogg but no one noticed the diamonds before 
i cant think of anything quite as exciting lafogg said 
adding that there has never been a similar discovery at the library 
peabody museum mineralogist eleanor faller said the diamonds are 
not valuable but they match stones found during the early 1900s in 
british guiana now guyana in south america 
the stones were sent to mayo who died in 1940 by a friend 
living in british guiana 
the diamonds will be housed in the peabody museum

an opposition candidate in mexicos 
presidential elections said today the governing institutional 
revolutionary party was seeking to steal victory with its demand 
for a recount of votes in the capital 
national democratic front candidate cuauhtemoc cardenas told a 
news conference that the governing party had petitioned the federal 
elections commission to nullify voting in the federal district 
because thousands of voters had used differing party symbols to 
cast ballots for cardenas 
cardenas is listed on the ballots as the presidential candidate 
of three different parties those parties subsequently merged as 
the national democratic front to back his candidacy 
the commission had rejected a democratic front request before 
the election that ballots be reprinted to list cardenas only once 
the governing partys recount request is absurd cardenas 
said our information shows we have won in nearly all if not 
all 40 districts of the federal district 
i call upon the president of the republic and governing 
party candidate carlos salinas de gortari to comply with their 
word and their commitment to preserve the legality of this 
electoral process he said 
early and partial returns released by the federal electoral 
commission on friday showed salinas with 474 percent of the 45 
million votes tabulated the commission said cardenas had 267 
percent of the vote and manuel j clouthier of the conservative 
national action party had 207 percent 
final results for the presidential election and for the 64seat 
senate and 500seat congress are to be released sunday 
the governing party has won every presidential election since it 
was created in 1929 but this years presidential and congressional 
balloting was expected to be the closest in years 
the commission did not say how many of mexicos 38 million 
registered voters actually cast ballots on wednesday 
the governing partys chairman jorge de la vega dominguez 
earlier had proclaimed victory in at least 27 of mexicos 31 states 
and said opposition accusations of fraud were meant to confuse the 
electorate 
porfirio munoz ledo a front senate candidate and former 
chairman of the institutional revolutionary party charged that the 
governing party was printing extra ballots to replace those it was 
seeking to annul the new ballots would be marked with 
institutional revolutionary party votes he said 
just friday morning everyone in the government knew we had 
won the mexico city race munoz ledo said now they are 
delegitimizing everything 
munoz ledo also indicated the front was leading in the states of 
michoacan mexico morelos and guerrero 
on friday salinas appeared to be preparing supporters for the 
partys first federal losses since it was founded in 1929 
the results so far ratify this circumstance of plurality 
and a new political reality in mexico salinas said 
cardenas said today the election commission had promised not to 
release any returns until the vote count was completed and charged 
the figures included results from voting stations where the 
institutional revolutionary party said it won 100 percent of the 
votes or did not permit opposition pollwatchers to be present 
the interior secretary broke the commitments he gave not to 
publish incomplete results and released these data without 
consulting the various parties cardenas said 
institutional revolutionary party officials speaking on 
condition of anonymity had said friday the governing party may 
have to concede that cardenas won in michoacan morelos and the 
capital they said cardenas might also win in the state of mexico 
which abuts the federal district on three sides 
salinas said the oppositions presence will be most felt in the 
chamber of deputies where a twothirds majority is necessary to 
pass legislation the chamber traditionally has been little more 
than a rubber stamp for the institutional revolutionary party 
there were going to see intensely this new reality salinas 
said 
earlier friday clouthier accused the government of delaying an 
election announcement to see how to disguise the figures he 
called a rally for today in mexico citys central square where his 
party planned to release its own vote count 
hundreds of national action party supporters celebrated friday 
in ciudad juarez to mark what they believed was a victory there a 
party motorcade crisscrossed the city in triumph but all was quiet 
at the citys institutional revolutionary party offices 
the assembly for effective suffrage a watchdog group said it 
discovered 1100 cases of irregularities ranging from 
ballotstuffing and tampering with voter registration rolls 
alfonso bravo president of justice and peace one of the 
organizations comprising the assembly said the group had detected 
voting irregularities in 20 percent of the approximately 28000 
voting booths it had monitored

divers retrieved 13 more bodies today 
from a train that derailed on a bridge and tumbled into a lake 
raising the death toll to 103 government and navy officials said 
the divers used gas torches to cut open a last passenger car 
that could not be searched immediately after the accident on 
friday there had been fears that as many as 50 passengers were 
trapped in the car when it plunged into the water 
but vice admiral laxminarayan ramdas chief of the southern 
naval command said he believed most victims had been found 
we have searched the entire lot he said after returning 
from the accident scene it is most unlikely that we will find 
any more bodies though there may be odd ones stuck somewhere 
however teams of navy divers kept looking for bodies in the 
20to 30foot water as far as 400 yards from the sunken wreckage 
railway minister madhav rao scindia today ordered a formal 
inquiry into the derailment 
he told a news conference after visiting the crash site that 
families of victims would be compensated the united news of india 
reported 
nine cars of the 14car island express derailed friday on a 
bridge over lake asthamudi near the town of quilon in kerala state 
about 1200 miles south of new delhi 
abdul latif additional district magistrate in quilon said most 
victims died of drowning 
at least 167 people remained hospitalized today he said 
officials had said after the train wrecked that 500 people were 
injured but most of the injured were treated for minor injuries 
and released 
efforts to recover the bodies continued into the night under 
floodlights but had to be called off at 10 pm because of rain 
and poor visibility the search resumed this morning 
six of the brickred cars were partly or fully submerged in the 
water and three hung from the bridge which is about 15 feet above 
the lake the engine and the following luggage car crossed the 
bridge safely and the last four cars did not go off the trestle 
fishermen in long narrow boats were the first to reach the 
scene and the rescue official said they saved more than 200 people 
from drowning

cochin 70 miles northwest of the accident site continued the 
rescue effort 
the railway administration still does not know how many people 
were aboard the train bound from bangalore in neighboring karnataka 
state to trivandrum the capital of kerala and about 30 miles south 
of quilon 
government television and indian news agencies reported that a 
cavein on the 540foot bridge caused the derailment but railways 
ministry officials said the cause had yet to be determined 
matthew john a railway safety official said two spans of the 
bridge were damaged but that investigators believe this happened as 
the train cars plunged into the water 
witnesses told indian news agencies that the train engineer 
jammed on the brakes just before the derailment but subramaniam 
said it wouldnt cause a disaster of this magnitude 
the indian railway system second largest in the world and

a un official today called for a 
sept 1 ceasefire in afghanistan and establishment of an interim 
afghan government that would exclude guerrillas or officials under 
marxist president najib 
un envoy diego cordovez making his comments a a news 
conference after returning from the afghan capital of kabul said 
the proposed government would consist of recognized independent 
and impartial afghans 
cordovez said the new government would be effective sept 1 
when a ceasefire would go into effect and that it would convene a 
grand council of leaders no later than march 1 
the grand council is a traditional afghan decisionmaking body 
whose leaders were chosen according to the countrys tribal 
structure 
cordovez said he believes such a council would be able to 
establish a government with broadbased support while najibs 
national reconciliation plan and attempts by supporters of the 
guerrillas to generate mass support have failed 
the guerrillas did not immediately comment on cordovez peace 
plan but a spokesman for a moderate guerrilla group opposed any 
negotiations with the communist afghan government 
we will not have anything to do with communists any kind of 
communists said azim nasserzia of the national islamic front 
of afghanistan 
he also called for a coolingoff period in the fighting 
before sept 1 during which the interim government would be 
chosen afghan guerrilla leaders backed by china pakistan and the 
united states have insisted that they will continue to fight until 
soviet troops are out of afghanistan and the kabul government is 
toppled 
i doubt whether there could be a coolingoff period said 
ikram gran spokesman for the sevenparty afghan alliance which 
has its headquarters in pakistans northwestern city of peshawar 
gran said however that he and nasserzia both supported the 
selection of the independent and impartial representatives 
they suggested the new leaders could be chosen among former cabinet 
ministers and officials now living in exile 
cordovez returned to islamabad friday from kabul where he met 
with najib other afghan leaders and soviet gen valentin verenikov 
cordovez negotiated the april 14 geneva accords which provide 
for the phased withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan 
the kremlin sent troops and tanks into afghanistan in december 
1979 to back the communist government in the april pact the 
soviets agreed to pull out the more than 100000 troops they 
deployed 
half of the troops are to be out of the country by aug 15 and 
the remainder by feb 15 
cordovez said 32000 soviet troops have already left 
afghanistan he said soviet military representatives assured him 
the withdrawal was proceeding as planned

faced with its toughest opposition in years 
the machine that runs mexico is torn between adapting to a changing 
political climate or clinging to a formula that has kept it in 
power for six decades 
the institutional revolutionary party has been beset by 
infighting between oldguard operatives who want to keep the system 
intact and a new breed led by presidential candidate carlos salinas 
de gortari who want to modernize the party machine 
the political system now is made up of a huge network of 
patronage and porkbarrel projects that can create or eliminate 
jobs and which provide a raft of favors to loyal party members 
corruption has been a key ingredient in its succes 
under the system the outgoing president usually names his 
successor subject to approval by the party other candidates are 
chosen in closed conventions and the party machinery makes sure 
they get elected 
the system has kept the party in power under various names since 
it was formed in 1929 its presidential candidate always has won 
with at least 70 percent of the vote 
it has held the governors offices in all of mexicos 31 states 
and lost only one senate race to a coalition that included the 
party in the chamber of deputies it has tolerated a weak 
opposition 
opponents or opposition groups who became to powerful often were 
bought off with plush jobs or gradually swallowed by the 
institutional revolutionary party 
for years it worked slowly like an amoeba assimilating and 
incorporating opposition groups one old pri hand who spoke on 
condition he not be identified said recently 
as long as mexico remained even relatively prosperous it could 
finance the partys system and the party kept mexico politically 
stable and generally content 
the bubble burst in 1982 when prices of oil mexicos 
principal export plunged bringing on one of the severest 
economic crises in half a century 
jobs suddenly were not plentiful real income plunged by at 
least 40 percent 
one of the engineers of the austerity program was salinas di 
gortari 40 a harvardeducated economist who served for five years 
as president miguel de la madrids budget and planning secretary 
the crisis also brought widespread discontent and this 
strengthened the parties both on the right and the left of the 
governing party the tensions between the old guard and the 
technocrats became more visible after salinas nomination for 
president last year 
de la madrid a harvard educated technocrat himself ignored 
objections from powerful groups and selected salinas as his 
successor 
many favored interior secretary manuel bartlett and others 
backed thenenergy and mines secretary alfredo del mazo 
fidel velazquez 88 general secretary of the partys power 
mexican labor federation and a member of the old guard made no 
bones of his displeasure when salinas de gortari was proclaimed by 
the party as its presidential candidate 
preliminary election figures from the federal electoral 
commission show the party won the presidency by its slimmest margin 
yet 
early returns indicate salinas de gortari won an estimated 474 
percent while cuauhtemoc cardenas of the leftist national 
democratic front had 267 percent and manuel j clouthier of the 
conservative national action party had 207 percent 
even before wednesdays elections salinas said in his speeches 
the party should be modernized to meet the growing challenge of the 
opposition 
the lefts apparent success in the elections was spurred by 
cardenas who broke with the governing party last year after his 
push for reforms was rebuffed 
salinas aides now speak of a multiparty system for mexico 
in which the institutional revolutionary party would occupy an 
expandable center 
salinas campaigned for democratic reforms less state 
intervention in the economy and the need for clean elections 
aides said throughout the campaign that he was prepared to 
sacrifice ideology to practicality in a bid not just to get to los 
pinos the presidential residence but to get there with some of 
his partys credibility intact 
the major question for him in his first months of office will be 
how much resistance the old guard puts up to his proposed 
changes

officials today reopened beaches along the south 
shore of long island that were closed for as many as three days 
after needles blood vials and other debris washed up on shore 
federal and state investigators said friday that the debris that 
had closed 25 miles of beaches did not appear to be hospital wastes 
as originally thought but instead looked like household and 
boating garbage 
jones beach robert moses state park and beaches on fire island 
were reopened today to weekend beachgoers 
city health commissioner dr stephen c joseph said friday that 
the waste that washed up on a sevenmile beach in the citys 
borough of queens causing officials to close it friday did appear 
to be medical in origin but stern said today that the debris 
seemed to be of local origin or syringes used by drug addicts 
joseph and new york city parks commissioner henry j stern said 
the evening tide friday and the morning tide today brought nothing 
new and the beach was reopened 
ron foley the long island regional director for state parks 
said officials searched jones beach which was reopened friday 
afternoon and robert moses beach this morning and found no other 
waste 
foley said he believed the problem with the waste washing ashore 
is over 
debris that collected since wednesday on the long island beaches 
included fewer than three dozen syringes of the type used for 
insulin injections three blood vials vials associated with the 
drug crack and some plastic tubing of an uncertain source said 
james marshall a spokesman for the federal environmental 
protection agency 
we dont believe this is the result of illegally dumped 
hospital waste said randy braun an epa worker who examined the 
ocean water from a helicopter 
ice cream sticks were mistaken for tonguedepressors a 
carpenters mask was thought to be a surgical mask and a pair of 
household rubber gloves used by a lifeguard to pick up wastes from 
the beach were taken for surgical gloves said august v sellitto 
an assistant to us attorney andrew j maloney of brooklyn 
borough who has been investigating the episode 
eight miles of long island beaches in the town of bablyon were 
closed friday for the first time in addition long islands tobay 
beach and six small beaches on fire island were closed for the 
second day 
in long islands nassau county health department tests of the 
ocean water indicated it was in good to excellent condition with 
minimal risks for bathers additional tests are planned for the 
weekend the department said 
the garbage recovered from the beaches will be turned over to 
the us attorneys office to determine whether it can be traced 
and whether criminal charges are appropriate said us rep thomas 
downey dny 
twice in the last month vials of blood that washed up on the 
nearby new jersey shore were found to contain traces of the aids 
virus the source of the vials has not been traced

firefighters dug with picks and shovels 
today to finish the last three miles of fire line around a 
16500acre forest fire near mount rushmore that stopped growing 
after thundershowers dampened the area 
were looking at 90 percent containment this morning said 
dennis neill fire information officer we got some good work 
done last night 
todays forecast was for warmer drier weather he said but on 
friday thundershowers lifted the spirits of the estimated 1200 
people fighting the fire south of mount rushmore national memorial 
about 100 of the men and women concentrated on finishing the fire 
line today 
with the combination of the lower temperature lower wind 
speeds higher relative humidity and the rain id say we got a 
significant amount of help on the fire fire information officer 
jerry hagen said 
lightning is believed to have started the fire monday night in 
custer state park it spread wednesday into the black hills 
national forest and briefly threatened mount rushmore and the town 
of keystone 
twentyseven miles of fire line were complete this morning 
neill said smoke from the fire was no longer visible in custer 
about four miles away 
hagen said one drawback to the thunderstorms was lightning that 
could cause new fires but he added if we get some moisture 
along with the lightning i think well be hitting it pretty good 
thirty families living along french creek road outside the west 
boundary of the park were allowed to return home at their own risk 
today but the area remained closed to the public 
residents were ordered to evacuate friday after flames jumped a 
highway on the southwest edge of the fire officials said the 
flames had burned within 1 miles of some of the homes 
custer state park remained closed to the public with police 
stationed at the entrances 
crews for black hills power amp light co returned to the park

pentagon spokesman dan howard admits he is no 
expert on the high technology of the iranian airliner crisis but 
after more than 15 years in the state department and at the white 
house neither is he any stranger to dealing with reporters in 
times of trouble 
for nearly 2 hours during the past week howard fielded 
questions in the cramped pentagon briefing room about such things 
as transponders air corridors black boxes and the differences 
between mode 2 and mode 3 electronic signals 
he had been a state department public affairs officer dealing 
with the philippines when president ferdinand marcos was forced 
from office 
he had been spokesman for the us embassy in cyprus when shiite 
gunmen seized a twa airliner and killed navy diver robert stethem 
he had been expelled from poland for his contacts with polish 
intellectuals after the warsaw government declared martial law in 
1981 
he had been a standin spokesman at the white house at the 
height of the irancontra crisis 
but nothing in his career had been quite like this 
its a very different environment from the white house he 
said in an interview everybody has an opinion and a point of 
view and the place is so big there are so many points of view 
there are so many kinds of experts and not all those experts 
agree and so we have the battle of the experts in the briefing 
room some of the time 
the longtime news people here are the ones that on some 
issues its very difficult to deal with because you end up 
getting a counterbriefing from the floor 
in the giveandtake howard sometimes simply has told reporters 
that their questions go beyond his technical knowledge saying for 
example i am not the final authority on widths of air 
corridors 
i am simply trying to explain the matter the best i can with 
the information available to me he said thursday 
television newspaper and magazine reporters covering the 
pentagon generally agree that he has done a good job although to 
some he seemed a bit impatient at times 
he gets testy over some things as most any briefing officer 
does but by and large he tries to be helpful said carl 
rochelle pentagon correspondent for cable news network he tries 
to answer your questions if he cant answer them he tries to make 
it clear to you that he cant answer them and sometimes he even 
tries to help when he cant answer 
bruce van voorst national security correspondent for time 
magazine said im amazed that dan dares to stand up in front of 
that crowd out there which is for the most part a pretty 
professional operation and talk about mode 2 or mode 3 operations 
and that sort of stuff he has obviously made every effort to at 
least become reasonably familiar with the technical issues he was 
talking about 
david evans pentagon correspondent of the chicago tribune 
said i was very pleased on tuesday that he took an hour to have 
i think a viable exchange with the assembled reporters 
the twiceweekly pentagon briefings usually last about half an 
hour tuesdays was roughly an hour and thursdays was more than 80 
minutes almost entirely devoted to the shooting down of an iranian 
airbus by the us cruiser vincennes on sunday 
this is not the kind of a story that any spokesman likes to 
deal with of course but all you can do is the best you can 
said howard 
the spokesman 45 from chattanooga tenn is married and has 
three children the oldest a boy studying astronomy at boston 
university his wife mary a real estate agent watched him brief 
on thursday for the first time 
although he may not know everything about transponders howard 
does have some technological expertise he can call upon he is an 
old car buff and likes to fix them up himself 
the airliner incident and the current investigation of defense 
department procurement are the biggest stories he has had to handle 
since he came to the pentagon in february as assistant secretary of 
defense for public affairs from his previous post as a deputy white 
house press secretary 
the week after the procurement story broke in midjune howard 
had planned to go on vacation he hasnt had the vacation yet

the heat wave in much of the country is 
pushing up concentrations of ozone a major air pollutant over big 
cities to levels sometimes not seen for a decade 
we are having an absolutely horrendous summer commented 
bill becker executive director of the state and territorial air 
pollution program administrators association on friday 
ozone prompted air pollution advisories in chicago every day 
last week and caused standards to be violated in vermont for the 
first time in recent memory 
several states and cities warned people with lung problems to 
curtail activities and stay inside during the afternoon new york 
had a statewide advisory on friday 
the new peaks come at a time when the environmental protection 
agency is considering whether new ozone standards are needed 
because of unexpected lung damage under certain conditions 
they also coincide with warnings from some scientists that the 
longpredicted greenhouse effect warming of the earth has 
begun and hot dry ozoneprone summers are going to become more 
frequent 
james hansen a climatologist at the national aeronautics and 
space administration says hot summers with hot defined as 
the warmest onethird of all summers in 19511980 could occur 
half the time in the mid1990s 
heat speeds up ozone formation temperature inversions may trap 
ozone near the ground and keep it from dispersing 
though in the stratosphere ozone protects the earth from harmful 
ultraviolet rays of the sun at ground level epa has defined it as 
unhealthy in concentrations over 012 parts per million for an 
hour ozone constricts the air passages in the lung it is the 
chemical than makes your chest feel tight in smog 
three things make ozone sunlight oxides of nitrogen from 
burning fossil fuels and compounds like those found in unburned 
gasoline vapor which react with the nitrogen oxides 
concentrations peak in the afternoon and decline at night 
the chief weapon for fighting ozone is reduction of gasoline 
vapors through controls on cars some areas require auto 
inspections and vapor recovery at service stations 
the junking of older dirtier cars has brought cleaner air to 
many cities but epa lists 68 cities and rural areas as violating 
ozone standards 
the latest research part of a wave of new findings that started 
about two years ago could mean an additional standard covering a 
longer period like six or eight hours said bruce jordan head of 
the standards section in epas air program that could take 18 
months to develop he said 
most ozone research has concentrated on peak exposure but new 
work shows that several hours of exposure at elevated levels means 
it takes less exercise to bring on restricted breathing weve 
seen an effect at 008 ppm for 66 hours said jordan our real 
concern is multiple hits of peaks and valleys of exposure you 
seem to get more damage than with a constant exposure 
animal studies show that lung damage from high concentrations 
tends to persist something the agency hopes to confirm or rule out 
through human autopsy studies 
some reports from the field 
at bennington in the southwest corner of vermont a monitor 
recorded ozone concentrations of 0125 ppm on two days in june 
im not prepared to say what the origin is but the majority has 
to be interstate transport said brian fitzgerald of the state 
natural resources agency 
in other words pollutants emitted in massachusetts 
connecticut new york and other upwind points early in the day were 
still forming ozone after having been blown into vermont 
he said no one could remember the last violation but he 
believed it was three or four years ago 
washington dc as of friday had seen 15 days in which the 
standard had been violated compared with six expected in a normal 
year the peak reading 019 ppm on thursday has not been matched 
in nine years 
chicago has had nine days over the standard compared with an 
estimated seven in a normal year the city issued its first 
yellow alert in a decade the first step up from an advisory

a new law making it harder for some commonwealth 
citizens to immigrate to britain takes effect aug 1 over 
objections from critics who say it is discriminatory and will break 
up families 
under the law male commonwealth citizens living in britain will 
have to prove they can financially support their families before 
relatives living abroad are allowed to join them 
the law will require proof that the families have somewhere to 
live in britain and that a marriage was not entered into primarily 
for immigration reasons 
the aug 1 startup date for the new law written by prime 
minister margaret thatchers conservative government was announced 
friday by the home office which is responsible for immigration 
the opposition labor party opposed the law as it proceeded 
through parliament but failed to stop it the bill formally became 
law on may 10 but left it up to the government to announce when the 
new measures would come into force 
this is a shameful betrayal of the promises given by 
successive home secretaries and will cause great misery and 
hardship said roy hattersley the deputy leader of the labor 
party he said labor would fight for immigration controls that 
respect family unity 
the government said the new law was necessary because it was 
being left with the responsibility of supporting families of 
immigrants who couldnt afford to do so themselves 
the government also charged that in some cases marriages were 
entered into solely to permit people who would not otherwise be 
allowed in to come to britain 
timothy renton a junior minister of state at the home office 
said the changes will improve our ability to carry through 
the governments commitment to a system of immigration control 
which is both firm and fair 
of britains 56 million people an estimated 24 million are 
nonwhite mostly immigrants who arrived after world war ii from 
the socalled new commonwealth countries of asia africa and west 
indies and their descendants 
the commonwealth is a 48member organization of britain and its 
former colonies critics said the new measures unfairly target 
bangladeshis in particular the last wave of immigrants of the 
commonwealth 
in 1961 the annual number of immigrants coming to britain from 
new commonwealth countries reached 136000 the next year britain 
introduced its first controls on immigration by commonwealth 
citizens 
more curbs introduced by successive governments followed and 
the annual number of immigrants admitted to britain now stands at 
under 47000 the lowest level 1962

nearly 40000 people have applied for 
political asylum in west germany in the first six months of 1988

minister friedrich zimmermann said saturday 
he said if the number of asylum seekers continued to grow at the 
present rate the annual total could equal the record years of 1980 
and 1987 when more than 100000 people requested asylum 
by the end of june 39885 people had applied for asylum about 
36 percent of them from soviet bloc countries zimmermann said

in the aftermath of labor unrest this past 
spring the government is moving to hasten economic reform 
increase supplies of consumer goods and legalize some independent 
groups in hopes of heading off more outbursts 
but some opposition quarters doubt the government will succeed 
and that more strikes are inevitable 
an unknown factor however is mikhail s gorbachev the 
reformist soviet leader who is scheduled to visit poland sometime 
soon 
five strikes in poland from april 25 to may 10 and brief 
stoppages or strike threats in 25 more workplaces constituted the 
worst labor unrest in the country since the 1981 martiallaw 
crackdown on the solidarity independent trade union 
the spring strikers demanded the legalization of solidarity and 
wage increases to counter price increases of 45 percent so far this 
year 
the rising prices are part of the governments multifaceted 
program to reform the moribund economy 
the program calls for introducing market equilibrium through 
higher prices encouraging private and managerial enterprise and 
reducing central economic controls all similar to what gorbachev 
is attempting in the soviet union 
the recent events produced an impulse to think deeper and move 
faster said one senior communist party activist speaking only 
on condition of anonymity there is no way back the only way is 
forward and forward with much bigger steps 
the polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski emphasized the need 
for quick improvements in production in an unusual eighthour 
meeting june 5 with the directors of the countrys 41 largest 
enterprises 
jerzy malkowski spokesman for the economic reform program said 
the government plans to introduce some steps ahead of schedule 
longawaited laws on setting up private businesses and easing 
limits on foreign investment were approved by the government 
shortly after the strikes and are expected to be enacted by the 
sejm parliament 
in one of the first uses of new special economic powers the 
government cut off tax benefits for companies that increase exports 
at the expense of supplies for the domestic market malkowski said 
on the political front the government has signaled that it will 
grant legal status to several independent groups including the 
economic society whose aim is to promote and aid private 
businesses a warsaw political discussion club and the dormant 
polish chapter of the pen writers club 
but authorities remain firmly opposed to legalizing solidarity 
an issue that many in the opposition regard as the litmus test of 
officials sincerity in reaching an accord 
the communist party activist said legalizing solidarity would 
lead to an escalation of pay demands in the factories which he 
maintained poland cannot afford in its current economic condition 
when the economy improves he argued authorities can then think of 
allowing union pluralism 
the answer does not satisfy solidarity activists 
the basic question at the moment is whether on the part of 
the authorities there is political willingness for deep changes in 
the system said bronislaw geremek a historian and leading 
adviser to solidarity poland at the moment needs a spectacular 
change so that it could create a psychological shock 
otherwise he added there is no possibility of launching 
political and economic changes 
legalizing groups like pen would have been signs of 
extraordinary political significance a year ago before the 
strikes said geremek but now they are too little too late 
because they are addressed to a limited circle of intellectuals and 
do not try to answer worker frustrations he said 
malkowski acknowledges that the average pole has seen very few 
benefits of the economic reform program so far and contends that is 
hindering public support 
obviously one does not convince people by rhetoric and words 
but by facts this is why i say this year the problem is that we 
have too few facts 
the situation should be better next year when he said people 
will see the effects of a freer marketplace and greater competition 
and supplies 
now we have the paradoxical situation in which an item is more 
expensive and not available he added i think this is one of 
the more significant factors arousing social frustration as long 
as the warehouses and stores do not get filled with goods society 
will question the sense of price increases

pentagon spokesman dan howard admits he is no 
expert on the high technology of the iranian airliner crisis but 
after more than 15 years in the state department and at the white 
house neither is he any stranger to dealing with reporters in 
times of trouble 
for nearly 2 hours during the past week howard fielded 
questions in the cramped pentagon briefing room about such things 
as transponders air corridors black boxes and the differences 
between mode 2 and mode 3 electronic signals 
he had been a state department public affairs officer dealing 
with the philippines when president ferdinand marcos was forced 
from office 
he had been spokesman for the us embassy in cyprus when shiite 
gunmen seized a twa airliner and killed navy diver robert stethem 
he had been expelled from poland for his contacts with polish 
intellectuals after the warsaw government declared martial law in 
1981 
he had been a standin spokesman at the white house at the 
height of the irancontra crisis 
but nothing in his career had been quite like this 
its a very different environment from the white house he 
said in an interview everybody has an opinion and a point of 
view and the place is so big there are so many points of view 
there are so many kinds of experts and not all those experts 
agree and so we have the battle of the experts in the briefing 
room some of the time 
the longtime news people here are the ones that on some 
issues its very difficult to deal with because you end up 
getting a counterbriefing from the floor 
in the giveandtake howard sometimes simply has told reporters 
that their questions go beyond his technical knowledge saying for 
example i am not the final authority on widths of air 
corridors 
i am simply trying to explain the matter the best i can with 
the information available to me he said thursday 
television newspaper and magazine reporters covering the 
pentagon generally agree that he has done a good job although to 
some he seemed a bit impatient at times 
he gets testy over some things as most any briefing officer 
does but by and large he tries to be helpful said carl 
rochelle pentagon correspondent for cable news network he tries 
to answer your questions if he cant answer them he tries to make 
it clear to you that he cant answer them and sometimes he even 
tries to help when he cant answer 
bruce van voorst national security correspondent for time 
magazine said im amazed that dan dares to stand up in front of 
that crowd out there which is for the most part a pretty 
professional operation and talk about mode 2 or mode 3 operations 
and that sort of stuff he has obviously made every effort to at 
least become reasonably familiar with the technical issues he was 
talking about 
david evans pentagon correspondent of the chicago tribune 
said i was very pleased on tuesday that he took an hour to have 
i think a viable exchange with the assembled reporters 
the twiceweekly pentagon briefings usually last about half an 
hour tuesdays was roughly an hour and thursdays was more than 80 
minutes almost entirely devoted to the shooting down of an iranian 
airbus by the us cruiser vincennes on sunday 
this is not the kind of a story that any spokesman likes to 
deal with of course but all you can do is the best you can 
said howard 
the spokesman 45 from chattanooga tenn is married and has 
three children the oldest a boy studying astronomy at boston 
university his wife mary a real estate agent watched him brief 
on thursday for the first time 
although he may not know everything about transponders howard 
does have some technological expertise he can call upon he is an 
old car buff and likes to fix them up himself 
the airliner incident and the current investigation of defense 
department procurement are the biggest stories he has had to handle 
since he came to the pentagon in february as assistant secretary of 
defense for public affairs from his previous post as a deputy white 
house press secretary 
the week after the procurement story broke in midjune howard 
had planned to go on vacation he hasnt had the vacation yet

because he is vice president as well as the 
certain republican presidential nominee george bush must contend 
with twin staffs and insiders say the two sometimesfeuding 
factions have produced an ongoing tugofwar over policy 
a sharing of responsibility for bushs daily activity between 
chief of staff craig fuller and campaign manager lee atwater is 
causing tensions within the bush operation according to campaign 
officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
and while bush has a committee of six trusted advisers to 
oversee the broad strokes of his campaign advisers claim that turf 
battles are likely to continue until the vacant seat at the end of 
the table is occupied 
thats the chair reserved for the stillunfilled post of 
campaign chairman presumably being left open for treasury 
secretary james a baker iii 
at this point with all due respect to everybody whos down 
there the final decisionmaker is not in the room said 
republican consultant eddie mahe a bush campaign adviser 
although officials in recent days have made efforts to smooth 
over differences including a wellpublicized strategy session 
last week among president reagan bush and top white house and 
campaign aides bush campaign workers still report some rough 
going in the coordination department 
atwater is in charge of bushs campaign staff and oversees all 
political activity fuller who works out of bushs vice 
presidential office in the old executive office building and is on 
the public payroll deals with the official vice presidential side 
of bushs routine including scheduling 
however insiders said that fuller has far more input over the 
entire bush operation including all details of campaign 
appearances and policy than organizational charts might suggest 
fuller has got the keys said a bush campaign adviser 
familiar with bushs campaign operations 
the adviser said fuller has enormous say on all matters dealing 
with bushs schedule and these days bushs schedule not 
surprisingly is mostly political 
often it gets to be a real bureaucratic problem said the 
adviser who declined to be identified by name 
fuller and atwater said no frictions exist and suggested that 
the bush campaign is well oiled 
but officials in both offices claim privately that while fuller 
and atwater make a show of working together there are many times 
when one side of the operation doesnt know what the other side is 
doing 
frustrations about a lack of such coordination prompted the 
former campaign communications director peter teeley to quit his 
job in may 
for one thing until recently bush had two separate press staffs 
one answerable to atwater the other to fuller 
now all campaignrelated inquiries are fielded through the 
office of shelia tate bushs new press secretary who said she has 
unbridled input and access to bush 
one of her first acts was to put a halt to the mailing of bush 
campaign speeches to news organizations by the office of the vice 
president at taxpayers expense 
james lake bushs senior communications adviser said there 
still may be glitches but fewer than before sometimes the 
campaign may seem top heavy but thats whats required if its 
going to work 
david carmen a gop consultant said that fragmented 
jurisdiction is not new with the bush campaign the reagan 
campaign had a lot of factions im sure its frustrating for 
everybody involved but they both atwater and fuller have valid 
perspectives 
however carmen said bush should leave the campaigning to 
atwater and the scheduling to fuller then theyll be in good 
shape 
the campaign is overseen by a sort of board of directors 
composed of fuller atwater media consultant roger ailes pollster 
robert teeter and two close friends of bush former new jersey sen 
nicholas brady and texas oilman robert mossbacher 
the group meets sometimes as frequently as once a week to 
discuss strategy 
according to fuller general concepts of the vice presidents 
schedule are discussed at these meetings but not the details 
which he said are worked out between himself and atwater 
ed rogers deputy to atwater said that weve done all right 
so far in seeking to coordinate the different roles of the office 
of vice president and the campaign office in the meetings of the 
six campaign officials everybody brings a unique set of 
responsibilities to the table he said 
treasury secretary baker is expected to join the campaign around 
the time of the republican convention aug 1518 
meanwhile friction between an official staff and a campaign 
staff come with the territory when an incumbent is running 
either for reelection or for higher office said gop consultant 
mahe 
there are going to be misunderstandings there is going to be 
confusion there are going to be personality battles there are 
going to be ego wars mahe said 
but it will never be as brutal as it is to deal with an 
incumbent us senator because at least here the two staffs may 
be in different buildings but the buildings are only four blocks 
apart when youve got an omnipotent us senators staff and a 
poor campaign staff out in the state someplace then you have real 
double grief

vice president george bush rules out paying reparations to 
irans government but says the reagan administration is considering 
compensating families of the 290 people killed when the us navy 
shot down an iranian jetliner michael dukakis says some form of 
humanitarian assistance would probably be appropriate 
bush the republican presidential nomineetobe said friday in 
atlanta he feels terribly sad for the families of those people 
who died in the downing of the iranian passenger plane by an 
american warship in the persian gulf last sunday 
i would never ever under any circumstances offer reparations 
to the iranian government bush said he added that he 
understands payments to the victims families are being considered 
by the administration 
in washington president reagan also said the question of 
compensating the families is among matters under consideration 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said there were still some 
open questions on the compensation issue 
dukakis indicated friday in texas that he favors payments to the 
families i think some form of humanitarian assistance would 
probably be appropriate said the massachusetts governor and 
likely democratic presidential nominee 
bush told nebraska republicans today via a telephone hookup that 
polls showing people think dukakis is more conservative than he is 
are crazy nutty 
speaking from washington dc to more than 300 delegates of 
the state gop bush said dukakis is a cardcarrying member of the 
american civil liberties union while i am a cardcarrying 
member of the national rifle association 
dukakis planned to campaign in california oregon and 
washington jesse jackson scheduled a meeting in san francisco with 
supporters of his democratic presidential campaign 
republicans were continuing their unity rally today in atlanta 
scene of the democratic national convention july 1825 and 
prepared to hear from bushs former rivals bob dole of kansas 
senate gop leader and rep jack kemp of new york 
addressing the republican rally friday bush stressed national 
defense policy and said multilateralism seems to be my opponents 
answer to soviet aggression bush contended dukakis would leave 
the united states generally depending on the united nations to 
maintain peace in the world 
at a news conference before the rally bush questioned at 
length about whether his campaign was properly repaying the 
government for the cost of his campaign trips on air force planes 
maintained we are not abusing the public trust 
bush may have used tax money on campaign trips democratic 
national chairman paul kirk said friday at a news conference in 
atlanta where he questioned whether the vice president can travel 
in the next month without violating spending limits 
bush called kirks allegation an outrageous charge 
dukakis meanwhile was still searching for a vice presidential 
choice and campaigned in texas with one potential running mate 
sen lloyd m bentsen jr of texas chairman of the senate finance 
committee im pondering dukakis said of bentsen at a rally 
friday in texarkana 
when asked if he wanted the job bentsen seemed to play down the 
possibility i dont think we have to worry about that bentsen 
said 
in dallas jackson said friday that his campaign does not have 
any veto power in dukakis hunt for someone to share the democratic 
ticket and does not choose to exercise the appearance as though 
we have a veto over anyone in the process 
dukakis responding to news from washington that the nations 
civilian unemployment rate dropped in june to a 14year low of 53 
percent said the figures masked economic suffering 
national unemployment rates dont tell you a great deal about 
what is happening in communities and neighborhoods and regions 
across this country dukakis said for one thing a great many 
of these jobs are lowwage jobs many of them paying no more than 
7000 7500 a year they dont have health insurance he added

hundreds of workers clearing debris 
from the collapse of a department store reached the first floor of 
the threestory building today but had little hope of finding any 
more survivors in the massive pile of rubble 
authorities said at least 16 people were killed and 47 injured 
in the disaster but six survivors four of them children were 
pulled from the debris of the amigo store on friday 
by this time tomorrow morning the building wont be there 
anymore terry ray a construction foreman who was leading the 
digging effort said this morning were no longer allowing any 
tunneling were in the process of taking apart the building layer 
by layer 
police sgt dean poos said rescuers using sensitive equipment 
thought they heard noises including tapping sounds from within 
the rubble and were encouraged 
but later today poos said the workers believed they would not 
find any more survivors 
it doesnt sound like well find anybody else alive poos 
said adding the city had asked for more volunteers to help in the 
cleanup 
the crews here are a little bit tired and we need some help 
poos said 
meanwhile an official told the dallas morning news that clogged 
drainage holes allowed rain to collect on the stores flat roof 
possibly overloading it the roof collapsed during a torrential 
rain thursday afternoon 
the roof is not designed to carry all that weight said 
brownsville building inspector fernando romero its a tragedy 
and one that may happen again at any time 
a sevenmember unit of the pittsburgh pabased special medical 
response team which works in mine disasters arrived late friday 
and burrowed through tunnels dug into the concrete broken 
cinderblocks shattered glass and twisted steel 
things like this are always tough said monte jenkins a 
spokesman for the team of six paramedics and a physician the 
process is to shore up the tunnels to make sure that no one else is 
hurt while we are trying to rescue other people 
the collapse of the threestory store trapped an undetermined 
number of people many of whom were seeking shelter from the rain 
the cause of the collapse remained unknown brownsville mayor 
ygnacio garza said investigations were being launched by the city 
the buildings insurance company and the federal occupational 
safety and health administration 
garza said the rainstorm which poured 2 inches in less than 30 
minutes may have been a factor but that other factors also may 
have played a role 
we have a report from witnesses that a bolt of lightning 
struck behind the building and hit some transformers and perhaps 
knocked them down garza said 
minimal construction standards and inconsistent inspections also 
contributed to the tragedy other officials charged 
that old store was nothing more than a stack of blocks said 
kermit cromack cameron countys tax assessorcollector this was 
bound to happen sooner or later 
a 2yearold girl who was pulled from the rubble friday after 
she was buried nearly a day appeared to have been protected by 
some other people around her who are believed dead said police 
lt victor rodriguez 
a 14yearold girl also rescued was wedged between two concrete 
slabs pamela downing of the citys public utilities board called 
the girl a miracle child for having survived 
cries from the children feedback from microphones and seismic 
tools and dogs trained to search for humans led the rescue crews 
to the survivors 
cheers and wild applause erupted from 300 onlookers as each 
survivor was lifted from the tangle of concrete 
a brownsville maintenance worker freddie gonzalez 34 took 
advantage of his 4foot8 frame to snake his way through the heaps 
of concrete widening a path for two workers who followed in the 
90degree heat 
the people were running out of oxygen gonzalez said we 
ran a little tube through a small hole then we made a bigger hole 
and put in a bigger pipe to get air to the victims 
other rescuers dug a makeshift 17foot tunnel to reach some of 
those trapped

secretary of state george p shultz 
met indonesian officials and said he discussed human rights with 
prime minister mahathir mohamad of malaysia today during his last 
official trip to asia 
shultz arrived in jakarta for talks with president suharto and 
other officials about informal talks scheduled july 25 in the 
indonesian capital aimed at a political settlement of the cambodian 
war 
earlier today in the malaysian capital of kuala lumpur shultz 
met with mahathir for three hours and said the malaysian leader 
assured him prisoners detained without trial in malaysian jails 
would be accorded their full rights 
twentyeight us congressmen the washingtonbased asia watch 
human rights group and the new york citybased lawyers committee 
for human rights asked shultz to bring up concerns over detentions 
under malaysias internal security act in his talks with mahathir 
the two human rights groups said 
the act allows the government to arrest and detain people 
without trial indefinitely 
last fall the prime minister ordered the arrest of 106 people 
critical of his government including the leader of the opposition 
in parliament lim kit siang he said then that their arrests were 
necessary because they had instigated racial clashes between the 
countrys malays and ethnic chinese 
the subject was discussed fundamentally in a satisfactory 
way shultz said speaking to a news conference before leaving 
for jakarta indonesia 
we took note that 71 people have been released and that the 
prime minister and foreign minister assured me that that those 
remaining under detention would be accorded full statutory and 
constitutional rights and as time went on we would see them dealt 
with properly said shultz 
but on friday the malaysian house of representatives voted to 
strengthen the security act so that detainees can no longer 
challenge in court the reasons for their detention in court 
when mahathir became prime minister in july 1981 about 550 
people were held without trial in malaysian prisons 
shultz arrived in malaysia from bangkok thailand where he held 
talks with the foreign ministers of the member countries of the 
association of southeast asian nations 
in jakarta he was met at the military airport by the defense 
minister gen lb murdani shultz will hold talks with suharto 
and foreign minister ali alatas before leaving for the philippines 
monday 
shultz also will visit hong kong china south korea japan and 
new marshall islands republic in the pacific on the trip 
indonesia will be the host of informal talks between cambodias 
vietnambacked government and three guerrilla groups the 
guerrillas have been fighting the government and vietnamese troops 
since vietnam invaded in 1978

the butler didnt do it ruled 12 jurors who 
deliberated the fate of a man accused by his wealthy exemployer of 
stealing two paintings worth more than 500000 
rune gunnar roy donnell a swedish butler who had been 
jailed in lieu of 500000 bail since his arrest last september 
was freed friday after a jury found him innocent of two counts of 
grand theft 
in other words the butler didnt do it said donnells 
attorney donald c randolph 
donnell 62 had worked for elizabeth keck for 15 years but 
quit about three months before she discovered a 19thcentury 
english painting missing from her belair home 
the impressionist work i fria luften by swedishborn artist 
anders zorn was reported missing last september a french work 
fete gallante also was missing 
the paintings were sold to a stockholm sweden firm that paid 
500000 for i fria luften and 5000 for fete gallante 
donnell testified that he received permission to act as mrs 
kecks agent in selling the paintings in stockholm 
mrs keck denied donnells story and told police donnell often 
admired the zorn painting and said it would fetch a high price in 
sweden 
suffice it to say that we feel that the jury was misled by the 
defense said mrs kecks attorney steven knowles he said she 
was considering filing a civil suit 
mrs keck is a trustee of the museum of contemporary art and her 
husband howard b keck is a retired oilman who has been listed by 
forbes magazine as one the countrys 400 richest people

democrats will convene in atlanta next week in a spirit of unity 
and optimism unseen in a dozen years assuming that michael dukakis 
can find a way to have jesse jackson on his side without placing 
him on the ticket 
as the democrats 1988 nomineeinwaiting the 54yearold 
dukakis unquestionably will command center stage in the convention 
city in the heart of dixie 
and a southernstyle political coronation it will be for the man 
from new england from the convention site itself to the selection 
of a texas treasurer ann richards as keynote speaker and the 
decision to have arkansas gov bill clinton place dukakis name in 
nomination a week from wednesday night 
all this from a political party hoping to reclaim at least a 
portion of the south that has become a political desert in recent 
presidential elections with the exception of georgian jimmy 
carters southern success in 1976 en route to the white house 
judging from the public opinion polls the south remains a 
difficult hurdle to overcome for dukakis overall democrats 
havent enjoyed this much of a chance to win the white house since 
carters narrow victory of a dozen years ago even though dukakis 
doubledigit lead of late spring has all but evaporated in the wake 
of persistent attacks by vice president george bush 
while dukakis hold on a nominating majority of the delegates is 
unquestioned and the conventions nightly twohour prime time 
program has been designed to convey his campaign themes jackson 
has reserved a starring role 
hell arrive at the confab at the head of a jackson action 
threeday bus tour but denies his prearranged fanfare will steal 
the thunder from dukakis 
it has nothing to do with thunder mr dukakis had no 
intention of bringing any thunder to atlanta jackson said 
thursday 
the runnerup in the primary season will have the support of 
more than 1100 delegates at the convention and almost certainly 
will have his name placed in nomination on wednesday night 
providing a symbolic challenge to dukakis nomination a noisy 
floor demonstration will ensue 
jacksons campaign is organizing a series of events outside the 
convention hall to maintain enthusiasm in addition rep gus 
savage of illinois a jackson delegate holds a police permit for a 
demonstration outside the omni which is expected to urge dukakis 
to name jackson as his running mate 
and jacksons response to the nomination of the vice 
presidential candidate on the final night of the convention has the 
dukakis campaign on edge the massachusetts governor is widely 
expected to turn elsewhere for his running mate and dukakis aides 
are concerned that rebellious jackson forces may place their man in 
nomination and force a primetime showdown on the final night of 
the convention or perhaps even stage a public walkout 
i think he has been and will be positive no matter what 
happens says rep richard gephardt of missouri a onetime 
primary rival and one of the contenders to be dukakis running mate 
but dukakis aides concede they need support from jackson and 
the millions who voted fo him during the primaries to defeat bush 
in the fall campaign 
jackson himself has provided conflicting clues of his intentions 
in the five weeks since the primaries he has criticized the 
platform campaigned publicly for the vice presidential nomination 
and dismissed the other contenders as unknown quantities yet 
he has spoken consistently of expanding the democratic party and 
when he left boston earlier this week after spending the fourth of 
july with dukakis he said our interests converge 
dukakis says he hopes to settle on a running mate and perhaps 
squeeze in a little campaigning time before flying to atlanta next 
weekend the leading contenders are believed to be sens john glenn 
of ohio bob graham of florida lloyd bentsen of texas and albert 
gore jr of tennessee as well as gephardt and rep lee hamilton of 
indiana 
sens sam nunn of georgia and bill bradley of new jersey have 
ruled themselves out as has house democratic leader tom foley of 
washington 
the vice presidenial issue aside democrats say there is little 
controversy that could seriously mar the fourday spectacle that 
party officials hope will speed dukakis on his way to the white 
house 
disputes over party rules and delegate credentials forums for 
nasty disputes in conventions of the recent past have been ironed 
out between the jackson and dukakis campaigns 
the two sides are expected to continue meeting over their 
platform disagreements but dukakis aides seem to welcome a floor 
vote to reject an expected jackson call to raise taxes on the 
wealthy and to freeze pentagon spending 
unlike the conventions of 1980 or 1984 there has been little 
question that dukakis holds a majority of the delegates and no 
talk of a convention showdown that might loosen his grip 
aside from jackson nearly all of dukakis onetime rivals have 
not only warmly endorsed him but campaigned by his side in recent 
days 
dukakis wrapped up the nomination early and also has benefitted 
from the lack of animosity that has accompanied recent democratic 
races in 1980 sen edward m kennedy waged a lastditch floor 
fight in an unsuccessful attempt to wrest the nomination from 
carter and in 1984 walter f mondale struggled to win his 
nominating majority on the final day of the primary season while 
fending off repeated challenges from gary hart and jackson 
however harmonious the proceedings are inside the hall the 
democrats will attract the normal complement of street 
demonstrators ranging from white supremacists to gay rights 
activists to animal rights groups 
not to mention a group of georgians opposed to a fourlane 
highway to carters presidential library 
republicans will try to grab their share of media attention at 
the democratic meeting they will send several wellknown officials 
to atlanta to make themelves available for newspaper and television 
interviews 
but one groups protest is anothers opportunity 
local leaders figure the convention will be worth roughly 60 
million to the economy 
the georgia tourist division has sent each of the 4000plus 
delegates a can of stategrown popcorn with the words georgias 
popping the hope is to entice some convention goers and their 
convention dollars out of atlanta and into other regions of the 
state

one couple say they will fight an order 
to tear down their nearly complete modern house that was built in 
the towns historic district after the town mistakenly said the 
property was zoned residential 
a second couple are considering a similar fight 
the zoning board voted unanimously thursday to deny fred and 
janet sallah an exception to the zoning ordinance because the shape 
and vertical siding of their siloshaped house are not compatible 
with other buildings in the district 
carolyn baldwin lawyer for the couple said she would seek a 
second hearing and will go to court if the board does not change 
its mind she said state law says such zoning decisions can only be 
made by historic district commissioners and canterbury has none 
another couple debbie and richard desmarais said they were 
considering a suit against the town after they were told they would 
have to modify the ranch house they are building their house also 
is nearly complete 
both couples applied for building permits earlier this year and 
the building inspector told them the property was zoned residential 
later members of the zoning board later acknowledged that the 
town zoning map was erroneous but maintained that the historic 
district and its new england style of architecture should be 
preserved 
harry kinter chairman of the planning board who wanted to halt 
the building and building inspector charles cook who favored 
allowing the building both resigned over the dispute 
the sallahs paid 75000 for their 37 acres less than one mile 
from the center of the town of about 1500 and are building the 
house from a kit valued at 50000 the circular part is two 
stories with a more conventional onestory attachment 
board member jeff brillhart said compensation may be the only 
solution board chairman joe halla said a decision on compensation 
would be left to the town selectmen selectman john pratt said he 
didnt think the sallahs should pay for the towns mistake but he 
did not offer compensation 
baldwin expressed frustration with the towns architectural 
conservatism 
if everybody had built houses that look exactly alike wed 
still be living in wigwams she said you need to allow for 
change and variety

the communist party has readmitted nikolai i 
bukharin a major bolshevik theorist and more than a dozen others 
shot during purges under josef stalin a halfcentury ago tass 
reported saturday 
bukharin had been cleared in february of trumpedup spying 
charges for which he was shot in 1938 but the second step in his 
rehabilitation restoration to party rolls was not taken until now 
political rehabilitation had been expected because bukharins 
moderate economic program contains elements similar to those being 
implemented by soviet leader mikahil s gorbachev 
but in todays communist party announcement the official news 
agency said a special commission of the partys ruling politburo 
found that bukharin and an associate alexei i rykov had made 
mistakes 
however their mistakes and dissenting positions are not of an 
antiparty character the commission said 
the tass dispatch did not detail the mistakes bukharin and rykov 
had made 
in the 1920s bukharin favored a continuation of soviet founder 
vladimir lenins new economic policy which permitted some private 
enterprise and left farms in the hands of the peasants bukharin 
hoped to encourage farmers to combine property voluntarily and move 
onto collective farms 
gorbachevs reforms also allow some private enterprise and 
families to lease farmland from their collective and state farms 
and till the soil themselves 
last november gorbachev announced that the drive to 
rehabilitate the millions of victims of stalins purges would 
resume stalin ruled from 1924 to his death in 1953 
tass said the politburo commission heard a report from the party 
control committee saying bukharin and rykov expelled from the 
party in march 1937 were readmitted june 21 the news agency did 
not explain why it took 2 weeks to announce the action 
fourteen other victims of stalins purges who had been tried 
along with bukharin and rykov were also restored to party rolls 
tass said

the chairman of the house armed services 
committee said saturday he sees eight possible explanations for why 
the cruiser vincennes shot down an iranian passenger jetliner a 
week ago 
there is evidence that both supports and discredits each of the 
explanations according to rep les aspin dwis 
the bottom line is that we do not yet have a bottom line he 
said 
pentagon officials are reviewing last sundays incident in the 
strait of hormuz when the cruiser fired a missile and knocked down 
the airliner and killed all 290 people aboard in the mistaken 
belief that it was an iranian f14 fighter 
aspin along with other legislators have received a series of 
classified briefings on pentagon efforts to determine the sequence 
of events and why the missiles were fired 
aspin said the main question centers around pentagon claims that 
the vincennes was receiving signals from the jet on a frequency 
reserved for military transmissions those transmissions led to the 
belief than an f14 jet fighter was approaching the cruiser navy 
officials say 
according to aspin the possible explanations for the attack are 
there were no military signals that would mean the ships 
aegis air defense system that detected the signals malfunctioned 
aegis has problems aspin noted but those problems dont include 
picking up signals that arent there 
human error aboard the cruiser in reading the signals aspin 
noted that although the crew members were experienced in reading 
aegis information they hadnt spent much time in the volatile gulf 
the united states intended to fire at a civilian plane aspin 
noted that argument is made by iranian officials and he gave it no 
credence 
the iranian plane was carrying a military transponder on 
purpose which would have sent the fighterlike signals because it 
sometimes used the plane to ferry troops to combat 
the jetliner was carrying a military transponder that was 
unknowingly turned on aspin noted that a transponder may have been 
taken from military stockpiles but he also noted that there is no 
previous evidence that such a move occurred 
the jet was carrying a transponder that was activated on 
purpose in hopes of causing the navy to attack 
the militarytype signals were sent from an f14 that was 
flying elsewhere in the gulf 
the militarytype signals were sent from an f14 that was 
flying in extremely close vicinity to the airbus

hospitalized said abdul latif a senior official in quilon a town 
near the accident site at least 1000 police and navy personnel

into the accident he announced that victims families would be 
given 100000 rupees or 7142 in compensation 
during a news conference in quilon he refused to comment on the 
cause of the accident 
latif a magistrate in quilon district said train engineer t 
paul reported that the train developed mechanical trouble paul was 
not hurt 
latif reached by telephone quoted paul as saying that the 
fastmoving train suddenly braked before the derailment 
at this stage we cannot be sure if it was human error or 
mechanical failure latif said 
several survivors told indian news agencies that they believed 
the crew applied the brakes just before the train derailed 
government television and indian news agencies reported that a 
cavein on the 540foot bridge caused the derailment 
matthew john a railway safety official said two spans of the 
bridge were damaged but that investigators believe this happened as 
the train cars plunged into the water 
most of the victims died from drowning latif said 
the line of grieving relatives outside hospitals in quilon 
stretched for a mile news agency reports said 
the crash was keralas worst train accident but both witnesses 
and officials said fatalities could have been worse without quick 
rescue work by fishermen and farmers 
paddling dozens of long narrow fishing boats they rushed to 
the wreckage and pulled out more than 200 passengers before rescue 
workers could make it though the jungle to the lake 
the indian railway system is the second largest in the world 
carrying more than 9 million passengers dailybut train accidents 
are common and claim hundreds of lives annually last year 227 
people died in 613 train accidents in india 
the worlds worst train accident occurred in india according to 
the guinness book of records more than 800 people were killed when 
a train plunged into a floodswollen river in the eastern state of 
bihar in june 1981 guinness said

intelligence reports indicate the soviet union 
may be ready to withdraw up to 65000 troops from hungary 
according to a senior state department official 
a pullout from the east european country has long been a subject 
of speculation here and in western allied capitals soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev has already begun pulling back in afghanistan 
while sovietbacked vietnam has announced a troop withdrawal in 
cambodia 
the us official who briefed reporters friday under rules of 
anonymity said the united states would welcome the hungary 
pullout he said gorbachev may have already passed the word about 
it to warsaw pact leaders 
last year gorbachev set the stage for a nuclear missile 
reduction treaty with the united states by announcing soviet 
shortrange rockets would be withdrawn from eastern europe 
the prospective move on hungary could be a preliminary step to a 
soviet acceptance of western terms for holding wideranging 
negotiations to reduce conventional troops and armor concentrations 
in europe 
at the same time the soviet leader is faced with growing unrest 
in several eastern countries including hungary where economic 
conditions are falling short of workers expectations 
a recent change in government in budapest seemed to indicate 
hungary in some ways the most liberalized of the communist states 
was about to embark on a reform program matching gorbachevs 
perestroika policies at home 
in prague on friday soviet premier nikolai ryzhkov repeated a 
kremlin proposal to withdraw the red army from all foreign 
territory by the year 2000 
but the soviet government chief told western reporters that such 
moves could come only in the context of a general withdrawal 
involving other nations as well as the soviet union 
our proposal is this let us take out all the armies he 
said the armies in czechoslovakia are part of the warsaw pact 
armies let us agree on a radical solution in the west and in the 
east

nuclear power plants across the nation may 
have bought used circuit breakers that were falsely labeled as new 
according to documents filed in federal court by the nuclear 
regulatory commission 
the nrc is investigating five southern california companies for 
their alleged role in supplying the circuit breakers which serve 
the same function as fuses in shutting off power to prevent short 
circuits or fires 
the nrc is unsure where the breakers are being used or what 
dangers they present except that they appear prone to failure 
officials said 
after seizing documents during searches at the companies 
offices thursday the nrc sent notices friday to nuclear power 
plants across the united states 
we are advising plant operators of what we are doing but we 
are not asking them to do anything at this time said frank 
ingham an nrc spokesman in washington 
it is too early to determine the extent of the potential 
problem ingham said 
federal officials said the used breakers were first discovered 
at the diablo canyon nuclear power plant near san luis obispo when 
they failed tests there four months ago 
according to court documents the breakers that failed at diablo 
canyon were purchased for use in nonsafetyrelated areas or areas 
that are separate from a plants nuclear reactor 
however an examination of breakers seized from the five 
companies showed that it would be possible for power plant workers 
to believe that a breaker was new and to upgrade a circuit 
breaker to a safetysystem use wrote robert marsh the nrcs 
regional director of investigations 
according to a warrant filed in federal court the following 
companies were searched ats circuit breakers general circuit

protesters in six towns and cities today as palestinians heeded 
underground uprising leaders and shut down the occupied gaza strip

the army put the injured figure at 11 saying it included an 
arab teenager who suffered a bullet wound after a clash in the 
gaza strip and a soldier who was hit in the shoulder by a large 
rock 
the violence broke out a day after israel launched a crackdown 
on the uprising by ordering 10 palestinians deported after accusing 
them of planning a series of antiisraeli attacks and riots 
todays strikes paralyzed commercial life by shutting shops and 
halting public transportation in arab east jerusalem nablus 
ramallah hebron bethlehem and gaza city 
in one clash soldiers opened fire at the aida refugee camp near 
bethlehem after several palestinians tried to grab a gun from one 
of the troops and one of them threw stones an army spokesman said 
six arabs were injured by rubber bullets the spokesman said 
troops also confronted rioters outside the villages of abwein 
and arura near the west bank town of ramallah beating and injuring

reasonable force to detain arab protesters after several dozen 
of the demonstrators blocked roads near the villages and pelted 
troops with large blocks 
one soldier was hit in the shoulder by a block and taken for 
medical treatment the army said 
troops also injured three arab protesters during a 90minute 
clash in bani naim near hebron arab news reports said

republican leaders on saturday took turns 
assailing michael dukakis in a rally just nine days before 
democrats gather in the same city nominate the massachusetts 
governor for president 
if youre undertaxed vote for dukakis if youre overtaxed 
we want you in our party proclaimed rep jack kemp rny 
one of several of vice president george bushs former challengers 
for the gop nomination 
sen bob dole rkan another former contender said were 
not going to run around this country and try to bloody up the 
opposition but lets contain dukakis to massachusetts 
the rally was the third in a series designed to raise money and 
demonstrate republican solidarity the first two were in denver and 
cincinnati 
the theme of this weekends meeting was winning the south bush 
kicked off the weekend with a speech to a friday night rally 
predicting the south would be solid for republicans in november 
playing on a theme the gop will use repeatedly in the south he 
attacked dukakis national defense policy as too reliant on us 
allies and not strong enough on nuclear arms and the star wars 
missile defense system 
we dont want to rain on the democrats parade theyll do it 
by themselves bush said evoking cheers and laughter from the 
partisan crowd 
some of the souths top elected republicans joined in the rally 
with appearances saturday including south carolina gov carroll 
campbell sen strom thurmond also from south carolina gov bob 
martinez of florida and sen mitch mcconnell of kentucky 
thurmond called dukakis a mere midget compared to george 
bush 
martinez said the differences in experience between bush and 
dukakis amounted to the tale of the tall and the short using 
the same analogy as thurmond referring to the difference in height 
between the two candidates 
can you imagine the folly of them coming down south and 
holding their convention said lee atwater bushs national 
campaign manager and a south carolina native in his speech 
saturday 
atwater said the convention would serve to highlight issues 
where dukakis record would cost him votes in the south including 
that as governor he has been dumb enough to raise taxes in the 
middle of a campaign 
dukakis support of gun control opposition to the death 
penalty and the problems with massachusetts prison furlough 
program also would make dukakis unpalatable to southernors he said 
atwater said dukakis indecision on a running mate was making 
hamlet look like the rock of gibralter 
after the rest of the public gets to know him dukakis in the 
south this guy couldnt get elected dog catcher down here he 
said 
dole said dukakis is simply embarrassed by american power 
have you heard him say one kind word about president reagans 
arms control triumph in moscow he said referring to 
implementation of the ussoviet treaty banning medium and 
shorterrange nuclear missiles 
bush did not attend saturdays sessions flying off late friday 
for his home in kennebunkport maine 
despite the rhetoric atwater predicted that bush would fall in 
the polls following the democratic national convention because of 
all the media attention dukakis will receive he said most voters 
would not decide until the final weeks of the campaign and then 
voters will move to bush when they find out what an honest 
decent fellow he is

president reagan saying that the time for 
excuses and delays is long past appealed to democrats in 
congress today to appoint members to a task force aimed at 
stripping politics from the national drug debate 
in his weekly radio address delivered from the oval office the 
president also disclosed that white house employes were given 
notice on friday that random drug testing will begin in 60 days 
reagan recounted the formation of just say no clubs as part 
of first lady nancy reagans antidrug campaign among youth and 
said i figure if young people across the country can come 
together against illegal drugs then why shouldnt the grownups in 
washington be able to do the same 
in may i proposed that both houses of congress both sides of 
the aisle join together with our administration in a bipartisan 
executivelegislative task force to advance americas uniform 
antidrug policy 
if we are going to get the drugs out of schools we need to 
get the politics out of drugs he said 
i believe that partisan bickering or seeking political 
advantage can only impede our progress in seeking to achieve a 
drugfree america the president said 
i hope that the democratic leaders in congress will now join 
in this united effort he said the time for excuses and delays 
is long past

in the democratic response to the presidents speech rep 
charles b rangel of new york chairman of the house committee on 
narcotics abuse and control also discussed the drug issue saying 
that outgoing attorney general edwin meese iii had failed the 
american people by not putting together the type of cabinet team 
necessary to start the fight in the war on drugs 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
before reagan prodded democrats to get on board his joint 
executivelegislative task force presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater voiced hope that the appointments would still be made 
asked why democrats had not yet done so fitzwater said well 
we believe they will because theyve expressed interest in the 
drug issue they have said they care about it and would like to 
develop some initiative 
theyre waiting to get reports from their committee chairmen 
and others who are advising them i just cant imagine after all 
the talk theyve made around the country on drugs that they 
wouldnt want to participate 
reagan said may 16 in a speech to the graduating class of the 
coast guard academy that the national drug policy debate had become 
too politicized at the time he called on democratic and 
republican members of congress to join the executive branch on a 
task force to recommend solutions 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan and house minority 
leader robert michel rill named members of their chambers to 
the task force some time ago 
but house speaker jim wright dtexas and senate majority 
leader robert c byrd dwva have not named their members 
reagan had said in the coast guard address that little headway 
could be made in the effort to combat drug abuse and drug 
trafficking so long as national debate on the issue took on 
partisan tones 
reagan did direct the members of the task force to concentrate 
on strategies aimed at attacking demand for illegal narcotics the 
president had said in the past that interdiction efforts would be 
futile so long as demand continued unabated 
the president sent his marching orders to the 
executivelegislative task force as republican senators unveiled a 
15billionayear antidrug plan that would install a top drug 
enforcement officer in the presidents cabinet deny federal 
benefits to users and allow the death penalty for convicted dealers 
the measure sponsored by dole and 10 gop colleagues also would 
boost the drugenforcement authority of the border patrol and 
forest service launch a federal initiative against gangs and crack 
down on illegal use of firearms 
in his statement reagan said much has already been done but 
there is much more to do the task force offers us the rare 
opportunity to lift the battle above politics to make broad 
progress with bipartisan policy we must not rest until the 
message to every drug user is clear we mean business no more 
drugs

in parliament lim kit siang mahathir said then that their arrests 
were necessary because they had instigated racial clashes between 
the countrys malays and ethnic chinese 
the subject was discussed fundamentally in a satisfactory 
way shultz said at a news conference before leaving for jakarta 
indonesia 
we took note that 71 people have been released and that the 
prime minister and foreign minister assured me that that those 
remaining under detention would be accorded full statutory and 
constitutional rights and as time went on we would see them dealt 
with properly said shultz 
twentyeight us congressmen the washingtonbased asia watch 
human rights group and the new york citybased lawyers committee 
for human rights had asked shultz to bring up american concerns 
over the detentions with mahathir according to the two human 
rights groups 
the official bernama news agency reported that the amendments 
passed by the house among other things prohibited any action 
suit prosecution or any other legal proceedings from being 
brought instituted or maintained in respect of any detention 
fortyseven representatives supported the amendments and 18 were 
opposed the amendments will go to the senate for approval later 
this month and then to the king before they become law 
the senate is dominated by government appointees and the king 
like britains queen elizabeth is a constitutional head and 
normally signs all laws passed by the legislature 
by completely depriving the right of the people to seek legal 
redress in court the situation is worse than during the colonial 
days former foreign minister rais yatim a governing party 
member who opposes mahathir said during the parliamentary debate 
malaysia won independence from britain in 1957 and inherited the 
internal security act from the days of colonial rule 
lee lam thai acting leader of the parliamentary opposition 
said the amendments would prohibit anyone who has been improperly 
detained from asking a court to secure his release 
deputy home affairs minister megat junid megat ayub said during 
the debate the government would not abuse its powers and that the 
internal security act was necessary for the security of the country 
the us congressmen and human rights groups have called for the 
detainees to be brought to trial or released 
about 80 people now are being held under the act when mahathir 
became prime minister in july 1981 more than 500 people were under 
detention

of tightened security measures following a series of bombings 
a mine attached to a telephone pole exploded outside the 
clubhouse of a field hockey team in a johannesburg suburb no 
serious injuries were reported 
at a rugby match in cape town a police helicopter circled the 
stadium

as spectators left a rugby match two people died and 35 were 
injured other recent targets included a video game arcade and a 
beachfront restaurant 
on saturday a large police contingent was on duty at pretorias 
main rugby stadium spectators arriving for the game were searched 
as they entered the grounds and mine detectors were used to scan 
underneath vehicles entering parking lots

national congress guerrilla movement which has neither claimed nor 
denied responsibility the anc is the main group fighting to 
overthrow south africas government 
authorities across the country have launched a bomb awareness 
campaign to encourage greater public vigilance city officials in 
johannesburg are publicizing a special emergency telephone number

teddy bears are the newest tool of streetsavvy 
police in the miami area whose officers routinely deal with armed 
drug smugglers and other criminals 
i think these teddy bears will be a great tool in working with 
children we plan to stock at least two teddy bears in each patrol 
car and well start using them sometime next week in 50 of our 
patrol cars in the northwest miami area to see how it works out 
said metrodade cmdr lou diecidue 
when a child sees a police officer in a negative situation 
like an accident or maybe a child abuse case that child is usually 
very frightened diecidue said 
we hope that offering these teddy bears will ease a lot of 
that initial pain and fright they experience 
miami police sgt roberson brown said all three shifts of his 
patrol units will carry the bears and distribute them among poor 
children throughout the city 
we think this is a great idea and we hope it will bridge the 
gap sometimes existing between a small child and a police 
officer brown said 
miami radio station wpowfm is working with area burdines 
department stores to collect at least 5000 teddy bears for 
donation to miami metrodade hollywood and the broward sheriffs 
police agencies 
wpow assistant promotions director lori alterman said the idea 
came from a magazine article mentioning that seattle patrol 
officers carry teddy bears 
we felt that if the officers approaching a crime scene where a 
child is involved offer that child a teddy bear to hug and hold and 
keep for his own it would help ease a lot of the fear and anxiety 
that the child experiences at that moment ms alterman said 
we see it as a stranger offering the child something thats 
not so strange

president reagan lauded outgoing attorney 
general edwin meese iii today as a public servant of dedication 
and integrity whose name has been cleared 
reagans weekly radio address delivered from the oval office 
coincided with a published report that independent counsel james c 
mckays investigation of the attorney general shows that meese 
initially indicated he may have had knowledge about possibly 
illegal payments to the israeli labor party in connection with a 1 
billion iraqi oil pipeline project 
meese announced his upcoming resignation tuesday the day 
mckays report which has not been made public was filed in court 
the attorney general said the independent counsels investigation 
vindicates him 
with the announcement by ed meese now that his name has been 
cleared that he will be returning to private life this summer i 
would like to take a minute to recognize a public servant of 
dedication and integrity who has been a close friend for over 20 
years the president said 
as counselor at the white house and as attorney general ed 
meese worked for stricter sentencing to put dangerous criminals 
behind bars and also for greater resources for drug enforcement 
and to fight organized crime reagan said 
he said meese also led our justice department as it 
aggressively achieved more convictions for civil rights 
violations than any previous administration 
he also praised meeses antiterrorism efforts saying he 
worked closely with our allies to detect apprehend and prosecute 
those who wage war on innocent members of free societies

the new york times which obtained portions of the independent 
counsels report reported today that meese was asked in november 
1987 by mckay about his understanding of a memorandum from longtime 
friend e robert wallach on the pipeline 
mckay asked whether meese understood when he received the memo 
in september 1985 that a portion of the pipeline funds would go 
directly to the political party 
mckay asked was that your understanding in september 1985 
that was the arrangement 
meese replied again i cant recall specifically but that 
certainly would be consistent with my understanding and would 
explain why mr thenisraeli prime minister shimon peres was 
personally interested 
however two months later meese submitted a clarification of 
his testimony saying he didnt recall that part of the memo the 
clarification came a few weeks after the first news accounts 
reported that the memo from wallach to meese mentioned planned 
payments to the labor party constituting a possible violation of 
the foreign corrupt practices act 
meeses lawyers nathan lewin and james rocap told the times 
that meese had been consistent in his statements about his 
knowledge of the plan to make payments to the israeli labor party 
lewin said meese does not recall reading the portion of the memo 
dealing with payments to the political party and that is what meese 
meant to say when he gave the statement to mckay in november 1987 
mckay determined that the memo was the only direct evidence of a 
bribery plan and that the available evidence is therefore 
insufficient to conclude meeses activities on behalf of the 
pipeline violated the corrupt practices act 
the independent counsel said his pipeline investigation was 
hampered because israeli officials including peres were 
unavailable to be questioned and several american witnesses invoked 
their right not to incriminate themselves 
mckay also said a sensitive justice department memo to meese 
about the pipeline was missing from his department files meese had 
testified he had received the memo and might have shared it with 
wallach said the report 
the memo dealt with a financial option pertaining to possible 
us backing for the financial and security guarantees for the 
pipeline according to the report 
the memo from a department attorney and written at wallachs 
urging recommended a possible solution to the legal problem 
department officials were unable to locate it in meeses files 
said the report 
mckay also found that meese was closely involved in 1985 in 
discussions about building the pipeline mckay said the project was 
of limited interest to the us government until meese made a 
highly unusual phone call to the white house in 1985 at 
wallachs request wallach was representing one of the projects 
partners swiss oilman bruce rappaport meese repeatedly has 
characterized his involvement in the project as limited 
the mckay report also said deputy attorney general arnold burns 
told mckay he was astonished because meese told him that an 
offer of a high justice department job to wallach was still pending 
even after meese learned that wallach was the subject of a criminal 
investigation 
the report says meese learned from his subordinates on april 6 
1987 that wallach who currently is under indictment on 
racketeering charges in the wedtech scandal was the subject of a 
federal criminal probe of wedtech corp a south bronx ny 
defense contractor 
meese immediately recused himself from all involvement in 
wedtech matters but subsequently told burns he had offered mr 
wallach the position of counselor to the attorney general and 
that the offer was still open 
burns told mckays office he was astonished to hear this 
from meese but maintained a poker face and responded by saying 
oh the report said william bradford reynolds head of the 
departments civil rights division eventually got the job instead 
of wallach

here is the text of president reagans radio 
address saturday 
my fellow americans today i want to tell you about some new 
antidrug initiatives but first with the announcement by ed 
meese now that his name has been cleared that hell be returning 
to private life this summer id like to take a minute to recognize 
a public servant of dedication and integrity who has been a close 
friend for over 20 years 
as counselor at the white house and as attorney general ed 
meese worked for stricter sentencing to put dangerous criminals 
behind bars and also for greater resources for drug enforcement 
and to fight organized crime and in a system usually focused on 
the criminal he never forgot the victims of crime or their rights 
as attorney general ed meese led our effort to appoint highly 
qualified federal judges who would crack down on crime and also 
faithfully interpret the constitution he led our justice 
department as it aggressively defended civil rights in fact this 
administration has achieved more convictions for civil rights 
violations than any previous administration 
in fighting terrorism attorney general meese worked closely 
with our allies to detect apprehend and prosecute those who wage 
war on innocent members of free societies and in our campaign 
against the menace of illegal drugs ed meese has been a central 
figure serving as chairman of the national drug policy board 
now let me turn to our antidrug efforts i believe that drug 
testing is a key tool to help promote public safety and a drugfree 
work force in fact to set a good example white house employees 
were informed yesterday that random drug testing would begin in 60 
days i hope the white house program will encourage increased 
testing programs in the private sector 
in addition as i mentioned earlier i have just approved a new 
set of drug abuse policy recommendations these proposals send a 
strong message to drug traffickers and illegal drug users that we 
have zero tolerance for those who sell or use illegal drugs 
for example we would require businesses and colleges that 
receive federal funds to adopt effective antidrug programs for 
pregnant women who use illegal drugs there should be priority 
treatment to help them and their unborn children we would give the 
military a greater role in coordination with our drug enforcement 
agencies 
criminals on probation or parole would be drugtested and 
testing positive might send them right back to jail and yes for 
for those who commit drugrelated murders or kill law officers we 
we favor a federal death penalty 
since 1981 when vice president george bush and i took office we 
have better than tripled total federal spending for drug 
enforcement prevention and treatment and weve requested a 
further 13 percent increase that will put nearly 4 billion into 
the federal effort next year and were beginning to see results 
arrests are up seizures are up and use in some categories is 
coming down 
but by far the most important development is the change in 
attitude in america you can feel it people are angry about 
illegal drugs were a patient people but weve lost our patience 
and this is good news because more needs to be done and as never 
before the american people are doing it in their neighborhoods 
through their churches at their schools and workplaces 
for example today 28 percent of our largest corporations have 
drug testing programs communities are working with police to get 
rid of drug dealers and in thousands of schools throughout 
american there are now just say no clubs 
i have to tell you that whole movement began when a young girl 
asked nancy what to do if someone offered her drugs and nancy told 
her just say no well i figure if young people across the 
country can come together against illegal drugs then why shouldnt 
the grownups in washington be able to do the same 
in may i proposed that both houses of congress both sides of 
the aisle join together with our administration in a bipartisan 
executivelegislative task force to advance americas unified 
antidrug policy i proposed this task force for a simple reason 
if were going to get the drugs out of our schools we need to get 
the politics out of drugs and fortunately on the drug issue there 
is near unanimous agreement i can tell you that was not the case 
seven years ago but it is today 
this is my final year in office and i believe that partisan 
bickering or seeking political advantage can only delay our 
progress in working to achieve a drugfree america 
yesterday i gave a set of policy proposals to my representatives 
to the executivelegislative task force i hope that the democratic 
leaders in congress will now join in this united effort the time 
for excuses and delays is long past i hope that through this task 
force we can all come together and work in good faith for the good 
of this country 
until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

a newly released court document more directly 
links a pratt amp whitney vice president to the pentagon fraud and 
bribery investigation than the company has previously indicated 
officials at the east hartford conn jet engine manufacturer 
have played down any alleged involvement by eugene tallia who is 
head of the companys washington office as well as a company vice 
president the officials have said that tallias name appeared on 
an fbi search warrant for the companys washington office simply 
because he is in charge of the office the associated press 
obtained a copy of the warrant last month 
but another warrant used by the fbi to search the suburban 
virginia home of a key figure in the probe melvyn r paisley 
revealed that agents were looking for notes memoranda and other 
correspondence between paisley and tallia regarding bidding 
information from pratt amp whitneys rival general electric co 
tallia was the only pratt amp whitney official named in the warrant 
pratt amp whitney is an operating unit of united technologies corp 
the document released friday by the us district court in 
alexandria va said that agents believed they would find 
documentation in paisleys mclean va home with general electric 
bidding information for the f404 engine the search warrant of the 
pratt amp whitney office sought the same documents 
the bidding information if obtained by pratt amp whitney through 
paisley during the contract competition would have given the 
connecticut company an enormous advantage over general electric 
federal investigators are looking into allegations that defense 
contractors and consultants many of them former military men 
bribed pentagon officials for contracting details that could be 
vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars 
no one has been charged in the case 
tallia and other company officials have refused to comment on 
the investigation a spokesman for united technologies said 
saturday that since the investigation is ongoing and all of the 
relevant facts arent known we simply arent in a position to 
comment further 
spokesman larry bingaman added that company officials are 
cooperating with investigators and that tallia remains in his post 
the contract to build engines for the navys f18 fighter jets 
had been held exclusively by ge but in 1984 thennavy secretary 
john f lehman decided to have the two contractors compete a move 
that paisley who was then assistant navy secretary supported 
ge and massachusetts lawmakers complained at the time about the 
dualsourcing move and lehmans decision to give pratt amp whitney a 
ge engine to help pratt build its own f404 
the navys actions followed pratt amp whitneys loss of its 
longtime monopoly on engines for the f15 and f16 fighters 
last year pratt began winning about a third of the f18 engine 
contracts union officials have charged that ges loss of some f18 
contracts cost up to 500 jobs at ges enginebuilding plant in 
lynn mass 
the newly released search warrant also reveals for the first 
time the governments belief that unidentified pratt amp whitney 
officials paid paisley during his tenure as assistant navy 
secretary in connection with information regarding another contract 
that the two companies competed for 
the document said that fbi agents sought information 
pertaining to paisleys support on behalf of pratt amp whitney for 
engines to power the v22 osprey a helicopterairplane hybrid 
designed for vertical takeoffs 
pratt amp whitney was chosen over ge to be the second contractor 
on that engine 
paisley resigned from his navy post in march 1987 and set up a 
lucrative consulting firm pratt amp whitney one of major defense 
contractors to hire paisley paid him 200000 a year to consult 
for the two engine programs according to unidentified sources 
quoted by the washington post 
tallia 52 a company vice president has headed pratt amp 
whitneys washington office since 1979 before that he worked for 
25 years at sikorsky aircraft another operating division of united 
technologies 
in related news 
attorneys for times mirror co and copley press inc have asked 
a federal court in los angeles to make public fbi affidavits 
describing evidence gathered in the fbi probe

administration 
the president lauded meeses antiterrorism efforts saying he 
worked closely with our allies to detect apprehend and prosecute

resigned i sincerely hope that you will take the initiative to 
appoint someone that can restore the dignity and the integrity to

together the type of cabinet team necessary to start the fight in 
the war on drugs 
after enumerating what he said were other shortcomings of meese

failures of this personal friend the attorney general you cannot

too politicized at the time he called on democratic and 
republican members of congress to join the executive branch on a

senate minority leader bob dole rkan and house minority 
leader robert michel rill named members of their chambers to 
the task force some time ago 
but house speaker jim wright dtexas and senate majority

attorney general edwin meese iii was closely 
involved in discussions about a proposed 1 billion iraqi oil 
pipeline and gave conflicting accounts about whether he knew of an 
alleged bribery scheme connected with the project according to an 
independent counsels report 
the sealed report portions of which were obtained by the new 
york times also calls highly unusual meeses 1985 call to the 
white house about the pipeline and reveals that a sensitive memo 
discussing financial guarantees for the project is missing from 
meeses files 
the report makes no recommendation that meese be prosecuted but 
is said to raise numerous instances of questionable conduct and to 
provide indications that meese may have known about the plan to pay 
off israels labor party to prevent israel from attacking the 
pipeline 
meese has previously said that his involvement in the pipeline 
was limited and totally lawful 
the attorney general announced last week that he will step down 
later this summer saying the report by independent counsel james 
mckay had vindicated him because it recommended no criminal 
prosecution 
in an interview aired saturday meese said he couldnt comment 
on the specifics of the document he was asked about a national 
public radio report that said that mckay concluded in another 
aspect of his investigation that meese could have been charged in 
connection with his holdings of 14000 in regional bell stock 
i think its very unfair quite frankly for anyone to leak 
information that is purportedly in a report that i cant even 
comment on meese said on the cable news network show evans 
and novak 
mckay submitted the report last week to a threejudge federal 
appeals court panel portions were also given to individuals 
mentioned in it so they could make rebuttal comments before it is 
made public 
the times published a story on the report in saturdays editions 
but did not identify its source one source speaking on condition 
of anonymity told the associated press that the portions obtained 
by the newspaper were made available to e robert wallach meeses 
former lawyer and confidant executives of the times have declined 
comment 
wallach is awaiting trial in new york on a racketeering 
indictment accusing him and two others of taking illegal payments 
from wedtech corp a bronx ny defense contracting firm to 
influence meese and other government officials 
mckay issued a statement friday saying he would seek sanctions 
against the person or persons responsible for leaking material in 
violation of a court order his office refused to elaborate further 
saturday 
wallach did not returned a reporters telephone calls his 
lawyer george walker said by telephone saturday from san 
francisco that he could not comment on the mckay report because it 
was under seal 
walker said he did not know who leaked the report but added 
if the order indicates that the document cannot be released then 
obviously mckay would have a right to request sanctions to anyone 
who did that other than that i dont want to speculate as to who 
may or may not have done it 
according to the times account meese was asked in november 1987 
by mckay about his understanding of a memorandum from wallach on 
the pipeline which was to take iraqi oil to the gulf of aqaba 
mckay asked whether meese understood when he received the memo 
in september 1985 that a portion of the pipeline funds would go 
directly to the labor party 
meese replied that he couldnt recall specifically but that 
certainly would be consistent with my understanding and would 
explain why mr thenisraeli prime minister shimon peres was 
personally interested 
however two months later meese submitted a clarification of 
his testimony saying he didnt recall that part of the memo the 
clarification came a few weeks after news accounts reported that 
the memo from wallach to meese mentioned planned payments to the 
labor party constituting a possible violation of the foreign 
corrupt practices act 
meeses lawyers nathan lewin and james rocap said meese had 
been consistent in his statements about his knowledge of the plan 
to make payments to the israeli labor party lewin said meese does 
not recall reading the portion of the memo dealing with payments to 
the political party and that is what meese meant to say when he 
gave the statement to mckay in november 1987 
mckay determined that the memo was the only direct evidence of a 
bribery plan and that the available evidence was therefore 
insufficient to conclude meeses activities violated the corrupt 
practices act israeli officials were unavailable to be questioned 
and several american witnesses invoked their right not to 
incriminate themselves 
mckay found that meese was closely involved in 1985 in 
discussions about building the pipeline mckay said the project was 
of limited interest to the us government until meese called 
robert mcfarlane then national security adviser at the white 
house to set up a meeting for wallach and swiss oilman bruce 
rappaport one of the pipeline projects partners 
it was highly unusual for a cabinet officer to request mr 
mcfarlane to meet with the cabinet officers friend about a matter 
of commercial interest to the friend the report said 
before meeses phone call the pipeline project was being 
monitored in a limited way by the national security council and 
other us agencies afterward members of the nsc staff worked 
diligently sometimes outside normal government channels to try 
and get us backing for the financial and security guarantees for 
the pipeline the times quoted the report as saying 
mckay also said a sensitive justice department memo to meese 
about the pipeline was missing from his files 
the memo dealt with a financial option pertaining to possible 
us backing for the financial and security guarantees for the 
pipeline according to the report the memo was written at 
wallachs urging by a department attorney whom wallach had 
recommended that meese hire for the position and recommended a 
possible solution to the legal problem the times reported 
the pipeline project was never built it was scuttled in 1986 by 
mcfarlanes successor john poindexter

shaken by the first schism in the roman catholic 
church in more than a century the vatican has moved with unusual 
speed to try to win back followers of renegade archbishop marcel 
lefebvre 
but it is showing no leniency for those who intend to follow the 
82yearold frenchman who consecrated four bishops without papal 
approval june 30 and was excommunicated 
lefebvre contends the vatican has broken with true catholicism 
by adopting mass in languages other than latin and by taking other 
modernist steps 
within days of lefebvres defiant act the vatican firmly stated 
that it would not tolerate lefebvre sympathizers but it made clear 
that it hoped to persuade them to be loyal to the roman catholic 
church rather than follow lefebvre out of it 
it warned that excommunication awaited those who followed 
lefebvre and the bishops he consecrated who also were 
excommunicated an excommunicated catholic cannot participate in 
the life and sacraments of the church 
pope john paul ii said catholics would be committing a grave 
offense to god by joining the archbishop and sympathizing with 
the traditionalist views of his followers the renegade movement 
claims to have millions of sympathizers worldwide but the vatican 
says only about 500000 catholics turn to lefebvres priests for 
various church functions 
in an attempt to win back lefebvres sympathizers the pope 
announced the vatican would permit wider use of the 16th century 
latin mass its suppression by the second vatican council in the 
1960s was challenged by lefebvre and his supporters 
john paul also appointed a special commission to help meet the 
spiritual and liturgical needs of lefebvres followers while 
keeping them in the mainstream church 
cardinal jeanmarie lustiger of paris acted on the popes words 
july 3 celebrating the tridentine mass in latin at notre dame 
cathedral and announcing that mass in latin would be said in three 
churches in paris each sunday 
the tridentine mass was decreed by pope pius v in 1570 and is 
used by lefebvre and his sympathizers in this mass unlike the 
socalled new mass that followed vatican ii the priest has his 
back to the congregation 
if 12 years ago the church of rome had allowed lefebvre to 
celebrate mass in latin in the pius v rite surely today we 
wouldnt have come to a schism said cardinal silvio oddi a 
conservative italian prelate 
but others view lefebvres differences with rome as going well 
beyond the mass and reflecting the tensions in the church created 
by the modernizing reforms of the 19621965 second vatican council 
lefebvre has accused the church of accepting modernism 
liberalism communism sillonism referring to a roman catholic 
movement called le sillon that was condemned by pope pius x in 
1910 for its modernist concepts lefebvre objects among other 
things to the churchs openness to other denominations and faiths 
the second vatican council formally recognized that other faiths 
have elements of truth and that their members stand in the love of 
god 
lefebvre and his followers in the st pius x fraternity see 
vatican ii as generating the cancer of liberalism in the 
church other groups have waved the flag of the council to 
challenge rome on issues ranging from papal authority to the ban on 
women becoming priests 
the vatican had offered concessions to lefebvre but the 
frenchman reneged to assure what he called the survival of 
tradition by his consecration of bishops church law allows only 
bishops to perform ordinations so lefebvre says his movement 
would be orphaned unless he acted before dying 
those who worked very hard for an agreement are very 
disappointed said a senior vatican official speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the fact that the pope a conservative himself sought 
reconciliation with the group could possibly encourage other 
groups to push for independence in a different sort of way said 
the official 
lefebvre has opened the gates to many who would say the 
progressives were right and the position of traditionalists in the 
church will be weakened 
on the other hand the schism has produced a wave of support for 
john paul whose papacy now has been scarred by the first major 
rupture in the church since the old catholics split from the 
vatican in 1870 to protest the dogma of papal infallibility decreed 
by the first vatican council 
bishops from around the world have rallied around the pope 
stressing the need for unity in a church whose history has been 
marked by division from the 11th century break with the patriarch 
of constantinople and his orthodox church to the excommunication 
of martin luther who led the protestant reformation in the 16th 
century

as new yorkers sweltered through temperatures in 
the 90s last week some of their favorite beaches were vacant 
except for a few men and women who picked through tidal debris 
the beachcombers were not looking for shells syringes blood 
vials and other waste had washed up at jones beach robert moses 
state park and other locations along 25 miles of long island shore 
the workers were enlisted to comb the closed beaches for additional 
items of waste 
although at first the debris was thought to be hospital waste 
federal and state officials concluded on friday the debris 
resembled household and boating garbage most of the beaches were 
reopened on saturday 
we dont believe this is a medical or hospitaltype washup 
william j muszynski the deputy regional administrator of the us 
environmental protection agency told the new york times 
he suggested that fears had been raised by the discovery of 145 
vials of blood a few days earlier on the shore in industrial 
bayonne nj five of the vials were contaminated with the aids 
virus a month ago five vials of blood were found farther south 
in ocean county nj 
the debris on the long island beaches focused attention on the 
issue of medicalwaste disposal commonly called redbag trash 
because of the color of the bags in which it is put to distinguish 
it from regular garbage 
those bags often contain lab waste body parts disposable 
medical supplies blood vials needles syringes intravenous 
tubing and any other material used to puncture the skin 
a 500bed hospital will spend an average of 120000 annually to 
a specially licensed carter to haul it away said kenneth raske 
president of the greater new york hospital association larger 
hospitals which treat many aids patients often pay twice as much 
carters then must take the trash to hightech incinerators 
capable of burning the waste at temperatures of more than 2000 
degrees and up and pay anywhere from 50 cents to 90 cents a pound 
to burn it 
most of these incinerators are far from the trashs point of 
origin some as far away as pennsylvania resulting in added 
trucking costs 
this state environmentalist spokesman rw groneman says is an 
invitation to the midnight dumper carters can either undercut 
their competition or raise profits by promising to abide by the 
law then dumping the refuse at sea or on land 
as we apply tighter and tighter standards on managing garbage 
were also making it more costly and as a result were getting a 
lot of illegal dumping said j winston porter epa assistant 
administrator of solid waste 
though the epa has seen isolated incidents elsewhere porter 
says its nothing like what weve seen in new york and new 
jersey which have very stringent laws concerning garbage 
in new york all potentially infectious waste must be burned in 
special incinerators outside of new york city all other medical 
waste can be buried in landfills in new york city however all 
medical waste must be burned 
if medical trash is traced back to a particular hospital they 
face fines of up to 25000 even if it was illegally dumped by the 
carter 
though new jersey laws are less definitive a bill is currently 
pending in that states legislature to monitor how hospitals and 
haulers dispose of potentially infectious waste 
porter said environmental advocates have been pushing for a 
national law committing redbag haulers and facilities to a 
cradletograve paper trail like the manifest system used in 
hauling hazardous waste 
proponents argue it would stem illegal dumping but porter said 
it would be inefficient to impose a nationwide law when its 
generally a twostate problem

the iranian airliner shot 
down a week ago was a victim of confusion that arises in modern 
regional wars about the right of passage in battle zones 
the problem led many airlines to shift routes away from the busy 
persian gulf air corridors years ago some that still fly over the 
gulf have altered their flight paths since a us warship shot the 
iran air airbus down last sunday killing all 290 people aboard 
iran air must continue flying over the gulf but its planes are 
taking routes that avoid the strait of hormuz where missiles fired 
by the cruiser uss vincennes destroyed flight 655 
it left the militarycivilian airport at bandar abbas on the 
short flight to dubai as the vincennes and uss elmer montgomery 
sank two iranian attack boats and damaged another in a skirmish in 
the narrow strait us officials said the vincennes mistook the 
airbus a300 for an iranian f14 fighter 
the particular problem is the commingling of civil traffic and 
a war zone when you put these two factors together youre 
creating a time bomb from the safety standpoint said hal ewing 
a cargo pilot who flies the gulf 
how civilian aircraft can avoid military confrontations was the 
main topic at a weekend meeting of technical experts from six major 
airlines operating passenger flights in the gulf region it was 
held at the international air transport association headquarters in 
geneva 
in their efforts to protect the sea lanes naval vessels 
sometimes disrupt those in the air 
charter pilots and journalists who monitor gulf radio traffic 
say us navy vessels often urge aircraft to leave assigned flight 
paths to avoid the warships and declare nogo areas of up to 
several miles for light aircraft 
last week the washington post quoted a dubai air controller as 
saying one such order would have put two aircraft on a collision 
course but that the jetliner told to alter its path ignored the 
order 
ewing said the navy has no legal right to order pilots off 
courses assigned by air controllers but he said if a military 
vessel warned him to change course im going to do what the 
warship tells me to do i have great respect for the air traffic 
controllers but the air traffic controllers dont control any 
missiles the warships do 
he added however for the most part its is possible to go 
out in the gulf and fly down the airways and not see any 
warships 
the cargo pilot noted that the vincennes fired when the iranian 
airliner was only minutes away pentagon officials said the ship 
detected military radar responses from the airbus but iran denies 
it carried a military transponder 
they have a difficult mission ewing said of warships trying 
to protect themselves and commercial shipping but its largely 
incompatible with the needs of civil aviation transportion in the 
region 
the khaleej times in abu dhabi said in an editorial friday that 
air traffic authorities should meet on an emergency basis and 
work out a system that lessens the strain on pilots and the 
possibility of error 
on thursday pentagon spokesman daniel howard blamed iran for 
the tragedy he said the iranian boats began the shooting 
it is not clear whether iranian air officials were aware of the 
battle in the strait below the airliners flight path diplomats 
and military observers say the speedboats sometimes appear to 
operate under local command 
the gulf a transit point for flights from europe and america to 
asia and africa is one of the worlds busiest air traffic regions 
more than 4 million passengers used dubai international airport 
last year 
flight 655 was following a route most international carriers 
abandoned years ago because of the iraniraq war which began in 
september 1980 
mansour ahmadyan deputy senior air traffic controller at dubai 
said only iran air still uses the route 
most other airlines now avoid the war zone by flying up the gulf 
around iran or bypassing the tense strait of hormuz and approaching 
dubai across the horn of land occupied by oman he said 
iran air did not announce a route change for flights from bandar 
abbas to dubai but british journalist robert fisk was on the first 
one after the sunday flight he said it took a circuitous route and 
approached dubai from the west

the expansion of us naval power in the 
persian gulf has failed to curtail attacks on merchant shipping or 
to promote negotiations to end the bloody eightyear war between 
iran and iraq 
leading members of congress are restive their concern 
heightened by the us destruction of an iranian commercial 
jetliner last sunday that killed all 290 people aboard 
the united states has unilaterally assumed the role of 
policeman in the persian gulf said sen claiborne pell dri 
chairman of the senate foreign relations committee our naval 
forces are protecting shipping in some of the worlds most 
congested waterways and under heavily trafficked skies 
the soviet union after initially calling the disaster an act 
of murder toned down its rhetoric but renewed its demand for the 
immediate withdrawal of the 18 us ships that now patrol the gulf 
with license to open fire on iranian planes and helicopters that 
threaten 11 reflagged kuwaiti tankers or any other neutral shipping 
a number of arab countries normally hostile to iran have 
condemned the downing of the plane despite us assurances that it 
was an accident 
president reagan has persisted in defining as his main aim in 
the gulf protecting the right of navigation in international 
waters and his policy has the support of a number of allies and 
prominent americans 
i happen to think its correct said zbigniew brzezinski 
who was president jimmy carters national security adviser its 
designed to keep the russians out and to keep the iranians from 
winning thats the purpose of the policy and that has not been 
altered by the tragedy 
the 18 us ships keeping an eye on the 77 million barrels a 
day of oil that pass through the tense strait of hormuz are backed 
up by the carrier forrestal and seven other american vessels 
including the cruiser vincennes which shot down the iranian airbus 
the navy has fired on iranian helicopters and destroyed oil 
installations and been the victim of collisions with mines and a 
tragedy second in scope only to the airbus disaster the may 17 
1987 misdirected attack by an iraqi war plane that killed 37 
american sailors aboard the us frigate stark 
ironically the us navys presence tilts in iraqs favor even 
though the reagan administrations stated policy is one of 
neutrality between the gulf combatants by protecting the kuwaiti 
and other merchant ships the united states seeks to curb irans 
ability to conduct a tanker war as a pressure tactic against 
iraq and its arab allies 
in the meantime tehran has not bowed to us demands that it 
enter negotiations and attacks on ships in the volatile gulf region 
have increased 
according to the center for defense information a private 
research group there have been 184 attacks on commercial vessels 
in the area since last july 22 when the first convoy of kuwaiti 
tankers carrying us flags moved through the gulf iran carried 
out 104 of the attacks and iraq 80 brian mccarten of the center 
said 
over the same period a year earlier there were 115 attacks 52 
by the iranians and 63 by the iraqis 
sen pell urged consideration of a un naval peacekeeping 
force to protect nonbelligerent shipping in the gulf it could 
enhance gulf security while reducing risk of future tragedies 
pell said 
the proposal has the endorsement of cyrus r vance secretary of 
state in the carter administration and elliot richardson a former 
undersecretary 
another former undersecretary of state george w ball called 
the reflagging of kuwaiti tankers an example of the vice of 
unilateralism and said the reagan administration should have 
accepted a soviet proposal for a un naval forces 
the proposal was rejected and now we see the consequences of 
that ball said by telephone from princeton nj 
sen brock adams dwash a member of the foreign relations 
committee suggested a varied approach he said in an interview 
friday us ships should protect american merchant vessels british 
warships protect their nations cargoes and so on 
what weve had is a great escalation and we only get 10 
percent of our oil from the gulf and a tilt toward iraq adams 
said 
with the us navy admittedly in a combat zone adams said the 
reagan administration should formally invoke the war powers act 
giving congress the power to decide whether the warships should 
remain there 
this concern was clearly heightened by the downing of the 
iranian jetliner but even last november the staff of the senate 
foreign relations committee warned the united states seriously 
risks being drawn into war in the persian gulf although the stated 
purpose of the large american fleet in the region is narrowly 
defined to escort usflagged vessels through the gulf this 
mission given the circumstances is dangerously nebulous 
on the diplomatic front a year ago secretary of state george p 
shultz led a successful drive in the united nations security 
council for adoption of a ceasefire resolution 
but he has failed to persuade the soviet union or china to 
promise not to use their veto powers to block a followup 
resolution to impose an arms embargo against iran for refusing to 
negotiate with iraq 
as a result the ceasefire resolution is an empty statement of 
principle 
iran has sent a number of probes to the administration and 
in the wake of last sundays disaster the white house and state 
department revealed american entreaties to tehran to talk about 
ending the war and freeing the nine american hostages in lebanon 
held by proiranian forces 
sen richard lugar rind a member of the foreign relations 
committee said the united states should now take advantage of 
whatever diplomatic opportunities the situation may present 
ironically this is the kind of event that may offer some 
possibilities for a push toward settlement he said on cnns 
newsmaker saturday program 
iranian deputy foreign minister mohammed javad larijani sent a 
message last april through un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar expressing hopes for a meeting but the state department 
was unable to confirm that the probes were authoritative and 
had the support of the entire iranian government 
reagans message last sunday of deep regret contained an 
offer to work jointly to end the war so far tehran has not 
replied

eastern airlines union leaders say a new safety 
agreement with the carrier could be a sign of progress but add 
that tense labormanagement relations will improve more if the high 
number of firings and suspensions is reduced 
weve had five terminations this week so nothing has 
abated said nancy currier a vice president of the transport 
workers union local representing 7000 flight attendants the rate 
of firings is far higher than it was last year and far higher 
than it was before frank lorenzo 
it would be one of the most meaningful areas for improvement 
lorenzos texas air corp took over eastern more than two years 
ago inheriting some 25 billion in debts and a recent history of 
labormanagement conflict 
at the district office of the machinists union easterns 
largest with 12000 mechanics baggage handlers and ramp workers 
union officials keep detailed charts tracing the steady rise of 
disciplinary measures particularly firings since the takeover 
our big concern is the unjust terminations lorenzo talks 
about mending fences but i dont think the word has filtered down 
to his frontline management who keep burning bridges said rick 
iacino a machinists general chairman 
eastern spokesman robin matell said eastern wouldnt comment on 
the safety agreement announced wednesday in washington beyond a 
statement from president phil bakes 
while bakes praised the agreement as important to separating 
safety from other issues he said a missing link remains until 
contract negotiations are completed with the machinists who have 
been in federal mediation for seven months and the pilots with 
whom talks started about a month ago 
former labor secretary william brock who brought the two sides 
together in washington said battling between eastern management 
and its union leadership threatens the carriers survival 
it is the commitment of labor and management leaders which 
will make or break this effort brock said frankly this 
presents some cause for concern 
all observers have said when looking at this that theyve 
never seen anything this severe and such shrill treatment between 
management and labor maybe going back to the 40s and the coal 
miners said veteran machinists leader charles e bryan 
the agreement calls for more outside impartial scrutiny 
increased communications between labor and management and promises 
no reprisals against employees who point out safety problems 
the machinists claim that employees who balked at hurryup work 
have been disciplined in addition workers have been fired for 
insubordination refusing to work excessive overtime or for union 
activities 
the machinists union has had 41 shop stewards fired in the last 
two years this year 129 machinists have been fired so far 
compared to 157 in the first six months of 1987 the union says 
the machinists say they have fared well in grievances winning 
back pay and reinstatement in a majority of cases but the 
grievance procedures are backlogged more than a year they say 
the air line pilots association representing 3500 eastern 
pilots has had a different problem many of its pilots have gone 
to other airlines or left the industry entirely because of 
easterns tense situation and uncertain future 
pilots spokesman jb stokes said nearly 1000 pilots will have 
left eastern since 1986 by the end of this summer according to 
projections 
youre talking about 25 percent without the pilots these 
planes are taco stands stokes said 
pilots last year launched a maxsafety program in which they 
highlighted alleged safety laxity and took their complaints into 
congressional hearings 
eastern has said toughened absenteeism policies and increased 
discipline are part of efforts to correct years of worker abuses 
that have driven up costs management has indicated it still 
believes cuts in labor costs are essential 
this spring federal officials conducted special inspections of 
aircraft flown by eastern and continental airlines another texas 
air subsidiary they also examined texas airs management and 
finances 
they said that they found no unsafe conditions but warned of 
possible safety problems because of the labormanagement battles

here is the text of the weekly democratic 
response to president reagans radio address given by rep charles 
b rangel dny 
im representative charles rangel chairman of the house select 
committee on narcotic abuse and control 
mr president now that ed meese has finally resigned as acting 
attorney general you now have the opportunity to appoint a person 
that can restore the dignity and integrity that the office 
rightfully deserves 
ed meese not only let you down as a personal friend mr 
president but when you made him your personal coordinator in the 
war against drugs there was no strategy there was no policy in 
short there was no war 
you appointed ed meese to head up your drug policy abuse board 
composed of your highest ranking cabinet officials and yet mr 
president he let us down with every major drugproducing country 
having bumper crops year after year mr meese has never been able 
to persuade our secretary of state to even place drugs on our 
foreign policy agenda 
on the middle east communism terrorism arm controls weve 
all heard the eloquence of our outspoken secretary of state but 
even today weve yet to hear one word from secretary of state 
george shultz on narcotics control as we see drugtraffickers 
assassinate international leaders plunder and corrupt governments 
and even hold fragile democracies in our own hemisphere hostage 
even when you mr president admitted that narcotic abuse and 
trafficking was a threat to our national security it wasnt enough 
to get former secretary of defense weinberger or now secretary 
carlucci to pitch in and lend their support with the multitrillion 
dollar technology weve invested in our military to back up and to 
support our border patrol our coast guard and customs officials 
surely mr president the protection of our borders and shores 
against the intrusion of this deadly epidemiccausing poison 
warrants the support of our sophisticated military leadership mr 
president mr meese and your drug policy board has never been able 
to get secretary bennett secretary of education bennett to get 
beyond just saying no no to preventive program no to 
educational programs and even no to our local and state 
governments as we try to give assistance to formulate their own 
programs 
today we have no health programs designed for drug abusers from 
the secretary of health and human services we dont have any 
health policy that encourages research and treatment modalities to 
share with private and public health providers and throughout 
these great united states in this possession we dont even have 
one federal rehabilitation center to serve as a model for our 
nation 
as mr meese was conducting a war against drugs mr president 
he certainly needed more than a drug enforcement agency that 
although these are hardworking dedicated agents that we only have 
2800 agents to cover the entire united states and the foreign 
countries that allow their presence 
mr president the local and state law enforcement officials 
know that the federal government cant do this job alone they have 
been in the trenches for nearly eight years outnumbered outarmed 
but always on the job but theyve never been invited as fulltime 
partners in this socalled war against drugs 
every budget that has been projected by the congress to provide 
for federal assistance to these dedicated officials have been 
rejected or resisted by you mr president your office of 
management and budget and yes your attorney general now mr 
president even after sevenandahalf years we can start anew 
you can now appoint an attorney general that will work with the 
congress and to help us to prepare legislation that can truly make 
a national war against drugs and that can make all americans 
proud the evermounting increase of narcotics thats entering our 
classrooms and even our boardrooms indicate that this is not a 
local issue and certainly it cant be considered a democratic or 
republican issue 
let us know mr president now that as late as it is we can 
appoint an attorney general that will work with speaker jim wright 
and his bipartisan house legislative team headed by democratic 
majority leader tom foley and republican minority leader bob 
michels that can fashion a bill and a policy that makes some sense 
for those of us that are faint at heart and who believe that we can 
win this war by legalizing drugs let them be on notice mr 
president that this battle can and shall be won we cant do it 
just by slogans 
we cant do it by throwing up our hands in frustration and 
despair but we can begin to get started by stop blaming each other 
and coming together and working together in a joint effort with 
your new attorney general we can start a new relationship the 
congress cant do this job alone its not too late for us together 
to provide the resources the programs but most of all mr 
president the leadership to get the job done 
thank you

the communist party restored nikolai i bukharins 
membership saturday completing the rehabilitation of lenins old 
comrade 50 years after josef stalin had him shot as a spy for 
opposing the dictators policies 
retrieving bukharins memory from disgrace is part of the effort 
by mikhail s gorbachev to clear the names of dozens of people who 
became stalins victims after helping lead the 1917 bolshevik 
revolution and form the soviet state 
tass the official news agency said the party control committee 
of the policymaking central committee readmitted bukharin another 
old bolshevik alexei i rykov and 14 other people 
millions of soviet citizens heard the announcement on state 
televisions evening news program 
the rehabilitations began feb 4 when the supreme court cleared 
bukharin and the others of the charges for which they were executed 
or imprisoned many articles examining bukharin and his policies 
have appeared in the soviet press 
in bukharins case rehabilitation has special significance 
because it implies endorsement of his opposition to the harsh 
policies with which stalin forced the industrialization of the 
soviet union and the collectivization of agriculture 
it answers an emotional plea he made for rehabilitation before 
he was shot in 1938 in it he said know comrades that on the 
banner which you will carry in your victorious march to communism 
there is a drop of my blood 
bukharin also incurred stalins displeasure by advocating a 
greater role for voluntary work cooperatives more individual 
enterprise and other policies resembling reforms gorbachev has 
promoted 
gorbachev noted in a speech nov 2 however that lenin regarded 
bukharin as not fully marxist and said rapid develolpment of 
soviet industry and agriculture had been necessary 
saturdays announcement praised bukharin and rykov for helping 
build communism it said they took dissenting positions in the 
determination of courses and methods of socialist construction 
but added that the mistakes and dissenting positions are not of 
an antiparty character 
since gaining power in march 1985 gorbachev has attacked stalin 
for his cult of personality tried to dismantle much of the 
central bureaucratic structure stalin built and acknowledged that 
innocent people suffered under the dictators terror 
in the november speech he announced a resumption of the effort 
begun by nikita s khrushchev 30 years ago to rehabilitate the 
millions of victims 
he told the communist party conference july 1 in a reference to 
stalins purges that it is important to restore justice with 
regard to the victims of lawlessness and it is the partys 
political and moral duty to do so he endorsed building a 
monument to stalins victims in moscow 
tass said the control committee restored the party memberships 
june 21 but the agency did not explain why the action was not 
announced for more than two weeks 
bukharin rykov and stalin were allies in 1926 two years after 
lenins death in the power struggle with leon trotsky 
two years later with stalin firmly in control bukharin and 
rykov were branded leaders of a rightist deviation in the party 
and bukharin was labeled a falsifier of marxism they were 
stripped of their party posts in the ensuing years 
on june 13 the soviet supreme court reversed the convictions of 
three other bolsheviks who perished under stalin lev kamenev 
gregory zinoviev and karl radek 
trotsky has not been rehabilitated 
he was accused of leading an antisoviet plot and murdered in 
mexico city in 1940 apparently on stalins orders on june 17 
soviet historian yuri n afanasyev suggested trotsky be exonerated 
of criminal charges and his writings be published in the soviet 
union

a portuguese newspaper reported saturday 
that 2000 cuban troops have been sent to angola to bolster 
government defenses near the border with namibia 
the independent weekly expresso quoted unidentified reliable 
sources as saying the cubans described as experts in mounting and 
firing missiles landed in the former portuguese colony in june 
the newspaper said the reinforcements were sent to strengthen 
the position of the marxist angolan government and cuba in 
negotiations with south africa and the united states to end the 
13year civil war in angola 
the reinforcements arrived shortly before a second round of 
peace negotiations between the four countries in cairo egypt the 
newspaper said lower level delegations scheduled more talks monday 
and tuesday in new york 
in a separate story expresso quoted unidentified diplomatic 
sources in havana as saying cuban forces had mounted a defensive 
line involving 26000 men in the south of angola close to south 
africanadministered namibia also known as southwest africa 
angola and cuba have acknowledged that cuba began sending 
reinforcements of elite troops to angola in november to help the 
35000 cuban soldiers already stationed there contain south african 
advances in the south 
western analysts believe those reinforcements brought the number 
of cubans in angola to about 46000 
expresso claimed the cuban reinforcements were creating 
differences between the angolan government and cuba 
last week jorge risquet the chief cuban negotiator at the 
peace talks strongly denied any rift he told a news conference in 
lisbon all military decisions were made by the angolan government 
south african troops in angola support guerrillas of the 
national union for the total independence of angola also backed by 
the united states who have been fighting since 1975 to force the 
soviet and cubansupported government to share power 
a peace settlement turns on securing a withdrawal of foreign 
troops from angola and implementing a un resolution to make 
namibia independent

the closing of a lockheed aircraft corp 
plant will end one of the few successful efforts by a major 
employer to create jobs in the impoverished watts neighborhood 
following the 1965 riots 
the wattswillowbrook plant which makes parts for the c5 cargo 
plane will close by october when work on the c5 is completed the 
company said friday the plant is on the citys south side about 8 
miles from downtown 
of the plants 117 workers 78 have enough seniority to qualify 
for transfers to the companys burbank plant about 20 miles away 
lockheed said it will attempt to find employment for the rest with 
other aerospace firms 
a lockheed spokesman said the company had expected to use the 
plant for other work after the completion of the c5 program but 
lockheeds aircraft business has been dwindling and no suitable 
projects could be found 
we had hoped that lockheed would be able to feed more work to 
wattswillowbrook said mark molli an aide to us rep augustus 
f hawkins dcalif we want to see that the workers are taken 
care of 
former lockheed president a carl kotchian recalled in a recent 
interview that the companys decision to open the plant four years 
after the devastating riot was considered controversial 
i had my own people take issue with me kotchian said 
they said i was going to spend a lot of money and the place was 
going to be run down and there was going to be thievery and 
muggings at the plant none of it came to pass 
instead the plant matched the productivity and efficiency of 
most lockheed factories he said 
the arrest of a black man by a state highway patrol officer on 
aug 11 1965 touched off a week of rioting that turned watts into 
a national symbol of racial strife 
thirtyfour people died in the riot and 4000 people were

the oppositions strong showing in 
presidential elections marks a watershed in mexican politics a 
transition from 59 years of a oneparty system and the awakening of 
a long passive electorate political analysts say 
early returns indicated that carlos salinas de gortari 
candidate of the governing institutional revolutionary party would 
finish with no more than 52 percent of the vote party officials 
say that is far below the 70 percent the party had considered the 
minimum 
the pri has not lost a presidential gubernatorial or senate 
race since it was founded in 1929 partial returns have shown 
salinas leading with 478 percent of the vote 
pri officials appeared willing to concede that cuauhtemoc 
cardenas of the leftist national democratic front and manuel j 
clouthier of the conservative national action party would finish 
better than original polls indicated 
pri sources who spoke on condition of anonymity conceded 
salinas had likely lost in michoacan the federal district and 
adjoining morelos state and probably in the state of mexico the 
mexico city metropolitan area accounts for about 20 percent of the 
38 million registered voters 
cardenas and clouthiers parties said salinas lost and they 
claimed widespread fraud 
the voter turnout and final results were not expected until 
sunday but partial results were leaked in an attempt to defuse 
allegations of manipulation of the vote 
salinas insisted on a small but credible margin of victory 
rather than the frequently fraudtainted results the party is known 
for but the almost certain loss of congressional seats and the 
opposition entry into the senate for the first time is hard for the 
partys old guard 
psychologically it means a big blow adolfo aguilar a 
mexican economist with the carnegie endowment for peace said 
politically just imagine the slice of people they have to cut 
this chunk of votes means many pri candidates its going to be 
disastrous for the pri 
political analyst jorge castaneda said cardenas did much better 
than expected particularly in urban areas 
salinas who has said he wants to modernize mexico will owe his 
vote to the poorest most backward peasantry of the country 
castaneda said 
in a victory proclamation before any results were released 
salinas acknowledged the opposition would have more congressional 
representation than in the past and said the times of virtually 
having a single party are over and we now enter a new political 
stage in the countrys life with a majority party and a very 
intense competition by the opposition 
clearcut opposition from both the left united for the first 
time and the right swept away decades of apathy and voters turned 
out in what officials say were record numbers 
young people turned out not just to vote but also as polling 
place officials to protect the cleanliness of the election jorge 
bustamente director of the northern border college in tijuana 
said 
the country is changing very broad sectors went to vote 
even though they knew there would be the traditional fraud 
something that kept them away in the past luis javier garrido a 
political analyst who wrote a book on the pri said they went to 
vote for another system 
lorenzo meyer academic director of the colegio de mexico a 
think tank and graduate school said the change was long in coming 
from 1940 to 1988 you cant see many political changes he 
said but in the same half century mexico evolved from a sparsely 
inhabited rural country whose people had little education to a 
fastgrowing urban nation with schools and well developed 
communications 
a pri official says the answer in the salinas administration 
will be to play by clean rules and on economic issues you 
deliver 
castaneda reflecting a view expressed by others said the 
election means the end of the oneparty system and also the end 
of a situation where the government could do what it wanted 
but garrido said he believed the pris assurance of a majority 
in the chamber of deputies and senate would keep the opposition 
from influencing the government and still allow salinas to carry 
out his programs 
i dont think it necessarily means more pluralism he said 
he said that would come when there is the oppositions same right 
to govern is recognized 
others interviewed said salinas would have to take the 
opposition into consideration and negotiate 
much also will depend on the credibility of the final election 
tally and the elections themselves 
a critical factor will be whether the longsplintered lefts 
fragile unity for the campaign continues after the election 
cardenas has emerged as the leader the left lacked 
its him or nobody meyer said but he warned 
consolidating it the left in a party is a formidable task

pope john paul ii on saturday appointed an 
eightmember commission to seek ways to persuade followers of 
excommunicated archbishop marcel lefebvre to remain loyal to the 
roman catholic church 
the pope warned on july 2 that lefebvre sympathizers will be 
excommunicated if they remain with the rebel prelate but john paul 
also promised to try to meet their traditionalist needs including 
mass said in latin if they follow the pope 
lefebvre created the first church schism in 118 years when he 
consecrated four traditionalist bishops on june 30 without papal 
permission the act caused the automatic excommunication of the 
five as well as of monsignor antonio de castro mayer a brazilian 
prelate who assisted lefebvre in the ceremony 
john paul said the special vatican commission will seek to 
preserve the spiritual and liturgical traditions of lefebvre 
followers such as the 16th century tridentine mass in latin 
lefebvre and his followers reject many modernizing reforms of 
the 19621965 second vatican council including the replacement of 
the latin mass with a simplified liturgy in the local language 
the 82yearold french prelates defiant act has produced the 
first major rupture in the church since the old catholics split 
from the vatican in 1870 to protest the dogma of papal 
infallibility decreed by the first vatican council 
the commission will be headed by west german cardinal paul 
augustin mayer who until recently was prefect of the vaticans 
congregation for the sacraments and of the congregation for the 
divine cult 
other commission members are monsignor tere tena garriga 
undersecretary of the congregation for the divine cult monsignor 
milan simcic of the congregation for the clergy monsignor jesus 
torres llorente of the congregation for the religious tarcisio 
bertone an expert in canon law monsignor frantisek rypar of the 
congregation for catholic education benedictine theologian benoit

five months after two american indians took 
hostages at a newspaper to protest local conditions changes have 
been made to address their concerns but some say it remains to be 
seen whether the reforms will bring lasting change 
others say the real change is that residents of robeson county 
have realized that they can control their lives 
its truly cosmetic eddie hatcher said last week of the 
changes which include a second superior court judgeship and a task 
force named by gov jim martin to investigate alleged corruption in 
the county 
its nothing more than to douse the fire hoping it will go 
out said hatcher one of two lumbee indian men who entered the 
offices of the robesonian newspaper feb 1 allegedly armed in 
what they said was a protest of local corruption and discrimination 
against minorities the daylong siege ended when the governor 
agreed to appoint the task force 
the countys population of about 100000 is 37 percent indian 
37 percent white and 26 percent black 
the rev mac legerton executive director of the center for 
community action also was cautious 
the policy changes which have occurred relate to the 
administration of the law he said hopefully these changes 
will provide better treatment under the law but they will not 
ensure justice throughout robeson county 
other residents were more optimistic 
from my point of view we got the second judgeship and were 
going to get a public defender said harvey godwin a lumbee 
community leader who led julian pierces campaign for superior 
court judge 
thats pretty good godwin said but were making sure 
that people dont forget and dont let up were taking care of 
business 
pierce a lumbee who was running against district attorney joe 
freeman britt for robeson countys superior court judgeship was 
shot to death in march in what initially was called an 
assassination but was later termed a domestic dispute that left 
the post to britt who has sent more people to death row than any 
other prosecutor in the nation 
after it became apparent that the judgeship would go to britt 
the state agreed to create a second judgeship which would go to a 
member of a minority group 
hatcher said the second judgeship was just to appease the 
people of robeson county hoping that the people will die down 
because britt is expected to be the countys senior judge he 
will be able to set the judicial calendar pick a magistrate 
and set the bailbond policy hatcher said what have we 
gained nothing 
but hatcher said real change has come in the minds of lumbee 
indians and blacks 
the people have seen changes in themselves because they have 
realized that they can control their lives he said 
now its not just me and fellow accused hostagetaker timothy 
jacobs speaking out hatcher said now its the poor farmer 
its the grassroots people theyre realizing they can do 
something theyre unaccustomed to politically fighting back but 
theyre beginning to 
he cited a referendum vote to unite the countys fiveschool 
system that passed by a razorthin margin this spring supporters 
say it will lessen economic and educational disparities among 
schools in the system and foster a sense of common purpose 
godwin agreed that many people in robeson county who previously 
have felt powerless now feel differently 
people are angry but the point is they realize that they can 
do something about it he said i think people are going to 
take advantage of that especially the younger people 
it used to be we were just lost said georgeanna chavis 66 
now it seems that we are coming out 
mrs chavis also said she thought whites have treated her better 
in recent months 
maybe they feel that were trying to pull ourselves out of 
where we were she said its like white people are saying we 
dont see why they waited so long 
would those changes have come about without the protest hatcher 
and jacobs staged 
i think they certainly can be given credit said the rev 
joy johnson a leader of concerned citizens and vicechairman of 
the countys humanrelations commission we dont approve of 
their means but i think they gave us the impetus for change in 
robeson county

the governing nationalist party began 
saturday to partially dismantle its oldguard leadership but it 
has yet to decide how much new blood to inject into its top ranks 
the party removed 10 of the 31 members of the policymaking 
central standing committee including five who are in their 80s 
the 10 were named to the central advisory committee an honorary 
supervisory group of mostly retired officials 
nationalist leaders have stressed the importance of promoting 
younger members of the party known as the kuomingtang which was 
formed 94 years ago on the chinese mainland and has for four 
decades claimed to be the sole rightful ruler of china 
party spokesman raymond tai told reporters that the new central 
standing committee will be named thursday at the end of the 
weeklong 13th party congress a cabinet overhaul is expected later 
most of the aging leaders in the current central standing 
committee whose members average age is 70 fled to taiwan from 
the chinese mainland in 1949 when chiang kaishek and his 
nationalist government were routed by the communists 
these older nationalists still hold a majority of seats in the 
parliament and support the partys claim that it has the right to 
govern china 
the personnel changes are likely to determine the pace for 
continuing the liberalization program started by president chiang 
chingkuo before his death in january chiang the eldest son of 
chiang kaishek lifted martial law allowed new political parties 
and eased a ban on travel to mainland china 
president lee tenghui who friday was elected the first native 
taiwanese party chairman has vowed to continue the democratic 
changes but he has moved cautiously in the past months in order to 
consolidate his power 
the new members of the advisory committee were proposed by lee 
and approved by the party congress 
three media executives on the central standing committee who 
have said they want to give way to a younger leadership also were 
named to the advisory panel 
but two influential 74yearold conservatives on the 
policymaking committee premier yu kuohwa and shen changhuan 
secretary to the president were not reassigned 
the independence evening post newspaper said saturday that yu 
and four other elder statesmen will remain a major force as the 
old generals lead the team while the young officials intern

with the first lady out of town and the 
president looking for a good time invitations went out to some of 
the best storytellers on capitol hill for an evening of yarn 
swapping at the white house 
he just wanted to have the boys come in have dinner and have 
a bull session alabama sen howell heflin said saturday most 
of it was just levity and jokes it was just sort of a night out 
with the boys 
mrs reagan was in new york to meet with her publisher random 
house about plans to write her memoirs 
democrat heflin was one of six legislators who shared their best 
stories with president reagan during a fourhour session friday 
night in the presidents private quarters at the white house 
and what were some of those best stories 
thats one thing theres a pledge of secrecy on heflin 
said at least on the stories he might have told anyway 
there were a lot of good ones but theyre all super secret 
heflin said he told reagan his story about expectations 
where the elderly lady after striking up a conversation on an 
airplane with an elderly gentleman pats him on the knee and tells 
him he reminds her of her third husband 
the man said oh is that right and how many times have you 
been married and she replied twice heflin said 
the evenings conversation drifted into serious discussion only 
rarely according to heflin once was when rep dan rostenkowski 
dill asked reagan what he would most like to see his successor 
accomplish 
he said he would like to see him push forward and adopt a 
constitutional amendment to balance the budget and also to get a 
line item veto heflin said and then we discussed those 
aspects of fiscal responsibility 
on another occasion heflin said reagan told the group about 
some of his discussions with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
during the moscow summit in may 
reagan also talked at length about his early days in the movies 
heflin said and at one point he described all the considerations 
and ethics boards and everything that had to be cleared before 
rhett butler played by clark gable could use the word damn in 
the closing scene of gone with the wind 
he was in effect decrying the ways movies have changed 
heflin said he talked about how the movies used to have a power 
of suggestion that the mind worked on and now there is so much 
activity that it leaves nothing for the mind to imagine 
in addition to heflin and rostenkowski others invited to the 
friday evening session with the president were sen alan simpson 
rwyo rep robert michel rill rep gene taylor rmo rep 
marvin leath dtexas and kenneth duberstein the white house

portauprince haiti ap critics said saturday that lt gen 
henri namphys decision to discard the constitution approved 15 
months ago demonstrates that the army has no intention of returning 
the country to democracy 
the army is sick of this talk of democracy the truth is they 
dont want elections said paul latortue a former senatorial 
candidate in haiti who lives in exile in puerto rico 
namphy said friday night on state television that the existing 
constitution included elements foreign to haitian tradition and 
was unhappily written and ratified in a climate of passion and 
emotion he said a new constitution would be written taking 
haitian reality into account 
we are experiencing a catastrophe said louis roy coauthor 
of the constitution and its most prominent defender the entire 
army and its commanderinchief namphy have committed perjury 
they swore allegiance to the constitution a year ago in spite of 
the faults that they find in it now 
in a june 19 coup namphy ousted president leslie manigat a 
political science professor who was elected four months earlier and 
is now in exile 
namphy ruled haiti between the fall of dictator jeanclaude 
duvalier in february 1986 and manigats inauguration two years 
later the military officer repeatedly pledged to respect the 
constitution approved by 99 percent of haitians in a march 1987 
referendum 
among the guests invited to listen to namphys speech friday at 
his palace in portauprince were former presidential candidates 
gerard phillipeauguste who was manigats agriculture minister 
and gregoire eugene now namphys adviser on constitutional law 
also present were two former duvalier aides claude raymond and 
clovis desinor and the entire army high command including col 
jeanclaude paul recently indicted in miami on charges of drug 
trafficking 
it was a comic and pathetic gathering friday night at the 
palace said jeanclaude bajeux a prominent opposition leader 
a gang of dinosaurs have emerged from their caves to reassure 
each other that their treasure would not be threatened by several 
million human beings on the way to the polls to vote said bajeux 
in january manigat was declared the winner of armyorganized 
elections boycotted by most haitians 
when asked to comment on namphys allegation that the 
constitution was inspired by foreign ideas and was contrary to 
haitian tradition latortue said he is saying returning exiles 
bring undersirable ideas of change i think namphy regretted the 
decision to open the door to exiles after duvalier left 
meanwhile at the end of a fourday summit of caribbean community 
leaders in antigua trinidadtobago prime minister anr robinson 
criticized the organization for not condemning namphy 
i have no doubt whatsoever from the history of gen namphy 
that he has no commitment to the democratic process robinson 
said 
streets were quiet in portauprince on saturday and business 
and public transportation functioned normally 
it is obviously illusory to think of the full enjoyment of 
rights and liberties in the context of absolute poverty in which 
nearly 70 percent of the population is vegetating namphy 
said in his speech 
but he said his government would respect freedom of speech and 
assembly and the right to participate in labor unions and political 
parties 
latortue said namphys action pushes haiti even farther away 
from democratic rule the army and the duvalierists never liked 
the constitution they want an authoritarian regime i see the path 
to democracy as blocked he said 
the army has directly or indirectly ruled this impoverished 
caribbean nation for most of its 184year history

defense secretary frank carlucci called 
saturday for stable congressional funding to discourage military 
contractors from seeking shortterm profits and political advantage 
carlucci said a lack of such funding provides incentives for 
contractors to neglect longterm investment to try to influence 
funding decisions by the pentagon and congress and to gain 
information about contract awards through consultants 
carlucci said the cumbersome and complex defense procurement 
system provides too many chances for congressional 
micromanagement and influence by special advocates 
that system has led contractors to look for shortterm 
advantages both financially and politically he told the 
philadelphia world affairs council 
and the best way for contractors to do that in our current 
system is to invest in market intelligence a euphemism for 
hiring consultants and lobbyists to intervene in the process in the 
executive branch and on capitol hill carlucci said 
multiyear budgeting longterm contracts freezing weapons 
design simplifying requirements contracting to performance all 
of these techniques can be used to streamline the process and 
strengthen the hand of the program manager while weakening the 
influence of the special advocates he added 
carlucci who would not answer questions from reporters after 
his speech said he was disturbed by the allegations raised by a 
justice department investigation that military contractors and 
consultants had bribed pentagon officials no one has been charged 
in the case 
as soon as information becomes available to us from the 
justice department we will act promptly to review contracts and 
take appropriate suspension debarment and termination actions as 
we have already done he said

an insurance company faces revocation of 
its license in minnesota if it refuses to issue droughtinsurance 
policies to about 1000 farmers who paid for more than 40 million 
in coverage a state official says 
minnesota commerce commissioner michael hatch said friday that 
new jerseybased chubb insurance cos informed farmers who paid for 
the policies by a june 15 deadline that the policies will not be 
issued 
but under a 1987 state law once an insurance agent accepts and 
cashes a check from a farmer the policy cannot be canceled by 
either party hatch said all checks were cashed by june 15 hatch 
said 
weve told the company that we want the policies issued 
hatch said were saying if you dont issue the policies well 
ask the attorney generals office to prepare documents to revoke 
the companys license to do business in minnesota 
hatch said a meeting is scheduled monday between state officials 
and company representatives 
company officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment 
chubb had told minnesota insurance agents that the sales should 
be canceled and premiums refunded to buyers hatch said the 
company explained that sales exceeded its capacity 
hatch said chubb was remiss for deciding halfway through a 
droughtstricken summer to refund premiums on drought coverage 
when the issue first arose last week chubb contended that it 
had taken applications that didnt translate into coverage until it 
approved them some of the applications contain such a statement 
and others dont hatch said 
the insurance would begin paying buyers a percentage of the full 
amount if rainfall fell below 70 percent of normal at the nearest 
official rain gauge during june july and august the lower the 
rainfall the higher the amount paid

youve got to have art and it shouldnt be 
confused with pornography a kenosha woman contends 
so she is challenging an obscenity law in hopes of helping other 
artists after she was forced to put her wooden sculpture of a nude 
man and woman under wraps 
marta brewer 31 filed a suit last week in us district court 
here asking the court to declare unconstitutional a kenosha 
ordinance because it infringes on her first amendment rights to 
free expression 
the reason i filed the suit was partly for myself and partly 
for all the artists who im sure dont appreciate censorship 
brewer said 
eunice z edgar executive director of the wisconsin civil 
liberties union said the ordinance wrongly places brewers 
sculpture in the same category as hardcore pornography 
brewer displayed the lifesize sculptures with some of her oil 
paintings in may in front of her home police said the sculpture of 
the nude figures has movable joints and can assume a sexual 
position and thus violated the ordinance barring the public display 
of explicit sexual material 
although she conceded that the figures can assume a sexual 
position brewer said smut was not the main focus of the work and 
that the figures never were displayed in a sexual position

rooming house early saturday killing three people and seriously 
burning another and a rash of smaller fires was reported across

going from fire to fire as flames broke out in 10 separate places 
in garbage bins brush along fence lines and in an apartment 
building 20 blocks from the destroyed rooming house only minor 
damage was reported in those fires 
john fifer assistant fire chief in this southcentral 
washington town of 18000 said a state fire marshal had been 
called in to determine whether the fatal fire was linked to the 
others which he said were probably arson 
we are presuming those others are all set fires he said 
there have been no arrests officials said 
the state investigator was on the scene saturday afternoon said 
firefighter dennis morris but he and others said they did not want 
to be too quick to label the fatal fire as arson before they had 
ruled out other possible causes 
you can always say arson but that is a pretty easy way out 
morris said 
the dead were tentatively identified but authorities were 
withholding their names pending positive identification and 
notification of relatives all three victims were males fifer said 
the manager of the destroyed building godfrey davis said he 
discovered the fire at 345 am as he got up to go to work 
when i opened the door it seemed like all hell was busting 
loose davis said it knocked me back so then i started 
hollering get everybody out there its a fire 
one of the victims was a double amputee who called down the 
stairs from the second floor that he couldnt find his artificial 
legs in the smoke davis said he said he told the frightened man 
to jump but he wouldnt 
morris said the rubble from the rooming house was searched and 
no other victims were found there were reportedly 20 to 25 people 
in the twostory building when the fire hit 
davis said it seemed to him that the fire had begun outside the 
building but fire officials said they had not determined where it 
began 
the fires at the apartment building 20 blocks away were set in a 
garbage can and a laundry room but were quickly extinguished said 
fire officials 
the burned man was taken to our lady of lourdes health center 
and later transferred to harborview medical center in seattle said 
lourdes nursing supervisor peggy tschauner she identified him as 
steven knight 32

nato sailors who were diverted from 
their maneuvers in the north sea to help search for victims of the 
piper alpha oil platform disaster said saturday it caused in them 
the dread all seamen have of fire 
when you have been at sea you know you are always one step 
away from a disaster like that said rear adm john scott redd of 
the us navy who commands the alliances standing naval force 
atlantic 
you live with that whenever it happens there is a desire to 
come to the assistance of those in trouble on the sea he said 
redd said conditions were excellent in the normally brutal north 
sea as the six nato ships approached the burning wreckage with 
good visibility and relatively calm waters 
we had all the conditions required to find survivors had 
there been any he said if you looked anywhere except where 
the platform was burning it was a nice pleasant day 
the scene around the piper alpha was different however 
it quickly became apparent what an awful tragedy had occurred 
when you saw things like a burnedout lifeboat bits of furniture 
and floating debris from the platform he said 
redd spoke to reporters after the nato warships involved in the 
search returned to portsmouth 65 miles southwest of london 
cmdr alan phillips of the royal navy said his ship hms phoebe 
sometimes was only 400 yards from the platform which exploded and 
burned wednesday night with the loss of 166 lives 
you could hardly see the rig he said it was engulfed in 
flames it brought home the fear any mariner has of fire at sea

secretary of state george p shultz on 
saturday criticized china for building and selling the same 
missiles washington and moscow have agreed to destroy 
there is an irony in that just as we are eliminating 
nucleararmed ballistic missiles in the range of 500 to 5000 
kilometers 310 to 3100 miles the chinese are producing exactly 
those weapons shultz said 
he said beijing was selling the rockets without nuclear 
warheads to countries around the world he did not specify the 
countries 
shultz spoke at a news conference in bangkok thailand before 
traveling to the indonesian capital of jakarta for discussions on 
informal talks scheduled later this month on a political settlement 
of the cambodian war 
he also voiced opposition to a longstanding proposal to declare 
southeast asia a nuclearfree zone saying deterrents have kept 
peace in parts of the world 
the sixmember association of southeast asian nations has 
endorsed the concept of a neutral region free of nuclear weapons 
shultz said attempts should not be made to restrict the quality 
of deterrents by a zonal approach but rather by balanced 
reductions of existing nuclear stockpiles held by the superpowers 
shultz is expected to raise the issue of missile sales when he 
meets with leaders in beijing during his twoweek ninenation 
asian tour 
the tour which began wednesday in bangkok also includes 
malaysia the philipines hong kong south korea japan and the

platform planks on the floor those that are not resolved between

democrat michael dukakis said saturday a plan 
by george bush to boost fees for some government services amounts 
to raising taxes something the republican vice president has said 
he would not do 
i understand yesterday he had some difficulty distinguishing 
between certain kinds of taxes and other taxes dukakis said 
back where i come from if it looks like a duck and walks like a 
duck and quacks like a duck its a duck 
jesse jackson as he attended a private fundraiser in los 
angeles denied reports he and his delegates might stage a walkout 
at the democratic national convention in atlanta 
the threat is not that were going to walk out he told 
reporters the threat is that were going to stay and expand and 
build and grow and make a difference 
he gave no sign of surrendering to the dukakis camp saying 
my name will be in nomination we will have platform planks on 
the floor those that are not resolved between now and that time 
and that should be a reasonable expectation 
dukakis was referring to comments by the vice president that he 
favors higher fees including higher payments for medicare 
recipients who choose to accept catastrophic health care coverage 
under terms of recent health legislation 
i dont know if mr bush has problems trying to distinguish 
between taxes and premiums but i think wed better read the fine 
print in that insurance policy very very carefully before we sign 
on dukakis said in opening remarks at a news conference 
republicans meanwhile holding a rally in atlanta attacked 
dukakis on his search for a running mate his fiscal policies and 
his size 
lee atwater national campaign manager for bush said dukakis 
search for a vice presidential candidate to join him on the ticket 
was making hamlet look like the rock of gibraltar 
atwater also said the massachusetts governors decision to raise 
taxes in his home state while running for president was dumb 
if youre undertaxed vote for dukakis if youre overtaxed 
we want you in our party said rep jack kemp rny a 
former candidate himself for the gop presidential nomination 
sen strom thurmond rsc and florida gov bob martinez made 
cracks about dukakis height 
thurmond called dukakis a mere midget compared to george 
bush 
martinez said the differences in experience between bush and 
dukakis amounted to the tale of the tall and the short 
dukakis is 5 feet 8 inches tall 
dukakis spoke to a group of about 250 students at the evans 
community adult school a public school for immigrants in downtown 
los angeles 
dukakis reminded them of his own immigrant heritage and said to 
them you are the future of this country 
dukakis who will pick up the democratic presidential nomination 
next week in atlanta again found himself faced with repeated 
questioning on his continuing deliberations about the vice 
presidential candidate 
he said he had not made a decision did not know when he would 
announce one and would meet with senior aide paul brountas after 
returning to boston sunday to discuss the choice 
at a later appearance in portland ore dukakis toured a navy 
ship being refitted at the port shipyard and spoke to a small 
crowd he cited the investigation into alleged fraud on pentagon 
weapons contracts and blasted the reagan administration saying it 
not only doesnt believe in public service its contemptuous of 
public service 
i dont know what the true nature is of this breaking scandal 
over the pentagon i dont take any particular pleasure in it i 
think its a very sad day dukakis said but ill tell you this 
im going to do everything i can as president of the united 
states to stop that revolving door between the pentagon and 
defense contractors that often hire former military officials 
dukakis was flying on to tacoma wash for a tour of the port 
on a tugboat he was ending the day in the rocky mountains at estes 
park colo 
dukakis was accompanied throughout his california stop by sen 
alan cranston who sat with him at a los angeles dodgers baseball 
game friday night cranston said he believed sen john glenn of 
ohio remained the most likely vice presidential choice and that 
tennessee sen albert j gore jr would pose a problem if selected 
because he did not run as well in the presidential race as did 
jackson 
i kind of doubt that it will be somebody who ran cranston 
said unless they pick no 2 and thats jesse jackson its a 
little awkward to go to somebody who ran third fourth fifth 
sixth or seventh 
shortly after arriving in california dukakis was asked if he 
was consulting with jackson on the selection of a running mate 
am i consulting him no dukakis saidwere talking and 
hes one of a number of people im considering as he himself has 
said its up to the nominee and ill make that decision

eight members of a convoy carrying aid to 
nicaraguan civilians were arrested saturday during a melee after 
they tried to cross a bridge into mexico 
the scuffle broke out on the international bridge when officers 
sprayed a cayennebased irritant into the truck of the veterans 
peace convoy which had blocked a traffic lane for four hours 
police arrested the eight as 50 of their supporters chanted 
the whole world is watching and rushed past a line of police 
at the bridge toll booth that separates the united states from 
mexico 
customs officers said allowing the trucks to leave the united 
states without assurances they would be returned would violate a 
trade embargo against nicaragua 
the convoy which had tried to cross the same bridge a month 
ago had intended to take 17 vehicles into mexico at noon saturday 
two trucks were driven to the toll booth where customs officers and 
police stopped them 
frank zapata acting chief customs inspector told bob livesey 
driver of the convoys lead pickup that he could not allow him to 
turn onto the mexicobound lane 
this is as far as youre going to get zapata told livesey 
you can turn north back to texas here if you want 
livesey responded were not moving were either going to 
nicaragua through mexico here this is a free border or were 
going to jail he then placed several boxes of baby food on the 
hood of his car and refused to budge 
four hours later police again told the trucks occupants they 
must move the vehicles or be arrested the trucks stayed put and 
officers stuck a nightstick into a window of a truck driven by 
harry meserve 45 of santa cruz calif the window shattered as 
meserve tried to roll it up officers simultaneously sprayed the 
cab with the substance laced with cayenne a very hot irritating 
spice 
about 50 supporters of the convoy had been watching and rushed 
past officers as the arrests began some started pounding on a 
convoy truck shouting the whole world is watching 
livesey 46 a vietnam veteran from massachusetts and meserve 
were among those arrested 
there was a little bit of pushing and shoving but there was 
nothing where anybody was in any real serious danger said 
police chief victor garcia once the arrests were made the crowd 
began following officers orders and moved back he said 
police towed the convoys pickup trucks off the bridge and 
traffic across it was restored to normal soon afterward

troubleshooter red adair took the 
first steps saturday toward capping the wells of a burnedout oil 
platform the rigs owner said it might take three weeks to find 
the bodies of 149 men killed in the north sea disaster 
adairs men explored the twisted remains of the piper alpha 
platform for about an hour saturday and used a cameraequipped 
submersible vessel to assess the damage said a statement from the 
platforms owner los angelesbased occidental petroleum corp 
occidental hired adair to make the rig safe seal gas leaks and 
save the oil wells to which the rig is connected the 73yearold 
adair based in houston texas has gained fame over several 
decades by capping outofcontrol oil wells 
it seems to me there are three or four wells that are burning 
and two are burning pretty good adair said after examining 
the remains of the platform he said everything was going well 
and we expect to stay on schedule but did not elaborate 
id like to say one thing ive never seen so many 
safetyconscious people in my life and i think they are doing an 
excellent job adair said 
the piper alpha exploded wednesday night in a fireball that 
occidental says may have been caused by a gas leak directly below 
the living quarters 
sixtyfour men escaped eighteen remained in the aberdeen royal 
infirmary on saturday one in serious condition 
seventeen bodies were recovered before the search was called off 
friday night around the ruined platform 120 miles east of scotland 
john brading chief executive of occidental international oil 
co told a news conference saturday the company wants to recover 
the bodies but must clear debris from the site of the worlds worst 
oil field disaster and make the area safe for divers 
i think its going to be some days before we remove the 
debris and then the capping will begin brading said in 
aberdeen where most of the bereaved families live or have 
gathered once the situation is safe we will send divers down 
whose first task will be to search for remains 
occidental said fires still burned at several of the platforms 
36 wellheads it said all leaking oil was burning and none was 
escaping to the sea 
brading predicted the piper alpha disaster would bring a whole 
number of changes in north sea oil rigs echoing the views 
expressed friday by occidental chairman armand hammer and prime 
minister margaret thatcher the government has ordered public and 
technical inquiries 
what might have been an acceptable standard for this day last 
week appears to be an unacceptable standard today brading said 
david martin president of occidental oil and gas said living 
quarters may be separate from the production platform in future 
living on something which produces oil and gas is in my 
opinion too dangerous he told the news conference martin said 
workers would have had to be a quartermile from the piper alpha to 
have been safe there is going to be the question of should not 
people living there be on something that can back away in effect 
be a floating hotel he said 
survivor harry calder 35 has said at least 100 men died 
screaming for help trapped in the rigs living quarters after 
suriving the initial explosion 
occidental reported part of the rigs accommodation quarters was 
retrieved from the site saturday and a spokesman said it was 
described as in good condition as far as i know no bodies were 
found on board 
company officials played down a report in the scotsman newspaper 
quoting retired safety manager jack donaldson as saying the company 
ignored safety recommendations after a 1984 explosion on the piper 
alpha that included replacing the wooden livingquarters module 
occidental said the platform complied with all government standards 
a memorial service for the dead will be held wednesday in 
aberdeen

arab governments in the persian gulf find 
the us naval presence oppressive at times but do not plan to 
start opposing it because an american warship shot down an iranian 
airliner officials said saturday 
there also are no signs of a major shift in public opinion in 
the week since missiles fired by the cruiser uss vincennes 
destroyed the iran air jet over the gulf killing all 290 people 
aboard 
the incident was a very big disaster said egypts president 
hosni mubarak at the same time i blame iran because of the 
existence of the state of war and because of its refusal to accept 
peace efforts 
mubarak speaking to reporters cairo after meeting with jordans 
king hussein apparently was referring to the un security 
councils resolution 598 calling for a ceasefire in the iraniraq 
war that has often spilled into the gulf he called on iran to 
accept the resolution in order to avoid more disasters 
iran reported saturday that navy divers pulled five more bodies 
all men from the gulf the bodies were taken to the southern 
iranian city of bandar abbas for identification the airliner took 
off from the citys airport before it was downed 
one body was identified as that of jamshar morad ibrahim a 
citizen of the united arab emirates according to an iranian tv 
report monitored in nicosia cyprus previous iranian reports said 
less than 200 bodies had been recovered and only 150 identified 
thirtyeight of the passengers were foreigners 
some statements by governments and editorial writers criticize 
the us action for causing loss of life but generally express the 
view that the culprit is the iraniraq war rather than the united 
states the two persian gulf neighbors have been at war since 
september 1980 
public attitudes appear to reflect that sentiment said editor 
mahbub jamal zahedi of the khaleej times a major newspaper in the 
united arab emirates just across the southern gulf from iran 
sympathy for irans point of view is perhaps stronger in the 
emirates than in any other arab gulf state about 150000 iranian 
citizens and many other ethnic iranians live in the federation 
which has close commercial ties with iran 
the widespread feeling is that the tragedy should not have 
taken place zahedi said it would not have taken place if the 
war had stopped as long as the war continues such things will 
happen 
seventeen residents of the emirates were on the passenger list 
of last sundays flight 655 from bandar abbas across the strait of 
hormuz to dubai 
zahedis newspaper printed a full page blackbordered thanks 
for condolences ad saturday signed by a ranking police official 
of the emirates whose father was among the dead 
khaled abdul latif ahmed a young kuwaiti staying at a hotel in 
dubai said the tragedy made people in the emirates very angry 
when asked whether the us fleet should be withdrawn from the 
gulf he replied no but maybe there is a problem between iran 
and america 
most editorials have stressed the need to end the war but some 
newspapers took the opportunity to condemn the united states for a 
middle east policy built around support for israel the universal 
arab enemy 
the united states downed the whole region decades ago said 
al khaleej published in the sharjah emirate 
many arab officials say the us military commitment has helped 
bring stability but they find the navys presence sometimes 
difficult to bear 
on monday the day after the iranian plane was shot down an 
arab diplomat said privately that a broadening us role can only 
mean more explosive situations 
a western diplomat whose territory includes most of the gulf 
from kuwait in the north to oman on the strait of hormuz said most 
officials with whom he deals feel the war is to blame for the 
disaster 
they are stunned by the tragedy but theyre not blaming the 
united states although they are trying now to distance themselves 
from the americans as much as possible they are not prepared to 
kick uncle sam he said speaking on condition of anonymity 
that viewpoint came through in statements by arab governments 
which avoided direct criticism of washington 
continuation of the destructive iraqiran war threatens the 
entire region with more tragedies day after day said an official 
source in bahrain an island state that provides limited port 
facilities to the us navy 
kuwaits foreign ministry said more painful incidents could 
take place unless the war ends and qatar issued a similar 
statement 
king fahd of saudi arabia which broke relations with iran this 
year after accusing it of terrorism and subversion was said to 
have called for vigilance to confront any sudden development 
his apparent reference was to threats of revenge some iranian 
officials made after the plane was shot down 
concern about iranian retaliation is especially strong in 
kuwait which has been hit by iranian missiles and terrorist 
bombings blamed on proiran extremists iran accuses the sheikdom 
of helping iraq the united states at kuwaits request has 
reflagged 11 kuwaiti tankers so the navy can protect them 
they are expecting something dramatic said a western 
diplomat based in kuwait they think they are the ones to take 
the heat they think american actions have got them in trouble

bartenders on saturday approved a 
settlement with pub owners over a pay dispute that developed after 
the irish parliament passed new laws to extend pub hours 
the laws approved last month in an effort to accommodate the 
tourist industry came into operation smoothly in the rest of the 
country but in dublin the bartenders demanded extra pay and 
threatened to strike saturday morning 
the 3000 union bartenders in the city earn an average 300 a 
week and wanted 45 a week more and an extra half day off every two 
weeks if they were going to work the new hours which would 
increase their 40hour work week by an hour 
publicans offered a onetime goodwill payment of 150 to 
bartenders with more than six months service and an extra 18 a 
week 
union leaders recommended acceptance of the offer and barmen 
approved it by a vote of 628 to 539 
there are about 750 pubs in the city area about 500 of them 
employing union members the rest of the pubs are run by families 
and have been operating the new hours 
the pubs used to close at 1130 pm in summer and 11 pm in 
winter monday through saturday now they can close at midnight in 
summer and 1130 in winter they get an extra hour sunday closing 
at 11 instead of 10 pm 
the onehour afternoon closure between 230 and 330 pm in 
effect in dublin and cork only also has been eliminated 
the main aim of the new laws was to answer complaints from the 
tourist industry that visitors thought closing time was too early

residents of this southern indiana farming 
town offer nervous jokes about the 13 dynamite bombs that were 
found beneath bridges behind businesses and two historic buildings 
the bombs traced to a theft of dynamite last month in another 
indiana town were defective and failed to detonate but the 
thought of what might have happened has made an impact on the town 
of 6000 
patrons at donannas restaurant kidded each other friday about 
the 300 sticks of dynamite found with clocks and makeshift blasting 
caps 
theyll look under a chair and say is there a bomb under 
here and laugh said forest p noland a manager at the 
restaurant 
but says noland it isnt anything to joke about really 
rewards totaling 10000 have been offered for information about 
the explosives the us bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
posted the original 5000 reward thursday and the indiana arson 
crime association matched that friday 
now anyone who calls stands to gain 10000 so maybe it will 
help said atf spokesman joe v thurman 
thurman said about 35 investigators from his agency the fbi 
the army and state police were in the town about 30 miles northwest 
of louisville ky 
on saturday thurman said the dynamite used in the bombs had 
been traced to a theft at mulzer crushed stone in english 
he said the dynamite which was stolen between june 6 and 13 
also has been linked to a bomb similar to those planted in salem 
that exploded along indiana 37 about a mile south of english on 
july 1 the town of english is about 30 miles southwest of here 
a passing motorist reported some smoke and fire at a roadside 
rest area thurman said it was the same type of device and the 
dynamite was from the same theft there have been no arrests in 
the theft 
three of the dynamite bundles found tuesday morning detonated 
partially producing smoke and small fires authorities closed off 
the central business district and disarmed the 10 remaining bombs 
which had been concealed in brown grocery bags and covered with 
debris 
mayor frank newkirk sr said the explosives were the work of 
terrorists but others disagree 
i think whoever did it just wanted publicity said noland 
if they were serious they could have rigged at least one of them 
to go off anyway out of 13 
the bombs failed to explode because black powder charges 
intended to trigger the dynamite was improperly packed 
investigators said 
dynamite is no harder to obtain than a handgun in indiana since 
it is used in road construction in quarries and in mining it 
requires careful handling but the techniques are widely known in 
the construction and mining trades 
im no expert but you dont need to be a specialist for 
something like that said noland who also owns a 130acre farm 
outside nearby pekin 
mitch ferguson a retired contractor who used explosives in road 
construction noted reports from investigators that the amount of 
dynamite involved could have leveled a sizable portion of the 
downtown 
they were just lucky that whoever did it didnt know anything 
about black powder ferguson said 
police have refused to discuss a possible motive and residents 
could point to no communitywide disputes in the town 
i think theyre interested in any theory said state rep 
frank newkirk jr a former deputy county prosecutor who now has a 
private law practice 
a bomb containing 52 sticks of dynamite was found beneath the 
wooden back steps to his office and newkirk had a long meeting 
with investigators late in the week 
newkirk doubted he was the target of the explosives and the 
fact that most of the bombs were placed near government property 
might not mean much either he said 
often with a crime like this when you look for some 
philosophical explanation what you find instead is some personal 
selfish explanation he said its just as likely that this was 
done to destroy documents or collect insurance 
police and federal agents set up a command post at salem high 
school and questioned residents doortodoor throughout the week 
some found the police presence reassuring but wondered what would 
happen if authorities left without making an arrest 
i find myself when i drive down the street looking in the 
faces of the people i pass said newkirk im asking myself is 
this the kind of person who would do something like that

lawmakers 
much of the corn belt is entering the critical pollination stage 
when kernels are formed on the corn ears agriculture experts said 
but heat speeds up the shedding of pollen from corn tassles and 
delays the emergence of corn silks which accept the pollen grains 
to form the seed agronomists say 
agronomists at purdue university in indiana wont speculate on 
potential losses but say at least 25 percent of that states 12 
billion corn crop already has been lost 
its potentially one of the worst things weve ever seen in 
corn said agronomist robert nielson purdues top corn expert 
experts in iowa have estimated that half of that states corn 
crop will be lost gov terry branstad declared the entire state a 
disaster area friday 
corn yields in north dakota are expected to be cut by about 40 
percent and even with adequate rain through the rest of the 
summer yields could be as low as 56 bushels an acre statewide 
according to robert thompson president of the north dakota corn 
growers association last year the state averaged 96 bushels of 
corn per acre 
wed have to have better than average rainfall to get that 60 
percent yield potential thompson said if we dont get three 
or four inches of rain in the near future we wont get that

some 360000 gallons of radioactive water 
were released into a stream at the savannah river plant 
environmental officials were told saturday 
plant spokesman james felder who attributed the release to a 
procedural error said the spill friday should not affect the 
health of the workers or the public around the plant located in 
aiken county sc across the savannah river from augusta 
south carolina and georgia environmental authorities were 
notified saturday morning although the amounts of the release did 
not require notification the augusta chronicle and the augusta 
herald reported in their combined sunday editions 
the water contained two to three millicuries of cesium137 a 
waste byproduct known to cause cancer felder said standards allow 
a maximum annual release of 175 millicuries by the end of may 50 
millicuries had been released at the plant 
its a very high release for a 12hour period felder said 
but its well within our guidelines 
the contaminated water was expected to reach the savannah river 
about 630 pm sunday felder said most of cesium137 would settle 
to the bottom of four mile creek

rescue workers removed the last four 
victims from the wreckage of a collapsed department store saturday 
and said the death toll was 14 not 16 as feared earlier officials 
said the disaster might have been caused by a clogged storm drain 
on the buildings roof 
there is no need to check again we have checked 
doublechecked triplechecked and quadruplechecked there are no 
more bodies in there said walter plitt head of a heavy 
equipment company that supplied some of the machinery used in the 
rescue effort 
mayor ygnacio garza concurred saying officials were convinced 
that the last victim had been found 
two adults and four children were rescued from the massive pile 
of rubble friday but at least 47 were injured in addition to the 
14 who died 
in all four bodies were recovered saturday confusion about the 
death toll continued until the final victim leticia silva de 
carrera was removed from the debris late saturday afternoon 
officials had said they believed that the body of mrs carreras 
4yearold son israel was with her under the rubble but they 
later determined that israels body was one of those that had been 
found earlier in the day they had also thought they saw another 
victim near mrs carreras body but when her body was recovered 
this proved not to be the case they said 
clogged drainage holes on the buildings flat roof could have 
contributed to the collapse by allowing rain water to accumulate 
and possibly overload the building said kermit cromack tax 
assessorcollector for cameron county 
if you were the owner of the store how many times would you 
go up and see if the drainage pipes were clogged especially if 
its a threestory building cromack asked 
tony yzaguirre jr a city tax assessorcollector said the 
building was inspected earlier this year by the fire department as 
it is annually 
minimal construction standards contributed to the tragedy other 
officials charged 
that old store was nothing more than a stack of blocks 
cromack said this was bound to happen sooner or later 
the third floor of the 20yearold building was added in 1975 
and cromack said the buildings construction was average for one 
that age in the area explaining we dont build as heavy as they 
do elsewhere because we dont have snow 
the roof is not designed to carry all that weight 
brownsville building inspector fernando romero told the dallas 
morning news its a tragedy and one that may happen again at any 
time 
bernard levin owner of the amigo store could not immediately 
be reached for comment a woman who answered the phone at his home 
said she was a friend and she didnt know where he was or when he 
would return 
garza said investigations were being launched by the city the 
buildings insurance company and the federal occupational safety 
and health administration 
garza said the rainstorm which poured 2 inches in less than 30 
minutes may have been a factor but that other factors also may 
have played a role 
we have a report from witnesses that a bolt of lightning 
struck behind the building and hit some transformers and perhaps 
knocked them down garza said 
rescue workers had concentrated their efforts saturday on two 
sites in the rear of the building where us border patrol 
drugand peoplesniffing dogs indicated spots where people living 
or dead might be trapped workers formed human chains to remove 
debris basket by basket 
rescuers were removing chunks of concrete broken cinderblocks 
shattered glass merchandise and splintered tables 
by this time tomorrow morning the building wont be there 
anymore terry ray a construction foreman leading the digging 
effort said saturday were no longer allowing any tunneling 
were in the process of taking apart the building layer by layer 
by late afternoon all but about 10 percent of the debris had 
been removed 
medical workers forced volunteers and rescue workers to take a 
break because of the 90degree heat and high humidity 
were losing more fluids now than were taking in said 
police sgt dean poos 
alan mesh a demolition expert with ferromar inc of brownsville 
who has assisted in the rescue since thursday said workers had to 
tunnel through three layers of twoinchthick concrete before 
reaching the six survivors 
mesh said the stores safe acted like a tent pole and kept the 
main beam from collapsing on the six

excavation at a construction site near 
independence hall has stopped while archaeologists examine a trove 
of pottery glass and other artifacts unearthed from an 
18thcentury privy 
archaeologists said they believe the site was honeycombed with 
other shafts into which the debris of everyday life in colonial 
philadelphia was tossed creating over the decades a layered time 
capsule of the 18th century 
athough the extent of the find still is unknown archaeologists 
are excited 
i havent seen the artifacts i just went down there and 
eyeballed the privy and i was very much impressed with it this 
could be quite significant said john cotter former chief 
archaeologist for the national park services eastern region and 
curator emeritus of american historical archaeology at the 
university of pennsylvania 
on wednesday national park service employees alerted excavators 
to the presence of the privies bricklined shafts built beneath 
outhouses 
eight privies and potentially thousands of artifacts in them 
were destroyed by the latest digging at the site said robert 
giannini assistant curator of cermics and glass for the park but 
the top of one crumbling dirtfilled brick shaft was saved when 
digging was halted thursday 
a 140bed hotel and 442car garage to be operated by omni 
international is being built at the site by developer kevin f 
donohue 
he agreed to stop the excavation after park service employees 
saw the pottery shards and the privy shafts brick linings being 
lifted out by the construction crew 
philadelphia historical commission members and the developer 
plan to meet to figure out how to remove the artifacts and allow 
construction to continue said richard tyler the commissions 
preservation officer 
cotter said some privy shafts of the 18th century were actually 
deep wells illegally used as privies the area was residential in 
the 18th century but in the 19th century was developed into a 
banking area construction of a bank on the site probably caused 
the razing of the outhouse structures and the destruction of the 
top of the shafts cotter said

for some of those inside the amigo 
store the discount department store was merely a refuge from a 
powerful rainstorm 
some of the people killed when the stores roof collapsed had 
never shopped at the store along a busy commercial section 
downtown blocks from the mexico border they ducked inside the 
threestory building for shelter from the 2 inches of rain that 
fell in a half hour thursday afternoon relatives said 
adrian davila silva 15 vividly recalls the moments before and 
after the collapse saying his family never had shopped at the 
store 
we were just walking down the street but we couldnt walk 
anymore because it was raining too hard he said we all got 
into the store 
we were five meters inside the store and i was near my cousin 
charlene and then suddenly there was something like an explosion 
it got dark and the walls fell said davila 
i saw some light and thats where we climbed out of there 
he said i expected to see destruction everywhere when i got out 
but it was only this building 
about 100 people were in the store when the 30ton roof 
collapsed at least 14 people were killed and 47 injured rescue 
workers continued clearing debris late saturday afternoon but said 
they believed they had recovered all the bodies 
officials had said earlier that 16 people died in the collapse 
but revised the figure downward saturday afternoon 
six survivors were found friday underneath tons of concrete 
twisted steel and broken glass that showered down on them when the 
roof collapsed 
it doesnt sound like we will find anybody else alive said 
police spokesman sgt dean poos 
relatives of those trapped had stayed near the scene and prayed 
including dr jose carrera of matamoros mexico whose wife 
leticia and their 4yearold son israel had been among the

new tests show that the b1 bombers electronic 
warfare system has design flaws that could prevent it from reaching 
the air forces planned capabilities for the warplane according to 
a published report 
the washington post in its sunday editions said the flaws 
detected in the tests could force the pentagon to reroute possible 
bombing runs through the soviet union in the event of nuclear war 
the newspaper cited an internal congressional document written 
by house armed services committee chairman les aspin dwis who 
received a classified air force briefing late last week on the 
problems and pentagon sources 
the plane was designed to be capable of a nuclear attack 
against the soviet union aspin said it is now called into 
question whether it will ever be able to do that mission in the way 
it was advertised 
the air force said the existing system was discovered to be 
incapable of meeting the specification requirements 
aspin was in wisconsin for the weekend and could not be reached 
for comment by the associated press pentagon spokeswoman capt 
nancy laluntas had no comment on the report 
air force officials said the tests found that parts of the 
planes electronic countermeasures system designed to help 
protect the lowflying penetrating aircraft on its most critical 
bombing missions does not work and cannot be corrected without 
major changes the newspaper said 
aspin who has been a critic of the air forces management of 
the b1 program said the test results were a major setback for the 
28 billion bomber program 
the b1 bombers history has been beset with controversy the 
pentagon began production of the b1 but former president carter 
killed the program saying it was too costly and was made 
unnecessary by development of stealth bombers designed to make 
detection difficult 
president reagan revived the b1 calling it a critical leg of 
his strategic plan and won congressional funding for 100 planes by 
vowing to keep a ceiling on the price 
since the first bombers became operational in the fall of 1986 
the plane has been plagued by problems ranging from its flight 
controls to its terrainhugging radar 
aspin sent committee members a memorandum stating that the 
recently completed tests carried out by the air force and eaton 
the electronic countermeasures systems builder revealed 
limitations within the current system architecture that will 
prevent the b1 ecm from ever achieving full operational 
capability the newspaper said 
the architecture isnt any good and its back to the 
drawing board he said

irans ambassador tried 
to cool the tempers of mourners at an embassy memorial service for 
the 290 people killed when a us warship shot down an iranian 
airliner 
imam khomeini becomes the inheritor on earth of any one of us 
who is unjustly killed and only he has the right to decide when 
and how to take revenge for those innocent victims ambassador 
mustafa foumeni haeri told hundreds of mourners in the embassy 
grounds late thursday 
lets not take any hasty action he said in farsi the 
iranian language 
after an hour of weeping conducted by two poets trained in the 
mourning ceremony the crowd chanted khomeini khomeini we 
await your orders long life to you death to reagan 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini is the supreme religious guide for 
iranians and leader of the fundamentalist islamic revolution that 
ousted the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi in february 1979 
haeris appeal for calm coincided with the mood of statements by 
hashemi rafsanjani irans military commander and parliament 
speaker he told a prayer meeting friday iran would not seek 
revenge for destruction of the airliner 
the united states is trying to push us to commit the same 
crime but if we did that the world would turn against us 
rafsanjani said that is why we do not push to take revenge wise 
people understand why we do not take revenge 
about 150000 iranians live in the united arab emirates across 
the southern persian gulf from iran the memorial service was held 
in a mosque attached to the new embassy its persian arches were 
festooned with antiamerican slogans 
the ambassador said the mode and style of the revenge will 
not be such that the world would condemn it and thus we lose the 
international sympathy with iran over the airbus victims

reach a new grain agreement in a third round of talks which ended 
here friday alan f holmer the head of the us team announced 
under a fiveyear agreement that expires on sept30 the soviets 
are committed to buying 9 million tons of us grain a year

purchasing total 
the drought in the united states was not a significant issue in 
the discussions holmer said in reply to a question 
he said that thomas kay administrator of the foreign 
agricultural service explained to the soviets why we have ample 
stocks and production more than meet us domestic needs and export 
commitments 
there are a number of signficiant issues where we would like 
to have changes and where they would like to have changes holmer 
said but added i sense a strong desire on both sides for a new 
agreement 
the vienna talks lasted two days previous negotiating rounds 
took place in washington in march and in london in may

j n chumakov goes on vacation on july 25 we will know when 
and where and whether there will be another round of discussions 
holmer said the vienna meeting had been useful and we made 
considerable progress in a number of areas but differences 
still remain 
the two sides now are now at a stage where they need to review 
their positions with their governments said holmer who met 
reporters at his hotel

the head of the international monetary fund 
cautioned participating banks on friday that failure to upgrade aid 
to the debtor nations would slow their financial growth 
unless the banks do more to support adjustment efforts of 
middleincome counties the notion that our debt strategy is a 
collaborative one oriented to growth will not pass serious 
scrutiny michel camdessus said 
indeed it will prevent the resumption of an adequate rate of 
growth and all sides will lose he said in a speech prepared for 
a meeting of the united nations economic and social council in 
geneva 
camdessus endorsed agreements between the debtor nations and 
creditors for new arrangements to reduce the estimated 12 
trillion debt of certain third world the nations with the largest 
debts are in latin america brazil mexico and argentina where 
us banks are the largest lenders 
he expressed concern over difficulties in developing loan 
packages for those governments trying to adjust to their 
international debt problems such packages usually include loans by 
the fund itself by commercial banks and by intergovernmental 
lenders like the world bank 
adjustments required in return for the loans generally include 
austerity programs that debtor governments find difficult 
camdessus said programs to adjust debtor countries to a better 
handling of their funds will in many cases have costs in the short 
run but will eventually help their citizens and particularly the 
poor 
the poor would almost certainly suffer much more in the 
absence of corrective action he said noting that the poor can 
be protected at least to some degree by compensatory measures 
camdessus noted that some adjustment measures are of immediate 
help to some poor people such as increased prices for farm 
products that help the poor in rural areas

soviet premier nikolai ryzhkov on 
friday repeated a kremlin proposal to withdraw the red army from 
all foreign territory by the year 2000 apparently ruling out any 
imminent pullout of russian troops from czechoslovakia and other 
soviet bloc countries 
the soviet government chief told western reporters such moves 
could come only in the context of a general withdrawal involving 
other nations as well as the soviet union 
he also seemed to dash hopes for any rehabilitation soon of 
alexander dubcek the former communist party leader in 
czechoslovakia 
his exchanges with the reporters were often acrimonious 
ryzhkov confirmed that at the recent communist party conference 
kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev stressed the need for 
socialism with a human face 
that phrase was used to describe dubceks liberal prague 
spring of 1968 which provoked a sovietled warsaw pact invasion 
in august of that year and cost dubcek his job as party chief here 
western reporters asked ryzhkov who attended a threeday 
economic conference that ended thursday whether the time had not 
come for dubcek to be rehabilitated 
he replied the rehabilitation of dubcek that is a question 
for czechoslovakia i do not intend to deal with the internal 
problems of czechoslovakia as far as i know the czechoslovak party 
does not intend to deal with that 
dubcek now 66 said in an austrian television interview 
broadcast thursday that the current leadership in prague should 
adopt gorbachevs reforms most are similar to reforms dubcek 
introduced here 20 years ago 
red army units are stationed in several soviet bloc countries 
including czechoslovakia 
ryzhkov said his government feels no armies should be on foreign 
territory us british or soviet 
our proposal is this let us take out all the armies he 
said the armies in czechoslovakia are part of the warsaw pact 
armies let us agree on a radical solution in the west and in the 
east 
on the theme of socialism with a human face ryzhkov said 
socialism must work for man all our deeds and our reforms must 
work for man we need the participation of man in the whole process 
a great step has been taken toward democratization toward 
glasnost openness and that is not possible without man 
a soviet journalist complained about lack of information during 
the conference of comecon the soviet bloc equivalent of the 
european economic community 
ryzhkov said he agreed and the practice should be changed 
fundamentally because 95 percent of our the questions 
discussed are not in any way secret 
he expressed hope the next session in sofia bulgaria would be 
different because we really have nothing to hide 
in reference to communiques issued after soviet bloc meetings 
which rarely reveal differences of opinion ryzhkov declared it 
is useless to say that 10 countries have the same opinion this is 
naive

police friday began arresting 135 people 
indicted on more than 2000 felony charges resulting from an 
undercover investigation that brought in 380 cars valued at more 
than 4 million authorities said 
we worked 12 to 14hour days buying cars and returning them 
to the insurance companies said detective thomas del regno of 
the cleveland police department 
the rented garage the undercover operation used held only six 
cars so officers had to turn the vehicles over to insurance 
companies quickly del regno said 
the 16month undercover operation netted stolen cars from 50 
cities as far away as pennsylvania and michigan he said cleveland 
has one of the 10 highest auto theft rates in the country he added 
del regno said police arrested 45 to 50 people friday and served 
arrest warrants against 20 other who are already behind bars on 
other charges arrests are expected to continue during the weekend 
those arrested were charged with receiving stolen property and 
possession of criminal tools cuyahoga county assistant prosecutor 
mary haas said 
two people who allegedly sold police more than 50 cars each face 
nearly 100 counts the total number of charges is well over 
2000 but i really havent kept track she said 
del regno said two undercover police officers set up the 
operation by contacting alleged thieves through an informant who 
let it be known that if they came across any cars we were 
available 
he said police who videotaped their car deals in three 
cleveland parking lots never had to solicit business 
thieves often came to sell cars within hours of stealing them 
del regno said sometimes even before people knew their cars were 
stolen 
he said most cars came from young independents known as 
rippers who were only interested in a quick buck but the 
large number of cars some sellers turned over made police suspect 
the involvement of several car theft rings

consumer prices rose 413 percent for the 
first half of 1988 the business daily el financiero reported 
friday 
it tabulated the figures from the bank of mexicos announcement 
that inflation rose 2 percent in june slightly above the 19 
percent increase in may 
el financieros report noted that despite an increase in june 
figures for both months were the lowest registered since november 
1981 
inflation has been reduced by an economic solidarity pact 
designed by the government in december and endorsed by business and 
labor consumer prices hit a record 1592 percent last year 
president miguel de la madrid announced the program after 
officials became worried that mexico was on the verge of spiraling 
into hyperinflation a problem that has plagued other latin 
american countries 
critics say the pact was intended to artificially control 
inflation before wednesdays general elections 
the president concludes his sixyear term on nov 30 with his 
successor virtually certain to be carlos salinas de gortari of the 
institutional revolutionary party that has governed mexico since 
1929 
the budget and planning secretary pedro aspe said wednesday 
that it will be up to the next administration to decide if the pact 
continues past november 
he told reporters that the agreement remains in effect at least 
through august and that its status for the last three months of de 
la madrids term wont be determined until the middle of next month 
a bank of mexico report issued late thursday said a beef 
shortage in turn prompted increases in prices of chicken and pork 
and so contributed to higher prices as did a longer than usual dry 
season that caused increases in fruit and vegetable prices 
among other factors in junes consumer price rises were 
residential rents which were 43 percent higher and represented 
the largest single increase the central bank said prices on basic 
foods and other essentials rose 4 percent 
of the 35 cities checked the highest increases were 43 percent 
in zamora in western michoacan state and 25 percent in toluca 
40 miles west of mexico city 
the banks report said the solidarity pact continues being 
successful in holding down the inflationary process 
a key component of the inflationfighting program is a freeze on 
the minimum wage prices of governmentregulated goods and services 
and the exchange rate of the peso currency

gesell clears the way for the fired white house aide to go to trial 
at least on charges he lied to cover up his activities and 
personally gained from his involvement in the irancontra affair 
the judges order scheduling the trial for sept 20 set the 
stage for the proceeding to take place in the middle of the fall 
presidential campaign 
in addition to fixing the trial date gesell ruled that north is 
entitled to use highly classified documents that might show the 
covert activities that are the basis of the irancontra conspiracy 
charge were authorized by the reagan administration 
the judge noted that some highly sensitive portions of documents 
in the prosecutions case that government security experts want 
deleted tended to exonerate north of guilt on certain charges

shaken by the first schism in the roman catholic 
church in more than a century the vatican has moved with unusual 
speed to try to win back followers of renegade archbishop marcel 
lefebvre 
but it is showing no leniency for those who intend to follow the 
82yearold frenchman who consecrated four bishops without papal 
approval june 30 and was excommunicated 
lefebvre contends the vatican has broken with true catholicism 
by adopting mass in languages other than latin and by taking other 
modernist steps 
within days of lefebvres defiant act the vatican firmly stated 
that it would not tolerate lefebvre sympathizers but it made clear 
that it hoped to persuade them to be loyal to the roman catholic 
church rather than follow lefebvre out of it

before noon last sunday capt william c rogers iii was at war 
his ship the guidedmissile cruiser uss vincennes had engaged 
five iranian speedboats in the strait of hormuz 
on the iranian side of the strait at the militarycivilian 
airport in bandar abbas capt mohsen rezaian of the airline iran 
air was revving up his airbus a300 for a 150mile hop across the 
water to dubai he had nearly a full load 290 passengers and crew 
among the passengers pakistans military attache in iran who 
boarded with his wife and two children an iranian couple flying to 
dubai to shop for a daughters wedding a woman flying with her 
eight children to meet her husband an iranian merchant in dubai 
indians afghans yugoslavs an italian going about their peaceful 
business in a region at war 
the old persian port of bandar abbas was a place capt rogers 
had to keep an eye on it was becoming an important base for iran 
in the 8yearold conflict with iraq 
us officials said iran had moved a few of its hottest fighters 
usbuilt f14 tomcats to bandar abbas it also was believed 
to be a base for antiship silkworm missiles and the vincennes 
assignment was to protect merchant ships from the silkworms 
the mix of civilian and military traffic through the gulfs hazy 
skies was a headache for us patrols 
an iranian f4 would take off from bandar abbas and right 
behind it is a commercial aircraft said one navy veteran of the 
gulf rear adm rg zeller they would both take roughly the 
same route for a while initially its very difficult to 
distinguish between the two we had to be awfully careful for 
obvious reasons 
the billiondollar aegisclass cruiser vincennes a major piece 
of us muscle had been in the gulf only a month 
it carried the latest in what rogers jokingly called geewhiz 
merchandise including phasedarray radars designed to 
simultaneously identify and evaluate the threat from dozens of 
potential targets 
putting this ship with its radar into the gulf will put a lot 
of battle management on the scene rogers had told reporters who 
toured the newly arrived vessel 
to deal with hostile targets the vincennes bristled with 
harpoon and standard missiles antisubmarine rockets two 5inch 
guns and two phalanx closein rapidfire guns to knock down 
incoming missiles if it flies it dies boasted the crew of 
the first aegis cruiser 
at 1010 am last sunday the pentagon later reported iranian 
patrol boats fired on a helicopter from the vincennes the patrol 
boats are 43foot boghammar pleasure boats made in sweden souped 
up with big engines machine guns and rocketpropelled grenades 
at 1037 am according to brig gen mansour satari the 
iranian air force commander rezaian switched on the twin engines 
of the a300 and opened communications with the tower to prepare for 
takeoff 
five minutes later by the pentagons chronology the iranian 
patrol boats turned toward the vincennes at high speed and opened 
fire the vincennes and the frigate elmer montgomery returned fire 
sinking two patrol boats and damaging a third 
at 1045 am iran air flight 655 was airborne and within two 
minutes the vincennes was checking it out by radar quickly 
reviewing the data from the geewhiz merchandise rogers 
concluded that the blip was an attacking f14 he gave the order to 
fire and one of two sm2 standard missiles from the vincennes 
scored a kill 
it was then 1054 am 254 am in washington 
at 345 am edt the white house situation room notified 
national security adviser colin powell and other officials of the 
incident at 452 am powell woke up president reagan at camp 
david to report that us forces believe they had shot down an 
iranian jet fighter 
meanwhile news reports from the region quoted shipping sources 
as saying an iranian airbus had crashed in the persian gulf 
within an hour irans islamic republic news agency reported 
that the plane had been downed by the us forces 
at the dubai airport a shipping executive reported seeing 
dozens of people crowding the iran air booth for information about 
the overdue plane among them the executive told the ap was the 
iranian merchant 
the man just went out of his mind going from pillar to post 
and banging his head the executive said 
shortly before 8 am edt a pentagon spokesman lt col arnold 
williams told reporters that us forces sank two patrol boats and 
shot down an f14 us officials are aware of the iranian claim 
he added and were checking it out 
at 811 am reagan was given a written update noting the 
iranian claim at 950 am reagan was notified that the target 
apparently was a civilian aircraft 
in the early afternoon the president issued a statement saying 
us forces in a proper defensive action unintentionally shot 
down a passenger plane 
the course of the iranian civilian airliner was such that it 
was headed directly for the uss vincennes which was at the time 
engaged with five iranian boghammar boats that had attacked our 
forces when the aircraft failed to heed repeated warnings the 
vincennes followed standing orders and widely publicized 
procedures firing to protect itself against possible attack 
reagans statement said 
said rogers in a message back to the states this is a burden 
that i will carry the rest of my life but i took this action to 
defend my ship and my crew i alone am responsible

tentacles from the ivan boesky insider trading 
scandal surfaced in a surprising way this past week with the 
indictment of gaf corp for stock manipulation 
securities lawyers said such charges against a large us 
industrial company are highly unusual and suggest the government is 
toughening and expanding its crackdown on wall street corruption 
at the same time however they said stock manipulation is 
always difficult to prove and that federal prosecutors could face a 
timeconsuming and possibly embarassing court fight with gaf a 
major producer of chemicals and building materials based in wayne 
nj 
the 10count indictment returned by a manhattan federal grand 
jury last wednesday against gaf vice chairman james t sherwin and 
two subsidiaries alleges they manipulated union carbide corp stock 
in 1986 after a failed takeover attempt of the much larger chemical 
company 
the object of the purported scheme was to induce other investors 
to buy carbide shares and thereby inflate the price so gaf could 
sell its 10 percent stake at a better profit or with minimal loss 
the indictment alleges 
if convicted on all counts gaf could face 15 million in fines 
while sherwin could face a 50year prison term and 25 million in 
fines gaf and sherwin have proclaimed innocence and vowed to 
contest the charges 
it is the first indictment brought against an american 
industrial concern stemming from evidence supplied indirectly by 
boesky a wellknown stock speculator now serving a threeyear 
prison term for his central role in the biggest insider trading 
case in history 
the connection between boesky and gaf is boyd l jefferies 
former head of a west coast brokerage that bears his name he was 
implicated by boesky after the speculator agreed to cooperate with 
the governments investigation 
jefferies who also has pleaded guilty to criminal charges and 
is cooperating with the government is the main source of 
information that led federal prosecutors to investigate gaf 
this appears to be part of the governments pattern of looking 
at market practices of all kinds said john f olson a 
securities attorney at the washington law firm of gibson dunn amp 
crutcher and chairman of the american bar associations task force 
on insidertrading regulation 
were seeing more of that and more focus on it he said 
this also shows that prosecutors are continuing to reap the 
benefits of deals they made with boesky and jefferies 
nevertheless securities lawyers said that in the gaf case one 
of the main legal challenges facing the government will be to prove 
a conspiracy existed to influence the price of carbides stock 
carbide is one of the largest publicly held companies and a 
component of the dow jones industrial average with more than 127 
million common shares on any given day its stock price could 
change for a number of innocuous reasons ranging from an analysts 
earnings estimate to a stockbuyback rumor 
some people familiar with the gaf indictment who spoke on 
condition they not be identified said a second potential problem 
facing the government is its possible use of jefferies as a 
witness because jefferies is an admitted felon defense lawyers 
could successfully destroy his credibility before a jury 
a third problem confronting prosecutors is whether the alleged 
manipulation succeeded the government claims carbide shares rose 
in price as a result although records show gaf didnt sell its 
stake until several days later 
several attorneys said they doubted prosecutors would have 
sought an indictment unless they had much more than evidence 
supplied by jefferies 
others also noted that unlike civil cases rules concerning 
evidence in criminal matters are biased in the governments favor 
the defendants may not know until trial what incriminating material 
the prosecutors will present 
i have to assume that if its a criminal case the government 
will be ready to go to trial and the judge will certainly push the 
case to trial relatively quickly said gerald walpin a partner 
at the new york law firm of rosenman amp colin and a former assistant 
us attorney i think certainly within six months well know 
exactly what the governments case is 
the gaf indictment wasnt the only development in the boesky 
scandal this past week speculation heightened that the securities 
and exchange commission was about to file civil charges against 
drexel burnham lambert inc the wall street investment firm that 
has been under government investigation for months 
another boesky conspirator inside trader dennis b levine was 
transferred from prison to serve the remainder of his twoyear term 
in a manhattan halfway house but in a setback for levine a 
federal judge ruled he must use his 128 million in illicit 
profits to repay defrauded investors and not back taxes which 
total 122 million in federal claims alone

after weeks of playing followthesoybeans traders in a number 
of commodity markets are looking elsewhere for signals on whether 
to buy or sell 
some of these markets such as gold and sugar have only a 
marginal interest in grain and soybean prices to begin with 
others cotton in particular have almost no real relationship 
to soybeans and are cooling down after a frantic ride on the 
drought train courtesy of market speculators 
the midwestern drought remains the dominant influence in the 
grain and soybean markets and in the livestock markets where the 
price of feed grain is directly related to production costs 
but the droughts diminishing impact on the prices of other 
commodities illustrates how the powerful psychology of a runaway 
market can sweep others along with it until the facts get in the 
way 
in the end the fundamentals always reign supreme said 
ernest simon cotton specialist with prudential bache securities 
inc in new york 
in the cotton market the fundamentals include the agriculture 
departments prediction of a 56 millionbale surplus on july 31 
the end of the current marketing year and a whopping 68 
millionbale surplus a year later there is nearly enough cotton in 
storage to fulfill all of next years expected domestic demand 
twice as much as experts consider adequate 
before the drought began the usda estimated 198889 cotton 
production at 14 million bales analysts say even severe drought 
damage wouldnt reduce the oversupply 
we could lose 2 million bales and not be hurt said ed 
whitten cotton specialist with balfour maclaine corp in new york 
so why did nearmonth cotton futures follow the soybean markets 
sharp springtime surge rallying from about 60 cents a pound on 
april 15 to almost 70 cents by june 20 
cotton very often is called soybeans little brother 
whitten said it follows it slavishly 
added rich cantor cotton analyst with merrill lynch capital 
markets inc it wasnt so much the fabulous buying that brought 
the prices up it was that you didnt have anybody willing to sell 
it that allowed the speculative element to move prices higher in 
tandem with the other markets 
cotton futures prices have since come back down to around 60 
cents a pound 
people finally became convinced the fundamentals had been 
ignored too long said simon 
the inflationsensitive gold market followed a similar albeit 
shorter path in early june gold for august delivery surged above 
its recent 440to460 trading range to more than 470 a troy 
ounce the accepted explanation was that traders feared the sharp 
rise in grain prices would lead to greater inflation 
those worries were quickly calmed by economists who pointed out 
the miniscule impact of food prices on the consumer price index 
and gold prices eased back into their wellworn trading range 
the soybean market and the rally we had in previous weeks 
certainly constituted a psychological inducement to rally the 
precious metals but in general you have to keep the advance in 
perspective said george anagnos metals analyst with thomson 
mckinnon securities inc in new york 
the gold market indicated that foodinspired increases 
alone were not going to boost inflation rates to dangerously high 
levels 
in fact commodity markets almost never take their direction 
from a single source and singleday moves often have no easy 
explanation said steve chronowitz director of futures research 
for smith barney harris upham amp co in new york 
the media naturally wants to know why gold is up a dollar 
today or why its down a dollar he said sometimes there is no 
reason but when theyre at a loss to explain a move analysts will 
tend to tie it to something else

after a long break from inflation the united 
states is entering the early phase of a new cycle of quickly rising 
prices some economists now say 
a resurgence of inflation may take a year or more but if it 
does set in again it might not be stoppable by anything short of a 
governmentinduced recession these economists say 
the us economy has defied expectations of trouble many times 
before during this record nearly 6yearlong expansion and it may 
do so again 
the bond market which is the most sensitive barometer of 
inflation has been fairly calm lately interest rates are down 
from their highs of late may 
but inflation alarms went up friday when the government reported 
that the nations civilian unemployment rate fell to 53 percent in 
june its lowest level in 14 years 
the report added to inflationary concerns caused by the 
exportled boom in manufacturing which has resulted in bottlenecks 
and spotty shortages meanwhile industrial commodity prices have 
jumped 25 percent in the past two years 
a low jobless rate means employers are having trouble finding 
and keeping qualified workers by the laws of supply and demand 
that means wages could start rising rapidly 
american workers have been tolerating low wage increases for so 
long that some economists have concluded that they have permanently 
lowered their expectations 
in the last year for example wages rose 32 percent failing 
to keep up with a roughly 44 percent increase in consumer prices 
in june the average hourly wage rate in private industry was no 
higher than the may rate 927 an hour 
at some point though the tables are likely to turn workers 
will be in such demand that they will be able to insist on pay 
increases that help them catch up or at least stop falling farther 
behind 
and since wage costs account for about 55 percent of the cost of 
production big pay increases could push the economy into an 
inflationary cycle 
kenneth goldstein labor economist for the conference board 
says the startling june jobless rate is probably a quirk caused 
by an underestimate of the size of the labor force he says there 
is no strong evidence of a tight labor market 
but lacy hunt chief economist of the cmampm group said wages 
are slow to react but when they turn they turn decisively and 
rapidly and then theyre hard to contain 
hunt was the most pessimistic on inflation of 32 economists 
included in a forecasting chart published last week by the wall 
street journal predicting an inflation rate of 68 percent in the 
first half of 1989 
still even economists who are relatively optimistic say the 
situation is worsening there are a lot of little pieces of 
evidence that inflation is starting to accelerate said nancy 
lazar an economist for cj lawrence morgan grenfell inc 
the drop in the dollar from its 1985 peak has created strong 
demand for americanmade products and strained the production 
capacity of us factories the dollars recent rise could take off 
some of the edge but it may not last 
adding to the strain is the huge federal budget deficit which 
has become more of a problem now that the economy is already in 
danger of overheating when the government spends more than it 
takes in it can overstimulate an economy that is barely coping 
with strong private demand 
hunt said the government should try to slash the federal deficit 
to less than 100 billion in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 but 
realistically expects the gap to spread to as much as 180 billion 
with government spending out of control the only remedy for 
inflation is on the supply side the federal reserve not known for 
its finesse would have to cool off the economy by jacking up 
interest rates very likely choking off the historic expansion 
hunt said 
were in the early stages of an insurgence of inflation 
hunt said this is the equivalent of the vietnam inflation of the 
mid60s the early stages of the nixon inflation of late 72 and 
the early stages of the carter inflation around 1977 or 1978

though the stock market has rallied since late 
spring wall street is still having trouble working up much 
excitement over what president reagan has labeled a banner year 
for peace and prosperity 
the occasion for reagans statement was a labor department 
report friday that the civilian unemployment rate fell threetenths 
of a percentage point in june to a 14year low of 53 percent 
that figure and the accompanying news of a 346000 increase in 
nonfarm payroll employment far exceeded advance estimates on wall 
street 
the dramatic numbers seemed to leave the stock market with a 
clearly defined choice either it could jump ahead on the evidence 
of solid economic growth or it could drop sharply amid the 
inflation fears that have been raised by many other favorable 
economic reports of late 
as it turned out however the market did neither of those 
things instead it spent the day drifting quietly lower almost as 
though there was no news of any note to deal with 
one primary source of caution in the financial markets of late 
has been a widespread suspicion that the state of the economy is 
too good to last 
before long many investors fear strong growth will bring with 
it increased inflation and upward pressure on interest rates 
indeed rates moved up significantly on friday after the employment 
statistics were issued 
to some analysts this amounts to nothing more than the latest 
of a series of false inflation scares that have hit the markets in 
recent years 
yes they say the rise of the consumer price index in 1988 is 
likely to be a little larger than it was last year with production 
closer to full capacity and special influences like the drought in 
the farm belt 
but no they argue inflation is not about to reach the point 
where it forces stringent credittightening by the federal reserve 
and brings an end to the economic expansion 
the economic cycle will last longer than any investors 
expect maintains donald carver at centre square investment group 
in philadelphia 
peak earnings are still several quarters away inflationary 
pressures from some commodity prices are offset by weakness in 
energy 
interest rates are unlikely anytime soon to reach levels

susan berge kent at tucker anthony amp rl day inc takes a 
different slant on the inflation debate she regards fears of 
upward pressure on prices as misguided but thinks the stock market 
is headed for trouble anyway 
ms kent argues that the basic question facing the stock market 
is how the nation will deal with the greatest debt problem this 
country has faced since the late 1920s 
since the early 1980s she says deflation has been a 
greater risk than inflation particularly in light of the debt 
problem 
but in her view fears of inflation could lead policymakers 
notably the federal reserve board to take actions that would turn 
many heavy debtors into bankrupts 
she concludes the risk is that the fed will tighten raise 
the discount rate at a time when free market forces are already 
pulling in the direction of deflation rather than inflation

droves of teenagers on summer employment rolls helped push the 
nations unemployment rate to a 14year low in june but the news 
rekindled inflation fears and sent stock and bond prices tumbling 
the labor department reported friday before trading began on 
wall street that the unemployment rate for june stood at 53 
percent 
the unexpectedly strong report sent the dow jones average of 30 
industrials down 1654 points to a close at 210615 in light 
trading 
concern that inflation might rise as the economy heats up also 
rippled through the credit markets where the treasurys bellwether 
30year issue fell about 10 per 1000 in face value its yield 
jumped to 909 percent from 900 percent late thursday 
but the unemployment report was welcomed in the currency 
markets where the dollar jumped despite central bank intervention 
traders reasoned that a big reported rise in manufacturing 
employment was an indication that exports remained strong which 
could help shrink the trade deficit and support the dollar 
the labor department said the sharp drop from mays 56 percent 
jobless rate was caused by a seasonally adjusted surge of 820000 
people threefourths of them youths 16 to 24 years old onto the 
nations payrolls 
joblessness among black youths plummeted more than 6 percentage 
points to its lowest level on record

number of available summer jobs especially in the tourist 
industry as foreigners taking advantage of the devalued dollar 
flock to the united states for their vacations 
in other economic developments friday

their installment borrowing at a modest annual rate of 46 percent 
in may as growth in consumer credit slowed from the rapid

off in may compared with net growth of 385 billion in april

oil futures gave up some of their recent gains 
as dealers reassessed the impact of the recent north sea oil rig 
explosion on petroleum supplies and prospects for an emergency opec 
meeting diminished 
it may be a case of calmer heads prevailing today peter 
beutel an oil analyst with elders futures inc said of fridays 
trading session 
prices for petroleum futures and contracts for refined products 
had soared on thursday as traders reacted to reports that the 
scotland rig explosion would affect about 12 percent of total north 
sea production or as much as 300000 barrels of oil per day 
in addition there was concern that the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries might call an emergency meeting to 
discuss overproduction among some of its members 
i think they overreacted to the effects of the platform fire 
and they realized it really didnt mean that much and the gains 
were given back said james r steele an energy analsyt with 
refco inc i think the market also realized there wasnt going to 
be an emergency meeting 
as a result he said fridays trading was highlighted by 
profittaking and a general correction from thursdays overbought 
condition 
on the new york mercantile exchange the contract for august 
delivery of west texas intermediate crude oil fell 37 cents to 
1546 per 42gallon barrel after closing 47 cents higher on 
thursday the contract had traded well above 16 during that 
session 
among refined products traded on the exchange home heating oil 
fell 090 cent to 4339 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline rose 005 cent to 5317 cents a gallon 
analysts attributed the slight rise to reports of strong seasonal 
demand
