vastly improved and giving the thumbsup sign to her hospital 
nurse sunday following a neardrowning in her swimming pool 
shes in good spirits now because she knows shes going to get 
well said dr william j deaton a lung specialist treating ms 
jordan 
shes emotional about that and a little bit tearyeyed some of 
the time knowing what shes been through and how close she came to 
a real catastrophic event but she still also has her jovial 
personality she was joking a little bit this morning deaton 
said she is vastly improved 
ms jordans condition was upgraded from critical to serious but 
stable and she continued to improve sunday night 
she started her liquid diet tonight she is breathing on her 
own she is receiving supplemental oxygen though hospital 
spokeswoman kari larsen said 
ms jordan 52 who gained national attention during the nixon 
impeachment hearings was flown by emergency helicopter to 
brackenridge hospital on saturday after she was found floating 
facedown in her pool 
deaton said she came within four to five minutes 10 minutes 
at most of suffering severe brain damage and possibly death 
ms jordan apparently lost consciousness while in the pool 
deaton and dr james little a neurologist said it isnt known 
what caused her to lose consciousness but that the lack of oxygen 
then caused cardiac arrest 
ms jordan had been in critical condition in the hospitals 
intensive care unit but deaton said sunday afternoon that shes 
upgraded now shes certainly stable in a much less serious 
condition 
ms jordan was breathing without the aid of a mechanical 
ventilator responding to questions and trying to make sure a 
monday dental appointment was canceled she obviously has pretty 
good mental recall if thats her biggest concern deaton said 
right now i think things look very good that shell get 
totally back to normal little said shes very close to normal 
right now i think she will continue to improve as best as i can 
tell right now she probably will regain full mental functions 
the doctors said ms jordan who has used a wheelchair for 
several years suffers from multiple sclerosis but her condition 
shouldnt have had an effect on the incident 
she has muscle weakness and it would be difficult for her to 
rescue herself from the swimming pool if she had any warning of any 
event i doubt though based on the suddenness of the event 
that she had any warning deaton said 
little said possible causes for her losing consciousness were a 
sudden heartbeat irregularity or a seizure but hospital tests 
showed her cardiac status has been very stable shes had no 
evidence of seizure activity he said 
ms jordan delivered a nominating speech for vice presidential 
candidate sen lloyd bentsen of texas at the democratic national 
convention in atlanta bentsen telephoned a message to ms jordan

rostow a former aide to president lyndon johnson university of 
texas womens basketball coach jody conradt plus ms jordans two 
sisters and livein companion nancy earl who found ms jordan in 
the pool 
ms jordan is a fan of the university of texas lady longhorns 
and nurse barbara tucker said the basketball teams former star 
fran harris visited before leaving for the olympic trials 
when i remember seeing ms jordan on tv i frequently remember 
the thumbsup sign that things are ok shes probably given me that 
about 20 times today ms tucker said 
ms jordan in 1966 became the first black state senator in texas 
history in 1972 she was the first southern black elected to 
congress since reconstruction serving until 1978 when she left

arkansas gov bill clinton has gone 
from the media doghouse to media darling in one short week and all 
it took was a smile a few selfdeprecating jokes and a song 
clinton panned for a democratic convention speech that seemed 
like the last word in boredom when he nominated michael dukakis for 
president has apparently made a comeback with his appearance 
thursday with johnny carson on the tonight show 
cable news network on friday cited the governor for the 
fastest turnaround ever on its weekly winners and losers 
clinton considered a rising political star had been the big 
loser the previous week for his july 20 speech clinton proved 
that being a good sport is the first step to political 
rehabilitation said frederick allen a cnn political analyst 
clinton traded quips with carson and confided that his 35minute 
nomination speech which was interrupted by chants and less polite 
suggestions that he stop was actually designed to make dukakis 
look good 
he also took a turn on the saxophone doing a passable rendition 
of summertime with doc severinson and the nbc orchestra 
people who watch television love this kind of comeback story 
he was so boyish and charming im sure he won a lot of hearts 
said tom shales syndicated television critic for the washington 
post 
ej dionne national political writer for the new york times 
said it may well be that clinton had a bigger audience on johnny 
carson than he had at the convention 
not everybody was watching though dukakis missed the 
broadcast but mark gearan dukakis press secretary said he did 
get favorable reports 
it came as no surprise to him that gov clinton went out of 
the ballpark gearan said

trust a knievel to want to jump just a 
little farther 
robbie knievel son of stunt legend evel knievel sailed over 22 
cars on his motorcycle let go of the handlebars for a blink and 
landed more than halfway down a 100foot ramp by his own estimate 
it was about a 26car sail 
my gap here was about 140 feet knievel said after the jump 
saturday at portland international raceway i might have gone 
about 170 feet actually i wanted to clear the whole ramp 
knievel teased the crowd with three practice passes at the 
takeoff ramp climbed it once slowly for a last look then 
retreated after a pause for effect he gunned his dirt bike for 
the takeoff 
knievel guessed that he was going about 75 mph when he hit the 
ramp 
usually you know about halfway across whether youre going to 
make it or not and about then i knew i was going to be all 
right he said but i thought i was getting back too far and i 
didnt want to flip over thats why i only let go for a little 
bit 
evel knievel who suffered a total of 35 broken bones during his 
daredevil career said he had never cleared more than 21 cars 
during his career he says his son is a far better jumper than he 
ever was 
it felt really good robbie knievel said

us courthouse here is a room number scratched in black pen above 
a door frame 
inside there are no plaques no citations no personal 
photographs of a man once described as a more powerful influence on 
the law than president reagan or chief justice william h rehnquist 
very few people find me over here which i regard as a plus 
says lewis f powell who retired from the us supreme court one 
year ago 
powell was often seen during the 1980s as the justice who kept 
the court from drifting too far left or right but he takes a 
modest view of his role 
if i got into a footnote id be surprised powell said 
although he cited age and declining health when he retired hes 
maintaining a full schedule 
his idea of retirement is to stop working at 4 oclock on 
saturday afternoon said robert r merhige jr a us district 
judge and longtime friend 
since he retired powell has sat with appellate court 
panels taught at the university of virginia and delivered 
commencement addresses at george mason university and washington 
and lee 
powell 80 said he has had no regrets about retirement he and 
his wife josephine have four children and seven grandchildren 
when you reach my ancient age family is far more important 
than any of the less personal things that happen to one over a long 
lifetime he said

new government statistics have revived the 
debate over whether the evil inflation monster which terrorized 
america during the 1970s is starting to awaken after having slept 
for most of this decade 
the reagan administration mindful of how voters perceptions 
will affect the presidential race insists there are no signs that 
inflation is becoming a problem but many private economists 
disagree 
these economists contend that the 68month economic expansion 
now the second longest of the postworld war ii period has used up 
all of the economys slack capacity 
tight labor markets and high factory operating rates are 
beginning to be translated into accelerating wage demands and 
higher prices they believe 
proponents of this theory received more ammunition last week 
with two new government reports one on wage increases and the 
other on overall economic growth and inflation 
the wage report showed that compensation for american workers 
wages and fringe benefits such as health insurance and pensions 
was rising this year at the highest rate since the summer of 1985 
wages and benefits which represent about twothirds of all 
business costs climbed by 45 percent in the 12month period 
ending in june compared with an increase of just 3 percent in the 
prior 12 months 
in a second report the government said an inflation index tied 
to the gross national product shot up at an annual rate of 47 
percent from april through june the fastest pace in almost six 
years the big jump in prices was blamed on higher consumer costs 
for food clothing and energy 
to the administration these reports were not cause for concern 
beryl sprinkel the presidents chief economic adviser blamed 
the inflation spurt on temporary factors including the drought and 
higher import costs because of the weaker dollar he insisted that 
there was no evidence that the economy was being overtaken by a new 
wageprice spiral 
we remain convinced that inflation will continue under 
restraint he told reporters during a briefing 
some private economists agree contending that inflationary 
pressures from the drought and tight labor markets are being offset 
by weakness in oil prices and a rebound in the dollar which 
reduces the costs of imports 
they note that the consumer price index after registering big 
jumps in the early spring calmed down in may and june only 03 
percent during the first six months of the year consumer prices 
rose 44 percent identical to the inflation rate for all of 1987 
i dont think we are seeing signs of higher inflation ahead 
said michael evans head of a washington consulting firm the 
rise in energy and clothing prices in the spring has since been 
reversed 
but this view is disputed by other private analysts who argue 
that inflation has once again become a threat for the first time 
since the early 1980s when the fight to reduce doubledigit 
inflation rates led to the steep 198182 recession 
the pickup in inflation is worrisome and is likely to continue 
through the end of the year raising the possibility of a slowdown 
in growth in 1989 said jerry jasinowski chief economist of the 
national association of manufacturers 
other analysts raise the possibility of an outright recession 
beginning next year the federal reserve since march has been 
taking a series of steps to push interest rates higher in an effort 
to ease inflationary pressures by dampening demand 
while this is the classic recipe for starting a recession 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has maintained that a 
downturn can be avoided if the central bank acts quickly at the 
first sign of inflation when the amount of credit restraint needed 
is still small 
but david wyss an economist with data resources inc said the 
fed may have already waited too long 
the pattern is that the fed always waits too long to act then 
it clamps down too hard and causes a recession he said 
wyss said the fed has been hesitant about moving too quickly 
because this is a presidential election year and big interestrate 
boosts would not be viewed favorably by the administration in its 
efforts to keep the white house in republican hands 
as a result wyss predicted that consumer prices would rise at 
around 55 percent annual rate next year which would be the 
fastest inflation clip since an 89 percent rise in 1981 
alan sinai chief economist of the boston co said one of the 
problems is that demand pressures are outstripping the countrys 
ability to produce the goods and services 
we are starting to see a situation where we have too many 
dollars chasing too few goods he said once the economy runs 
out of slack we often get a credit crunch which ultimately leads 
to a recession

astronauts on the first 
postchallenger shuttle flight may grow crystals of a protein taken 
from the aids virus in an experiment researchers hope will lead to 
drugs to fight the fatal disease 
the protein reverse transcriptase is an enzyme the aids virus 
uses to replicate its genetic material in order to reproduce and 
spread through the body said dr charles bugg a university of 
alabamabirmingham researcher 
aids would never infect human cells without using this 
enzyme said bugg coordinator for nasa of protein experiments 
that are to be conducted aboard discovery the shuttle is scheduled 
to fly later this year 
researchers want to grow the crystals of reverse transcriptase 
to decipher its structure crystals grown in space are not 
distorted by gravity while they form 
scientists hope to learn how the aids virus takes over the 
genetic machinery inside a cell and use that knowledge to develop a 
drug to conquer aids 
dr tom krenitsky at burroughs wellcome in research triangle 
park nc developed the experiment nasa is making sure it meets 
safety guidelines 
we want to make sure there is no danger of infection to the 
crew with just this protein bugg said 
jim ball a nasa spokesman in washington said the review would 
take several weeks 
krenitsky predicted that if the shuttle is launched in september 
and the experiment works well researchers could have a model of 
the proteins structure by the end of the year but he cautioned it 
could take 10 years to make a new aids drug 
its still very much an experimental program but one that we 
feel is full of promise he said 
discovery is in the middle of a simulated countdown leading up 
to a crucial testfiring of its main engines to test modifications 
the countdown was interrupted friday because of problems with 
ground fueling equipment and the firing was postponed from monday 
until thursday 
nasa officials so far have found no evidence to suggest the 
experiment could infect any of the astronauts with aids krenitsky 
said thursday that it even if the protein somehow got into an 
astronauts bloodstream it would not infect him 
first of all you only have one of 20 to 30 proteins the virus 
needs to be a viable organism krenitsky said its such a 
small piece its not workable

behind the arguments about various childcare 
proposals the real winners are working mothers whose problems are 
getting unprecedented attention on the presidential campaign trail 
and on capitol hill 
although theres no certainty that congress will enact such 
legislation this year given the little time left on the 
electionyear legislative calendar both democrat michael dukakis 
and republican george bush have latched onto the issue 
passage of legislation more comprehensive than the current 
patchwork of federal childcare policies therefore seems 
inevitable 
helen blank director of child care at the childrens defense 
fund says she couldnt be more pleased 
the landscape is changing both demographically and 
politically she said families need child care theyve waited 
a long time to turn any attention to this issue clearly both 
candidates have an interest and both candidates understand the 
need for new significant resources 
in fact both bush and dukakis visited daycare centers last 
week 
dukakis the democratic presidential nominee and bush his 
certain republican opponent favor rival childcare approaches so 
the issue is sure to remain in public view as the general election 
campaign unfolds 
the daycare visits seemed tacit recognition by the two men of a 
new american social norm documented recently by the census bureau 
more than half of new mothers go back to work before their children 
are a year old 
bush is proposing a 22 billion program of tax credits for 
working parents while dukakis is backing a 25 billion childcare 
bill in congress 
the obvious concern displayed by bush and dukakis plus the 
surprisingly high dollar commitment in bushs proposal are fueling 
optimism that a comprehensive childcare bill may be enacted this 
year 
apparently were not arguing money anymore an ebullient 
sen christopher dodd dconn said after bush made his proposal 
were all agreed weve got to do something about child care 
were all agreed that its going to cost a lot of money dodd 
said 
the connecticut democrat is chief sponsor of the 25 billion 
act for better child care services 
dukakis has endorsed the democratic initiative in principle the 
legislation won senate committee approval last week and is 
tentatively scheduled for action this week in the house education 
and labor committee 
the bill reserves 75 percent of its money to help low and 
middleincome parents pay for day care at homes and centers that 
meet minimum federal safety and staffing standards states could 
use the rest of the money for capital improvements daycare staff 
training and salaries and administrative costs 
the approach differs substantially from the one that bush has 
proposed the vice presidents daycare program would be built 
around a tax credit of up to 1000 for lowincome families for 
each child under 4 even if one parent in the family was staying 
home to take care of the child 
the largest existing government program is the dependentcare 
tax credit for dualearner families who pay for child care it 
costs the department of the treasury about 4 billion a year in 
lost revenue 
according to blank other government childcare programs include 
a 27 billion social services block grant to states of which less 
than 20 percent is used for day care and a 600 million food 
program that helps daycare homes and centers provide nutritious 
meals 
welfare parents in job training programs or jobs that dont pay 
enough for them to leave the rolls are also entitled to some help 
with childcare expenses 
the bush bill endorsed in general terms by president reagan 
would depart from current policy by giving tax breaks to families 
with a spouse at home families not eligible for the existing 
dependent care tax credit 
at least four republicansponsored bills pending in congress 
take the same approach conservatives support it as a way to 
eliminate what they see as tax discrimination against mothers who 
decide to stay home with their children 
but citizens for tax justice a laborbacked tax study group 
said the bills are unfair and unlikely to help those most in need 
since lowincome families can least afford to have one parent stay 
at home 
backers of the democratic initiative say a universal tax break 
for families with preschool children is no substitute for their 
bill 
they argue that a 1000 tax credit would pay for only a third 
of the cost of one childs annual day care and after the fact 
they say a simple tax credit does not address the uneven quality of 
day care 
conservatives criticize the democrats bill on two major points 
its cost and the federal daycare standards it sets but bushs 
plan and a recent house gop initiative with a 13 billion price 
tag may blunt the controversy over spending 
that leaves federal standards for childcare as the primary 
sticking point 
sen strom thurmond rsc summing up the conservative view 
during committee discussion of the democratic bill said it has 
not been established in my mind that state and local governments 
need to be guided by the superior wisdom from washington 
dodd and childrens defense fund officials say national 
standards are critical 
this is a linchpin of dodds bill blank said 
clearly this is not a regional issue she said infants 
have the same needs no matter what state theyre located in a 
child caregiver with no training has no training no matter where 
she resides

the resignation of italys top investigator of the 
mafia has shaken public confidence in the governments battle with 
the mob and prompted fears about a new wave of corruption in sicily 
giovanni falcone and eight other investigating magistrates who 
played a prominent role in italys largest mafia trial resigned 
saturday the socalled maxitrial ended in december with 
convictions of 338 mafiosi including 19 reputed members of the 
cosa nostras leadership commission 
the nine magistrates of the antimafia pool in sicily 
submitted their resignations to the superior council of 
magistrates which oversees italian judges and asked to be 
transferred to other posts 
falcone gave several reasons for the action including what he 
called obstruction of mafia investigations on the island of sicily 
in a letter to the council falcone cited ommissions and 
inertia in the fight against organized crime that which i 
feared could happen unfortunately happened the investigations into 
the mafia have been obstructed and the antimafia pool is now 
stalled 
falcone also said in the letter that he wanted to leave his job 
so he could testify freely before a rome inquiry into mafia 
investigations 
the council of magistrates has been holding an inquiry into 
statements by the prosecutor of the sicilian city of marsala paolo 
borsellino that state and local officials curbed the power of the 
antimafia group 
palermos mayor said falcones resignation could mark a return 
to the days when sicilian authorities and politicians conspired 
with the mob 
we have weeded out corrupt politicians or those who were in 
some way accomplices of the mafia the mayor leoluca orlando 
said in an interview with the staterun rai television saturday 
night 
today he said we are worried that there can be a return 
to the past a return to the years in which magistrates policemen 
and politicians were in collusion with the mafia i wouldnt want 
to return to the past 
ten days ago borsellino caused a national uproar when he 
charged that authorities had gone soft on the mafia since the 
maxitrial and that state and local officials had curbed the 
power of the magistrates 
the charges prompted president francesco cossiga to dispatch 
national police officials to palermo to examine the situation he 
also ordered the inquiry by the national judges council in rome 
in his letter to the council falcone also said his methods 
differ radically with those of his new superior antonino meli 
meli was appointed overseeing magistrate in february despite 
objections by falcone that he had no experience in mafia probes 
falcone said his resignation should be seen as the profound 
unease of one who must perform a delicate job in unfavorable 
conditions and the desire to express freely my thoughts without any 
conditions 
the antimafia pool was put together in 1983 after an 
investigator was killed in palermo the team worked under heavy 
security and devoted attention to fighting the mafia 
the magistrates were the first to take advantage of new laws to 
examine bank accounts of anyone suspected of mafia association the 
information was used successfully in trials of suspected mafia drug 
traffickers 
falcone won the cooperation of tomasso buscetta a mafia leader 
who broke the mobs code of silence to describe its command 
structure in the 1987 trial 
falcone has become a national symbol of italys war on organized 
crime and is considered its top investigator of the mafia

tennessee eagle no 3 
looked glum 
in just two hours the baby bald eagle had been plucked from its 
nest in a tall spruce lowered to the ground in a sack put in a 
portable dog pen and ferried on a bouncing skiff to a us fish and 
wildlife service vessel 
the bird was to become one of more than 300 bald eagles captured 
in alaska and relocated in other states in an effort to replenish 
the threatened national symbol 
bald eagles an endangered species in every other state because 
of lead poisoning pollution and other manmade dangers are 
abundant in southeast alaska numbering about 12000 at biologists 
last count about the number in all the other states combined 
the region has become the stocking ground for eaglerecovery 
programs in five states 
the demand for birds is getting so great the supply cant meet 
the demand and alaskas been a great bonanza for us said robert 
d smith of the tennessee wildlife resources agency which hopes to 
release 60 bald eagles by 1990 
including 46 exported this year alaska has contributed 264 bald 
eagles for relocation in new york indiana missouri north 
carolina and tennessee said mike jacobson of the us fish and 
wildlife service in juneau 
from 1980 to 1987 400 eagles from alaska and elsewhere were 
relocated in more than a dozen states authorities say 
sightings of birds and nests make biologists confident the 
program is succeeding though they wont have statistical proof for 
a few years 
an eagle expedition begins with timeconsuming helicopter 
surveys fish and wildlife workers fly over some 200 miles of 
coastline each spring plotting nests though eagle nests often 
span 8 feet or more the sticks grass and other matter theyre 
made of camouflage them in the rain forest 
come july biologists from other states fly in and board two 
65foot military surplus vessels run by the fish and wildlife 
service the capture area is a halfdays cruise away in the middle 
of the tongass national forest 
once there tennessee conservationist kevin schutt and fellow 
treescaler dave evans climb to the nests 
while they ascend the adult birds fly in agitated circles or 
perch in trees nearby keening and trilling and shy away from the 
climber and his assistants the young birds dont resist 
eagles theyre pretty docile said schutt 
i dont think theyve climbers ever been struck on this 
project it would be kind of unnerving to be 80 feet up a tree and 
struck by a bird thats 12 to 14 pounds said fish and wildlifes 
phil schempf 
though the young eagles appear nearly fullsize when theyre 
captured at 6 to 7 weeks of age their feathers are soft and their 
bodies unprepared for flight they usually begin flying at 10 to 12 
weeks 
they dont gain the characteristic white head and tail feathers 
until they are 3 or 4 years old and their immature plummage varies 
from dark brown to mottled brown and white 
caretakers band their legs for identification and dust them with 
flea powder to kill feather lice 
once powdered measured and recorded the eagles ride out the 
trip in relative comfort dining twice daily on diced halibut and 
snapper they quickly adapt a tidynest instinct in their cages 
ejecting their refuse through the doors onto the deck and hapless 
deckhands 
once the capture quota is met the eagles are taken to juneau 
and the next stage of their travel aboard commercial airliners

foreign investment in the united states is 
expected to accelerate dramatically this year but the true scope 
of overseas ownership remains hidden a congressional critic 
complains 
we need to know if foreign ownership is concentrating itself 
in key areas of our economy energy steel banking whether 
foreign ownership is gaining control of key sectors of the american 
economy says rep john bryant dtexas 
bryant came into the spotlight last year as sponsor of a 
provision of the 1000page trade bill approved by the house it 
would have forced a major increase in the amount of disclosure 
required of foreign investors 
lawmakers eventually dropped bryants heavily debated plan in an 
unsuccessful effort to win president reagans approval and it is 
not part of the revised version of the trade bill now under debate 
but bryant is still pushing legislation to require foreign 
owners to register their major us assets with the commerce 
department including business industrial real estate and farm 
holdings 
the reagan administration opposes his bill because they dont 
want to look like the folks that gave away the store the dallas 
democrat said 
prospects for getting the bill to the presidents desk this year 
are not especially bright but bryant vows not to give up 
to bolster his case he cites a private study released last week 
showing foreign ownership in the united states more than tripled 
since 1980 
the congressional economic leadership institute said foreign 
investors own about 33 percent of prime commercial real estate in 
washington dc 46 percent in los angeles and 39 percent in 
houston 
it said they own 10 percent of the us manufacturing base hold 
a majority interest in concrete and consumer electronics 
industries and a significant portion in machine tools chemicals 
and auto parts 
nearly 3 million americans are employed full or parttime as a 
result of foreign investment the study said 
it acknowledged however that foreign investments still account 
for no more than 5 percent to 6 percent of us assets 
bryant said it is foolhardy to believe foreign investors 
will avoid the united states if they must register their holdings 
because every other country collects careful data without 
scaring off business 
nancy leamond president of the institute said in our 
innermost circle of trading partners we are the only nation that 
swings the door open unconditionally to virtually every 
investment 
treasury secretary james a baker iii and former cabinet 
official elliot richardson claim bryants bill is anticompetitive 
richardson testified before the senate commerce committee that 
it would discourage foreign investment and result in higher us 
interest rates and an economic slowdown 
richardson called the reporting requirements burdensome he said 
sufficient data already have been collected by 16 federal agencies 
and that investors would have to reveal business secrets 
in its study the institute said an unprecedented transfer of 
american assets to foreign control is under way 
since 1980 foreign direct investment in the united states 
expanded by more than 215 percent while american investment abroad

ray blanton former congressman 
exgovernor and onetime inmate at a us penitentiary is hoping 
for a big sympathy vote as he bids for political resurrection in 
thursdays democratic primary for congress 
blanton who left the governors office in 1979 in a swirl of 
controversy over the sale of pardons and state liquor licenses 
said he expects voters to see that he was a victim of political 
persecution 
they know i was railroaded and falsely accused he said 
blanton faces three primary opponents in tennessees 8th 
district a largely rural area that borders the mississippi river 
and runs from just north of memphis to the kentucky state line 
the favorite state rep john tanner has the support of ed 
jones the districts popular outgoing congressman and has raised 
more than 450000 to blantons 25000 
ive got a million dollars worth of name recognition which i 
have earned over the years blanton said i havent gone out 
begging and havent held any armtwisting fundraisers 
blanton won some of that recognition when he was unceremoniously 
dumped from the governors office before his term expired in 
january 1979 
fellow democrats swore in republican lamar alexander three days 
early after blanton abruptly pardoned three former felons and 
commuted the sentences of 49 inmates most of them armed robbers 
and murderers 
the pardon scandal in which two of blantons aides were 
convicted of taking bribes to free prisoners became the subject of 
the movie marie starring sissy spacek 
blanton was never charged in that scandal but he was convicted 
in federal court in 1981 of taking part in a scheme to sell state 
liquor licenses 
the conviction was on charges of conspiracy extortion and mail 
fraud the fraud conviction was overturned after his release from 
prison because of a us supreme court ruling on the definition of 
the offense a state court restored his citizenship rights last 
year 
blanton who represented the states 7th district in congress 
from 1967 to 1972 and was tennessees chief executive from 1975 to 
1979 is running on a platform of government experience and fair 
play 
theres a large silent vote that we still feel will come down 
on my side he said 
jones who has represented the district without serious 
opposition since 1969 said he has known tanner all his life and 
has followed his 12year career in the legislature 
i might have retired two years ago but he wasnt ready 
jones said from his office in washington 
the other democrats in the race are jackson mayor bob conger and 
ivy scarborough a jackson lawyer 
the race has produced few fireworks or sharp differences on 
issues the candidates promised to help create jobs protect the 
family farm improve education and oppose drug dealers 
none has seriously attacked blanton in public for his prison 
record but tanner has been criticized as too well financed and 
tied to the districts political establishment 
three republicans are running in the gop primary

newspapers on sunday condemned 
the governments ban on cry freedom and said the antiapartheid 
film could help south africans confront and address their deep 
racial divisions 
the movie tells the story of black south african activist steve 
biko who died in police detention in 1977 and white journalist 
donald woods who befriended him 
the film was approved by government censors friday morning and 
immediately began playing in 30 theaters nationwide however 
police seized the film seven hours later saying it was 
contributing to the revolutionary climate in south africa 
south africans have been reminded anew that the government 
wants to decide for them what they should see think feel the 
independent sunday star said in an editorial 
the central point about cry freedom is whether south 
africans are mature enough to confront a substantially accurate and 
thoroughly discomfiting piece of recent history the star said 
we think they are 
during the films brief run three bombs exploded at theaters 
where the movie was shown and there were several bomb threats 
there were no injuries on saturday a bomb blast at a shopping 
area in a white suburb outside johannesburg killed one woman and 
injured 56 
police cited the theater attacks as proof that the controversial 
film was a threat to public safety never before has a film shown 
in south africa contained such emotional and violent scenes related 
to the governments apartheid policies 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the nations 26 million blacks have no voice in 
national affairs the countrys 5 million whites control the 
economy and maintain separate residential areas schools and health 
services 
the banning is an act of a desperate government whose thoughts 
are clouded with fear and uncertainty said the blackoriented 
city press we are dealing with certain government officials who 
do not have the slightest idea of the basic tenets of freedom of 
thought and expression 
the independent sunday times the countrys largest sunday 
newspaper said the government was more worried about the films 
considerable truth than its alleged antisouth africa 
propaganda 
the challenge of cry freedom for whites is to commit 
themselves to redressing those wrongs of racial discrimination 
the sunday times said 
the test for black south africans is to rise above the 
bitterness and take up the task of constructive participation 
in building a better south africa it added 
the sunday times and the sunday star both ran frontpage stories 
suggesting that international distributors of movies and television 
programs could face increased pressure to pull out of south africa 
following the ban on cry freedom

secretary of state george shultz said sunday 
he would be willing to meet with irans foreign minister if a 
meeting were requested 
shultz in an interview on cbstvs face the nation 
indicated direct usiranian talks could include discussions about 
an end to the iraniraq war terrorism and hostagetaking but not 
the return of iranian assets which is being handled by an 
international court 
shultz said us officials are trying to find an authoritative 
channel for direct talks with iran but he has not sought a 
meeting with iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati during the 
iranian officials visit to the united nations for peace talks 
we dont have to go running around after people shultz 
said but he added its important to iran to have a relationship 
with the united states and that will emerge in due time 
asked if he would meet with velayati if such a meeting were 
requested shultz replied sure adding i dont know that 
its necessarily the right way to start to have the foreign 
ministers meet but at any rate we have stated our policy 
he indicated the united states continues to make contacts with 
iran through third countries and said us officials have 
repeatedly expressed a willingness to hold direct talks on what 
it takes for them to become part of the civilized community 
he said if iran will stop the war stop being involved in 
terrorism and stop promoting the taking of hostages then there 
is a prospect of more normal relations with us 
shultz said the issue of releasing nine americans held by 
proiranian groups in lebanon would have to be separate from 
financial and other considerations 
he noted that the issue of releasing iranian assets held by the 
united states is being handled by a claims tribunal court in the 
hague and there is no reason to disrupt it iranian officials 
have suggested they might work for release of the hostages if the 
assets are returned but reagan administration officials have said 
they will make no such deal 
shultz described the us effort to sell arms to iran in 
exchange for the hostages as an aberration and said the united 
states has a constant policy

the grass is green and the crops are 
growing again in southern indiana thanks to rain that fell during 
the past two weeks the moisture has also given new life to the 
hopes of farmers 
everything was brown and then just in a couple of days it 
started greening and it looks like spring now said shirley 
heidrick who farms 750 acres in eastern owen county with her 
husband ron 
the worst drought in decades had dried out the couples fields 
but the recent rain improved chances that they will harvest enough 
corn and soybeans to make the loan payments on the spring planting 
mrs heidrick said 
were doing fine you know things are looking better and we 
just keep working she said 
southcentral indiana got more rain in july most of it in the 
third week than in may and june together the national weather 
service in indianapolis lists july rainfall of 388 inches may and 
june had 142 inches of rain 
milk production is up at jim elliotts owen county dairy farm 
where cows have more grass to eat and his oncedry pond again has 
water 
we just really dont know where we stand right now but it 
dont look near as bleak as it did before it started raining 
elliott said 
i had a lot of corn that was waisthigh before the rain and 
its headhigh now he said on my better soybeans they grew 
something like a footandahalf they were about kneehigh the 
taller ones now theyre up pretty near hiphigh 
janet hasler of southern greene county said the outlook is 
much brighter now than it was three weeks ago when her family 
planned to sell 20 sows and 100 baby feeder pigs because of a lack 
of feed corn 
the rain may have saved enough corn that the cuts wont have to 
be so drastic she said 
the first night it rained don stood outside and watched it 
rain he just stood out on our porch hasler said weve got 
green grass again and the weeds are growing and all of that good 
stuff theres lots of mudholes for the pigs to wallow in it looks 
like a normal summer now 
despite the increased rainfall farmers remain uncertain about 
how they will fare during the winter many face shortages of hay 
and corn to feed their livestock and sharply reduced crop income 
a purdue university agricultural expert says only 9 percent of 
indiana farmers have federal crop insurance 
while the rain halted a steady decline in anticipated yields 
experts dont have enough experience with droughts to know how much 
it will allow crops to recover said terry strueh assistant to 
purdues dean of agriculture 
there are none of us that ever experienced anything like this 
before strueh said last week this is the worst weve ever had 
since we kept records starting about the turn of the century

soviet officials are promising to reveal one 
of their deepest military secrets one that defense minister dmitri 
yazoz says is a mystery even to him the size of the defense budget 
that military budget will again be near the top of the agenda as 
defense secretary frank c carlucci opens his third round of talks 
with yazov in moscow on monday 
soviet defense officials in the past said their annual spending 
was about 20 billion rubles or 33 billion just over onetenth of 
the pentagon budget 
but analysts at the central intelligence agency and pentagon say 
soviet defense spending is close to that of the united states 
accounting for 15 percent to 17 percent of the soviet gross 
national product 
and yazov during his two previous meetings with carlucci has 
pegged soviet defense spending at about 16 percent of gnp very 
close to the us estimate 
we welcome that kind of truth now a senior pentagon 
official said on the eve of carluccis departure for moscow 
but that new candor doesnt substitute for the fact that they 
still dont present a detailed public accurate accounting of what 
their military budget really is and what it goes for said the 
us official speaking on condition of anonymity 
the united states which has an economy estimated at double that 
of the soviet union spent 66 percent of gnp on defense in 1986 
according to us government statistics 
the soviets say they dont know exactly what they are spending 
on defense because their data does not account for weapons 
research development and production which consume more than half 
the pentagon budget nowhere are the soviet numbers pulled together 
and in a country where the government owns all industry the 
soviet military pays artificially low prices for goods that in many 
cases are not even available to civilian factories such as special 
steel alloys 
it is kind of hard for us to believe that they dont know how 
much in detail they spend on military matters but maybe its 
true said the senior pentagon official 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has called for reforms 
throughout society including the military and wants the defense 
ministry to produce a complete and reliable budget ultimately he 
wants to improve the international climate enough to allow him to 
divert resources into the civilian sector 
vadim kuznetsov deputy director of the usa desk at the 
soviet foreign ministry said in a recent interview in moscow that 
his nation would make good on its pledge to publish a detailed 
defense budget by the early 1990s 
in two three or four years we will have much more correct 
figures on military spending said kuznetsov that will take a 
new system of accounting similar to the one in which civilian 
factories must pay their way or shut down rather than exist on 
state subsidies as has been the case 
under the old system a truck could cost many times less for 
the military than for a collective farm because of price 
manipulation said kuznetsov 
when we have price reform the new price will reflect the 
production costs for everybody he said when a truck costs as 
much for a collective farm as it does for the military then we 
will have more accurate figures on military spending 
but soviet military spending will stay below that of america 
said kuznetsov because we have compulsive military service we 
practically pay our soldiers nothing they get some pocket money 
for cigarettes thats all 
in the united states which since 1972 has had an allvolunteer 
military military salaries make up 783 billion of the annual 
pentagon budget of 2893 billion according to defense department 
statistics 
the new soviet accounting method will bolster gorbachevs policy 
of glasnost or greater openness in discussing previously taboo 
subjects 
at public lectures people would ask how with so few rubles in 
the budget we could have military parity with the united states 
which spends 300 billion said kuznetsov 
the financial affairs of the soviet defense ministry always have 
been secret reviewed only by a handful of top kremlin leaders 
now however gorbachev and his allies are calling for greater 
powers for the national parliament the supreme soviet and 
kuznetsov says the day is not too distant when the soviet defense 
minister will be summoned before a legislative committee and asked 
to defend his budget in open session 
even the revised accounting methods being discussed in the 
soviet union may not show the true cost of soviet military 
spending according to andrew marshall head of the pentagons 
office of net assessment 
marshall in an article printed by the congressional joint 
economic committee last november estimated that soviet military 
spending may account for between 20 and 30 percent of gnp 
to reach that total marshall added 
traditionally military spending including personnel weapons 
research and development and the military side of the space 
program 
additional costs such as civil defense and scarce resources 
diverted from civilian industry 
and the cost of external empire costs that are undertaken 
for the purposes of increasing protection of the soviet union 
andor for the expansion of its influence in the world 
even under glasnost soviet officials are only beginning to 
discuss the pricklier aspects of their military spending

jordans king hussein has posed a challenge 
to israel the united states the palestine liberation organization 
and the strength of his own society by loosening jordans ties with 
palestine 
the king on sunday appeared to rule out the idea of jordan 
representing palestinians in any peace talks and said his countrys 
links to palestinians in the occupied territories hamper their 
fight against occupation 
rumors swept amman that further steps were possible perhaps 
replacement of palestinian members of his cabinet 
hussein already dissolved the lower house of parliament where 
30 of the 60 members represented the west bank he also canceled a 
major west bank development project 
but overly strong measures could shake the foundations of a 
kingdom with a majority population of palestinian refugees and 
immigrants tied by blood and bank accounts to the west bank and 
gaza strip 
husseins moves stem from the palestinian uprising on the west 
bank and gaza strip seized from jordan and egypt in the 1967 
middle east war 
protesters there clearly have demonstrated the plos 
overwhelming popularity and jordans relative lack of it 
the arab summit in algiers in june which was called to back the 
uprising placed political and financial control from the outside 
clearly in the plos hands upsetting some jordanian officials who 
argued the arab leaders had ignored jordans historic 
responsibilities to the region 
by stepping back hussein is honoring plo requests but he also 
may be seeking to force the plo and arab leaders to recognize 
jordans crucial role in the occupied lands where most 
palestinians still carry jordanian passports 
for israel and its american supporters it could mean that for 
now there is no viable alternative to dealing with the plo if they 
want peace 
both have shunned the organization claiming it is a terrorist 
body and more significantly fearing its demand for a 
palestinian state on the flank of israel 
both have tried for two decades to force the palestinians under 
jordans wing and to talk peace with jordan without the plo 
but hussein said in algiers he would not negotiate with israel 
over palestine repeating a warning he gave us secretary of state 
george shultz in april 
that leaves shultzs middle east peace effort keyed on jordan 
in limbo 
jordans move also challenges the plo which for more than two 
decades has failed to win open recognition from either america or 
israel 
the plo also must find ways to aid the occupied territories that 
bypass israeli security aimed specifically at halting plo influence 
hoping to encourage moderate jordanian influence israel had 
tacitly cooperated with jordans development plan prior to the 
uprising 
it also gave jordanian parliament members vip treatment crossing 
the usually arduous bridge security after hussein revived 
parliament in 1983 a move criticized at the time by the plo 
the parliament had been dormant since 1974 the year arabs made 
the plo sole representative for palestinians in part because no 
elections could be held on the israelioccupied west bank 
jordan cannot afford to cut too deeply into its ties with 
palestinians they dominate ammans economy and the remittances 
sent to jordan by palestinians in the gulf are its most important 
source of foreign exhange 
most of the 800000 west bank residents still hold jordanian 
passports and about 18000 still receive jordanian salaries 
jordanian money is still common currency jordanian texts are 
used in schools jordanian officials administer hundreds of mosques 
and islamic charities 
until israel choked traffic over the jordan river bridges 
thousands of palestinians crossed weekly to visit family or friends 
and handle bank accounts on either side of the line 
husseins greatgrandfather is buried in jerusalem 
those close ties have made jordan and the plo natural rivals for 
palestinian affections creating distrust that flared into open 
warfare in 1970 
although jordan accepted a 1974 arab summit resolution declaring 
the plo the sole representative of the palestinians it continued 
to insist it had responsibilities for them and under international 
law sovereignty over the west bank 
but the kings palace advisers appeared to be shocked by the 
strength of antijordanian sentiment expressed during the 
8monthold palestinian uprising jordanian backers were often 
harassed and threatened sometimes attacked 
jordanian officials also were knocked politically off balance by 
the uprisinginspired wave of proplo sentiment in the arab world 
following jordanian pressure on the plo to meet american conditions 
for dealing with the organization effective recognition of israel

in the west bank a 19yearold arab was shot in the leg during 
clashes with troops near the city of jenin hospital officials said 
proplo activist faisal husseini who has been described by 
defense minister yitzhak rabin as the top palestine liberation 
organization activist in israeliheld territories was arrested at 
his home in a predawn raid and ordered held for six months without 
trial 
everyone who wants peace is put in jail husseinis wife 
najad told the associated press my husband was speaking about 
peace nothing else 
another leading proplo activist hanna siniora and about a 
dozen members of the peace now movement protested husseinis arrest 
in front of the jerusalem detention center where he was held 
husseinis arrest follows a meeting at a jerusalem theater in 
which he engaged in public dialogue with israeli peace activists 
and moshe amirav a member of prime minister yitzhak shamirs likud 
bloc 
during the session husseini 48 endorsed a document drawn up 
by plo spokesman bassam abu sharif who called for direct talks 
between the plo and israel at an international middle east peace 
conference 
israel has rejected direct dialogue with the plo which it 
considers a terrorist group 
as a palestinian my problem is with the israelis so i must 
speak with them husseini told several hundred israelis 
police accused him of being an activist in plo chairman yasser 
arafats mainstream fatah guerrilla faction and of being involved 
in coordinating inciting and establishing the nearly 
8monthold palestinian uprising ms buton said 
police ordered the closure of the arab studies center in 
jerusalem which husseini directs for one year starting sunday 
charging it was financed by arafats fatah group and was used to 
advance the aims of the uprising which has claimed the lives of 
235 palestinians and four israelis 
mustafa tawfiq abu zahara head of a jerusalem merchants group 
was detained sunday and accused of organizing demonstrations and 
boycotts of israeli products as well as inciting palestinians not 
to pay taxes ms buton said 
she said abu zahara spent 18 months in jail in 1979 on charges 
of helping a convicted terrorist 
husseini has spent 12 of the past 16 months in administrative 
detention 
husseini said an arrest last fall may have been partly the 
result of secret talks he held with amirav in an interview th 
activist suggested his dialogue wednesday with the israelis may 
again have angered authorities 
this may have been one of the reasons i was arrested 
husseini told the associated press 
labor party legislator abba eban sunday criticized the arrest 
i see this as unwise all this game of hideandseek with arab 
leaders eban said in an interview with israel army radio 
israeli authorities are holding about 2500 palestinians without 
trial the majority rounded up since the beginning of the uprising 
in another development police officials confirmed they 
recommended the prosecution of israeli civilians in the shooting 
deaths of three west bank residents 
the statement came in response to a query by leftwing 
legislator dedi zucker on the status of investigations into 13 
palestinian deaths in which israeli civilians were suspected 
police did not say how many israelis could be prosecuted 
police recommended prosecution in the case involving the jan 11 
shooting death of nasser ghanem hammad 17 of the west bank 
village betin said nahum shaked a spokesman for police minister 
chaim barlev 
the report did not name the suspect but police at the time held 
pinhas wallerstein a prominent jewish settler leader for 
questioning the army has said wallerstein opened fire after being 
stoned by palestinian youths but arab witnesses said hammad was 
killed without provocation 
in three other cases police recommended that no charges be 
filed for lack of evidence said shaked

an afghan guerrilla spokesman said 
sunday that guerrillas will release two soviet prisoners of war as 
a gesture of good will 
the news came as the soviet news agency tass reported that 
afghan rebels staged a rocket attack on their capital of kabul 
killing one person and wounding three 
tass quoting afghanistans official bakhtar news agency said 
several houses were damaged by the groundtoground missiles it 
gave no further details 
the attack was the latest in a series on kabul and other afghan 
cities by rebels seeking to topple the marxist government of 
president najib 
the sevenparty afghan guerrilla alliance based in pakistans 
frontier city of peshawar said in a news release in islamabad that 
two prisoners of war were being freed as a goodwill gesture 
ahmad gailani chairman of the alliance said the soviet unions 
reaction to the prisoner release would decide the fate of soviet 
troops still held by afghan guerrillas the soviets say 312 
soldiers are missing in afghanistan 
the alliance wants to hold direct talks with the soviet union 
both about imprisoned soviet soldiers and the peaceful withdrawal 
of red army troops from afghanistan 
gulbaddin hekmatyar another guerrilla leader said at a news 
conference in islamabad that the soviet union must initiate talks 
azim nasser zia with gailanis national islamic front of 
afghanistan said the soviet union had already indicated a 
willingness to talk about prisoners of war but the guerrillas 
wanted talks expanded to include other issues including the soviet 
withdrawal 
the soviets began withdrawing troops from afghanistan may 15 
under the terms of a unbrokered accord signed in april it must 
withdraw half of its more than 100000 estimated troops by aug 15 
and the rest by next feb 15 
guerrilla leaders have said that until the soviet union opens 
direct talks with them they cannot guarantee safe passage for 
withdrawing troops 
the kremlin ordered troops and tanks into afghanistan in 
december 1979 to prop up the communist government there 
since the soviets began their pullout official soviet and 
afghan media have been reporting a sharp increase in attacks on 
afghan cities by the mostly moslem guerrillas

banks and money exchanges will be 
closed monday and tuesday while the government implements a new 
antiinflation economic package a legislator announced sunday 
cesar jaroslavsky a member of the house of deputies made the 
announcement as he left a meeting at the official residence of 
president raul alfonsin in suburban olivos 
jaroslavsky refused to comment on the contents of the plan 
alfonsin and economy minister juan sourrouille were reported to 
be awaiting the return sunday from washington of treasury secretary 
mario brodersohn and central bank president jose luis machinea to 
put the finishing touches on the plan 
brodersohn and machinea met last week with international 
monetary fund officials in an effort to obtain new loans including 
a 12 billion standby loan to help pay interest on the countrys 
53 billion foreign debt 
it is not unusual for argentine banks and other financial 
institutions to be ordered to close for up to 48 hours to avoid 
speculation when major changes in economic policy are scheduled 
no official statements have been made about the planned steps to 
reduce inflation which registered 3217 percent over the last 
year the cost of living rose 18 percent in june and the increase 
for july is expected to exceed 20 percent 
buenos aires newspapers speculated that the package will include 
a 10 percent devaluation of the austral the national currency 
modification of the twotier exchange rate system and an increase 
in taxes on agricultural exports 
they reported it also could involve a 2226 percent increase in 
public utility and transport rates and a request for businessmen to 
voluntarily limit price increases to 6 percent during august

after kevin ives and his best friend were 
run over by a train the state medical examiner ruled they had 
smoked so much marijuana that they lay down on the tracks and did 
not hear the roar of the oncoming union pacific freight 
dr fahmy malaks report said the boys slept as if in a coma 
motionless in identical positions their legs across the rails and 
their torsos between the tracks as the train bore down with horn 
blaring and bells clanging 
but the youths parents refused to accept malaks ruling of 
accidental death it was extremely unlikely that marijuana could 
have had such an extreme effect they said and that the boys would 
pass out in identical positions 
were willing to go to any length to solve this thing said 
larry ives kevins father all we want to know is what happened 
if someone can convince us beyond a doubt that this is what 
happened we can let it go but until then as long as theres a 
doubt we will pursue it 
their determination prompted investigations by a grand jury the 
fbi and the arkansas state police into the aug 23 1987 deaths of 
ives 17 and 16yearold don henry on the tracks about 15 miles 
southwest of little rock 
in june grand jurors issued a preliminary report saying the 
deaths were probably homicide the grand jury has continued 
meeting but has not rendered a final report 
we feel that people connected in the drug business know 
something about these deaths special deputy prosecuting attorney 
dan harmon said last month several witnesses who came before the 
grand jury have been charged with drug trafficking and other 
offenses 
the boys parents initially accepted malaks autopsy report 
not knowing any more about marijuana than we did ives said 
his wife linda began reading books about marijuana and its 
effects they talked to experts on marijuana 
the more we found out about it the less likely it seemed that 
that was the real cause ives said 
ives coincidentally a union pacific engineer said he recreated 
the death scene in his mind during latenight train runs 
several times ive tried to simulate the situation and see 
how much reaction time i would have to get an idea of exactly how 
much time the boys had after the horns started blowing and all that 
to make some type of movement ives said 
the boys had told dons parents they were going hunting and a 
22caliber rifle and flashlight were found at the accident scene 
several students said the youths told them they were going 
spotlighting for deer using a light to temporarily blind the 
animals and make them easier to shoot 
witnesses at a public hearing in february said they smoked 
marijuana with kevin and don the night before their deaths with 
estimates ranging from one cigarette to about five shared by a 
group of nine teenagers 
at the same hearing malak stood by his judgment that the 
psychedelic effects of marijuana could have knocked the the 
boys out 
the results of an independent autopsy have not been made public 
but saline county deputy prosecutor richard garrett has presented 
testimony from medical experts and quoted researchers as calling it 
highly unlikely if not impossible for a person to pass out from 
smoking marijuana 
common sense would also tell you that it would not be probable 
that any two people would pass out at the same time from the use of 
any drug or alcohol and for them to pass out in exactly the same 
position would really be improbable garrett said

mazlan ariffin deputy police chief at butterworth a coastal 
city 190 miles northwest of the capital said the death toll was 
expected to rise because 40 of the injured were in critical 
condition the bernama news agency reported 
one of the injured jenny ang a 13yearold student from 
butterworth said i managed to cling to the edge of the platform 
and was helped up by a man 
below me i saw a whole load of people piled down there 
was total pandemonium and chaos with people rushing to get out of 
the human pile she told the national news agency bernama 
she suffered only a slight facial injury 
gee swee cain a 41yearold woman who had been waiting to cross 
over on a ferry to the festival told bernama monday everything 
happened so fast i could only scream for help 
i heard someone from above telling me to be patient 
because at that time nothing could be done to help me she was 
quoted as saying 
mrs gee was pinned under steel and timber wreckage from the 
platform suffering chest and facial injuries and a broken leg 
many passengers fell onto the platform about 40 feet underneath 
the platform gives vehicles access to ferries and holds a port 
commission office 
bernama said firefighters and port workers still were searching 
the debris late sunday for more bodies 
ariffin said a huge crowd was waiting for ferries to take them 
to penang island about three miles across the stait of malacca 
for a festival when a section of the structure collapsed the 
accident occurred at 440 pm 
syed mohamad aidid chairman of the penang ports commission that 
operates the ferry terminal said there usually are only 200 people 
at a time on the section that collapsed he said more than 300 
people were moving across it to enter a ferry when it gave way and 
that more than 3000 people were lined up behind them 
we had enough personnel to control the situation and 
instructed them to allow the passengers in batches of about 200 to 
300 but the crowd was too big and the platform gave way he said 
we were prepared to meet the massive passenger crowd and 
traffic in view of the kwan yin festival on the island but never 
thought the section would collapse he said 
the festival when chinese offer prayers to the goddess of 
mercy or kwan yin is held once every 60 years according to 
chinese tradition of malaysias 16 million people about 48 
million are chinese 
there were no reports of foreigners among the casualties 
thirtyfive people have so far been reported dead and 737 
injured in the collapse bernama said monday quoting police and 
other sources 
ariffin said 17 bodies were recovered at the scene and 13 people 
died at the butterworth district hospital he said 180 victims were 
in the butterworth hospital 149 in the nearby bukit mertajam 
district hospital and 40 in critical condition in the penang

involved in the collapse he said 30 were confirmed to have died at 
the scene 391 were admitted to hospital emergency wards and 54 
received outpatient treatment 
prime minister datuk seri mahathir mohamad said his government 
would provide aid for the victims and would consider compensation 
for their families the section of the pier that collapsed was 
about 40 feet long three cars entering the ferry were crushed and 
the port commission office under the platform was destroyed 
the jetty with the pier was built in 1956 and repaired from time 
to time bernama reported the platform which collapsed was last 
renovated in early 1986 when its planks and bolts were replaced 
the structure was built with pillars only at the sides of the 
structure and not in the center where the section failed 
in kuala lumpur the capital transport minister ling liong sik 
told reporters that an open inquiry would be held to determine why 
the jetty collapsed

national urban league president john e jacob on 
sunday lashed out at the republican party saying he questioned its 
claims of trying to woo black voters in this years presidential 
election 
jacob said at a news conference opening the groups fourday 
national conference that likely gop presidential nominee george 
bush declined an invitation to address the gathering just as 
ronald reagan didnt come in 1984 
that makes you wonder about the sincerity of claims to try to 
get black support in 1988 he said it makes you wonder about 
the wisdom of the advice hes getting 
and it makes you wonder whether a candidate who refuses to 
come to the urban leagues annual meeting will be a president who 
refuses to let the urban league come to the white house jacob 
said 
in remarks prepared for his keynote address sunday night jacob 
continued his criticism of the gop 
eight years ago ronald reagan rode into town and everyone but 
blacks cheered he said americans have now discovered why 
blacks werent waving their hats 
never in living memory has there been an administration whose 
policies have been so insensitive to the needs of poor and working 
people jacob said and we remind america that more far more 
poor people are white than black 
in the speech jacob called for racial parity by 2000 a 
national job program an earlychildhood education program welfare 
reform health care for people with no health insurance and 
aggressive national policies to protect civil rights and wipe out 
the last vestiges of racism and discrimination 
although critical of the republicans jacob said the 
organization would not endorse any candidate for the nov 8 general 
election 
on saturday bush spokesman mark goodin said a scheduling 
conflict prevented the vice president from accepting the 
invitation he said bush plans to spend this week examining 
potential running mates and will deliver a major foreign policy 
speech in chicago on tuesday 
the urban league conference will hear from democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis on monday and jesse jackson on 
wednesday 
rep jack kemp rny a candidate for the gop presidential 
nomination during the early days of the 1988 campaign will be part

the following are excerpts from king 
husseins address to the nation sunday as translated from arabic by 
the associated press 
jordan is not palestine the independent palestinian state 
will be established on the occupied palestinian land after its 
liberation god willing 
there the palestinian identity will be embodied and there the 
palestinian struggle shall come to fruition as confirmed by the 
glorious uprising of the palestinian people under occupation 
we assure you that these measures do not mean the abandonment of 
our national duty either towards the arabisraeli conflict or 
towards the palestinian cause 
these steps were taken only in response to the wish of the 
palestine liberation organization and the prevailing arab 
conviction that such measures would contribute to the struggle of 
the palestinian people 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
no one outside palestine has had or can have an attachment to 
palestine or its cause firmer than that of jordan or of my family 
jordan will not give up its commitment to take part in the peace 
process we have contributed to the peace process until it reached 
a stage of a consensus to convene an international peace conference 
on the middle ast 
jordan is a principal party to the arabisraeli conflict and to 
the peace process it shoulders its national responsibility on 
that basis 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in addition to the plos palestine liberation organization 
ambition to embody the palestinian identity on palestinian national 
soil there should be the separation of the west bank from the 
hashemite kingdom of jordan 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the timing of his actions derive from the principles of 
arab unity and the political reality of the scope of benefit to the 
palestinian peoples struggle that accrues from maintaing the legal 
relationship between the two banks 
we believe that such unity between two or more arab peoples is a 
right of choice for every arab people 
we have responded to the wish of the representatives of the 
palestinian people for unity with jordan in 1950 
we respect the wish of the plo for an independent palestinian 
state 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
jordan will remain the proud bearer of the message of the great 
arab revolt faithful to its principles believing in the common 
arab destiny and committed to joint arab action 
since the israeli aggression of june 1967 it has been our 
belief that our first priority should be to liberate the land and 
holy places from israeli occupation 
we had never imagined that the preservation of the legal and 
administrative links between the two banks could constitute an 
obstacle to the liberation of the occupied palestinian land 
yet lately it has transpired that there is a general palestinian 
and arab orientation towards highlighting the palestinian identity 
in a complete manner in every effort or activity related to the 
palestinian question and its developments 
jordans maintaining links with the west bank contradicts this 
orientation and hampers the palestinian strugle to gain 
international support for the palestinian cause as the national 
cause of a people struggling against foreign occupation 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it is the view of the plo and arab leaders that the struggle 
to liberate the occupied palestinian land could be enhanced by 
dismantling the jordans legal and administrative links 
we have to fulfil our duty and do what is required of us we 
pray god that this step be a subtantive addition to the 
intensifying palestinian struggle for freedom and independence 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it has to be understood in all clarity and without any ambiguity 
or equivocation that our measures regarding the west bank concern 
only the occupied palestinian land and its people and do not 
relate in any way to the jordanian citizens of palestinian origin 
in the hashemite kingdom of jordan 
national unity is precious in any country but in jordan it is 
more than that it is the basis of our stability and the 
springboard of our development and prosperity it is a living 
example of constructive plurality and a sound nucleus for wider 
arab unity 
any attempt to undermine it unity under any pretext would only 
help the enemy carry out his policy of expansion at the expense of 
palestine and jordan alike

protest this week three white lawmen accused of killing a black 
jail inmate face another round in their battle to avoid further 
prosecution

firstdegree murder charges

hundreds of abandoned cars are cluttering streets 
in and around boston amid efforts to end a dispute over hazardous 
waste at two major automobile shredders 
we do have a definite problem there is a list of several 
hundred cars to be towed said new bedford police sgt frederic 
anselmo were in limbo the cars are being abandoned on side 
streets and they are staying there because the 16 tow companies 
working for us have suspended their operations 
the backup began after the voluntary closings in june of 
prolerized new england co of everett and a subsidiary patriot 
metals of worcester 
the closings came after the state department of environmental 
quality engineering determined in june there were high levels of 
pcbs and oil byproducts in the residue called fluff from shredded 
cars at patriot metals 
we since signed a limited compliance agreement on july 11 and 
they are targeting the threat at both facilities deqe 
spokeswoman katie stimmel said it calls for the covering of 
residue stored on site and building some kind of containment 
facility 
but it was unclear when the two yards which handle an estimated 
350000 cars annually would be able to resume operation 
joseph romei general manager of prolerized said he hopes 
something will happen soon or he may have to lay off workers 
and i cant even start to assess the effects of the 900 or so 
auto wreckers in the state romei said once their yards get 
filled and there is no place to go with cars there is lot of 
backup industry of material 
the shutdown has forced boston officials to store about 800 
cars with even more waiting to be towed said city transportation 
commissioner richard a dimino 
we have a backlog of 1500 out there dimino said we are 
getting close to capacity 
in all massachusetts has four major car shredders and two firms 
that handle the shredding of such appliances as washing machines 
once a car is towed by a salvage service a machine is used to 
flatten it most of the oil brake fluid and other liquids are 
removed during this phase the metal hulk is then sold to a 
shredding company where machineswung hammers complete the 
destruction separating the ferrous metal from nonmagnetic metals 
and other materials 
fifty percent of what is shaken out is plain dirt the rest is 
plastics glass carpeting rubber around the windows and other 
things you can touch it and not come away with any grease or oil 
on your hands said romei of prolerized deqe said the amount 
of pcb levels in the fluff was more than 50 parts per million 
meaning it was hazardous waste but from our standpoint the pcb 
levels have always been controlled

foreign minister shimon peres said sunday that 
jordan would remain a key partner in the middle east peace process 
despite king husseins vow to relinquish any control over the 
israelioccupied west bank 
husseins reversal sunday which came three months before 
israels national elections dealt a severe blow to peres he had 
staked his political prestige on the jordanian option peace 
talks with a joint jordanianpalestinian delegation at an 
international peace conference 
peres leader of the leftofcenter labor party played down the 
importance of husseins announcement by saying hussein committed 
himself to continued involvement in the peace process 
prime minister yitzhak shamir peres main political rival 
suggested that husseins move was beneficial for israel because it 
removed the west bank as a potential issue of contention between 
israel and jordan we have nothing to be sorry about shamir 
said referring to the kings speech 
in his television speech hussein called for keeping the west 
bank separate from jordan he said he respected the wish of the 
palestine liberation organization to secede from us in an 
independent palestinian state 
shamir head of the rightwing likud bloc staunchly opposes an 
international conference and israeli withdrawal from the occupied 
territories including the west bank shamir has said he was only 
willing to talk about limited selfrule for palestinians in the 
occupied lands 
east jerusalem newspaper editor hanna siniora a palestinian 
said husseins position would force israel to start talking to the 
plo and launch a new chapter of cooperation between the plo and 
jordan 
israel refuses to negotiate with the plo saying it is a 
terrorist organization 
husseins speech came after he canceled a 13 billion 
development plan for the occupied territories and dissolved 
jordans lower house of parliament earlier this week half the 
legislators came from the west bank which israel seized from 
jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
husseins announcement sunday reversed his initial agreement to 
peace talks between israel and a joint jordanianpalestinian 
delegation under the auspices of an international conference 
such an arrangement would have helped israel sidestep the plo 
since rumors of husseins new policy first began to surface last 
week peres has begun raising the possibility of separate 
negotiations with palestinians 
peres reiterated his new emphasis in a statement sunday saying 
we are ready to talk to jordan about peace we are ready to talk 
to the palestinians about the palestinian problem we are ready to 
talk to both about peace and solving the palestinian problem 
peres also said the speech did not make clear whether he 
relinquished all responsibility for the west bank 
the election in israel will determine whether the jordanian 
option is still alive said a top foreign ministry official 
speaking on condition of anonymity if labor wins the election i 
can assure you jordan and palestinians will be willing to go to an 
international conference as part of a joint delegation 
a spokesman for shamir said husseins speech did not affect 
shamirs stance we dont see any reason to change our 
position shamir spokesman yossi ahimeir said 
binyamin netanyahu a top likud candidate in the november 
elections said jordans new policy made it imperative for israel 
not to withdraw from occupied lands 
today it has to become completely clear that those who talk 
about the transfer of territory talk about the transfer of 
territory into the hands of the plo netanyahu said in a thinly 
veiled attack on labor which favors limited territorial compromise

king hussein on sunday called for an 
independent palestinian state in the israelioccupied territories 
and appeared to rule out the idea of jordan representing 
palestinians in any peace talks 
jordan is not palestine the king said in a speech the 
independent palestinian state will be established on occupied 
palestinian land after its liberation god willing 
it was not the first time hussein had called for an independent 
palestinian state but it was the first time he categorically 
divorced himself from palestinians in the occupied lands and told 
them to take affairs into their own hands 
hussein said jordans links to them hamper the palestinian 
struggle to gain international support for the palestinian cause 
as the national cause of a people struggling against foreign 
occupation 
israeli foreign minister shimon peres said sunday that jordan 
would remain a key partner in the peace process despite husseins 
vow to relinquish any control over the israelioccupied west bank 
meanwhile prime minister yitzhak shamir peres main political 
rival suggested that husseins move was beneficial for israel 
because it removed the west bank as a potential issue of contention 
between israel and jordan 
israel seized the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip from 
egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
husseins move could leave the palestine liberation 
organization which claims to be the sole representative of 
palestinians israels only negotiating partner in talks to resolve 
the issue israel refuses to talk to the plo calling it a 
terrorist organization 
under a recent us peace initiative by secretary of state 
george p shultz jordan would be partially responsible for 
representing the palestinians in peace talks israeli leaders had 
called for negotiations with a joint jordanianpalestinian 
delegation and said the palestinians must not be members of the plo 
shultz speaking on cbstvs face the nation denied the 
move would pressure the united states and israel to find a way to 
talk to the plo 
we will stay right where we are were ready to talk to them 
plo when they take certain steps which are very clear and as 
far as i can see not too onerous after all israel is there 
israel is going to stay there were going to continue to support 
them he said 
the speech followed moves by hussein to give greater 
responsibility for palestinian affairs to the plo 
on saturday he dissolved the lower house of parliament half 
the houses members were from the west bank on thursday he 
canceled a 13 billion development project plan for the west bank 
and gaza strip 
king hussein described the measures as aimed at enhancing the 
palestinian national orientation and highlighting the palestinian 
identity 
commenting on the meaning of establishing an independent 
palestinian state hussein said that in addition to the plos 
ambition to embody the palestinian identity on palestinian national 
soil there should be a separation of the west bank from the 
hashemite kingdom of jordan 
there the palestinian identity will be embodied and there the 
palestinian struggle shall come to fruition as confirmed by the 
glorious uprising of the palestinian people under occupation he 
said 
the 8monthold uprising in the israelioccupied territories has 
given greater international prominence to the palestinian cause and 
increased calls for an independent state 
up to twothirds of jordans 35 million population is of 
palestinian origin 
we assure you that these measures do not mean the abandonment 
of our national duty either towards the arabisraeli conflict or 
towards the palestinian cause the king said in a 17minute 
address broadcast on national television 
he added that these steps were taken only in response to the 
wish of the palestine liberation organization and the 
prevailing arab conviction that such measures would contribute to 
the struggle of the palestinian people 
in israel prominent palestinian leader faisal husseini said 
saturday that hussein was sending a clear message to both the 
americans and the israelis with his recent moves 
these steps mean that everything must be transferred to 
the plo and the plo must be responsible for everything here he 
said hussein is sending a message that there is no jordanian 
option there is no way but the palestinian option through the 
plo 
jordan pays 50 million in salaries to teachers lawyers and 
other employees who work in arab institutions in the west bank 
the king affirmed his commitment to the support and asistance 
for the palestinian people until they achieve their national goals 
god willing 
hussein said his country will not give up its commitment to 
take part in the peace process 
we have contributed to the peace process until it reached a 
stage of a consensus to convene an international peace conference 
on the middle east the king said

men whose jobs combine high psychological 
demands with little control over their work face two to three times 
the risk of heart attack that other male workers do a new study 
suggests 
cooks waiters computer operators gas station attendants and 
some assembly line workers were among the highrisk jobs found in 
the analysis of nearly 5000 men 
but employers may be able to redesign highrisk jobs to lower 
heart attack risk and improve productivity said robert karasek 
associate professor in the industrial and systems engineering 
department at the university of southern california 
karasek reports the studys findings in the august issue of the 
american journal of public health along with coauthors from 
sweden the state university of new york at stony brook cornell 
university medical school and columbia university 
the study focused on job strain which results from having too 
little control over ones work to deal satisfactorily with its 
psychological demands those demands included having to work 
quickly and facing heavy workloads 
executive and professional jobs were not considered highstrain 
because they include a lot of control karasek said 
the study was based on past heart attacks reported by men in two 
federal surveys too few women with heart attacks appeared in those 
surveys for a meaningful analysis of them karasek said 
one federal study the health examination survey done in 
196061 found 39 heart attacks among 2409 employed men the 
other the health and nutrition examination survey done from 1971 
to 1975 counted 30 heart attacks among 2424 employed men 
to assess job characteristics for all 4833 men researchers 
used federal studies of the conditions faced by workers of various 
jobs measurements for job traits such as control over the work 
were computed for 221 occupations 
then those measurements were adjusted for each worker based on 
his age race education geographic region and whether or not he 
was selfemployed or worked in a city 
the study gave two sets of findings one from each of the large 
federal surveys 
men whose jobs put them in the top 20 percent for job strain 
had 248 times and 328 times the risk of heart attack of the other 
workers the comparison took into account their ages which karasek 
said was the most important influence on heart attack risk but 
ignored other risk factors like smoking 
men in the top 10 percent for job strain ran 38 and 479 times 
the heart attack risk of men in the lowest 10 percent jobs in the 
top 10 percent included cashiers and waiters while those in the 
bottom 10 percent included foresters natural scientists and civil 
engineers 
this comparison took into account a list of heart attack risk 
factors age race cigarette use education blood pressure and 
cholesterol levels 
job strain appeared to account for between a fourth and a third 
of heart attacks in the two surveys this analysis accounted only 
for age but karasek said the results were similar when the other 
risk factors were also considered 
the study does not prove that job strain raises the risk of 
heart attacks karasek said but the idea is supported by other 
research 
in this study researchers did not know if workers were in their 
reported jobs when the heart attack occurred but it is unlikely 
that a worker would have a heart attack in a lowstrain job and 
later move into a highstrain one karasek said 
giving workers more control has long been advocated as a means 
of increasing productivity he said it might also reduce job 
strain along with letting workers use underutilized skills and 
making their jobs platforms for learning new skills he said 
karaseks results are impressive said david krantz professor 
of medical psychology at the uniformed services university of the 
health sciences in bethesda md 
the very promising job strain hypothesis should be tested by 
research that measures each workers job strain directly follows 
him over time and takes the various risk factors into account 
krantz said

secretary of state george p shultz sets out 
monday on a 10day visit to nine latin american countries 
intending to discuss ways of bringing new pressure to bear on 
nicaraguas leftist government and to call attention to democratic 
gains elsewhere in the hemisphere 
the first stop is guatemala where shultz will meet with the 
foreign ministers of four central american countries in an attempt 
to come up with a common strategy for exerting diplomatic pressure 
on nicaragua to establish democracy 
shultz on sunday said that a statement which he said was drafted 
mostly by the foreign ministers of guatemala el salvador costa 
rica and honduras is still open to discussion 
were not trying to ram anything down anyones throat having 
drafted it they are not so sure they want to issue it shultz 
said on cbstvs face the nation 
a senior administration official who briefed reporters on 
friday said it was unclear whether the guatemala meeting will 
result in a joint statement of principles designed to prod 
nicaragua into complying with its stated commitment to move toward 
democracy 
the official who insisted on anonymity said a consensus on a 
common policy toward nicaragua has been difficult to reach 
the special us envoy to central america morris busby has 
been consulting on that issue with officials from the four central 
american democracies 
in managua on sunday nicarguan president daniel ortega urged 
the four countries to reject any us attempt to condemn or isolate 
his country 
he said the united states is trying to escalate the war 
with consequences for all the central american countries not just 
for nicaragua 
ortega told reporters he hoped the central american 
governments will respond with dignity and firmness and reject the 
proposal of the united states 
meanwhile a guatemalan legislator accused the state department 
of trying to pressure the four countries into signing a virtual 
declaration of war against nicaragua 
the legislator edmund mulet lesiur representing a political 
party known as the union of the national center said president 
vinicio cerzo rejected a demand by busby to abandon guatemalas 
policy of active neutrality by agreeing to the document 
mulet said honduras and el salvador had agreed to sign it while 
guatemala and costa rica turned it down 
the us embassy in guatemala city issued a statement sunday 
categorically denying mulets statements made in an interview with 
a guatemala city newspaper 
the united states has not pressured guatemala or any other 
country the united states has not asked guatemala to abandon 
active neutrality the embassy said 
a fragile ceasefire remains in place in nicaragua but there has 
been no progress on a final settlement between the sandinistas and 
the contra rebels the impasse has produced calls by conservative 
members of congress for a renewal of military aid to the rebels 
in public statements this past week rebel leaders have 
maintained that the truce has helped the sandinistas by enabling 
them to strengthen their overall military position at a time when 
the contras have been denied lethal aid from the united states 
the administration has contended that the sandinistas also have 
stepped up internal repression since the truce went into effect 
four months ago 
in a commentary this past week in the new york times assistant 
secretary of state elliott abrams said the situation in nicaragua 
deteriorated after congress rejected a contra military aid request 
in february 
since then the predictable has happened the communists have 
increased repression and mocked the promises they made and why 
not when our military support for the fighters has been halted 
while soviet arms deliveries continue 
much of shultzs trip will be devoted to highlighting the 
democratic trend in the hemisphere all of the nations on his 
itinerary have elected governments and all with the exception of 
costa rica became democratic over the past nine years 
after guatemala shultz will travel to argentina uruguay 
brazil and bolivia before a return trip lasting 24 hours to 
central america on aug 8 for talks in costa rica el salvador and 
honduras 
the trip ends on aug 10 when shultz will attend the inaugural 
ceremony of ecuadoran presidentelect rodrigo borja while in 
quito shultz also will confer with president jaime lucinchi of 
venezuela and president virgilio barco of colombia 
shultz has visited each country on his schedule before except 
bolivia where officials give president victor paz estenssoro high 
marks for revitalizing the economy and moving decisively against 
drug smugglers in la paz shultz will deliver a speech on the drug 
issue 
abrams believes the focus on administration setbacks in 
nicaragua and panama have deflected attention from the democratic 
progress made elsewhere in latin america 
in his times commentary abrams wrote that throughout the 7 
years of the reagan presidency no latin american democracy has 
been replaced by a dictatorship 
pronouncing reagans policy an extraordinary success abrams 
said that the united states has helped promote the greatest 
expansion of democracy in latin history

the home county of house speaker jim 
wright dtexas collected the most federal money on a per capita 
basis of any large urban area in the nation in 1986 a newspapers 
analysis found 
the dallas morning news which tracked federal spending for 
fiscal years 1986 and 1987 through 50 states and 3041 counties 
reported sunday that tarrant county achieved its top ranking 
primarily through the awarding of multibilliondollar defense 
contracts 
the federal government spent more than 55 billion or 5481 
per person in tarrant county in 1986 the next year amid a steep 
decline in defense spending the county dropped to the no 4 per 
capita position with 44 billion or 4030 per person according 
to the newspapers analysis 
tarrant countys 198687 total was 99 billion or 9511 per 
capita the average us county studied received a twoyear total 
of 3577 per person for 1986 and 1987 
wright district includes most of fort worth and the suburban 
cities in northwestern tarrant county he has represented the 
district for more than three decades and the countys high ranking 
in part is a reflection of wrights increasing influence in how tax 
dollars are spent 
wright is unopposed for reelection this year but faces an 
investigation by the house ethics committee into allegations that 
he improperly interceded on behalf of troubled savings and loan 
executives in texas and that he wrongly profited from royalties on 
a book 
wrights critics say the spending ranking only reinforces 
wrights image as a provincial porkbarrel politician 
jim wright generates more pork than is hanging in a kansas 
slaughterhouse said don mcniel the alvarado texas republican 
who tried to unseat wright in 1986 its the pork barrel capital 
of america 
pork barrel is an abused and grotesquely overused word 
wright said in response i think its a sloppy word used 
indiscriminately to belittle projects that one doesnt understand 
and from which one doesnt benefit 
military spending makes up the greatest slice of tarrant 
countys federal pie with 83 percent of the 99 billion in funds 
received coming from defense contracts the bulk of tarrant 
countys 82 billion in defense contracts went to general 
dynamics maker of the f16 jet fighter and the countys largest 
employer with 28000 workers 
the newspapers analysis of federal spending in fiscal 1986 and 
1987 used the census bureaus consolidated federal funds report 
which tracks federal spending through 50 states 3041 counties and 
more than 80000 local governments 
some federal defense funds traced to a particular county later 
are funneled to subcontractors in other counties making it 
difficult to determine how much money a specific county keeps

the governing partys first congress since 
the ouster of tunisias founding father on sunday endorsed the new 
president and called for a confederation of north african nations 
american officials have expressed concern the idea could greatly 
extend libyan leader col moammar gadhafis influence in north 
africa 
the threeday congress of the constitutional democratic rally 
marked a triumph for founder habib bourguibas successor president 
zine el abidine ben ali he was confirmed as party leader amid 
enthusiastic applause of more than 2000 delegates 
the delegates adopted a resolution endorsing a future great 
arab maghreb without frontiers the congress unanimously backed 
tunisias membership in the proposed confederation of north african 
countries with algeria morocco libya and mauritania 
the project has gained momentum since the recent reconciliation 
between algeria and morocco and tunisia and libya 
such a confederation was long blocked by the algerianmoroccan 
conflict over the disputed western sahara but it became a 
practical possibility following the reconciliation in may between 
the two arab neighbors 
in addition tunisia broke relations with tripoli following 
gadhafis expulsion of more than 30000 tunisian workers in 1985 
but the two neighbors patched up their differences late last year 
to promote the planned confederation ben ali was due to begin a 
fourday visit to libya friday 
the steps planned for the group include a joint identity card 
for the five participating nations 
the party congress also confirmed ben ali as party president it 
thus ensured that it would retain its political preeminence at 
least in the immediate future 
ben ali 52 a former army general and bourguibas prime 
minister seized power last nov 7 after seven physicians certified 
that the 84yearold veteran leader was incapacitated by senility 
bourguiba formed the party he named the constitutionalist 
socialist party more than 50 years ago to lead tunisia to 
independence from france in 1956 it was recently renamed the 
constitutional democratic rally 
bourguiba remains under closely guarded house arrest but has not 
been charged with a crime 
at the congress opening friday ben ali promised to maintain a 
balanced political liberalism based on political pluralism and 
a free enterprise economy 
for the first time leaders of the three legal opposition 
parties were invited to attend a governing party congress 
parliamentary elections are to be held in november presidential 
and legislative elections usually coincide in tunisia and ben ali 
is widely expected to run for election in november

a drug treatment facility named for nancy 
reagan is facing opposition from community leaders and homeowners 
who dont want the center in a san fernando valley residential area 
city councilman ernani bernardi and los angeles county 
supervisor mike antonovich who represent the area said the center 
shouldnt be located at the former lake view terrace medical center 
as planned 
at a meeting saturday antonovich urged formation of a committee 
to find an alternate site saying placing a treatment center 
like this in a residential community is an inappropriate decision 
the residential site is near an elementary school and a 
convalescent home the center would treat 150 adolescents and 60 
adults 
the nancy reagan center is an attempt to take the first ladys 
antidrug crusade beyond the white house years wealthy 
entertainment industry friends led by merv griffin have been 
enlisted to help raise money 
lorraine mohr vice president of the nonprofit phoenix house 
drug service agency which would operate the facility said it 
would benefit the community and wouldnt pose a danger to residents 
the people in our program no longer want to be associated or 
involved with drugs she said 
opposition swelled when a judge decided in may to give phoenix 
house 200 days to raise the 77 million needed to buy the bankrupt 
medical center 
lewis snow chairman of the lake view homeowners association 
said the proposal was the right facility in the wrong place 
residents fear property values will fall and crime and drug use 
among their children will rise if the drug treatment center is in 
their neighborhood

officials decided sunday to let blazing 
tank cars of alcohol derailed in a headon freight train collision 
burn themselves out while some of the 1000 evacuees returned home 
against authorities advice 
the crash killed two train crew members saturday but two others 
jumped to safety before the collision 
officials of the national transportation safety board met for an 
hour with police sunday and viewed the wreckage of one of the 
engines 
we did not find anything out of order said edward 
dobranetski who heads the sixmember ntsb investigating team 
the emergency brake was being applied 
although evacuees were allowed to return police tried to 
discourage them 
we are telling them of the dangers and leaving it up to 
them said britt adair police chief in this suburb east of des 
moines 
mayor tim burget said fires were burning up fuel faster than 
expected and that officials were making arrangements to have heavy 
equipment on hand monday morning in hopes of beginning a cleanup 
at this point things are looking better all the time it 
looks good at this time were getting confident nothing is going 
to happen he said 
the fire involved two tank cars loaded with denatured alcohol 
glenn mcdole chief of the polk county sheriffs patrol said 
the tank cars were still half full of alcohol sunday evening and 
flames were shooting up 15 to 20 feet half the height of the 
flames earlier in the day 
after hazardous material experts examined the wreck sunday 
adair said officials decided to simply allow the fire to burn until 
it ran out of fuel a process which could take until late monday 
as long as we sit and watch it were in a safe situation 
adair said if we try to mess with it we could be in trouble 
officials earlier had feared that a jammed pressure relief valve 
on one of the tanks could lead to an explosion but adair said the 
inspection revealed valves on both cars working 
pressure is being relieved on both tanks he said but he 
added its very dangerous theres no question about it 
adair said said the crash and derailment left the two tank cars 
toppled but in a natural ravine which could deflect the impact of 
any explosion 
those two cars are bunkered down in a ditch he said 
the tank cars typically carry more than 20000 of liquid said 
anthony bacino hazardous materials officer for iowa interstate 
owner of both trains 
bacino said the fumes from raw denatured alcohol are toxic and 
explosive but smoke from the burning alcohol is not hazardous 
security was tight at the scene warren winter a parttime 
photographer for the associated press said highway patrol troopers 
confiscated his film after he slipped through barriers and took 
pictures of the wreckage 
i saw one fuel tanker burning like mad winter said its 
a big burning mess 
rail officials said the eastbound train was pulling 78 cars 
while the westbound train pulled eight the eastbound train was 
headed from council bluffs to chicago while the westbound was a 
local freight going from newton to des moines 
dobranetski would not speculate how two trains ended up on the 
same track headed in opposite directions 
drug testing will be done he said its required by law 
the safety board has declared this to be a major rail 
accident he said 
police swept through the area after the crash saturday 
evacuating residents sending them to local churches and elementary 
schools for the night 
police cars and fire engines were scattered throughout this city 
of 5700 keeping roads to the crash site sealed gov terry 
branstad toured the scene saturday night but was kept a mile away 
at one church where evacuees were taken greg jay tried to keep 
tabs on his family and a pet 
its more inconvenient than anything else weve got three 
little ones and we had to bundle them down here he said

that is the prognosis of national political pollsters who had 
expected dukakis leap in the polls and now predict it will 
subside at least to some extent as the harmony of the democratic 
national convention fades the polls are accurate the question 
is are they predictive of what will happen on election day said

that the race will tighten up 
for the moment dukakis has a commanding lead he was ahead by

26 per hour for each employee 
green also wants a reduction in overtime expansion of worker 
training programs and jobsecurity agreements that were among the 
few gains the union claimed in the last two contracts 
those agreements resulted in frozen wages and cuts in bonuses 
the 1986 talks were extended four times before a settlement was 
reached the 1982 negotiations broke down and a record sevenmonth 
strike ensued as caterpillar tried to convince the union it faced 
trouble after posting its best year ever in 1981 with profits of 
579 million 
the next three years were stained with red ink caterpillar 
closed nine plants and slashed its work force 40 percent from 
nearly 88000 to 53600 in an effort to survive soaring interest 
rates a strong us dollar and fierce foreign competition in a 
stagnant marketplace 
nobody believed cat was in dire straits green said we 
were too content everyone suffered in the strike we went through 
hell were not a bunch of strikehappy nuts because no one really 
wins but we will strike if we have to 
deere still is trying to rebound from a fivemonth strike in 
198687 the longest in the companys 151year history already 
suffering from the prolonged farm recession deeres earnings 
collapsed when socked by the strike and the company lost 328 
million in two years 
the 163day work stoppage at 13 deere plants in illinois iowa 
minneapolis georgia tennessee and colorado ended feb 1 1987 
when union workers accepted a wage freeze a onetime 735 payment 
each and creation of a jobprotection plan 
deere earnings for the first half of fiscal 1988 which ended 
april 30 were 154 million on sales of 25 billion 
analysts disagree on the effects of the 1988 drought on deere 
sales and earnings but the issue is expected to come up during the 
contract talks 
as with caterpillar the deere talks also will focus on merit 
increases and job security both sides decline to talk in detail 
but say they are confident they can achieve a settlement without a 
strike 
we expect to reach an agreement that satisfies the 
requirements and deere and its uaw represented employees said g 
bart bontems director of industrial relations for the company 
united auto workers shares the belief with deere amp co that 
the discussions will be productive jim hecker international 
representative of the uaw 
the average deere factory worker makes 1547 per hour and the 
company calculates its labor costs at 2690 per hour including 
vacation bonuses holidays and other fringe benefits 
the current talks will affect about 13400 active employees and 
4000 laidoff workers at 11 cities in illinois iowa minnesota 
colorado and georgia deere employs about 38000 employees

the chicago amp north western transportation co 
and its brakemen say it may take an act of congress to avert a 
strike idling farm belt boxcars and stranding thousands of 
commuters 
and lawmakers taking the threat seriously are considering 
legislation to keep the trains rolling 
the united transportation union is threatening to strike 
thursday if campnw adopts new work rules eliminating jobs for 1156 
utu brakemen 
but neither side can act until a coolingoff period ordered by 
president reagan ends at 1201 am on aug 4 
in his order which also blocked an april walkout and created 
an emergency board to intervene in the case reagan said a strike 
against campnw could deprive several midwestern states of essential 
rail service and disrupt normal business activity in the chicago 
area where 40000 commuters use its trains daily 
negotiators for the company and clevelandbased union met last 
monday and tuesday at national mediation board headquarters in 
washington but suspended their talks after making no progress 
for almost two years weve been planning how we would operate 
in the event of a strike said james foote vice president of 
communications for cnw corp in chicago the railroads parent 
company were ready 
they didnt get what they wanted so they dont intend to talk 
and intend to promulgate all the things they wanted on aug 4 
utu president fred hardin said if they take that position that 
leaves us no alternative but to peacefully withdraw from service 
on july 1 the presidential emergency board proposed that campnw 
eliminate one brakeman per train and the other if approved by an 
arbitrator on a trainbytrain basis both sides rejected the plan 
foote said it might take an act of congress to bring a 
settlement a sentiment echoed by hardin but both sides spent 
last week lobbying vigorously against a bill introduced by rep 
john porter rill that would make the presidential boards 
recommendations binding unless the parties reach agreement without 
a strike 
the chairman of the house energey and commerce committees 
transportation subcommittee rep thomas a luken dohio said the 
measure would get prompt attention if there is no settlement by 
thursday 
this would be a crippling strike for commuters and many 
agricultural interests especially in these droughtstricken 
times luken said its premature for us to consider any action 
unless and until there would be a strike but we intend to be in a 
position to move very quickly 
the railroad operates on 6400 miles of track with 8000 
employees in illinois iowa kansas michigan minnesota missouri 
nebraska south dakota wisconsin and wyoming 
it ranks eighth among us railroads in revenue generating 
8935 million last year by moving 17 million carloads of freight 
weve cut our work force cut expenses and improved our 
productivity dramatically foote said but because of 
competition and lower rates our revenue per car has declined 26 
percent since 1982 
campnw wants to save 51 million a year by cutting most of its 
train crews from four to two people eliminating what it considers 
unnecessary brakemens jobs and leaving an engineer and conductor 
on board 
weve made agreements in good faith with all the other 
carriers since the 1970s to cut down to one conductor and one 
brakeman on each crew and negotiate for the other brakeman said 
hardin whose union represents both brakemen and conductors if 
campnw were to win we have a strike and theyre victorious then 
theyd have an unfair advantage over the other railroads 
hardin said he was not sure whether the utu would extend a 
strike to other carriers and he did not know if campnw employees 
from 15 other unions would walk off the job in sympathy 
if its a legal strike our people would said jim shell 
vice president of the brotherhood of locomotive engineers in 
cleveland thats a matter of personal choice whether a member 
crosses their picket lines or not but this organization 
traditionally has honored legal strikes 
foote said the company is ready if all its union workers walk 
out 
about 80 percent of our management people have been given 
assignments that they will work if theres a strike he said 
we also have a pool of approximately 8000 former railroad 
employees who will work 
commuter trains would halt for the duration of the strike but 
foote said management could operate enough trains from the first 
day of a walkout to maintain about 80 percent of the railroads 
normal freight revenue and replacement workers would be on the job 
within days

leaders of the united steelworkers of america 
convene their biennial convention monday in las vegas to take 
another crack at helping put a democrat in the white house 
theres no question about the support for dukakis said gary 
hubbard aide to usw president lynn williams 
but the usw is not as populous as it used to be membership has 
tumbled from 14 million in 1976 to 650000 now and there is 
debate about how much influence the union leadership exerts over 
its members 
furthermore political analysts inside and outside the usw say 
the campaign organization of democrat michael dukakis is not eager 
to wear a union label to the november election against vice 
president george bush 
dukakis will address the las vegas convention thursday in person 
or by satellite video the union will express its preference but 
will not formally endorse a candidate hubbard said 
the usws contracts with most major steelmakers do not expire 
until next year and a fouryear pact with the biggest producer 
usx runs into 1890 leaving internal union business and 
presidential politics to dominate the convention 
the aflcio of which the usw is the 11th largest member has 
told its member unions to defer endorsing dukakis until the 
aflcios general board makes its endorsement in late august 
the umbrella organizations early endorsement of walter mondale 
during the 1984 democratic primary hurt the presidential candidate 
even before he faced ronald reagan and neither dukakis nor 
organized labor wants to repeat that mistake said ben fischer a 
former assistant to four usw presidents and now director of labor 
studies at carnegiemellon university 
the people who didnt have the unions backinghad to tar 
mondale as the candidate of special interests said fischer 
when the republicans do that you take it for granted when the 
democrats start doing that you start listening 
dukakis is trying to do this balancing rope job of on one hand 
having the leadership but on the other hand not allowing too close 
of an identification fischer said 
but hubbard disputed that an early endorsement by organized 
labor necessarily was harmful 
weve seen no liability from early endorsement largely because 
we put forth such enormous energy in all the traditional activities 
to get out the vote that includes phone banking and door knocking 
the numbers prove the enormous participation of organized workers 
particularly steelworkers versus unorganized workers hubbard 
said 
dukakis is appealing directly to members not through 
endorsements but through his support for traditional values said 
ted windt a university of pittsburgh communications professor and 
specialist in presidential rhetoricwindt said its a very 
adroit strategy 
appealing directly to union members may be more effective 
anyway windt and fischer said 
the solidarity between the leadership and the rank and 
filedoesnt mean what it did back in the 1950s or 60s said 
windt he cited the 1972 election in which gallup polls indicated 
54 percent of families of labor union members voted for richard 
nixons reelection while 46 percent voted for the democrat 
george mcgovern 
that was a real crossover by the rank and file windt said 
in 1968 hubert humphrey got 56 percent of the union families 
votes against 29 for nixon and the 15 percent that george wallace 
received was kind of a transition to nixon he said 
jimmy carter got 63 percent of their votes in 1976 versus 36 
percent for ford and in 1980 union households gave president 
carter only 50 percent of their votes against 43 percent for reagan 
and 5 percent for john anderson 
an abc news poll indicated 45 percent of union households voted 
for reagan and 54 percent for mondale four years ago 
its like the deregulation of the rank and file youve got 
the rank and file doing what they damn well please windt said

the nations economy kept growing in july 
although the pace slowed slightly from the previous month 
according to a survey of corporate purchasing managers 
the national association of purchasing management which 
conducts a monthly survey of economic trends at more than 250 
industrial companies said its index of economic growth dipped to 
59 percent in july from 593 percent in june 
a reading above 50 percent indicates the economy is expanding 
while levels below that point generally indicate the economy is 
contracting 
production growth slowed in july although new orders expanded 
sharply and inventories rose quickly the group stated 
the vigorous increase in new orders undoubtedly fueled by the 
surge in export orders is impressive and signals continued robust 
economic growth for the balance of the third quarter said robert 
j bretz chairman of the groups business survey committee 
among the purchasing managers surveyed 31 percent indicated 
their new orders had expanded compared with 34 percent in june 
while 12 percent said their rate of new orders was worse the same 
as in june 
of the 70 percent of the groups members that export 39 percent 
reported higher export orders during july up from 38 percent in 
june while only 3 percent said export orders were worse the same 
as in the previous month 
production slowed for 13 percent compared with 12 percent in 
june and increased for 25 percent down sharply from 35 percent in 
june 
inventories grew rapidly with 22 percent of the purchasing 
managers reporting higher inventories compared with 18 percent the 
previous month and 18 percent reporting a slowdown in inventory 
growth compared with 22 percent in june 
the group said that accounting for normal seasonal variations 
the rate of inventory increase was the greatest since july 1984 
some of the increase in inventory may be attributed to 
receiving products earlier than required from suppliers who closed 
their plants for vacation and maintenance and as a hedge against 
the significant number of price increases that went into effect 
july 1 the group stated 
in other areas 
prices rose for the 22nd consecutive month although the number 
of managers reporting higher prices declined some 63 percent 
reported higher prices compared with 66 percent in june while 2 
percent reported lower prices in both months 
employment rose for the second straight month after falling for 
three straight months nineteen percent of those surveyed indicated 
their employment rose compared with 20 percent the previous month 
while 12 percent indicated employment fell compared with 16 
percent in june 
vendor deliveries slowed in july a sign of economic growth 
that indicates demand for materials is outpacing manufacturers 
ability to fill orders some 21 percent indicated deliveries from 
their vendors had slowed compared with 32 percent in june 
the national association of purchasing management is a trade 
organization representing 30000 purchasing managers in 21 
industries
