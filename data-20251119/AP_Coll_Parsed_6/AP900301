atlantis streaked toward a sunday 
landing after its crew put into orbit a spy satellite designed to 
fly over parts of the soviet union never before observed from a 
shuttlelaunched craft nasa sources said 
the fiveman allmilitary crew released the 500 million 
37300pound satellite from the shuttles cargo bay thursday a day 
after liftoff the sources said 
the crew is doing well and orbiter atlantis continues to 
perform satisfactorily the space agency said in a statement 
because of a pentagon blackout on the secret mission the only 
other word from nasa was that the shuttle is expected to land 
sunday at edwards air force base calif sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity put landing time at 134 pm est 
nasa technicians planned to spend several days assessing the 
shuttles solid rocket boosters which arrived thursday at a nasa 
hangar at the cape canaveral air force station said agency 
spokesman bruce buckingham 
the boosters dropped off two minutes after launch as expected 
as the spacecraft lifted off early wednesday on the highest 
inclination ever traveled by a shuttle the boosters fell into the 
atlantic 169 miles from kennedy space center and were towed back by 
two ships 
a failed joint in a booster was blamed for the challenger 
disaster in 1986 that killed seven astronauts 
the 62degree inclination allows the satellite to cover most of 
the soviet union including far northern regions with heavy 
concentrations of ships and submarines and several missile bases 
the satellite is designed to take highresolution photographs and 
eavesdrop on electronic communications around the world sources 
said 
the satellite and other reconnaissance spacecraft will be 
important in verifying whether the soviets are complying with 
ussoviet arms agreements the soviets have similar satellites 
over the united states 
atlantis is the sixth of 34 shuttle missions dedicated solely to 
the military 
navy capt john o creighton is atlantis commander the other 
crew members are air force col john h casper the pilot and 
mission specialists marine lt col david c hilmers air force

fire broke out in a luxury hotels tent 
restaurant early thursday and windwhipped flames leaped to the 
main building killing 16 people and injuring about 70 an american 
retiree was among the dead 
frantic guests at the sixstory heliopolis sheraton jumped out 
windows and clambered down bedsheets that were tied together many 
of the injuries were broken bones suffered in falls 
while a us embassy spokeswoman refused to release any 
information on the the victim the american was identified late 
thursday as robert d cresap of houston said his sisterinlaw 
mrs alfred cresap of sioux city iowa 
cresap 67 was a retired accountant who had arrived wednesday 
in cairo with his wife helen his sisterinlaw told the 
associated press in a telephone interview 
three americans were seriously injured said police brig 
abdelrehim elkenawy in the blaze which broke out at 1 am and 
burned for nine hours by early afternoon after the last flames 
had been put out and the smoke extinguished guests were returning 
to retrieve belongings 
as people carried soggy luggage out of the ruined building 
rescue teams were seen carrying out at least four bodies 
the hotel northeast of cairo had no fire alarms or a sprinklers 
and many guests heard of the fire from other guests 
tourism minister fuad sultan said the blaze started accidentally 
in the nubian tent restaurant a cotton canvas tent attached to 
one of the three blocks of the tshaped hotel the head of cairos 
fire brigade maj gen adel nigm said such tents are fire hazards 
and the sheraton put it up without consulting the fire department 
sparks jumped from a clay oven to the ceiling of the tent 
igniting flames that quickly spread to the hotel said sultan 
cairo gov mahmoud sherif told the official middle east news 
agency the use of such tents at hotels would be reviewed a fire 
broke out in a similar tent at the nileside guezira sheraton about 
a year ago but was quickly extinguished with no casualties 
the helioplis sheraton about 10 years old is the only one of 
egypts six sheratons without an alarm system or sprinklers sultan 
said they are not mandatory under egyptian law but most 
firstclass hotels began installing them in 1987 
winds of nearly 25 mph fed the flames which destroyed much of 
the 630room hotel including its restaurants and elaborate lobby 
where live birds flew among tropical plants and trees later in the 
day people crowded around the stillstanding front desk asking 
for passports and belongings 
there were about 1000 guests and 300 employees in the hotel at 
the time of the fire it was not known how many people were inside 
the nubian tent where belly dancing and other entertainment is 
featured 
interior ministry spokesman maj gen bahaa eldin ibrahim said 
the 16 dead included eight french nationals and two finns british 
embassy spokesman james short said four british nationals were 
unaccounted for 
at the hotel a senior security official maj gen ali 
elkubtan said rooms had been 90 percent checked and left open 
the possibility that more victims might be found 
i was at the counter when i saw smoke coming from the 
direction of the nubian tent a hotel receptionist said in 
just five minutes the entire lobby area was on fire the flames 
spread very very quickly 
fred pirkey of atlanta said he was asleep in a sixthfloor room 
when his wife got up and noticed some orange flames outside the 
window from there they made it through the smoke to the third 
floor where a man was tying bedsheets together to attach to a 
windowsill he said 
with his help we got around 20 people down to the roof of the 
ground floor below from where we jumped to safety said pirkey 
57 who is on a twoweek vacation we are very fortunate to be 
alive 
one of those who climbed down the makeshift rope was robert 
louis toohey 72 of battle creek mich he passed out on his way 
down but a man on the ground caught him he was hospitalized for 
smoke inhalation 
one problem was that some guests opened their windows to see 
what was going on said victor lewis assistant manager of the 
cairo sheraton flagship of the chians six hotels in egypt as a 
result sparks went into their rooms driven by the strong winds 
uninjured heliopolis sheraton guests sat together in the lobby 
of a nearby hotel some still in nightclothes 
annick poussard of paris who was sightseeing with her three 
children described the fire as an inferno 
i saw flames from my window she said at first i thought 
they were lights from the nightclub but then the music stopped i 
opened the door and heard people shout fire it was getting hot

its the sandinista peoples army not 
the nicaraguan army its the sandinista police not the national 
police and its commander of the revolution tomas borges personal 
fiefdom not an apolitical interior ministry and secret service 
the name nature and size of nicaraguas powerful and mammoth 
military and paramilitary machine make up perhaps the touchiest 
issue between the unseated sandinista front and the victorious 
united national opposition alliance 
the leftist guerrilla group that has become a political party 
and the coalition led by civilians and business people that swept 
sundays elections each has its own idea of what a countrys army 
and paramilitary forces should be 
and the two ideas could not be further apart 
within the framework established by the political 
constitution the sandinista national liberation front will defend 
the integrity of the sandinista peoples army and the interior 
ministry president daniel ortega told about 15000 sandinista 
supporters tuesday 
coming from the leader of a defeated political party that 
statement alone served to show how much the sandinista front 
regards the army and the ministry as private property 
the crowds reponse was just as telling one single army 
when sandinistas chant people power and one single army 
they mean the merging of party state and army and the generous 
distribution of weapons among the common folk a concept that riles 
civilianminded uno leaders 
weapons are plentiful and easily obtained it seems every 
household has an ak47 or a sovietmade makarov pistol 
the uno government is a government by the will of the people 
and not because of mr ortegas decisions said vice 
presidentelect virgilio godoy let that be very clear 
recruits receive political indoctrination along with military 
training in both institutions which are commonly regarded as two 
separate armies one under ortegas brother defense minister 
humberto ortega and the interior ministry under borge 
the setup was not coincidental 
borge is a hardliner compared to the ortega brothers the two 
sides headed different factions of the sandinista front before the 
july 1979 triumph of the revolution 
once in power lines were drawn and the two forces were 
established under different leaders to balance each other out 
but presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro of uno made a 
campaign promise to trim nicaraguas armed forces the largest in 
central america with an estimated 150000 men and women and a heavy 
drain on state resources taking up to 40 percent of the national 
budget 
uno leaders also want the armed forces depoliticized and the 
name changed to reflect the values of a westernstyle government 
where the armed forces remain in place regardless of which party is 
leading the government 
they want the twoyear draft for boys age 16 dropped 
it reminds nicaraguans of the setup under dictator anastasio 
somoza for whom army police and secret service were all one and 
the same and serving him personally 
borge who will be 60 in august commands fierce personal 
loyalties in the interior ministry 
he is concerned about your wellbeing he listens to you he 
asks about your family you can see that he really cares about 
you a sandinista cadre who occupies an important position in the 
ministry said of borge id follow him anywhere 
each army and ministry unit has a political officer whose rank 
may be lower but whose authority is always higher than the unit 
leader el politicos job is to impart doctrine watch for 
deviations in ideology and handle outside inquiries such as by 
journalists 
the interior ministry controls the sandinista police and also 
cloakanddagger departments such as state security in charge of 
domestic spying foreign and clandestine operations and the 
sinister f8 mass organizations department 
f8 organized the feared turbas shock troops used to break up 
opposition demonstrations and stage spontaneous violent 
protests against sandinista opponents 
president ortega once called them turbas divinas or divine 
mobs and nicaraguans spliced the two words into turbinas or 
turbines a spontaneous attempt by the populace to deal with the 
terror those groups inspire by mocking them 
when ortega threatens opponents with unleashing the peoples 
ire every nicaraguan knows hes refering to the turbinas 
former president jimmy carter who has been mediating between 
uno and the sandinista government to smooth the road to transition 
said gen ortega and borge agreed to step down when mrs chamorro 
is inaugurated april 25 
some nicaraguans veterans of 10 years of sandinista rule are 
skeptical 
they promise you one thing today and if its not in their 
interest tomorrow theyll deny ever having even spoken to you 
said one housewife theyll never give up their weapons thats 
the basis of their power 
she insisted her name not be used such is the feeling of 
intimidation that remains

the writer began covering americas space 
program for the associated press in may 1959 he has covered more 
than 2300 rocket or missile launches including every us manned 
mission on wednesday he retired but not before covering his 65th 
manned space flight 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
appropriately a manned rocket 
blasted off on the day of my retirement i almost believe those who 
kidded me that nasa delayed atlantis all those days so it could be 
that way 
manned rockets have been a great part of my life during the 31 
years i have written about space for the associated press it 
started with the first one alan shepards in 1961 and continued 
through all 64 others as mercury gemini apollo and the space 
shuttle streaked across the pages of history 
i have been fortunate to report on a whole new era of mankind 
the space age from its very outset to the present 
my memories would fill volumes but there are a few most 
happy some very sad that stand out 
there was shepards brief leap across the threshhold of space 
john glenns epic orbital flight in 1962 the rendezvous docking 
and space walk missions of the gemini program that perfected the 
techniques for going to the moon the close call with death that 
neil armstrong and dave scott had when gemini 8 spun out of control 
then there was the 1967 launch pad fire that killed the first 
apollo crew the recovery from the fire and the remarkable series 
of apollo flights including apollo 8s circling of the moon on 
christmas eve that led to mans first landing on the lunar surface 
in 1969 the neartragedy of apollo 13 when an oxygen tank ruptured 
near the moon and three men had to battle for their lives for three 
days to get safely back to earth 
there were the skylab space station flights lasting up to 84 
days the joint ussoviet mission in 1975 the string of 24 space 
shuttle science technology and science delivery and rescue flights 
that ended with that terrible explosion of challenger and the death 
of seven astronauts in january 1986 and there was the rebound 
from that disaster and the beginning of a new string of shuttle 
successes that reached nine with atlantis launch early wednesday 
the public focus has been on the astronaut flights but i hold 
special fondness for the unmanned satellites and spacecraft that 
opened new frontiers and discovered unknown worlds and wondrous 
things out there 
there was the echo in 1960 a giant balloon shining like a star 
in the sky and pointing the way to a communications revolution in 
space the first tiros weather satellite and the startling weather 
photographs it radioed back the early explorer satellites that 
mapped the radiation belts and other phenomena encircling our 
globe the pioneer mariner magellan viking and voyager robots 
that probed the planets revising centuriesold scientific theories 
the highlight of all those years had to be the moment neil 
armstrong and buzz aldrin stepped onto the moons sea of 
tranquillity on sunday july 20 1969 
for eight years ever since president kennedy had set this 
nation on a course to the moon almost everything launched from 
cape canaveral was a stepping stone to that goal mercury proved 
man could survive in space gemini developed the procedures for 
getting there almost every unmanned satellite carried devices to 
measure radiation and other potential hazards along the route the 
unmanned ranger surveyor and lunar orbiter spacecraft scouted the 
lunar landing sites 
when armstrong and aldrin set foot on the moon it didnt hit me 
at first i was too busy writing but hours later as i stepped 
outside the ap office i looked up at the moon felt a lump and 
said by gosh we did it 
yes the memories are there 
after wednesdays atlantis launch several people asked me if i 
would miss it 
yes i said i would for 31 years ive covered one of historys 
best stories but at some point one has to assess his life and say 
its time to move on and make way for someone else to cover the 
history yet to come 
and there is much to come there will be space station freedom 
in the middle of this decade and early in the next century 
astronauts could be back on the moon and embarking for mars 
those will be exciting days and i wish my successor marcia 
dunn the best of luck 
ill still be close to the space program on thursday i will 
change hats and become executive director of the mercury 7 
foundation founded by the six surviving members of the original 
seven astronauts to raise money for science and technology 
scholarships 
i will be located in the new astronaut hall of fame museum just 
outside the gates of the kennedy space center the foundation 
president and my boss will be alan shepard who would have thought 
it 29 years ago when i watched him take wing 
its been a facinating ride

not many 7yearold girls have 
a lawyer a psychiatrist and two names 
hilary foretich the focus of an international custody battle 
does and christchurch has reacted to her plight with the 
protectiveness of an oversized country town 
hilary or ellen morgan as she is known to schoolmates here now 
is the bestknown child in new zealand as well as page one news in 
the united states 
when her maternal grandparents ran away to christchurch to 
harbor the child from her father they chose an apt sanctuary 
not only does new zealands revamped family law system aim to 
act in the best interests of the child at all times so do the 
people of christchurch who have taken hilary to heart 
hilarys mother dr elizabeth morgan sent the child off with 
her parents after a washington dc judge ruled that the girls 
father could have unsupervised visits with hilary 
dr morgan has accused estranged husband eric foretich of 
sexually abusing the child a charge foretich denies she went to 
jail for 25 months rather than reveal the childs whereabouts 
foretich a dentist from falls church va spent more than two 
years trying to track his daughter and his efforts finally paid off 
as private investigators tracked down the girl last month 
he arrived in christchurch today but at the local family 
courts request wont see hilary he says he wants to see his 
daughter but will abide by the courts temporary injunction 
hilary reportedly has not seen either parent for two years her 
mother was released from jail last fall after congress passed a law 
tailored for her that limited imprisonment for civil contempt in 
the district of columbia to a year 
even though hilarys identity became known to her acquaintances 
in late 1989 when a television documentary on her parents bitter 
custody battle was broadcast the people of christchurch were happy 
to keep the secret 
it was a secret that had previously been revealed only to 
hilarys doctor and the headmistress of the exclusive private 
school she has attended since arriving in new zealand in july 1988 
the morgan family said this week that they never lied about 
their identity they just froze people out when they asked 
about ellens background 
foretich would not respond today to the allegations about him 
but said he would try to keep hilarys privacy and dignity 
im not going to get involved in scintillation and 
retaliation he told reporters at christchurch airport before 
being ushered into a waiting car and driven away with journalists 
vehicles in pursuit 
the family court which is to rule on the custody case has 
warned journalists that they could be fined or jailed if they 
publish details of the custody case even prime minister geoffrey 
palmer has become involved warning that us reporters covering 
the case will have to stick to new zealand laws 
new zealands contempt of court laws are starkly different from 
thos in the united states barring any discussion of a case before 
its conclusion so far both sides of the family have taken their 
lawyers advise and kept quiet 
the citizens of christchurch a quiet city with a population of 
under 300000 which lies 190 miles south of wellington have shown 
their displeasure as the foreign media descended on the city this 
week 
not much news comes out of christchurch outside of sheep farming 
the major industry here hotel staff and cab drivers cant recall 
the last time journalists took over the town 
leave the poor wee girl alone leave her alone you 
mongrels are typical remarks along with obscenities shouted to 
journalists staking out hilarys school or home 
even rock star elton john exhorted fans at a christchurch 
concert wednesday night to run the foreign media out of town 
hilarys grandmother antonia morgan said the child was feeling 
haunted by the battery of photographers and journalists 
the christchurch star newspaper commented as perhaps never 
before in its history christchurch is the center of international 
media attention the matter raises anew the recurring question of 
how far the media should go in fulfilling their duty to report the 
facts to the public 
the media in new zealand could not ignore a subject of such 
major human interest when it suddenly landed on their doorstep 
inevitably hilary is a victim of such attention 
the public have been given enough by now to meet any 
reasonable appetite for information hilarys story and her 
parents stories have been told from many angles now for the 
childs sake if for no other the matter should be left for the 
courts to decide

a strong earthquake rocked a 200mile 
swath of southern california on wednesday triggering rock slides 
onto highways causing scattered structural damage and frightening 
thousands 
two people suffered broken legs and a woman went into early 
labor said city councilman tom mcgilloway uplands acting mayor 
the quake had a magnitude of 55 on the richter scale 
the temblor felt from san diego to santa barbara and swayed 
highrise buildings in las vegas 230 miles to the east sent 70 
people fleeing a collapsing warehouse wall and forced evacuation of 
patients from a hospital 
it was the most severe temblor in california since the october 
1989 earthquake in the san francisco bay area that killed 67 people 
and awakened fears of the massive quake scientist predict in the 
state in coming years 
in terms of ground shaking it was about 40 times less severe 
than the world series quake which measured 71 said lucile jones 
of the us geological service 
aftershocks of varying magnitude occurred hours after the 
earthquake the strongest a 48 shaker that rattled the upland 
city hall where the city council was meeting to discuss measures to 
take in the aftermath of the quake struck at 724 pm 
the quake centered three miles northwest of upland and about 40 
miles east of los angeles struck at 343 pm and was measured at 
55 on the richter scale on instruments at the california institute 
of technology in pasadena 
the us geological survey gave the same magnitude but a 
preliminary reading by university of california seismographic 
stations at berkeley put the magnitude at 60 such measuring 
differences are common a quake of magnitude 55 is capable of 
causing considerable damage 
scattered damage was reported in the region east of los angeles 
in la verne a few miles from the epicenter 70 workers fled as 
a wall collapsed at a warehouse workers leaped out windows and 
dove off a loading dock but no one was seriously hurt even though 
two workers were pulling stock along the 20foot by 80foot wall at 
the time 
everything happened so fast trying to get 70 people out of the 
warehouse its amazing nobody got seriously hurt said supervisor 
stan sokolowski 
pomona valley hospital evacuated 60 patients due to broken water 
lines said nancy hardaker spokeswoman for the state office of 
emergency services the hospital could not be reached by phone 
at harvey mudd college in claremont about five miles from the 
epicenter the quake broke a window and toppled wallmounted 
bookcases in the presidents office said burt tashman at the 
school 
im on the second story and boy i tell you things started 
shaking tashman said glass fell from the wall of the 
presidents office and fell all over the place pictures fell the 
pane broke that sort of thing 
windows shattered at city halls in upland and nearby pomona 
at ontario international airport a few miles from the 
epicenter ceiling panels and signs fell and windows cracked in 
the operations tower said manager michael digirolamo 
a small rock slide on interstate 10 in pomona not far from the 
epicenter startled motorists causing minor accidents the highway 
patrol said another small rockslide closed the road through 
soledad canyon 35 miles northwest of los angeles 
a boulder twice the size of a car fell onto angeles crest 
highway in the san gabriel mountains blocking half of the twolane 
rural road 
the san francisco area quake struck oct 17 as the third game 
of the world series was about to begin in addition to the 67 
deaths the quake injured about 3000 people and did 7 billion in 
damage 
the worst recent southern california quake struck the whittier 
area oct 1 1987 it measured 59 on the richter scale and 
together with a 53magnitude aftershock oct 4 killed eight 
people injured more than 200 and caused 358 million in damage 
wednesdays quake felt as a rolling motion in los angeles came 
three hours after a smaller quake in the same area 
the main shock was followed by 16 aftershocks of magnitude 23 
or greater within 2 hours caltech said 
several hours after the main quake the state office of 
emergency services issued a carefully worded advisory saying that a 
quake as large as or somewhat larger could occur in the area 
the agency pointedly noting that no specific prediction had 
been made said authorities in san bernardino riverside los 
angeles and orange counties had been advised to remain prepared 
us geological survey scientist lucile jones said that based on 
historical records of past california earthquakes there was a 5 
percent chance the main shock would be followed by a larger quake 
within three days however the odds drop off rapidly so that by 
thursday morning the likelihood of such a quake probably would be 
at most 2 or 3 percent she said 
southern california edison said 6000 electrical customers lost 
power but only 1300 remained without service 90 minutes after the 
main shock 
southern california edison co operators of the san onofre 
nuclear generating station just south of san clemente reported an 
unusual event to the nuclear regulatory commission 
both reactors at the plant continued to run and power supply was 
uninterrupted said edison spokesman bob goodlow an unusual 
event is the lowest of four emergency designations for nuclear 
plants 
phone service to thousands of customers was disrupted but cati 
flynn of pacific bell said it was likely caused by callers jamming 
lines 
it felt like somebody picked up the building and dropped it a 
couple of times said police lt don manning at the station in 
nearby ontario where false ceilings fell it was like we went up 
a foot then down a foot then up again 
broken windows and minor structural damage were reported in 
ontario manning said the worst to an old threestory brick 
theater and office building 
we had a dandy earthquake it was a bumpy jerky kind of 
earthquake said holly jones of hacienda heights a los angeles 
suburb my china cabinet and several glasses fell out and broke 
it was felt as far north as santa barbara nearly 100 miles 
northwest of los angeles and as far south as san diego 150 miles 
to the south it was also felt in palm springs 100 miles to the 
east 
people reported feeling the quake in barstow in the mojave 
desert and bakersfield at the south end of the san joaquin valley 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 
6 severe damage a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage 
the san francisco earthquake of 1906 which occurred before the 
richter scale was devised has been estimated at 83 on the richter 
scale

the earthquake that rumbled across 
southern california on wednesday was another reminder that the 
state straddles two gigntic plates of earths constantly moving 
crust 
california sits on the boundary between the pacific and north 
american plates which are moving with respect to each other at 
about two inches per year said kate hutton a seismologist at 
the california institute of technology 
that motion causes strain or deformation to happen in the 
crust when something snaps under that strain its an 
earthquake she said 
wednesdays earthquake considered moderate with a magnitude of 
55 on the richter scale was felt from san diego to santa barbara 
two people suffered broken legs and a woman went into early labor 
in upland near the epicenter and there was scattered structural 
damage 
sixteen aftershocks strong enough to be felt occurred within 2 
hours of the 343 pm main shock and a 48 aftershock struck at 
724 pm the state office of emergency services issued an advisory 
saying equally strong or more powerful aftershocks could occur over 
the next three days 
the pacific plate underlies the pacific ocean and much of 
southern california it is slowly grinding northwest past the north 
american plate which underlies the rest of the continent 
the 600mile san andreas fault generally is considered the 
boundary between the two plates but the plate motion also triggers 
earthquakes on a complicated series of faults that riddle 
california 
the movement of the pacific plate creates many parallel faults 
that run northwest to southeast and include the san andreas the 
san jacinto and a series of offshore faults 
but others including the unnamed fault that caused wednesdays 
quake run perpendicular to the plate motion or from northeast to 
southwest those faults also are created by the plate movements 
both types of faults are known as strikeslip faults in which 
ground on one side of a fault moves horizontally past ground on the 
other side 
californias seismic map is even more complex as it slides past 
the north american plate the pacific plate also presses against it 
that compression can cause thrust faults where ground on one 
side of a fault moves vertically with respect to ground on the 
other side 
thrust fault motion has caused several destructive earthquakes 
in california in recent years including the 1987 whittier narrows 
quake east of los angeles the 1983 coalinga earthquake in the san 
joaquin valley and the 1971 san fernando earthquake that killed at 
least 58 people in the los angeles area 
a strikeslip jolt wednesdays earthquake occurred three miles 
northwest of upland at the base of the san gabriel mountains which 
themselves were created by compressive thrust motion it was 
centered at least 15 miles from any of the regions major faults 
said lucile jones of the us geological survey 
until the whittier quake which with a major aftershock killed 
eight people scientists thought the major seismic threat in 
california was posed by strikeslip quakes but whittier made them 
realize that hidden thrust faults may pose an equal or more serious 
threat regardless of the type of earthquake 
wednesdays jolt is a reminder of the seismically active area 
we live in said paul flores of the california office of 
emergency services 
the shaking most people felt was minor as opposed to what we 
know can happen therefore people need to take the necessary 
precautions to prepare in reducing hazards at home and in the 
workplace

tchaikovksys the maid of orleans was 
presented at carnegie hall by the opera orchestra of new york 
founded 20 years ago by eve queler to perform concert versions of 
rarely heard operas 
the performance wednesday the title role brilliantly sung by 
mezzosoprano delora zajick followed one last saturday by the same 
orchestra at brooklyn college that one with a different cast was 
called the new york premiere of the opera and the us premiere of 
the opera in russian 
the maid of orleans has some glorious music especially in 
the first two of the four acts the libretto reads as though there 
isnt much action so a concert version may be the best way to hear 
it 
and in this opera joan of arc isnt burned at the stake 
because of an accusation of witchcraft but because she falls in 
love with and doesnt kill the last english officer left alive 
other englishmen kill him as a traitor and capture her 
joan is a wonderful role for mezzosoprano and miss zajick made 
the most of it she has a big voice which can pour forth a solid 
column of sound and she can sing with sweet softness at any 
volume she has a purity of sound appropriate for joan 
near the end of act 1 she has an aria saying goodby to the 
fields of home in the incredibly melodic ending to act 2 she has 
another wonderful aria recounting her visions 
the other two outstanding voices in the cast were soprano marvis 
martin in a rather small role as the french kings mistress and 
finnish baritone jorma hynninen as the english officer we also 
liked tenor fan jingma who began his musical studies in china 
singing joans early suitor and bass sergei koptchak of 
czechoslovakia who sang her father 
miss queler obviously knew what she wanted from the music and 
her orchestra responded glowingly to her conducting the new york 
choral society directed by john daly goodwin was the excellent 
large chorus on stage a band of minstrels also is called for and 
the yale russian chorus led by davidmarc finley took that role 
arriving down an aisle and crossing in front of the stage singing 
with harmonious blend as they went 
heavenly voices and trumpets were heard several times during the 
evening from the top balcony

western journalists pledged fellowships and advice 
on circulation and advertising to help their east bloc colleagues 
develop an independent press 
at a conference wednesday a un agency also backed a polish 
proposal to establish an center in warsaw dedicated to training a 
new generation of journalists in independent reporting and helping 
to nurture a free press 
hardline communist rulers in bulgaria czechoslovakia east 
germany hungary poland and romania had manipulated reporting for 
decades but with the popular upheaval that toppled them last year 
came a demand for independent journalism 
in several east bloc countries fledgling independent newspapers 
are competing with wellfunded organs still under communist control 
at a twoday unesco meeting eastern european journalists sought 
everything from typewriters to printing presses from western 
colleagues 
the editor of the swiss magazine hebdo jacques pilet put the 
western reponse succinctly when he said dont expect a sudden 
shower of dollars or trucks rolling in with bales of newsprint 
but he said there is a real desire to help with training and 
advice 
the poynter institute of st petersburg fla a private 
foundation offered eight fully funded fellowships to journalists 
from the east bloc 
representatives from usa today the times of london and the 
british newspaper the guardian said they would look into getting 
information to eastern european news people on the training of 
personnel in advertising and circulation as well as in journalism 
the un educational scientific and cultural organization is 
going to try to establish a network of contacts exchanges and 
information on training and media operations said its information 
director alain modoux 
he also said unesco decided to provide 20000 to establish the 
central european center for communication in warsaw the 
international federation of journalists said it would contribute 
another 10000 to start the school 
other east bloc journalists also supported the school said 
katarzyna kolodziejczy of the polish journalists association 
at a news conference following wednesdays end to the meeting 
modoux did not say what action if any unesco would take in 
response to the apparent decision by soviet authorities to bar 
independent journalist sergei grigoryants from traveling to paris 
to attend the conference 
grigoryants sent unesco a telegram in which he said that 
although he had a french visa his passport was confiscated an hour 
before his departure he blamed the kgb for the move 
this incident which is usual in the ussr once again 
emphasizes the real value of numerous soviet statements about 
widening contacts with the west his message said he said it 
also emphasized the difference between the official and independent 
press in the soviet union 
leaders from official soviet publications such as ogonyok 
magazine editorinchief vitaly korotich and vladislav a starkov 
editor of the weekly newspaper arguments and facts participated in 
the conference

weeks before the start of imelda marcos 
racketeering trial a banker accused of helping the former 
philippine first lady transfer stolen funds has struck a plea 
bargain and agreed to help prosecutors 
rodolfo t arambulo pleaded guilty in federal court wednesday to 
the lesser charge of conspiracy to commit mail fraud 
arambulo 57 is the former president of the california overseas 
bank a los angelesbased bank indicted with arambulo mrs marcos 
the late ferdinand marcos and saudi financier adnan khashoggi in 
the racketeering case in 1988 
mrs marcos trial with her codefendants begins march 20 
arambulo a fugitive until his surrender monday to fbi agents in 
new york admitted to a scheme to fraudulently obtain insurance 
from the federal deposit insurance corp for the bank which 
prosecutors say was secretly owned by marcos 
assistant us attorney charles labella would not say whether 
arambulo would be called as a witness at mrs marcos trial but 
his cooperation agreement said he would be required to testify at 
proceedings related to the case 
the conspiracy charge against arambulo carries up to five years 
in prison and a 250000 fine the indictment had charged him with 
racketeering and racketeering conspiracy which carry up to 20 
years in prison each 
the indictment accuses the marcoses of siphoning more than 100 
million from the philippine treasury to buy new york city real 
estate and art they also were charged with embezzling 165 million 
from several banks 
marcos died in exile in hawaii on sept 28 at age 72 
arambulos plea came after us district judge john keenan 
refused to dismiss the indictment against mrs marcos on a claim 
that she and her husband were abducted from their homeland by us 
officials during his overthrow in 1986 
the judge noted that the marcoses were accompanied to hawaii by 
an entourage of 122 
this was more akin to a troop movement than a kidnapping he 
said 
mrs marcos had claimed that at no time did she agree to leave 
the country 
in rejecting the kidnapping claim keenan quoted a statement by 
marcos two days after their arrival in hawaii in which the ousted 
dictator said he was there under the hospitality of the us 
government

bench warfare has broken out in the citys 
subways as the transit authority yanks seats from stations to 
force the slumbering homeless to find other accommodations 
not all stations just in those where officials say the 
homeless congregate using benches as places to sleep and worse 
these benches are not used by the general public said 
transit authority spokesman bob slovak these are benches that 
have been taken over by the homeless benches that have been 
defecated on urinated on 
the effort started last week when 10 benches were removed from 
three stations the program drew immediate condemnations from an 
unusual coalition of homeless advocates and commuter groups 
moe larry and curly really are running the mta said keith 
summa advocacy director of the coalition for the homeless 
what the transit authority has to do is acknowledge that 
homeless folks arent going to go away unless they are helped with 
housing and increased rehabilitation facilities said joseph 
rappaport coordinator of the straphangers campaign a commuter 
group 
the program was conceived by a task force formed to shore up 
operation enforcement a program to improve subway ambience 
when operation enforcement began in october the transit 
authority and its parent the metropolitan transportation 
authority said they intended to enforce strictly a ban on 
littering panhandling and loitering 
the program has lagged from the start police say for the record 
that they support operation enforcement but privately they admit 
that in a transit system plagued by a record number of felonies 
last year they have no energy or time to go after beggars or 
loiterers 
transit authority officials insist that they are not persecuting 
the homeless they point to programs they have launched to persuade 
homeless people in the subways a population estimated at 2500 by 
the authority and at 4000 to 5000 by homeless advocates to find 
shelter elsewhere 
gilbert morales who lived in the subways for seven years 
scoffs at any suggestion that authorities have the best interests 
of the homeless at heart 
they just want to get the homeless out on the street said 
morales who now has a home and a job as a messenger if the city 
shelters were safer people would get out of the train stations 
commuters he said never used the benches anyway many other 
homeless people said they didnt use the benches either that the 
tunnels and crannies of the subway system are more likely homes to 
the homeless 
mike who has spent the past year in the subways sat on a 
plastic milk crate in grand central terminal near the subway 
entrance mike along with police and others disputed assertions 
that the homeless left bodily waste on the benches 
the best places to sleep are the tunnels he said despite 
warnings that the tunnels are dangerous 
its heated brother believe me but you have to know where 
they are mike said 
as for the removal of the benches it aint going to prove 
nothing theyre just going to sleep on the floor mike said 
they aint doing anything but hurting the commuters 
some commuters were eager to give up the seats take them 
out said one woman who would not give her name theyre 
disgusting 
but sharon gary who lives near a station where benches have 
been removed said the removal of the benches was horrible the 
homeless she said caused no safety problem besides she said 
she had a real heavy backpack and i need some place to put it 
they dont seem to have a policy its piecemeal said 
sidney feldman a communications consultant as he passed through 
grand central the basic problem is they dont have any place for 
the homeless to go where they feel safe they just move them 
around 
that say homeless advocates like summa is the problem 
summa said that similar efforts to dislocate the homeless were 
unsuccessful in grand central also run by the mta where benches 
were removed or closed off and ammonia poured into telephone booths 
to keep loiterers from settling in 
homeless people are still there summa said the ta has to 
relearn everything that was learned at grand central 
he said the only way to get rid of homeless people is to 
provide additional services a decent place for them to go

these are the prime times that try cbs soul 
preliminary ratings from the justended february sweeps period 
show the network still in last place facing its third consecutive 
season as no 3 
but as expected firstplace nbc scored its eighth straight 
victory in the sweeps averaging a 151 rating handily beating the 
130 average of abc cbs averaged a 126 each rating point 
represents 921000 homes 
the sweeps period that ended wednesday is one of four periods of 
audience measurement in 211 cities by the ac nielsen co the 
results are important to local stations which use them to help set 
advertising rates 
on wednesday alan wurtzel abc senior vice president for 
research said the nielsen returns he provided lacked the last two 
days of the february sweeps period but i dont see any major 
changes in the outcome 
he spoke at a news conference smiliar sessions to discuss the 
sweeps race are being held here today by nbc and abc executives 
speaking of the ratings slide of the oncedominant cbs evening 
news and the rise of abcs world news tonight wurtzel 
predicted that the latters string of victories will continue 
abcs broadcast anchored by peter jennings has won the ratings 
race for seven consecutive weeks and been victorious in 19 of the 
last 20 weeks according to abc 
the cbs evening news with dan rather has been in third place 
for five of the last eight weeks and tied once this year with tom 
brokaws nbc evening news for second place cbs estimates show 
in essence what we see is that cbs and nbc will be fighting 
it out for second place position for some time to come wurtzel 
said 
on another matter he said its simplistic to think that the 
andy rooney controversy and rooneys suspension from cbs 60 
minutes caused that toprated shows drop in the ratings for the 
past three weeks 
wurtzel said he had no research that would show if the dispute 
caused the decline but its very simplistic and onedimensional 
to think that any one event triggers things like that i think its 
a much more complicated thing 
on feb 8 cbs news suspended rooney for three months without 
pay after a gay magazine attributed racial remarks to him the 
humorist denied making any such statements 
in ratings for the week before his suspension 60 minutes 
was fifth then it slipped to 10th place then 11th last week it 
was no 18 beaten in its time period sunday by a rerun of the 
premiere of abcs americas funniest home videos 
however michael eisenberg a cbs research vice president said 
that abcs sunday show drew viewers because americas funniest 
home videos now a highrated series is a pretty hot show and 
would do well wherever you put it 
he noted that 60 minutes still is sixth in ratings averages 
for the season to date averaging a 20 rating and 33 per cent share 
of audience 
wurtzel ducked a question on whether he thought cbs show is 
going to continue to decline in the ratings 
noting that 60 minutes has been on the air since 1968 he 
said its still a strong show but i dont think im surprised to 
see that theres been a certain amount of slippage 
he cited as factors the cyclical nature of television and 
competition against cbs newsmagazine series from an enormous 
proliferation of similar types of programs in recent months

senate democrats are the winners in the years 
first congressional faceoff over the peace dividend as both 
parties signal they want to use the money to help their own core 
supporters 
the chambers majority democrats won a pair of votes wednesday 
on a topic expected to dominate this years budget battle what to 
do with funds siphoned from the pentagon as the cold war thaws 
the socalled peace dividend would be used to whittle down the 
federal deficit according to a democratic measure the chamber 
adopted 7919 that would make cuts in social programs which 
democrats traditionally protect less likely as congress seeks 
ways to reduce the federal deficit 
senators rejected 5048 a republican alternative that called for 
the money to be used for tax cuts the gop plan called for lowering 
the capital gains tax rate and extending corporate tax breaks for 
research leading democrats to label the proposal an effort to help 
the wealthy 
both measures were nonbinding resolutions meaning the votes 
were symbolic but the afternoons maneuverings highlighted the 
themes the two parties are likely to employ throughout the year 
its going to be up to congress to carve out a peace 
dividend said sen james sasser dtenn a sponsor of the 
democratic measure and chairman of the senate budget committee 
that was sassers way of chiding president bush for proposing a 
pentagon budget of 2921 billion for fiscal 1991 which starts 
oct 1 that figure is 53 billion higher than this years total 
but 39 billion less than would be needed to stay even with 
inflation 
sen phil gramm rtexas sponsor of the gop proposal argued 
that the democratic plan simply would allow the government to spend 
the money 
that would be a throwback to the failed policies of the 
past gramm said 
underpinning wednesdays debate was the grammrudman deficit 
reduction law which gramm helped write and which sets a 64 
billion target for next years budget shortfall that means 
congress and the white house will have to find about 37 billion in 
savings or face automatic spending cuts in most programs 
if defense spending is cut and the money is used to reduce the 
deficit as democrats want there would be less pressure to slash 
domestic programs 
but if defense savings are distributed to taxpayers as the 
republicans proposed there would be nowhere else to turn for 
savings but domestic programs 
the rejected gop proposal called for the savings to be 
returned to americas taxpayers in the form of lower tax rates 
a refundable child care tax credit a larger tax break for 
corporate research and development and other breaks 
who can we trust to invest in americas future the federal 
government or the families of america gramm asked 
but democrats accused the gop of favoring tax advantages for the 
rich the democratic plan said that besides deficit reduction some 
savings should be spent on national problems such as education and 
drugs and for tax breaks for working men and women 
we need to take this peace dividend and we need to apply these 
funds wisely sasser said 
the term peace dividend can be misleading with the 
government running persistent deficits reductions in the 
pentagons budget will not leave the government with surplus 
dollars to spend 
the congressional budget office projects next years deficit 
will be 138 billion most democrats and some republicans want 
defense cut below bushs proposal but few of them want those 
reductions to exceed a few billion dollars next year 
the savings will grow in coming years however as highprice 
weapons systems and other projects that take several years to build 
fall by the wayside 
in the face of certain approval of the democratic proposal 25 
republicans joined 54 democrats voting for passage seven 
republicans then joined 43 democrats in rejecting the gop measure

us pollsters who anticipated an election 
triumph for daniel ortega say they failed to take account of the 
distrust ordinary nicaraguans might have for strangers with 
clipboards asking questions 
nor did us policymakers anticipate that the polls would turn 
out to be so skewed secretary of state james a baker iii in the 
days before sundays elections allowed himself to be drawn into 
speculation about us policy toward a postelection ortega 
government 
we shouldnt assume this baker said in an appearance before 
a congressional hearing but he went on to lay out on the 
assumption that ortega would win tough terms the sandinistas 
would have to meet before normal relations could be restored 
the expectation that ortega would overwhelm his opponent 
violeta barrios de chamorro colored television coverage too 
said nbcs ed rabel from managua on feb 21 over a picture of 
ortega this is the man pollsters say who will be elected 
overwhelmingly this weekend the election observers say the 
bush administration may have itself to blame for daniel ortegas 
rise in popularity among the votes the reason they say is the 
us military invasion in panama it was a close race until the 
us invaded 
almost certainly said ted koppel of abc two nights later 
the sandinistas will still win 
postelection analysis showed that polls conducted by 
organizations from venezuela argentina and costa rica correctly 
saw mrs chamorro as the leader 
in fact the washington post noted of 27 polls released in the 
last months of 1989 and this year 14 showed the sandinistas ahead 
and 13 gave the lead to mrs chamorros coalition 
but the big american polls pointed to an ortega landslide 
the washington postabc news poll had ortega leading by 48 
percent to 32 percent with the rest scattered undecided or 
unwilling to declare themselves a poll conducted for the 
spanishlanguage television network univision had ortega ahead 
5335 a poll conducted for hemisphere initiative an observer 
group by greenberglakes associates put the sandinistas in the 
lead 4427 in december and 5134 in late january 
when nicaraguans voted sunday they turned those polls on their 
heads mrs chamorro won overwhelmingly 55 percent to 41 percent 
many of the people we interviewed in nicaragua were simply 
unwilling to allow themselves to be identified as an enemy of the 
sandinista government says rob schroth of bendixen amp schroth 
which took the univision poll 
in nicaragua the government plays a very major role in the 
everyday lives of the average citizen and people simply werent 
going to take any chances that interviewers might be agents for the 
government schroth said 
then too the government prohibited the release of polls in the 
30 days before the election when antisandinista sentiment may 
have been coalescing behind mrs chamorro 
mark penn who has worked extensively in latin america but did 
not poll in nicaragua said the situation was too unstable for 
accurate polling 
polling is helpful in a stable democracy but in a place where 
there is no history of democracy it is unreliable he said you 
are going to have to say there are limits to polling 
some analysts say the election was cast in pro or 
antisandinista terms with insufficient attention paid to economic 
discontent 
no government associated with hyperinflation is going to win 
an election said laurence birns executive director of the 
council on hemispheric affairs a liberal research group critical 
of us policy toward nicaragua for all that birns miscalculated 
he predicted a narrow sandinista win 
pollster stanley greenberg of greenberglake associates says 
ortega may have lost the election in the last few weeks 
he conducted a glitzy americanstyle campaign and it 
backfired said greenberg 
ortega put himself in a losing proposition greenberg said by 
asking voters to choose between his own austere personality and 
mrs chamorros warmth 
our surveys showed a large bloc trying to preserve what the 
sandinistas had brought and worrying that the opposition would turn 
the clock back but once the sandinista campaign centered on the 
cult of personality once the advertising was rock music and the 
youth culture i wonder if the campaign didnt trivialize the 
issues greenberg said

not expect opposition presidential candidate violeta chamorro to 
win a senior official says 
nobody has a clue how much money is needed to get mrs 
chamorros new government started and help her impoverished 
countrys economy begin to recover from a decade of war and 
misguided economic policies said an administration official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
youve really got a basket case the official said 
wednesday its going to take a toptobottom look at what the 
government needs to get back on its feet 
the bush administration will begin by waiving trade sanctions 
imposed on nicaragua in 1985 and perhaps other inexpensive and 
largely symbolic actions designed to indicate support for mrs 
chamorro the official said 
members of congress have suggested the united states begin by 
pouring 200 million to 300 million into nicaragua this year but 
the administration will be unable to come up with its own 
recommendation before mrs chamorro is sworn in as president april 
25 the official said 
meanwhile secretary of state james a baker iii declared 
wednesday in testimony on capitol hill that the war is over in 
nicaragua despite lingering mistrust by longtime foes 
president bush held what he called a constructive telephone 
conversation with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev on a range 
of issues that included nicaragua bush said later in a speech that 
from moscow to managua change is in the air 
the world has undergone another upheaval but this time there 
is no war and there are fewer tyrants in the world than before 
bush said at a san francisco fundraiser for sen pete wilson 
rcalif who is running for governor 
the president called gorbachev whom the administration credits 
with playing an important role in encouraging free elections in 
nicaragua a bold leader who was undertaking daring reforms 
in managua officials began to address the problems of the 
countrys first peaceful transfer of power to a democratically 
elected government including how to demobilize the usbacked 
contra rebels who have been fighting the leftist government since 
1981 
president daniel ortega said in a wednesday interview on the 
macneillehrer newshour that the nicaraguan elections occurred 
under a threat from the united states 
the us was virtually saying to the nicaraguan people if you 
dont vote for uno the opposition then the war and the economic 
sanctions are going to continue 
in contrast he said the soviet union has been respectful of 
the sovereign decision of the nicaraguan people 
ortega said the sandinistas will support everything in the uno 
government that is geared toward the national interests toward the 
peoples interests 
former president jimmy carter who led a large election observer 
group and mediated between the two sides after the voting met with 
baker on wednesday and called on the rebels to lay down their arms 
carter said what happens to the contras was the key unresolved 
factor in nicaragua 
if you have an army on the edge of your country or in your 
country that still threatens military action thats obviously a 
very destabilizing factor carter told reporters i dont think 
there is going to be a guarantee of an orderly transition as long 
as the contras are a military force threatening the country 
baker in his testimony wednesday noted that a bipartisan 
policy agreement between the administration and congress last year 
called for voluntary reintegration of the rebels under safe and 
democratic conditions 
with sundays election victory by mrs chamorro and a request by 
her and ortega for the rebels to disband baker said those 
conditions are now rapidly being created 
however he added that years of distrust had produced 
legitimate fears on both sides that should be addressed 
baker said he hoped roman catholic cardinal miguel obando y 
bravo in managua would be able to play a role in resolving this 
issue along with the united nations and the organization of 
american states 
carter also seemed optimistic having spoken with most of the 
sandinista leaders including defense minister humberto ortega 
carter said the chamorroled national opposition union and the 
sandinistas were working harmoniously on a transition of power 
carter said the sandinistas acknowledged the results of the 
election as well as mrs chamorros right to choose her own 
ministers of defense and interior which control the army and 
security forces 
still he said the contras who fought with american weapons and 
money to bring down the sandinistas had legitimate concerns that 
must be met

the bush administrations request for an 
emergency 500 million to restart panamas stalled economy is 
catching trouble from several directions on capitol hill even 
before it comes up for formal consideration 
bush requested the aid in a feb 6 letter to house speaker 
thomas s foley dwash proposig to pay for the assistance by 
borrowing from several pentagon accounts 
but the proposal ran into problems with members of congress 
whose pet defense programs and projects would be affected by the 
money transfer and that sent the bill back to the drawing board 
there were massive problems up and down the list said one 
administration official speaking on condition of anonymity but 
the official said the attempted cuts of congressional projects had 
been no accident 
on wednesday sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the 
appropriations subcommittee which deals with foreign aid vowed 
that he would cut the aid sharply because it was too much to give 
to panama 
i guarantee you thats not going to happen leahy said 
referring to the aid package there will be no half a billion 
dollars in that supplemental for panama 
i wouldnt support that and im not sure many others will 
he said in an interview nobody ever asked anybody up here on 
capitol hill do you think its a good idea i think somebody just 
had a speech to make 
he added im getting very very concerned that our foreign 
policy especially in the foreign aid area is being conducted more 
on symbolism than on what should be the goals of the united 
states 
leahy said lawmakers would prefer to give some of the money if 
it is available to emerging new democracies in eastern europe and 
he would like to see more go to meet humanitarian needs in africa 
leahy said 
he said he told deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger 
the administration should put the brakes on making aid promises to 
new democratic governments including the newly elected opposition 
coalition in nicaragua 
as far as panama is concerned congress will expect to see 
progress made toward reforming the countrys tight bank secrecy 
laws that have provided cover for drug money laundering and toward 
a new and more benign role for the panama defense forces leahy 
said 
the supplemental appropriation measure for panama likely will be 
an attractive target for lawmakers looking for a mustpass vehicle 
for other pet proposals 
leahy and sen robert kasten rwis want to add 400 million 
in credits for israel to build housing for an influx of soviet 
emigres and sen joseph biden ddel announced plans wednesday 
to add 125 million to encourage farmers in peru bolivia and 
colombia to grow something besides the coca leaf used to make 
cocaine 
despite the problems the bush administration believes it 
eventually will win passage of some money to help panama pay 
pastdue debts and restart its stalled economy well get less 
than we wanted but more than leahy wants to give us the 
administration official said

the manhattan district attorney says no charges 
will be brought against the rev bruce ritter despite dubious 
financial dealings by the founder of the nations largest network 
of runaway shelters 
the roman catholic priest resigned as head of covenant house on 
tuesday amid allegations of financial and sexual misconduct 
involving young runaways 
ritter 62 was involved in some questionable financial 
transactions in his expenditures for a male prostitute district 
attorney robert morgenthau said wednesday 
morgenthau also said the law may have been violated when 
covenant house supplied the 26yearold prostitute kevin kite 
with a false identity using the papers of a dead 10yearold 
but in neither circumstance was there enough evidence to file 
charges said morgenthau who declined to elaborate on what his 
investigators found to be questionable in ritters financial 
dealings 
morgenthau said he was not concerned with sexual misconduct 
because kite is an adult and the allegations involving other youths 
were beyond the statute of limitations the sexual allegations are 
the subject of a church investigation 
nothing in the probe cast into doubt the merits of covenant 
houses programs which are widely and deservedly praised 
morgenthau said 
although covenant house has had to endure a brief period of 
adversity i am confident that it will emerge from this episode a 
stronger and more effective organization he said 
ritter first put a few runaways up at his apartment in 1968 
covenant house now has 17 shelters in the united states canada and 
latin america that care for 25000 children nearly all of its 85 
million budget comes from donations 
a private audit has concluded that money spent on kite was 
properly documented and appeared to be appropriate to covenant 
houses mission 
former new york schools chancellor frank macchiarola who had 
been running convenant house since ritter took a leave of absence 
feb 6 also resigned tuesday 
macchiarola said he was forced out because he advocated outside 
investigations into allegations of wrongdoing at covenant house 
i was the guy with the light and they said you know what its 
too bright in here he said 
but board chairman ralph a pfeiffer jr said the board has 
begun implementing macchiarolas suggestions including an audit 
and an investigation by a former law enforcement official of any 
allegations concerning covenant house staff 
the board named james j harnett the executive vice president 
to run the organization until a permanent successor is found 
published reports have said contributions to covenant house have 
dropped since the allegations against ritter surfaced but harnett 
said the organization was in good financial condition

sharp declines for milk and eggs helped push 
down the agriculture departments monthly commodity price index in 
february according to preliminary figures 
lower prices for lettuce and wheat also contributed to last 
months drop of 06 percent from the january average the 
departments agricultural statistics board said wednesday even so 
the index averaged 27 percent above the yearearlier level 
higher prices for cattle broilers and tomatoes partly offset 
the decline for the other commodities during the month 
tomato prices for february were at the highest level of 
records the report said during the past two months prices 
have been about twice the previous record established in march of 
1985 
the price climb was due to short supplies caused by the december 
freeze in florida in december the report said 
the drop in milk prices paid to farmers which had been at 
record levels was the largest monthtomonth decline ever 
recorded the egg price drop was said to be the thirdlargest on 
record 
the report did not include new figures on farm expenses which 
are computed every three months in january however new quarterly 
figures showed that prices paid by farmers were up 11 percent from 
october the previous reading and averaged 29 percent more than a 
year earlier 
department economists say the net cash income of farmers in 1990 
may be in the range of 52 billion to 57 billion compared with 
about 53 billion in 1989 
net cash income is the money nationally that farmers have left 
from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash 
expenses it includes government payments and proceeds from crops 
grown previously but sold during the year 
in another method taking into account changes in inventories 
depreciation and other allowances during a calendar year shows that 
1990 net farm income may be in a range of 44 billion to 49 
billion compared with 48 billion last year 
consumer food prices are forecast by usda economists to rise 3 
percent to 5 percent this year after posting an average gain of 57 
percent in 1989 the sharpest rise since 1981 
based on the preliminary figures the february price index for 
livestock and poultry was down 06 percent from january but was up 
82 percent from february 1989 
milk prices dropped 80 cents from january to 1490 per 100 
pounds but were still 180 more than a year ago

food processors will have to be more specific 
on their labels when certain flavorings are used in meat and 
poultry products the agriculture department says 
federal rules are being changed effective today to require 
proteinaceous material derived from livestock poultry eggs 
milk plants and yeast to be listed on labels by their names 
in the past such substances could be listed simply as 
flavorings or similar terms 
for example a popular flavor agent or enhancer used for 
years in hot dogs will have to be labeled milk protein 
hydrolyzate 
lester m crawford administrator of the departments food 
safety and inspection service said wednesday that the new rule 
proposed in august 1987 was adopted to better protect the public 
health and serve the consumers right to know whats in food 
products 
for many years the agency has required labels for meat and 
poultry products to list all ingredients he said however an 
exception was made to allow natural flavoring and similar terms 
to designate substances which are often added as flavor enhancers 
emulsifiers stabilizers binders extenders and nutrient sources 
in products such as frankfurters and bologna 
crawford said the exception was allowed because the additives 
were primarily flavorings in meat and poultry products and did not 
make a significant nutritional contribution 
but he said the agencys paramount concern is public health 
and that it was found some people can have severe allergic 
reactions to those substances 
the agency is also concerned about a marked increase in the 
use of these ingredients during the last decade crawford said 
some manufacturers may be using the substances inappropriately as 
lowcost meat replacements 
now he said consumers with allergies to certain substances can 
tell if the product contains those ingredients 
crawford said meat and poultry processors will be allowed to 
make label changes over six months although the agency is working 
closely with the companies to speed it up 
at least one company is adding a stickon label to its regular 
packaging to further define the product ingredients he said

presidentelect violeta barrios de 
chamorro is insisting the sandinistas turn over everything 
including control of the army but the opposition appears to be 
backing down on its plan to denationalize the banks 
im the one who is going to give orders mrs chamorro said 
wednesday at her first news conference since she upset the leftist 
sandinistas in sundays elections 
mrs chamorro made it clear that gen humberto ortega president 
daniel ortegas brother would not be kept on as defense minister 
she did not say whether he would lose his rank or his second post 
as commander of the army 
they have to turn over everything she said adding that 
the minister of defense will be a civilian 
the leader of the victorious opposition coalition spoke as 
transition talks began between teams headed by humberto ortega and 
antonio lacayo mrs chamorros soninlaw and campaign manager 
control of the armed forces is a key issue for the transition 
teams to settle before mrs chamorro is inaugurated april 25 for a 
sixyear term 
it appeared her united national opposition uno had decided to 
give in on another key issue when a top aide said uno would accede 
to sandinista insistence on keeping the banking system under 
government control 
the banks will stay nationalized francisco mayorga an 
economic adviser to mrs chamorro said in an interview 
privatizing the banks had been one of unos campaign planks but 
on tuesday the sandinistas outlined a series of positions for 
transition negotiations that opposed that plan 
unos platform also calls for selling off many inefficient 
stateowned companies and freeing the economy from state 
restrictions moves the sandinistas oppose 
mayorga said he would travel to the united states seeking funds 
to help nicaragua climb out of an economic tailspin due in part to 
a us trade embargo that the bush administration now says it will 
lift nicaragua became one of the poorest nations in the western 
hemisphere during the 1980s 
negotiations over the military may be a more difficult problem 
with uno insisting on at least the appearance of control 
president ortega and his party have insisted army and security 
forces must maintain their strength and their political connection 
to the sandinista party especially while the usbacked contra 
rebels are still a threat 
both ortega and mrs chamorro have called on the contras to 
disband immediately but the contras have said they will not 
disband until mrs chamorro takes office 
the causes of civil war in nicaragua have disappeared she 
told the news conference by government count about 60000 people 
have been killed or wounded in the 9yearold war 
meanwhile ortega said he had ordered a halt in offensive 
military operations restoring a ceasefire that had ended nov 1 
ortega said the united states should help pay for demobilizing 
and resettling the 10000man contra army which is based in 
neighboring honduras 
us funding for the contras ran out wednesday although there 
are probably enough supplies in the pipeline to keep aid flowing at 
least a month or more 
the united states has provided only nonlethal aid to the 
contras since february 1988 
former president jimmy carter who had been serving as a 
mediator between the sandinistas and uno returned wednesday to the 
united states but other members of international observer teams 
remained behind 
former us attorney general elliot richardson dismissed uno 
complaints that the sandinistas were trying to rig the vote in the 
national assembly to prevent uno from getting the 60 percent it 
needs to make constitutional changes 
everything is normal he said 
current projections show uno getting 52 seats in the assembly to 
39 for the sandinistas including a seat for ortega as a losing 
presidential candidate who received more than 1 percent of the vote 
one other presidential loser moises hassan of the revolutionary 
unity movement was on the edge of 1 percent if he makes the cut 
the legislature will number 92 
the atmosphere in managua appeared to relax as it became clear 
the two sides were getting down to business but in the city of 
masaya about 3000 sandinistas held a threehour march wednesday 
night 
the demonstrators waving flags and wearing the redandblack 
neckerchiefs that symbolize the sandinista movement chanted 
traitors to the firing squad and they betrayed daniel as 
they marched through the streets 
masaya 18 miles southeast of managua is considered the cradle 
of the sandinista revolution that overthrew dictator anastasio 
somoza in 1979 
at least two people that the crowd suspected to be uno 
supporters were roughed up during the march but no serious 
injuries were reported

a senior agriculture department official said 
today that lowdose irradiation of meat and poultry could help 
reduce contamination of the us food supply by bacteria and other 
organisms 
the us government does not believe its role is to advocate 
food irradiation over other technologies said lester m 
crawford administrator of the departments food safety and 
inspection service 
however we do view it as a viable method for ensuring a safe 
and wholesome food supply and want to ensure that food processors 
have access to it 
crawfords remarks were in a speech prepared for delivery today 
at a conference in london a text was released here by the agency 
the food and drug administration is expected to approve 
irradiation for poultry products sometime in march said jim 
greene a spokesman for crawford 
no irradiated meat or poultry products are sold in the united 
states crawford said federal approval was granted in 1986 for the 
treatment of fresh or previously frozen pork to control trichinae 
microscopic parasites that can cause trichinosis if contaminated 
pork isnt cooked properly 
since that time no firm has expressed an interest in 
irradiating pork he said therefore further development of 
the usda regulations has been halted 
crawford said his agency filed a petition with fda in late 1986 
asking for approval of ionizing radiation on packaged fresh or 
frozen poultry to reduce some foodborne pathogens such as 
salmonella a common microorganism that can cause food poisoning 
we filed the petition because microbial reduction on raw 
products could have an important public health benefit and a 
technology with that potential deserves close attention and 
study he said

law enforcement officials including a 
prosecutor of ousted panamanian leader manuel noriega are hailing 
a supreme court ruling that bolsters us authority to conduct 
searches in foreign countries 
drug traffickers and terrorists will take no cheer from the 
courts opinion attorney general dick thornburgh said after 
wednesdays decision 
the ruling he said recognizes the right and need of law 
enforcement officers to have lawful practical means of dealing 
with international drug trafficking operations 
the court said us agents dont need warrants from american 
judges to search the homes of nonus citizens living abroad 
were happy to see it come said us attorney dexter 
lehtinen in miami whose office is prosecuting noriega its 
generally known that thats our position in the noriega case and 
its good news that the rules wont change 
noriega surrendered after us troops invaded panama in december 
in an effort to capture him noriega was brought to the united 
states to stand trial on drugtrafficking and moneylaundering 
charges 
there has been speculation noriegas lawyers might argue that 
us armed forces illegally seized evidence in the invasion 
noriega defense attorney steven kollin said wednesday before 
reading the court opinion that it apparently would not apply 
directly to noriegas arrest only material seized during searches 
in panama by us authorities 
the justices by a 63 vote upheld the warrantless search of 
the home of a suspected mexican drug smuggler 
but some civil libertarians said the ruling does not give us 
agents a free hand to raid the homes of foreigners living abroad 
opinions by some justices suggest there might be five votes to 
throw out evidence if agents act unreasonably said steven shapiro 
of the american civil liberties union 
its a mistake to read it as carte blanche for authorities to 
do whatever they want he said adding it the ruling is still 
disappointing 
our view is that when american agents seize evidence for use 
in an american trial in an american courtroom that can lead to 
imprisonment in an american jail their behavior should be subject 
to constitutional review shapiro said 
in other rulings wednesday the court 
gave police broad new authority to conduct sweeping searches in 
this country after making arrests in private homes voting 72 in a 
maryland case the justices said police may search a house when 
they have a reasonable suspicion there is a hidden danger to the 
arresting officers even if authorities lack a search warrant or 
probable cause to believe there is a danger 
said states may make the death penalty the only punishment for 
some murderers without violating the constitutions ban on 
mandatory death sentences the court by a 54 vote upheld a 
pennsylvania law 
in the drugsmuggling case chief justice william h rehnquist 
said constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and 
seizures does not apply to foreign property of aliens 
situations threatening to important american interests may 
arise halfway around the globe that require an american 
response with armed force he said if there are to be 
restrictions on searches and seizures which occur incident to such 
american action they must be imposed by the political branches 
through diplomatic understanding treaty or legislation 
justice william j brennan in a dissenting opinion said 
if we expect aliens to obey our laws aliens should be able to 
expect that we will obey our constitution when we investigate 
prosecute and punish them lawlessness breeds lawlessness 
the court ruled against suspected drug smuggler rene verdugo 
urquidez convicted in california in 1988 of taking part in the 
1985 kidnapping torture and murder of dea agent enrique camarena 
and his pilot 
the search warrant issue arose in a separate but related 
prosecution in which the dea searched his home in mexicali mexico 
in 1988 with cooperation of mexican authorities

the nations infant mortality rate may rise 
sharply if poor health trends arent reversed a national panel 
says 
the negative maternal and child health trends of the 1980s 
cast a shadow on our childrens future said former sen lawton 
chiles a florida democrat who is chairman of the bipartisan 
national commission to prevent infant mortality 
smoking drinking and drug use by pregnant women caused a 
significant part of the infant death problem the independent panel 
said in a report wednesday 
lives and money could be saved if greater access to prenatal and 
pediatric care were provided to pregnant women and young children 
the report said 
progress in reducing infant mortality has stalled chiles 
said in the 1990s we may see more infants die per year than the 
40000 we now lose before their first birthdays 
the report said progress in reducing the infant mortality rate 
slowed from 47 percent per year in the 1970s to 27 percent per 
year in the 1980s 
it also cited 
an increased number of highrisk pregnant women use of crack 
cocaine women with aids and syphilis and births to unmarried 
mothers all increased during the 1980s a 1988 survey found 11 
percent of pregnant women use illegal drugs 
an increase in the blackwhite infant mortality gap black 
infant mortality has been twice the white rate for years and 
recently the black rate has declined at a slower pace resulting in 
a widening of the gap 
low birthweight infants there was no improvement in the 1980s 
in the percentage of infants born under 55 pounds 
inadequate prenatal care the number of women obtaining late or 
no prenatal care increased between 1980 and 1987 the increase was 
17 percent for whites and 26 percent for blacks in 1987 more than 
74000 pregnant women received no prenatal care a 50 percent 
increase over the 1980 rate 
the commission cited figures showing the united states ranked 
20th among developed countries in the rate of infant mortality in 
1987

ny and when he unwrapped it he was shocked and chagrined to 
find a color tv set 
he said he sent it back immediately and nobody ever approached 
me in this manner again 
included in the transcripts was a letter to seife from robert 
shulman then president of bolar apologizing for an unfortunate 
incident that im sure embarrassed both of us shulman recently 
resigned as president and chief executive officer but remains on 
bolars board 
the letter explained i just meant to say thank you to someone 
i felt had shown us some understanding and compassion that he 
didnt have to 
eugene pfeifer a washington dc attorney representing bolar 
said he was aware of the incident but added we have no reason to 
believe it was a practice were not aware of anything else 
like that 
such a gift would be considered an illegal gratuity though the 
statute of limitations on prosecution has expired the transcripts 
have been turned over to the us attorney in baltimore for 
determination of whether it represents part of a pattern of 
conduct said a subcommittee source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
seife said two fda employees reported attempts to bribe them by 
a generic drug company consultant in one of the cases the man 
dropped an envelope with many thousand dollar bills on the desk 
of one of the agencys consumer safety officers in early february 
1988 
the safety officer harvey greenberg became quite dismayed 
and chased this fellow into the mens room and stuffed the envelope 
back in his pocket and reported the incident to seife the next 
day seife said 
greenberg has appeared before a federal grand jury in baltimore 
that has been investigating the generic drug scandal 
the scandal became public last spring the investigation also 
uncovered evidence that some drug companies had cheated on fda 
potency tests which prompted recalls of dozens of generic drugs 
including both generic versions of the widely prescribed high blood 
pressure drug dyazide 
bolar recalled its version of dyazide in january after the 
companys lawyers said documents supporting claims about the drug 
appeared to be falsified

the skeletal remains of indians belong with 
their tribes say panel members who spent a year trying to settle 
the controversy about who has the right to bones and burial objects 
held by museums 
i am told that at the outset the positions of tribal leaders 
and the museum community were worlds apart sen daniel inouye 
dhawaii chairman of the senate select committee on indian 
affairs said at a wednesday news conference announcing the panels 
findings 
the panel was appointed after anthropologists joined the 
american association of museums two years ago in opposing 
legislation that would have returned the remains and objects to 
tribes 
after a year of discussions the panel is proposing congress 
pass a law to assure that remains are handled properly the 
process inouye said would emphasize that respect for indian and 
native human rights is the paramount principle to govern 
repatriation claims 
under the process suggested by the panel tribal leaders would 
request the remains and burial artifacts they know to belong to 
their ancestors museums are expected to comply 
the panel also said museums should start inventories of indian 
remains and materials and begin talking to tribes about 
repatriation 
president bush signed a bill in november requiring the 
smithsonian institution to return the remains it holds to the 
proper tribes 
unfortunately the old policies of the rest of the federal 
government as well as nonfederal museums or similar institutions 
which receive federal funds are not affected by this law said 
panel member walter echohawk 
these agencies and institutions continue to remain free to 
withhold untold thousands of native dead from proper reburial by 
their tribes and peoples of origin 
sen john mccain rariz who oversaw the work of the panel 
said the report and recommendations would make it possible to 
proceed with legislation however a mccain aide said no bill had 
been written 
mccain said the group didnt reach full consensus on 
repatriation of remains and objects from tribes that no longer 
exist 
we will continue to try to resolve this issue he said

in a confirmation of timehonored ways a study 
today concludes that the oldfashioned stethoscope is just as good 
as electronic monitors and maybe even better for checking 
babies during birth 
the researchers found signs that cerebral palsy may be more 
common among infants whose births are electronically monitored 
possibly because the monitors led doctors to wait longer before 
acting to rescue a baby in distress 
but they cautioned that this finding could be a statistical 
fluke experts said moreover that monitors are likely to remain 
in use in part because they require less manpower in the delivery 
room 
electronic fetal monitors were introduced in the early 1970s and 
now are a fixture of delivery rooms everywhere still doctors have 
only recently begun rigorous testing to see if the machines help 
produce healthier babies 
its our view that although widely used electronic fetal 
monitoring during labor and delivery of highrisk infants appears 
to have no effect on childrens survival or neurological health 
said dr kirkwood k shy of the university of washington in seattle 
his study published in todays new england journal of medicine 
was performed at the university of washington hospital in seattle 
grace hospital in vancouver british columbia and madigan army 
hospital in tacoma wash 
the monitors are used to listen to the unborn babys heart the 
electronic blipblip of the fetal heartbeat is typically broadcast 
through the delivery room if abnormalities are heard doctors may 
choose to rescue the baby with a caesarean section or forceps 
dr benjamin sachs of bostons beth israel hospital called the 
latest findings very significant but added 
its unlikely that the fetal monitor will be abandoned we 
have an enormous investment in fetal monitoring equipment and a 
whole generation of physicians who have been trained in the 
technique 
in addition he said a monitor requires fewer nurses than the 
more laborious practice of regularly checking with stethoscopes so 
it is cheaper and more efficient 
shy notes that in part the successful use of stethoscopes 
results from two decades of experience with electronic monitors 
the two methods provide essentially the same information and the 
wide use of electronic monitors has taught doctors what warning 
signs they need to listen for with their stethoscopes 
the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists advises 
that mothers giving highrisk births have either continuous 
electronic monitoring or be checked with stethoscopes every 15 
minutes in the first stage of labor and every five minutes in the 
second stage 
the latest study was conducted on 93 children whose mothers had 
been randomly assigned to undergo electronic monitoring or checking 
with stethoscopes all their babies were premature and weighed less 
than four pounds 
tests of mental and physical development showed that the babies 
in both groups were about the same 18 months after birth but 20 
percent of the babies in the electronically monitored group had 
suffered cerebral palsy compared with 8 percent of those checked 
with stethoscopes 
cerebral palsy is partial loss of muscle control that can result 
from many causes including brain damage during birth whether the 
premature babies in the electronic monitoring group suffered this 
condition more often because of poor blood flow to the brain during 
birth is unclear 
however doctors were quicker to perform caesareans when they 
heard heartbeat abnormalities through their stethoscopes than on 
the electronic monitors on average electronically monitored 
babies in distress were delivered about 45 minutes later than were 
those checked with stethoscopes 
we can only conjecture why doctors waited longer with 
electronic monitoring shy said one explanation is that somehow 
the presence of information given from a machine was overly 
reassuring in the labor room 
he added that because only 23 children in the study had cerebral 
palsy we cant exclude the possibility that the result may have 
occurred on the basis of chance alone

seeking to soothe domestic and 
international critics chancellor helmut kohl says he recognizes 
polands desire for a legal guarantee that a united germany would 
not seek to return to its prewar borders 
however kohl on wednesday night reiterated his view that only 
the government of a reiunified germany could have final say about a 
possible treaty giving formal german recognition of the current 
border 
speaking in an interview with east german television wednesday 
night kohl seemed annoyed over worries even among his allies 
about his stance on the border issue 
in many speeches i have said that no one wants to connect the 
unity of the germans with moving the borders i dont know what 
more i can say kohl said 
kohl has come under sharp criticism abroad and at home for what 
is seen as an unclear position on lands east of the oder and neisse 
rivers once held by germany and now part of poland 
the land about onethird of presentday poland was awarded 
to poland after the defeat in 1945 of adolf hitlers third reich 
in an apparent effort not to alienate his most conservative 
constituents kohl has never formally stated that a united germany 
would not lay claim to that land and this is viewed as a major 
difficulty in the unification process 
poland the united states and britain among others have 
expressed concern over what they consider kohls lack of action 
kohl apparently seeking to ease the criticism told his cabinet 
wednesday he understands the polish wish for a legally binding 
recognition of polands western borders said government 
spokesman dieter vogel 
the chancellor also said he sees the possibility that after east 
germanys elections on march 18 the parliaments of both germanys 
could issue declarations on the matter said vogel 
vogel said such a declaration could confirm a resolution already 
passed by the west german parliament on nov 8 stating that germans 
neither now nor in the future will attempt to change the border 
kohl said only that the highest sovereign german power in the 
case of reunification could conclude such a treaty 
he also dismissed any fears of the rise of a fourth reich as 
rubbish the germans are completely immersed in international 
responsibility kohl said 
kohl has sought to allay the worries of poles whose country was 
devastated by the nazis but at the same time has insisted that 
only a united germany could take an official stand on the border 
issue 
the opposition social democrats have charged that with such 
pronouncements kohl is endangering international support for 
german unification 
hansjochen vogel head of the social democrats said wednesday 
that kohls statements about the border issue have been 
irresponsible and detrimental to german interests 
at the other end of the argument is west germanys 2 
millionstrong association of exiles which says it would take 
legal action if a united germany formally recognized polands 
western border 
in east germany the president of the governmentrun bank 
announced wednesday that it planned to switch to a westernstyle 
banking system with an autonomous central bank aiming for monetary 
stability by controlling the monetary supply 
such a move would make it more compatible with west germanys 
bundesbank and other western european central banks 
horst kaminskys comments were carried by adn the east german 
news agency 
since ousting hardline communist rulers last fall east germans 
have adopted economic reforms to encourage free enterprise and 
foreign investment and facilitate better integration with west 
germanys economy

the citys sweeping education reform effort is 
getting its first major test as principals learn whether theyre 
being rehired or fired by parents 
although the process is being declared a success at most 
schools teachers and students in the nations thirdlargest school 
system are protesting some firings and accusations of backroom 
deals and bigotry have surfaced 
these disruptions have raised doubts about the effectiveness of 
the councils that were elected in october as part of a package to 
improve chicagos troubled schools by putting more power in the 
hands of local communities 
under the 1988 reform law half the 540 community councils one 
for each of the 71 high schools and 469 elementary schools decide 
this year whether to terminate their principals fouryear 
contracts the 270 other councils vote on their principals next 
year 
about 10 percent of the principals under consideration are 
expected to lose their jobs said school board spokesman ken moses 
the councils have until april 15 to announce their decisions 
the school board said it has no figures on how many principals 
have been notified so far 
the reform law was passed because of the doubledigit dropout 
rate poor test scores violence and other ills that led william 
bennett then the federal education secretary to label chicagos 
school system as the nations worst in 1987 
the councils consist of six parents and five other members 
including teachers and the principal at each school in the 
410000student system 
the principals have no say on their own contracts which range 
from about 40000 to 70000 a year and fired principals have no 
recourse other than reconsideration by the councils said bob 
saigh another board spokesman 
david peterson principal at the wells high school for 13 years 
is among the principals fighting their dismissal notices 
many of the 1700 students at the mostly hispanic school staged 
a sitin tuesday to protest the firing announced the day before 
the faculty has written to superintendent ted kimbrough who has 
said he would intervene if it appeared councils acted improperly 
assistant principal miguel trujillo said peterson has the 
support of the community the student body the faculty and the 
staff 
the councils are using hidden agendas regardless of how 
the school community feels trujillo said 
peterson said the councils are being asked to act too quickly 
without enough information one council member said i was too 
strict another said i was too easy he said one said she was 
looking for a hispanic 
ive never felt that i had a divine right to be principal of 
anything peterson said but i dont believe that local 
councils were set up to turn schools into bastions of racism or 
ethnicity 
dan solis executive director of the united neighborhood 
organization a community group active in the reform effort said 
the racism charges were false its just presenting the bogeyman 
out there solis said 
allegations of discrimination also have surfaced at burns 
elementary school where council members said they voted not to 
renew principal donald krizs contract because he wouldnt 
cooperate with them 
they want him out because hes not hispanic and thats the 
bottom line said fifthgrade teacher lorraine stepanek who was 
among teachers picketing wednesday outside the school in a mostly 
hispanic district 
donald moore whose designs for change group helped shape the 
reform package said the protests are part of a process called 
democracy 
were talking about schools that are failing miserably across 
the city he said there is need for new leadership in many 
schools and its totally predictable that people at risk of 
losing their jobs are going to try to hang onto them 
the school board defends its decision to empower the councils 
this is the first year this has been done moses said 
whenever you have a new system somebodys not going to be 
pleased but if you can manage to satisfy the majority then i 
think you can call it a success

the newport daily news is fighting a 
lawsuit by a woman who wants to keep the paper from publishing her 
name once her divorce is final 
a lawyer for the woman identified only as jane doe said she is 
not a public figure and that a divorce notice would violate her 
right to privacy 
unfortunately divorce carries with it albeit for personal or 
religious reasons a social stigma said thomas w kelly she 
fears that the mere publication of her name intrudes on her life 
her husbands life and her future 
the suit filed tuesday is designed to force the news media 
to scrutinize the information and to prevent them from publishing 
information about marital breakdowns unless there is a reasonable 
element of newsworthiness 
the daily news for years has published monthly the names and 
addresses of people for whom final divorce decrees were entered in 
newport county family court 
editor david b offer said in a statement wednesday that 
publishing information about divorces which are on the public 
record for all to see is a normal and important practice for 
newspapers all over the country 
for very good reasons the right to provide this information 
to readers is protected by the first amendment he said 
the us supreme court has ruled that newspapers cannot be 
barred from publishing truthful information from open court 
records but kelly said the court signaled its willingness to allow 
exceptions with a ruling last june 
in that case the court said a rape victim could not recover 
damages against a paper that published her name in violation of a 
florida rape shield law 
but kelly said the court also stated that casebycase 
analysis of pressprivacy conflicts by the court is appropriate

the centers for disease control says 
foreigners who have aids or virtually any other contagious disease 
should be allowed into the country 
along with aids the cdc is recommending removing from the list 
all other contagious diseases except infectious tuberculosis a 
federal official said wednesday 
the cdc recommendation on aids is largely symbolic however 
because the list still would include infection with the human 
immunodeficiency virus or hiv which causes aids that restriction 
was imposed by congress 
the recommendation by the cdc to remove aids is seen as 
signaling congress that they should take hiv off the list as 
well said the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the immigration regulations concerning aids have been protested 
by aids activist groups including the national commission on aids 
and the world health organization 
several groups including the national association of people 
with aids have said they will boycott two major aids conferences 
in the united states this year unless the restrictions are changed

a private health group wants the food and drug 
administration to require stronger warnings on labels of oral 
contraceptives 
the public citizen health research group said wednesday that its 
review of 13 studies published since 1977 shows women under 45 who 
use birth control pills for many years may be at increased risk of 
developing breast cancer 
an fda advisory committee in january 1989 recommended no 
changes in use of the pill saying research on a possible link to 
breast cancer was inconclusive and more study was needed 
more than 13 million women in the united states between the ages 
of 15 and 44 use oral contraceptives 
fourteen studies published in the past decade found no link 
between the pill and breast cancer but few of these examined women 
who began using the pill at a young age and continued for many 
years the group said

the aftermath of sundays election has 
been surprisingly calm and a lot of that has been to president 
daniel ortegas credit 
the sandinistas agreed to the rules of the game and they 
havent changed their minds just because it didnt work out as 
expected 
if you have elections you run the risk of losing those 
elections ortega said wednesday speaking to members of 
international groups who support the sandinistas 
ortega was beaten in the vote by violeta barrios de chamorro in 
an upset that stunned his party which never imagined it could lose 
while the sandinistas have been adjusting psychologically to 
defeat and a life in the opposition mrs chamorros 14party 
coalition has been trying to make things as easy as possible 
we have to leave them alone we cant push them theyre tense 
and its dangerous to push them now said a senior strategist for 
her united national opposition uno 
uno has asked its supporters to go straight home after work and 
not to gloat in victory or even provide a target for an incident 
the victorious coalition had predicted widespread aggression and 
intimidation by sandinista militants something that has occurred 
in the past 
others thought the sandinistas with roots in marxist and 
leninist ideology would not give up state power under any 
conditions 
neither fear has been realized although there have been 
isolated incidents a drunken bottletossing clash an uno 
campaign headquarters occupied a murdersuicide between neighbors 
there has been no sign of a systematic effort to subvert the 
election results 
and both sides have begun to show a businesslike side as they 
begin difficult negotiations over the terms of a transfer of power 
the decisive contribution has come from ortega he commands 
loyalty and love from much of the party which remains the 
strongest and most cohesive political force in nicaragua 
if he concedes defeat theres nothing the others sandinista 
leaders can do its in his hands uno political strategist 
alfredo cesar said shortly before the voting 
with the army and security forces under close party control 
with arms distributed to labor unions agricultural cooperatives 
and other rankandfile groups the sandinistas could have tried to 
hold on by force 
but that was not the point ortega said wednesday 
the big question is this he said did the fsln 
sandinista front make the revolution to maintain itself as the 
only governing party in nicaragua or did the flsn make the 
revolution to open a democratic space that never before existed in 
this country 
although ortegas answer has been clear not all his supporters 
have agreed early in the week sandinista radio stations were 
flooded with calls from party members urging ortega to ignore the 
election results 
in his speeches since his defeat ortega has both recognized 
that passion and tried to calm the waters 
to these inflamed people who shout that they those who voted 
for uno sold themselves that they betrayed us i say that the 
people cant betray themselves but they can make a mistake 
ortega replied 
in six years when mrs chamorros term is up the worm will 
turn he said besides ortega noted the sandinistas remain the 
largest single party in the country and will be able to defend 
themselves in the national assembly 
the word went out after a meeting of 1500 party leaders from 
around the nation on wednesday the sandinista discipline asserted 
itself 
its bad for our morale bad for our morale said mario 
ramirez a member of a sandinista neighborhood committee the 
people were tricked the peasants the people daniel favored they 
were fooled 
but well do them in in six years he said 
on a practical level there remain tough and potentially 
inflammatory issues to negotiate before mrs chamorro takes office 
while uno wants control of the army the sandinistas dont want 
the army changed while ussupported contras still roam the hills 
but the two sides showed signs of working together when former 
president jimmy carter suggested that ortega and mrs chamorro call 
for immediate contra disbandment both did so within hours 
uno already appears to be pulling back from a platform plank 
calling for denationalization of the banks 
even the issue of army control may be subject to compromise 
mrs chamorro said a civilian would replace ortegas brother 
gen humberto ortega as defense minister but a knowledgeable 
source suggested the civilian might be a sandinista selected by uno

the list of major obstacles to a 
smooth transition of power from the sandinista party to the united 
national opposition alliance is short but deep 
military the sandinistas want the sandinista peoples army 
and the ministry of the interior left intact especially while the 
usbacked contras remain a force in being uno wants to trim 
them depoliticize them and change the armys name 
contras president daniel ortega has demanded immediate 
demobilization of the usbacked rebels and presidentelect 
violeta barrios de chamorro has agreed but the contras themselves 
say they will not dismantle until mrs chamorro is sworn in april 
25 
economy the sandinistas want the highly nationalized economic 
structure left intact uno has already agreed not to reprivatize 
the banks but their plan calls for decentralizing nicaraguas 
economy and selling off inefficient public enterprises something 
that may cost jobs anathema to the sandinistas 
confiscations the sandinistas want the lands houses and 
companies confiscated during their 10 years in power kept by the 
state or those to whom the properties were given uno will probably 
leave confiscated lands in present hands but wants to return 
companies to their private owners

a minnesota senate committee dealt a setback to a bill that 
would ban virtually all abortions while south carolinas governor 
signed a law requiring girls under 17 to get permission from a 
judge or parent to have an abortion 
gov carroll campbell said wednesday that the new law has to 
do with the family it has to do with government saying the family 
should be included in decisions and not excluded by government and 
i think thats important 
in minnesota a bill prohibiting abortions for birthcontrol 
reasons received a tie vote from the 16member senate health and 
human services committee bills need a majority vote to clear 
committee 
a bill is always alive as long as the session is on said 
sen gene waldorf the legislations senate sponsor 
the bill was drafted as model legislation by the national 
righttolife committee following last summers us supreme 
courts webster decision which gave states more leeway to restrict 
abortions 
witnesses on both sides said the legislation would be the 
toughest antiabortion measure in the nation prohibiting an 
estimated 93 percent of the abortions performed in the state a 
stronghold of antiabortion sentiment 
the new south carolina law says that beginning in june girls 
must have the permission of a judge parent or guardian to have an 
abortion incest victims are not subject to the law but rape 
victims are 
previously south carolina law required girls under 16 to obtain 
a parents consent for an abortion but similar laws without a 
socalled judicial consent option have been declared 
unconstitutional in other states

tent heavily damaged a sixstory sheraton hotel early today and 
authorities said 10 people were killed and about 70 injured 
guests some in pajamas or underwear jumped from upper floors 
of the luxury hotel or attached bedsheets to windowsills and 
slipped down to safety the newspaper alakhbar said 
police brig abdelrehim elkenawy said two of those killed were 
french nationals at least three americans were among those 
seriously injured a hospital official said 
the front of the modern 630room heliopolis sheraton hotel 
including lobbies restaurants and other facilities was destroyed 
and about a third of the hotel was blackened about 1000 guests 
and 300 employees were at the hotel when the fire broke out 
alakhbar reported 
there was no immediate word on the cause of the fire 
a hotel official said it had been receiving every few months 
anonymous threatening letters demanding that alcoholic drinks be 
banned and that the hotels nightclub be shut down 
such demands are customarily heard from extremist moslem 
fundamentalist groups but there were no indications so far linking 
them to the hotel fire 
fardos mohammed elsayed staying at the hotel with her husband 
a newly married son and his bride said the family had to leave 
their tworoom suite in bedclothes 
we were going to sleep when suddenly we heard foreigners 
shouting in english fire fire and we heard people running in 
corridors said mrs elsayed we went down thinking it was a 
small thing and left everything behind 
with more than 30 fire units on the scene including some from 
the army the fire still burned eight hours after it broke out at 
about 1 am 
helmeted riot police carrying shields ringed the hotel as 
firefighters and rescue teams worked 
victor lewis assistant manager of the cairo sheraton flagship 
of the chains six hotels in egypt said the blaze began in the 
nubian tent a restaurant where tourists watch bellydancing and 
other traditional egyptian amusements 
the restaurant is in a tent adjacent the hotels outer wall 
winds quickly spread the fire 
one problem was that some guests opened their windows to see 
what was going on lewis said as a result sparks went into 
their rooms driven by the strong winds which spread the fire 
into the building 
the injured were taken to nearby heliopolis hospital and the 
palestine red crescent hospital 
dr samiri sultan director of the heliopolis hospital said he 
received seven dead and 31 injured sultan said six of the 17 badly 
injured were from france three each from the united states

mexicanlebanese citizenship 
at the palestinian red crescent hospital dr hassan kamil said 
nine people including two canadians and a dane had been admitted 
with bone fractures smoke inhalation and bruises 
a spokesman from egypts emergency medical services said about 
70 people were injured sheraton officials said some slightly 
injured guests did not go to hospitals but received firstaid 
treatment after being transferred to other hotels

meanwhile despite central bank intervention the dollar rose by 
126 yen closing at 14978 yen its highest close since 15130 yen 
last june 15 despite a pause in its climb on wednesday it has 
gained 526 yen since feb 19 the dollar opened today at 14935 
and ranged between 14935 yen and 14990 yen 
on the stock exchange the largest concern among market 
players is the foreign exchange situation yoshiro inoue of 
nomura securities co said 
the weak yen makes japanese shares less attractive and also 
affects the bond market another influence on the stock exchange 
ichitaro watanabe a dealer with nikko securities co said 
there was substantial selling by those eager to unload holdings 
that depreciated badly during the stock market debacle in the past 
week 
computeraided selling by arbitrageurs accelerated the 
decline he added 
but he said a market crash was highly unlikely because the 
recent decline has not been caused by panic selling 
in arbitrage dealing traders aided by computers spot price gaps 
between different markets for example the spot and futures markets 
and seek to profit from them 
arbitrageurs today sold shares in the spot market to take 
advantage of a fall in the nikkei futures index dealers said 
the nikkei index for the spot market fell 156910 points on 
monday in its secondlargest oneday plunge ever and its worst 
since the october 1987 global crash but it bounced back with gains

foreign and domestic securities not to file arbitrage selling 
orders after trading sessions begin if the indicator is falling 
in the currency market dealers said the dollars sharply higher 
opening in tokyo thursday followed its overnight surge on overseas 
markets 
in new york the dollar rose to 14908 yen up from 14873 late 
tuesday as traders sold the west german mark for the dollar the 
dollars strength carried over into dollaryen trading 
the general perception in the market is that there wont be an 
interest rate hike in west germany for some time and that 
encouraged the mark selling in new york said a dealer with 
daiichi kangyo bank speaking on condition of anonymity 
a trader with the bank of tokyo also requesting anonymity said 
the dollars climb is expected to continue for some time as market 
players see how high they can push it 
the bank of japan the nations central bank has been 
intervening in the market intermittently selling dollars in an 
attempt to support the yen the bank does not comment on its 
specific exchange market activities 
a bank of japan official said however the bank will continue 
to intervene in the market for the time being but we will 
consider other measures as deemed necessary to check the yens 
decline kyodo news service reported

the governments case against manuel noriega has 
been reinforced by the us supreme courts decision granting 
agents broader authority to conduct searches in foreign countries 
the lead prosecutor says 
were happy to see it come us attorney dexter lehtinen 
said of the ruling wednesday that us authorities do not need a 
warrant to search a foreign site in a case involving a nonus 
citizen its generally known that thats our position in the 
noriega case and its good news that the rules wont change 
noriega contends his arrest after the dec 20 american invasion 
was illegal as was the us seizure of evidence from homes and 
offices the ousted panamanian dictator is accused of taking 
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade 
one of noriegas attorneys steven kollin said that he had not 
read the opinion but that the ruling apparently wouldnt apply 
directly to noriegas arrest he said it might relate to material 
seized by us authorities 
yet samuel burstyn attorney for noriega codefendant luis del 
cid said the ruling also could encompass the issue of illegal 
arrest 
this is a blow to that defense he said 
burstyn also said the case seemed to undermine in part 
previous supreme court rulings that authorities could not benefit 
from illegal searches or arrests 
the judge should punish the prosecution for doing something 
illegal but now they are refusing to do so the attorney said 
the supreme court decision helps in joint overseas operations 
because us agents will now be bound by the same law used in the 
host country lehtinen said 
we think its important that you dont have a double set of 
rules lehtinen said what a contrary opinion would do is to 
say their own law is not good enough for their own country

about 3 million ethiopians could die of hunger 
this year because government and rebel forces refuse to stop 
fighting long enough to allow delivery of food shipments state 
department officials say 
the officials briefed two house subcommittees wednesday about 
efforts to arrange a ceasefire and coordinate food shipments to 
starving residents of northern ethiopia 
assistant secretary of state herman cohen said the united states 
had been holding highlevel talks with the soviet union which arms 
the ethiopian government on the increasingly dire situation 
the soviet supplies which last year amounted to 600 million 
are on a downward curve he said as the kremlin extricates 
itself from financial support of third world governments and 
channels resources to domestic needs 
the soviets have pulled half of their 2000 military advisers 
out of ethiopia and have urged the government of mengistu haile 
mariam to discuss peace with the two main insurgent groups in the 
provinces of tigre and eritrea he said 
but there has been no progress in the effort to get talks going 
under the mediation of former president jimmy carter cohen said 
the united states he said has not been impressed by the 
commitment of either side in ethiopia to peace and relief efforts 
the ethiopian government must offer concrete proposals for a 
loose federation of states that would keep the country whole yet 
preserve the character of eritrea and tigre he said 
the eritrean peoples liberation front must accept some 
measure of responsibility for the increased risk of famine and mass 
starvation because of the offensive it launched feb 8 that cut 
off food supplies through the port of massawa cohen told the 
committees 
there are unconfirmed reports that about 45000 tons of us 
food were destroyed in the offensive and subsequent government 
bombing of the town said andrew natsios director of the state 
departments office of foreign disaster assistance 
perhaps as many as 3 million people are now trapped by the 
fighting with no access to relief food he said adding that 
unless the fighting stops a catastrophe of terrible proportions 
will be visited upon the ethiopian people again comparable to 
198485 when 1 million people died 
he said hundreds of thousands could die if no food reaches them 
within three or four weeks 
cohen said support from foreign governments such as the soviets 
and israel must stop 
we have been very staunch in our opposition to any arms 
supplies whether from the soviet union israel or any other 
country cohen said 
israel which recently reestablished diplomatic ties with 
ethiopia has assured the united states its supplies to mengistu 
are minimal consisting of small arms and trainers cohen said 
israeli officials have denied reports that they are providing 
mengistu with cluster bombs but concede they are helping the 
government because they want mengistu to allow more than 20000 
jews to leave the country 
mengistu has been seeking to replace the declining soviet 
deliveries with weapons from north korea china and brazil said 
cohen but so far has not been successful 
the united states is looking to the united nations to be more 
active in organizing international relief supplies to ethiopia 
including using airlifts and ensuring the sides hold their fire to 
allow deliveries of food he said

the big readytowear winter fashion shows dont 
begin until midmarch but a new japanese designer named jun inoue 
jumped the gun with a lowkey collection of coordinates 
his adorable trapeze minicoats wellcut buttoned jodhpur 
pants beautiful fabrics and excellent cuts displayed wednesday 
would be good news in any collection for next winter 
jun inoue working under the name jun july auguste is 
just the latest japanese designer trying to make it in paris 
kenzo came into his own over 18 years ago hanae mori turned 
into a french couturiere about 20 years ago issey miyake has 
shown in paris for years and rei kawakubo stunned her audiences 
with clothes shot full of holes for comme des garcons more than 
a decade ago 
opting for a quiet show in the cellar of his small boutique near 
the louvre that will open officially next summer jun was modest 
but hopeful for a big future in paris and all over the world 
paris is the place to be said jun 37 ive lived here 15 
years and get my inspiration here 
i thought he did a wonderful job said jeanpaul gaultier 
for whom jun worked eight years the wayout wonder boy of french 
fashion gaultier said he liked the details like a shirred 
minidress in soft fabrics worn over a silky turtleneck undershirt 
inoues small collection was smart and young in every way he 
led off with wellcut black cuffed shorts worn with a highwaisted 
long jacket nipped in by a drawstring with a high waistline the 
outfit topped with a jaunty sailors beret 
the high waistline often buckled at the side was a kind of 
signature for juns leggy look that was always paired with matching 
or contrasting opaque tights exclusive productions for jun and 
little flat suede oxords 
while the gamine mini look was young there was a lot for women 
of all ages who want a bit of originality in their closets the 
softly belted trench coats the checked pants suits with narrow 
jodhpurstyle trousers buttoned up from the ankle could be worn by 
almost anyone 
details can make or break a collection and jun found some 
excellent touches his motherofpearl buttons with a dangling 
pearl to doll up dark blazers and coats are not seen anywhere else 
one dress sure to make a hit was a camisole sliplike mini 
number with a heavy eyelet embroidered decor on the top and hem 
worn with a slinky tshirt top and contrasting tights the same 
eyelet detail on collars pepped up shortie coats with their flared 
skirts 
the fabrics were soft but warm for winter the color 
combinations autumnal and artistic besides navy and black there 
were touches of dusty rose or blue ochre khaki and aubergine or 
burgundy often worked together in appealing combinations 
one of the real originals in the collection was a brown 
velveteen dress shirred around the scoop neckline and at the waist 
worn with a silky highnecked green shirt underneath 
for dressier moments jun also used chiffon to fashion flyaway 
minis over matching tights beautiful in deep blue and ochre other 
ideas included his strict black tuxedo with narrow chino pants the 
jacket lapels made of a ribbon effect over a polkadotted blouse 
whether working with taffeta or elasticized wool jersey jun 
seemed right at home with his fabrics showing exquisite tailoring 
and cut 
jun july auguste has japanese backing by the five fox 
retail group and they hope to do well in france before starting 
marketing in the united states 
the clothes will be manufactured for the french market by 
choffletstyle in moulins in central france who also make clothes 
for wellknown names like paco rabanne azzedine alaia and popy 
moreni 
priced around 475 to 700 for a long jacket or coat the 
clothes may sound expensive but by highquality luxury 
readytowear standards these days theyre almost a steal for 
anybody who wants original touches in a fashionable wardrobe

leave polling places each election day providing its findings on 
local state and national races to the networks and other media it 
also will project winners based in part on the exit polls 
competitive pressures at times have led networks to project 
winners in presidential races before polls closed in the west 
prompting complaints from voters there sharing projections is 
intended to lessen those pressures 
costcutting spurred discussion of the consortium the four 
founders are to pay 3 million apiece for exit polls through the 
1992 elections saving each network at least 9 million 
critics of joint polling are concerned it will provide less 
information than competing polls which sometimes raise different 
subjects and phrase questions differently and because individual 
polls can be wrong competing surveys serve as a check on polling 
accuracy they said 
i have mixed emotions said harry oneill vice chairman of 
the roper organization polling concern and president of the 
national council on public polls competition keeps everybody on 
their toes that would be lacking 
all polls are subject to measurement error said andrew 
kohut former president of the gallup organization now with 
princeton survey research associates when there are more 
attempts at measuring something you get a better sense of what the 
dynamics of the issue are 
however oneill said a single poll done very well could be more 
valuable than separate ones conducted haphazardly and other 
polling experts said the joint poll could create a standard for 
comparing voting trends 
joseph angotti a senior vice president for news at nbc said 
each partner in the shared exit poll would ask essentially the same 
questions they would have asked in their own surveys so no less 
information would result 
on polls serving as a check on one another he said it 
boggles my mind to think that there are people who feel that two 
conflicting polls or three conflicting polls is somehow better 
for the republic than one poll 
participants will continue to conduct other polls individually 
including preelection polls on voter sentiment and general public 
opinion surveys 
warren mitofsky director of the election and surveys unit of 
cbs news will direct voter research and surveys reporting to a 
board of directors named by the four network partners 
network executives said they did not expect the us justice 
department to object to the consortium on grounds it would unfairly 
limit competition because they said any other news organization 
can subscribe

nearly 7000 hospital patients died because of 
medical negligence in new york state in 1984 but only 26 doctors 
were disciplined according to a harvard university study 
the results of the survey released wednesday were seized upon by 
both sides of the debate over a proposal to provide nofault 
malpractice insurance 
although the survey involved only new york state and was 
commissioned by the legislature for its review of malpractice 
reform researchers said they expect a nationwide survey would find 
similar results 
opponents of the nofault policy which has been proposed by dr 
david axelrod the state health commissioner said the figures show 
the prevalence of malpractice and the need for doctors to be held 
accountable for their misdeeds 
how can this be no ones fault asked elaine orourke 
pointing to her son who went into a hospital for a bedwetting 
problem and came out braindamaged and in a wheelchair she 
attended a news conference at which the findings were released 
axelrod said the surveys finding that only 2 percent of 
patients injured because of negligence filed malpractice lawsuits 
showed the faults in the system a nofault system compensate 
victims without a judicial finding of negligence making it easier 
for victims to receive compensation 
a spokesman for the medical society of the state of new york 
which supports axelrods call for reform said the current system 
is a grotesque failure 
it overcompensates some but tragically it fails to compensate 
many many people who are the victims of inadequate medical care 
gerard l conway said at the news conference 
nofault proponents believe it would protect doctors from the 
increasing insurance premiums that are driving many specialists 
from their fields especially obstetrics 
axelrod said he believed nofault insurance also would lessen 
doctors fears that reporting negligence by colleagues would bring 
lawsuits upon themselves or their hospital 
doctors and hospitals are required by state law to report all 
cases of possible medical misconduct however the state received 
only 1525 reports of possible misconduct in 1984 and only 161 
came from physicians or hospitals said peter slocum a health 
department spokesman 
the fouryear study reviewed the records of more than 30000 
patients from 51 randomly selected hospitals in new york state the 
researchers found that 1 percent of all hospital patients in the 
state were treated negligently 
it projected a total of 13000 hospitalcaused injuries that led 
to deaths and said slightly more than half of the fatal injuries 
were due to negligence 
the study noted that many of the deaths occurred in patients 
who had greatly shortened life expectancies from their underlying 
diseases 
the researchers stressed the findings could not be applied to 
hospitals today since most have taken steps since 1984 to improve 
patient care

in a statement likely to intensify the flight 
from hong kong china indicated today that it may not recognize 
foreign passports held by hong kong chinese after britain returns 
the colony in 1997 
the statement read by foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing 
said any chinese citizen seeking foreign citizenship must first get 
chinese permission to forfeit his chinese citizenship 
china regards hong kong as part of china even before 1997 and 
considers ethnic chinese living there to be chinese citizens the 
statement did not indicate the possibility of dual citizenship 
li also said china reserves the right to take appropriate 
measures in response to britains decision last year to issue 
british passports to 225000 of the 58 million hong kong residents 
li called britains action a unilateral decision to 
change the citizenship of some hong kong residents and urged 
britain to refrain from this wrong practice 
britains action was intended to stem emigration from hong kong 
by guaranteeing key civil servants the safety of british consular 
protection after 1997 however lis statement seemed to indicate 
that china reserves the right to nullify those passports 
the effect would be to encourage the holders to emigrate to 
britain china may be betting that britain will take back its 
passport offer now rather than risk a massive influx of hong kong 
residents 
a british newspaper the daily mail said today that britain had 
won promises from seven other european and asian countries to 
follow its example and offer passports to thousands of hong kong 
residents as a confidenceboosting measure 
fear of living under communist rule has caused an estimated 
1000 hong kong residents to emigrate each week many of the 
colonys ethnic chinese residents fled there to escape communist 
rule on the mainland 
fears compounded after june when the chinese army crushed 
prodemocracy protests in mainland cities china refused to 
guarantee it would not take similar action in hong kong and 
reserved the right to crush any subversive activities there 
after 1997 
li refused to explain his statement telling reporters to read 
it and figure it out themselves 
it takes serious attention to get a proper understanding of 
this question and note it down he said sarcastically in response 
to questions i can repeat my answer and tell my interpreter to 
go even slower 
he then reread the sevensentence statement stopping midway to 
admonish his interpreter to speak more slowly for the benefit of 
my friends 
the british embassy in beijing said no officials were available 
today to comment 
in january a chinese official involved in drafting hong kongs 
post1997 law lu ping said ethnic chinese in hong kong with 
british passports would not be treated as british citizens at that 
time british foreign secretary douglas hurd insisted the official 
was wrong 
lis new statement however appeared to confirm lus comment 
at present ethnic chinese in hong kong hold passports as 
british dependent territory citizens which do not grant 
british citizenship or the right to live in britain 
the 225000 passports britain plans to issue hong kong chinese 
would provide for full citizenship with the right to live in 
britain it made the offer in the belief that few chinese would 
actually move to britain where there is strong popular resistance 
to nonwhite immigration 
in hong kong the territorys lawmaking body today approved a 
motion expressing disappointment that chinas draft constitution 
for hong kong does not include a more democratic political system 
the legislative council overwhelmingly rejected a motion 
deploring a chineseappointed committees proposed constitution as 
an extremely undemocratic political model supporters of the 
defeated motion said greater democracy was needed to stem 
emigration 
under the constitution onethird of the seats in the council 
will be decided by direct election in 1997 rising to onehalf by 
2003 the remaining seats will be chosen by interest groups and an 
electoral college

nelson mandela held his first formal talks 
today with exiled leaders of the african national congress and a 
top military official expressed a willingness to meet with rival 
south african military commanders 
the talks could bring some indication of whether the black 
nationalist leader released by south africas whiteled government 
last month after 27 years in prison will be given a formal role or 
enhanced position in the anc 
chris hani the second in command of the ancs military wing 
told reporters that preliminary talks with president fw de 
klerks government might include contact with the south african 
military 
after mandela was freed on feb 11 the anc promised to send a 
delegation to south africa for such talks though a date has not yet 
been set 
guerrilla leaders believe any talks could not be limited to 
political leaders alone and hani said he envisioned a time when 
military officers from both sides would meet to work out the 
modalities of a ceasefire 
hani and joe modise the top commander of the anc military wing 
umkonte we sizwe spear of the nation were among 32 exiled 
leaders belonging to the 35member national executive committee who 
began formal discussions with mandela in lusaka 
the national executive meeting chaired by acting president 
alfred nzo began with an emotional ceremony in which mandela 
raised a clenched first salute joined in the singing of the 
nationalist anthem nkosi sikelele afrika or god save africa in 
mandelas native xhosa language 
mandela 71 was flanked by nzo and joe slovo a ranking white 
anc official who is also the secretarygeneral of the south africa 
communist party 
hani said the first business meeting with mandela since he 
arrived in zambia on tuesday to visit anc headquarters would focus 
on a broad agenda of issues including mandelas role in the 
organization 
already he has brought a new dimension to our struggle i am 
sure the national executive will be more precise about the sort of 
role he is going to play hani said 
since his release mandela has been given no formal position in 
the anc 
the presence of mandela in our midst is a tonic it 
strengthens all of us we feel we are really moving forward he is 
a great leader hani said we are sure the anc will move from 
strength to strength with mandela as one of the comrades at the 
helm of things 
no specific agenda was released for the twoday meeting at 
lusakas mulungushi hall but hani said conferees including former 
longtime political detainee walter sisulu 77 and other anc 
officials from south africa would discuss the lifting of a 30year 
ban on the anc that de klerk announced feb 2 
amid calls from church leaders in south africa and president 
kenneth kaunda of zambia for the anc to suspend its guerrilla 
actions hani said the organizations leaders would discuss what 
is happening in the armed struggle and a clear strategy on that 
we will be looking at how to take forward the process of 
negotiation 
the executive meeting is expected to select at least 10 names of 
delegates it wants to hold preliminary talks with de klerk to clear 
obstacles in the way of fullscale negotiations on writing a new 
constitution that gives south africas 28 million black majority 
political rights 
the anc is demanding the lifting of the state of emergency in 
force since june 1986 and the the release of all political 
prisoners including those convicted of acts of violence

military officials and the chairman of the 
senate armed services committee are expressing concerns about the 
bush administrations agreement to cut american and soviet forces 
in europe 
the white house moved to reaffirm its support for the troop cut 
plan announced by secretary of state james a baker iii last month 
in ottawa and denied one military officials statement that the 
agreement is still being reviewed within the administration 
the plan to cut troop levels which must be ratified by the 
senate would allow the united states to deploy 195000 troops in 
the central european zone and 30000 troops elsewhere in europe 
i believe we are very seriously inhibiting our future 
flexibility sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services 
panel said at a hearing wednesday 
air force secretary donald rice said there were also concerns 
within the military telling nunn he understood military commanders 
would prefer to see and i think all of us would prefer to see 
the agreement modified he said it was being reviewed by 
administration officials 
gen larry d welch the air force chief of staff said the 
united should get an exemption to the agreement allowing for 
reinforcements beyond the 30000 level in case of an emergency 
white house officials said later wednesday that modifications to 
the agreement are not under consideration and the agreement baker 
negotiated with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze is not 
being reviewed 
meanwhile nunn attacked president bush for failing to exclude 
military personnel from required budget cuts and then calling on 
congress to help him avert massive layoffs 
nunn said at the hearing that the administration played games 
with the budget indicating last year that it could handle the 
reductions but then requesting a shift in funds to avoid dismissing 
tens of thousands of military personnel 
the administration is the one who clearly laid the bed of 
thorns and is now pointing the finger at congress saying help us 
to get out of this situation nunn told reporters 
nunn and sen john warner of virginia the panels ranking 
republican said they favor granting the defense department the 
authority to move 852 million from other accounts to personnel to 
avoid the layoffs 
but rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said his committee would not take up the issue of 
shifting the funds thus dooming the pentagons request 
such reprogramming of funds must be approved by the house 
and senate armed services committees and the house and senate 
appropriations committees 
at wednesdays hearing nunn questioned the service chiefs about 
why bush did not exempt military personnel from the cuts an option 
that the president could have exercised in august under the law 
the defense department evidently did not come down strong on 
exempting personnel if they did they failed within the 
administration nunn said during the committee hearing now 
everybody in the administration is pointing at congress saying 
save us from what weve done and its your fault if you dont 
save us from what we didnt do 
thats a curious position to be in he said 
adm carlisle ah trost chief of naval operations said all 
the service chiefs argued for exempting military personnel but were 
assured by administration officials that any cuts from grammrudman 
would be softened by a request to shift funds 
nunn said the administration shouldnt have given those 
assurances based on the belief that officials could later persuade 
four congressional committees to accept the transfer of funds 
somebody should have checked with the four committees because 
obviously the house wasnt plugged into that nunn said 
he said he hoped the fund transfer could occur but aspin in an 
interview later in the day said the chances of his changing his 
mind were zero 
youll see a lot of wheeling and dealing but its not going 
to work aspin said in an interview with several reporters

south africa has extensive 
trade and aid ties with nearly every black african nation despite 
efforts to isolate pretoria according to a report today 
business day newspaper said that rusty evans deputy director 
general of the ministry of foreign affairs told a meeting earlier 
this week that south africa trades with all members of the 
organization of african unity the main grouping of african states 
evans told the institute of international affairs trade was worth 
several billion dollars 
the report cited other officials as saying the value of south 
african trade to black african nations was worth about 2 billion 
dollars a year 
many black african nations have bans on political economic and 
other ties with south africa to protest the policies of the 
whiteminority government but south african officials have said in 
recent months that many black nations are ignoring the bans and 
trading with pretoria 
evans said south africa is also administering scores of aid 
projects in many black african nations including agricultural 
medical and educational programs the report said 
he said south africa wanted to improve relations with 
neighboring black nations and the opportunity had been created by 
reduction in western european aid to africa the report said 
many western european nations were diverting aid to east europe 
and black african nations needed south african aid to compensate

the earthquake that shook up southern 
california was the latest reminder that the state straddles two 
gigantic plates of earths constantly moving crust 
the shaking most people felt was minor as opposed to what we 
know can happen paul flores of the california office of 
emergency services said of wednesdays quake therefore people 
need to take the necessary precautions to prepare in reducing 
hazards at home and in the workplace 
california sits on the boundary between the pacific and north 
american plates which move about two inches per year in relation 
to each other said kate hutton a seismologist at the california 
institute of technology 
that motion causes strain or deformation to happen in the 
crust when something snaps under that strain its an 
earthquake she said 
wednesdays earthquake considered moderate with a magnitude of 
55 on the richter scale was felt from san diego to santa barbara 
it caused scattered structural damage but no serious injuries were 
reported 
sixteen aftershocks strong enough to be felt occurred within 2 
hours of the 343 pm main shock a 48 aftershock struck at 724 
pm 
the pacific plate underlies the pacific ocean and much of 
southern california it is slowly grinding northwest past the north 
american plate which underlies the rest of the continent 
the 600mile san andreas fault generally is considered the 
boundary between the two plates but the plate motion also triggers 
earthquakes on a complicated series of faults riddling california 
the movement of the pacific plate creates many parallel faults 
that run northwest to southeast and include the san andreas the 
san jacinto and a series of offshore faults 
others including the unnamed fault that caused wednesdays 
quake run perpendicular to the plate motion from northeast to 
southwest those faults also are created by plate movements 
both types of faults are known as strikeslip faults in which 
ground on one side of a fault moves horizontally past ground on the 
other side 
californias seismic map is further complicated by the fact that 
as the pacific plate slides past the north american plate it also 
presses against it 
that compression can cause thrust faults where ground on one 
side of a fault moves vertically with respect to ground on the 
other side 
thrust fault motion has caused several destructive earthquakes 
in california in recent years including the 1987 whittier narrows 
quake east of los angeles the 1983 coalinga earthquake in the san 
joaquin valley and the 1971 san fernando earthquake that killed at 
least 58 people in the los angeles area 
wednesdays strikeslip jolt occurred three miles northwest of 
upland at the base of the san gabriel mountains which were created 
by compressive thrust motion it was centered at least 15 miles 
from any major faults said the us geological survey

former cia agent frank w snepp iii must 
get permission from the agency before publishing a manuscript about 
his experiences in vietnam a federal appeals court ruled 
a threejudge panel of the 4th us circuit court of appeals on 
wednesday affirmed a ruling by us district judge james c 
cacheris of alexandria 
snepp a cia agent in vietnam for eight years resigned from the 
agency and in 1977 published a book about his experiences called 
decent interval 
the government sued snepp for violating an employment agreement 
to submit all writings in advance to the cia and the us supreme 
court ruled in favor of the agency in 1980 
snepp and the cia subsequently have agreed on publication of 18 
of his manuscripts the latest lawsuit arose out of a disagreement 
over snepps plans to write a script for a television miniseries on 
his experiences in vietnam 
after prolonged negotiations the cia approved the script but 
the television deal had fallen through snepp sued to place the 
burden on the cia to initiate judicial proceedings if he and the 
agency could not agree on a manuscript 
the appeals panel held that condition would alter the 1980 
supreme court ruling 
the three members of the appeals panel were fourth circuit 
judges j dickson phillips jr and francis d murnaghan jr and 
us district judge joseph young of baltimore who was assigned to 
the appeals case in a routine move to help the circuit court deal

fires blazed out of control and shells 
exploded in east beirut today as renegade gen michel aouns troops 
tried to break through the lines of a rival christian militia 
police said 14 people were killed 
police reported savage street battles on the north and 
northeastern edges of the militiaheld residential districts of 
ashrafiyeh and nabaa 
the command of samir geageas lebanese forces militia said in a 
communique that it repulsed several attempts by aouns m48 tanks 
to smash its defenses 
a police spokesman said aouns tanks advancing behind a curtain 
of heavy howitzer shelling made little progress on the edge of 
nabaa where the terrain is flat but could not penetrate the 
militias defenses on the slopes of ashrafiyeh the spokesman who 
cannot be named in line with regulations said aouns advance in 
nabaa was very costly the army has many casualties including an 
officer but we dont have details 
he said at least 14 people were killed and 50 wounded in the 
days battles 
by police count the showdown for mastery of the 310squaremile 
christian enclave has killed 708 people and wounded 1984 since it 
began jan 30 
the confrontation the fiercest among christians in the nearly 
15yearold civil war also has inflicted property damage estimated 
at 750 million 
aouns attack shattered a relative 12day lull in the christian 
enclave since feb 17 when a christian mediation committee called 
a ceasefire 
on wednesday christian religious leaders called for a full 
ceasefire and the withdrawal of rival forces from the streets of 
the christian enclave before a political dialogue between aoun and 
geagea 
the attack by aouns troops is the generals way of saying no 
to the renewal of efforts by the mediation committee to stabilize 
the ceasefire said a christian source close to the mediation 
committee the source refused to be further identified 
the progeagea voice of lebanon radio station said its 12story 
building in ashrafiyeh took several direct hits in aouns howitzer 
shelling of the district however no casualties were reported 
among its staff who continued to operate from shellproofed 
basement studios 
the police spokesman said aouns gunners were pounding 
ashrafiyeh and nabaa from 130mm sovietmade howitzers at the rate 
of 20 shells a minute 
at least a half dozen fires were blazing out of control in 
ashrafiyeh and nabaa because of the fierce shelling fire engines 
could not leave their basement garages to combat the blazes the 
spokesman said 
aouns 19000strong army controls the southeastern sector of 
east beirut the eastern suburbs of baabda hazmiyeh and fayadiyeh 
as well as the northwestern metn mountains 
geageas 6000member militia controls twothirds of the 
christian enclave including the two isolated pockets in east 
beirut as well as kesrouan and byblos provinces north of the city 
and part of batroun province which borders syrian lines in north 
lebanon 
geageas militia controls maritime supply lines linking its 
beirut war council headquarters with the port of jounieh 
provincial capital of kesrouan 
the military source said aoun chose a rainy and stormy day to 
launch his new offensive in an apparent effort to benefit from

britain during the cold war and who spent 18 months in a moscow 
prison after being caught has died of throat cancer hospital 
officials said today he was 71 
wynne died at londons cromwell hospital on wednesday the 
british domestic news agency press association reported quoting 
unidentified close friends 
hospital spokesman tony prescott said he was admitted with a 
wellknown preexisting condition he would not elaborate 
the wealthy businessman who described his exploits in two 
celebrated memoirs the man from moscow and the man from 
odessa worked for britains mi6 secret intelligence service he 
said he acted as the intermediary for soviet double agent col oleg 
penkovsky a senior military intelligence officer who passed moscow 
secrets to mi6 and the cia 
opposition labor party legislator ted leadbitter said of wynne 
in a statement to reporters wednesday night how many secrets has 
this man taken to his grave 
wynne set up his own business as an exporter of industrial 
engineering products in 1950 it involved a lot of foreign travel 
including trips to soviet bloc countries and thus provided ideal 
cover for spying 
he was arrested during a business trip to budapest hungary in 
november 1962 and taken to the soviet union he was put on trial in 
moscow on may 1963 for spying and sentenced to eight years 
imprisonment 
penkovsky who was tried with him was sentenced to death for 
treason but he reportedly committed suicide in a soviet labor camp 
wynne served 18 months in moscows lubyanka prison however he 
was freed in 1964 in exchange for soviet spy conon molody or 
gordon lonsdale as he called himself in britain 
after his release wynne revealed details about his espionage 
career british officials have never officially commented on his 
accounts 
he said he first joined the british security services in 1938 
and worked for them during world war ii he began working for mi6 
in 1960 making contact with penkovsky 
in his memoirs a man from moscow published in 1967 and in a 
later book the man from odessa wynne revealed further details 
of his spying activities 
he described penkovsky as possibly the wests most valuable 
agent he said penkovsky provided him the names and photographs of 
about 300 east bloc intelligence agents details of soviet missile 
sites and an analysis of soviet military manpower and weapon 
production 
he said the double agent also told him soviet leader nikita 
khrushchev had allowed important guidance equipment to be sent with 
soviet missiles being installed in cuba 
the affair developed into the 1962 cuban missile crisis 
khrushchev later backed off and ordered the soviet missiles 
returned to the soviet union after president john f kennedy 
ordered a naval quarantine of cuba 
wynne said he was subjected to severe beatings and psychological 
pressure by the soviet kgm but he said his training with the mi6 
was even worse 
he said he was motivated by patriotism and a dislike of the 
soviet system 
after his release from prison he prospered as a property 
developer 
he was married twice his first wife sheila was present 
throughout his moscow trial but divorced him after his release 
they had one son

prime minister yitzhak shamir today ruled out 
the participation of palestinians from jerusalem in peace 
negotiations saying it would jeopardize israels claim to the holy 
city 
its clear that whoever lives in east jerusalem will not be 
able to participate in these negotiations said shamir 
shamir also expressed anger at suggestions apparently from us 
officials that israel should not settle soviet immigrants in the 
predominantly arab sector of jerusalem 
we are very upset by some statements about the immigration of 
soviet jewish people saying that they not be permitted to live in 
east jerusalem he said 
shamirs hardline remarks in an interview with the associated 
press raised questions about the prospects of success for us 
efforts to start a palestinianisraeli dialogue 
such efforts are at a critical juncture with shamir because he 
is under pressure from the rival labor party to make a decision by 
march 7 on whether to accept us proposals for starting talks he 
is also facing a major revolt by hawks in his likud bloc who oppose 
the negotiations 
shamir claimed he had support from 80 percent or more of his 
party he vowed to resolve the issue and provide the israeli 
cabinet with his final position in a few days or weeks 
reclining in an easy chair in his office here the 74yearold 
israeli leader listed jerusalem as the main stumbling block in 
bringing israeli and palestinian teams to the table in cairo 
jerusalem is a key question without any doubt we will not 
permit any attempt to undermine our position that jerusalem all of 
jerusalem will be the united capital of the state of israel 
jerusalem will not be a subject for negotiations with the arabs 
he said 
israel annexed the east part of jerusalem after capturing the 
predominantly arab sector from jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
the united states and most western countries do not recognize 
israels claim to east jerusalem 
shamir rejected the position of jerusalem mayor teddy kollek of 
the liberal labor party that participation of east jerusalem arabs 
was a technical problem that did not call into question israels 
claim to all of jerusalem as its capital 
it is naive to say that any participation of inhabitants of 
east jerusalem will not have an impact on the status of 
jerusalem shamir said we will see to it that the inhabitants 
of jerusalem will not take part in this election 
palestinians who seek to make the city the capital of an 
independent state have demanded that jerusalems 130000 arabs be 
allowed to participate in proposed palestinian elections in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the balloting would chose representatives to negotiate an 
interim selfgovernment plan for 17 million palestinians in the 
west bank and gaza strip where a 27monthold palestinian uprising 
against israeli occupation has left hundreds of arabs and about 40 
israelis dead 
the rightwing premier indicated he was not persuaded by us 
proposals to get around his objections by naming to a 10member 
negotiating team some arabs from east jerusalem who have alternate 
residences in the west bank 
it doesnt change the situation said shamir who stressed 
that the principle of safeguarding jerusalems status was at issue 
rather than individual names being floated as possible negotiators 
speaking on army radio deputy foreign minister benjamin 
netanyahu of shamirs likud bloc said us officials in washington 
this week suggested to him that settling soviet immigrants in east 
jerusalem was improper 
in light of such comments netanyahu said he questioned whether 
a framework exists today to continue the peace process 
these things raise doubts regarding the basis of understanding 
with the americans he said

two vietnamese deserters claimed 
today that thousands of vietnamese soldiers are in cambodia 
bolstering government forces who are besieged by guerrillas in the 
northwestern provinces 
interviews with the deserters added to mounting evidence that 
vietnamese troops secretly stayed behind or returned after vietnam 
announced the withdrawal of its last troops in september this 
week vietnam and its allied government in cambodia denied any 
vietnamese troops are in cambodia 
also today more than 2000 guerrillas attacked positions around 
the strategic town of svay chek in northwestern cambodia but 
government forces responded with thousands of rounds of heavy 
artillery 
the attack occurred one day after peace talks in jakarta 
indonesia broke down between the vietnameseinstalled government 
and a coalition of three guerrilla groups the communist khmer 
rouge the khmer peoples national liberation front and fighters 
loyal to prince norodom sihanouk 
the two vietnamese deserters were interviewed through a 
translator at boeung trakuen a khmer peoples front base about 10 
miles northwest of svay chek and near the thai border 
i left cambodia in september but was sent back in november 
said phu long hip who is from vietnams an veng province they 
told us we had to come back because we had not completed our 
mission 
mostly we are infantry troops but vietnamese officers also 
command tanks and artillery the 25yearold deserter said 
there are 300 men in my battalion and we are based at kompong 
puoy battambang province 
nguyen yang minh 28 said he was stationed in bolang district 
also in battambang since 1982 and stayed after the announced 
withdrawal 
minh said he was from vietnamese division 330 which the 
guerrillas claimed never left cambodia but rather was integrated 
with cambodian government units 
in april we switched to cambodian uniforms he said 
on one of minhs arms was a tatoo which said kampuchea 
882 the date he said arrived in cambodia on the other arm 
another tatoo said i have left home but i am still close to my 
mother 
he said he deserted because he was tired of being a soldier 
id like to live anywhere in the world but cambodia or vietnam 
he said 
commanders of the guerrillas who attacked svay chek today said 
more than 1000 vietnamese soldiers were helping government forces 
defend the town including officers leading artillery and tank 
units 
it is 100 percent that the vietnamese are back said gen 
pan thai chief of staff of the khmer peoples national liberation 
front everybody knows it now 
the guerrillas seized at least two key villages around the town 
today but retreated from them under the artillery bombardment two 
guerrillas were killed as heavy rounds pounded a guerrilla command 
post in the jungle about six miles east of svay chek 
the khmer rouge guerrilla group had claimed capturing several 
vietnamese soldiers just days after the september withdrawal 
thai and western intelligence sources say there has been a sharp 
increase in recent weeks of reports of vietnamese troops in 
battambang and banteay meanchey another western province 
there are numerous reports of vietnamese troops said a 
western diplomat in bangkok speaking on condition of anonymity 
we have no hard proof but the gut feeling is that there are 
there is too much evidence 
while attending cambodian peace talks in indonesia this week 
vietnamese foreign minister nguyen co thach denied any vietnamese 
troops remained in cambodia a foreign ministry spokeswoman ho the 
lan said the same thing at a weekly news conference in hanoi 
today the voice of vietnam radio said 
the civil war has gone on since vietnam invaded in late 1978 to 
oust the khmer rouge during the khmer rouges 3year rule 
hundreds of thousands of cambodians were killed or died of famine

mediumsecurity inmates will be doubled up 
in bunk beds for the first time next week in a move to relieve the 
backlog of state prisoners now held in county jails authorities 
said 
corrections commissioner thomas coughlin long an opponent of 
double bunking announced the plan wednesday it affects 10 prison 
dormitories not individual cells 
the move comes in the wake of several state prison disturbances 
that guards have linked to the housing of inmates in makeshift 
quarters in prison gymnasiums prison official say the gymnasiums 
will indeed be cleared under the plan but that that is not its main 
purpose 
on monday prison officials will begin to house up to 90 inmates 
in dormitories that have been housing 50 inmates coughlin said in 
all about 2240 inmates will be doublebunked over the next three 
months 
he said the move was necessary to comply with court orders that 
require new york state to take convicted inmates out of county 
jails more quickly there are 1200 convicted felons now housed 
in county jails across new york who belong in state prison 
coughlin said 
as of wednesday there were 51853 inmates in the states 
prisons system 21 percent more than the prisons were designed to 
hold new yorks prison population has more than doubled since 
1983 when gov mario cuomo took office 
the prison guards union council 82 was filing an improper 
practice charge over the plan and looking at other possible forms 
of litigation said its executive director joseph puma 
this addition of over 40 percent to the inmate population of 
dormitories which are already at or over capacity is an 
invitation to disaster he said 
currently inmates in the mediumsecurity dormitories sleep in 
three rows of single beds one row down each side of the dorm and 
one down the middle under coughlins plan bunk beds will be 
installed for the two outside rows said james flateau a spokesman 
for the state criminal justice department the center row of beds 
will be left single for security reasons he said

the city council unanimously repealed a 
decision to study the idea of distributing free cocaine and other 
narcotics to drug users in treatment 
the repeal wednesday night followed nearly a week of criticism 
from law enforcement officials and politicians including mayor w 
wilson goode who called the study a waste of time district 
attorney ronald castille said a freedrug program would violate 
state and federal laws 
councilman john street had proposed the study saying he 
believed the city was totally losing the war against drugs 
last week without discussion the council approved streets 
request for studies of the legal and medical implications of 
treating various drug addicts with a system similar to the 
methadone clinics for heroin addicts 
after a storm of criticism two councilmen circulated 
resolutions to kill the study before street offered his own which 
passed unanimously

the sources who spoke on condition that they not be identified 
said the satellite was smoothly placed into orbit this morning and 
that atlantis is now set to land at 1034 am pst sunday at 
edwards air force base calif

mission nasa will give no details on activities of the fivemember 
crew but in a threesentence statement released today nasa 
confirmed that the expected landing day is sunday the agency 
did not say what time the landing would be 
the atlantis crew is doing well and orbiter atlantis 
continues to perform satisfactorily the mission control

satellite capable of taking supersharp photographs and listening 
in on electronic communications around the world according to 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity

all was well with the astronauts and that the silence was to 
continue unless a serious problem occurred

to launch from cape canaveral fla early wednesday as the 
shuttle rocketed into space the blue white and red light of its 
rockets was visible as far up the east coast as washington dc

of the world than any previous shuttle in that orbit the 
satellite can be put in a position to observe military bases and

japanese physicists say us plans to shut 
down a test reactor at the hanford nuclear reservation would 
violate an international agreement and jeopardize future scientific 
partnerships between the two countries 
in a letter to energy secretary james d watkins made public 
today officials for the japan atomic energy reserach institute 
said the administrations intention to shut down the fast flux test 
facility at richlanot help but impact negatively 
efforts toward future cooperation 
sigeru mori chairman od wash cannf the institutes fusion power 
coordinating committee said discontinuation of fftf would kill 
japanese tests at the facility and more than five years of 
intense international collaboration on solid breeder materials 
for fusion blankets 
it appears obvious that with the intent to shut down fftf that 
you would imply an intent to break the agreement since no other 
us reactor has equivalent capabilities mori wrote in the feb 
22 letter 
the letter was made public today by aides to rep sid morrison

dog owners weary of lugging bowser into the 
bathtub for his saturday night sudsing are driving to washingtons 
new dog wash where the customers exit with hair ribbons 
instead of a slap on the bumper with a soggy towel 
at tristate k9 service which offers a sort of selfserve car 
wash for canines in the southern maryland suburbs of washington 
dc its heavy on the shampoo and flea dip and please hold the 
wax 
at home it gets so messy in my bathroom said jean burson 
who was grooming her freshly bathed irish setter april i was 
always drenched and there was dog hair everywhere clogging the 
drain 
this is not aprils favorite thing of the day but it makes it 
a lot easier for me 
tristates owner craig jolly said he opened the dog wash at 
his boarding kennel and obedience training school in december for 
the convenience of owners who want wellgroomed pets without the 
fuss of bathing them at home 
theres no heavy lifting here doggie customers climb wooden 
ramps that deposit them effortlessly into porcelain bathtubs 
equipped with overhead hoses 
i know people whove gotten a bad back from lifting their 
150pound dogs into the bath jolly says a pregnant woman came 
in here recently with a 120pound rottweiler so she sure didnt 
want to wash that dog at home 
the 999 price of the dog wash includes use of shampoos and 
dips brushes scissors grooming shears nail clippers and 
shoulderharness blow dryers for the owners use along with 
plastic aprons to keep them dry 
jolly also supplies spray colognes for pooches with stubborn 
body odors and keeps a glass jar full of brightly colored hair 
bows to pin on poodles and other small dogs as they prance out the 
door 
jolly got the dog wash idea from a trade magazine article about 
similar facilities that opened a few years ago in chicago then in 
california but when business picks up in the spring jolly plans 
to add some luxurious touches worthy of a beverly hills spaniel spa 
im going to get an exercise treadmill he said and a 
whirlpool bath for arthritic dogs and over against that wall ill 
set up a little dog deli with chewy bones and toys liver treats 
dog milkshakes and beef rawhides that look like hamburgers and link 
sausages 
tristates motto is dogs are our only business but a woman 
telephoned recently to inquire whether she could bring in her very 
dirty cat for a wash 
i said this is for dogs only and besides i thought cats 
washed themselves said manager arthur hamer she said shed 
call me back and hung up 
somebody is probably going to bring in a cat or a pet rabbit 
someday jolly said ill let them use the dog wash if they 
want to try

casino which is scheduled to open april 2 with a formal 
ribboncutting three days later after a shakedown period 
on april 4 the day adams said the appearance of trump and 
maples is scheduled trump is scheduled to be at a real estate 
dinner in new york city ms tuso said 
trumps attorneys say he plans to divorce his wife ivana under 
a prenuptial agreement that entitles her to about 25 million but 
her attorneys say mrs trump should receive a much bigger slice of 
trumps reported 17 billion fortune 
mrs trumps lawyer michael kennedy presented a letter to 
trumps attorney wednesday claiming a december 1987 update of the 
prenuptial agreement contains an important omission 
it refers to separate property which under new york law 
means holdings held by the partners before a marriage and makes no 
reference to marital property which means assets accumulated 
during a marriage the letter said 
if he insists that mrs trump has waived or released her 
rights to marital property it will be necessary for us to 
undertake appropriate action on behalf of mrs trump kennedy 
wrote in other words mrs trumps attorneys might try to use the 
omission as the basis of a court challenge to the agreement 
trumps lawyers jay goldberg and stanford lotwin said in a 
statement that the maneuver by mrs trumps side was pathetic 
the daily news reported that the 1987 agreement between trump 
and mrs trump gives her the right to stay in the couples trump 
tower apartment as long as the marriage is in effect but offers a 
4 million housing allowance if she leaves before the divorce 
is final

the bush administration would go along with 
cuts to the two largest recipients of us foreign aid israel and 
egypt if it were part of a broader acrosstheboard reduction in 
aid to other friendly countries secretary of state james a baker 
iii told congress today 
were willing to stand up and be counted on such a cut in 
aid if congress allowed the administration more flexibility to use 
the limited money where it is most needed baker said 
responding to a question by rep david obey dwis chairman of 
the house appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations baker 
said administration support would depend on whether we do it in a 
nondiscriminatory manner 
in recent travels in the middle east baker said he has not 
found any significant reduction in the threat to peace but he 
added at the same time we must find a way to respond to changes 
in eastern europe in panama and in nicaragua 
baker said he did not want to see a repetition of the current 
years budget crunch in which some friendly countries that 
expected us aid got little or nothing because 90 percent of the 
aid budget was already earmarked by congress for certain other 
recipients 
we ought not to be hidebound by whats been done over the past 
10 years baker said 
his comments marked the first time the administration has 
specifically said it could accept cuts to israel and egypt which 
get the largest slice of us aid as a result of their 
participation in the camp david middle east peace accord a decade 
ago 
israel is receiving a total of 3 billion this year and egypt 
21 billion out of a roughly 10 billion overall budget for 
bilateral aid the administration has asked congress for the same 
amounts for both countries next year 
earlier this year senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
proposed cutting 5 percent from the top five aid recipients to 
create more money in the budget for emerging democracies and other 
needs 
the administration denied planting the idea with dole at the 
time but expressed agreement with its goal of increased flexibility 
in distributing aid money

drivers at greyhound lines threatened a strike at 
midnight against the only nationwide intercity bus company a move 
that could hurt travelers least able to afford it 
you may not see a lot of threepiecesuiters feeling bad that 
one aspect of public transportation has been hurt but you will see 
a whole lot more people care about it in round numbers than if 
amtrak closed its doors tomorrow said steve sprague spokesman 
for the united bus owners of america 
the amalgamated council of greyhound local unions which 
represents 6300 drivers and 3075 office and maintenance workers 
said it would strike at midnight tonight unless talks in 
scottsdale ariz produced a new contract 
talks involving subcommittees continued today but union 
spokesman jeffrey nelson said we are more are more concerned 
than ever that greyhound management simply is not prepared to 
negotiate in good faith that they are not interested in attaining 
a fair and equitable contract 
nelson said that because the full negotiating committees are not 
face to face the talks cannot be characterized as negotiations 
the company said the chief negotiators for both sides are 
discussing the main economic issues and management objected to 
characterizations of the talks as lowlevel 
the main issues revolve around salary with the company offering 
a firstyear raise of 69 percent the company says the union wants 
a 33 percent increase in the first year nelson called this figure 
misleading and false but would not supply the unions estimate 
greyhound drivers earned an average of 24743 last year the 
company said 
greyhound said it will use drivers hired in the past two weeks 
to operate a limited schedule it plans to be back at full strength 
by the end of the month the company also said it will turn over 
some routes to regional carriers 
there are 500 airports and 500 train stations but buses serve 
just over 10000 communities in the country sprague said for 
rural communities it is lots of times the only lifeline 
existence 
a decline in bus service will be felt unfortunately by a class 
of people who really dont have alternatives some because of price 
and some because of the destination they go to is not served any 
other way he said 
greyhound figures show 26 percent of its passengers are 16 to 24 
years old and 151 percent are over 65 just under half have a 
household income of less than 15000 a year 
dallasbased greyhound was formed three years ago by fred g 
currey who led an investor group that paid 270 million to 
greyhound corp for its operation four months later curreys 
group paid 80 million for faltering trailways lines inc 
greyhound had 22 million passengers last year when the company 
says it earned its first profit about 730000 on about 1 billion 
in revenue 
greyhound went through two strikes while a subsidiary of 
phoenixbased greyhound corp the most recent a 1983 walkout that 
lasted 48 days 
in michigan rural suomi college braced for a strike by 
chartering two buses to give its 200 students a way home when 
spring break begins friday 
we just decided we wouldnt wait to hear and have a bunch of 
students stranded said debbie lyttinen secretary to the dean

czechoslovaksoviet military 
exercises began in the western part of the country thursday the 
state ctk news agency said 
the brief dispatch gave no details beyond saying that about 
5000 czechoslovak and 1200 soviet troops members of the central 
group of soviet forces in czechoslovakia were participating 
the exercises began four days after the historic start of a 
complete red army pullback from czechoslovakia the maneuvers were 
first made public in czechoslovakia as the withdrawals began and 
the timing was possibly meant as a signal that the country remains 
a dependable political ally despite the pullout and its 
noncommunist leadership 
the last of 73500 soviet troops is scheduled to leave in 
mid1991 marking an end to more than two decades of the red armys 
presence soviet soldiers headed a partial warsaw pact invasion in 
1968 which crushed attempts at political liberalization that 
became known as the prague sping

shevardnadzes trip to japan and visits by the leaders of egypt and 
ireland an official said thursday

soviet leaders including an extraordinary session of the congress 
of peoples deputies which was ordered this week to convene march 
12 
were guilty gerasimov quipped to reporters who asked if 
the postponements were a sign of shifts in kremlin relations with 
the other countries he said the only reason for the delays was the 
need to focus on domestic affairs

in the battle over licensing of the 
seabrook nuclear plant supporters and foes agree on one thing at 
least the decision was put off too long 
i never thought it would take this long said former gov 
meldrim thomson a seabrook proponent who served from 1973 to 1979 
if any human being could dream up anything worse they would have 
to work at it 
on the other side antiseabrook protester dianne dunfey also 
criticized delays in the ruling by the nuclear regulatory 
commission which today licensed the nuclear power plant to begin 
producing commercial electricity 
barring further court maneuvering the nrc decision sets the 
stage for the 1150megawatt reactor to begin operating at full 
power within three months the boards decision was by a 30 vote 
and ratified recommendations by the commissions staff and several 
lowerlevel boards 
the nrc is one of the most disreputable of all government 
agencies said dunfey a seabrook schoolteacher who was released 
from jail last week after serving a five days for refusing to pay a 
fine over a seabrookrelated sitin 
it has ignored public input she said it either discarded 
or amended all of its own regulations any time seabrook couldnt 
meet one 
asked why the licensing procedure took as long as it did nrc 
spokesman john kopeck in washington said there was a legal 
process that it had to go through there were a lot of steps that 
had to be taken 
when the plant was proposed in 1968 by public service company of 
new hampshire the cost was estimated at 978 million that has 
swelled to 65 billion the utility filed for bankruptcy 
protection in 1988 in part because of the costs of the plant 
environmentalists have been battling the utility and nrc over 
seabrook since 1976 when the clamshell alliance staged its first 
display of civil disobedience shortly before the aug 5 
groundbreaking thousands have since been arrested 
the final step in the licensing process for the plant 40 miles 
north of boston has done little to calm the emotions that made 
seabrook a symbol of the antinuclear movement 
the main sticking point to licensing has been federally mandated 
evacuation plans for communities within 10 miles of the plant 
which is near popular hampton beach opponents maintain the area is 
too densely populated to evacuate quickly 
i think its a disgrace said russ arscott a seabrook 
resident for 61 years theres no way to evacuate the area i 
just hope the pipes all hold 
ray colbert moved to hampton beach last year knowing little 
about the plant which can be seen from his porch he said he plans 
to move to florida in may partly because of the reactor 
i might stay if that thing wasnt so close he said but 
ive got a 5monthold daughter i want to get her the hell out 
of here before they fire that thing up 
others look forward to the day the plant finally produces 
electricity 
we need it said thelma grinnell a resident of nearby 
salisbury mass for the past 25 years we need something other 
than fossil fuels were destroying the environment 
the evacuation zone has a population of 148000 which swells to 
a summertime peak of 247000 the plants operator new hampshire 
yankee estimates it could take up to 10 hours to move people out 
of the zone in an emergency 
on a summer day according to deputy massachusetts attorney 
general stephen jonas there are more people within three miles of 
the seabrook reactor than any other reactor in the country 
anybody whos been in a traffic jam near the plant during 
the summer knows that in a panic situation evacuation would be 
impossible said sen gordon humphrey rnh 
seabrook proponents including former gov john sununu now 
white house chief of staff say the plans will work

eat eat we must survive this war 
amin daher exhorted his nervous family as exploding artillery 
shells rocked his apartment in christian east beirut 
his wife angele wearily picked up the fork that kept slipping 
from her trembling fingers and rattled against her plate with each 
shell blast 
may god enlighten them may god enlighten them she 
murmured picking at a lunch of lentils and rice fried cauliflower 
and eggplant and cabbage salad 
the dahers shared the lunch one day recently with a couple of 
neighbors spread around a table in one of their apartments 
bedrooms that has been turned into a makeshift shelter 
their fivestory apartment building like many built before the 
civil war began in april 1975 has no basement shelter 
everyone flinched as shells fired by fellow christians exploded 
around their building 
we have to keep going despite the grim future that awaits 
us daher said we should never give up 
the family used to climb down to share the shelter of a 
neighboring building but that has come to be increasingly 
dangerous 
besides mrs daher has a weak heart and her husband suffers 
from asthma so the children fortified the bedroom with stone 
blocks 
the stone protects them from blast and shrapnel but would not 
save them from a direct hit still its better than nothing 
when the shelling is heavy the dahers and some neighbors crowd 
into the 10footby10foot room and sleep on the floor they have 
taken the beds out to make room for everyone 
beside a flickering candle a small statue of the virgin mary 
stands atop the tv set the set is of no other use there is no 
electricity 
life has come down to just filling our bellies what kind of 
life is this what kind of future will my children have lamented 
the tall balding daher 64 a retired customs officer 
the apartment building is in the ashrafiyeh district which lies 
on the green line dividing beirut 
the district has been continuously battered since 1975 it was 
the scene of heavy fighting in the first two years of the conflict 
between christians and moslems 
the syrians besieged it for 100 days in 1978 pounding it with 
artillery fire since then moslem gunners and snipers routinely 
have fired into the buildings more exposed than most because 
ashrafiyeh sits atop the highest hill in beirut 
more than 150000 people are estimated to have been killed in 
the civil war twice as many wounded and another 1 million one 
fourth of the prewar population displaced 
in the current bloodletting rebel gen michel aouns troops are 
battling the lebanese forces militia commanded by onetime medical 
student samir geagea for control of the 310squaremile christian 
enclave north of beirut 
nearly 700 people have been killed and 2000 wounded in the 
confrontation so far 
ashrafiyeh is one of geageas two remaining strongholds in east 
beirut which makes it a target for aouns artillery and tanks 
aoun holds the districts to the east the green line hems 
ashrafiyeh in to the southeast while the mediterranean lies to the 
north 
the dahers live with four of their children sons nazih 32 a 
civil defense worker nadim 28 an administrator with the labor 
ministry elie 25 who works in a boutique and daughter nada 21 
a computer major 
their eldest son najib was killed four months after the civil 
war started when he was 19 a married daughter maha 30 lives in 
the mountain resort of bikfaya which has escaped most of the 
fighting 
nazih has been missing since the latest fighting began jan 30 
he was visiting friends in the port of jounieh north of beirut 
when aoun moved against geagea 
aouns troops hold the area between jounieh and ashrafiyeh all 
the telephone lines have been cut so one knows if hes alive or 
dead 
we just dont know anything about nazih his distraught 
mother whispered we sent him a message over the radio that were 
all fine i hope he heard it 
nearly onefourth of ashrafiyehs estimated 150000 inhabitants 
have fled to safer areas but the dahers have nowhere to go no 
relatives living in safer zones 
as if mrs daher 54 didnt have enough troubles elie is 
bedridden with the flu 
the doctors in our area have all left we couldnt find 
vitamins for him i hope his condition doesnt deteriorate she 
said as she squeezed a few shriveled oranges she found in a nearby 
shop to make juice for elie 
the dahers car was hit by a mortar round the second day of the 
fighting their kitchen took a direct hit two weeks later but no 
one was hurt 
we shouldnt be sad about material losses they can be 
replaced but human lives mrs daher said her gaze wandered 
to a framed photo of her dead son on the wall of the shabby living 
room 
the dahers like many other lebanese families have learned to 
adjust to the seemingly endless violence 
we shave every four days and save water by using the water we 
wash our clothes and the dishes with to flush the toilet elie

martin luther king iii apologized today for 
saying something may be wrong with homosexuals which sparked 
anger among gay rights leaders 
king the son of the late civil rights leader said the legacy 
of his fathers life was the struggle to free this country of 
bigotry and discrimination in that light he said he needed to 
examine his own feelings about the problems faced by gays and 
lesbians 
king a fulton county commissioner enraged gays on tuesday when 
he told middle school students in poughkeepsie ny that 
homosexuals have a problem 
now something may be wrong in the makeup of that individual if 
they happen to be that way he said any man that has a desire 
to be with another man has a problem in my opinion and that 
applies to any woman who has a desire to be with another woman 
but today he said the statements were uninformed and 
insensitive 
for this i extend my sincere apology to the entire community 
and in particular to the gay and lesbian community certainly which 
has been hurt most by this incident king said at the brief news 
conference he took no questions 
bill gripp one of several gay rights leaders who met privately 
with king after the conference said he was satisfied with the 
apology 
i congratulated him on his statement gripp said i 
couldnt have liked it more if id written it myself 
the new yorkbased gay and lesbian alliance against defamation 
called kings remarks strange and upsetting and the atlanta 
gay center requested the meeting with king to discuss the remarks

cia director william webster said thursday 
reversing the radical changes in eastern europe is highly unlikely 
with little chance of the soviets regaining their domination and 
the communist party near ruin 
as these upheavals continue to gain momentum they will be 
progressively more difficult to suppress webster told the house 
armed services committee in an unclassified assessment of the 
dramatic push toward democracy in the eastern bloc 
the result of these sweeping changes is a diminished soviet 
threat that significantly reduces the likelihood of an attack on 
us and western european forces while increasing the length of 
time it would take the soviets to mobilize he said 
the cia director said a reversal in the reforms could occur in 
the soviet union if president mikhail s gorbachev is ousted but 
that the kremlin leader recently strengthened his hold on power and 
his removal is unlikely 
hardliners in the soviet union face a daunting task with the 
call for reforms highly popular and returning the country to the 
old policies nearly impossible 
those demanding an acceleration of reform still have the upper 
hand and many soviet citizens are pressing for radical 
change webster said 
traditionalists if they succeeded gorbachev would have to 
revive the military policies of the past as well as the costly 
weaponsbuying agenda or create a new approach said the cia chief 
either course would be disruptive and expensive and would 
result in significantly lower readiness at least in the short 
term webster said more importantly rebuilding forces to 
traditional levels would be unpopular with a populace weary of 
shortages and sacrifices 
the soviets overriding concern would be solving the widespread 
economic problems not building up the military webster predicted 
that any successor to gorbachev would pursue arms controls pacts 
with the west 
it would be unlikely to seek a broad reversal of the 
changes that have occurred in eastern europe or to try to revive 
the warsaw pact he said 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee described websters comments as remarkable and 
suggested that this assessment puts the united states in kind of 
a winwin situation 
aspin made the comments before closing the questionandanswer 
portion of the hearing to the public and news media 
in his statement the cia director also raised doubts about 
hardliners using the soviet military as a police force that could 
put down reform movements among the people 
if faced with large and widespread unrest they would be 
severely tested webster said there is no way to predict how 
military commanders and troops would respond if ordered to fire on 
civilians 
but soviet hardliners would remember that romanian armed 
forces ultimately refused to save the ceausescu regime from the 
wrath of its people and instead joined in toppling him he said 
elections in the 15 soviet republics during the next few months 
will strengthen the reform effort and pressure the kremlin to step 
up the pace of change 
webster predicted that the baltic states will likely work out an 
amicable separation from the soviet union during the next few 
years but ethnic and religious problems in central asia and the 
caucasus will continue and moscow might choose to use its military 
forces as it did in azerbaijan 
webster acknowledged that a crackdown on reform efforts similar 
to the action china took last june in putting down the revolt in 
beijings tiananmen square could occur elsewhere 
but in eastern europe and the soviet union it would be much 
more difficult and costly for hardliners to reverse reform than it 
has been in china so far

when it determines the veterans eligibility for ssi 
the supplemental security income program provides monthly 
benefits to 45 million aged blind and disabled people who have 
little or no income and resources maximum monthly benefits this

november 1981 should call or visit ssa to see if they are eligible 
for additional benefits individuals who think they might be 
affected by the ruling should mention the court ruling known as 
the anderson case when they contact social security

redoubt volcano roared back to life 
with two eruptions inside an hour that sent a gray sooty column 
more than seven miles into the sky and dropped ash for the first 
time on anchorage 
the volcano settled down late wednesday and remained quiet this 
morning but tremors beneath the mountain led scientists to believe 
it may erupt again soon 
the volcano 115 miles southwest of anchorage painted clouds a 
dark gray over alaskas largest city then dusted the snowcovered 
city of 173000 with abrasive ash another snowfall this morning 
largely covered the ash 
an anchorage hospital handed out several hundred free masks to 
people complaining of respiratory problems and some pedestrians 
wore scarves over their faces some flights in and out of anchorage 
were disrupted 
a moderate eruption was registered shortly before 9 am ast 
and a much stronger blast at 947 am sent a plume 37000 feet 
into the air about an hour later said tom miller of the alaska 
volcano observatory 
its been quiet since the last explosion said john ewert 
another spokesman from the observatory 
he added there has been a lot of earthquake activity over the 
last several days as long as this activity continues we see an 
increased level of concern for explosive activity in the near 
future 
the 10197foot peak sprang back to life in middecember after 
being quiet for more than two decades and has erupted 
intermittently since 
superior court judge karl johnstone expressing concern that 
jurors wouldnt be able to get home because of limited driving 
visibility recessed the criminal trial of exxon valdez skipper 
joseph hazelwood two hours early 
at elmendorf air force base just north of anchorage aircraft 
were put in hangars a big cloud moved over nothing fell out of 
it after it passed ash started falling said sgt dave 
haulbrook a base spokesman 
a number of delta united and sas flights were delayed or 
diverted from anchorage international airport which remained open 
said marsha sampson a spokeswoman 
anchorage police were issued masks and air filters for their 
patrol cars 
thats just for those whose cars suddenly need a filter 
change and for anyone having to work outside said police 
spokesman walt monegan 
the drift river oil terminal was evacuated as a precaution said 
dave mcdowell of the state division of emergency services in nearby 
wasilla 
most of the oil was drained after earlier redoubt eruptions 
because of concern that flooding in the adjacent drift river could 
damage the tanks and send oil into the fishrich cook inlet 
miller said scientists ability to predict the mountains 
activity remains limited because of equipment damage from an 
eruption last week 
we still dont have our summit station he said

postmaster general anthony m frank says he is 
optimistic about the future despite the fact that the post office 
is preparing to raise rates as it faces the largest dollar loss in 
postal history 
frank said he is encouraged because productivity has increased 
in recent months the pending rate increase will improve finances 
and more automation is being introduced 
plans for a 1991 increase in the price of sending mail 
including a 30cent stamp for first class letters are expected to 
be announced next week 
the postal service is expected to complete this fiscal year 16 
billion in the red frank told the house post office and civil 
service committee 
it may seem paradoxical to say so but i can tell you that i 
am more optimistic about the postal service now than ive been 
since i came here said frank who is just completing two years 
in office 
frank has set a goal of having bar codes those rows of little 
lines similar to the price codes in grocery stores on all mail by 
1995 as part of his automation program with the codes the 
majority of mail handling can be done by machine prior to final 
delivery 
we expect more changes in the postal service in the next five 
years than in the past 200 and thats not an overstatement 
frank told the committee 
labor negotiations this summer offer a chance to increase union 
cooperation in improving postal operations frank added 
in the labor negotiations we are going to ask our employees 
representatives to show some constructive restraint said frank 
both wage restraint and more flexibility in scheduling are 
needed to take advantage of automation he said 
no one working for the postal service need fear for their job 
however he said we can make all the adjustments we need to stay 
competitive through attrition 
if firstclass rates rise to 30 cents that would mean they have 
gone up more than inflation since the last hike in 1988 
thats totally unacceptable to the people who pay our bills 
and its unacceptable to me said frank ive set a goal of 
getting to the point where our costs will be kept a full 2 percent 
below inflation 
the rate case will also include some lower rates for bulk mail 
that can be handled by machinery in an effort to encourage large 
mailing firms to prepare the mail in a way machinery can deal with 
it he said 
asked about an office of management and budget proposal for a 
special lower rate for government agencies frank said the 
estimated 220 million cost of that cut would simply have to be 
shifted to others who use the mail 
the post office no longer receives any government subsidy so it 
has to cover its expenses with income and any cut in money coming 
in has to be balanced by charging someone else more 
there probably are 200 million in savings available to 
government agencies if they would simply use the bulk rate 
discounts available now frank said 
rep william d ford dmich told frank that he and other 
committee members plan to oppose an administration proposal to 
shift 13 billion in federal retirement costs to the postal 
service 
this is simoply an arbitrary grab to get some cash said 
ford

gen michel aouns tanks pierced the 
defenses of the rival christian militia in savage fighting thursday 
in east beirut as the showdown entered its second month 
police said at least 14 people were killed and 50 wounded in 
seven assaults by aouns americanmade m48 tanks against the urban 
lines of samir geageas lebanese forces militia 
by police count the fight for control of the 310squaremile 
christian enclave has killed 708 people and wounded 1984 since it 
broke out jan 30 
a police spokesman reported minor progress by aouns tanks 
which advanced over nine hours across the open terrain to the edge 
of the urban area of nabaa a pocket held by the lebanese forces 
the advance shattered a 12day lull that followed a ceasefire 
called by a neutral mediation committee 
the tanks are at the entrances to the narrow alleys of the 
densely populated lowincome district the spokesman said 
he said it would be extremely dangerous to push the tanks 
into the slumlike district where they would be easy targets for 
geageas experienced street fighters using armorpiercing 
rocketpropelled grenade launchers 
the advance stopped at 2 pm after the captain commanding the 
attack was killed but the two sides maintained a fierce exchange 
of howitzer and mortar shells at the rate of about 40 rounds a 
minute said the spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
he said aouns tanks had failed to advance along the slopes of 
ashrafiyeh the militias second stronghold in east beirut the 
neighborhood spills over the highest hill in the lebanese capital 
a dozen fires blazed out of control in ashrafiyeh and nabaa 
smoke billowed from the districts and the fire department said its 
engines were not able to leave their underground basement centers 
to combat the blaze due to the intensity of the clashes 
christian radio stations repeatedly interrupted regular 
programming to flash reports on fires in ashrafiyeh and nabaa and 
urge fire fighters to deal with them 
aouns command in a communique said geageas gunners were 
pounding residential districts under the armys control from 
multibarrelled rocket launchers capable of spitting out 40 
projectiles a minute 
the communique said the militia fire also targeted aouns 
headquarter at the shellwrecked presidential palace in of baabda 
east of the capital 
aouns 19000strong army controls the southeastern sector of 
east beirut as well as baabda nearby hazmiyeh and fayadiyeh and 
the metin mountains 
the lebanese forces which has a hardcore strength of 6000 
fighters and can call up a reserve force of 30000 controls 
twothirds of the christian enclave including the two pockets in 
east beirut 
the militias area also covers the kesrouan hinterland north of 
the capital adjacent byblos province and part of the batroun 
province which borders syrian army lines 
a mediation committee of three independent christian figures 
called a ceasefire for 130 pm but fierce shelling duels 
persisted throughout the day 
the lebanese forces command in a communique said aouns troops 
did not achieve any significant gains 
the communique repeatedly broadcast by the progeagea voice of 
lebanon radio station said the militias defenses were solid and 
the morale of our fighters is very high 
the militia has 2000 fighters in the east beirut pockets linked 
with its main bases in kesrouan only by maritime supply lines 
because aouns troops control the road between the areas 
a military source speaking on condition of anonymity said aoun 
chose a stormy day to launch his new offensive in an apparent 
effort to benefit from the rough sea which reflects negatively on 
the lebanese forces maritime supply line 
the militia had made use of the 12day lull to stockpile 
weapons ammunition medicines food water and fuel supplies 
according to the police spokesman 
the military source noted that aoun deployed 130mm sovietmade 
howitzers in the battle thursday instead of the armys standard 
usmade 155mm guns which reflected his bad need for 
ammunition 
geageas militia captured more than 50000 155mm howitzer shells 
when they overran aouns depots at the sarba garrison in kesrouan 
early in february the source said

police sgt robert wolfgang she should have been issued the ticket 
at the scene of the accident tuesday night but the officer hadnt 
noticed that ms cuomos license had expired wolfgang said

the defense department may shrink by several 
hundred thousand employees in the next three or four years as a 
result of budget cuts and arms control treaties defense secretary 
dick cheney said thursday 
cheney testifying before the house foreign affairs committee 
provided an overview of defense department policies in a 
wideranging session with lawmakers 
cheney stood by the bush administrations plan to cut troop 
levels in europe allowing 195000 us troops in the european 
central zone and 30000 troops elsewhere in europe the troop plan 
was ironed out by secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in ottawa canada last week 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine on thursday 
joined sen sam nunn dga in criticizing the plan for failing to 
give the united states enough flexibility air force secretary 
donald rice has also questioned the plan 
but cheney said that 195000 is the administrations policy 
the white house has also reaffirmed support for the 
bakershevardnadze deal 
cheney meantime said proposed language in the conventional 
forces in europe treaty which the united states and the soviet 
union hope to conclude this year calls for a demobilization of 
roughly 30000 to 35000 us troops 
thats the treaty requirement yes but were probably looking 
at much larger reductions on the basis of budget constraints 
cheney said 
while he refused to cite hard figures cheney said i would 
speculate that over the next several years three or four years 
we are looking at reductions in the overalll size of the defense 
department of several hundred thousand 
cheney said the soviets want a longer time five to seven years 
opposed to three to five years to demobilize their troops because 
moscow expects difficulty repatriating their forces at home 
he also said there may be additional us troop reductions in 
korea and japan 
most of the reductions in the pentagons 21 million workforce 
would occur by slowing down the number of people brought into the 
system he said but he said officials are making longrange plans 
to prepare for those leaving the services including housing and 
education 
besides discussing manpower cheney pleaded with house members 
to use their influence so he can channel or reprogram 852 
million from procurement and research programs to the personnel 
account 
without permission from congress to make such a change the 
pentagon will be forced to lay off people freeze promotions and 
take other drastic management steps cheney said 
this is a classic example of how congress can do serious 
damage to our military capability longterm damage of the kind 
none of us wants to see cheney said 
the house and senate armed services committees as well as the 
appropriations committees would have to approve reprogramming rep 
les aspin dwis chairman of the house panel said he is opposed 
to reprogramming 
the budget crunch occurred because the military was included in 
deficit reduction cuts mandated by the grammrudman act 
on other issues cheney 
defended the decision to send egypt some 700 tanks that are to 
be declared surplus by us troops in europe he said the tanks 
will replace aging equipment and israel had been consulted about 
the deal 
predicted tough negotiations over the future of two us bases 
in the philippines 
engaged in a heated discussion with rep peter kostmayer 
dpa over the proposed 303 billion pentagon budget for fiscal 
1991 
youre not going to get 303 billion and you dont deserve 
it said kostmayer 
at one point cheney objected to an interruption by kostmayer 
you had your chance congressman now its my turn

president bush today denied reports that any 
breakthrough is near on release of americans held hostage in 
lebanon and said there are no secret talks going on 
he told reporters that a spate of recent news reports concerning 
movement in the hostage situation are ridiculous stories 
however he said i dont spend a day that i dont think about 
the hostages i will do everything i can to win their freedom 
bush said that when he heard the recent reports of secret 
usiranian talks in geneva regarding the hostages which 
originated with a londonbased arab newspaper he asked national 
security adviser brent scowcroft to check into their veracity 
scowcroft reported back there are no talks going on bush 
said 
his denial was in line with statements earlier this week by 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater and other 
administration officials throwing cold water on reports of progress 
in efforts to free the hostages 
moslem militants with ties to iran are believed to be holding 18 
western hostages including eight americans in lebanon the 
longest held is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for 
the associated press who was kidnapped of a beirut street in march 
1985 
bush said he was open to any talks that could free the american 
captives i hope the hostages will be released if i see an 
opportunity for talks in private or in public about this to get 
them released ill do it he said as he left his hotel to visit 
a new los angeles county jail 
he said he had read of a supposed conversation he had with 
french president francois mitterrand regarding the hostages 
there never was such a conversation he said 
as to the most recent reports that the united states secretly 
was talking with representatives of the iranian government in 
geneva bush said 
if i thought a talk in geneva would result in letting people 
go free i would undertake the talks if i thought the way to 
conduct those talks was to do it quietly i would if i thought the 
best way to get the hostages out was to publicly have talks in 
geneva i would do that 
i will do everything i can to get them out of there the 
president said 
he also said there were no talks under way that i know of 
between the united states and syrian intermediaries

construction spending rose 18 percent in 
january the biggest increase in more than a year the government 
said thursday analysts said the warmest january on record caused 
the improvement 
the commerce department said residential nonresidential and 
government construction spending totaled a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 424 billion in january the gain was the largest 
since a 23 percent advance in december 1988 
the january increase came after a 01 percent decline in 
december 
it was the warmest january since the government began keeping 
track of temperatures 96 years ago while december was the fourth 
coldest on record 
if you average january and december you come up with a number 
more in line with what we saw in the previous four months said 
david berson chief economist with the federal national mortgage 
association 
december was not as bad as it appeared and january is not as 
good as it appears he said 
berson said lower mortgage interest rates should produce a 
slight improvement in the months ahead 
spending on residential building was up 29 percent to 1958 
billion on an annual rate in january largely due to a 24 percent 
gain in singlefamily homes multifamily spending was flat at 
204 billion residential spending accounts for about 50 percent 
of the total 
nonresidential construction spending was up 59 percent to an 
annual rate of 1008 billion boosted in part by a 15 percent gain 
in the industrial category 
the oftenvolatile government sector however declined 42 
percent to 4909 billion after rising 68 percent in december 
government spending represents about 20 percent of construction 
spending 
leading the fall in that sector was a 13 percent decline in 
spending on highways and streets

one city struck by a jolting earthquake 
estimated damage at 20 million today as safety inspectors across 
the region began a streetbystreet look at their communities 
older buildings and roads 
wednesdays quake measured at 55 on the richter scale and 
triggered rock slides broke windows crumbled a warehouse wall and 
swayed skyscrapers as far away as las vegas nearly 200 miles from

two people suffered broken legs and one woman went into early 
labor during the 343 pm temblor said upland councilman tom 
mcgilloway the citys acting mayor he did not have details on how 
the injuries occurred 
it was the strongest quake in california since the oct 17 one

president bush today praised law enforcement 
officials as unsung heroes as he toured a new 2064bed jail 
that he said proved tough talk is simply not enough in fighting 
crime 
bush was given a tour of the notyetopened los angeles north 
county correctional facility by sheriff sherman block who showed 
him the spartan cells in the maximumsecurity facility 
the president said after his brief tour i will never forget 
it it was long enough to bring anyone face to face with the 
results of what institutions like this represent capacity for 
violence the power of corruption the ability to turn our back on 
right and do wrong 
a major part of bushs own anticrime package is concentrated on 
prison expansion 
addressing lawenforcement officers outside the prison bush 
said all too often you are the unsung heroes in the war on crime 
and our assault on drugs 
facilities like the new 131 million new jail show that tough 
talk is simply not enough if youre going to be tough on crime 
youve got to be tough on criminals he said 
bush then headed to address a luncheon gathering of the 
republican governors association and later was to speak at a 
dinner of the california chamber of commerce 
delving into a complex matter that is the republican partys top 
1990 political goal bush called wednesday for a fair 
reapportionment of congressional districts after the 1990 census 
speaking at a san francisco fundraiser for gop sen pete 
wilson who is running for governor of california the president 
also praised the moves toward democracy in many countries saying 
many of our prayers seem to be answered from moscow to managua 
change is in the air 
the world has undergone another upheaval but this time there 
is no war said bush who spoke by telephone with soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev earlier wednesday in what was believed to be 
only their third telephone conversation 
in the revolution of 89 an idea overcame armies and tanks 
and that idea is democracy bush said 
during his fourday swing through california bush also is 
focusing on crime and drugs the environment and economics and 
trade 
making californias reapportionment fair to the gop bush said 
will require electing wilson governor so he can block the 
democraticcontrolled state legislature from repeating the district 
boundary map it drew in the early 1980s 
this is bigger than party politics bush said at the wilson 
fundraiser in san francisco before he flew to los angeles 
wednesday night gerrymandering violates the spirit of one man 
one vote 
the president said that in the 1981 california redistricting 
lines were drawn crazy twisted lines that cut across 
communities towns and even streets without the slightest regard 
for the will of the people 
bush promised republicans do not seek revenge we dont seek 
a gerrymander of our own 
the census could give california about six additional seats in 
congress based on its population growth 
reapportionment is of vital importance to both parties and the 
avowed top 1990 election goal of republican national committee 
chairman lee atwater but surveys so far show that voters have 
little interest in the issue 
bush gave an upbeat characterization of his conversation with 
gorbachev vowing to continue such consultations to discuss 
differences 
reason and calmness have replaced rhetoric he said 
on friday bush heads to palm springs where he will meet with 
japans prime minister toshiki kaifu on another matter of keen 
interest to californians fair trade 
wilson has no primary opponent of note and through 1989 amassed 
825 million for his campaign compared with 46 million raised 
by state attorney gen john van de kamp and 229 million by former 
san francisco mayor dianne feinstein the two democrats vying to 
run against wilson 
bush called wilson a champion for crime victims the 
environment and a sound economy 
while lauding wilsons record on protecting wilderness and 
wildlife preserves bush did not mention the prickly issue of 
offshore oil on which he and wilson differ bush a onetime texas 
oilman who generally is sympathetic to the industry view is

personal income rose 08 percent in january 
despite a new tax bite from social security the government said 
thursday the report also showed consumer spending climbed a 
narrower 06 percent a pace which analysts attributed to caution 
in the face of mounting inflation 
the commerce department said personal income ran at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 460 trillion last month after gaining 
05 percent in december 
several factors affected the january income increase including 
costofliving increases in social security and other federal 
benefits and a 36 percent pay raise for federal workers 
those increases were offset by an increase in taxes withheld for 
social security as well as a reduction in farm subsidy payments 
excluding these special factors the deparment said personal 
income increased 05 percent the department said 
analysts cited the 11 percent increase in consumer prices in 
january for the slowdown in consumer spending from a 1 percent 
gain in december to 06 percent in january or an annual rate of 
360 trillion 
consumers behaved fairly cautiously in january probably 
because they had to pay so much for energy and food that they 
didnt have that much to spend on other items said michael k 
evans head of evans economics inc 
the labor department said food and energy costs driven up by 
the effects of the fourth coldest december on record accounted for 
60 percent of the jump in the january consumer price index 
once food and energy prices settle down consumer spending 
will pick up evans said 
personal consumption which includes everything except interest 
payments on debt totaled 199 billion down from 367 billion 
in december 
but purchases of durable goods bigticket items expected to 
last more than three years rose 243 billion analysts said this 
spending was spurred in part by automobile sales incentives 
nondurable purchases were up 25 billion while spending on 
services fell 68 billion 
consumer spending is considered a barometer of economic health 
because it represents about twothirds of the nations economic 
activity 
the key component of the income category wages and salaries 
edged up 162 billion in january after gaining 168 billion in 
december 
americans incomes after taxes rose 09 percent the department 
said up from decembers 04 percent gain that category 
incidentally doesnt count social security withholding as a tax 
the department instead treats it as a contribution just as 
it does other retirement program costs 
the personal savings rate as measured against disposable 
income advanced 59 percent compared to a 55 percent rate a month 
earlier

fatima sufarin wept quietly 
thursday as she searched the rubble of what had been her home for 
the past 41 years 
i dont know what im going to do now said mrs sufarin a 
70yearold palestinian who was displaced for the second time in 
her life when soldiers blew up her twostory house wednesday 
the sixroom house was demolished to punish the family for the 
alleged crimes of mrs sufarins 25yearold son imad who is 
accused of throwing a firebomb that wounded an israeli soldier 
family members say imad who is awaiting trial is innocent 
according to the army more than 450 houses have been destroyed 
or sealed in thinistas totaled 300000 
according to ramirez no funds were received from the mexican 
government or the ruling pri party the information obtained by 
us officials indicated the contributions came from the pri the 
initial report of the donation appeared in newsday 
while expressing irritation over the mexican contribution the 
officials said it was not clear whether president carlos salinas de 
gortari was aware of it 
the purported donation which included cash tshirts posters 
and other items was consistent with the support mexico 
historically has provided to the sandinista government 
among hemispheric governments mexico was one of the most 
vigorously opposed to the reagan era policy of supporting the 
nicaraguan contras 
for years radicals within mexicos ruling party have acquiesced 
in the its generally conservative domestic policies but these 
forces have played the dominant role in foreign policy and this 
produced deep mutual mistrust between mexico and the united states 
during the reagan administration 
relations appear to have improved since presidents salinas and 
bush were inaugurated a few weeks apart a little over a year ago 
mexico has found bushs more moderate policies more tolerable 
than reagans while the united states in turn has given salinas 
high marks for his efforts at curbing drug smuggling and in 
restoring the countrys economic health

humorist andy rooney was reinstated today on 
cbs 60 minutes he said hell be on sundays show with a 
commentary on the issues involved in his suspension on feb 8 
im very pleased said rooney whom cbs news president david 
burke had suspended without pay after a gay magazine quoted him as 
saying blacks had watered down their genes a comment rooney 
denies making originally the suspension was to be for three 
months but the lifting of the suspension had been widely expected 
in recent days 
rooney said i think it was a very difficult thing for burke 
to decide to reinstate him early praising the news division 
president burke never has specifically said why he suspended the 
71yearold commentator 
late last year rooney drew fire from gay and lesbian groups for 
saying in a dec 28 cbs special that homosexual unions are 
among things that cause selfinduced deaths 
asked today if he were bitter about his suspension rooney was 
philosophical 
well we all get the bittersweet in our lives he said 
adding that he likes a quotation attributed to abc news anchor sam 
donaldson only the amateurs stay mad 
while not directly criticizing rooneys early reinstatement the 
gay and lesbian alliance against defamation complained that he 
has yet to make amends with the gay and lesbian community 
regarding the series of homophobic comments he made in the last few 
months 
the new yorkbased group had complained to cbs about rooneys 
remark on his december show its statement today also alluded to a 
letter in which rooney said he found the idea of male homosexuality 
repugnant 
the letter was sent to the advocate it appeared along with the 
gay magazines article that had in it the controversial quote 
attributed to rooney 
in a statement announcing rooneys reinstatement burke did not 
say why he had lifted the suspension early after the two met last 
week there were reports that rooney would be back perhaps as early 
as this sunday 
in his statement burke alluded to the controversy over his 
suspension of rooney saying he and rooney had discussed the events 
that led to his suspension as well as the debate that has ensued 
over the past month 
painful though these events have been we have all learned a 
great deal about how sensitive and fragile our society is how 
thoughts and words can be misunderstood how deeply people in 
groups can be hurt if great care is not taken in public discourse 
he said rooney has consistently stated publicly that he is not 
a man who holds prejudice in his heart and mind towards any group 
in our society those of us who know him and work with him know two 
things first that is true and second it is time that andy 
returned to his proper place on 60 minutes 
since his suspension began cbs has gotten more than 5000 calls 
from viewers virtually all supporting him 
during his three weeks away from 60 minutes the program 
while still toprated has slipped in the ratings dropping to 18th 
last sunday when it was beaten by a onetime rerun of abcs hit 
americas funniest home videos 
however research experts at all three networks have discounted 
rooneys absence as a significant factor on the shows ratings drop 
don hewitt executive producer of 60 minutes praised 
burkes decision to put rooney back to work early saying it showed 
burke knows the difference between whats right and whats 
expedient 
rooneys segment on 60 minutes usually runs about three 
minutes hewitt asked how much time he planned to give rooney this 
sunday replied whatever he wants he laughed and added 
what do you say to a 2000pound gorilla

senate leaders and the bush administration 
reached agreement today on a compromise clean air bill providing 
tighter controls on emissions from automobiles electric power 
plants and factories 
republican and democratic leaders as well as the white house 
promised to work for passage of the agreement when the measure 
comes up for debate on the senate floor next week 
the agreement the product of three weeks of closeddoor 
negotiations reflects a middle ground between air pollution 
controls required by a sweeping bill that cleared a senate 
committee last november and the more cautious and less expensive 
approach advocated by the administration 
one aim of the compromise was to defuse the prospect of a 
filibuster which had been threatened by a group of midwest senators 
concerned about the cost of complying with the acid rain provision 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine called it a 
sound and comprehensive proposal and said he hoped it would 
avoid any filibuster 
negotiators hoped the compromise would attract enough support so 
any filibuster attempt would be defeated 
sen bob dole rkan the minority leader said he would work 
to advance the compromise legislation but urged mitchell not to 
handcuff anyone during the upcoming floor action by rushing to 
impose a petition to cut off debate on the matter 
this is a giant step forward dole said of the compromise 
sen robert byrd dwva who has voiced concern about the 
effect of stringent acid rain controls on his states coal miners 
said he would seek additional changes to the bill but he said 
im not going to engage in any filibuster 
one element of the compromise would allow electric utilities in 
the midwest to acquire credits for any pollution reduction these 
credits could be sold to other utilities and in part offset the 
cost of pollution controls 
the breakthrough on the compromise came wednesday when senate 
leaders and the white house agreed to tighter controls on 
automobile emissions to deal with urban smog and on steps aimed at 
easing concerns of the midwest senators over the high costs of 
controlling acid rain pollutants 
president bush traveling in california praised the agreement 
as a big forward step and called on the senate to move quickly 
on it 
the white house during three weeks of closeddoor negotiations 
had adamantly opposed a second round of automobile tailpipe 
controls included in the senate bill at the same time the bills 
key sponsors including mitchell argued that the twostage 
controls were needed to reduce smog in some of nations most 
polluted urban centers 
under a compromise agreement worked out wednesday the second 
round of tailpipe controls known as tier 2 would go into effect 
only if 11 of 27 cities considered to have serious air 
pollution problems fail to make enough progress in meeting federal 
air quality standards by late in this decade 
among the provisions of the compromise 
industrial plants would have to use the best available 
technology to curb releases of 192 toxic chemicals including 
carcinogens and early in the next decade comply with a specific 
health standard to limit risks to people closest to industrial 
plants 
under the acid rain provision electric utility plants will 
have to reduce annual sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons 
some provisons were included to ease midwest concerns about high 
cost of emission controls and concerns from the west that the curbs 
might inhibit growth 
tougher tailpipe emission controls on automobiles would reduce 
smogcausing pollutants by 22 to 60 percent depending on the 
pollutant a second round of emission curbs would go into effect if 
at least a dozen of 27 communities with serious pollution 
problems failed to achieve federal air quality standards 
a broad range of industries and businesses would have to 
comply with tougher controls on smogcausing emissions the 
compromise however would exempt thousands of smaller polluters 
which would have been covered by the original senate bill 
this agreement is environmentally sound and strong said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
he said the provisions will achieve significant and permanent 
reductions in pollutants that cause acid rain will ensure annual 
improvements to bring our nations cities into compliance with 
standards relating to urban smog and carbon monoxide and will 
greatly reduce the risk to the publics health from toxic 
emissions 
by incorporating flexibility and innovation in its approach to 
achieving pollution reductions it will allow environmental and 
health standards to be met in a way that creates maximum choice for 
both states and regulated industries and places fewer burdens on 
consumers it will thus improve the clean air act in a way that 
promotes both a healthy environment and a sound economy 
fitzwater said 
the compromise was criticized by environmentalists 
you could have cities with a total of 80 million people not in 
federal air quality attainment and still not have a tier 2 
said gene karpinski executive director of the us public interest 
research group an environmental group 
the senate leaders and the white house agreed to require utility 
plants to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons a year 
by the end of the decade 
the talks earlier this week produced tentative agreements on how 
to control toxic chemicals from industrial plants and on curbing 
smogcausing pollutants from sources from chemical plants to dry 
cleaners 
a different clean air bill remains in a house committee house 
speaker thomas s foley dwash said wednesday he hoped that bill 
could come up for floor consideration by april several months 
earlier than he previously indicated

easton recalled her childhood in a blue collar foundry town in 
scotland and how her mother instilled in her a love of reading at 
an early age 
when things would get really crazy in the house my mother 
would always pick up a magazine or a book and say just give me 
ten minutes i learned from my mother that books hold a magic a 
way to escape ill always thank her i didnt want to leave school 
and work in a factory my mother gave me the window to the world 
books 
with her mothers encouragement she went on to college and was 
preparing for teaching until her career took a decidedly 
different turn 
robinson who grew up in a family of 10 in a detroit housing 
project credited his father a selftaught reader with only a 
fourthgrade education with instilling in him a love of learning 
and an ambition for better things 
in my particular neighborhood robinson said the odds 
against my making something of my life were enormous

says 
a memo to employees of the corporation wednesday said that 
prosecutors agreed to halt the probe into alleged falsification of 
mx test data the los angeles times reported today 
northrop remains the target other probes including allegations 
of political payoffs in south korea and allegations that it 
defrauded the government by more than 20 billion on the b2 
stealth bomber program the times said northrop had said the fbi 
conducted a raid recently at a northrop b2 parts factory in 
connection with the b2 case 
other investigations of less significant wrongdoing on the b2 
program were dropped as part of the agreement with prosecutors the 
los angeles times reported

joseph hazelwoods apparent efforts to 
pull his grounded tanker off a reef did not do additional damage to 
the crippled ship a former tanker captain testified today 
but robert beevers said that by all normal indications such a 
maneuver would have torn away additional portions of the gashed 
underbelly of the 987foot exxon valdez 
the witness did not explain why the ship suffered no additional 
damage but he said he was certain hazelwood was trying to 
extricate it not stabilize it on the reef 
i have no reason to think that captain hazelwood would lie to 
the coast guard beevers said i dont think he would tell them 
anything he didnt intend to do 
hazelwood in his first radio conversation after the ship hit 
bligh reef said he was trying to extricate it 
under crossexamination by hazelwoods attorneys beevers 
continued to maintain that hazelwood should have remained on the 
bridge of the tanker during its final passage into prince william 
sound 
chunks of glacial ice forced two tankers to change course only a 
few hours before hazelwood tried a similar maneuver last march 24 
still another ship preceded the exxon valdez into prince william 
sound on march 23 without anyone on board certified to pilot in 
that area beevers acknowledged 
on wednesday beevers testimony was stopped by the eruption of 
redoubt volcano 115 miles southwest of anchorage superior court 
judge karl johnstone sent jurors home early to avoid exposure to 
falling ash the first time fallout from the volcano has hit the 
states largest city 
hazelwood 43 was the only skipper whose ship hit bligh reef 
the tanker spilled nearly 11 million gallons of alaska crude 
killing countless birds fish and other wildlife and tarring 
hundreds of miles of rocky shore in the nations worst oil spill 
the seaman from huntington ny is charged with criminal 
mischief reckless endangerment operating a vessel while 
intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil if convicted he could 
get 7 years in prison and 61000 in fines 
before court was recessed wednesday defense attorney dick 
madson had been grilling the retired captain who earlier accused 
hazelwood of reckless actions 
do you recall the course of the arco juneau madson asked 
referring to a tanker that left valdez two hours before the exxon 
ship 
yes said beevers they went around the ice and cleared 
bligh reef 
asked how close the ship came to hitting the reef he referred 
to charts and said about fivetenths of a mile 
madson then elicited the information that the arco juneau was 
traveling at full sea speed of 16 knots or 184 mph while the 
exxon valdez was on maneuvering speed of 124 knots or 143 mph 
in the same area 
i didnt say i approved of what they did beevers 
interjected 
did you consider that masters actions reckless asked 
madson 
yes i would said beevers 
and do you know if he was prosecuted or not asked the 
lawyer 
no i dont said the witness 
outside court defense attorneys said no charges were filed 
against greg knowlton skipper of the arco juneau 
beevers maintained that hazelwood erred when he decided to go 
around the ice and left the ships bridge during the maneuver 
my basic criticism is i thought he made his decision too early 
without carefully evaluating it beevers said other witnesses 
have described ice reports from the arco juneau as guiding 
hazelwoods decision 
the master should be on the bridge beevers insisted 
traditionally that is his duty 
the witness has said hazelwood was particularly reckless because 
at that point he was the only officer on board licensed to pilot 
the ship in prince william sound 
but beevers acknowledged that another ship the brooklyn 
chartered to texaco had entered prince william sound earlier the 
same day with no one aboard holding a pilots license he said he 
assumed the coast guard had waived the requirement that ship 
missed the reef by sixtenths of a mile he said 
beevers also suggested that the exxon valdez with a crew of 19 
may have been understaffed increasing stress on individual members 
that was certainly the smallest crew on a tanker id seen 
he said beevers said the ships he sailed often had a crew of 32 
but by the time he quit in 1987 companies were scaling back to 
save money

prime minister yitzhak shamir under pressure 
from likud bloc hawks on thursday hardened his stance on us 
proposals for convening peace talks with a palestinian delegation 
in an interview with the associated press shamir ruled out 
participation of arabs from east jerusalem in the process and said 
there was no need for two exiled palestinians in a proposed 
10member negotiating team 
who needs them shamir said of a reported compromise 
proposal to include two deported palestinians to meet plo 
conditions that the team include representatives from the nearly 3 
million palestinians who live outside israeliheld territory 
shamir said israels plan to hold palestinian elections was not 
aimed at finding an ultimate solution but an interim selfrule 
scheme for the 17 million arabs in the west bank and gaza strip 
we are not going to solve the problem of the palestinian 
diaspora it is not our task he said 
shamir stressed that 130000 east jerusalem arabs would be 
excluded from the election proposal and from the negotiating team 
that is slated to meet in cairo to plan for the balloting 
its clear that whoever lives in east jerusalem will not be 
able to participate in these negotiations said shamir 
proshamir likud sources who demanded anonymity said shamir had 
dropped earlier caution designed to encourage compromise and avoid 
friction with us secretary of state james a baker iii and labor 
party hawks such as defense minister yitzhak rabin 
they said shamir had adopted a tougher line because of an 
internal revolt against the plan by likud hawks who could attempt 
to oust him 
the hawks mustered 23 of the partys 40 parliament members to 
call for a party meeting before shamir gave his final answer to 
bakers compromise proposals 
shamir said the challenge was not very serious because he 
had support from 80 percent or more of his party 
the great majority of my party supports me without doubt or 
hesitation shamir said vowing to provide the israeli cabinet 
with his final position on bakers proposals in a few days or 
weeks 
shamir in a 30minute interview wedged between meetings with 
party officials lashed out at us officials who said israel 
should not settle soviet immigrants in the predominantly arab 
sector of jerusalem which was captured from jordan in the 1967 
middle east war 
we are very upset by some statements about the immigration of 
soviet jewish people saying that they not be permitted to live in 
east jerusalem he said noting that 100000 israelis already 
lived in the arab sector 
speaking on army radio deputy foreign minister benjamin 
netanyahu of shamirs likud bloc said us officials told him in 
washington this week that settling soviet immigrants in east 
jerusalem was improper 
netanyahu said such statements raised questions about whether 
a framework exists today to continue the peace process 
these things raise doubts regarding the basis of understanding 
with the americans he said 
shamir and netanyahu spoke before baker announced in washington 
that the bush administration would consider cuts in israels 3 
billion annual aid if the overall foreign aid program had to be cut 
to provide funds for new crisis areas 
shamir spokesman avi pazner had no immediate comment but the 
announcement was likely to be viewed here as a form of pressure on 
shamir to accept the us proposals 
shamir is also under pressure from the rival labor party to make 
a decision by march 7 on whether to accept us proposals for 
starting talks 
party leaders reiterated they expected shamir to make a final 
decision soon on whether to hold a dialogue with palestinians in 
cairo 
yaakov tzur labors health minister said on army radio the 
time has come to make a clear decision seven months have passed 
the americans and egyptians have made proposals and we have to 
honor them without hestiations and go on he said 
vice premier shimon peres the labor leader said in an earlier 
interview he doubted shamir could accept the baker proposals and 
suggested he might try to form a laborled government if shamir 
failed to respond positively

federal officials arent getting many 
takers for the disaster loans they brought to mccaysville after a 
devastating flood leading one merchant to say with dread this 
might be a ghost town 
everybodys leaving nobodys rebuilding said the merchant 
william jabaley whose family has owned the towns only department 
store since 1921 
government spokesman guido pettinelli said merchants are taking 
a poor attitude in refusing the lowinterest loans the 
merchants already suffering hard times before the flood say they 
couldnt make the payments 
midfebruary flooding caused damage estimated at more than 55 
million in fannin county which includes mccaysville and 53 
million in polk county tenn which includes mccaysvilles 
neighbor copperhill 
the floods came during two weeks of tornadoes and other storms 
that prompted president bush to declare disaster areas in 13 
counties in georgia 24 in alabama and two in tennessee 
mccaysville and copperhill especially suffered because they 
already had severe economic problems the two towns have one 
industry tennessee chemical co a copper mining company that 
once employed more than 2000 residents but now only 400 
in mccaysville a town of about 400 phe month because of differences 
in salesreporting calendars 
jeffrey feiner an analyst at merrill lynch amp co inc said 
we remain somewhat cautious given continuing high consumer debt 
levels and sluggish trends in the financial and real estate markets 
retailers could have a tough time this year coping with the 
effects of what have been dubbed rolling recessions which are 
rippling through parts of the manufacturing sector such as the 
automobile industry 
a widely watched barometer of manufacturing health showed a 10th 
straight monthly decline in the sector during february the 
national association of purchasing managements index stood at 483 
percent in february up from 452 percent in january a reading 
below 50 indicates that the us manufacturing economy is generally 
declining 
monroe greenstein of bear stearns amp co inc said retailers 
probably will have a mediocre year in 1990 similar to 1989 
february marks the start of the fiscal year for many retailers 
analysts were reluctant to attach too much significance to the 
results because february is typically a slow time for business in 
the retail trade january and february are transition months as 
winter merchandise is cleared out to make room for fresh spring 
lines 
in contrast to the chains that did well last month sears 
roebuck and co the countrys biggest retailer continued to 
struggle 
the giant chicagobased general merchant which began a new 
merchandising strategy a year ago hoping to reverse years of 
marketshare losses had a hohum february sales were virtually 
flat at 2127 billion in the four weeks ended feb 24 vs 2126 
billion a year earlier 
sales at sears stores open a year or longer edged up only 15 
percent 
retailers and industry analysts prefer to focus on sales 
comparisons for stores operating at least a year called samestore 
or comparablestore results newly opened stores typically enjoy a 
period of unusually brisk business that isnt sustained over time 
one standout among the retailers reporting thursday was walmart 
stores inc the big bentonville arkbased discount chain said its 
february sales surged 33 percent to 195 billion from 147 
billion a year earlier sales at walmarts open a year or longer 
posted a healthy 17 percent gain 
by either measure walmart consistently has been a star 
performer as it expands across the country 
currently ranked no 3 there is widespread speculation in the 
industry that walmart this year could overtake sears and k mart 
corp in merchandise sales volume in the united states 
k mart based in troy mich recently stepped up efforts to 
respond to the challengein a bid to boost sales and profit k mart 
will accelerate its store opening and renovation program taking a 
422 million aftertax charge to carry out the plan 
k marts report on last months sales will be released march 8 
many of the retailers who in recent years have reported their 
monthly results on the first thursday of every month will be 
reporting later in march there is an effort being made within the 
industry to reach a compromise on a single monthly reporting date 
here are some reports released thursday 
dallasbased department store operator jc penney co inc said 
sales at its stores and through its catalogs rose 81 percent in 
february to 880 million from 814 million a year earlier sales at 
stores open for at least a year were up 72 percent 
melville corp the harrison nybased owner of offprice and 
other retailers said february sales rose 117 percent to 5032 
million from a year earliers 4506 million 
montgomery ward amp co based in chicago reported a 25 percent 
february sales gain to 299 million from 2918 million last 
years figures were restated to exclude discontinued lines 
woolworth corp the new yorkbased parent of numerous specialty 
stores including the foot locker sports shoe chain said its 
domestic february sales jumped 137 percent to 330 million from 
291 million samestore sales rose 117 percent

the internal revenue service said thursday it 
has not decided whether to appeal a tax court decision that 
overturned a 6095 million irs ruling against the estate of 
publisher samuel i newhouse 
the court in a decision published thursday sided with the 
estate on the only issue in one of the biggest tax disputes in the 
nations history the value of newhouses stock in the familys 
publishing and broadcasting operations at the time of his death in 
1979 
the irs had contended that newhouses holdings in advance 
publications inc and newhouse broadcasting co were worth a 
combined 132 billion the estate whose executors are his sons 
samuel i newhouse jr and donald e newhouse inisted the value 
was 2471 million 
after weighing weeks of testimony from both sides judge john 
williams jr discounted the value of the stock to 2356 mllion 
the experts whose opinions were wellreasoned disagreed about 
almost every issue and we find that a willing buyer would have 
been uncertain about the rights and privileges of advance 
common stock he wrote 
that uncertainty coupled with restrictions in advances 
corporate charter that barred an outsider from controlling the 
company would depress the stock price the court reasoned 
irs spokesman steve pyrek said agency lawyers are reviewing 
williams 100page opinion before deciding whether to appeal 
the irs wanted to value newhouses stock as if the components of 
the publishing and broadcasting operations were being sold 
separately the estate argued that was not realistic because of 
restrictions in the corporate charters that severely limited 
opportunities for breaking up the companies 
williams based his decision in part on a report by goldman sachs 
amp co an investment banking firm on the value of advance 
goldman sachs concluded that only another media company would 
be interested in acquiring advance and that none of the major media 
companies would have considered buying the common stock by far the 
largest portion of the estate without first eliminating the claims 
of the preferred shareholders williams wrote 
he held that goldman sachs was correct in devaluing the advance 
stock by 35 percent because of the lack of marketability of the 
stock and the prohibitions against outside control 
under advances charter owners of class a voting common stock 
have exclusive rights to elect the board of directors class a and 
b nonvoting commonstock owners vote on any merger holders of 
preferred stock have the upper hand on any liquidation and owners 
of all three classes of stock participate in dividends 
at the time he died in 1979 the elder newhouse owned all the 
outstanding shares of class a and b common stock in advance other 
family members owned all the preferred shares 
media baron rupert murdoch testifying for the newhouse estate 
said he would have found advance an unattractive purchase because 
of the difficulty in gaining control of the company and because of 
federal limitations on media ownership 
douglas mccorkindale vice chairman of gannett corp said 
gannett would not be interested in advance common stock unless the 
preferred shares also were for sale 
even in the absence of restrictions on control williams wrote 
the sheer size of advance meant that the sale of all of advances 
newspaper and magazine properties at one time would have had a 
seriously depressing effect on the market for such properties 
the irs earlier had dropped an effort to add a 3048 million 
fraud penalty to the assessment which would have pushed the total 
at issue to more than 914 million 
newhouses media empire was launched in 1922 when he and an 
associate bought control of the staten island ny advance at 
the time of newhouses death advance was the nations fourth 
largest newspapermagazine publisher with 50 newspapers in 22 
markets and the conde nast publications including vogue glamour 
and house amp garden 
newhouse broadcasting operates stations cable systems and 
microwave facilities in several states

democrats said thursday that a conservative 
nominee to head 70 million in juvenile justice programs lacked 
experience and they questioned his ties to the moral majority 
republicans declared he was fully qualified 
i am troubled that an individual apparently without the 
requisite credentials would be nominated for this important 
position said sen edward m kennedy dmass the stakes are 
high if we are determined to protect our youth from becoming 
involved with drugs and crime 
the criticism came as the senate judiciary committee took up the 
nomination of republican education adviser robert sweet as 
administrator of the office of juvenile justice and deliquency 
prevention 
the office distributes millions of dollars in federal grants to 
state and local agencies to combat juvenile deliquency 
sweet received a cool reception from democrats who indicated he 
could have a tough time winning confirmation 
the former white house adviser and onetime head of the new 
hampshire moral majority has drawn critics ranging from the 
national parentteacher association to people for the american way 
a liberal washington group 
some of the antagonism appears to be an outgrowth of fierce 
political infighting at the department of education while sweet was 
an aide there in the early 1980s former education secretary terrel 
bell was highly critical of sweet in his memoirs the thirteenth 
man 
sweet supporters range from the boys clubs of america to sen 
gordon humphrey rnh who has been pointing out that many 
opponents are financial beneficiaries of the governments junvenile 
justice programs 
its understandable may i observe that the grantees would 
like one of their own to be head of this office but that may not 
be such a good idea from the standpoint of prudence humphrey 
told the committee 
the 52yearold sweet a former high school teacher and textbook 
salesman told the panel that he had devoted his entire career to 
helping young people and that his education background should 
fulfill a law that requires a juvenile justice administrator with 
experience in the juvenile justice field 
i want to be an advocate of helping young people have a better 
shot at life than they otherwise would have sweet said he said 
he has been studying juvenile justice issues and would be able to 
quickly grasp details of the job 
some republicans were quick to back the nominee i believe 
that bob sweet is fully qualified for this position said sen 
orrin hatch rutah i know him personally and i support him 
sen arlen specter rpa however asked the nominee for 
written answers to a number of questions about juvenile justice 
issues 
sen paul simon dill asked sweet if he had ever joined an 
organization such as the national association for the advancement 
of colored people that would have given him experience with 
minority youth sweet said he had not and that he was not much of 
an association person

the case against manuel noriega is so closely 
linked to fidel castro that it should be moved out of militantly 
anticommunist south florida a codefendants attorney said in a 
motion filed thursday 
samuel burstyn an attorney for former panamanian army lt col 
luis del cid said the us district court trial should be moved to 
san francisco new york or puerto rico 
such motions are rarely granted and judges normally attempt to 
seat a jury before ruling on a changeofvenue motion 
burstyn said castro was an unindicted coconspirator in the 
february 1988 drugtrafficking indictment against the ousted 
panamanian dictator he said the cuban leader mediated a dispute 
between noriega and colombias medellin drug cartel after a raid on 
a cocaine laboratory that noriega was supposedly bribed to protect 
the us government has already made plain its intention 
to poison the well by emphasizing the role of communist cuba in the 
principal conspiracy charges in this case burstyn said in the 
motion before judge william hoeveler 
burstyn said that during del cids unsuccessful attempt to get 
bond prosecutors released a photo of del cid noriega and castro 
meeting in cuba 
even if an entirely nonlatin jury was seated the pressure 
on the jury in effect to convict fidel castro will be 
enormous the motion said 
burstyn said south florida is dominated by cubans 
nicaraguans and exiles from other central american fleeing 
communist dictatorships 
del cid who was indicted for allegedly handling a drug payoff 
for noriega is attempting to negotiate a plea bargain in return 
for cooperating against noriega 
burstyn said talks with prosecutors were continuing but no 
agreement has been reached 
the judge has targeted late november for the trial but says it 
would begin by january many attorneys citing the complexity of 
handling classified documents before and during the trial say it 
could be mid1991 before jury selection begins

higher prices and mortgage rates dampened the 
ability of the typical american family to buy a house in january a 
real estate trade group said thursday 
the increase in mortgage rates should be temporary we expect 
lower rates this spring john a tuccillo chief economist for 
the national association of realtors said 
this should improve overall affordability conditions in 1990 
especially in areas where there is an ample supply of moderately 
priced homes he added 
the realtors said their affordability index fell to 1042 in 
january meaning that a family earning the national median income 
of 33708 had 1042 percent of the income needed to qualify for a 
median priced home costing 96200 
the median means that half of the families earn more and half 
less or that half of the houses sell for more and half for less 
the median income was up 108 from 33600 in december while 
the median price rose 3700 from 92500 a month earlier the 
income needed to qualify for a loan on the typical home rose 1298 
from 31066 in december 
interest rates meanwhile rose from 996 percent in december to 
998 in january the association uses a composite rate reflecting 
both fixedrate and adjustablerate mortgages 
the changes meant a 27 increase to 674 in the monthly mortgage 
payment which represents 24 percent of the median familys income 
the index was down from 1082 in december the highest level 
since it measured 1105 in january 1989 
despite the january decline in overall affordability 
conditions the index is over 1000 which is considered to be a 
good range said realtors president norman d flynn 
however with the median home price and the average mortgage 
rate increasing naturally we will see some people squeezed out of 
the housing market he added 
the realtors said last month that typical firsttime buyers 
already were unable to enter the starterhome market during the 
fourth quarter of 1989 
the affordability index for them was only 744 it was 71 in 
both the second and third quarters of 1989

said thursday he would abide by a court order not to contact the 
child he tracked across two continents during a fierce custody 
dispute 
a court issued the temporary order pending a ruling on whether 
dr erich foretich can see his 7yearold daughter for the first 
time in two years a date has not been set for the family court 
ruling 
hilarys mother dr elizabeth morgan went to jail for 25 
months rather than reveal the whereabouts of her daughter whom she 
said was sexually abused by foretich 
in washington thursday a court ruled that morgan can have her 
passport back so she can go to new zealand however the passport 
is in the possession of the citys court of appeals and judge 
herbert dixon of district of columbia superior court said he could 
not order that court to return the document a decision by the 
appeals court was expected later 
hilary has spent the last two years with her maternal 
grandparents in new zealand during foretichs search 
foretich a 45yearold dentist from falls church va said 
thursday he would abide by the temporary family court order not to 
contact his child 
asked at christchurch airport how he tracked his daughter 
foretich said he did it with the help of police departments and 
private dectives who were able to do these things 
he said he hoped to see his daughter soon and spent the day 
consulting with his lawyers 
william morgan foretichs fatherinlaw has vowed to call 
police if foretich approaches the child 
the reason were staying in auckland as opposed to here is to 
keep some privacy in my daughters life foretich said at the 
airport thats most important paramount to me 
he also said he was certain the new zealand judicial system 
would rule in his favor 
dixon ordered morgan to jail for contempt of court in august 
1986 for refusing to allow foretich to visit the girl morgan was 
released three days later by the appeals court which required her 
to surrender the deed to her house as bond and turn over her 
passport 
in february 1987 dixon sent her to jail again but she was 
released three days later after agreeing to allow foretichs visits 
in august 1987 dixon jailed morgan for a third time she 
remained imprisoned until september 1989 
in his order thursday dixon noted morgan remained in contempt 
of court

problem in my opinion he said and that applies to any woman 
who has a desire to be with another woman

senate leaders and president bush compromised 
thursday on future air pollution controls for automobiles 
factories and electric power plants enhancing chances that a clean 
air bill will pass this year 
the agreement after more than three weeks of closeddoor 
negotiations was viewed as a middle ground likely to attract 
enough support to thwart continuing regional opposition in the 
looming senate debate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine called the compromise 
a sound and comprehensive agreement that will substantially 
improve air quality over the next decade he planned to bring the 
legislation to the senate floor up on monday 
president bush is extraordinarily pleased with the agreement 
it is a milestone an enormous step forward said roger porter 
the presidents chief domestic policy adviser 
porter said the administration would attempt to expedite senate 
passage and seek a similar agreement in the house where cleanair 
legislation remains in committee 
but the compromise is still likely to encounter stiff industry 
lobbying largely because of its estimated 20 billion to 40 
billion annual cost to the economy 
some senators also have expressed concern that the bargaining 
weakened provisions in the original senate bill that would have 
required stronger automobile emission controls to combat urban 
smog other have voiced continued concern about the impact of acid 
rain controls 
sen bob dole rkan the minority leader called the 
compromise a giant step forward in revising federal air 
pollution laws for the first time in 13 years but he cautioned 
that many senators likely will seek changes when the measure goes 
to the senate floor 
he urged mitchell not to handcuff anyone during the floor 
action by rushing to cut off debate 
the agreement made some accommodations to regional interests 
especially those concerned about the local economic cost of acid 
rain controls 
on that score the compromise continues to require a 10 million 
ton annual reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions but allows 
midwest utilities to achieve special credits that could be sold to 
other utilities to recoup some of the costs plants that use new 
technology instead of switching away from highsulfur coal to 
another fuel would receive additional credits for early cuts in 
emissions a provision designed to help west virginias coal 
industry 
about a dozen senators from the midwest had threatened to 
filibuster the legislation if some accommodation were not met to 
ease their concerns about the high costs of the pollution controls 
mitchell said he still could not discount the threat of a 
filibuster but various senate sources suggested that with the 
compromise mitchell likely would have enough votes to halt debate 
sen robert byrd dwva said he would seek additional changes 
to the bill but im not going to engage in any filibuster he 
said 
the breakthrough on the legislation came wednesday when leaders 
agreed on pollution curbs on automobiles 
the compromise eliminates an automatic second round of auto 
tailpipe controls although such measures could be put into effect 
if more than 11 of 27 cities with serious ozone pollution 
problems fail to meet federal air quality standards at the end of 
this decade 
the white house had strongly opposed the second round of 
controls as had the auto industry but environmentalists state 
pollution control officials in areas with the dirtiest air and 
some senators argued the second round of controls are needed to 
deal with smog in such areas as southern california and the 
northeast 
in the final days of negotiations an agreement also came on the 
acid rain provision after senators from the west were assured that 
the utility emission controls would allow for future growth in 
electric capacity and some accommodation was made to the midwest 
region 
earlier tentative agreements were struck on how to curb toxic 
and smogcausing emissions from industrial plants 
under the compromise industrial plants will have to use the 
best available technology to curb releases of 192 toxic chemicals 
including carcinogens or cancercausing agents early in the next 
decade a health standard that would require plants to reduce 
emissions further if the cancer risk to nearby residents is still 
too high 
a broad range of industries and businesses also would have to 
comply with tougher controls on smogcausing emissions the

prime minister margaret thatcher faced a crisis 
thursday after the resignation of 18 local councilors over her 
property tax reform 
aimed at bringing home the costs of socalistrun local 
administrations the poll tax has backfired in mrs thatchers 
own conservative party heartlands and she is getting the blame 
in irate exchanges in the house of commons on thursday 
socialist labor party legislators said mrs thatcher is running 
out of both friends and excuses she retorted the new tax was a 
very much fairer system 
but rankandfile legislators acknowledged the party is in deep 
trouble over the tax known officially as the community charge and 
warned it could cost the next election in 1991 or 1992 
mrs thatchers embattled environment secretary chris patten in 
charge of the tax said authorities were setting an average charge 
of around 620 a person sharply higher than the 473 government 
target 
accusing councils of cynically using the new system as an excuse 
to build up reserves while blaming the government for the high 
charges patten said nothing could justify behavior like this 
on wednesday night 18 of the 25 conservative party councilors 
on the west oxford district council resigned from the party to 
become independents the conservatives automatically lost control 
of the traditional tory area near the university city 
the rebels complained that after years of following mrs 
thatchers strictures on thrift they were forced to set a poll tax 
of 700 a person instead of a planned 430 the tax starts this 
fiscal year 
this came as the final straw said council chairman margaret 
frost we are people who have been on the political scene for 
some time hardworking going along with policies trying to make 
them work when they patently arent working 
the new tax replaces a single property tax levied on the owner 
of a house or apartment on the basis of the value of the property 
the poll tax is payable by each adult and will bear heaviest 
on bigger households while people living alone will be the main 
beneficiaries 
for example a couple jointly owning a fourbedroomed row house 
in the laborcontrolled north london borough of camden who now pay 
1336 a year total will pay 1002 each in poll tax 
mrs thatchers aim is to make every voter pay local taxes and 
she hoped reject highspending laborcontrolled local authorities 
but instead big bills are also rolling in from tory authorities 
in wealthy districts across the country mrs thatcher is now 
threatening to use central government powers to limit the size of 
the charges a council can set 
the last of the 39 county councils in england announced its 
charges wednesday night amid some angry scenes in city halls 
hundreds of smaller district councils have to announce their 
charges by march 18 
protesters chanting cant pay wont pay disrupted the 
meeting of the conservativeled somerset county council in 
southwest england somerset set the tax at 626 a person to help 
fund a 4175 million budget up 113 percent up on last year 
at greenwich an east london borough demonstrators threw flour 
bombs at conservative councilors and in manchester police were 
called to guard the council chamber 
local councils get more than half their funds in direct grants 
from central government they are responsible for services ranging 
from schools the fire department and the local police force to 
garbage collection 
patten said councils had inceased spending by 5 billion this 
year the equivalent of a 35 percent increase in the old property 
tax 
however local politicians say the higherthanexpected levies 
are partly because of reductions in central government grants and 
high wage demands have forced spending increases 
the poll tax is named after a 14th century tax imposed 
imposed on a voteless populace which triggered a peasants revolt 
in 1380 
the government is already unpopular with record interest rates 
running at 15 percent while inflation remains high at nearly 8 
percent 
a harris poll in londons sunday times this week gave labor 51 
percent of the vote a 17 point lead and the socialists most 
commanding position since mrs thatcher won power in 1979

southeast of mexico city and confiscated 22 pounds of cocaine 
six automatic rifles and several rounds of ammunition antelmo said 
in an interview 
he said there were no immediate plans to extradite aldana to los 
angeles where he faces charges in the 1985 slaying of enrique 
camarena salazar a us drug enforcement administration agent 
aldana was one of five people indicted in january by a federal 
grand jury on charges of participating in the murder of camarena 
and his mexican pilot alfredo zavala avelar their bodies were 
found in march 1985 on a ranch 65 miles southeast of guadalajara 
camarena had been tortured 
camarena had led a series of raids on marijuana plantations 
allegedly operated by rafael caro quintero who is serving a 
40year sentence for the murder and 31 more years for drug 
trafficking 
at the time of the murder aldana was head of the mexican branch 
of the international law enforcement agency interpol

the weekly magazine proceso said a drug defendant had testified 
that a shipment of colombian cocaine seized at the mexico city 
airport was for aldana 
the defendant later recanted claiming his testimony was made 
under duress 
since then aldana has been a practicing lawyer in mexico city 
the attorney generals office did not explain why it had not 
arrested aldana earlier 
the los angeles indictment charged aldana participated in the 
killing of camarena to protect a guadalajara cocaine and marijuana 
cartel according to the us justice department 
a dozen people have been convicted in the murder aldana was 
among 19 people named in indictments returned since the original 
also named were juan ramon matta ballesteros whose extradition 
to the united states on separate charges sparked deadly riots in 
honduras in 1988 and manuel ibarra herrera the former head of the 
mexican federal judicial police the equivalent of the fbi

a former cuban political prisoner who heads the 
us delegation to the un human rights commission attacked cuba 
on thursday as one of the worlds worst human rights violators 
but the delegate armando valladares also said the united 
states was abandoning its bid to have cuba placed under special 
scrutiny by the un human rights commission 
villadares said the united states has submitted a more moderate 
draft resolution on cuba in place of a strongly worded text that 
failed to win support last year from a majority of the 43 nations 
represented on the rights commission 
valladares who spent time in cuban leader fidel castros jails 
before coming to the united states said the new us draft does 
not condemn cuba even though the communist government is one of 
the worlds worst offenders on human rights 
cuba recently has intensified its repressive policies 
valladares said 
the new us draft resolution focuses on reports that cuban 
authorities have taken reprisals against cubans who testified 
before representatives of the un rights commission on its 
firstever factfinding mission to cuba in 1988 
the proposed resolution expresses great concern about these 
reports and calls on cuban authorities to honor their guarantees 
not to take action against cuban witnesses 
the us draft also urges un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar to provide the commission with complete records of his 
contacts with cuban authorities on human rights issues 
our resolution is not based on any feelings of vengeance 
villadares said 
we are not obsessed with cuba we would like to have the case 
of cuba be dealt with as that of any other country he added 
ambassador morris b abram the head of the us mission to the 
united nations in geneva said the us draft had a great deal of 
support among commission members 
but sources in western delegations speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the latest us proposal has little chance of 
winning approval from the commission which is dominated by third 
world members 
last year the commission rejected a us proposal calling for a 
new factfinding mission to cuba the 1988 visit resulted in a 
lengthy but noncommittal report which listed numerous allegations 
of human rights violations as well as denials by the havana 
government 
in january abram indicated that washington was still seeking 
special measures to monitor the human rights situation in cuba 
at the time he said evenhandedness requires that cubas 
welldocumented human rights abuses be given the same attention as 
that in guatemala chile and el salvador which all have been 
examined by special commissionappointed investigators 
villadares remarks indicated the united states was abandoning 
that position 
while the us has offered a more moderate proposal there still 
have been heated exchanges between the us and cuban delegations 
at commission meetings 
cuban deputy foreign minister raul roa kouri accused us 
authorities of trampling upon the rights of millions of us 
citizens and persecuting human rights activists 
cuban delegates attacked valladares as a 
counterrevolutionary who was boring the commission with his 
statements

east germany took the first step thursday 
toward privatizing state industries but set conditions that prevent 
a wholesale selloff of major assets apparently to prevent a buyout 
by west germans 
also thursday the foreign ministry called on west germany to 
start talks to coordinate a common german position to present at 
the twoplusfour conference later this year to steer a course 
for unification 
a ministry statement carried by the east german news agency 
adn said east germany recommends that the germanys neighbor 
states should be invited to take part in the talks although 
without specifying in what capacity 
as of now other participants in the talks will be the world war 
ii allies the united states britain france and the soviet union 
poland has been asking to participate it is worried by west 
german chancellor helmut kohls refusal to give unconditional 
guarantees that a united germany would not claim territory ceded to 
poland at the end of world war ii 
in another political development the parliament said thursday 
that 35 political parties have registered to run candidates in the 
march 18 elections although no candidate lists have been made 
public yet 
according to plans set out thursday by the interim government of 
communist premier hans modrow massive factories run by the state 
are to be offered to east german investors on march 15 although 
land and fixed assets will be prohibited from outright sale to 
foreign buyers 
the communistled government repeatedly has expressed its fear 
of being bought out by the wealthy west germans 
the conversion to a more westernstyle of industrial management 
is set to begin only three days before the elections and the 
parliament to be seated by that vote could choose to revise the 
plans 
the privatization plan addresses some of the concerns of west 
germans seeking to merge the two economies although it stops short 
of the fullscale conversion to market principles sought by west 
german industrialists 
economic reform commissioner wolfgang krause said the assets to 
remain in public ownership would be under control of the 
parliament which could make exceptions to the sales restrictions 
he said other details of the conversion remained to be settled 
by the newly elected government 
government spokesman wolfgang meyer said the interim step toward 
privatization would give industry managers more autonomy while 
hindering arbitrary sale of assets and property 
east germanys economy has ground to a halt in recent weeks as 
the nation awaits the outcome of its first democratic balloting 
the lack of detail offered on the privatization plan likely 
reflects the interim leaders reluctance to make major changes 
without a public mandate 
parliament secretariat chief herbert kelle told the communist 
party newspaper neues deutschland that 35 parties have registered 
for the elections hansandreas schoenfeldt spokesman for the 
election commission said a final list of parties and candidates 
would not be released until march 9 
three minor parties were rejected because they failed to fulfill 
requirements that they present a platform and a list of party 
leaders neues deutschland quoted kelle as saying 
schoenfeldt said he thought moves to postpone the vote by the 
german social union a member party of the alliance for germany 
would be unsuccessful 
he said east germany has no institution that could rule on the 
partys petition to postpone the vote and allow small parties more 
time to prepare their campaigns 
meanwhile west germanys masscirculation bild newspaper 
reported that east german and west german finance officials have 
agreed to a currency union by july 1 
the report to appear in fridays edition said officials in a 
joint currency commission decided that east german citizens 
savings would be exchanged over a period of time at a onetoone 
rate 
only savings deposited in east german bank accounts before jan 
1 or possibly before last nov 9 when the berlin wall was thrown 
open would be converted the newspaper said 
the paper said cash up to 1000 marks could probably be 
exchanged at parity amounts over 1000 marks would be cashed at a 
less favorable rate 
the east german government declined to comment on the report 
and west german government spokesman dieter vogel last week denied 
that any decisions have been made

pesticide companies would be banned from 
exporting agricultural chemicals that cant be used in the united 
states if legislation introduced thursday in the house and senate 
becomes law 
its the broadest swipe at the pesticide industry by congress 
since use of chemicals in farming became a high profile food safety 
concern 
if the epa says it is too hazardous to be used on us grown 
foods then it is too hazardous to be used on foreign grown 
foods said sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate 
agriculture committee 
he said a loophole in the law allows us chemical companies to 
manufacture here and ship overseas pesticides considered probable 
carcinogens 
fda testing has discovered these banned and unregistered 
pesticides in foreign food imported to the united states 
completing what many call the circle of poison said leahy 
leahy and sen al gore dtenn cosponsored the measure in the 
senate and reps mike synar dokla leon panetta dcalif and 
dan glickman dkan are sponsoring it in the house 
gore said that among the chemicals that would have to stop 
production in the united states are chlordane and heptachlor which 
are made only in his home state by the velsicol chemical corp of 
memphis 
these chemicals are killers we know that said gore 
velsicol has the same responsiblity of every manufacturer to act 
in a responsible way and to protect public health 
gore said he is cosponsoring the bill because one of the 
leading offenders is in my home state and he is concerned about 
the safety of his constituents who could be eating imported foods 
grown with cancercausing chemicals 
donna jennings a spokeswoman for velsicol said chlordane and 
heptachlor are temporarily off the us market because they are 
still under review by the environmental protection agency 
she said the products are used to kill termites and protect 
germinating seeds from other pests while alternative chemicals 
exist for use in the united states there are some regions of the 
world like the tropics where weather and pest conditions prevent 
other products from being effective she said 
i dont think us regulators should make decisions for other 
countries about what they do and do not need said jennings 
in addition to health concerns glickman offered a pure business 
reason why the chemicals should be kept away from foreign countries 
continued foreign use of epabanned pesticides gives foreign 
farmers a competitive advantage over american farmers who produce 
their crops in a safe and healthful way these chemicals increase 
crop yields said glickman who serves on the house agriculture 
committee 
national agricultural chemicals association president jay vroom 
however said the bill would hurt business for us chemical 
manufacturers 
a unilateral approach to a global issue does no good and only 
puts us manufacturers at a disadvantage and may drive importing 
countries to suppliers that may supply far less environmental 
stewardship with their products he said

a leading federal drug agent who resigned this 
week says the nations multibilliondollar drug war is being 
compromised by inexperienced leaders and a politically fueled 
demand for quick success 
robert stutman until wednesday chief of the new york office of 
the drug enforcement administration maintained in an interview 
that efforts to stem drug smuggling a focus of the drug war are 
virtually futile 
in unusual remarks for a prominent law enforcement official 
stutman said the bush administration has overemphasized the role of 
law enforcement in fighting drugs he urged greater attention to 
education and treatment 
for too long american policymakers and others have depended 
on people who carry a badge to solve the problem and its not 
going to happen that way stutman said the problem is we 
continue to try to sell the american public on shortterm answers 
and thats what law enforcement is 
stutman 46 a 25year dea veteran said he believed that 
inexperience in the federal office of national drug control policy 
led by former education secretary william j bennett was 
contributing to the policy flaws 
im not sure the people who are presently setting policy have 
the experience level and are dealing enough with whats happened in 
the past he said one of the attitudes i saw in bennetts 
office was we dont want to even hear what happened in the past 
because thats all been a failure 
the result he suggested is repetition of failure for example 
he said when bennett last year proposed a drive to clean up drugs 
in washington dc dea officials privately derided the project as 
odale revisited after a failed 1972 streetlevel drugfighting 
program the office of drug abuse law enforcement 
fred la sor a spokesman for bennetts office disagreed with 
stutmans suggestion that its leaders had been ignoring the 
expertise of others 
more broadly he said we have to do what we have to do 
congress is asking for results the white house is asking for 
results the american public is asking for results were going 
after results and i think were getting some 
la sor said the yearold drug policy office was focusing in 
part on interdiction because the us government handles that work 
alone while state local and private programs share treatment and 
education efforts 
stutman however argued that interdiction is essentially 
ineffective he noted that the seizure of 43 tons of cocaine 
between oct 1 and nov 15 had no impact on the drugs price and 
availability and in the 1970s when federal agents staunched the 
supply of turkish heroin mexican heroin promptly took its place 
he said 
i would have thought we could have learned from that 
mistake stutman said in the interview tuesday and yet we are 
continuing to depend on a drugspecific policy that says 
lets stop cocaine from colombia peru and bolivia 
my argument is its almost an impossible situation he said 
does it deserve attention absolutely but that isnt where we 
should be putting our emphasis our leadership and our money which 
are clearly much more needed in the prevention area 
stutman who led the new york dea office for nearly five years 
quit to join stutman tankel strang and hayes a firm that advises 
corporations on antidrug strategies for their work forces he also 
is cowriting a book and is a drug consultant for cbs news

a legislator took his power to the people 
with a there ought to be a law contest and received suggestions 
such as banning kissing in cars and requiring people to use common 
sense 
state rep larry wennlund selected the two winners thursday and 
said he will introduce the ideas this spring during the illinois 
general assembly session 
the winner in the under18yearold category was dawn downing a 
freshman at joliet west high school who suggested insurance 
stickers be placed on license plates to make it easier for police 
to spot uninsured vehicles 
in the adult category deborah mccormick of joliet won with her 
call for mandatory drug and alcohol tests for all drivers involved 
in fatal traffic accidents 
about 600 people in this northeastern illinois community of 
3500 offered their 2 cents on what should be the law of the land 
wennlund said 
if the message is to seek more input from your constituents i 
think its a healthy message he said 
here are some of the suggestions that didnt win 
no naked movies on television no playboy channel in illinois 
and no school for 300 years submitted by a thirdgrade class at 
lincoln elementary school in monmouth 
pregnant woman be given stickers set to expire shortly after 
their due dates to allow them to use handicapped parking from 
beverly mcnulty of berkley 
all state residents be required to have and use common sense 
from a 70yearold constituent whom wennlund declined to identify 
no drinking in illinois no drugs and no kissing in cars from 
a secondgrade class at lincoln school 
wennlund said the winners selected by a panel of five 
journalists would be invited to springfield this spring to track 
the progress of their bills 
he said he came up with the idea for the contest last year when 
an educator suggested schoolbus drivers be tested annually for 
drugs and alcohol

washington ap democrats on thursday urged president bush 
to take a hard line against japanese trade barriers when he meets 
with prime minister toshiki kaifu this weekend but they delayed 
action on retaliatory legislation 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo told bush in a 
letter he should go into the meeting saturday in california with 
the new prime minister armed with specific proposals for opening 
the japanese market to more us exports 
the time for talking about the problem is coming to an end and 
the time to actually produce results is here gephardt said 
referring to a continuing annual 50 billion us trade deficit 
with japan 
bush and kaifu are meeting just a week after trade negotiators 
for the two countries made little progress in talks in tokyo on 
removing structural barriers that effectively keep us products 
and services out of the japanese markets 
us officials had hoped for more progress after the ruling 
liberal democatic partys large victory in japans parliamentary 
election feb 18 but the last round of talks remained focused 
largely on technical matters 
our negotiators are now complaining openly about japanese 
intransigence said sen max baucus dmont chairman of the 
senate finance committees trade subcommittee 
baucus had planned to asked the committee thursday to approve a 
bill directing the administration to retaliate with new us 
barriers to japanese goods if tokyo doesnt agree by a june 17 
deadline to lower its barriers to american wood products 
the deadline established by the 1988 trade act also applies to 
japanese barriers to us satellites and semiconductors 
baucus however agreed to withhold the bill after us trade 
representative carla hills told him in a letter thursday the 
administration is prepared to retaliate on its own should the 
negotiations not conclude satisfactorily and on time 
hopefully president bush and prime minister kaifu can make 
progress on these isses this weekend he said 
baucus estimated that japanese tariffs building codes and other 
structural barriers are effectively keeping out between 1 billion 
and 2 billion in us forest products at a cost of 10000 jobs in 
this country

disney world 1000 and ordered the installation of highdensity 
padding nets or airbags to safeguard performers in its indiana 
jones stunt show 
in a citation disclosed thursday the occupational safety and 
health administration said actors risked falling onto concrete from 
heights of 28 feet in recreating adventure scenes from the indiana 
jones movie series at the disneymgm studios theme park 
the agency began investigating the show in october after two 
performers were injured in falls the lack of fallprotection 
devices constituted a serious violation of federal safety 
standards said the agencys area manager larry falck 
the show which has an egyptian setting opened last may 
falck said the agency could not demand that disney make certain 
changes such as adding guardrails without destroying the sense of 
danger the show tries to convey 
were saying ok you dont necessarily have to do that 
because its certain to ruin the show but at least put in 
fallprotection devices such as airbags highdensity pads or nets 
so that if they fall at least theyre not going to be hurt 
falck said 
disney spokesman john dreyer said the company would not contest 
the fine and would make the necessary changes without ruining the 
illusion of danger 
i think it will be the same exciting show as it is he said

luis alberto lacalle a career 
politician and scion of one of uruguays most prominent families 
was sworn in thursday to replace julio sanguinetti as president of 
this south american nation 
before the swearingin at congress lacalle his wife and three 
children attended a roman catholic mass at metropolitan cathedral 
the first time those two ceremonies have been linked in this 
agnostic country of 3 million since 1894 
lacalle 48 takes over a onceprosperous beef and 
grainexporting nation that is suffering economic problems and is 
still troubled by the aftereffects of a military regime that ruled 
harshly from 1973 until sanguinetti was elected president in 1985 
the military issue dogged sanguinetti and his colorado party 
during his entire fiveyear term but apparently was resolved when 
an amnesty of officers accused of human rights abuses during the 
militarys crackdown on leftist subversion was upheld by referendum 
last april 
the political stability and freedom that marked this nation from 
the last century until the militarys 12year rule was upheld when 
lacalle and his national party won the nov 26 elections 
lacalles top priority is reforming uruguays economy which 
like neighboring argentina and brazil has been dominated by the 
state and the powerful labor movement for decades 
lacalles goals include slashing inflation by more than half to 
50 percent his first year balancing a fiscal deficit and shoring 
up the social security system that once was the envy of many 
western nations 
lacalle has political backing for his proposed reforms 
including tax hikes and the sale of moneylosing state companies 
but the leftist labor confederation interunion workers plenary has 
indicated it will resist any plan that cuts jobs or benefits 
sanguinetti referred to organized labor as the biggest 
obstacle to my administration they are completely politicized 
and dont understand reason 
those attending the civil ceremony included the presidents of 
argentina brazil colombia bolivia and paraguay as well as 
presidentelect patricio aylwin of chile 
after the ceremony at congress lacalle and vice president 
gonzalo aguirre were driven to government house in a 1937 ford 
convertible that belonged to the presidents grandfather luis 
alberto de herrera the national partys dominant figure this 
century

truckers lawmakers and the bush 
administration failed to agree thursday on how best to stop trucks 
from alternating loads of garbage or chemicals in the same vehicles 
used for food hauls 
while there has been almost universal agreement on the need to 
end these most egregious practices unfortunately garbage 
backhauling is still legal and is still occurring every day rep 
chris smith rnj told a senate commerce subcommittee on surface 
transportation 
nearly a year ago a pennsylvania newspaper first reported that 
refrigerated foodhauling trucks known as reefers were being 
loaded with municipal solid waste at a transfer station 
in october truckers told a house panel about the related 
practice of hauling chemicals and juice back to back 
concern by food companies has helped pressure truckers to avoid 
the practice said j terry turner executive director of the 
interstate truckload carriers conference 
since last july the problem of transporting solid waste by 
truck has been addressed by the marketplace turner said in a 
prepared statement most if not all of my refrigerated carriers 
have been required by their customers to certify that they do not 
transport solid waste in their refrigerated trucks 
the practice is called backhauling because it often occurs after 
trucks have hauled food loads to the east rather than return to 
the midwest empty they carry garbage a trucker testified last 
august that he liked hauling garbage because it could not be harmed 
en route 
rep william clinger rpa said his office was tipped last 
week about a truck that carried beef and was now hauling infectious 
medical waste 
and its next load was to be boxed beef clinger said of 
course this incident has been reported to the department of 
agriculture but theres not much more that can be done so long as 
the practice remains legal 
clinger also showed a photo of a methane gas cloud rising from a 
garbagecarrying truck that had previously delivered a load of 
avocadoes to new york city he said the refrigerated truck was 
photographed following an accident last year on interstate 80 near 
clearfield pa 
the house public works and transportation committee and the 
house energy and commerce committee are trying to reconcile 
differences between bills they have approved to end backhauling 
among the disagreements thursday was which federal agency should 
take the lead 
wilson s horne of the agriculture departments food safety and 
inspection service told the panel that usda would not comment on 
two pending senate bills since both placed enforcement 
responsibility with the department of transportation 
but alan i roberts a hazardous materials specialist with dot 
said his agency opposed the senate proposals because lead 
responsibility more properly rests with usda and the food and drug 
administration with help from dot 
turner the trucking group spokesman said the answer lies in 
requirements to ensure better packaging of solid wastes the 
trucking industry did not create this problem and we should not be 
viewed as the villains he said

indian troops shot and killed 31 
demonstrators on thursday as an estimated 1 million moslems marched 
through the streets of srinagar chanting independence 
witnesses and hospital sources said 
hospital sources said at least 100 people were admitted to two 
hospitals in srinagar with 25 or more in serious condition 
witnesses said troops fired on two separate processions of 
separatists and sympathizers as they strode toward a prayer ground 
to join comrades demanding the independence of moslemdominated 
kashmir from predominantly hindu india 
the sources and witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity 
in new delhi a government spokesman confirmed 18 deaths in the 
incidents 
the situation is very bad very tense our head count is 18 
but there is confusion said the spokesman who cannot be 
identified under standing briefing regulations 
suspected moslem separatists assassinated a senior jammukashmir 
state government official on thursday in this center of the 
separatist campaign government officials in srinagar said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
they said pushker nath handoo assistant director of the state 
information department was shot as he was about to get into his 
car outside his home handoo was a hindu indias religious 
majority but a minority in kashmir 
witnesses said about 1 million people took part in a procession 
to the un military observers office in srinagar chanting what 
do we want independence and we want freedom 
it was the latest in daily demonstrations in srinagar this past 
week to push the secessionist demand 
the army fired on moslem militants at 2 pm in zakura nishad 
crossing six miles from srinagar the summer capital of 
jammukashmir killing 23 people witnesses and doctors at a 
hospital said 
they said three hours later soldiers fired on moslems in bemina 
area three miles from srinagar and at least eight people were 
killed 
the deaths brought to 145 the number of people killed in the 
latest round of secessionist violence that flared jan 20 following 
a government crackdown on moslem militants 
ghulam rasool mir among those wounded by army gunfire said at 
soora medical institute in srinagar the trouble began when 
soldiers passing by the procession in three trucks snatched a 
flag held by march leaders and the crowd retaliated by hurling 
stones 
he said the soldiers first fired in the air then at the crowd 
another victim abdul gani dar said the procession had grouped 
in neighboring towns and was marching to the idgah or main moslem 
prayer ground in srinagar to merge with a larger procession 
in new delhi the government spokesman said the army fired after 
a mob attacked a vehicle the firing was more in selfdefense 
because the mob had become violent he said 
the movement for an independent kashmir has mostly been led by 
the areas moslems who form about 65 percent of jammukashmir 
states 6 million people 
kashmir once a princely state was divided between india and 
pakistan after the two lands were partitioned following the end of 
british colonial rule in 1947 srinagar and the surrounding areas 
of the valley became part of indianheld jammukashmir state 
moslems make up 12 percent of indias 880 million population and 
hindus comprise 82 percent sikhs christians and buddhists make up 
the rest 
kashmiri militants earlier campaigned for union with pakistan 
but now demand independence and the status of a neutral nation 
india has fought two wars with pakistan over kashmir

production of illegal drugs increased 
worldwide in 1989 as drug abuse rose and efforts to curb 
international trafficking were undermined by corruption the state 
department said thursday 
but the departments annual report also noted some bright spots 
cocaine seizures were up in the united states latin america and 
the caribbean and major cocaine traffickers were captured jailed 
and extradicted to the united states 
there were encouraging developments which were counterbalanced 
by major problems said melvyn levitsky the assistant secretary 
of state for international narcotics matters 
levitsky testifying at a house panel on international narotics 
control was peppered with questions by lawmakers who were 
skeptical about the success of the war on drugs and the accuracy of 
the report 
it seems to me we are slipping badly on this said rep 
larry smith dfla noting that production of coca leaf increased 
in 1989 despite eradication efforts 
citing peru where eradication efforts have been stymied by 
guerrilla activities smith asked why dont they the peruvians 
do something levitsky said peru was resourcestarved 
members also asked why a jan 5 memo written by one of 
levitskys subordinates was watered down the memo obtained by the 
washington post criticized the government of bolivia for a total 
lack of commitment to the antidrug war 
the memo said bolivian president jaime paz zamora had appointed 
a number of corrupt officials to key antinarcotics roles 
according to the post account 
but the annual report cites encouraging signs of a new 
commitment by the bolivian government 
the author of the memo kirk kotula was unavailable for 
comment but levitsky said he was angered that the newspaper had 
obtained the documen which was one of several used to prepare the 
report 
under law countries which do not cooperate in antidrug efforts 
are ineligible for us assistance 
but in the four years since the law has been in effect no us 
ally has been declared to be uncooperative or in state department 
language decertified 
two countries laos and panama were certified reversing 
their status from last year but the united states told those two 
countries as well as the bahamas bolivia mexico paraguay peru 
and thailand what us officials think ought to be achieved in 
the drug arena in the coming year 
afghanistan syria burma and iran all counties which do not 
receive us assistance were not certified because there is no 
evidence those countries are taking steps to halt drug production 
and trafficking he said 
other countries that were certified included belize brazil 
colombia ecuador hong kong india jamaica malaysia morocco 
nigeria and pakistan 
president bush granted lebanon a waiver of certificatin based on 
national interest grounds 
in other areas the report praised the colombian government for 
its vigorous attack against the cocaine cartels 
it said international cooperative efforts led to the freezing of 
millions of dollars in drugrelated assets and that there were 
openings for meaningful cooperation in antidrug efforts with 
panama laos and the soviet union 
on the other hand the report said opium production doubled in 
burma partly because of a cessation of law enforcement activities 
and the inability of other countries to influence burmese policy 
in addition it said flagging political will and corruption 
among officials restricted progress in a number of major 
drugproducing and trafficking countries

miners in the ukrainian coalmining capital of 
donetsk went on a sixhour strike thursday to press demands that 
the entire local communist party leadership resign soviet 
television said 
the afternoon shift at a number of mines stayed off the job 
according to the tv news show vremya but the soviet news 
agency tass said many miners at a strike committee meeting were 
reluctant to go along saying the walkout would aggravate the grave 
economic situation 
nikolai volynko committee cochairman said the group called on 
afternoon shift personnel to stay home in a warning strike 
if the party officials do not quit as a result volynko said 
the committee will call on miners throughout the region to walk off 
the job friday 
he spoke by telephone from the ukrainian city 500 miles south of 
moscow in the donentsk basin the top soviet coalproducing area 
that was rocked last summer by strikes as miners demanded better 
living and working conditions an local autonomy 
on feb 7 a mass rally held in donetsk forced the resignation 
of the local party chief a vinnik but a week later another 
rally demanded the entire local party bureau quit 
eight members of the donetsk strike committee went on hunger 
strike after the bureau resolved not to tender resignations until a 
regional party conference scheduled april 67 
volynko said information gathered by the strike committee showed 
that a general strike friday would be joined by the absolute 
majority of all mines in the region 
but interfax the news service of radio moscow said its 
correspondent reported that in the donetsk area many mines have 
failed to support the call for industrial action

a national mayors organization and two state 
attorneys general endorsed legislation thursday that would reverse 
recent supreme court decisions on minority hiring in government 
in testimony before the senate labor and human resources 
committee indianapolis mayor richard hudnut iii and new york 
attorney general robert abrams called for passage of the proposed 
civil rights act of 1990 
hudnut spoke for the united states conference of mayors and 
abrams for himself and nebraska attorney general robert spire 
it must be understood that there are people in our society who 
have been excluded from the mainstream of opportunity for too long 
and that without some kind of proactive government policy they will 
continue to be excluded hudnut said 
the hearing focused on efforts to counter the effects of the 
1989 wards cove decision which critics complain transferred the 
burden of proof in certain discrimination cases to plaintiffs 
under the decision plaintiffs must prove an employer wrong who 
argues that some employment practice they are complaining about was 
based solely on a neutral nondiscriminatory consideration 
the proposals would reinstate a standard that had been in 
existence since 1972 for state and municipal employees that 
required the employer to prove that the employement practice under 
attack was not discriminatory 
abrams argued that the old griggs standard as it was known has 
benefited employers as well as plaintiffs as attorney general of 
new york abrams must argue civil rights cases on both sides 
the result has been the development of selection procedures 
that better serve to identify those who are truly capable of 
performing the job he said 
the civil rights enforcement activities of the nixon ford and 
carter administrations abrams said served to bring about racial 
and ethnic diversity in law enforcement 
congress and several presidential commissions have found that 
such diversity is essential to the reduction of citizen mistrust of 
our law enforcement activities he said

the hordes of reverent impressionist painting fans 
crowding the museum of fine arts to pay claude monets grainstacks 
homage have inspired a few neighborhood art students to produce a 
work of their own 
a new light which the students erected with hay bales 
outside the school of the museum of fine arts casts exactly that 
on the famed works featured in monet in the 90s the series 
paintings 
playing on the way the french master captured sunlight and 
shadows as they shifted throughout the day on a grainstack outside 
his back door the students are offering a similar peek at a 
onestory modern haystack framed by a freestanding fauxgilt 
frame 
its something we came up with in response to the exhibit 
across the street margaret tittemore one of three students who 
conceived the project said thursday were all affected when 
theres a blockbuster show over there 
among the more than 200 series paintings monet did in the 
1890s were 30 each of grainstacks and the rouen cathedral 24 
paintings of poplars and 18 of the japanese bridge over his water 
lily garden at giverny 
the exhibition which is in boston through april 29 includes 86 
works on loan from cities around the world and is the largest 
series ever assembled 
the students said they like monet as much as anyone but the 
internationally publicized collections arrival has also meant a 
battle for parking places crowded sidewalks and limited access to 
the museum 
so theyre taking a little harmless revenge by poking fun at the 
whole affair 
this is not a great public art statement its just a fun look 
at monet for the 1990s said tittemore who has been documenting 
bostons shifting light on film the way monet captured the rural 
french atmosphere on canvas 
the students replaced the artists 19th century grainstack with 
a 20th century haystack made up of 100 machinepacked bales 
brought in from sunny rock farms in walpole for 275 each 
its a lot like what monet saw except its in cold boston 
instead of sunny france said elizabeth nordberg a boston 
university student it catches your eye 
nestled amid snowladen shrubs on the edge of one of frederick 
law olmsteds urban parks the bulky straw sculpture is an 
incongruous sight 
passersby bundled against the cold cast an eye and sometimes 
stopped briefly to contemplate the midday shadows and bits of sun 
that streaked the sculpture early thursday 
a french woman and her young charge were out walking when the 
haystack caught the childs quizzical eye 
thats a sculpture she said in monets native tongue and 
its not very pretty 
they didnt stop to ponder the piece 
not everyone gets it said cliff pfeiffer a guard at the 
redbrick art schools front desk a lot of stodgy museumgoers 
who are coming to see the exhibit dont seem to get the humor 
but the haystack has found a home among the art students who 
are enjoying the tongueincheek humor and something more 
it might be a jibe at whats going on next door but theres 
also some art to appreciate said laila streiff a film maker and 
former student when you see the frame it signals art and 
encourages you to look at the design and what is going on in the 
texture of the hay

the bush administration could support cutting 
us aid to israel and egypt if similar cuts were applied to other 
nations as a way of freeing money for emerging democracies 
secretary of state james a baker iii said thursday 
baker told a house subcommittee that were willing to stand up 
and be counted on such a plan because it would result in the 
flexibility to put foreign aid money where it is most needed 
the secretary also told the panel he has done pretty much all 
we can do to bring the israelis into talks with a palestinian 
delegation aimed at setting up elections in the occupied 
territories an israeli cabinet meeting was scheduled for sunday 
in answer to a question by rep david obey dwis chairman of 
the house appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations baker 
said administration support for the cuts would depend on whether 
we do it in a nondiscriminatory manner 
in his busy middle east diplomacy baker said he has not found 
any significant reduction in tensions but he added at the same 
time we must find a way to respond to changes in eastern europe 
in panama and in nicaragua 
if these leaders are not able to produce for their people we 
will rue the day that the united states fell short in providing 
aid he said we are talking about supporting an extraordinary 
outbreak of freedom and democracy 
baker also said he did not want to see a repetition of the 
current years budget crunch in which some friendly countries that 
expected us aid got little or nothing because 90 percent of the 
aid budget was already earmarked by congress for specific other 
recipients 
we ought not to be hidebound by whats been done over the past 
10 years baker said he said economic aid to all of africa 
totaled just 14 million this year because theres no one up here 
lobbying for them 
his comments were the clearest indication yet that the 
administration would accept cuts to israel and egypt which get the 
largest slice of us aid as a result of their participation in the 
camp david middle east peace accord a decade ago 
israel is receiving 3 billion this year and egypt 21 billion 
out of an overall budget of roughly 10 billion for bilateral aid 
the administration has asked congress for the same amounts for both 
countries next year 
baker left himself some latitude saying he could also support a 
total elimination of earmarks or the creation of a new 
discretionary fund which the administration could use to meet new 
needs that develop during the year he also said he could support 
enlargement of the overall foreign aid budget 
but he acknowledged that those outcomes are unlikely 
earmarks have been almost sacred in congress because of the 
political clout of the countries which receive them and because of 
lawmakers view that such spending guidance is their prerogative as 
keepers of the federal purse it is equally difficult to increase 
foreign aid spending because of the popular notion that money spent 
overseas is wasted 
bush has proposed an increase of about 800 million for fiscal 
1991 which begins oct 1 to an overall level of 153 billion 
but potential new aid recipients have been popping up faster than 
the budget can accommodate them 
already there are demands for new aid to eastern european 
countries emerging from soviet domination reparations to a newly 
democratic panama and support for the new democratic government in 
nicaragua 
earlier this year senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
proposed finding the money for such needs by cutting 5 percent from 
the top current aid recipients the administration denied planting 
the idea with dole at the time but expressed agreement with its 
goal of increased flexibility in distributing aid money 
in his testimony baker also said the administration would 
support 400 million in loan guarantees for israel to build housing 
for an influx of soviet jewish refugees but only if israel offers 
assurances that it would not put any new settlers in the occupied 
territories of the west bank and gaza strip 
the money is expected to be added to an upcoming supplemental 
appropriations bill and is likely to win congressional approval 
because of israels strong support on capitol hill 
israel has declined to provide such assurances about future 
settlement but has contended that in the past that about 1 percent 
of refugees have settled in the territories 
settlements are not conducive to the peace process because 
they aggravate tensions with palestinian residents baker said 
we see them as an obstacle to peace it is not unreasonable to 
ask some assurances these funds will not be used to create new 
settlements or expand old settlements in the occupied territories 
baker also said were coming very close to the time when we 
will know one way or the other whether israel will accept a 
proposal for talks with a palestinian delegation about elections 
among the 17 million palestinians in the territories 
baker has been expressing growing impatience with israels 
failure to respond to his proposals aired during his meetings with 
the foreign ministers of egypt and israel 
weve really done pretty much all we can do we think from 
our end and we are waiting for a response from the israeli 
government baker said

the government opened the competition thursday 
for nearly 80 million that savings and loans and other financial 
institutions will be able to use to offer cutrate loans to promote 
affordable housing 
under the program included in last years legislation to bail 
out the sampl industry the 787 million will be used to buy down 
the interest rates on certain housing loans making the financing 
affordable to those whose incomes otherwise would be insufficient 
to make monthly payments 
housing and urban development secretary jack kemp who announced 
opening of the bids in his capacity as chairman of the federal 
housing finance board said the loans could add 20000 units to the 
nations stock of low and moderateincome housing 
other industry officials speaking privately said that number 
could be significantly lower but that no firm estimate was possible 
until proposals for the money are submitted 
federal home loan bank officials who participated in the 
drafting of the program have said the 787 million to be spent on 
interest buydowns should generate between 500 million and 1 
billion in housing loans with the amount again depending on the 
terms of the accepted proposals 
this new program will be of significant help to us as we work 
to meet our national goal of safe decent and affordable housing 
for all americans kemp said in a statement 
over administration objections democrats inserted the 
affordable housing program into president bushs sampl bailout which 
was enacted aug 9 in recent weeks members of congress and 
consumer advocates have complained about administration 
footdragging in starting the program 
savings and loans and other financial institutions affiliated 
with the federal home loan bank system such as some credit unions 
and savings banks will have to compete for a share of the 787 
million under rules to be published friday in the federal register 
each of the 12 regional federal home loan banks will establish a 
fund for the program as was required by the sampl legislation the 
regional banks are located in boston new york pittsburgh 
atlanta cincinnati indianapolis chicago dallas san francisco 
seattle des moines iowa and topeka kan 
kemp said higher priority will be placed on applications which 
detail proposals that meet three or more of the following 
priorities 
encouraging home ownership expanding lowincome rental stock 
making federal property available for lowincome housing promoting 
activities by nonprofit and community groups empowering tenants 
through resident management and homesteading advancing fair 
housing compliance and creating permanent housing for the homeless 
the application period runs through may 2 during that period 
kemp said the government also would accept public suggestions for 
changes to subsequent offerings under the program

chancellor helmut kohl on thursday 
rejected a polish proposal that the two germanys formulate a treaty 
recognizing the border with poland which is nervous about possible 
land claims by a reunited germany 
kohl said working out such a treaty must be left for a united 
germany 
however foreign minister roland dumas of france joined polish 
officials and others who are pressing for such an accord 
poland wants the agreement as reassurance that a reunited 
germany would not renew claims to land that the western allies took 
from germany and transferred to poland at the end of world war ii 
in his comments to reports kohl reiterated that no one wants 
to make a connection between the question of german unity and a 
moving of the borders 
he has previously said such an assurance should satisfy poland 
however he has refused to say unequivocally that no land claims 
will be made 
such a position might upset some rightwing west germans whose 
vote could help kohls christian democratic party in elections set 
for december 
in his comments thursday kohl also raised the prospect again of 
both german parliaments simply making a declaration not starting 
work on a treaty to respect the postwar borders 
such declarations however would probably just restate a west 
german parliamentary assurance made in november which left the 
final say up to the leadership of a united germany 
kohl has come under sharp criticism abroad and at home for his 
position on the lands east of the oder and neisse rivers once held 
by germany and now part of polish territory about onethird of 
poland was part of germany before the war 
his refusal to say a united germany would never lay claim to 
that land is seen as a major stumbling block on the road to german 
unification 
in addition to poland and france the united states britain and 
others have voiced concern about kohls stand 
in his comments thursday in west berlin french foreign minister 
dumas said putting off the german response in order to wait 
for the constitution of a single parliament isnt reasonable 
this border is inviolable that should be said to all the 
peoples concerned and first of all to the poles he said during 
his luncheon address at west berlins press club 
he added that poland should take part in international 
discussions leading to german reunification as it has asked 
poland has suggested that the two german governments and poland 
draft a treaty to recognize the present borders with the document 
to be signed after a united german government comes into existence 
splitting with kohl foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
indicated support for the idea kohls position puts him at odds 
with genschers liberal free democratic party the junior partners 
in the bonn coalition government 
kohl has shown increasing irritation in recent weeks with the 
prolonged international outcry over his position on the issue 
during his press conference thursday he said in the 
international arena in east and west currently the germans are 
facing criticism and a prevailing mood that we might disregard all 
the interests of our neighbors said kohl 
i have always said that a united germany must be a part of the 
total european architecture kohl said 
the chancellor said the germans will take into consideration 
the interests of our neighbors but he added that doesnt 
mean we should neglect our own interests

the government decision thursday to give 
the seabrook nuclear plant a commercial license begins a 
monthslong process leading up to the reactor generating 
electricity at full power 
seabrook operator new hampshire yankee cannot just throw a 
switch now that it has a nuclear regulatory commission license 
first it must conduct two to three months of tests 
during the past several weeks operators brought the reactor 
systems from cold shutdown 150 degrees to hot standby 
heating the primary coolant water to 557 degrees at 2235 pounds 
per square inch pressure the water was heated by rapidly 
circulating it through the cooling system 
the next steps are to slowly withdraw control rods made of 
silver cadmium and indium from the uranium fuel core then 
operators will gradually dilute the boron concentration in the 
cooling water to create fission or the splitting of atoms 
boron absorbs neutrons which careen into uranium atoms 
splitting them and releasing more neutrons creating a chain 
reaction 
at 1 percent of full power there would be 1 billion times 1 
billion fissions per second raising the temperature at the center 
of the plants fuel pellets to 1700 degrees 
plant spokesman ron sher said the first fission would take place 
within a week or two with the plant operating at a fraction of 1 
percent of full power 
it would be the second fission reaction at the plant since it 
was completed in july 1986 the first was in june 1989 during 
lowpower testing when the plant operated at up to 3 percent of 
capacity 
fission in the reactor core would heat the highly pressurized 
water circulating through the primary cooling system a closed loop 
of piping and create steam out of water in a second closed loop 
the steam would drive turbines which would drive an electrical 
generator 
seabrook could reach the ability to produce electricity for 
customers within a month at about 10 percent power sher said 
when that threshold is crossed is a matter to be decided by 
seabrooks various owners and the government boards that regulate 
them he said 
when the plant got to about 50 percent of full power it would 
be shut down so nrc inspectors could evaluate performance

small cars driven into barriers and poles at 5 
mph to test their bumpers sustained damage ranging from 769 to 
3838 an insurance study said thursday 
the most damaged among 16 1990model cars tested was the 
daihatsu charade se the least was the honda civic dx the 
insurance institute for highway safety said 
every bumper we tested this year did a poor job of preventing 
damage and some were downright lousy said brian oneill 
president of the institute 
the institute financed by the insurance industry buys the 
cars runs each one into flat barriers front and back into a 
front angle barrier and then backwards into a pole all at 5 mph 
oneill said bumper performance has deteriorated since 1982 when 
the transportation department rolled back federal requirements that 
car bumpers be able to sustain 5 mph crashes without damage to the 
vehicle the new requirement lets cars sustain certain damage in a 
25mph test 
collision energy rises as the square of speed so cars in the 
new test must handle only about one quarter of the collision energy 
in the old test 
a 1981 ford escort sustained no damage in any of the institutes 
four tests oneill said while damage to a 1990 escort totalled 
1718 
hyundai excel bumpers were weakened during the 1990 model year 
he said an excel tested before the change sustained 561 damage in 
the rearintopole test while the same model with the weaker 
bumpers cost 721 to repair 
eight cars that sustained no damage when run forward into a flat 
barriers sustained damage costing between 200 for the honda 
civic and 718 for the mazda 323 protege se when run into an 
angled barrier the institute said among seven cars with no damage 
in rear barrier tests damage in the rearintopole test ranged 
from 479 for the dodge shadow to 1404 for the ford escort the 
report said 
the institute said it found that toyota corollas manufactured in 
japan and exported to the united states have more protective 
bumpers than corollas built in california or nearly identical geo 
prizms which are built in the same plant 
the prizm had 267 worth of damage in the front barrier test 
while the the japanbuilt corolla whose bumper assembly weighs two 
pounds less had none the institute said

president guillermo endara went on a hunger 
strike thursday apparently to protest plans to drastically cut a 
bush administration request for us aid to rebuild panama 
endara set himself up in the metropolitan cathedral announcing 
his strike was in solidarity with my fellow citizens in panama 
who suffer malnutrition because of poverty he made no explicit 
mention of us aid 
however he hinted broadly at the underlying purpose of his fast 
when he told the national assembly in a speech shortly before 
let god enlighten those who have the decision to undertake 
efforts to provide the necessary financing to solve our peoples 
most urgent problems 
on wednesday sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the 
appropriations subcommittee that deals with foreign aid vowed he 
would cut the 500 million aid proposal sharply because it was too 
much to give to panama 
i guarantee you thats not going to happen leahy said 
referring to the aid package there will be no half a billion 
dollars 
i wouldnt support that and im not sure many others will 
he said in an interview 
leahy said congressmen would prefer to give some of the money 
if it is available to emerging new democracies in eastern europe 
he also said he would like to see more go to meet humanitarian 
needs in africa 
in his speech broadcast on panamanian radio and television 
endara said he would continue to work in coming days despite his 
fast he did not say how long the hunger strike would last 
in los angeles president bush announced he had lifted the last 
sanctions against panama imposed for its failure to cooperate in 
drugfighting efforts the move will allow low tariffs and fees on 
panamanian imports 
most of the economic sanctions were removed in december when 
us forces invaded overthrew military leader manuel antonio 
noriega and put endara in office noriega awaits trial in florida 
on federal drugtrafficking charges 
endara was widely recognized as the winner of last years 
panamanian elections which noriega annulled 
panamas economy has been battered by the sanctions and by 
fighting during the us invasion 
a crowd of supporters accompanied endara on thursday as he sat 
in the cathedral two blocks from the presidential palace he was 
surrounded by bodyguards and several doctors were in attendance 
talking to reporters endara also called his fast part of lent 
saying it was an appropriate time for him to express human 
solidarity with his people 
it is the second hunger strike by endara a portly politician of 
53 in less than a year endara went on the first fast on sept 19 
to protest repression by noriegas nowdisbanded defense forces

the southland corp and borden inc agreed to 
plead guilty to conspiring to rig bids for school milk contracts in 
florida and pay fines totaling 35 million the justice department 
said thursday 
court papers filed in us district court in tampa also charged 
the two companies with conspiring to rig bids for contracts to 
supply milk to federal military bases in florida and puerto rico 
and the kings bay naval submarine base in georgia 
southland which operates 7eleven convenience stores and 
borden each agreed to plead guilty to felony bidrigging charges 
the justice department said 
the plea agreements settling the criminal antitrust charges 
were submitted to a federal judge in tampa for approval 
according to court papers the bidrigging conspiracy in 
counties on the florida peninsula began in the early 1970s and 
extended through at least july 1988 
under the arrangement described in the court papers the 
conspirators discussed submitting bids and agreed which company 
would be the low bidder for specific school districts 
borden and southlands velda farms division participated in a 
scheme to rig bids for the 198788 school year in clay volusia 
brevard highlands hardee pasco polk sarasota and lee counties 
according to court papers 
southland was also charged with rigging bids in charlotte 
county the company sold its velda farms division in 1988 when it 
spun off its dairyprocessing holdings in a deal with dallasbased 
morningstar foods 
borden also admitted to participating in a separate bidrigging 
scheme involving in leon franklin bay escambia walton and santa 
rosa counties on the florida panhandle 
as part of the plea agreement borden agreed to pay 15 million 
to settle the governments civil claims southland agreed to settle 
civil claims for 2 million 
so far the justice departments antitrust division has brought 
14 prosecutions in the continuing investigation of bidrigging 
among dairy suppliers in florida 
the probe has netted convictions of three companies and nine 
individuals 
the investigation should put an end to the cynical bilking of 
our nations armed forces and the outrageous theft of millions of 
dollars from floridas schoolmilk programs said judy whalley 
acting assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust 
division 
southland spokeswoman cecilia norwood said the company has 
cooperated with the investigation since 1988 she said there was no 
evidence that senior southland management or 7eleven personnel 
were aware of the bidrigging scheme 
the scheme was confined to a few former velda farms employees 
in florida who chose to ignore a longstanding clearly stated 
company policy she said 
a borden spokeswoman at the companys headquarters in columbus 
ohio who was authorized to speak on the case had left for the day 
said a secretary who answered the telephone

bulgarias leading opposition movement is 
unwilling to return to negotiations on the countrys future if the 
communists balk at political reform a spokesman said thursday 
also thursday more than 70000 people attended a 
communistsponsored rally at a sofia sports stadium an apparent 
response to a huge opposition protest meeting on sunday 
sundays demonstration for democracy and political reform drew 
at least 150000 people official bulgarian media put the number 
even higher 
the rally thursday which was broadcast live on state television 
and organized by the sofia party organization was marked by the 
oldstyle waving of communist banners and speeches and testified to 
the strength of the ruling party 
the communists in bulgaria unlike those in other soviet bloc 
countries have retained much of their clout in national politics 
and their moves toward democracy have been hesitant and somewhat 
halfhearted 
addressing the crowd in the stadium communist party chief 
alexander lilov appealed for calm and patience and warned fellow 
communists not to give in to provocations of the opposition 
he accused the opposition of being increasingly aggressive and 
cited as a case in point the temporary occupation of the 
downtown georgi dimitrov mausoleum during sundays demonstration 
we are a strong onemillion member party and we have an 
important role to play in the future of this country said lilov 
cheered by the participants 
in an interview thursday opposition spokesman georgi spassov of 
the union of democratic forces said the communists will have to 
make further reforms if negotiations are to continue the talks 
were suspended feb 12 
in one major reform communist leaders decided last week that a 
new law on parties to be adopted by the communistcontrolled 
parliament next week would ban party cells from factories offices 
and other institutions 
but the opposition says the communists are stalling on other 
political reforms and have ignored the union of democratic forces 
on such decisions as the appointment of a new radio and television 
chief the current chief is said to have been firmly entrenched in 
the party apparatus for 20 years 
also angering the opposition is the fact that a week after 
committees representing all parties in the talks submitted a 
document on bulgarias political future the communists came up 
with a new document that was totally different 
in that draft the communist party redefined the role of the 
round table talks as dealing with the economic crisis only not 
with the political system spassov said but the economic 
crisis cannot be overcome without removing the totalitarian 
political system 
he said the communists are still reluctant to relinquish power 
if the communist party does not sign the political agreement 
that was prepared by the committees there will be no round table 
talks spassov said 
he accused the communists of planning to railroad through 
parliament key legislation that neither the opposition nor other 
groups have had a chance to discuss or amend 
he singled out the law on political parties a law on property 
and a law on names 
the law on names is a sensitive issue because it affects 
primarily the 12 million turks who had to change their moslem 
names in a violent campaign spearheaded by deposed communist leader 
todor zhivkov 
zhivkov was ousted in november as political reform swept the 
rest of the east bloc 
spassov predicted that bulgarias deep economic crisis will 
eventually crush the communists whose popularity he said is 
dwindling daily

nine months before the bombing of pan am flight 
103 the airline abandoned a key safety procedure at frankfurt 
airport requiring all checked baggage to be accompanied by 
passengers a london newspaper reported thursday 
the independent said investigators now believe the relaxation in 
security gave terrorists the opportunity to smuggle the bomb onto 
the plane in an unaccompanied suitcase without fear of detection 
the newspaper said its information was based on an internal pan 
am memorandum it said the memo was sent on march 28 1988 to pan 
ams security staff in london and frankfurt west germany 
in new york a pan am spokesman confirmed the existence of the 
memo and that the procedure concerning unaccompanied luggage had 
indeed been changed but he insisted pan am did so with the 
approval of the faa 
asked if pan am allowed unaccompanied bags on flights the 
spokesman jeff kriendler said only if the bag had been 
xrayed as per the approved faa procedure 
we did not abandon or eliminate a procedure we changed a 
procedure with the verbal approval of the faa he said 
kriendler said approval had been given verbally by ray salazar 
faas director of civil aviation security at a march 1988 meeting 
with security heads of pan am and other airlines 
in washington faa spokesman bob buckhorn said he did not know 
whether salazar gave such approval but xraying baggage is 
certainly a security procedure thats acceptable he said salazar 
was out of town 
all 259 people on board flight 103 died when it exploded over 
lockerbie scotland on dec 21 1988 fiery falling wreckage 
killed 11 on the ground 
flight 103 originated at frankfurt airport during a stopover at 
londons heathrow airport baggage and passengers were transferred 
to a larger aircraft to make the transatlantic crossing to new 
york and detroit 
investigators have reconstructed large portions of the boeing 
747 including the forward cargo hold area where the bomb exploded 
and the container in which the bomb was loaded 
the independent said the first layer of suitcases in the 
container belonged to passengers who boarded in london bags above 
that layer where the bomb was located were from connecting 
flights including frankfurt it said 
scottish police have said the bomb made of powerful plastic 
explosives was hidden in a radiocassette player they believe it 
either started or passed through the frankfurt airport west german 
police have maintained there is not enough evidence to confirm 
where the bomb originated 
the newspaper said faa regulations prohibit airlines from 
loading unaccompanied baggage onto aircraft even if it has been 
xrayed 
to avoid the timeconsuming process of matching up transit 
passengers with their baggage and removing the bags of noshow 
passengers pan am decided that unaccompanied baggage from feeder 
flights could be loaded into aircraft provided it cleared xray 
checks the independent said 
it quoted daniel sonesen then pan ams assistant director of 
security as writing in the memo we fixed the problem by 
purchasing xrays in the event of a noshow interline pax 
passenger his bag is loaded into the belly and we go 
it quoted the memo as saying salazar approved the new procedure 
the newspaper did not say specifically that the person who 
checked in the baggage with the bomb failed to board the flight 
only that no check was made that the passenger to whom the bomb 
bag belonged had in fact boarded the flight 
scottish investigators said in december that ahmed jibrils 
radical palestinian group the popular front for the liberation of 
palestiniangeneral command was one focus of their investigation 
but not the only one 
they said they were also interested in mohammed abu talb a 
member of another radical palestinian group imprisoned in sweden on 
unrelated bombing charges and other unidentified groups and 
individuals

the senate finance committee balked thursday 
at offending us sugar and shoe producers in continuing but not 
expanding special trade benefits to caribbean and central american 
allies 
without dissent the panel approved making permanent former 
president reagans 1983 caribbean basin initiative cbi that 
otherwise would expire in 1995 
however it rejected amendments by sens bob packwood rore 
and bill bradley dnj that would have reduced by 50 percent the 
current tariffs on rubbersole canvastop tennis shoes and 
establish a floor on sugar quotas 
the committees chairman sen lloyd bentsen dtexas urged 
rejection of the amendments in some ways id like to go beyond 
what weve done he said but the key is avoiding crippling 
controversies 
the initiative was intended to lift the regions depressed 
economy through a combination of direct aid and an elimination of 
tariffs quotas and other trade barriers to encourage the 
development of its exports 
excluded from the dutyfree importation however were textiles 
clothing luggage shoes dinnerware leather products and other 
sensitive goods that compete directly with usmade products 
special rules also exist for sugar and beef products 
critics contend the initiative has failed to a large degree 
because us budget deficits have forced a reduction in direct aid 
at the same time falling quotas on sugar imports to protect us 
producers have constrained the market for the regions single 
biggest export product 
quotas on allowable sugar imports from the region as well as 
other producers such as australia and the philippines have fallen 
from a total 32 million tons the year the initiative was passed to 
12 million tons last year 
all the benefits of the initiative have been lost to the 
decline in sugar imports from the quotas said bradley whose 
amendment would have raised the quota on us sugar imports from 
world exporters to 16 million tons it was defeated on a 95 vote 
packwoods amendment was defeated on a 106 vote after sen john 
heinz rpa complained it could cost the jobs of 300 workers at a 
plant in his state which assembles tennis shoes 
similar legislation was approved by the house last fall

people with less than a year to live could 
have taxfree access to their life insurance benefits under 
legislation introduced thursday by sens bill bradley dnj and 
joseph lieberman dconn 
dying patients whose doctors have certified they will live less 
than 12 months could decide for themselves how best to use the 
money to cover high medical nursing home or other expenses 
this bill is of enormous importance to the families of the 
terminally ill and the terminally ill said bradley i think 
its our obligation to show compassion for them 
bradley said life insurance benefits paid after death are 
nontaxable the proposed legislation would make them nontaxable 
before death he said the bill would protect the medicaid 
eligibility of insured patients who choose not to cash in their 
life insurance policy 
we hope to get this passed this year bradley said 
theres very little revenue cost i find it difficult to imagine 
theres going to be much opposition to this 
patients with cancer aids or other debilitating diseases who 
are forced to leave their jobs could use the proceeds of their 
insurance to avoid financial devastation lieberman said 
given the failure of catastrophic care legislation in congress 
last year the lawmakers said the measure offers help to some 
americans facing astronomical health costs 
according to lieberman more than 100 million americans have 
life insurance coverage however he and bradley had no estimate of 
how many americans might take advantage of their benefits while 
still living 
several american insurance firms have begun offering customers 
the option of freeing up their life insurance benefits in their 
last months 
the nations top life insurer prudential insurance co of 
america in january began offering policyholders with 25000 
coverage or more the option to use their death benefits at no extra 
cost newark njbased prudential requires allows them access to 
the coverage if a doctor certifies they have only six months or 
less to live 
according to joe vecchione a prudential spokesman 26 states 
have approved prudentials living benefits coverage since it went 
into effect jan 26 
connecticut mutual also has a living benefits policy lieberman

an influential leader of the 
minority serbs in troubled kosovo province has called for an armed 
uprising against the majority ethnic albanians newspaper reports 
said thursday 
the daily borba said bogdan kecman leader of an organization of 
kosovo serbs called bozur told a rally wednesday that serbs should 
arm themselves and get ready for the decisive battle against 
ethnic albanians 
about 3000 serbs who attended the rally in the provincial 
capital of pristina greeted kecmans speech with wild applause 
borba said 
kosovo has been the scene of a decade of open strife between 
ethnic albanians who represent 90 percent of the regions 19 
million population and serbs who claim they are being driven out 
of their homeland 
kecman reportedly said that yugoslavias president janez 
drnovsek should resign for what he called a failure to protect 
serb interests in kosovo 
kosovo serbs will no longer tolerate enemies of any sort 
kecman was quoted as saying he is highly popular among serbs in 
the province 
tensions remain high in kosovo where at east 60 ethnic 
albanians have died in violent clashes with security forces since 
march of last year 
the violence flared when serbia the largest yugoslav republic 
changed its constitution a year ago giving it nearly total control 
of kosovo the province already had been administratively part of 
serbia 
serbian authorities claimed the changes were necessary to 
protect kosovo serbs from alleged harassment by ethnic albanians 
also thursday the first political negotiations between the 
ethnic albanian opposition and serbian independent groups ended in 
the central yugoslav town of mostar with an appeal to federal 
authorities to start withdrawing troops from the province 
the appeal also urged kosovo citizens to refrain from 
demonstrations and strikes 
a spokesman for the organizers in mostar said serbian 
authorities failed to show up at the meeting despite earlier 
pledges that they would come 
serbias leadership and kosovo serbs previously have rejected 
any talks with ethnic albanian opposition movements claiming their 
leaders are separatists who want the province to secede from 
yugoslavia and join neighboring albania

a nationalist leader said thursday 
that conservative columnist patrick buchanan was right in opposing 
statehood for puerto rico even though its for racist reasons 
filiberto ojeda rios selfproclaimed leader of the clandestine 
macheteros nationalist movement said buchanan was correct in 
believing that if we become a state a new northern ireland will 
spring up here 
this man is right when he says that if statehood sees the day 
there will be a revolution in puerto rico ojeda rios said on a 
radio talk show 
the irish republican army is struggling to expel british troops 
from northern ireland a british colony 
in a column published in the washington times and other 
newspapers this week buchanan wrote that he opposed statehood for 
the spanishspeaking us commonwealth saying it would convert 
us into a bilingual nation he said it would be impossible to 
impose english on puerto ricans 
buchanans article appeared in spanish on wednesday in the san 
juan daily el mundo 
a vote has been set for june 1991 giving puerto ricans a choice 
among independence statehood or more autonomy 
the united states took control of puerto rico at the end of the 
spanish american war in 1898 the caribbean islands commonwealth 
status allows the island largely to govern itself 
ojeda rios said that while buchanan objectively described 
what would happen if the island became the 51st state he also said 
buchanan is a racist who cant see puerto rico as part of the 
united states because of his racist and discriminatory mentality 
ojeda rios is one of 19 people charged in connection with the 
1983 robbery of 7 million from a wells fargo depot in hartford 
conn he is free on bail awaiting trial in connecticut 
the macheteros claimed responsibility for several bombings and 
other attacks on us government installations on the island during 
the 1970s and early 1980s

militarystyle boot camps used in 14 states as 
an alternative punishment for lawbreakers are not suitable for the 
federal prison system its top official said thursday 
only about 60 of the more than 54000 federal prisoners fit the 
criteria most states use for placing offenders in boot camp said 
j michael quinlan director of the federal bureau of prisons 
however quinlan told a senate subcommittee the federal system 
was developing a prototype intensive confinement program that would 
expose selected inmates to a highly structured environment as in 
boot camp 
he also voiced qualified support for the camps on the state 
level but only as alternatives to probation parole and other forms 
of punishment that dont involve incarceration 
they should not replace imprisonment for criminals who should be 
behind bars and should not be considered a tool for reducing prison 
crowding he said 
most offenders sentenced to prison should be there to enhance 
public safety quinlan said a justice department study found 
that 95 percent of state prisoners were violent criminals or repeat 
offenders while the rest were either burglars or drug traffickers 
he said 
the governmental affairs subcommittee on oversight of government 
management conducted the hearing to explore the feasibility of boot 
camp in the federal prison system and of lending federal assistance 
to state camps 
sen carl levin dmich the panels chairman said the camps 
could prove especially useful in preventing youthful offenders from 
becoming hardened criminals 
prisons are too often nothing but graduate schools of crime 
releasing young offenders who are even more violent and antisocial 
than when they entered prison he said boot camps are a chance 
to break that cycle

cubas top diplomat in the united states 
dismissed on thursday suggestions his homeland will undergo an 
anticommunist upheaval similar to the one in eastern europe 
jose arbesu head of the cuban interests section said in a rare 
public appearance that unlike eastern europe cubas revolution was 
home grown and was not imposed from abroad 
cuba also differs from eastern europe because it faced social 
economic and political problems that were created as a result of 
57 years of governments allied to north american us 
monopolies he said 
the conditions of poverty illiteracy and desperation which 
were products of the colonial relations meant that the only way to 
overturn those conditions was to become the owners of our own 
resources arbesu added 
he spoke to a gathering on capitol hill sponsored by the center 
for development policy a liberal research group 
arbesu a veteran of numerous postings abroad has headed the 
cuban mission in this country since last spring the united states 
and cuba have not had full diplomatic relations since 1961 and deal 
with each other instead through the socalled interests sections 
arbesu said the revolution has raised life expectancy lowered 
infant mortality and has a solid record in the war against 
illiteracy and in cultural development benefits which are 
universal and free of charge 
all of this was made possible because our economy has 
developed despite a 28year blockade and because of the political 
will of the cuban people he said what other countries in the 
third world can exhibit such achievements 
although cuba is aware that very serious difficulties could 
lie ahead he said there has been no change in cubas economic and 
commercial relations with the soviet union 
according to us estimates cuba receives more than 6 billion 
in various forms of assistance from the soviet union us 
officials also have said that the soviets no longer provide cuba 
with surplus oil for resale to other importing countries for cash 
a profitable business for cuba in the mid1980s 
arbesu made no reference to cubas criticism of soviet president 
mikhail gorbachevs reform program highlighting instead continued 
sovietcuban cooperation 
as an example he said the two countries agreed recently to add 
250 million worth of new staples into commercial exchange 
we have had and now maintain fraternal relations with the 
soviet union based on friendship and cooperation he said our 
exchanges have been just but they have not developed on the basis 
of begging or charity nor without giving anything in return nor 
conditioned on the political or ideological behavior of the cuban 
revolution as it has been portrayed here 
under questioning arbesu rejected the suggestion that the 
defeat of nicaraguas leftist government a close ally of cubas 
for years will have a major impact on the island 
he said the cuban revolution survived for almost 20 years before 
the sandinistas came to power in nicaragua

the prime minister of benin appealed 
to striking workers thursday to go back to their jobs as he took up 
a 10month mandate to bring democracy and economic stability to his 
west african nation 
benin state radio monitored in abidjan reported that prime 
minister nicephore soglo promised to pay government workers who 
received none of their salaries in january and february the 
workers began strikes and protests that helped force president 
mathieu kerekou to relinquish power wednesday 
kerekou a brigadier general who seized power in a 1972 coup 
remains head of state and chief of the armed forces 
but at a national conference of leaders he was stripped of his 
post as defense minister and soglo was named to head a new 
transitional government and organize democratic elections in 
january 1991 none of kerekous aides are allowed to sit on the new 
cabinet 
kerekou said he agreed to step aside in the national interest 
and for the greater interest of the people of benin 
there was no indication thursday how workers were reacting to 
soglos appeal for them to return to work on monday a day before 
he is expected to name his advisers and inaugurate the new 
government 
cotonou radio said the interim leader had tried to impress on 
strike leaders the need for austerity measures imposed in agreement 
with the international monetary fund and the world bank in return 
for loans benins economy has been bankrupted by marxistleninist 
economics 
benin a former french colony is one of the worlds poorest 
nations with a per capita income of 310 and a foreign debt of 
nearly 1 billion 
western economists say kerekous efforts to impose centralized 
controls hampered economic growth austerity measures introduced 
since kerekou was forcd to negotiate with the international 
monetary fund in 1986 have failed to revive the shattered economy

five members of a skinhead group were found 
guilty thursday of racially motivated hate crimes against jews 
blacks and hispanics acts the us attorney general called 
simply intolerable in a free society 
an allwhite federal court jury deliberated for about four hours 
before convicting all five men of two counts of conspiring to 
violate the civil rights of minorities 
the five vandalized a jewish synagogue and harassed blacks and 
hispanics at a dallas park former skinhead members testified that 
the group known as the confederate hammerskins had planned to 
pump poison gas into the temple 
prosecutors characterized the trial as the governments first 
major assault against white supremacist groups the term 
skinheads refers to the shortcropped hair worn by members to 
show unity 
each of the charges carries up to 10 years in prison and a 
250000 fine us district judge barefoot sanders said the 
earliest possible sentencing date would be april 19 all five 
remained in custody 
attorney general dick thornburgh vowed further prosecutions of 
hate crimes saying acts of racial and religious hate such as 
those disclosed by the evidence in dallas are simply intolerable 
in a free society 
let the word go out that the federal government intends to 
bring to bear the full force of the law on every such act that 
comes to its attention thornburgh said in a statement 
the trial drew attention from such groups as the new yorkbased 
antidefamation league of bnai brith which called the verdict 
a major victory in the continuing battle against hateinspired 
violence by skinheads around the country 
the average american is fed up with racist ignorance said 
richard dockery director of the southwest office of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people 
we have people tired of being afraid to live in their own 
homes dockery said they have to lock themselves up in their 
homes live like animals they cant walk the streets they cant 
use their parks 
the defendants were jon lance jordan 19 of garland sean 
christian tarrant 20 and daniel alvis wood 20 of dallas

have been convicted doesnt mean there arent more radicals and 
bigots around 
on wednesday justice department prosecutor barry kowalski urged 
jurors to tell these five men they cant conspire and stalk 
dallas like racist spirits in the night 
defense attorneys countered that the men were being tried for

had a right to exercise free speech even if their beliefs are 
unpopular

senate leaders and president bush compromised 
thursday on future air pollution controls for automobiles 
factories and electric power plants enhancing chances that a clean 
air bill will pass this year 
the agreement after more than three weeks of closeddoor 
negotiations was viewed as a middle ground likely to attract 
enough support to thwart continuing regional opposition in the 
looming senate debate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine called the compromise 
a sound and comprehensive agreement that will substantially 
improve air quality over the next decade he planned to bring the 
legislation to the senate floor on monday 
president bush is extraordinarily pleased with the agreement 
it is a milestone an enormous step forward said roger porter 
the presidents chief domestic policy adviser 
porter said the administration would attempt to expedite senate 
passage and seek a similar agreement in the house where cleanair 
legislation remains in committee 
but the compromise is still likely to encounter stiff industry 
lobbying largely because of its estimated 20 billion to 40 
billion annual cost to the economy 
both industrial and environmental groups issued statements 
thursday denouncing the compromise 
some senators also have expressed concern that the bargaining 
weakened provisions in the original senate bill that would have 
required stronger automobile emission controls to combat urban 
smog other have voiced continued concern about the impact of acid 
rain controls 
the agreement fails to require the controls we need to provide 
clean air in the nation and in new jersey said sen frank 
lautenberg dnj who participated in some of the private 
discussions but said he would not support the compromise on the 
senate floor 
sen bob dole rkan the minority leader called the 
compromise a giant step forward in revising federal air 
pollution laws for the first time in 13 years but he cautioned 
that many senators likely will seek changes when the measure goes 
to the senate floor 
he urged mitchell not to handcuff anyone during the floor 
action by rushing to cut off debate 
the agreement made some accommodations to regional interests 
especially those concerned about the local economic cost of acid 
rain controls 
on that score the compromise continues to require a 10 million 
ton annual reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions but allows 
midwest utilities to achieve extra credits and allowances that 
could be sold to other utilities to recoup some of the costs 
plants that use new technology instead of switching away from 
highsulfur coal to another fuel could delay compliance for two 
years would receive additional credits for early cuts in emissions 
provisions designed to help west virginias coal industry 
about a dozen senators from the midwest had threatened to 
filibuster the legislation if some accommodation were not met to 
ease their concerns about the high costs of the pollution controls 
mitchell said he still could not discount the threat of a 
filibuster but various senate sources suggested that with the 
compromise mitchell likely would have enough votes to halt debate 
sen robert byrd dwva said he would seek additional changes 
to the bill but im not going to engage in any filibuster he 
said 
we did not have a choice between the good the bad and the 
ugly we had a choice between ugly uglier and ugliest said sen 
christopher bond rmo who during the private talks sought to 
work out provisions to ease the plight of midwest utilities that 
rely heavily on highsulfur coal 
the breakthrough on the legislation came wednesday when leaders 
agreed on pollution curbs on automobiles 
the compromise eliminates an automatic second round of auto 
tailpipe controls although such measures could be put into effect 
if more than 11 of 27 cities with serious ozone pollution 
problems fail to meet federal air quality standards at the end of 
this decade 
the white house had strongly opposed the second round of 
controls as had the auto industry but environmentalists state 
pollution control officials in areas with the dirtiest air and 
some senators argued the second round of controls are needed to 
deal with smog in such areas as southern california and the 
northeast 
in the final days of negotiations an agreement also came on the 
acid rain provision after senators from the west were assured that 
the utility emission controls would allow for future growth in 
electric capacity and some accommodation was made to the midwest 
region 
earlier tentative agreements were struck on how to curb toxic 
and smogcausing emissions from industrial plants 
under the compromise industrial plants will have to use the 
best available technology to curb releases of 192 toxic chemicals 
including carcinogens or cancercausing agents early in the next 
decade a health standard would require plants to reduce 
emissions further if the cancer risk to nearby residents is still 
too high 
a broad range of industries and businesses also would have to 
comply with tougher controls on smogcausing emissions the 
compromise however would exempt thousands of smaller polluters 
which would have been covered by the original senate bill 
environmental groups meanwhile chastised the negotiations and 
said the compromise agreement severely weakened the original senate 
bill 
the backroom dealing has generated bad deals for the american 
people complained richard ayres chairman of the national clean 
air coalition 
but industry did not like the agreement either 
the edison electric institute called the agreement 
unnecessarily costly for the nations utilities the chemical 
manufacturers association called the tougher controls on toxic 
chemicals too stringent and politically motivated and ignoring 
scientific facts about health risks 
the agreement is far from what business and industry would 
consider acceptable said william fay administrator of the clean 
air working group industrys umbrella lobbying organization on 
clean air issues 
theres no question the bill has been improved but there are 
still some real problems said helen petrauskas vice president 
for environmental engineering at ford motor co 
though the bill avoids any requirement that automakers sell a 
specific number of cars that burn clean fuels which favors 
industry the exhaust standards are still tougher than the industry 
would like she said

the seabrook nh nuclear power plant 
won federal permission thursday to produce commercial electricity 
after two decades of protests and legal struggles that made it a 
symbol of the national antinuclear movement 
the nuclear regulatory commission voted 30 to grant a license 
for seabrook to operate at full power but delayed issuing it for 
two weeks to allow an expected appeal in federal court 
two of the commissions five members abstained from the vote 
because of involvement in seabrook issues prior to becoming 
commissioners 
opponents have long maintained that people near the plant would 
be trapped in a nuclear emergency and officials in massachusetts 
with a border just two miles from seabrook said they would indeed 
take the case to the us court of appeals in washington 
foes also claimed a broader victory contending that as a result 
of the long fight against seabrook no utility would be willing to 
risk the monetary and other costs of trying build and open another 
nuclear plant 
the commissions ruling ratified recommendations by its staff 
and several lowerlevel boards that the plant is safe and that 
evacuation plans would work 
i would be happy to live within two miles of this plant and i 
wouldnt worry about it at all said nrc chairman kenneth carr 
however massachusetts attorney general james shannon said we 
will be in court in the next few days there has never been a 
licensing issue which has been so legally vulnerable 
massachusetts officials along with new hampshire antinuclear 
groups have coordinated the seabrook opposition 
at the whitedomed plant overlooking the atlantic ocean 75 
protesters sang and chanted slogans and 10 blocked the plant gate 
by sitting down in the driveway when they refused to leave they 
were arrested another seabrook opponent was arrested when he 
posted a sign that read shame over one posted by plant workers 
reading license approved 
at the nrc meeting utility executives hugged each other after 
the ruling while seabrook opponents said that their fight against 
seabrook had helped stall the nuclear power industry 
i feel great im delighted said ted feigenbaum chief 
operating officer of new hampshire yankee the company that 
operates seabrook we will be starting the plant up as soon as 
the license is received no later than march 15 he said it would 
take two to three months for the 1150 megawatt plant to reach full 
power 
feigenbaum said opposition to seabrook contributed to its 
current 65 billion price tag which will be felt by ratepayers in 
the northeast 
were going to have to deal with this long licensing 
process feigenbaum said it took too long and all this 
litigation hasnt added one iota to the safety of the plant 
in a new hampshire news conference new hampshire yankee 
president edward brown said the nrc decision marks the end of a 
long convoluted challenging licensing battle for us the 
decision represents a triumph of reason professionalism 
perseverance and common sense 
while opponents had expected thursdays vote they said the 
losing battle over seabrook should help win a larger war against 
nuclear power 
the price paid to finally secure seabrooks license has been 
so great that no utility will ever again be willing to risk the 
high economic costs the bad public relations and the protracted 
political fight necessary to bring a nuclear power plant on line 
said ken bossong of public citizen one of several groups opposed 
to seabrook 
in the mid1970s during construction of the plant thousands of 
antinuclear protesters flocked to seabrook and hundreds were 
arrested in acts of civil disobedience the protests picked up 
again last summer as the plant drew closer to a fullpower license 
the seabrook construction period was marked by a sharp decline 
in public and investor support for nuclear power according to 
public citizen a private group active on many issues and opposed 
to nuclear power 111 us reactor orders were canceled and 11 
operating plants were retired during seabrooks construction nrc 
chairman carr noted that there are no new applications for nuclear 
plants before the commission and an nrc spokesman said the last 
request was filed in 1978 
the licensing decision comes at a time when new england faces 
acute energy problems marked recently by the skyrocketing price of 
home heating oil and in the past several summers a shortage of 
electricity during heat waves seabrook can produce enough 
electricity to power a million new england homes 
seabrook has been plagued by financial troubles a situation 
that opponents say could affect plant safety 
first conceived in 1968 seabrook was to have been a 
twinreactor power plant costing 1 billion by 1986 with one 
reactor ready to operate the partially completed second reactor 
was mothballed since then the cost has continued to climb 
northeast utilities of berlin conn is awaiting final state 
and federal approval of a 23 billion buyout of public service 
company of new hampshire which owns 36 percent of seabrook the 
largest single share 
public service which could not collect any of the cost of 
seabrook from customers until it started generating electricity 
sought court protection from creditors under under federal 
bankruptcy laws in 1988 the first private utility to do so since 
the great depression 
opponents also have argued that there are as yet no longterm 
plans on what to do with the nuclear waste seabrook would produce 
but carr dismissed that concern 
the disposal of radioactive waste is not a technical 
problem carr said it is a political problem

the senate approved a 125 million program of 
grants thursday to encourage volunteer work ranging from fighting 
illiteracy to cleanup drives in the nations forests woods and 
parks 
the basic idea is to challenge young people and old people 
alike to give something back to america for all that its given to 
them sen edward m kennedy dmass said as the senate 
approved the measure 7819 
the measure would authorize 125 million for volunteer programs 
through the end of the fiscal year that starts oct 1 
it would earmark 25 million for schoolbased programs 
involving teachers aides tutoring and the teaching of reading it 
also would provide 35 million for a youth service corps involving 
park and forest cleanup programs for volunteers 16 to 25 years old 
a program for individuals 17 and older would focus on service in 
education environment public safety and other fields and would 
be authorized to receive 25 million 
also authorized would be a 25 million points of light 
foundation sought by republicans in keeping with president bushs 
campaign remark that the needy in america would be helped through 
volunteer efforts from a thousand points of light the 
foundation would encourage volunteerism 
states would bid for grants under the plan the money would be 
distributed by a 4 million commission on national and community 
service to be established under the bill 
all the money would have to be appropriated in annual bills and 
the appropriations could be less that the amounts authorized which 
act as ceilings on appropriations 
the bill was a slimmeddown version of the legislation that 
initially went into the hopper 
it took kennedy the bills floor manager four days to shoehorn 
it through a balky senate as lawmakers kept attempting to pile on 
amendments some unrelated to volunteerism 
the longest fight came over a proposed amendment sponsored by 
sen william armstrong rcolo to allow big brothers and other 
volunteer groups in the district of columbia to bar homosexuals 
from activities involving minors 
after hours of wrangling the senate adopted a kennedy 
substitute which would allow volunteer groups to bar homosexuals if 
they had been convicted of a crime or were currently charged with 
one 
its just plain wrong for any arm of government to force 
private volunteer groups to unite adult homosexuals with minors as 
companions and role models armstrong said later 
lawmakers sought to attach provisions concerning the nicaraguan 
elections and the repression of dissent in china 
liberals praised the bill as one that would usher in a new 
spirit among americans what we do in this bill is begin to get 
away from the values of wall street and go back to the values of 
main street of neighbor helping neighbor said sen barbara 
mikulski dmd 
some volunteers would receiving living allowances and other 
stipends as well as education and housing benefits 
as the final vote neared sen rudy boschwitz rminn took the 
floor to condemn the notion of paying volunteers a young person 
has got to feel like a chump if hes not paid under this bill 
he said benefits paid to some volunteers under the program 
including living allowances and health insurance were not in 
keeping with the spirit of volunteerism 
he also warned against expansion of the program citing a danger 
that the senate would beget some broad programs perhaps some 
very broad programs that are going to cost millions perhaps 
billions each year

joseph hazelwoods efforts to move the 
grounded exxon valdez off a reef was reckless because the skipper 
was not dead certain of his ships location a marine salvage 
expert testifed thursday 
but william milwee jr of portland ore acknowledged under 
heated cross examination that no matter what hazelwood had done 
after the ship grounded the exxon valdez could not have moved 
anywhere 
there is absolutely no question this ship would not have moved 
using its engines alone said milwee 
no matter what capt hazelwood did asked defense attorney 
michael chalos 
no matter what capt hazelwood did responded the witness 
but capt hazelwood did nothing to try and determine that 
milwee said hazelwood should have taken soundings to 
determine exactly how solidly his ship lay aground on bligh reef 
but he conceded on cross examination that such soundings in 
which a lead line is dropped over the side of a vessel might not 
have been accurate because of the amount of oil in the water around 
the ship 
the exxon valdez a 987foot tanker spilled nearly 11 million 
gallons of alaska crude oil within the hour after it ran aground in 
prince william sound it was the nations worst oil spill killing 
countless birds fish and other wildlife and blackening hundreds of 
miles of rocky shoreline 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is on trial charged with 
criminal mischief a felony and three misdemeanors reckless 
endangerment operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent 
discharge of oil he could face 7 years in prison and fines of 
61000 
a key element in the charges against him is recklessness about 
which each of the prosecution expert witnesses was asked milwee 
was the second witness in a row to say he considered hazelwoods 
actions as meeting the legal criteria for being reckless by 
consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk 
there has been dispute at hazelwoods trial over whether the 
skipper by maneuvering the ship forward risked capsizing it or 
causing further damage to its gashed underbelly milwee and another 
prosecution expert witness robert beevers said hazelwood did the 
wrong thing but beevers acknowledged before leaving the stand that 
no additional damage occurred because of hazelwoods efforts 
milwee a former navy salvage expert who now works as a 
consultant insisted that hazelwood should have tried to secure the 
ship on the reef if he was unsure of the extent of the grounding 
if you try to refloat her there is a chance of doing 
additional damage he said he added that hazelwoods actions 
after the grounding were consistent with trying to get the ship off 
the rocks 
you shouldnt attempt to move a ship in any way until you have 
knowledge of the water that lies around it he said stressing 
that his advice to a captain in such a situation is find out 
what youve got 
assistant district attorney brent cole asked the witness how 
certain a captain should be of a situation before he attempts 
refloating 
dead certain said the witness 
but on cross examination by chalos milwee was confronted by a 
reference book that he himself had used in preparing his opinions 
the book contained 14 points of advice for action by captains of 
grounded ships 
as chalos read off each of these suggestions the witness 
acknowledged that hazelwood had done almost all of the recommended 
procedures including alerting the engine room lowering lifeboats 
sending a distress message and calling for tugs to stand by 
on each of the points chalos asked him was that a correct 
action 
correct action answered the witness

a leftist guerrilla group declared a 
unilateral truce thursday to allow peaceful balloting in march 
national elections and a radio report said two other important 
rebel groups would soon follow 
the peoples liberation army a maoist group said in a 
communique it would refrain from any attacks until april 1 
a spokesman read the communique over a crackling telephone line 
during a live radio broadcast by the caracol network caracol did 
not say from where the broadcast orginated 
caracol citing informed sources said two other groups the 
revolutionary armed forces of colombia and the national liberation 
army also would declare unilateral ceasefires in the coming days 
the total estimated strength of the three groups is 5000 to 
10000 armed rebels estimates by security forces of the total 
number of armed insurgents in colombia vary from 10000 to 20000 
the revolutionary armed forces of colombia or farc is the 
countrys largest guerrilla group with an estimated 5000 armed 
members it recently declared its willingness to negotiate a truce 
if the government changes the constitution to allow more political 
participation 
the national liberation army is led by a defrocked priest and 
inspired by the teachings of fidel castro unlike farc it has said 
it will never negotiate with the government and has carried out a 
number of attacks in recent weeks in an effort to disrupt 
legislative and municipal elections to be held march 11 
meanwhile army troops killed six leftist guerillas belonging to 
farc in gunbattles late wednesday near the northeastern towns of 
labranzagrande and arauca police said 
also wednesday national liberation army guerrillas attacked the 
northern towns of banco and tamalamequito in an effort to pressure 
residents not to vote the magdalena state police said the 
administrator of bancos airport was killed in the attack 
in the cocaine capital of medellin dynamite attacks wednesday 
against four energy company facilities left 30 percent of the 
citys residents without electricity local officials said 
a group calling itself the popular militiamen telephoned local 
radio stations to claim responsibility for the attacks which they 
said were in response to a recent increase in the citys 
electricity rates 
in another sign of escalating political tension officials of 
the patriotic union party said several men wearing military 
uniforms painted death threats against party members on walls in 
segovia a town 265 miles north of bogota 
a group calling itself death to revolutionaries of the northeast 
left a message in the mayors office threatening to kill him and 
other local party leaders if they did not leave town within three 
days caracol reported 
patriotic union officials have blamed rightwing death squads 
for mondays assassination of the mayor of the northern town of 
apartado also a member of the marxistoriented party 
the party leaders also blamed the death squads for the killings 
this week of six other party members a freelance journalist and 
three leaders of an agricultural cooperative 
the partys president diego montana said 72 members have been 
assassinated so far this year 
earlier this week party leaders demanded the dismissal of 
defense minister oscar botero and three army brigade commanders 
accusing them of responsibility for waging an extermination 
campaign against the leftist party 
president virgilio barco said the allegations would be 
investigated but suggested the accusations might be an attempt by 
the party to gain sympathy among voters before the elections

president bush and his predecessor ronald 
reagan disagreed in a social chat thursday on when the contra 
rebels in nicaragua should disarm 
the disparity cropped up when bush stopped in to visit reagan at 
his los angeles office 
the former president was asked by reporters during a photo 
session if the contras should lay down their arms now that the 
nicaraguans have ousted sandinista president daniel ortega in their 
elections 
reagan replied dont you think it might be time enough for us 
to wait and make sure that there is a civilian government in place 
in nicaragua because the sandinistas had their arms and their 
weapons long before any nicaraguan citizens picked up arms and 
became the contras 
reagans administration built the contras from a handful of 
stragglers into a force of some 12000 fighters 
both ortega and the usbacked candidate who beat him violeta 
chamorro have also demanded the contras lay down arms 
bush earlier thursday said he was confident the contras would 
disarm asked if he was directly calling on them to do so he told 
a news agency reporter yes put it on the wire 
as bush sat next to reagan in the former presidents highrise 
suite in the century city offfice neighborhood reporters asked 
bush if he concurred with reagans comment 
bush said he had already expressed himself on the subject and 
then fell back on his sometime rule of declining to answer 
questions at photo sessions 
reporters asked reagan to elaborate on whether he believes the 
contras should stay together until mrs chamorros inauguration on 
april 25 as the contras have said they want to do 
well i dont know whether to wait that long or not but 
things could take place foreshadowing what the situation would be 
earlier than that reagan replied he did not explain further 
what he meant 
bush as reagans vice president for eight years endorsed the 
policy of providing the contras military assistance 
reagan gave videotape testimony last week in the trial of his 
natiojnal security adviser john poindexter who is charged with 
obstructing congressional inquiries into the irancontra diversion 
of profits to the contras from arms sales to iran 
bush broke last year with his predecessors militaryoriented 
policy on nicaragua endorsing a diplomatic solution and the 
regional peace process that led to last weeks election 
contra officials initially said they would not give up until 
mrs chamorro takes office because the sandinistas still control 
the nations large military and police forces 
they have since said they will hold talks with mrs chamorro on 
their conditions for disarming 
bush administration officials have said since the election that 
there is no longer any reason for fighting and the sandinistas 
announced a unilateral ceasefire 
when bush refused to answer reporters questions reagan said 
his successor was doing exactly what is right for him just have 
a little more freedom now 
bush laughed leaned over and touched reagans arm and said 
we have a slight difference in policy 
bushs visit with reagan was purely a social call said press 
secretary marlin fitzwater 
the two sat on couches in front of windows looking out on a 
skyscraper view of the city 
a plate of assorted cookies was on the glass coffee table in 
front of them

a former justice department prosecutor told 
congressional investigators the fbi instructed him to drop his 
investigation of cia links to failed savings institutions a house 
subcommittee chairman said thursday 
rep frank annunzio dill chairman of the house banking 
subcommittee on financial institutions said staff aides following 
up allegations published by the houston post interviewed the 
former prosecutor twice 
the prosecutor told the staff that while pursuing a bank 
failure investigation he was told by fbi agents to drop the 
investigation of one of the individuals connected with the bank 
failure because that individual had cia connections annunzio 
said in a letter to rep anthony c beilenson chairman of the 
house intelligence committee 
the prosecutor was also told that the individual involved had 
a get out of jail free card annunzio said 
one of the fbi agents present confirmed the prosecutors 
account the congressman said 
annunzio refused to identify the prosecutor 
lloyd monroe a brown university researcher who prosecuted bank 
fraud cases while with a justice department organized crime task 
force was quoted by the houston newspaper as saying he believes 
the cia masterminded or condoned some sampl fraud 
three weeks ago annunzio asked cia director william webster to 
appear at a closed session of his panel to respond to the 
allegations webster declined 
the cia labeled the allegations scurrilous and 
unsubstantiated and said it would be inappropriate for webster to 
appear before a banking subcommittee 
annunzio asked beilenson whose committee has jurisdiction over 
the cia to investigate 
i do not think a wellrespected former justice department 
prosecutor and a former fbi agent would make up something so 
serious as the cia charges annunzio said 
daniel childs director of the intelligence committee staff 
said the staff would conduct a preliminary investigation to 
determine if a fullfledged probe is warranted he said it was too 
eqarly to tell if webster would be asked to testify

president bush said thursday there are no 
talks under way for the release of american hostages in lebanon but 
said he was willing to undertake private or public discussions if 
that would win their freedom 
i will do everything i can privately openly whatever it 
takes to get them out of there without trading for hostages 
bush said 
he said a spate of recent news reports suggesting movement in 
the hostage situation were ridiculous stories 
were not in the negotiating process bush said 
in a brief exchange with reporters bush repeatedly denied that 
there were any secret discussions under way in geneva or elsewhere 
about the hostages 
despite bushs comments the sister of one hostage just back in 
new york from an overseas mission on behalf of her brother said 
she was optimistic that the hostages would be released soon 
i assume theyre talking as they always have done through 
third parties said peggy say referring to the united states 
government 
she is the sister of terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press and the longestheld of the 
eight americans and 10 others held hostage in lebabon 
anderson was kidnapped in beirut on march 16 1985 
i was reassured traveling throughout europe the middle east 
and africa there will be a release without conditions there will 
be no ransom there will be influence by everyone concerned for a 
positive conclusion and building bridges she said 
that isnt to say my optimism means theres going to be a 
release today or next week or next month 
the syrian commitment is 100 percent she said 
saying he hoped there would be some movement bush said id 
love to see them release these hostages 
the president repeated his exhortation to iran which is 
believed to have influence over the hostagetakers that goodwill 
will beget goodwill 
and goodwill means releasing kidnapped prisoners bush said 
and so thats where it stands 
bush said i dont spend a day that i dont think about the 
hostages but there are no secret talks going on 
and i have read some of the most ridiculous stories printed 
with anonymous sources failing t do anything other than repeat 
rumors 
he said he saw one story saying he had talked with french 
president francois mitterrand about the hostages and the story was 
denied but then cropped up again 
theres something going on thats crazy bush said 
referring to the stories 
bush said he called in brent scowcroft his national security 
adviser after reading stories that talks had been held in geneva 
on the hostages 
he said he asked scowcroft are there any talks have there 
been any direct indirect in geneva and he said no 
bush said now let me tell you something if i thought a talk 
in geneva would result in letting people go free i would undertake 
the talk 
and if i thought the way to conduct that talk was to do it 
quietly i would do it in that mannerhe continued if i 
thought the best way to get the hostages out were to publicly have 
talks in geneva i would do that but there arent any 
former president ronald reagan also was skeptical of the hostage 
stories 
during a meeting with bush reagan was asked by a reporter if he 
had any words of caution for the president regarding the hostages 
well the way most leaks turn out the caution i think would be 
wait until somebody could prove it reagan said 
it was an attempt to win the hostages freedom that led reagan 
to sell arms to iran in secret

the costa rican government will ask 
the united states to extradite john hull who has been linked to 
the 1984 bombing of a nicaraguan rebels news conference in which 
four people were killed a foreign ministry source said thursday 
the source who did not want to be identified by name said the 
costa rican embassy in washington will present the extradition 
request on monday 
hull skipped bond and fled to the united states last july after 
living 20 years in costa rica he owned a ranch near the nicaraguan 
border and has been accused of having ties to the reagan 
administration and of supplying weapons to the usbacked contra 
rebels 
hull a native of princeton ind who acquired costa rican 
citizenship during his years in the central american country was 
released from a hospital thursday in evansville ind where he had 
been treated for heart problems attempts to reach him in his home 
in patoka ind have not been successful 
in january costa rican officials accused hull of responsibility 
for a 1984 bombing that resulted in the deaths of three journalists 
and a nicaraguan rebel along the costa ricannicaraguan border 
the target of a may 31 1984 explosion in a house in penca 
nicaragua is believed to have been eden pastora a contra rebel 
commander at the time who had defected from the sandinista 
government 
instead the victims were linda frazier an american reporter 
two costa rican journalists attending pastoras news conference and 
the rebel pastora and about a dozen other people were injured 
hull has called the charges politically motivated and has 
denied involvement with the contras drug trafficking and the 
bombing

thursdays editions of the new york times as saying he signed the 
extradition order last month esquivels office said the judge

cuban planned the bombing to avenge pastoras statements linking 
hull to the cia the whereabouts of vidal and the man who placed

should be tried in the united states where it would be easy to 
show that the accusations are false 
hull did not flee costa rican justice only a change in 
jurisdiction the attorney added

seabrook nuclear plant workers cheered and 
raised a sign proclaiming victory and protesters blocked gates 
outside the complex thursday after the government allowed it to 
begin producing power 
about 125 protesters demonstrated at the three gates to the 
plant by the time the protest ended around 730 pm about 6 
hours after it began police had arrested 72 people including 25 
juveniles who were not charged said town police dispatcher tarnya 
janvrin 
the government announcement flashed in the plants reception 
center shortly before noon said edward brown president of 
seabrook operator new hampshire yankee 
maintenance workers richard young and earl chafe had a sign 
ready and hoisted it on a billboard startup 90 we have the 
power it read 
its about time said young who has worked at the 
longdelayed plant for more than a decade 
the 30 nuclear regulatory commission licensing vote gave 
opponents a stay of up to two weeks to file legal appeals which 
foes have promised the plant has been the subject of antinuclear 
protests since before its 1976 groundbreaking 
plant spokesman dave scanzoni noted that a flurry of appeals in 
mid1989 delayed lowpower testing only briefly we expect the 
same situation would happen and wed be producing electricity very 
soon he said 
when news of the approval reached 50 demonstrators outside the 
gate they began singing we shall overcome kurt ehrenberg a 
veteran protester became the first to be arrested after he walked 
through the main gate and posted on a guard shed a sign that read 
shame over one declaring license approved 
as protesters chanted slogans 10 teenagers sat down in the 
driveway to the gate they were arrested as were some 20 
demonstrators who walked through the gate later 
most of the 47 adults arrested were charged with criminal 
trespass two were charged with disorderly conduct and others with 
blocking traffic janvrin said reading from a news release 
as police took ehrenberg away to book him on a disorderly 
conduct charge he called out im not a criminal the real 
criminals are gov judd gregg and the nrc 
gregg a republican called the nrc vote a major step forward 
in resolving the issue but said the final word will rest with 
the federal appeals court 
should the court affirm this decision then the final step 
will have been made and the plant should be turned on gregg said 
in a statement 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis denounced the nrc action the 
former democratic presidential candidate had fought licensing on 
grounds that communities near seabrook including six in his state 
could not be evacuated safely in event of an accident 
he promised to keep fighting besides battling in court we 
will also encourage congressional investigations to hold the 
nrc accountable for its actions he said 
plant spokesman ron sher defended seabrooks federally mandated 
emergency plans which are expected to be the focus of the court 
battle 
we havent just developed plans that are adequate weve 
developed plans that work sher said this week 
state senate majority leader edward dupont hailed the watershed 
vote 
we need the energy from seabrook said the republican 
lawmaker a longtime seabrook supporter im very positive that 
today is a good day for new hampshire 
in washington dc ralph naders public citizen organization 
called licensing a pyrrhic victory for the nuclear industry 
the price paid to finally secure seabrooks license has been 
so great that no utility will ever again be willing to risk the 
high economic costs the bad public relations and the protracted 
political fight necessary to bring a nuclear power plant on line 
the group said in a statement 
but brown said seabrooks triumph could inject new life into the 
nations dormant nuclear power industry 
some have called seabrook station a bellwether for the future 
of the entire nuclear industry in the united states he said i 
cant predict if that will be true or not but if the licensing of 
our plant helps to preserve the option of generating electricity by 
nuclear power in our country then i believe we have made a very 
important contribution to americas energy future

peace in nicaragua apparently has not spilled 
over into the united states senate where a bitter debate over past 
us policy erupted late thursday and prompted one senator to ask 
plaintively why cant we just shut up for a change 
the extended exchange began when conservative sen malcolm 
wallop rwyo offered a nonbinding resolution congratulating 
opposition candidate violeta chamorro on her sunday election 
victory and insisting that the current leftist government of daniel 
ortega turn over all power including the military to her 
wallops resolution called deplorable an ortega assertion 
that his party would continue to govern from below and said it 
was a violation of his commitment to abide by the results of the 
election 
chamorro won it all shell be the president of the army the 
police and the people said minority leader bob dole rkan 
sen christopher dodd a connecticut democrat from the opposite 
end of the ideological spectrum then rose to offer a different 
version one that included mention of costa rican president oscar 
arias role in starting regional peace negotiations 
but debate soon ranged far from that topic senators got bogged 
down in an argument over which was most responsible for nicaraguas 
free elections former president reagans policy of arming the 
antisandinista contra rebels or arias 1987 peace initiative 
to suggest that the contra aid program would have produced the 
events on sunday is ludicrous on its face dodd argued 
then sen john danforth rmo who had been an official 
observer in nicaragua on sunday came to the floor shaking his head 
i cant believe my ears the best conceivable outcome has 
taken place in nicaragua and we are keeping the battle alive in 
the senate 
his voice growing louder danforth added cool it cool the 
rhetoric why cant we just shut up for a change why do we 
have to rub it in with ortega why do we have to reach over there 
and tweak his nose 
passions finally cooled when the two sides agreed to withdraw 
the resolutions and enter what wallop called some negotiations in 
good faith to work out a compromise 
on a voice vote later in the evening the senate passed a 
resolution commending the nicaraguan people for their recent 
successfully held election 
the resolution called for a spirit of reconciliation by all 
parties and for a peaceful transition of power

opposition sen juan ponce enrile 
dismissed as a total fabrication on thursday charges that he 
aided a failed coup against president corazon aquino 
officials also filed a new complaint against enrile claiming he 
misappropriated funds during the administration of the late 
president ferdinand marcos 
enrile 66 was among seven people indicted tuesday in 
connection with the failed coup last december he is the most 
prominent figure charged in any of the six coup attempts against 
mrs aquino 
when he was defense minister in february 1986 enrile turned 
against marcos and led the military mutiny that drove marcos into 
hawaiian exile where he died and swept mrs aquino into office 
enrle was fired as defense chief in november 1986 after his 
followers tried to overthrow the new government 
at a news conference thursday at a suburban police headquarters 
where he was in detention enrile said the charges of rebellion 
with murder were phony and were meant to harass him for opposing 
mrs aquino he is the countrys lone opposition senator 
do you think that now that i am in detention the aquino 
government will be stable i dont think so enrile said mrs 
aquino will find out that her case is based on nothing else but 
lies 
foreign secretary raul manglapus defended the arrest he said it 
will not damage the countrys image abroad because because it shows 
the aquino government is determined to tackle internal problems 
enriles lawyer renato cayetano said thurday he will ask a 
lower court handling the charges to defer arraignment pending a 
supreme court decision on his clients petition for freedom 
arraignment has been set for monday 
the senators lawyers who include two former supreme court 
justices asked the high court to rule the charges were illegal and 
unconstitutional 
under the law rebellion is punishable by up to 12 years and 
murder by a maximum sentence of life in prison 
also thursday solicitor general francisco chavez filed a 
complaint alleging that enrile businessman eduardo cojuangco rep 
clara lobregat and 16 other people misappropriated at least 45 
million in government funds while acting as administrators of the 
governments investment fund for the coconut industry 
the complaint filed with the presidential commission on good 
government was the fourth against enrile and the sixth against 
cojuangco and lobregat in connection with the investments fund 
the commission will decide whether to seek an indictment 
on wednesday mrs aquino denied opposition charges that the 
arrest of enrile her archenemy was motivated by vindictiveness 
as marcos martial law administrator from 1972 to 1981 enrile 
ordered the imprisonment of thousands including mrs aquinos 
husband benigno aquino jr who was later assassinated 
the opposition has also accused mrs aquino of trying to stifle 
dissent with the arrest military dissidents say it is a prelude to 
martial law 
troops have been on maximum alert in the manila area since 
tuesday to prevent any reprisals from enrile supporters 
on thursday court proceedings were halted and employees 
evacuated quezon city hall after a bomb threat but police found no 
explosives police defused a homemade bomb wednesday at a shopping

from the sandinista armed forces as the deadline nears for 
president daniel ortega to step down from office draftees and 
draftees relatives said thursday 
ortega was defeated in sundays election by violeta barrios de 
chamorro who has promised to abolish the draft after she is 
inaugurated on april 25 some deserters are apparently planning to 
hide out until that happens 
her office announced meanwhile thursday that the presidentelect 
will send a special mission to the united states next week to seek 
economic aid for nicaragua ravaged through the years by economic 
mismanagement and usimposed sanctions 
it said francisco mayorga 41 who has done postgraduate work at 
yale will head the mission mayorga has often been mentioned as 
possible minister of economy after mrs chamorro takes office for a 
sixyear term 
it will be an exploratory mission to have an initial picture 
of whats needed which we will combine with offers for aid already 
arriving from western europe and latin american countries 
mayorga told reporters 
he said his team will visit washington and new york for talks 
with world bank interamerican development bank and international 
monetary fund officials 
although the leftist sandinistas agreed to give up power to mrs 
chamorro and her united national opposition alliance they have 
presented tough demands as transition teams meet to discuss terms 
the sandinistas want the economic structure they set up left 
alone uno wants to decentralize the economy privatize state 
enterprises and free the marketplace 
the sandinistas also want the military structure left intact 
especially if the ussupported contra guerrillas dont disband 
uno wants to depoliticize the military and reduce its size 
both sides want the contras to disband immediately but contra 
leaders say not until mrs chamorro is inaugurated 
ortega has insisted on keeping the draft where soldiers get 
leftist political indoctrination alongside military training mrs 
chamorro wants children to go back to school and the government 
to stop making a soldier of every child 
widespread desertions as reported on thursday could undermine 
the sandinista position and the authority of defense minister 
humberto ortega daniel ortegas brother 
juan carlos medina 18 said thursday that 40 of 60 young men in 
his sandinista air force unit posted at the main air base at 
managuas international airport deserted this week 
he said they took our weapons away on monday and didnt give 
them back maybe they didnt trust us 
they gave me an unsigned weekend pass i changed into my 
civilian clothes and just walked off base medina went on 
nobody asked me any questions but im not going back 
one military source speaking on condition of anonymity told 
the associated press that president ortega had ordered the military 
not to stop draftees from leaving 
lt col rosa pasos the defense ministry spokeswoman denied 
there was an ortega order along those lines but she said it was 
normal to have desertions under the current circumstances 
she added that it was up to commanding officers to decide how to 
react to the desertions we could by law go and get them ms 
pasos said 
but she added no deserters are being chased down because we 
definitely dont want to have people who dont want to be with 
us she said and anyway were going to reduce the army 
medina said he has 11 months to go before completing the 
twoyear compulsory military service for all boys age 16 
i left because dona violeta is going to do away with the 
service so why wait he said 
maria antonieta mendoza said her grandson 17yearold jose 
manuel nunez lopez deserted from his sandinista peoples army unit 
in san nicolas near the northern city of esteli 
he just showed up here last night with nine other boys from 
his unit said mrs mendoza they had been hitchiking all day 
i almost died i told him what if they come and kill you 
mrs mendoza who said she had raised nunez since infancy let 
him sleep the night then early thursday sent him into hiding with 
friends he has six months to finish his military service and will 
turn 18 this month 
they were treating those boys so badly making them eat only 
spaghetti for two weeks and digging tunnels she said 
she said he told her of other desertions in northern nicaragua 
a battle area with the contras 
mrs mendoza said her grandson told her the officers are 
hiding all the weapons in tunnels that theyre going to leave only 
the old weapons for dona violeta 
witnesses in juigalpa reported seeing army trucks taking 600 
boxes of munitions out of an army depot in construction ministry 
trucks an army source said they were slated to be hidden at 
ministry facilities 
medina said air force officers have said they will not turn 
their weapons over to the new government 
theyrave our cards ready that 
we would be allowed to leave on march 5 we draftees decided to 
wait until the 5th and if they dont let us go were leaving 
meanwhile ortega gave a speech to journalists at voice of 
nicaragua saying he would fight to keep the station from becoming 
a voice of the government even though it has always been the 
government radio station

president bush on thursday lifted the last 
sanctions against panama imposed for its failure to cooperate in 
drugfighting efforts and then toured a maximumsecurity prison 
saying tough talk is simply not enough in battling crime and 
narcotics 
bush in a daylong series of appearances in los angeles also 
held a fundraising luncheon with republican governors and was to 
address the california chamber of commerce at dinner 
in addition bush met with former president ronald reagan who 
took a more cautious approach than bush on the question of 
disarming the contra rebels in nicaragua 
bush said he had sent a message though diplomatic channels 
urging the contras to lay down their arms after the defeat of 
leftist president daniel ortega 
reagan however in response to a reporters question said 
dont you think there might be time enough for us to wait and 
make sure that there is a civilian government in place in 
nicaragua 
bush asked if he shared reagans concern declined to comment 
except to say we have a slight difference in policy 
on friday bush will fly to palm springs for a twoday summit 
with japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu to try to repair 
relations strained by trade tensions 
its going to be an interesting meeting bush told reagan 
weve got to move forward on some of the tough problems we 
have he said kaifu was a very good man 
in his dinner speech bush told businessmen that he strongly 
supports drug testing of prospective employes we need to make it 
very clear to every american that if you do drugs you dont get 
hired bush said 
he also urged them to donate some time and expertise to the 
emerging businesses now struggling in eastern europe work with our 
neighbors to the south in panama and in nicaragua as the transfer 
of power takes place 
most of the economic sanctions against panama were removed in 
december following the us invasion and the toppling of manuel 
antonio noriega who now awaits trial in florida on federal drug 
traffiking charges 
the final remaining sanction was a denial of low tariffs and 
fees on panamanian imports that was imposed in 1988 because of a 
finding that panama under noriega was not cooperating fully with 
the united states in battling drugs 
bush said the usbacked government of guillermo endara was 
taking adequate steps to prevent the sale and shipment of drugs 
and the illegal laundering of drug profits 
all sanctions have now been removed against panama said 
white house deputy press secretary stephen hart 
interviewed by cable news network endara called the sanctions 
news excellent and said we in panama are very very thankful 
for mr bush 
separately bush certified that 20 countries where narcotics are 
produced or transported were cooperating with the united states to 
fight drugs 
the certification is necessary for them to be eligible to 
receive us foreign assistance the countries include panama and 
colombia bush said he was including lebanon on the list as a 
matter of us national interest 
bush said he had decided not to certify afghanistan burma iran 
and syria 
bush on the second day of a fourday trip away from washington 
spent the morning touring the north los angeles county correctional 
facility a 134 million hightech jail built to house 2064 
inmates it opens next week 
the president said a tour like his although brief does 
concentrate the mind it was long enough to bring anyone face to 
face with the reality of what institutions like this represent 
he said jails were the ultimate proof of the communitys 
determination to protect itself and serve justice 
noting that no federal money was used to build the jail bush 
said thats a sign that your vibrant community knows that in 
the fight against crime and drugs tough talk is simply not 
enough 
and if youre going to be tough on crime youve got to be 
tough on the criminals bush said talk to any law enforcement 
officer and theyll tell you what that means no more revolving 
door no more criminals out on the street because there isnt 
enough cell space to hold them 
he also called for tougher state and federal laws against crime 
and for stiffer penalties including the death penalty for anyone 
who murders a law enforcement officer 
he said the federal government was doing its part spending 15 
billion this year to build new prisons to house 24000 inmates 
bush said he is asking congress to add 374 million more to the 
prisonconstruction budget in 1991 
at the prison bush also told law enforcement personnel not to 
be dismayed by the indictments last week of 10 sheriffs deputies 
and the wife of one of them on charges of skimming profits from 
drug dealers 
dont let it get you down bush said noting that they had 
the largest sheriffs department in the world with 11000 people 
keep your heads high some bad apple turns up an officer abuses 
your trust or ours by doing wrong we must be that much more 
dedicated

conservative leaders while proclaiming the 
global decline of communism cause for celebration began looking 
thursday for new problems and new threats to keep their 
movement together 
at the opening of the 17th annual conservative political action 
conference david keene chairman of the american conservative 
union said movement activists once highly suspicious of george 
bush have been somewhat pleasantly surprised by him 
i think most conservatives are relatively pleased with the 
direction the administration has taken said keene 
vice president dan quayle considered the top conservative voice 
in the administration said the conservatives should congratulate 
themselves for the victories of democratic movements in central 
america and eastern europe 
we are the ones who created the environment for the berlin 
wall to fall quayle said at the organizations dinner thursday 
night 
although delivering his speech just a few feet from where 
nicaraguan contra leader adolfo calero sat quayle barely touched 
on the future of the usbacked rebels now that a new president 
has been elected freely in that country 
why do you think it is that the people of nicaragua had a 
chance to vote for freedom and democracy and the people of cuba 
have never had the chance to vote for freedom and democracy the 
vice president asked the reason is very elementary in nicaragua 
we supported the democratic resistance in cuba we abandoned the 
resistance let us not make that mistake again 
earlier thursday rep newt gingrich of georgia the house 
republican whip noted that the democrats have won only one of the 
last six presidential elections and said we can beat the left 
the question is can we govern 
he said people would not be asking conservatives what are you 
going to do about health care what are you going to do about drugs 
and violent crime what are you going to do about education 
the georgia congressman said that governing is incredibly 
harder than opposing 
gingrich reminded the conservatives that many of them were 
disappointed in ronald reagan a movement hero and said we will 
be disappointed in bush were going to be disappointed in the 
president that follows he added that conservatives should 
cheerfully get everything that we can today and come back in the 
morning for more 
but he warned the movement must learn not to turn its internal 
fights into holy wars 
keene who has described anticommunism as the glue that holds 
the movement together said that the decline of communism as a 
threat had forced conservatism into a period of reshaping 
itself 
there will be new problems and new threats he said 
he said developments overseas were forcing conservatives and 
republicans to focus on other problems all in all i would prefer 
to have that problem than an armed and aggressive soviet union 
he said that while some defenseoriented conservative groups 
were having trouble raising money those with a populist social 
platform were doing well 
attendance at cpac was about the same as at the 1989 
conference said keene who acknowledged that the peak years were 
the first few years of the reagan presidency

dozens of aftershocks continued to rattle 
southern california on thursday the day after a strong earthquake 
jolted the region causing more than 127 million in damages 
officials said 
safety inspectors in los angeles and neighboring san bernardino 
counties began checking gas and water lines and older unreinforced 
brick and masonry buildings in communities that sprawl beneath the 
san gabriel and san bernardino mountains 
the estimate of more than 127 million in damages to private 
and public property including 10 million in damages to the town 
of pomona was very preliminary cautioned mike guerin of the 
state office of emergency services the figure was based on reports 
from cities and counties guerin said they and we acknowledge 
the numbers are incomplete 
wednesdays 343 pm quake measured 55 on the richter scale 
and was centered three miles northwest of upland 40 miles east of 
los angeles 
it was the most serious temblor to hit california since 
octobers magnitude71 quake in the san francisco bay area which 
left 67 people dead and sparked fears of the massive earthquake 
predicted for the state in coming years 
dozens of aftershocks continued to shake southern california on 
thursday with the days strongest magnitude 30 at 1255 pm 
we just had a nice little aftershock claremont assistant 
city manager bridget distelrath said we just get big eyes 
theyre very short they dont last long enough to get under a 
table 
immediately after wednesdays jolt there was a 5 percent chance 
of a larger quake within three days based on historical 
statistics said seismologist lucile jones of the us geological 
survey in pasadena but she said that by thursday the probability 
had dropped to 2 percent or 3 percent 
injuries from the quake appeared to be minor cuts bruises and 
a few broken bones were the chief complaints officials said 
state office of emergency services officials said it appeared 
that upland la verne pomona ontario and claremont were most 
affected with pomona and claremont each declaring emergencies 
la verne city council members on thursday afternoon decided to 
withdraw an emergency declaration issued the day before they 
learned damage was likely to range only between 500000 and 
750000 said mayor pro tem thomas r harvey 
things are much better than we ever expected harvey said 
adding 62 buildings in la verne were reported damaged 
pomona mayor donna smith said during the afternoon that her 
citys damage estimate was 10 million down from an earlier figure 
of 20 million 
city officials said they decided after a tour of pomona that the 
damage was not as bad as initially thought although city 
inspectors declared 301 buildings damaged and 17 uninhabitable 
smith said there was extensive damage to grandstands at the los 
angeles county fairgrounds 
pomona city hall was closed as workers shoveled out broken glass 
and replaced it smith said the building would reopen friday 
the city of 113000 is the largest in the immediate vicinity of 
the epicenter 
among the damaged structures was the historic phillips mansion 
which was built in 1875 and was the home of one of the areas 
founding families said smith a chimney on the mansion crumbled 
and crashed through the roof 
also in pomona brick and concrete trimming from a wall of the 
chapel of the trinity united methodist church tumbled through a 
roof and into an unoccupied sunday school nursery below about 40 
children in a day care center in the building escaped injury 
its lucky the sunday school nursery wasnt being used at the 
time i understand there was a brick in a crib said helen 
tayles an office manager for the pomona unified school district 
which operates the center 
the children were moved to another building while inspectors 
examined the church and its buildings damage was estimated at 
50000 
in la verne about 40 structures were damaged including a 
20foot by 70foot wall at an auto parts warehouse that collapsed 
said assistant city manager jeff allred at least 70 workers ran 
for their lives but no one was seriously injured said supervisor 
stan sokolowski 
in upland about 25 reports of minor damage were being 
investigated officials said 
the city library where books flew off shelves remained closed 
for cleanup the officials said city hall where a picture window 
shattered was open for business as were schools 
officials in san bernardino county said it would take several 
days before they could attach a dollar amount to the damage which 
appeared to be minimal 
were pretty much back to a normal mode here we came through 
it pretty much unscathed said al langworthy emergency 
preparedness planner for san bernardino county 
the greatest concern we had was the short failure of our 911 
system and the total overload of conventional phone lines 
langworthy said 
rock slides that blocked mountain and canyon roads were cleared 
by the california highway patrol 
the quake five miles below the surface ruptured a fault 
running from the northeast to the southwest said seismologist kate 
hutton at the california institute of technology it followed a 
36magnitude quake at 1237 pm 
the worst recent southern california quake struck the whittier 
area oct 1 1987 it measured 59 and together with a 
53magitude aftershock on oct 4 killed eight people injured 
more than 200 and caused 358 million in damage 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs an earthquake of 5 can cause considerable damage and 
6 severe damage

environmental officials said eight bands of oil measuring up to 
500 feet wide and three miles long were sighted in lower new york 
bay as close as 50 to 60 yards from the new jersey shore

in a confirmation of timehonored ways a study 
today concludes that the oldfashioned stethoscope is just as good 
as electronic monitors and maybe even better for checking 
babies during birth 
the researchers found signs that cerebral palsy may be more 
common among infants whose births are electronically monitored 
possibly because the monitors led doctors to wait longer before 
acting to rescue a baby in distress 
but they cautioned that this finding could be a statistical 
fluke experts said moreover that monitors are likely to remain 
in use in part because they require less manpower in the delivery 
room 
electronic fetal monitors were introduced in the early 1970s and 
now are a fixture of delivery rooms everywhere still doctors have 
only recently begun rigorous testing to see if the machines help 
produce healthier babies

while environmentalists generally praise the 
criminal indictment of exxon corp in the massive alaskan oil 
spill some are bemoaning the fact that no individual corporate 
officials were charged 
there are some people hiding behind the corporate cloak 
erik olson an attorney for the natural wildlife federation said 
wednesday if you are not punishing the individuals you are only 
punishing some ethereal corporate artificial entity 
but proving criminal legal violations against individuals would 
be much more difficult than bringing charges against the 
corporation and its subsidiary exxon shipping co legal experts 
say 
a corporation doesnt act through one person but may act 
through a combination of individuals so no one of them had a 
requisite criminal intent said norman bernstein a washington 
environmental lawyer who represents large corporations

help abcs promising new action drama 
about an experimental new york city emergency services unit has 
more than its share of problems 
thats too bad because help which premieres saturday 
is shot entirely in new york and has a few splendid actors fighting 
to breathe life into what is rather formulaic writing 
the show is about the experimental and fictional harlem 
eastside lifesaving program which combines police fire and 
paramedic services under a single commander fire battalion chief 
pat meacham 
the politically beleaguered meacham is ably played by john 
mahoney a tony award winner in john guares house of blue 
leaves on broadway 
chief meacham mahoney and new york city have their work cut out 
for them in the batty pilot episode written by executive producers 
dick wolf and christopher crowe and directed by crowe 
help opens on a child floating face down in a bathtub 
cut to childs hair zoom in on horrified reaction of older sister 
cut to panicked mom mom runs past teddy bear cut to calm 
dispatcher panicked mom ambulance rolling overhead shot of 
unconscious child cut to haggard unshaven chainsmoking 
dispatcher telling mom he will coach her in cpr 
at some point one becomesaware that the scene has the same 
style texture and warmth of commercials we get these days from 
large multinational corporations the susceptible viewer will feel 
immediately compelled to run out and buy a cellular phone or 
something the sequence is manipulative shallow and cheap check 
it against the commercial that immediately follows 
theres an exciting sequence of a helicopter evacuation from a 
burning tugboat in the east river the operation gets meachams 
politically touchy program into conflict with his supervisor and 
mentor a plump smooth district chief wonderfully played by john 
finn 
theres another wonderful performance from brad sullivan 
playing a coarse demanding older firefighter who plagues the 
sensitive rookie tom breznahan the old pro is the most 
interesting character in the episode but theres every indication 
this will be a onetime appearance by sullivan and that is 
genuinely too bad 
help throws in some arson a barely comic incident in 
which a cougar prowls a tenement cellar official corruption an 
implausibly swift arson investigation and an unbelievably pat 
ending 
in the 44plus minutes of ernest dickersons swooping 
photography you will become tired of the overhead shot and 
atmospheric lighting of smoky offices and unsmoky burning buildings 
believability is something this show needs if it is to survive 
for it seems to have been conceived as hill street blues with 
fire engines 
responsibility for that must lie with wolf who was coexecutive 
producer of miami vice in its last two years and was executive 
script consultant for hill street blues 
publicists for help promise us the same gritty 
groundbreaking style that made a hit of hill street blues 
that gritty ground though is pretty much broken and what 
help gives us is pretty much just another 
firefightercopparamedic show 
thats a great pity to this reviewer for there is something 
fundamentally dramatic about a line of work that sometimes requires 
human beings to run into burning buildings and crawl around on the 
floor in search of their fellow human beings 
until help can convey that it is in trouble 
 
elsewhere in television 
holy batathon cable televisions the comedy channel is 
holding a marathon sunday showing of vintage batman but were 
talking real vintage not the campy series that ran on abc circa 
196668 sundays batathon features two serials batman and 
batman and robin that first appeared in movie theaters in 1943 
and 1949 respectively each serial has 15 episodes with each 
episode running about 18 minutes and ending with a cliffhanger

wendy stanek stiffened instantly 
she had been slouched on the witness stand acting more like a 
defiant teenager than the undercover drug informer that she is 
then the lawyer asked about threats 
threats yeah someone has been calling me lately said 
stanek a mother of seven im thinking of moving the kids yes 
pivoting in her chair she glared at half a dozen defendants 
accused of dealing drugs each of whom she had helped put in the 
iron county courtroom that day whoevers calling me i hope 
youre enjoying it she said to them 
stanek expected threats when she contacted the police last 
summer and volunteered to become an informer in crystal falls a 
remote timbering town of 1965 people near the wisconsin border in 
michigans upper peninsula 
now a caller is promising to do perverted criminal things to 
her children 
yes its bad this 35yearold unemployed twicedivorced 
barmaid said late one night last month drinking beers and smoking 
cigarettes at a downtown tavern a friend was home watching the 
kids 
the bar owner ordered a beer and sat down beside stanek i 
give her a lot of credit he said raising his glass in salute 
the police are doing what they can about the threats trying to 
identify the caller and increasing patrols past her twostory house 
in the middle of town but they say they have no way to protect 
stanek totally from retribution 
officers warned stanek it might be like this all it takes is 
one idiot all it takes is one flake said lt bill johnson the 
michigan state police detective who heads upset the upper 
peninsula substance enforcement team a federally funded drug task 
force 
wendy is one who just wouldnt listen johnson said she 
was motivated very strongly because of the death of her son 
staneks life turned on its edge in june 1987 when her eldest 
child 15yearold ryan died in a car crash after hitching a ride 
home with friends who had been at a party 
his ashes are in a marble box in a glass cabinet in the corner 
of the dining room ryans soiled baseball cap sits on top of the 
box next to staneks many citations and a photograph of a crystal 
falls girl who killed herself one of three local teen suicides 
last year a reminder to stanek of the perils faced by the towns 
children and her own 
stanek describes the cabinet as my little tomb 
after an emergency room nurse mistakenly gave stanek the clothes 
of another boy hurt in the accident and she found a hash pipe 
tucked in one of the shoes stanek took her rage and grief to 
johnson and upset in june she penetrated the drug world in 
crystal falls and surrounding small towns buying more cocaine and 
marijuana than the task force could pay for 
she said she simply picked up the phone and called almost 50 
people and asked if they would sell her marijuana or cocaine all 
but one said yes 
stanek said it was amazingly easy it gave her a giddy sense of 
justice anybody could do it you could do it she told a 
reporter 
she broke her cover and quit her bar job at christmas when upset 
went public with 23 arrests in crystal falls iron river and 
neighboring towns 
the threats started immediately 
those people are scums anyway stanek told the associated 
press after the first calls they said they would hire a hit man 
from chicago big deal 
until a feb 14 message the threats were aimed only at stanek 
but on valentines day she received an envelope with a magazine 
clipping of a mother caressing a naked baby there was also a 
handwritten note 
less than 15 minutes after this picture was taken the woman 
was stripped completely nude and both she and the child were 
thrown into a large vat of boiling water bye bye wendy 
the calls threatening to harm staneks children always by the 
same male voice were coming at the rate of one a day until 10 days 
ago when they tapered off but stanek is still considering moving 
her family out of michigan 
staneks eldest son jamey 15 wants to stay in crystal falls 
i dont want to move he said wearing a plaid hunting shirt 
and fidgeting at the kitchen table anxious to go snowmobiling 
i wont go jamey said 
hell go said stanek who went on welfare after quitting 
her job and who spends most of her days in court testifying against 
the men and women she says sold her drugs 
around their disagreement chaos momentarily held forth 
thirteenyearold rikki her blonde hair moussed in the latest 
gravitydefying fashion had just baked a cake but was insisting 
her mother frost it twoyearold lacy wearing nothing but one of 
her brothers tshirts was racing barebottomed across the 
linoleum behind a hyperactive terrier mutt named pee wee 
after spending an eighthour day at the courthouse stanek stood 
in the kitchen juggling the demands of supper a skillet of ground 
beef and hamburger helper along with the cake the dog her kids 
a reporter and a photographer and telephone calls from a 
television network news producer 
this is normal said scott thrasher staneks boyfriend as he 
watched from a perch at the kitchen table 
the threats have not changed staneks life said thrasher who 
owns a gas station in nearby sagola 
most of it has been good thrasher said when we go out to 
dinner somebody stops by to congratulate wendy 
but the threats against her children have the otherwise 
unshakeable stanek worried she turned from the stove gripping the 
skillet of hamburger in one hand and the spatula in the other 
if they touch my kids ill kill them

if you think the conscience of an investor 
is a contradiction in terms you havent reckoned with one 
persistent and growing trend in the world of finance 
by most accounts the old idea of ethical or socially conscious 
investing not only survived but thrived through the supposedly 
amoral 80s 
now some observers think the idea is poised for a new surge to 
prominence one day soon they postulate securities like stocks 
and mutual funds could come in for the same degree of social 
scrutiny now focused on items like fur coats and disposable diapers 
social investing was once looked upon by investment 
professionals as a fringe activity dominated by kooks and cranks 
says suzanne harvey an analyst who specializes in the subject for 
prudentialbache securities inc 
today large and small moneymanagement firms as well as 
individual retail advisers are all finding that to ignore this 
market is to risk losing out on billions of dollars of business 
in the mutual fund industry for example she says funds with 
social or ethical agendas now manage some 76 billion in assets 
compared with about 55 billion two years ago 
while thats still only a small slice of a 1 trillion business 
it has already grown bigger than some skeptics thought it ever 
would get 
if there has been one dominant responsibility issue in the 
investment world to date it has been the politics of south africa 
the moneymanagement business here in the united states will 
never be the same as a result of the racial tension in south africa 
and the social investment trend it spawned ms harvey says in a 
justpublished report on the subject 
without question the success of the antiapartheid 
communitys efforts to bring pressure on south africa through the 
investment markets in the united states has encouraged phenomenal 
growth in activist groups pursuing the same path for their own 
special causes 
among the other subjects prubache has singled out for attention 
to date northern ireland the environment defense nuclear power 
tobacco and alcohol product quality and treatment of employees 
with aids it doesnt take much imagination to think of other 
potential candidates for such a list 
prubache analysts say the idea of introducing subjective 
judgments of value into practical investment calculations still 
puzzles or even infuriates a significant segment of the financial 
world 
the idea of the markets the resisters say is not to honor 
ideals or good intentions but to reward business ventures that 
demonstrate their value through the objective measures of 
profitability and growth 
to skew the markets through aesthetic or moral judgments they 
argue risks damaging the effectiveness of american business in a 
coldblooded world marketplace 
on top of that they contend it is a mistake to think that 
hardheaded investors must be hardhearted as well 
as the investment advisory service smart money has urged 
invest your money for maximum gains then if you wish use some 
of your profits to aid causes you consider socially responsible 
through contributions and gifts 
with that approach the firm contends your assistance to 
causes you consider socially desirable will be direct and more 
likely to bring beneficial results 
at the moment however the debate seems increasingly academic 
if demand keeps growing for socially based investment services 
reinforced by such things as laws covering public pension funds it 
seems certain that someone on wall street will hasten to meet it 
as another prudentialbache analyst mark melcher puts it 
like it or not social investing will be around for a while 
whether you are adamantly against the trend a reluctant 
participant view the whole thing as a marketing tool or welcome 
it for personal reasons

she was the juliet of her generation in 
shakespeares drama of starcrossed lovers and at age 19 shared 
limelight with charlie chaplin 
now after a 13year absence claire bloom has returned to the 
london stage affirming her commitment to a profession she calls 
the only thing i could have done 
i loved the makebelieve side of acting i still do i like 
being somebody else she said its given me a whole life ive 
traveled ive met people a whole world was opened for me chaplin 
opened it really and gave me a different life 
in 1951 bloom was chosen from obscurity to play the limpidly 
beautiful suicidal dancer in chaplins limelight it was one 
of those rare debut performances that guarantee stardom 
she is 59 now and has moved regularly between movies and the 
stage america and her native england she is on home turf once 
again doing a play by henrik ibsen with whose work she remains 
identified 
through march 24 she is starring at north londons almeida 
theater in when we dead waken ibsens heavily symbolic and 
rarely performed final play written in 1899 
bloom plays the spectral irena an aging beauty who appears 
shrouded in white to haunt the sculptor rubek whose masterwork 
she inspired ages ago 
with rubek played by norwegian actor espen skjonberg she 
embarks on a lethal erotic gavotte that takes them up a mountain 
peak in the last of three acts there they meet their shared fate 
in an accident that paradoxically seems inevitable given the 
tragic momentum of the play 
this is the most difficult part ive ever played she says 
i knew the play and id always thought it rather wonderful but 
like any play you know it in a kind of abstract form 
still one wonders what compels an internationally acclaimed 
actress to work in a 303seat fringe theater for a scant 165 
pounds about 280 a week 
i just had a picture of an extraordinary play and an 
extraordinary character which she is she explains 
during lunch at an italian restaurant near her chelsea house 
blooms natural beauty is shadowed by tenseness the opening 
performance two days earlier had been shaky other cast members 
flubbed lines and she felt the production was insufficiently 
rehearsed 
reviews were mixed jack tinker in the daily mail praised the 
actress stirring account of a life sucked dry but john gross 
in the sunday telegraph said he could never quite believe in her 
as an avenging fury 
bloom is not eager to dwell on reviews theyre an unbearable 
torment to read an unbearable torment not to read 
she last appeared on the london stage opposite daniel massey in 
a 1977 revival of ibsens rosmersholm and she was a notable 
nora in a dolls house on both sides of the atlantic 
why the passion for ibsen 
she recalls discovering his plays in her teens it didnt take 
much brain to know one was seeing a great playwright they had an 
enormously strong effect on me then 
bloom is choosy shed rather not act than accept a role she 
doesnt like 
i very systematically built a career she reflects i was 
extremely careful guided by my mother you only do whats 
firstclass she said 
bloom was born in london to a peripatetic family of jewish 
immigrants she left school at 14 and just three years later was 
playing ophelia to paul scofields hamlet at stratforduponavon 
her west end debut came alongside john gielgud and richard 
burton in the ladys not for burning followed by the first of 
several juliets a role that she recalls acting out of her own 
romantic longing 
she gladly left england you cant imagine what it was like 
gray emotionally gray and wellmannered to the point of 
suffocation 
her breakthrough came with limelight in which chaplin 
dropped the littletramp role to play a failed vaudeville clown who 
helps a young dancer overcome paralysis 
in her 1982 autobiography bloom described her happiness working 
in limelight 
i had been playing out a girlhood dream inspired by my broken 
family the dream of the fairy godfather 
she went on to act in such movies as the brothers karamazov 
the spy who came in from the cold charly and look back 
in anger the film of the john osborne play that unleashed the 
angryyoungman phase of british drama 
in 1974 she starred in an eightmonth west end run of a 
streetcar named desire which left her she says an absolute 
wreck by the end 
she brought her skills as a tragic actor to british tv as the 
coolly elegant lady marchmain in brideshead revisited and the 
cancerridden american poet joy davidman in shadowlands in 
1987 she was the wellheeled suburbanite whose husband contracts 
aids in intimate contact 
that year she kept unexpected company as shashi kapoors 
sadeyed lover in stephen frears sammy and rosie get laid 
it was different very different she said of the films 
controversial look at the underside of thatcherera britain it 
certainly showed lots of parts of london id never seen before 
and am not terribly keen to see again 
she was less pleased with her role as martin landaus passive 
withdrawn wife in last years woody allen film crimes and 
misdemeanors which has received three academy award nominations 
he could have made her interesting but he wasnt interested 
in her she said i thought it would be interesting to work 
with woody but i never spoke to him he doesnt speak 
midway through the interview blooms demeanor changes markedly 
in walks novelist philip roth her longtime companion and she 
becomes warmer and more relaxed hey she exclaims excitedly 
clapping her hands 
roth preparing a trip to czechoslovakia has stopped in for a 
mineral water on his way to a travel agent 
theirs is an intensely private relationship roth wont talk 
while the tape recorder is on and after he leaves bloom moves the 
conversation to her daughter anna 30 a rising opera singer who 
is fresh from an amsterdam engagement in mozarts cosi fan 
tutte 
i love the fact that she has a totally different career to me 
but one that interests me enormously bloom says im known 
among her friends as the biggest backstage mother i make it my 
business to see everything she does 
anna was born of blooms 10year marriage to actor rod steiger 
her second marriage to new york producer hillard elkins was 
shorterlived and she has lived with roth for 15 years 
the main men in her life have all been american but her heart 
resides in london the place i fled from in the 50s doesnt 
exist anymore she said 
its a wonderful place to live now i never really left

the nbc miniseries phantom of the opera 
shouldnt be confused with the hit musical selling out in london 
new york and los angeles though both adaptations first were 
conceived as stage musicals 
playwright arthur kopit author of the tony awardwinning 
musical nine came up with a play eight years ago about the 
mysterious masked figure who haunts the paris opera house he 
wrote it in collaboration with composerlyricist mauron yeston and 
geoffrey holder was to direct 
but andrew lloyd weber was the first to launch his version of 
gaston lerouxs classic novel of horror and passion 
kopits twopart fourhour phantom of the opera will be 
broadcast sunday and monday starring burt lancaster as the former 
theater manager charles dance as the phantom teri polo as 
christine ian richardson as the new theater manager andrea 
ferreol as the opera prima donna and adam storke as the count 
twotime oscar winner tony richardson directed on location in paris 
it took me about a year to come up with an approach i liked 
kopit said i read the novel and i looked at lon chaneys 1925 
movie there were two other versions beside that i looked at those 
to see what they did each has a fundamentally different approach 
from the one i take 
they all begin with the phantom involved with christine but 
you never know how it began i had to see what attracted him to 
her 
kopit is best known as a tonynominated playwright whose other 
works include wings indians and oh dad poor dad 
mamas hung you in the closet and im feeling so sad but he also 
wrote the miniseries hands of a stranger and several tv movies 
hes even written two sitcom scripts 
hes working now on an abc miniseries and a new musical based on 
the scarlet pimpernel for an april 1991 broadway opening and is 
adapting wings for the hallmark hall of fame series 
after writing hands of a stranger for nbc the network asked 
if there was anything else he wanted to do he sent them lerouxs 
novel and suggested a twopart miniseries there was some 
reluctance after the weber musical opened but kopit overcame it 
theres not a clue in the story as to why the phantom fell in 
love kopit said i had to see why he puts his own life in 
jeopardy for this girl the old theater manager has a relationship 
with him in the book but i made him his father i wanted the 
phantom to have always lived in the opera house the phantom falls 
in love with christine because of her voice 
this is a beauty and the beast story its also a mixture of 
cinderella and faust its a story in which the image more so 
than the execution has captured the publics imagination it 
reminds us of dreams 
kopit says its not an accident the story takes place in an 
opera house calling an opera dreamland compared to the realism 
of the dramatic theater 
the phantom is the serpent who is forbidden and dangerous and 
alluring he said the opera represents beauty the phantom 
represents the beast when you have perfection you also have a dark 
side not far behind the phantom is not a villain but the ultimate 
outcast with an underlying sexuality 
kopit called it a victorian story 
i dont think it would work today he said you have to 
have women swoon this figure lurking near christine is like cathy 
and heathcliff in wuthering heights he sweeps away the girl like 
the phantom and we know hes in trouble the fun in writing this is

there may be some cracks in the voter 
coalition that has enabled republicans to win five of the last six 
presidential elections but gop consultants say theyre not worried 
yet 
they dont think the democrats will be able to take advantage of 
a split among gop factions any time soon 
at a forum sponsored by the progressive policy institute six 
republican consultants analysts and political scientists said 
strains within their party notably on abortion may send some 
voter blocs away mad 
but they said the democrats are likely to remain a party of 
liberal positions and candidates reducing the risk of defections 
or disinterest among gop voting blocs 
david keene chairman of the american conservative union said 
the glue of the movement was opposition to communism and as 
the easing cold war has made that less important differences on 
other points show more clearly 
pollster lance tarrance said antitax antiabortion 
anticommunist positions helped the republicans assemble their 
presidential coalition beginning with white voters in the south in 
the 1960s adding ethnic and roman catholic groups in the 70s and 
gaining among youthful voters in the 80s 
he said the national democrats treat the changes as though they 
were temporary and continue to cater to liberal blocs in their 
nomination campaigns producing candidates who cant fashion a 
majority in general elections 
but kevin phillips president of the american political research 
corp said i think that theres a lot of vulnerability in the 
coalition at this point 
phillips said some of the emotional symbolic issues that helped 
president bush in 1988 things like the pledge of allegiance and 
prison furloughs are echoes of the old southern strategy he helped 
fashion more than 20 years ago 
these issues are beginning to weaken he said the 
republican coalition is beginning to fragment on cultural issues 
phillips said he thinks it will unravel in the 1990s which 
shouldnt be surprising because the coalitions roots can be traced 
back more than 25 years historically that has been about the life 
span of dominant coalitions in presidential politics 
but in the near term the republican analysts see a severe 
economic downturn as the one issue that could undercut a gop 
ticket phillips said the democrats lost touch with the average 
voter on social issues but they have not lost touch with the 
average american economically 
economics is the common concern of the theorists and of 
practical politicians looking toward president bushs reelection 
campaign in 1992 bushs men think he will be almost invulnerable 
unless there is a major slump in the economy 
but republican differences do show on some other problem issues 
notably abortion 
paul weyrich president of the free congress foundation said 
the republicans began building their national coalition when they 
shed their old image as the party of elites and country clubs he 
said that old style is reemerging now because party leaders are 
taking positions that offend the religious right 
bush is firmly opposed to abortion but he and other party 
leaders have said there is room for republican differences on the 
issue leeway that angers the hardline antiabortion groups who 
resist any compromise 
doug bailey a veteran republican campaign consultant who now 
publishes a daily political newsletter said abortion could become 
a major republican problem even in advance of a 1992 platform 
fight should a vacancy occur on the supreme court 
bush almost certainly would appoint an abortion foe and the 
democratic senate just as surely would refuse to confirm one a 
nomination battle would focus attention on an issue republican 
leaders would prefer to play down 
weyrich said grass roots conservatives also were outraged when 
gop leaders agreed with the democrats to shelve congressional pay 
raises as a 1990 issue he said that added to the impression that 
the elite was back in charge 
fault lines are definitely there weyrich said but he said 
the democrats would have to nominate a centrist for president in 
order to take advantage of it and thats unlikely 
i think it will be very hard for the republicans to lose 
presidential elections in the foreseeable future said jeane 
kirkpatrick former united nations ambassador and former democrat 
if there are fault lines in the republican party you can 
hardly shout across the divide in the democratic party 
the republican panelists consensus on the future 
the democrats are bound up in presidential nomination reform 
rules that are likely to keep pushing their presidential nominees 
to the left in the primary election season making them vulnerable 
in general elections 
neither party is producing a real vision of the american 
future and no powerful new issues loom although trade and 
protectionism could become one except for abortion this is 
going to be a pretty boring era for the next few elections 
tarrance said 
political cycles notwithstanding the status quo is likely to 
hold unless there is an economic crisis as long as you dont 
have a very clear sense of where you want to go george bush is an 
excellent president phillips said

more babies seem to be dying from exposure to crack cocaine in 
the womb alarming health officials who fear they might be losing 
the battle against infant mortality in drugplagued inner cities 
after decades of progress infant mortality rates have begun to 
creep upward in new york city washington dc and some other 
spots where the use of crack has skyrocketed 
researchers are cautious about blaming crack but say the 
evidence is mounting 
there are lots of conjectures said dr joel klienman an 
analyst with the national center for health statistics but 
one likely culprit especially for the black population is 
cocaine 
the national commission to prevent infant mortality an 
independent panel that has members from both parties in congress 
warned last wednesday that crack use was one of several reasons why 
infant deaths were likely to rise sharply in the 1990s 
progress in reducing infant mortality has stalled said sen 
lawton chiles of florida the commissions chairman in the 1990s 
we may see more infants die per year than the 40000 we now lose 
before their first birthdays 
by now nearly everyone has seen television pictures of 
premature infants some scarcely larger than a doctors hand 
writhing in what seems to be the agony of drug withdrawal 
research suggests these babies of crack addicts are not actually 
addicted says dr ira j chasnoff president of the national 
association for perinatal addiction and research 
they do however suffer from a distressing array of brain 
disorders and medical problems that appear to stunt their 
development for years if not permanently drugabuse expert 
douglas besharov of the american enterprise institute a washington 
think tank calls these children the new biounderclass 
sometimes their ailments are fatal 
cocaine constricts the bodys blood vessels including those in 
the placenta the maternal organ that supplies a fetus with its 
oxygen and nourishment 
so when a substance disrupts this vascular system it sort of 
messes up the pipes to put it in simple terms said dr leah 
ziskind new jerseys acting health commissioner its like you 
have a break in the plumbing 
that she said can cause very very serious problems for a 
babys brain development and also frequently prompts premature 
labor some women have even been reported to use crack to induce 
labor prematurely 
now researchers are beginning to discover that crackexposed 
infants also appear to be unusually prone to sudden infant death 
syndrome which kills babies mysteriously in their first months of 
life 
chasnoff said other factors besides crack could play a part in 
the sudden deaths the poverty the lifestyle factors the 
adolescent mothers the cigarette smoking but crack is 
indisputably part of the mix he said 
no national statistics document the problem nor does any state 
keep thorough records on the number of cocaineexposed babies who 
die but the little information that is available is disturbing 
in massachusetts the state department of social services keeps 
a tally of those infant deaths that raise suspicion among hospital 
officials there were 24 such deaths in 1988 at least seven of 
which involved cocaine use by the mothers the number nearly 
doubled to 43 in 1989 with at least 17 involving maternal cocaine 
use 
it seems to go along with the whole crack cocaine epidemic 
department spokeswoman lorraine carli said it seems to have 
become the drug of choice for women 
city officials in washington dc announced last september 
that infant mortality jumped nearly 50 percent in the first half of 
1989 they directly blamed crack cocaine the citys new infant 
mortality rate was 323 deaths for every 1000 live births triple 
the national average and worse than the averages in chile jamaica 
and panama among many other places 
in new york city which keeps exhaustive records on infant 
mortality and drug use the number of infant deaths began rising in 
1985 the year the crack epidemic began in earnest that year 5 
percent of city birth certificates mentioned cocaine use by the 
mother by 1988 the figure was 21 percent the mortality rate for 
babies of cokeusing mothers has been put at 35 per 1000 roughly 
triple the citywide average and almost four times the national 
average 
infant mortality also has been rising in new jersey where 10 
cities were targeted in 1985 for special prenatal attention but 
even in these healthy mother healthy baby cities the infant 
mortality rate rose the last two years we suspect very strongly 
that our increases in infant mortality in 88 and 89 are due to 
the drugabusing pregnant woman and especially her preference for 
crack ziskind said 
crackrelated infant deaths are setting off alarms in other 
states including ohio michigan new mexico and rhode island and 
some states are beginning to consider changes in birth and death 
reports to gauge the extent of the problem more accurately 
solutions are as elusive as an end to drug abuse itself but 
health officials increasingly are looking to onestop shopping 
clinics that would combine drug treatment with prenatal and 
obstetric care the idea is to provide an easy alternative for 
women who might be reluctant to go to several clinics for pregnancy 
care 
i think the most important thing we can do is set up a system 
that allows women as soon as they are pregnant to come in and be 
counseled by healthcare professionals ziskind said i think 
we should use this time in a womans life to let her focus on her 
body and her baby 
it is she said an opportunity to capture drugabusing 
women and maybe just maybe get them to change

when joshua arrived at new england medical center 
senior nurse sharon hill could have held him in her hand he was 
three months premature and weighed two pounds and because of 
cocaine he was suffering 
the cocaine addiction was his mothers but joshua still pays 
for it after three months in the hospital 
cocaine pushed him into the world so early and illequipped that 
he was immediately hooked up to a ventilator and feeding tubes and 
had four cardiac monitor electrodes taped to his chest 
although babies with breathing tubes cant make any noise when 
they cry hill says sometimes you can see an expression that 
they are crying 
last year about 10 percent of the cocaine babies born in 
massachusetts died some who survived suffered strokes or 
intestinal failure when cocaine constricted their tiny arteries 
but most of their problems result from premature birth 
experts now are investigating the possibility that problems 
among cocaineexposed babies might not show up until years 
later 
cocaine might damage the infants central nervous systems but 
its difficult to study their longterm prospects because 
researchers find it hard to separate the effects of cocaine 
exposure in the womb from poor parenting said barry zuckerman 
director of development and behavioral pediatrics at boston city 
hospital 
we dont know what effect it has on the developing brain or 
how it may later affect behavior zuckerman said 
a study by the national association for perinatal addiction 
research and education has shown it takes three months before 
cocaine babies weigh as much as drugfree infants and two years for 
head circumference a measure of brain development to match that 
of babies not exposed to cocaine 
the most important thing is extreme prematurity 10 weeks 
12 weeks 15 weeks said benjamin sachs chairman of obstetrics 
and gynecology at bostons beth israel hospital a baby thats 12 
weeks premature may remain in hospital three months and cost 
100000 thats a serious public health problem 
babies born with cocaine in their systems may alternately be 
lethargic and overstimulated or given to inconsolable crying sachs 
said 
the study showed infants remained irritable for six to eight 
weeks placing a heavy burden on drugaddicted mothers 
were concerned that the mothers may get turned off by their 
babies zuckerman said 
the critical question might be to whom is this child born and 
what kind of mothering is going on in that environment said 
sachs who argues that it illustrates the need for more treatment 
for female addicts 
there are very few places in massachusetts where women who are 
addicted can get help and there are long waiting lists he said 
zuckerman described it as a pay now or pay later situation 
were impressed by how hard the mothers work to stop taking 
drugs and be a good mother he said we dont have enough drug 
treatment programs for women if you pay later you spend the money 
and have a damaged baby

here are some facts and figures about lyme disease 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the federal centers for disease control said 4572 cases were 
reported in 1988 and 2368 were reported in 1987 in 1982 just 
492 cases were reported 1989 figures are not yet available 
new york accounted for 56 percent of the 1988 cases and 90 
percent of the cases have occurred in the northeast 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
wear protective clothing such as long pants and use insect 
repellent to guard against the ticks that carry lyme disease 
in areas with a high concentration of the disease clear yards 
of leaves and debris that can harbor ticks or rodents that also 
carry the disease avoid brush when possible stay on trails 
after being outdoors inspect your body for ticks if you find 
one remove it with the fingers or tweezers and apply antiseptic 
the sooner a tick is removed the better they must feed 24 to 48 
hours to transmit lyme disease 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in twothirds of cases the first sign is a red rash often in 
the shape of a bulls eye that develops days or weeks after a 
tick bite alternatively early symptoms may be vague aches and a 
lowgrade fever 
next comes arthritislike pain in the joints or nerve damage 
causing pain or numbness 
lyme disease also can mimic many other diseases 
blood tests for the disease will not show results for four to 
six weeks after a bite

antibiotics if not caught early treatment can be difficult 
requiring even intravenous antibiotics

lyme disease was identified in 1975 by dr allen steere then of

you might not lick yours chops at the 
sight of ground beef mixed with beaver meat and a dash of powdered 
eggs 
but then again youre probably not pulling a 90pound sled and 
sleeping on hay the sled dogs of montanas 500mile race to the 
sky are a different breed when it comes to dinner 
mushers differ in the diets they prefer for their dogs each of 
which eat on average about six pounds of food a day while racing 
commercial brands are common but the supplements arent 
says handler kathy donars of ely minn whose husband kerry was 
one of the mushers in the weeklong race but didnt finish dogs 
become accustomed to getting a certain meal some get picky if they 
have to try something else but most eat what we give them 
when the dogs come off a long stretch of trail the donars 
prefer to mix strips of liver with water as a water substitute 
it gives them more nutrients that way mrs donars said 
then well mix some ground chicken with our commercial dog food 
and let them eat 
musher bruce graham of seeley lake prefers to feed his dogs red 
meat beaver 
we brought close to 200 pounds of beaver meat with us said 
rollin welch handler for graham who also didnt finish the race 
its a highprotein meat they love it on the trail bruce feeds 
them fish and chicken patties a little something we made up its 
a great snack for the trail 
electrolytes are a staple used by most mushers and according to 
welch they most closely resemble the thirst quencher gatorade 
veterans on the trail including handler terry adkins of sand 
coulee prefer a base commercial dog food mixed with powdered foods 
powdered fish powdered eggs and some good old ground chicken 
and beef are excellent dog food supplements adkins said its 
important to get water into them while theyre racing so we put 
the same supplement into their water 
adkins has raced sled dogs since 1972 he first ran the iditarod 
in alaska in 1974 and will be making his 16th trip this year 
this is the first year weve used this kind of supplement 
said adkins whose 21yearold son christopher finished sixth in 
the race to the sky his first sled dog race i just hope the 
dogs continue to look good theyre eating right thats for sure 
other mushers prefer to feed their dogs right out of the bag 
we open our bag of commercial dog food measure out how much 
they need and let them gobble it up said handler laurie 
beckstrom of kalispell whose husband jack came in second 
well feed them every eight hours 
well add some melted chicken fat on the food too we usually 
add a little something into their water in the cold weather they 
wont drink plain tap water they enjoy baited water and ours is a 
secret 
for others the secret is already out 
we use high grade commercial feed plus a lot of other 
supplements that are being used by other teams said ed borden of 
clam gulch alaska who was dog handler for dean osmar the 
firstplace finisher the main thing in race conditions like this 
year is liquids theres meat in our water and electrolytes keep 
their salt up

central washington universitys 
talking chimpanzees will get a new home next year and 
fundraising efforts are under way to give them a place to play as 
well 
while the legislature has authorized a 15 million home for the 
chimps lawmakers did not finance an outdoor play and exercise area 
for the five chimpanzees the first in the world to learn human 
sign language 
researchers roger and debbi fouts said they need to raise 
650000 to build a secure outdoor area that will provide the 
chimps with sunlight swinging and climbing apparatus and other 
benefits 
the drive began in seattle in january with a fundraiser with 
gov booth gardner as host the fouts also intend to solicit 
donations by mail 
the new home and play area are essential for the chimps who 
have been caged on the third floor of the universitys psychology 
building for years fouts said 
washoe hasnt seen the sun in 10 years fouts said washoe 
was the first animal ever to learn a human language 
the research has been under way at the school since 1980 when 
fouts moved to this small central washington farm and college town 
from the university of oklahoma 
financing has been a constant struggle 
while fouts is paid as a faculty member of the university ms 
fouts is a volunteer and chimp care depends on the help of up to 
15 students the university provides just 1000 a year for the 
chimps care 
financial help comes from 500 subscribers who pay 25 a year for 
the fouts newsletter much of the chimps food is donated by 
grocery stores and farmers fouts said 
pizza parlors occasionally donate pizzas washoe doesnt like 
pepperoni ms fouts said 
the new building was needed because the constant cleaning of the 
animals cages was causing water damage to the psychology building 
and their noise disrupted classes 
the new building set for groundbreaking this spring and 
completion next year also will bring better public access to the 
chimps which the fouts hope will increase donations 
the chimps weigh up to 150 pounds and have the strength of eight 
grown men so security is important people in ellensburg 
wouldnt want them walking into their houses and looking in the 
refrigerator fouts said 
the fouts research is behavioral not biomedical so a good 
environment for the chimps is essential to good results 
were hoping this gives them more things to sign about and 
more interesting things to do fouts said the ability to swing 
more freely by the arms will also make the chimps happier he said 
to the fouts the washoe project is like the moon shot of the 
behavioral sciences

south florida bird watchers are 
being asked to report sightings of the endangered everglades kite 
the everglades kite also is known as the snail kite because it 
exclusively eats apple snails a wetlands mollusk whose survival is 
threatened by drought 
we want to identify important wetlands where the kites are so 
the state can possibly protect the site said wildlife biologist 
mark maffei of the loxahatchee national wildlife refuge which has 
asked for reports of sightings 
the kite is 15 inches tall with a wingspan of 45 inches males 
are slate gray and females are dark brown with white mottling they 
also have a white band on the tips of their tails 
if wetlands dry up and deprive the birds of the snails the 
kites will travel far from their nests in search of food and will 
not return 
they just abandon their young said jim rodgers a biologist 
for the florida game and fresh water fish commission they wont 
nest on dry ground 
the kites prime habitat and nesting area are everglades water 
conservation areas in western palm beach broward and dade 
counties these sites are parched by a severe drought that has 
forced residential water restrictions 
and were just getting into the dry season said burkett 
neely manager of the refuge it was bad last year it could be 
worse this year 
a midwinter survey found 464 snail kites foraging in marshes 
from central florida to the tip of the peninsula in everglades 
national park that was 36 fewer than the previous years count 
rodgers said 
the wildlife refuge has become a clearinghouse for reports of 
snail kite sightings the birds have been found along canals 
flooded farm fields or wetland pockets as they scatter out of the 
driedout everglades

the european southern observatory which 
has extensive experience making photographic plates of the heavens 
will produce copies of palomar observatorys definitive atlas of 
the northern sky 
the 48inch oschin telescope at palomar located on a 
mountaintop in eastern san diego county has been used exclusively 
since 1986 for a decadelong effort to take detailed photographs of 
all portions of space above the northern hemisphere 
the project known as the second palomar observatory sky survey 
will yield 2682 photographic plates that will serve as the basic 
astronomical guide to the northern skies for decades to come 
said robert finn spokesman for the california institute of 
technology which owns palomar 
the plates must be reproduced for sale to major research 
observatories but caltech hasnt done such work since palomars 
first northern sky survey was conducted in the 1940s and 1950s 
the staff of the eso headquartered near munich west germany 
recently produced plates of southern hemisphere sky surveys made in 
the 1970s by its observatory in la silla chile and by the 
angloaustralian observatory in australia 
so caltech officials decided the european southern observatorys 
staff would be able to make highquality plates less expensively 
keeping costs as low as possible robert j brucato palomars 
assistant director said 
under an agreement between caltech and eso the european 
organization will reproduce palomars sky atlas in two forms glass 
plates and film transparencies 
brucato said the cost depends on the number of purchasers but a 
set of the glass plates probably would cost several hundred 
thousand dollars while a set of transparencies likely would cost 
tens of thousands of dollars

researchers are looking for former skin cancer 
patients in georgia for a study on the role of selenium in 
prevention of the disease 
the georgia dermatology and skin cancer center is taking part in 
a program called nutritional prevention of skin cancer said 
mary reid project coordinator of the research sponsored by the 
arizona college of medicine and the american cancer society 
selenium a trace mineral found most often in volcanic soil is 
passed to humans through food meats and grains she said data 
from studies around the world show that cancer is more common in 
areas where selenium levels are lower selenium is found in only 
very low levels in georgia soil 
the mineral helps protect cells from structural changes ms 
reid said there also has been evidence that selenium helps 
stimulate the immune system 
a total of 1700 patients in the selenium research project come 
from clinics in georgia connecticut florida north carolina and 
south carolina 
the macon study group is the largest with 500 people ms reid 
said but more participants are needed 
participants must have no history of kidney or liver problems 
as very large doses of selenium have been found to cause liver 
problems selenium otherwise has few side effects 
to qualify for the study the person must have had basal 
cell or squamous cell carcinoma in the past and a recent bout with 
skin cancer within the last 12 months as well said billie l 
jackson a dermatologist in the macon center 
squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common form of skin 
cancer affecting 80000 to 100000 people a year with about 2000 
deaths reported according to the american cancer society 
excessive sun exposure is the major factor associated with this 
type of cancer

a threeyear clock starts ticking today for 
harold poling as he takes over as head of the nations 
secondlargest automaker 
poling who becomes chairman and chief executive officer of ford 
motor co set the timer last november when it was announced he 
would replace outgoing chairman donald petersen 
the 64yearold poling a year older than petersen said he 
would be serve for only three years before giving way to another 
ideally youd like to have a ceo with a long future out in 
front of him said auto analyst charles brady of oppenheimer amp 
co of new york 
the transition promises to be a smooth one petersen and poling 
worked closely together through the last decade when ford moved 
from a struggling company that lost 15 billion in 1980 to a 
leaner automaker that posted an industry record 53 billion in 
profit in 1988 
despite its successes ford still must contend with a sluggish 
new car market and toughening competition from japanese makers 
factors that combined to trim the companys profits to 384 
billion last year poling has only three years to face those 
challenges and observers already are speculating on his successor 
edward bowman deputy dean of the wharton school at the 
university of pennsylvania said the decision by ford directors to 
give poling a limited term would imply that they werent quite 
ready in terms of succession planning that they werent ready to 
name somebody else for a normal term 
speculation for a chief executive to lead the company in the 
mid1990s and beyond centers on allan gilmour a ford executive 
vice president who today adds the title of president of the ford 
automotive group 
that seems to be the scuttlebutt right now brady said i 
think that may in fact be the plan 
petersen came up through fords product development ranks 
he has been credited with freeing designers and engineers in the 
early 1980s to work together in developing the ford taurus and 
mercury sable cars of the mid1980s which helped lift ford from 
the financial doldrums 
i really think that petersen made the necessary adjustments in 
the product plan brady said the key addition he made was to 
leave product planning to the product planners 
poling who rose through the automakers financial operations 
would be well served to follow that lead brady said 
i think hes got to challenge product planners with the 
charge that this is a very intensely competitive game he said 
thats all hes got to do in the product area 
bowman agreed 
i think he would be a nut in that threeyear period to mess 
with any product decisions he said 
although poling will have a limited amount of time as chief 
executive he has his work cut out for him 
the us auto industry is at or near the bottom of what some 
analysts have called a recession that began in october companies 
would like to wean american consumers from incentives that have 
become ingrained in car buying and are eating away at corporate 
profits 
the nations big three automakers salesleader general motors 
corp ford and no 3 chrysler corp also are taking steps to 
eliminate costs and streamline operations as they try to hang on to 
market share in the face of stiff competition from japanese models 
both imports and americanmade cars 
that brady said is where poling can leave his mark 
his real test will be in raising the levels of productivity 
brady said if he can follow through with the productivity 
increase while the programs continue in the petersen manner it 
will be one of the best onetwo punches of all time 
poling will become the fourth company chairman not a member of 
the ford family the two fords now in company management are 
cousins william c ford jr 32 and edsel ford ii 41 both 
greatgrandsons of company founder henry ford

media companies hope to stake a claim to a spot 
in the doctors waiting room 
the media venture that produces the lifetime cable network 
became the latest company to try to get in the door when it 
disclosed plans wednesday to offer commerciallysponsored tv 
programs on health care topics 
the onehour programs with nine minutes of ads would be offered 
for replay throughout the day in the waiting rooms of 
pediatricians obstetricians and family practitioners 
officials said the service called healthlink television would be 
distributed on videocassettes to a projected 3000 waiting rooms 
beginning sometime in the apriltojune quarter 
a new program would be distributed every month the venture 
expects the number of participating waiting rooms to reach 20000 
by the end of the first year and ultimately reach 50000 of the 
estimated 68000 multidoctor offices available in those medical 
specialities 
at least two other media companies have been considering similar 
advertisersupported video projects and several are already in 
waiting rooms with magazines designed for young mothers 
their creators are touting them as more efficient than the 
traditional mass media for reaching captive audiences with pitches 
for products ranging from diapers to automobiles 
whittle communications based in knoxville tenn is 
considering making programs on either health care or entertainment 
topics available for use in waiting rooms and recently acquired a 
florida company that was about to launch that type of service 
whittle already publishes six quarterly magazines called special 
reports that are in about 19000 doctors offices 
frederick n doner communications inc of new york has been 
testing what it calls the good health channel in a handful of 
waiting rooms over the past two months family media inc also of 
new york recently launched a magazine specifically targeted at 
women in doctors waiting rooms 
the waiting room is now becoming a cluttered scene for 
advertisers said richard kostrya media services director at the 
advertising agency j walter thompson 
he said a serious unresolved question was whether people in such 
settings are receptive to advertising 
the healthlink television project has the backing of some large 
media companies the venture producing it hearstabcviacom 
entertainment services is jointly owned by hearst corp capital 
citiesabc inc and viacom inc 
the same concern now produces lifetime television a cable 
network aimed at women that is available on systems serving 46 
million households and lifetime medical television which produces 
tv programs for the medical community 
thomas f burchill president and chief executive of 
hearstabcviacom entertainment declined to specify how much the 
creators were prepared to spend on the project but said they had 
deep pockets and would invest the necessary funds to make a 
success of it 
the american academy of pediatrics an organization with 38000 
members has agreed to collaborate on producing programs approve 
all program content and screen the ads in return for an unspecified 
royalty fee pitches for tobacco or prescription drugs will not be 
accepted 
burchill said different programs would be created for each of 
the three medical specialties a typical program would include 
short segments on several topics such as childhood nutrition car 
safety or choosing a day care center 
the venture plans to loan a television set and video player to 
participating physicians who are expected to run the show 
continuously during the work day 
david moore president of healthlink television said ad rates 
would start out at about 500000 a year for a 30second commercial 
in the pediatricians waiting rooms while charges on the programs 
aimed at patients of the family practitioners and obstetricians 
would be about 200000 to 300000 a year 
burchill said his companys experience in producing medical 
programs and the backing of the pediatrics group should help 
healthlink compete with other waiting room services 
but he said advertisers also will get an incentive the others 
cannot offer free ad time on the lifetime cable network if the 
audience for healthlink fails to meet expectations

dart group inc has settled a federal 
complaint alleging it had acted as an investment company because 
its main assets stemmed from the sale of stocks in a series of 
takeover bids for retailing companies 
without admitting or denying wrongdoing dart group agreed on 
wednesday in effect not to buy and sell securities as its primary 
business unless it registers as an investment company 
the securities and exchange commission which as been 
investigating the retailer since 1988 accused dart group in a 
civil complaint in washington federal court of violating securities 
laws by acting as an unregistered investment firm 
the sec charged that since 1984 when it sold off the dart drug 
store chain a majority of the total consolidated assets of dart 
group have been composed of securities 
according to the sec companies that engage primarily in 
trading investing and reinvesting securities constitute investment 
companies that must by law register with the sec 
dart group which is controlled by herbert haft and his son 
robert made a string of hostile attempts for retailers including 
safeway stores inc supermarkets general corp dayton hudson 
corp and most recently a 432 billion bid for kroger co in 
september 1988 
dart group never acquired its targets but the hafts profited 
handsomely from their stock in the companies and earned reputations 
as corporate raiders observers questioned whether they were 
serious about acquiring a retailer 
dart group based in landover md said in a statement it had 
resolved the sec matter and added that it is not now an 
investment company and does not intend to become an investment 
company 
the company said it had 1989 sales of more than 900 million 
from 575 retail stores such as trak auto crown books and shoppers 
food supermarkets dart group said it also has real estate holdings 
rudolph gerlich jr a branch chief with the secs enforcement 
division said the case was significant because it showed that even 
firms with large operating subsidiaries still can be classified as 
investment companies if they meet legal requirements 
gerlich warned other companies that the sec will be looking at 
your assets and your income and if they are primarily securities 
we wont hesitate to more closely scrutinize the company and where 
appropriate to require registration as an investment company 
in october 1988 dart disclosed that the sec was investigating 
whether the firm should be forced to register as a company that 
invests in securities for a pool of small investors 
dart group was never forced to take that step but the hafts 
have not made a hostile bid since then

an investor group with a 726 percent stake in 
harleydavidson inc wants the last us motorcyle maker to get rid 
of its recreational vehicle subsidiary 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission on 
wednesday businessman malcolm i glazer said he sent a letter to 
harleys management suggesting it sell or spin off its holiday 
rambler corp division 
either transaction would allow harleydavidson to concentrate 
its efforts on what it does best manufacturing motorcycles 
glazer said in the feb 26 letter to the milwaukeebased companys 
president richard f teerlink 
the letter suggested a meeting at teerlinks office on march 5 
to discuss the matter 
teerlink rebuffed the request for a meeting 
the future growth of holiday rambler offers a significant 
longterm opportunity for our shareholders he said in a 
statement therefore we believe that holiday rambler should 
remain a part of the company 
glazer an investor and businessman with offices in rochester 
ny and palm beach fla revealed last october that he and 
members of his family had acquired a 624 percent stake in harley 
the nations only remaining motorcycle manufacturer 
at that time glazer said he might seek to acquire a controlling 
interest or sell off all or part of his groups shares 
glazer in 1988 acquired 99 percent of the formica corp at 
12 a share and was rebuffed in a 20ashare buyout offer before 
the laminated products company went private 
in the letter to teerlink glazer disclosed he now holds 726 
percent or 626500 shares of harleys common stock 
glazers letter said he believed harleys common shares would be 
greatly enhanced if the holiday rambler division is divested and 
the proceeds distributed to shareholders as a special dividend or 
the division is spun off as a publicly traded corporation with 
the shares of the new entity being distributed to current 
harleydavidson shareholders 
holiday rambler employs about 2200 in northern indiana and had 
sales of 3519 million 
in 1983 the reagan administration imposed five years of stiff 
tariffs against imported motorcycles that had been beating harleys 
product the tariffs were removed in 1987 after the company 
announced it no longer needed protection

people who live in the shadow of the 
seabrook nuclear power plant say its hard to believe a decision on 
licensing the reactor is at hand 
many are against the plant and say they fear what would happen 
if an accident occurred 
i think its a disgrace said russ arscott a seabrook 
resident for 61 years theres no way to evacuate the area i 
just hope the pipes all hold 
ray colbert moved to hampton beach last year knowing little 
about the plant which he can see across hampton harbor from his 
porch he said he plans to move to florida in may partly because 
of the reactor 
i might stay if that thing wasnt so close he said but 
ive got a fivemonthold daughter i want to get her the hell 
out of here before they fire that thing up 
others look forward to the day the plant finally produces 
electricity 
we need it said thelma grinnell a resident of nearby 
salisbury mass for the past 25 years we need something other 
than fossil fuels were destroying the environment 
the yearsold controversy about licensing centers on federally 
mandated evacuation plans for communities within a 10mile radius 
of the plant including salisbury and five others in massachusetts 
opponents say the area around the plant which is located two 
miles from popular hampton beach and 40 miles north of boston is 
too densely populated to be evacuated safely in an emergency 
anybody whos been in a traffic jam near the plant during 
the summer knows that in a panic situation evacuation would be 
impossible sen gordon humphrey rnh said in a telephone 
interview wednesday 
why should i have to leave everything i worked for and own 
just because of a siren blast from a plant i hate asked herbert 
sanborn a 79yearold seabrook resident 
seabrook proponents including former new hampshire governor and 
now white house chief of staff john sununu say the plans will 
work sununu refused to comment on seabrook this week but his 
support was vocal as governor 
it may be a surprise but we run the analogy of an 
evacuation experiment at 730 each summer day sununu said 
during a 1983 debate at 730 that beach is crowded and at 11 
at night that beach is empty 
although they disagree on licensing opponents and proponents 
agree that the nuclear regulatory commission has taken too long to 
make a decision 
i never thought it would take this long said former gov 
meldrim thomson a seabrook proponent who served from 197379 
if any human being could dream up anything worse they would 
have to work at it thomson said weve been told over and over 
again that weve built the best and safest plant thats ever been 
built its ridiculous that it hasnt been licensed 
veteran antiseabrook protester dianne dunfey was equally 
critical of the nrc but from the other side of the issue 
the nrc is one of the most disreputable of all government 
agencies said dunfey who was released from jail last week after 
serving a fiveday term for refusing to pay a fine following a 
sitin at gov judd greggs office 
it has ignored public input said dunfey who teaches school 
in seabrook it either discarded or amended all of its own 
regulations anytime seabrook couldnt meet one

the struggling house of shearson lehman hutton 
inc said it would lay off 2000 more workers and acknowledged that 
the recession on wall street could cost still more jobs at the 
nations no 2 brokerage 
wednesdays move follows 800 job cuts late last year a senior 
management overhaul and 1 billion in capital infusions by parent 
american express co to prop up the securities companys financial 
position 
shearson president howard l clark jr said the latest 
reductions are part of a broad costcutting program that would save 
the company 400 million a year he said a review of the investment 
banks operations could lead to the elimination of certain 
businesses and the paring down of others 
shearson officials said the latest layoffs which will be 
completed by the end of march would occur in all divisions 
these steps are necessary to position ourselves for longterm 
success in the decade ahead said clark a former american 
express executive who took over shearson last month after the 
ouster of peter a cohen who led the firms bold expansion in the 
1980s 
clark said the cost cutting and business review would result in 
significant onetime charges that would depress firstquarter 
earnings 
as part of the review he said shearson would consider shrinking 
or closing down businesses selling entire units entering 
partnerships in some markets with other wall street firms or 
expanding in some areas 
one potential union reportedly failed wall street sources said 
american express and primerica corp parent of smith barney 
harris upham amp co held talks about merging some areas to improve 
operating efficiency but they ended without a deal this week 
however the new york times reported that talks were continuing 
about a possible merger of shearson and smith barney which would 
create the nations largest brokerage 
under a proposed stockforassets swap primerica would receive 
a large portion of american express stake in shearson and the two 
companies would be partners as parents of the merged brokerages 
the newspaper said citing unidentified people involved in the 
talks 
primerica chairman sanford i weill the man who built up 
shearson in the 1970s and sold it to american express in 1981 
would take over as chairman of shearson the times said 
the new layoffs would reduce shearsons work force to 33500 
from a peak of 46000 in january 1988 the cuts come amid a general 
industry slowdown since the october 1987 stock market crash that 
has cost more than 40000 jobs 
shearson like other firms is readjusting to the new market 
realities said john kriz a securities industry analyst with 
moodys investors service inc 
perrin long of lipper analytical services said he expected 
shearson to cut up to 3000 more jobs this year and reduce its 
reliance on businesses such as investment banking and trading in 
favor of retail brokerage 
the latest cuts came two days after american express said it 
would inject 750 million into shearson to shore up its finances 
following a 250 million infusion in december in return american 
express increased its ownership stake in shearson 
analysts said the injection was designed to quell widespread 
rumors on wall street about shearsons financial condition 
following the recent collapse of drexel burnham lambert inc 
american express had planned to shore up shearsons finances and 
reduce its stake in the brokerage to about 45 percent from 61 
percent under a complex recapitalization plan involving the issue 
of 250 million of new shearson stock but weak market conditions 
forced the company to abandon the offering 
long estimated the new infusion would give american express 
about 72 percent of shearson but he said if shearsons financial 
position improves the parent still would need to consider whether 
to sell the firm spin it off to shareholders or assume 100 percent 
ownership

while environmentalists generally praise the 
criminal indictment of exxon corp in the massive alaskan oil 
spill some are bemoaning the fact that no individual corporate 
officials were charged 
there are some people hiding behind the corporate cloak 
erik olson an attorney for the natural wildlife federation said 
wednesday if you are not punishing the individuals you are only 
punishing some ethereal corporate artificial entity 
but proving criminal legal violations against individuals would 
be much more difficult than bringing charges against the 
corporation and its subsidiary exxon shipping co legal experts 
say 
a corporation doesnt act through one person but may act 
through a combination of individuals so no one of them had a 
requisite criminal intent said norman bernstein a washington 
environmental lawyer who represents large corporations 
the companys failure may be in a sense the failure of the 
system a combination of peoples judgments rather than one 
individual consciously saying i dont really care about the 
intentional grounding of this ship bernstein said 
a federal grand jury in alaska handed up a fivecount criminal 
indictment against exxon on tuesday in the 10milliongallon spill 
by the tanker exxon valdez in alaskas prince william sound on 
march 24 
attorney general dick thornburgh didnt rule out the possibility 
of more charges telling reporters the investigation was 
continuing his statement tuesday indicated that prosecutors may be 
trying to determine if there is evidence to charge individuals 
responsibility often is so fragmented in large corporations that 
it is difficult to prove that a series of individuals knowingly 
committed crimes said judson w starr former head of the justice 
departments environmental crimes unit 
but criminal behavior is easier to prove against corporations 
they can accumulate bits and pieces of knowledge starr said 
to win convictions on the two felony charges it has brought the 
justice department must prove that exxon willfully and 
knowingly failed to ensure the exxon valdez was manned by crew 
members capable of safely operating the tanker 
the ships captain joseph hazelwood is on trial in anchorage 
on state charges arising from the spill including operating a 
vessel while intoxicated 
in the days before tuesdays indictment the justice department 
endured a storm of criticism from alaskan officials and 
environmental groups after reports it was about to reach a 
pleabargain agreement with exxon 
alaskan officials charged the settlement would have compromised 
the states civil suit against the oil company 
but assistant attorney general richard b stewart defended the 
governments handling of the negotiations denying claims that it 
might have agreed to a settlement that would have allowed exxon to 
avoid its responsibility for the cleanup 
in its dealings with exxon over several months the department 
always insisted on a guilty plea to serious charges and very 
very substantial fines entirely unprecedented in the environmental 
context stewart said wednesday 
the proposal was tailored to deal with an unresolved and 
developing situation he said it will be many years before we 
have a full understanding of the extent of the damage 
the government proposed requiring exxon to pay 150 million up 
front to finance pilot restoration projects and environmental 
studies to assess ways of repairing the damage he said 
once that phase was completed exxon also would have been 
required to pay up to 500 million as demanded by federal trustees 
to finish the cleanup stewart said 
if that amount proved insufficient the government would have 
been free after four years to file civil suits to get more money 
the justice department showed the proposal to alaskan officials 
at exxons request because the company did not want to be in a 
position of paying twice for the same cleanup stewart said 
the government made changes to accommodate concerns raised by 
alaska he said adding that the proposal was rejected by both 
alaska and exxon

lee iacocca while president of ford motor co 
tried to stage a coup by saying thenford chairman henry ford ii 
was senile and incapable of running the nations no 2 automaker a 
new book says 
the book by former ford executive walter hayes said iacocca now 
chairman of chrysler corp made the move while ford was traveling 
in china in 1978 later that year iacocca was fired by ford 
grandson of the companys founder became chryslers president and 
rose to chairman in 1979 
the biography of ford who died sept 29 1987 is to be 
published in june review copies of henry a memoir of henry ford 
ii were distributed wednesday 
hayes who retired as vice chairman of ford of europe last year 
said iacocca met with ford directors george bennett and joseph 
cullman and argued that henry still not 60 years of age was 
senile and not up to the job and indicated that there were others 
in the company who shared his opinion 
ford learned of the meeting the book said and did not 
believe it but it took little detective work to persuade him that 
what he had heard was true lee iacocca wanted to take the company 
away from him and more astonishingly seemed to think he could do 
it 
a spokesman for iacocca said the account was untrue iacocca 
could not be reached for comment chrysler spokesman steve harris 
did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment today 
in his accounts of the late 1970s iacocca said his efforts to 
change ford were repeatedly rebuffed by henry ford 
he ford hated firing people according to hayes book 
that is why he did it so badly 
from the day he made up his mind to replace lee it took him 
three years and an act of insubordination to stiffen his sinews 
sufficiently to do the deed

personal income boosted in part by a federal 
employee pay raise rose 08 percent in january while consumer 
spending increased 06 percent the government reported today 
the commerce department said incomes totaled a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 460 trillion after rising 05 percent in 
december 
the january increase was boosted by costofliving adjustments 
to several federal transfer payment programs and by a pay raise for 
federal government employees the department said 
the 36 percent federal pay raise added 35 billion at an 
annual rate to government payrolls 
the january income boost was offset somewhat by an increase in 
personal contributions for social insurance programs and by a 
decrease in subsidy payments to farmers 
consumer spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
360 trillion following a 06 percent gain in december 
consumer spending is watched closely as a barometer of economic 
health because it accounts for about twothirds of the nations 
economic activity 
the report showed that americans incomes after taxes rose 09 
percent up from decembers 04 percent gain 
americans savings rate savings as a percent of disposable 
income rose 59 percent against decembers 55 percent increase 
the key component of the income category wages and salaries 
edged up 162 billion in january following a 168 billion gain in 
december 
payrolls at manufacturing companies hit hardest by the federal 
reserves highinterest policies fell 21 billion after a 200 
million increase in december

the roar of eastern airlines jets overhead means 
harold echols is selling yogurt again 
a year ago echols and his concession stands at atlantas 
hartsfield international airport were hit hard by the eastern 
strike that prompted a temporary shutdown of the airline and took a 
multimilliondollar bite out of the local economy 
the strike by eastern machinists pilots and flight attendants 
which began march 4 1989 emptied all of concourse c and half of 
concourse b at hartsfield 
for echols whose airport international concessions inc runs a 
variety of shops the grounding of eastern translated into an 
immediate 32 percent drop in sales weekly losses exceeding 40000 
and several layoffs through the early months of the strike 
we couldnt do a thing about it echols said just pray 
and look for better times 
now that eastern planes are flying again echols and others at 
the worlds second busiest airport are much happier indeed the 
airport itself has recently reclaimed the second busiest title 
to chicagos ohare international which it briefly surrendered 
in the depths of the strike 
miamibased eastern began rebuilding last fall with hartsfield 
as the center of its operations the pilots and flight attendants 
ended their strike in november for the time being eastern 
concourses are busy again with passengers and employees 
eastern machinists continue to picket at hartsfield a constant 
reminder theyre still on strike but the airport and the city of 
atlanta seem to have withstood the shock 
initially it was a sizable impact but it was very 
shortlived said jim cranford hartsfields business manager 
theyre flying less flights but not that much less than 
prestrike because theyve slowly come back 
cranford said in the three years prior to the strike eastern 
contributed about 25 million annually to the airports operations 
including payments for such things as terminal rental security 
landing fees and insurance now that figure is closer to 22 
million 
atlantabased delta air lines the no 1 carrier at hartsfield 
with about 50 percent of the airports traffic contributes more 
than 30 million annually cranford said 
eastern currently owes the airport about 16 million in 
prestrike bills but that money is frozen because of the airlines 
bankruptcy court proceedings cranford said the airline also owes 
about 11 million for february he said but it has been paying 
bills promptly since starting up after the strike 
the airline says it currently has 270 departures a day out of 
atlanta compared to 289 daily right before the strike 
the worrisome question is will they succeed in the long 
run said airport spokesman john braden 
eastern is so ingrained in atlanta braden said they were 
born here eastern was established here before delta we consider 
them an atlanta airline so wed hate to see them leave from the 
standpoint that theyre ours 
donald ratajczak director of the economic forecasting center at 
georgia state universitys college of business administration said 
the local economy has begun to climb back from the jolt caused last 
spring by the strike which took a big payroll bite worth 700 
million annually 
ratajczak said atlanta hasnt totally recovered 
the new eastern doesnt have the same economic clout as 
before he said but its sure better than it was last march

du pont and the spanish government are to 
invest 1 billion over the next 12 years to build a hightech 
industrial complex in the northern region of asturias under an 
agreement signed thursday 
industry minister claudio aranzadi said spain agreed to put up 
300 million not counting an undisclosed sum by the asturian 
regional government to win the complex which is to employ 1000 
people in the hardpressed region by 2001 
du pont chairman edgar s woolard jr said the complex to be 
inaugurated in 1993 with a 200 billion nomex fiber plant would 
produce a range of chemicals fibers and polymer products for the 
fastgrowing european market 
we will bring some of our highesttechnology most specialized 
products into this site with the objective of supplying the entire 
european market said woolard who signed the agreement with 
aranzadi 
he said the project would further du ponts goal of doubling its 
annual 5 billion european sales of chemicals plastics and fibers 
over the next decade 
both aranzadi and woolard said they expected the eventual 
investment to exceed the agreedupon 1 billion and added the 
presence of du pont would act as a magnet for small and midsized 
companies making finished products 
even without the additional companies du pont iberica chairman 
german lastra said the complex could be expected to indirectly 
create an additional 4000 to 5000 jobs in the area 
the site of the complex is in the tamon valley 6 kilometers 
37 miles from the city of aviles which is near the atlantic 
ocean 
woolard said it would be at least six months before the company 
would decide on the product to follow nomex an aramid fiber used 
in aerospace and protective clothing now made exclusively at a du 
pont plant in richmond virginia 
but he said the companys commitment to the overall project was 
firm 
du pont would not be opening this site if there were any 
possibility that we were going to build nomex and stop it would 
not be of interest to us woolard said 
construction on the nomex plant is to begin in august with 
production expected to start at the start of 1993 woolard said 
the plant is to employ 300 people 
du pont iberica now concentrates mostly on marketing in spain 
and portugal where it employs 300 people and had sales last year 
of 200 million the company said 
in europe du pont employs 20000 people in 14 countries and 
registered 11 billion in sales last year company officials said

an appellate court thursday upheld the 
conviction and stiffened the sentence of refaat elsayed for fraud 
and insider trading in the biggest whitecollar case ever to reach 
a s instead 
of the five years earlier imposed 
the court acquitted gaston portofaix the financial manager of 
el sayeds former company fermenta ab on four counts of swindling 
a district court found elsayed guilty last july on 14 counts of 
swindling investers perjury insider trading and fraud 
he told reporters after thursdays verdict that he was a 
scapegoat for the board of his failed company that and maybe 
the fact that i did not fall on my knees cry and say i have 
wronged forgive me may be the reason why im convicted in this 
way he said 
elsayed who immigrated in 1964 parlayed his 1981 purchase of 
the failing biotechnical company fermenta into a financial empire 
his success began to unravel when it was discovered his claim to 
gave a doctorate degree was phony the disclosure led to a closer 
look at the companys transactions and elsayed was found to have 
put misleading information in annual reports to improve the 
companys profits and credibility

mixed in early trading today on the chicago board of trade after 
rallying in the previous session

mexico bought about 188000 metric tons of us corn overnight 
the wheat market was down slightly pressured by a lack of

the prototype of a revolutionary beech 
aircraft corp plane has met a controversial death in the 
california desert where it emerged 
ignoring the pleas of at least one aviation museum and the 
airplanes designer beech has destroyed the original experimental 
version of its starship business aircraft 
because of its graphite and epoxy allcomposite construction and 
its futuristic design the starship has attracted much attention 
since the original model was unveiled in 1983 
some observers said beechs action reflected the acrimony that 
exists between top beech officials and innovative aircraft designer 
burt rutan who had a major role in the design of the starship and 
whose company built the experimental model 
a demolition crew hired by wichitabased beech broke up the 
85percent scale proofofconcept model of the starship last 
week it was being stored in hangar at the mojave calif airport 
where it was built and first flown in 1983 
a beech official said tuesday dismemberment was the usual fate 
for experimental models 
we were done with it it had served its purpose said 
spokesman mike potts 
the experimental aviation association which maintains an air 
museum in oshkosh wis had asked beech to turn the aircraft over 
to the museum the company refused 
we did not believe the airplane was representative of what we 
ultimately built and certified potts said citing many changes 
in design and construction that were made in the starship before 
commercial production began potts also said the plane was not in 
display condition 
but eaa president tom poberezny said the original starship model 
had historic significance whatever its condition 
in addition to having a major role in the original design 
rutans company scaled composites built the experimental model 
rutan said the subject of what to do with the experimental model 
came up a year ago when beech officials indicated they wanted to 
destroy it 
we got back to them and told them there was nobody here that 
would take a hammer to it rutan said 
when he heard the plane was going to be demolished rutan said 
he talked to beech president max bleck who told me it was none of 
my business 
last fall bleck told one industry trade publication that key 
design and construction problems beech encountered in developing 
the starship for commercial sale were caused largely by inaccurate 
data gleaned from rutans experimental model 
rutan is widely known for his innovative aircraft designs 
including the voyager aircraft that flew around the world nonstop 
without refueling in 1986 and a new allcomposite low cost 
military aircraft designed to provide close air support to ground 
troops the latter plane was unveiled monday 
at one point rutan was an employee of beech which bought 
scaled composites in 1985 and launched several other experimental 
aircraft development programs then in 1988 the year after bleck 
became president of beech the company was sold back to rutan 
waymangordon a firm headed by former beech president james 
walsh now owns scaled composites where rutan continues work on 
experimental aircraft

for woolworth corp americas shopping malls 
are like hundreds of laboratories where it tests ideas to create 
new national chains that specialize in merchandise ranging from 
costume jewelry to running shoes 
the retailer once known for dowdy dimestores that sell trinkets 
and doodads has become the owner of an unusually wide variety of 
stores it isnt just the owner of variety stores 
woolworths powerhouse of more than 40 different specialty 
chains is paced by its allstar foot locker analysts say the 
company may have more of what it will take to outrun the 
competition than any other big american retailer 
a record of 29 straight quarterly profit improvements 
illustrates the new yorkbased companys successful retailing 
science 
this past week woolworth reported record earnings for the fourth 
quarter and full year in 1989 the company earned 329 million or 
511 a share up 14 percent from 288 million or 447 a share 
in 1988 revenue rose 91 percent to 882 billion from 809 
billion 
harold e sells chairman and chief executive officer said 
woolworth will follow a proven formula in trying to keep the streak 
alive 
we feel we know the specialty store business as well if not 
better than any other retailer in the world thats what were 
going to stick to what we know best he said in an interview 
the company constantly examines properties to see if they meet 
the rigorous standards necessary to join the fold maybe taking a 
serious look at a couple a month 
candidates must have the potential to go nationwide and have 
better financial performances than the corporations overall goals 
of a 13 percent return on investment and a 20 percent annual return 
on beginning common equity 
acquisitions in recent years have been small of about 100 
stores or fewer each sells said bigger deals could be forthcoming 
our balance sheet is very strong today we have the capability 
of doing a major acquisition if the opportunity did present 
itself he said 
but dont look for woolworth to go after any department stores 
currently on the block such as the upscale saks or marshall fields 
we have no plans at all to become interested in any of the 
chains that are on the market today said sells 
areas in which woolworth does have interest include anything to 
do with serving an aging population health and beauty aids and 
deep discount drugs where it already has a presence with its rx 
place stores woolworths apparel operations were restructured 
recently to accomodate a possible acquisition 
what woolworth seems to excel at is devising its own concepts or 
spinning strings of small stores by linking existing chains new 
freestanding shops are evolved from individual departments in its 
variety stores 
afterthoughts for example a retailer of costume jewelry 
handbags and accessories is one of woolworths successful 
specialty retailers and it sprung from the variety stores 
champs sports a sporting goods retailer was the offspring of a 
union of two floridabased chains over the past two years 
woolworth has expanded champs to 199 stores from 90 when the match 
was made sells said by 2000 there should be 1000 champs dotted 
throughout almost every major us mall 
landlords love it because of the size sells said noting 
that mall owners who want a sporting goods tenant but dont want to 
commit huge amounts of space prefer to lease to champs which packs 
an assortment of athletic merchandise into about 4500 square feet 
sells an arkansas native who began his retailing career in 1945 
at the kinney shoe corp which woolworth acquired in 1963 said 
the company tries to cultivate an entrepreneurial spirit 
we encourage our operating people in the divisions to come up 
with new ideas a new niche of specialty store retailing that we 
may not be in today but we feel theres an opportunity said 
sells 
if sells and a handful of colleagues approve the concept gets 
tested in this phase woolworth opens about five stores investing 
a couple of hundred thousand dollars in each after a year to two 
woolworth decides whether it has a winner 
for a million dollars we can do this experiment sells said 
we consider that our r and d money a mall he said is like 
our laboratory 
not all experiments work out well last year woolworth gave the 
heaveho to two unprofitable duds frame scene a retailer of 
prints and frames and face fantasies a bargainpriced cosmetics 
outlet 
woolworth makes the best of its flops by refilling the retail 
space with more promising concepts said sells 
kurt barnard a new yorkbased retail consultant said much of 
woolworths strength lies in its clout with landlords and 
streamlined buying ability 
having numerous popular stores within the same mall gives 
woolworth an advantage in negotiating leases having stores with 
overlapping focuses for instance afterthoughts and woolworth 
variety stores makes ordering inventory more efficient and 
economical 
if woolworth has had a weakness it could be the 
fiveandtencent stores operated by the centuryoldplus general 
merchandise division the company has recognized its shortcoming 
about 200 us woolworths were closed in the second half of the 
1980s and many of the rest were renovated and remerchandised 
a smaller leaner version of the variety stores pared to core 
brisk sellers such as budget cosmetics greeting cards candies and 
seasonal items like christmas decorations and halloween masks 
have become familiar mall inhabitants woolworth express shops do 
250 to 300 per square foot in sales and average about 6000 
square feet in size the regular variety stores averaging 17000 
square feet did 110 in sales per square foot in 1988 
in the future one real plus for woolworth is its experience 
outside its home turf it runs stores in australia canada and west 
germany 
woolworth has a toehold in europe that could prove beneficial 
foot locker has the muscle to become the dominant sports shoe chain 
in europe as it is in the united states analysts say 
before world war ii woolworth ran 32 stores in what is now east 
germany and poland the stores were taken over by the government 
sells said the company is awaiting the outcome of march 18 
elections in east germany and if signs are favorable woolworth will 
try to open for business there again 
we have somewhat of an advantage sells said people 
remember the woolworth name

employees rallied in support of their nordstrom 
bosses today and announced a decertification campaign against a 
union that has sued the fashion retailer over alleged violations of 
wage and hour laws 
about 250 people attended the rally outside nordstroms flagship 
store one day after the suit by two united food amp commercial 
workers locals and five current and former nordstrom employees 
the suit was filed in king county superior court on behalf of 
approximately 50000 present and former company workers in 
washington oregon california virginia utah and alaska 
it was the second classaction suit in as many days the first 
was filed by shareholders who said nordstrom should have known the 
wage and hour problems would hurt the companys earnings 
the effort to remove ufcw locals 1001 and 367 as bargaining 
agent for about 1500 nordstrom workers in the seattletacoma area 
was announced today at the procompany rally at westlake plaza 
dozens attending the rally carried signs saying nobody asked 
me i support nordstrom and chanted one two three four no 
more union any more and we love nordstrom 
marv treadwell who works in the mens suits department in 
tacoma said petitions calling for an election on whether to retain 
representation by local 367 had been signed by 40 percent of the 
workers eligible to vote at his store 
greg helean a womens shoe sales clerk in bellevue said 
similar petitions would be circulated starting today in seattle 
on tuesday three nordstrom shareholders filed suit in us 
district court claiming they and other stockholders suffered 
financial losses because of the pay problems and that company 
officers failed to disclose those problems 
nationally nordstrom has 60 stores and employs about 30000 
local 1001 president joe peterson said in a telephone interview 
that union officials were preparing more complaints accusing the 
company of unfair labor practices after getting numerous complaints 
of management pressure to sign petitions supporting nordstrom 
attend the rally and support a decertification campaign 
larry mccarger assistant to the regional director of the 
national labor relations board said the decertification petitions 
probably would not be considered until pending unfair labor 
practice complaints are resolved a process that could take three 
months or longer 
the board also could dismiss the petitions if they are found to 
be the result of company violations of labor laws or regulations 
mccarger said 
nordstrom has a nearlegendary reputation for customer service 
with polite and attentive sales clerks a noquestionsasked return 
policy and personal notes from employees to good customers 
but on feb 15 the washington department of labor and 
industries ruled nordstrom had violated state laws by failing to 
pay some employees for time worked outside normal working hours 
the state acting on a ufcw complaint said workers had not been 
properly compensated for such things as attending meetings 
delivering merchandise to other stores and customers doing 
inventory work or writing thankyou notes 
in releasing its annual earnings monday nordstrom said it had 
made a 15 million provision for expected back pay claims by 
employees and adopted a procedure to handle the claims the charge 
against fourthquarter earnings was cited by the company as one 
reason why profits fell 34 percent in the period ending jan 31 
peterson called the 15 million too little and threatened the 
suit if nordstrom failed to negotiate a backpay settlement with 
the union 
nordstrom said claims forms had been sent to sales clerks in 
states other than washington in washington the forms must be 
reviewed by the states labor office and by the two union locals

perrier will unveil plans to relaunch its sparkling 
water worldwide next week the company said thursday after giving 
soccer fans a sneak preview of bottles filled since benzene 
contamination prompted a global recall two weeks ago 
anne lamour a spokeswoman for source perrier sa refused to say 
whether new cases of the popular drink would be shipped around the 
world simultaneously or sent a few at a time to the 120 countries 
affected by the recall 
no specific date has been set for the announcement of the plan 
and details of new production methods 
the company has increased production at perriers spring at 
vergeze in southern france but mrs lamour declined to say whether 
160 million new bottles had been filled to replace recalled stocks 
perrier had issued a statement on monday that its water could 
return to stores within two months once the company implemented 
new procedures to prevent a recurrence of the contamination 
perrier withdrew 72 million bottles from the united states 
markets in early february after traces of benzene were discovered 
in perrier samples from several markets the recall was expanded 
worldwide on feb 14 after contamination was found in other 
countries 
the naturally occuring benzene entered perriers bottling line 
when workers failed to replace a filter carrying carbon dioxide gas 
from the underground spring to the bottling plant executives said 
about 22000 soccer fans got the first public glimpse of perrier 
bottled since the recall during a soccer match wednesday between 
france and west germany 
company repesentatives displayed two cases of the pearshaped 
1liter bottles with green letters reading nouvelle production 
but the water was not for sale 
when the recall was announced perrier executives said it might 
take 2 months to restock shelves with untainted water 
mrs lamour said original estimates have proven correct that the 
recall would put a 35 million dent in perriers profits 
perrier sent a telex to domestic distributors last week saying 
they would receive new bottles march 1 but mrs lamour said that 
date has been pushed back to at least next week 
the french recall has been voluntary the company asked 
distributors to return the bottles to vergeze for cleaning and 
refilling or to destroy them on site 
mrs lamour said about 48 million of the 50 million bottles on 
french shelves before the recall have been accounted for with a 
quarter of those refilled

the government said thursday it would not pursue a 
criminal prosecution in connection with the 1985 takeover of 
harrods owner house of fraser plc by the alfayed brothers 
the decision by the serious fraud office and the director of 
public prosecutions comes after a 20month investigation 
it was a major setback for roland tiny rowland the lonrho 
plc chairman who was a rival bidder for harrods he has waged a 
long expensive and very public campaign to have the 615 
millionpound 1 billion takeover reversed 
at one point during the bitter feud house of fraser chairman 
mohamed alfayed said only god would take the worldrenowned 
department store away from him 
the authorities also said they had dropped their objection to 
the publication of a report resulting from a department of trade 
and industry investigation into the takeover 
trade secretary nicholas ridley said in a written reply to a 
question in the house of commons that he would publish the report 
on wednesday i do not intend to take any further action he 
said 
lonrho said thursday that it welcomed what it called the 
overdue decision to publish the report when the public and 
the city sees the contents of the report there will be a demand 
for action lonrho is not permitted to comment on the report until 
it is published lonrho will then make its views clear 
the city is londons financial district 
lonrho which has failed in its repeated attempts to have the 
takeover referred to the monopolies and mergers commission had 
pressed for the release of the report which it says supports its 
criticisms of the alfayeds 
lonrho repeatedly has alleged that the alfayeds misrepresented 
their background and wealth to win harrods allegations which they 
have denied 
a year ago lonrho published what it said were extracts from the 
trade departments report in a special midweek edition of its 
sunday newspaper the observer the trade department immediately 
blocked its circulation 
the trade secretary at the time lord young said he wanted to 
publish the report but that he had been asked by the serious fraud 
office not to divulge details to avoid prejudicing any criminal 
proceedings 
those objections were dropped thursday 
in a statement the public prosecution and serious fraud offices 
said their directors were now satisfied that all lines of inquiry 
have been pursued and that the evidence available is insufficient 
to afford a realistic prospect of conviction for any criminal 
offense relating to any matter of substance raised in the report 
house of fraser issued a statement saying it was heartened that 
the episode was behind it and that it could now concentrate of 
developing the business it is doubtful that any takeover here or 
abroad has been subjected to such exhaustive scrutiny it said 
alfayed thanked his friends colleagues and customers who 
have been so kind and constantly supportive during an unsettling 
past five years

an attorney for drexel burnham lambert group 
inc said thursday that the company is not siphoning money from its 
brokerage subsidiary which is liquidating billions of dollars in 
securities and other assets 
creditors of the collapsed wall street firm raised concerns that 
money available to satisfy what they said were about 500 million 
in claims against the brokerage subsidiary was being reduced 
the brokerage firm drexel burnham lambert inc is not subject 
to the chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of its parent drexel has 
liquidated more than 86 percent of some 47 billion in securities 
holdings as well as other assets since the bankruptcy filing feb 
13 
also the securities and exchange commission said in court 
papers that it is drexels largest creditor and asked to be placed 
on the main committee negotiating in bankruptcy court 
but us bankruptcy judge howard c buschman iii delayed a 
hearing on the motion which claims that drexel owes the sec 150 
million for a fund to compensate investors allegedly defrauded by 
drexel securities law violations 
barry j dichter an attorney for creditor banco de portugal 
said about 500 million in creditors claims exist at the 
subsidiary level he said he was concerned that money being 
generated by drexels liquidation would be transferred to the 
parent and made subject to claims in the bankruptcy case 
that cash thats being generated is creditors cash not 
the parents cash dichter said 
in the days leading up to the bankruptcy filing the parent 
company took about 300 million from the subsidiary to meet 
shortterm debt payments after it was unable to borrow money in the 
credit markets it filed for bankruptcy after defaulting on some 
debt and failing to obtain bank loans 
drexel attorney alan miller said in court that drexels 
subsidiaries were liquidating at arms length from the parent 
and were not sending money raised by asset sales into the parent 
also thursday buschman postponed a hearing on a motion by first 
city bancorp of texas seeking a courtappointed examiner to 
oversee drexels books and one by drexel asking that three board 
members monitor the liquidation the parties agreed to the delay to 
negotiate 
the judge held a closed hearing with attorneys for the sec 
california public employees retirement system and creditors 
committee to try to resolve the motions seeking spots on the panel 
reporters for the associated press the new york times and the 
los angeles times objected to the closeddoor session which the 
judge said constituted a settlement conference and therefore was 
permissible 
drexel has paid the sec 200 million for a 350 million fund to 
compensate investors final installments are due in september and 
in september 1992 
the fund is part of a deal in which drexel last year pleaded 
guilty to six felonies and began paying 650 million in penalties 
to resolve charges stemming from a government insider trading 
investigation both the parent and subsidiary signed the agreement

walter hasselbrings secrets for 
achieving the nations highest corn yield are a lot of bull 
the national corn king credits his topnotch crop to generous 
applications of the real thing from his cattle and his buffalo 
herd illinois largest 
but he teases unsuspecting visitors with another success secret 
telling them he grew 296 bushels per acre last year by serenading 
his corn 
i tell them plants respond to music so at crucial times i 
stroll through my cornfields singing to the plants and you can 
almost see them grow chuckled hasselbring who has grown the 
nations bestyielding corn crop seven times in the last 15 years 
the national corn growers association sponsors the contest and 
2057 farmers entered during the 1989 growing season there were 
seven divisions depending on the type of tillage the area of the 
country and whether irrigation was used 
farmers compete not only to see who can grow the most corn but 
also to come up with new management ideas that could make all 
farmers more efficient said john campen of the st louisbased 
association 
hasselbrings yield was the highest in the 1989 contest said 
campen and established a us record topping his 1975 mark of 
nearly 289 bushels per acre 
his winning yield was more than twice the 138bushelperacre 
average in iroquois county where hasselbring farms 1800 acres in 
eastcentral illinois with his two sons 
you can do everything else right but if you dont get the 
rain you wont win hasselbring said in an interview wednesday 
a high level of fertility also is crucial hasselbring uses 
about 300 pounds of nitrogen per acre roughly twice his normal 
rate he adds manure from his cattle herd and his 105 buffalo 
farmers pay 50 to enter the competition they plant a contest 
plot of at least 25 acres hasselbrings corn went in may 5 and 
the growing season was ideal 
as the crop matured hasselbring walked his contest field 
i could tell things were looking up he said after all 
these years farming you just get an inkling of whats going on 
but when it was harvested it was even more than we expected 
judges approved by the national corn growers association 
supervise the harvest of at least 125 acres from each contest 
plot hasselbrings was combined nov 1314 rules require farmers 
to harvest at random intervals so they cannot pick the best area of 
the field 
university of illinois agronomists fred welch and bob hoeft 
agree with hasselbring that shooting for 300bushel yields on a 
large acreage is a big gamble given high growing costs and the 
inability to control weather 
winning might not mean getting the best dollarreturn for your 
inputs and it is profit not a record yield that is really 
important for commercial farmers welch said 
although the national corn surplus is approaching 2 billion 
bushels the idea that more corn means less profits isnt what 
would keep farmers from adopting highyield techniques campen 
said it is the expense of producing such yields 
the economics at least today on a broad scale basis wouldnt 
warrant it he said 
officials at fred gutwein amp sons inc a familyowned corn and 
soybean seed company based in francesville ind that provided 
hybrids to hasselbring said his success improved gutwein name 
recognition and sales 
our hybrid met the challenge said sales manager eric 
gutwein but it takes a very special individual like duke 
hasselbring to achieve the pinnacle seven times

the tennessee valley authority said 
thursday it will cut about 1400 jobs from its nuclear power plants 
by oct 1 
tva nuclear chief oliver kingsley jr said the reductions which 
will include layoffs will lower tvas nuclear force to 6100 
salaried workers the cuts are the second phase of a job reduction 
plan announced last april 
tva had projected it would have 6800 employees at its six 
nuclear plants on oct 1 
kingsley said the cuts reflected tvas progress in recovering 
from safety and management problems that forced it to shut down its 
nuclear program from august 1985 until may 1988 
he said the cuts would move tva a step closer to making its 
nuclear power staffing levels comparable to industry averages by 
1992 
tva also plans to reduce its nuclear contractors by more than 75 
percent this year from a current level of about 2700 hourly 
workers 
tva had 14380 annual and hourly nuclear employees when it 
restarted sequoyah nuclear plant in early 1988 after a 33month 
outage and continued repairs on two other plants 
more than 4000 jobs were eliminated over the next year and in 
april 1989 tva announced plans to cut its total nuclear staff to 
9363 employees by oct 1 of that year and to 7508 including 
6800 salaried workers by oct 1 1990

he said demand for gasoline was off about 5 percent from a year 
ago possibly reflecting weakness in the economy 
the price slide runs contrary to the normal seasonal pattern of 
rising prices for petroleum products at this time of year as some 
oil refiners shut down to retool for greater gasoline production 
after concentrating on making heating oil for the winter months 
peter beutel head of the energy trading group at elders futures

the markets arent responding as they usually do

not enough demand he said 
coffee futures rose sharply for the second straight day on new 
yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange reaffirming a strong upward

the stock market found a silver lining in a downbeat report on the 
economy 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 834 to 263559 
advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 4 to 3 in

million shares down from 18441 million in the previous session 
nationwide consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including 
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the 
overthecounter market totaled 18531 million shares 
the monthly survey by the national association of purchasing 
management indicated that the manufacturing economy declined in 
february for the 10th consecutive month but at the lowest rate 
since last june 
the financial markets at first believed the report was unlikely 
to prompt the federal reserve to nudge interest rates lower 
the bond market responded negatively with the treasurys 
bellwether 30year bond off about 687 for each 1000 in face 
value by late afternoon wall street initially took its cue from 
the reaction among bond traders but then began to move ahead on 
its own 
analysts said wall street has begun to accept the fact that 
interest rates arent going to come down anytime soon in part 
because us rates must stay high to remain competitive with yields 
in west germany japan and other countries the market also 
realizes that higher rates are necessary to control inflation the 
analysts said 
jack barbanel president of first global asset management inc 
said the market instead of focusing on interest rates was more 
concerned about the possibility of recession traders interpreted 
the purchasing managers report as a signal that the economy 
although slowing wont tip into a recession he said 
but traders lack conviction in the strength of the stock market 
barbanel said noting that as the market reached its high with 
the dow jones average crossing 2655 investors began to take 
profits 
the market shrugged off another sharp loss on the tokyo stock

with walmart stores inc gaining like an 
arkansas rabbit on k mart corps position as the nations 
secondlargest retailer k mart has decided its time for a 
makeover 
k mart has been revamping old stores opening new ones and 
trying to update its blue light special image under a 
fiveyear 23 billion chainwide makeover aimed at fending off 
expanding competitors 
faced with newer stores by such expanding chains as walmart 
from bentonville ark and minneapolisbased dayton hudson corps 
target discount chain k mart has been trying to rouse customers 
with a brighter higherintensity atmosphere expanded product 
offerings and new services 
the stores are moving their usual popcorn and tobacco counters 
away from frontandcenter shedding dull linoleum and cluttered 
aisles and offering such new products as fax machines to attract 
customers 
retail is energy their saliva glands are going their credit 
cards are hot said michael crosson an outside designer hired to 
help shape the chains future 
this isnt goodbye to bluecollar customers who have flocked to 
decades of k mart blue light specials and midnight madness 
sales those will continue k mart spokesman orren f knauer said 
but in a departure from its past k mart has been stocking more 
brandname merchandise to appeal to customers and those household 
names will be better displayed in the new stores chairman joseph 
e antonini said this week 
events of the past week showed the task k mart faces in trying 
to perk itself up 
antonini said on monday that k mart would take a 640 million 
charge against its 1989 earnings to pay for speeding up its 
fiveyear 23 billion chainwide makeover 
as a result k mart is expected to report only minimal or flat 
earnings next week it reported 1988 profits of 8029 million on 
sales of 273 billion 
meanwhile smaller but fastergrowing 1400store walmart 
announced record sales and profits for 1989 with earnings up 285 
percent to 11 billion on sales of 25 billion walmart on 
thursday reported its sales february sales were up 33 percent 
while at its stores open a year or longer sales were up 17 percent 
its not if its when walmart will pass them by at their 
present growth rates said frederick marx an independent 
retailing consultant based in bloomfield hills 
but marx predicted a shifting lead with k mart never far 
behind walmart though growing fast in smalltown america wont 
be able match k marts immense array of store sites in metropolitan 
areas he said 
fighting back will mean changes at almost all of k marts more 
than 2300 discount stores antonini said he announced plans to 
build 250 new stores enlarge 620 relocate 280 close 30 and 
refurbish about 1260 in the fiveyear program 
prototypes already are operating in the detroit suburbs of royal 
oak and rochester mich and virginia beach va 
both new and old stores have adopted folksy walmart style 
peoplegreeters at kmarts oldstyle store in port huron on 
lake huron 60 miles north of detroit a greeter with a rag grinned 
recently as he wiped melted snow from carts just in from the 
parking lot and pushed them toward incoming shoppers 
in the new store instead of a whiff of the popcorn candy and 
tobacco counter of old shoppers are greeted by gleaming floors 
bright lights and wideopen spaces 
the popcorn counter was moved to a cafeteria area right of the 
entrance rest rooms are easy to find stylish graphics mark the 
cosmetics area videos play among the sporting goods and the stores 
have bold signs and bigger stocks of merchandise on the shelves 
look at the jewelry area knauer said its the same 
product we sell in the other stores but the fixturing is more 
departmentstore like it makes the product look better 
crosson executive vice president of jon greenberg and 
associates inc in berkley said such perceptions amounted to 
reality in retailing 
its no longer just a bigger dime store its a discount 
department store he said of k mart 
crossons firm has designed stores for retail establishments 
including abercrombie amp fitch and chains owned by new yorkbased 
mercantile stores which include cincinnatis mcalpins denvers

us and japanese negotiators moved closer thursday 
to an agreement on japanese government purchases of supercomputers 
an area in which the united states contends japan discriminates 
unfairly against foreign sellers officials said 
under us trade law trade officials must report to congress by 
the end of april on the progress of negotiations aimed at removing 
unfair barriers imposed by trading partners japan has been cited 
for alleged restrictions on satellites forestry products and 
supercomputers 
the talks have reached an interesting phase in that we are 
talking about the actual terms of a new arrangement for 
procedures to be used by the japanese government in buying 
supercomputers said a us official who participated in the 
negotiations 
the official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity 
said an august 1987 agreement had failed to result in any purchases 
of us supercomputers by the japanese government 
the purpose is to achieve open competitive procurement 
procedures but we dont think weve achieved that yet we hope by 
a new agreement to arrive at a situation in which the market 
opportunities for us companies truly increase he said 
supercomputers are extremely expensive complex machines used 
for weather forecasting defense systems and other applications 
where a huge number of calculations must be performed quickly 
the talks followed negotiations late last month on forestry 
products and satellites and on economic structures in the two 
nations that have prevented a reduction in japans trade surplus 
with the united states which last year totaled 49 billion all 
three rounds of talks failed to achieve significant results 
officials said adding to trade tension between the two nations 
under the super 301 clause of the us trade law the united 
states can impose penalty tariffs of up to 100 percent on countries 
that fail to remove their trade barriers in negotiations after they 
are cited for unfair practices 
i think there is an intention on both sides to reach an 
agreement on supercomputers said the us official 
foreign ministry officials said us negotiators called on 
japanese agencies to consider the actual performance of 
supercomputers when evaluating competing bids rather than the 
catalog or theoretical performance and to give priority to 
computers that surpass rather than merely meet bidding standards 
in the past the us official said cray research inc the 
only major us manufacturer of supercomputers has lost bids 
because it offered higher performance at a higher price than 
japanese competitors 
us officials in the past also have criticized academic 
discounts offered by japanese computer makers to universities and 
government agencies 
in this weeks talks japanese negotiators said they were aware 
that such practices were unfair and pledged to enforce the 
countrys antimonopoly law the us official said 
japan has refused to negotiate trade disputes under the threat 
of punitive tariffs and noboru hatakeyama director general of the 
ministry of international trade and industrys trade policy bureau 
denied that the talks fell under the us trade law 
we are receiving requests for improvement of our system for 
purchasing supercomputers he said 
we have asked companies to raise prices to a moderate level 
and increased our perunit budget for supercomputers in the fiscal 
1990 draft budget he added we have decided to raise the 
budget so american firms can sell their computers without excessive 
discounts 
japanese negotiators pledged to fully open up government 
procurement of supercomputers but called on the united states to 
do the same the us official said the us government has not 
bought any foreign supercomputers although some japanese machines 
now are competitive with us designs in speed 
my position in response has been that as world leaders they 
should not hesitate to do better than we do in the united states 
he said

government and private business provided more evidence of a 
sluggish but not totally outofsorts economy 
one private report showed a continuing decline in the 
manufacturing economy in february but many of the nations 
retailers reported modest improvement in their fortunes during the 
month 
the government meanwhile reported a mix of pluses and minuses 
construction spending and personal income were up in january but 
so were home prices and mortgage rates

about 250 employees rallied thursday in support 
of nordstrom inc the fashion retailer whose sterling service 
reputation has been sullied by accusations of systematic wage law 
violations and opened a campaign to decertify their union 
accusing the united food amp commercial workers of threatening 
their livelihoods dozens of workers carried signs saying nobody 
asked me i support nordstrom and chanted one two three 
four no more union any more and we love nordstrom 
organizers of the rally also solicited funds to help pay for a 
fullpage advertisement to appear friday in the seattle times 
the truth is that nordstrom treats us fairer than the union 
does joe dover a shoe sales clerk with 11 years of experience 
in bellevue said at the rally 
its time to let the consumers hear both sides of the story 
dover said i say the consumers support nordstrom because 
nordstrom has been good to them for so many years 
the rally added to the controversy over pay practices labor 
relations and declining profits at nordstrom which employs about 
30000 workers at 60 stores in six states 
nordstrom built a nearlegendary reputation for customer service 
from polite and attentive sales clerks however in response to 
complaints brought by the sales clerks union the washington 
department of labor and industries ruled feb 15 nordstrom had 
engaged in a pattern of requiring employees to perform 
uncompensated work 
tasks at issue included having workers attend meetings deliver 
merchandise check inventory write thankyou notes and perform 
other chores without pay outside normal working hours 
the state agency ruled nordstrom must pay two years worth of 
back wages for such tasks and the company set aside a 15 million 
reserve to cover claims from washington state workers 
the union has claimed the provision was inadequate and on monday 
filed a class action suit on behalf of 50000 present and former 
company workers in washington oregon california virginia utah 
and alaska claiming wage and hour violations 
ufcw contracts covering about 1500 clerks in the seattletacoma 
area nordstroms only unionized sales personnel expired aug 1 
last week ruling on a complaint by the union the national 
labor relations board accused nordstrom of bypassing the union and 
bargaining directly with employees over whether they are owed back 
wages union complaints on other issues remain under review said 
larry mccargar assistant to the agencys regional director 
local 1001 president joe peterson said the company has 
conducted an illegal campaign to get rid of the union were going 
to keep on with our campaign to get a fair contract 
but jack mcmillan nordstroms president said thursdays rally 
represented a backlash against the union 
theyve pulled out everything they can think of the press 
coverage has been we think unfair to us in the extreme now the 
employees and the customers are coming to our defense he said 
dozens at the rally cheered as marv treadwell who works in the 
mens suits department in tacoma said petitions calling for an 
election on whether to retain representation by local 367 had been 
signed by 40 percent of the workers eligible to vote at his store 
greg helean a womens shoe sales clerk in bellevue said 
similar petitions were being circulated in the seattle area

the quarter came from payments associated with retiring old debt

news continued to grow with revenue up 28 percent and operating 
profit up 57 percent for the year

tobacco should be outlawed but probably never 
will be a house subcommittee chairman said thursday as lawmakers 
studied ways to keep people from becoming cigarette addicts 
i would love to legislate tobacco out of existence and make it 
criminal rep thomas a luken dohio told lawmakers from north 
carolina a tobaccogrowing state 
luken is chairman of a house subcommittee studying legislation 
aimed at keeping tobacco companies from directing advertising 
campaigns toward women young people and minorities 
under questioning from reps stephen l neal dnc and howard 
coble rnc luken said an outright ban on tobacco wouldnt work 
noting the nations experience with prohibition in the 1920s and 
the current debate over legalizing drugs 
opponents of advertising restrictions argue that supporters 
really would like to see smoking outlawed 
advocates of bans really want to ban smoking not advertising 
for smoking said rep alex mcmillan rnc and a member of the 
transportation and hazardous materials subcommittee that luken 
chairs 
lukens proposed bill would limit print advertising to text only 
there could be no pictures and no logos it would also ban 
advertising directed at minors and ban billboard advertising except 
in sports facilities 
in addition it would ban sports events such as the recent 
virginia slims tennis tournament in washington which critics say 
link smoking with athletics and inserts brand names into sporting 
news copy 
finally the bill would grant states and local governments 
broader authority to regulate advertising within the limits of 
the constitution 
the tobacco industry argues that it is not trying to recruit new 
smokers with targeted campaigns it denies trying to reach youthful 
smokers 
but luken and other advocates of restrictions say that because 
390000 smokers die each year the industry must recruit thousands 
of new smokers each day 
panelist jim slattery dkan said it was clear that tobacco 
companies were targeting youths he argued that the language 
illustrations and basic promotional gimmick of the tobacco campaign 
free tshirts and posters clearly indicate a campaign aimed at 
hooking new smokers 
he showed a brochure that was mailed to a 14yearold from 
connecticut offering free cigarettes after the youth responded to a 
free camel cigarette tshirt offer 
how many tshirts do you write in for slattery asked his 
colleagues 
i contend that when you give away tshirts you are targeting 
children not targeting adults he said 
you dont hang around the same places i do countered rj 
reynolds spokesman dan fishel in a telephone interview from 
winstonsalem nc 
fishel pointed out that it screens out minors who call in 
requests for tshirts and pointed out that the promotional 
material requires a signed affidavit that the person requesting 
material is over 21 
he said he has received only three calls in 15 months from 
parents whose children ordered tshirts he had no marketing data 
on the age breakdown for people responding to the tshirt campaign 
but the mother of the 14yearold said several of her sons 
friends had ordered the tshirts the woman who asked to remain 
anonymous to protect her sons identity said he was 13 when he 
called for the shirt and his voice had not begun changing 
she said she was particularly upset because her father had just 
died as a result of emphysema acquired after years of smoking

initial tests by a washington apple grower have 
identified an organic chemical that may serve as a substitute for 
alar which was banned as a probable carcinogen last year after a 
national scare 
but a scientist for the us department of agriculture said 
thursday it was too early to tell if the growers initial results 
will hold up and that the chemical would require at least two more 
years of study 
eric curry of the usda in wenatchee said such testing generally 
requires three orchards in three locations around the state for 
three years 
sprayngrow a houstonbased company said initial results on 
an orchard owned by a yakimaarea grower found trees treated with 
the chemical produced apples with a significant increase in 
uniformity of color sweetness firmness and harvest time over 
untreated apples 
bill muskopf president of sprayngrow said the chemical 
provides the same benefits as alar while remaining completely 
organic and totally nontoxic 
alar was a synthetic chemical growers used for two decades 
before a private consumer group issued a report last year saying 
consumption of apples treated with the chemical increased cancer 
risk in children the environmental protection agency banned the 
chemical later in the year 
unlike alar sprayngrow is an organic chemical a 
micronutrient that has been proven nontoxic in private tests 
company officials said it has been used by commercial vegetable 
growers and home gardeners for several years the company said 
the alar scare pushed prices for organic apples far above those 
for chemically treated apples organically grown red apples were 
selling for 129 at a seattle market thursday compared to 39 
cents per pound for other red apples 
alars most significant benefit was retaining the internal 
firmness of apples during months of cold storage that will be 
tested with the new chemical this year sprayngrow said

one of the nations largest sizzler restaurant 
franchisees said thursday the sizzler company is trying to ruin his 
business so it can take over his restaurants and control the 
chicago market 
anthony basile president of fbn food services inc and midwest 
restaurant concepts inc is suing sizzler restaurants 
international inc in federal court for 15 million in real damages 
and 10 million in punitive damages alleging fraud and breach of 
covenant of good faith 
mark weisberger general counsel for los angelesbased sizzler 
declined comment on the lawsuit citing a company policy 
basile said his 21 sizzler steakhouse restaurants in the chicago 
area and three in southwestern michigan make him the thirdlargest 
sizzler franchisee in the country 
he contends that sizzlers inconsistent advertising policies 
contributed to a decline in his stores sales and a 35 million 
loss for him and his partners basile said sizzler has offered to 
buy back his restaurants for about half their asset value of 15 
million 
they just did not want to see us succeed because they wanted 
the market back basile said in a telephone interview they 
want to come back into chicago because chicago represents an 
excellent opportunity for future growth 
basile who said he worked as a national foodindustry 
consultant before buying his first eight sizzler restaurants from 
the company in 1987 contended the chicago market could support 50 
to 60 sizzler stores 
franchisers sometimes buy back stores from franchisees so they 
can shrink the contractual territory boundaries of those stores and 
put more stores into the same market said don boroian chairman of 
francorp a franchising consulting firm outside chicago 
basile said the contract he signed in 1987 required him to 
contribute money to a local sizzler advertising cooperative that 
was controlled by another larger sizzler franchisee the 
cooperative bought advertising for all sizzler restaurants in the 
area 
basile said that in 1988 the other franchisee was in financial 
trouble and told him to buy its 12 restaurants or it would withhold 
advertising dollars 
basile said he subsequently learned from the company that the 
other franchisee was not required as basile was to contribute to 
the advertising fund so basile said he agreed to buy out his 
competitor giving basile a monopoly in the chicago market 
he said he then sought help from sizzler in reviving the 
troubled stores only to be refused

the us manufacturing economy slowed in 
february for the 10th consecutive month although the decline was 
at the lowest rate since last june according to a survey of the 
nations purchasing managers released thursday 
the national association of purchasing management said the 
figures showed that although certain manufacturing indicators 
reflected further strength the sustained decline pointed to a 
continued underlying economic weakness 
the trade association said its index rose to 483 percent in 
february from 452 percent in january 
a reading below 50 indicates the us manufacturing economy 
generally is declining above 50 that it generally is expanding 
the february reading was the highest since junes 488 percent 
the group said from its headquarters in tempe ariz 
the report which is closely watched on wall street sent bond 
prices lower in early trading bonds tend to lose value on 
indications that the economy is picking up steam because that 
implies the federal reserve may not be inclined to ease interest 
rates for fear of triggering inflation 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond dropped point or 750 
for every 1000 in face value its yield which rises when prices 
fall climbed to 860 percent from 853 percent late wednesday 
prices were moderately higher on the stock market which 
appeared little affected by the report 
the neworders portion of the groups survey showed that segment 
expanding for the first time since may while the production 
segment registered overall growth for the first time since last 
june in addition both newexport orders and imports continued to 
show increased growth the group said 
the employment portion of the survey declined for the 12th 
consecutive month but the rate of decline was the lowest since 
june 
supplier deliveries were faster for the 10th consecutive month 
and at a significantly greater rate than in january when many 
shortages of delivered goods resulted from severe cold weather the 
group said 
prices of goods declined for the ninth consecutive month and at 
the greatest rate of decline since december 1982 
although the first increases registered in production and new 
orders since mid1989 are encouraging the continued improvement in 
supplier deliveries and significant decline in prices suggests a 
lack of any underlying strength in the economy said robert j 
bretz chairman of the trade groups survey committee and director 
of materials management at pitney bowes inc 
the report is based on a monthly survey of purchasing executives 
at over 300 industrial companies the figures are adjusted for 
seasonal factors

four of pantheon books six senior editors have 
resigned citing the removal of managing director andre 
schiffrin as just the most visible step to date in the publishing 
houses decline 
the resignations were the latest to rock the publishing 
industry which has seen several management shakeups and pressure 
on profits in recent months 
alberto vitale chairman and chief executive of pantheon parent 
random house inc announced schiffrins resignation on tuesday 
schiffrin had joined pantheon in 1962 shortly after its 
acquisition by random house 
its clearly a forced resignation and everybody knows it 
said tom engelhardt one of the four senior editors who resigned 
wednesday the washington post quoted unidentified sources as 
saying schiffrin was forced out after refusing to cut his staff and 
the number of books issued 
vitale said schiffrins resignation was not requested 
schiffrin did not return messages left at his office 
in resigning the four senior editors cited pantheons history 
as a voice for the otherwise unheard and in an accompanying 
statement engelhardt expressed concern that in a publishing world 
increasingly dominated by a few men and a handful of 
relatively faceless media conglomerates independent voices are 
being drowned out by the bottom line 
pantheon was founded in 1942 to protect an imperiled 
culture said the statement from the four editors we sought to 
continue that tradition by bringing into public view the forgotten 
and the iconoclastic the quirky and the profound the crises faced 
by other cultures and by our own 
founded by german exiles helen and kurt wolff pantheon last 
year published more than 100 books its authors have included 
simone debeauvoir george kennan ralph nader herbert gans 
jeanpaul sartre and noam chomsky 
engelhardt and fellow departee wendy wolf maintain that random 
house is considering significantly cutting the list of books 
pantheon will publish wolf says by more than a third 
vitale conceded that pantheon has incurred substantial 
losses over at least the last five years but said there are no 
current plans to cut its list 
it may be necessary i dont know vitale said well have 
to ask fred jordan after awhile 
jordan was named tuesday as pantheon vice president and 
publisher succeeding schiffrin affirming his own commitment to 
preserve pantheons character jordan said management had not 
suggested cutting back on publishing plans 
vitale stressed that a solution to pantheons problems would be 
based first on publishing considerations not financial 
but at least some authors sided with the departees 
studs terkel who wrote seven books for pantheon said he would 
no longer publish with it 
pantheon has always been a classy publisher and andre was a 
symbol of that terkel told the new york times his firing is a 
barbaric act 
in a letter to the times terkel and nine other pantheon authors 
said schiffrins termination like the december departure of robert 
l bernstein as chairman and president of random house resulted 
from their being unable to meet the demands of the proprietors 
to put shortterm return upon investment above the criteria 
of cultural vitality and literary excellence 
random house and pantheon belong to the publishing empire 
controlled by samuel irving newhouse jr and donald edward newhouse 
jordan previously was executive vice president and editor in 
chief of the grove weidenfeld publishing company which was put up 
for sale tuesday following recent resignations of top editors and 
losses estimated at 15 million last year 
schiffrins and the senior editors resignations are effective 
march 15 
the other senior editors are james peck and sara bershtel

the baby boom the massive generation that 
overcrowded schools and colleges and flooded the job market is 
becoming the midlife boom 
the number of americans aged 35 to 44 increased by 95 million 
between 1980 and 1988 the census bureau reported thursday 
this is an average annual increase of 39 percent four times 
the pace of growth of the total population reported frederick w 
hollmann in a study of the population by age sex and race 
the leading edge of that group turned 35 in 1981 and was 40 in 
1986 heading into middle age middle age has no formal census 
definition although some dictionaries list it as the ages 40 to 60 
the aging boomers boosted the 35to44 age group from 259 
million in 1980 to 353 million in 1988 the report said 
as the huge generation born between 1946 and 1964 has aged it 
has affected many segments of society from baby food makers to 
school builders to the makers of blue jeans and business suits 
now the impact may fall back to the baby food market as the 
postworld war ii children begin having their own delayed families 
the population under age 5 is rising again and those in 
elementary school after declining for several years began 
increasing again in 1985 
in their 20s the baby boomers created something of a baby bust 
by postponing marriage and children while pursuing education and 
careers population experts report 
now many are catching up in their 30s a sort of echo of the 
baby boom although birth rates are still nowhere near those 
recorded after world war ii 
the frequency of childbearing among women has increased 
slightly since the early part of the decade primarily in the later 
ages of childbearing reported hollmann 
at the same time the elderly population is growing rapidly 
centenarians in particular 
the larger population aged 100 or more results from several 
factors including something of a baby boom back in the 1880s a 
substantial immigration from europe early in this century and 
improvements in health care during this century 
there were 54000 centenarians in 1988 up from just 14000 in 
1980 
hollmanns report summarizes a wide variety of population trends 
including 
the population aged 14 to 24 declined by 56 million between 
1980 and 1988 as the last of the baby boom turned 25 
the nations black population was 303 million in 1989 up from 
269 million in 1980 blacks increased by 15 percent in 1988 
nearly twice the white growth of 08 percent 
hispanics who can be of any race grew from 148 million in 
1980 to 199 million in 1988 
the fastest growing segment of the population was asians and 
pacific islanders up 70 percent in the 1980s they increased from 
38 million in 1980 to 65 million in 1988 
american indians increased from 14 million to 17 million over 
the decade

serious criminal investigations are 
continuing against northrop corp including allegations of 20 
billion in b2 bomber overcharges despite a pleabargain that 
disposed of scores of criminal charges sources close to the probes 
said thursday 
northrop pleaded guilty tuesday to 34 charges of lying to the 
government and agreed to pay a 17 million fine northrop admitted 
falsifying test data on parts for the cruise missile and harrier 
attack jet 
in exchange the government agreed to drop 139 other counts of 
making false statements and two counts of conspiracy the 
government also dropped several probes into allegations of improper 
testing of mx missile parts and accusations the company 
fraudulently bought mx parts outside normal channels 
but investigations continue into whether northrop bribed south 
korean officials bilked the government while auctioning property 
seized by the customs service and overcharged on b2 parts 
according to congressional investigators and those involved in 
civil suits against the company 
the pleabargain settlement was sealed and northrop officials 
said the company was unable to discuss it with reporters under the 
deal worked out with federal prosecutors 
but in a memo to staff left in the companys lobby northrop 
president kent kresa described how the mx probes had ended but 
some other legal issues remain open 
those include a criminal probe of the b2 program prompted by a 
civil whistleblower lawsuit that seeks damages of 20 billion 
the sources said northrop has acknowledged that fbi agents raided 
its b2 parts plant in pico rivera on feb 15 and seized documents 
related to the program 
you can hardly raid them one week and let them plead out the 
next said an aide to rep john dingell dmich whose house 
subcommittee on investigations has conducted extensive hearings 
into allegations of northrop wrongdoing 
dingell released a statement protesting the sealing of the 
settlement the criminal justice system is supposed to be 
available for review by all our citizens but this represents 
stealth justice he said a reference to the b2 stealth bombers 
supposed ability to hide from radar 
grand juries in los angeles and honolulu continue probes of 
whether northrop made political payoffs to south korea and a texas 
grand jury is looking into the allegations that northrop cheated 
the government in auctioning customs service contraband said the 
dingell aide who spoke on condition of anonymity 
herbert hafif the lawyer for the northrop employees who filed 
the suit alleging b2 overcharges said he had learned the federal 
criminal probe into that case was continuing 
hafif is the lead attorney on several of the whistleblower 
suits in which present or former employees can sue on behalf of 
the government and share in any damages recovered 
northrops guilty plea in the cruise missile criminal case will 
be admissible as evidence in hafifs mirror civil lawsuit in the 
case in that case which goes to trial this year hafif said he 
will seek between 20 million and 30 million in damages from the 
aerospace company 
he also pointed out that while the criminal mx cases have been 
dropped civil lawsuits remain to be tried
