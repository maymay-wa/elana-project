a woman spearfishing off the bahamas lost her right 
hand wednesday in an apparent shark attack when she was surfacing 
with a speared fish in her hand authorities said 
judy st clair 31 a diving instructor from marathon was 
attacked while snorkeling with friends and her parents off highborn 
cay near great exuma island about 220 miles southeast of miami 
said coast guard petty officer steven sapp 
ms st clair was treated on the scene by a miami plastic 
surgeon who was boating nearby and heard the groups distress call 
she then was airlifted by the coast guard to nassau and on to miami 
for more extensive medical treatment 
officials at miamis jackson memorial hospital said they didnt 
know until ms st clair arrived that her hand had actually been 
bitten off in the attack 
the hand is gone said nurse jeanne eckes jacksons trauma 
center coordinator its an amputation above the wrist the 
injury itself actually goes to the wrist and encompasses the 
wrist 
from the looks of her hand it was a big animal that did 
this ms eckes said we can presume it was a shark attack 
ms st clair underwent surgery wednesday night to clean the 
wound and was listed in stable condition she will have to undergo 
future surgery for extensive repair said the nurse adding 
that the severed hand was not recovered 
i think shes in good spirits for what shes been through 
absolutely ms eckes said 
authorities said ms st clair was surfacing by the boat with a 
grouper in her hand when a shark grabbed at the fish and her hand 
pulling her down into the water

the first performance in the united states of 
the queens suite was the news at the thoroughly delightful 
concert of duke ellingtons music in the classical jazz at lincoln 
center series 
ellington was presented to queen elizabeth ii in london in 1959 
and promised her on the spot that he would write a piece of music 
for her he did the ellington band recorded it and one recording 
was pressed which was sent to the queen 
after the composers death in 1974 the master was used to press 
recordings for public sale but until wednesday night in alice 
tully hall the queens suite hadnt been performed in this 
country 
it contains a lovely piano solo the single petal of a rose 
which sir roland hanna played on wednesday his touch isnt the 
same as ellingtons but his stylistic approach is right playing 
solo or with the band 
soloist hero of the evening was jimmy hamilton 72 who was in 
the ellington band from 1943 to 1968 and who came from his home in 
the virgin islands for the concert he played tenor saxophone and 
was a marvel of clarity on clarinet 
wynton marsalis stepped out from the trumpet section to play the 
solo on concerto for cootie which ellington composed for 
cootie williams in 1940 marsalis dynamics were subtle and 
brilliant from a light line ending in a growl to a plunger mute 
line melting into honey 
tenor saxophonist todd williams who is in marsalis band 
played an eightminute solo in diminuendo and crescendo in blue 
and got heads bobbing and hands clapping in the audience its 
risky to confront a great liveperformance event as paul 
gonsalves suddenly inspired 27 choruses in this piece at the 
newport jazz festival in 1956 but williams created the same kind 
of excitement 
the evening began with ellingtons and billy strayhorns 
arrangement of the nutcracker which uses the nutcracker 
suite as inspiration for witty new compositions one hears some 
of the dance of the flowers in dance of the floreadores but 
thats about all that remains of tchaikovsky 
david berger who conducted the 15piece band knowledgeably has 
transcribed more than 100 ellington compositions 
the band sounded a lot like the ellington band its voicings 
smooth and plush as velvet the band and the music sounded 
excitingly brightly brandnew after encores of jack the bear 
and take the a train the audience yelled for more 
other musicians were willie cook norris turney joe temperley 
britt woodman and jimmy woode former members of the ellington 
band and lew soloff marcus belgrave frank wess art baron jimmy 
knepper and kenny washington the concert will be repeated thursday

a pacific coast train plunged off a 
bridge into a rainswollen river in northwestern mexico on 
wednesday killing at least 85 people and injuring 107 an official 
involved in the search said 
one report said more than 100 people killed when the engine and 
two passenger cars fell from the rio bamoa bridge about 50 miles 
southeast of los mochis and about 730 miles northwest of mexico 
city 
the bridge collapsed but it was not clear whether heavy rains 
washed parts of it out before the northbound train got there 
red cross and other officials said rescue work was continuing 
through the night 
most of the victims drowned said javier lopez the red cross 
duty officer in los mochis they fell into the water and died of 
asphyxiation he said 
the second class train which is popular with younger us 
tourists was en route from the coastal resort of mazatlan to 
mexicali on the california border said national railroad official 
ignacio duran 
rail and rescue officials could provide no early breakdown on 
any foreign casualties 
searchers recovered the bodies after a daylong rescue attempt 
said manuel meraz moreno chief of radio communications at the 
sinaloa state public security office 
this is confirmed there are 85 people dead and 107 injured 
said meraz moreno in a telephone interview 
the government news agency notimex quoted unidentified police 
sources in los mochis as saying there were more than 100 dead but 
the report could not be immediately confirmed 
meraz said the bodies and the injured were being brought to the 
nearby towns of gusave and guamuchil 
relatives late wednesday identified the first eight bodies lying 
in three funeral parlors in the small town of guamuchil a few 
miles where the accident occurred they were all mexicans 
rescue workers said aid efforts had been hampered by heavy rains 
in the area they said a huge rainstorm tuesday night damaged long 
stretches of railbed and blocked roads and highways 
it stopped raining in the late afternoon and this helped a 
lot said abel roldan a rescue worker at the village of bamoa 
11 miles from the crash news photographers who flew over the scene 
said they could see passenger cars lying jumbled some of them on 
their side in the river at the bottom of a deep ravine 
they are still going through the wreckage there may be more 
victims we dont know yet meraz said he said rescue crews were 
working into the night 
the engine and two of four passenger cars plunged into the river 
and two other passenger cars and two mail and cargo cars derailed 
said duran 
lopez of the red cross said the bridge had been destroyed and 
service was suspended on the line but it was not known if the 
bridge was washed out before the train got there 
roberto martinez maestre a spokesman for the sinaloa state 
government who is based in mexico city said part of the train 
plunged down the embankment 
the cause was quite clear the heavy rains loosened the 
railbed and and the rails just gave way the train went against 
the bridge and down into the river said martinez who was in 
contact with state officials 
maria eugenia batista a red cross nurse in guamachi said many 
passengers suffered minor injuries some were evacuated in 
railway service cars a few at a time she said 
janet gaxiole sandoval a secretary at a social security clinic 
in guasave said at least 20 of the injured were in serious 
condition 
los mochis lies 410 miles south of nogales ariz train 
derailments and other accidents have been frequent throught mexico 
especially in the pacific areawhere railbeds and equipment are old 
and rains are frequent and heavy 
but wednesdays was by far the most work mexican train accident 
in the past five years 
on may 4 a passenger train derailed about 400 miles northwest 
of mexico city killing at least eight people and injuring 50 two 
days earlier 20 people suffered minor injuries when a passenger

setting a price on a historical letter 
can be a relative thing particularly when the writer was albert 
einstein 
howard whetsel of oak ridge said wednesday he is satisfied with 
the 4000 he was paid by a california broker for a 1947 letter he 
received from einstein the scientist who formulated the theory of 
relativity 
i probably could have gotten more but the letter was getting 
fragile said whetsel 78 a retired chemist and editor at oak 
ridge national laboratory 
whetsel said he decided to sell the onepage note because it was 
yellowing and he couldnt take care of it properly its got a 
few years left in it he said 
profiles in history a broker in old documents and famous 
signatures in beverly hills calif bought the letter whetsel got 
his check last week and the letter has already been resold 
joe maddalena owner of the brokerage refused in a telephone 
interview wednesday to say how much he resold the letter for or to 
whom but he said whetsel did very well i can tell you that he 
should be very happy 
whetsel speculated the 4000 he received might have covered the 
value of einsteins signature alone without accounting for the 
contents of the letter 
maddalena said the price of the letter included what was 
actually written in the missive which he described as a good 
content letter 
einsteins letters are very common he said he wrote 
thousands and thousands and thousands of them 
for that reason he said a signature of einstein on a 
historically insignificant letter would be worth about 1000 
compared to the most valuable einstein letter a 1939 message to 
president franklin d roosevelt encouraging development of the 
atomic bomb the fdr letter sold for 220000 maddalena said 
einsteins letter to whetsel was in response to a letter from 
whetsel who wanted to sort out some conflicting accounts of the 
physicists beliefs on scientific concepts and theories 
the question concerned a physics concept that held that a rod 
traveling at the speed of light would contract in the direction it 
was moving some biographies said einstein depended on this concept 
in formulating his special theory of relativity other biographies 
said he didnt 
whetsel who met einstein at princeton university while working 
on the manhattan project decided to write einstein directly 
einstein in his letter to whetsel essentially said the 
question was moot because it was found that this contraction is 
the consequence of his own special theory of relativity so that 
no arbitrary hypothesis had to be made with respect to moving solid 
bodies 
that settled it whetsel said adding that while he didnt 
necessarily agree whos going to argue with einstein 
maddalena said he has purchased 20 einstein letters in the last 
three months alone its like anything else he said as 
people find out these things have value they are selling them

now that hundreds of us navy 
sailors have roamed its streets this restricted black sea port 
seems to have little left to hide 
but some residents want sevastopol kept offlimits anyway not 
to preserve military secrets but to keep its supplies of sausage 
and other foodstuffs out of the hands of other soviets 
to talk about military secrets after this visit is absurd 
said sergei koshkin deputy editor in chief of the local newspaper 
the glory of sevastopol but to tell the truth the population 
doesnt want the city opened for purely practical reasons 
sevastopol is one of a number of soviet cities that remain 
offlimits for most soviet citizens as well as foreigners 
sometimes the kremlins rationale for closing them is unclear but 
in this case its obvious sevastopol is the home port for the 
soviet navys black sea fleet 
on friday the americans sailed into sevastopol to a heros 
welcome but ordinary soviets must pass through checkpoints if they 
enter by car or have their documents scanned by patrols if they 
come by bus or train 
officially only close relatives of residents are allowed in to 
visit and then only for limited periods 
residents say the restrictions limit the flow of tourists that 
might flood the southern crimean city of nearly 400000 people 
and like vacationers in yalta and other coastal cities sweep up 
what remains on store shelves 
meat butter and sugar already are rationed in sevastopol but 
by soviet standards things could be much worse koshkin said he 
was recently in vladivostok a strategic port in the soviet far 
east that was recently opened up and in terms of produce 
theres nothing there nothing 
as president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms change the way 
soviet farmers and industries do business the country is suffering 
from worsening shortages of food and such basic items as 
toothpaste soap detergent and medicine official statistics say 
meat is now rationed in 24 regions of the russian republic alone 
soap in 30 regions and sugar virtually everywhere 
stores in sevastopol are relatively wellstocked with shorter 
lines than in moscow where an estimated 1 million outoftowners 
come daily to shop swelling store queues and bringing grumbles 
from natives 
other closed soviet cities are also reluctant to take down their 
walls despite the kremlins policy of greater openness according 
to a report wednesday in the newspaper socialist industry 
in an unidentified spaceindustry city in siberia retirees 
offered to pay themselves for patrols to guard the city rather than 
allow it to be opened it said 
its not hard to understand people the newspaper said 
its the psychological comfort that has accumulated over the 
years the stability the extra defense thats guaranteed by that 
high fence 
in sevastopol residents say that despite existing restrictions 
the summer sunshine brings a surge of tourists who come to enjoy 
the hilly citys fresh air classical architecture roses and 
seaside promenades they also explore the citys history its 
record of invaders ranging from the ancient scythians to the 
germans and its prolonged sieges during the crimean war in the 
mid1850s and world war ii 
in the winter you can buy milk freely but in the summer 
its all snatched up in the morning said former navy lt valery 
karyakin who had been based in sevastopol during his tour of duty 
and was preparing to leave 
still karyakin said he would have preferred the city be opened 
so he could freely invite friends to visit 
one sevastopol woman said her parents who lived two hours away 
in simferopol were allowed to visit for only one month in summer 
if they want to visit for even one day in december they cant 
she said 
the restrictions already somewhat archaic in the face of 
modernday satellite photography seemed even more pointless after 
western correspondents were given a free rein to wander about and 
take pictures during the fiveday visit of the us warships the 
cruiser uss thomas s gates and the frigate uss kauffman left 
sevastopol on tuesday 
a picturesque promenade built along the edge of downtown 
sevastopol looks down on inlets where dozens of soviet submarines 
warships and research vessels are at rest or under repair 
as two western photographers focused their longrange lenses on 
the display of naval hardware soviet passersby stared 
suspiciously and clucked in disapproval but did not move to stop 
them 
a policeman who checked the journalists documents let them go 
with the mild reprimand that it is not desirable to photograph 
here

a convicted murderer upset at prison 
conditions held another inmate and a prison worker at gunpoint for 
9 hours wednesday but released them unharmed and killed himself 
officials said 
thomas walden 42 fatally shot himself in the neck at 1026 
pm about 30 minutes after talking by telephone with his brother 
state department of corrections commissioner parker evatt said 
walden was armed with a 25caliber automatic when he 
overpowered a guard shortly before his schedule transfer from 
mccormick correctional institution to another state prison 
corrections spokesman francis x archibald said 
prison officials could not account for how walden acquired the 
pistol but said they would investigate how it got into the prison 
walden took the two hostages around 1130 am in the prisons 
furnituremanufacturing building archibald said he had asked for 
his attorney his prison file and to make a phone call to his wife 
the spokesman said 
walden released the inmate hostage at 425 pm and freed the 
prison worker shortly before 9 pm after negotiators agreed to let 
him telephone members of his family archibald said 
after talking with his brother evatt said walden continued to 
speak by telephone with corrections officials but then walked to 
the other end of the and shot himself 
although walden was upset at his impending transfer to perry 
correctional institution near pelzer evatt said he never asked to 
remain in mccormick and appeared to accept the move later in the 
evening 
department officials said walden and another inmate were 
reportedly at odds and that in the routine procedure to separate 
such prisoners walden happened to be the inmate that had to be 
moved 
archibald said walden was particularly incensed that he was to 
be transferred to what would have been his fourth prison since 
november 1984 when he began serving a sentence of life and 24 
years for murder and armed robbery 
prison officials locked the other prisoners in their cells while 
officials negotiated with walden 
mccormick near the georgia state line about 70 miles west of 
columbia is a medium to maximumsecurity prison that was built as 
an 808bed prison but has been allowed by the courts to 
doublecell some inmates and is at its maximum capacity of 1100

they shot butchy doe again and nobody is 
surprised 
hes a convicted bank robber who just got out of jail on a 
firearms charge and is a suspect in at least three slayings police 
say they think this is the fourth attempt to kill him and there 
may be more they dont know about 
in may arthur l butchy doe jr 30 took three bullets 
when armed men stormed his girlfriends apartment in charlestown 
she died 
somebody called the hospital where doe was recovering dont 
bother stitching him up because when he gets out were gonna shoot 
him again the man said 
on tuesday doe was ambushed leaving a deli and carrying a 
sandwich and a can of soda he took a bullet in the chest but is 
expected to live for a while 
on wednesday the boston detective who oversees charlestown said 
police already have everything they need on who is trying to kill 
butchy doe except a witness who will testify 
we know who did it we know who dunnit last time said lt 
detective edward j mcnelley you gonna come forward and say its 
him the problem is what we know and what we can prove the whole 
town knows who did it 
the people behind the counter at colliers meat deli where at 
least three shots were fired said they had never heard of butchy 
doe 
but a group of 13 and 14yearold boys hanging around the stoop 
next door were happy to point out the spot where doe dropped his 
sandwich on the sidewalk and clutched the center of his chest the 
boys and four other neighbors all speaking on condition of 
anonymity said they knew who did it 
asked why nobody would help the police one 14yearold boy 
replied if they dont want to look like butchy doe they dont 
tell 
busing battles soaring real estate prices and even 
gentrification have done nothing to weaken the old code of loyalty 
in charlestown a tough irish neighborhood surrounding bunker hill 
that mcnelley described as probably the bank robbery capital of 
the world 
for years the tight hilly streets have sheltered 50 to 70 
professional bank robbers many of whom were never caught mcnelley 
said 
in the early 1960s two groups of stickup men got into a fight 
over a woman the story has it that one man spit in the face of 
anothers girlfriend mcnelley said the resulting gang war lasted 
several years and killed at least 56 people 
with these guys getting shot is just a way of life 
mcnelley said 
mcnelley said he didnt know the trigger for the latest round of 
shooting and retaliation but cocaine heroin and angel dust are 
believed to be a factor 
neighbors speaking on condition of anonymity offered a number 
of other explanations 
one theory has it that both attacks on doe are the fallout from 
the armed robbery of 254000 from a bank inside massachusetts 
general hospital in early may the person who wouldnt allow 
himself to be identified and who claimed to be a relative of doe 
said the hard feelings began when doe drove away in the getaway car 
and later refused to share the money the robbery has not been 
solved and doe was never charged 
another story has it that 10 years ago doe was blamed for a 
murder rather than going to the police they took the law into 
their own hands they beat him up real bad yeah hes always had 
kind of a resentment about that 
a taxi driver described doe as homely man with dirty blond hair 
and deepset eyes who favors hightop sneakers football shirts and 
always wears a cap hes been seen often near a housing project 
carrying a bag that some believe contains a gun 
hes a very vicious person the driver said hes been in 
so much trouble over the years the cops dont really care if he 
gets killed in fact the cops probably would like to see him 
killed 
a boy who identified himself as does nephew 13yearold richie 
doe said his uncle told family members he expected to be out of 
the hospital within two weeks 
neighbors unanimously predicted the vendetta will be settled 
soon after in the old charlestown way 
theyre going to get him till he dies if he dont get them 
first said one

the state of colorado asserting its regulatory 
authority over a federal hazardous waste reprocessing program has 
cited the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant for allegedly storing 
plutoniumcontaining residues without a permit 
gov roy romer told reporters on wednesday the state health 
department has ordered rocky flats to provide a schedule for 
developing an accurate description of the nature source and 
location of the hazardous residue stored in barrels 
the conflict with the plant operated by rockwell international 
for the department of energy stems from stored material that may 
be reprocessed over which the state has no authority and 
material exceeding the 1601 cubic yard limit that must be shipped 
out of the state for permanent storage elsewhere 
the department also required a plan for bringing the residue 
storage into compliance with hazardous waste requirements 
the schedule and plan are required within 30 days of receipt of 
the violation notice or plant officials may be subjected to a fine 
to be determined later 
the materials have been stored at the plant for some time for 
the recovery of plutonium a component used in the manufacturing of 
nuclear weapon triggers the plants main production item 
rocky flats officials who had no immediate comment about the 
states action claimed the residues are exempted from regulation 
because they will be recycled the state argues that some of the 
residues are not subject to that exemption 
eventually based on more information the state is demanding doe 
to submit the state will determine the most appropriate way to 
manage the wastes 
dowsett said some of the barrels of residues which do not 
contain enough plutonium to justify the expense of recovering it 
should be handled as waste under the law that applies to hazardous 
waste 
but some of the barrels with economically recoverable levels of 
plutonium need to be managed as hazardous wastes

babies conceived in laboratories with the 
hightech help of fertility experts are just as likely to be normal 
as babies made by amateurs in the traditional way researchers say 
the study was conducted to determine if infants conceived by in 
vitro fertilization the socalled testtube babies are more apt 
to develop physical or mental abnormalities than other children 
said dr james l mills a national institute of child health and 
human development researcher 
the original question was are these children going to be 
developmentally delayed the answer to that is very clearly not 
mills said wednesday in a telephone interview they did extremely 
well 
in a study published this month in the journal of pediatrics 
mills and a team of scientists from eastern virginia medical school 
compared the development of 83 children born as a result of in 
vitro fertilization or ivf with 93 children born from normal 
conception the children were matched by age sex race age of the 
mother and other factors they were all between 12 months and 30 
months old 
all of the ivf children were conceived at the eastern virginia 
medical school in norfolk va and the infants in the other group 
were randomly selected from among children born within 100 miles of 
norfolk 
mills said the children in both groups were subjected to an 
extremely complete job of looking for malformations or birth 
defects the tests included a variety of imaging techniques such 
as ultrasound that could detect physical abnormalities of internal 
organs 
the children also were assessed individually using tests that 
measure mental development of the very young 
no statistically important difference was found between the 
groups 
two of the ivf children had major malformations compared to one 
such case among the nonivf infants mills said but the difference 
is not considered significant 
he said that since the number of children examined for the study 
was small there remains some statistical question about the minor 
differences in the frequency of malformations but mills added that 
when you take our paper along with other data such as ivf 
records from australia its very reassuring 
in tests of mental development the ivf children did slightly 
better than the other group 
we feel very comfortable about the intellectual development 
because they did very very well said mills he said that 
even though there was a careful effort to match the two groups of 
children on a basis of parental income and educational level the 
ivf children still did better 
this finding may reflect the fact that the parents of the ivf 
children went to a tremendous amount of trouble to have these 
children and they were going to make sure that these children got 
the best in terms of stimulation and care 
though children conceived by the ivf procedure popularly are 
called test tube babies conception actually takes place in a 
laboratory petri dish not a test tube 
the dish is filled with chemicals designed to mimic the 
environment of the maternal reproductive system sperm from the 
father and eggs recovered surgically from the mother are united in 
the dish and allowed to form embryos selected embryos then are 
implanted into the mothers uterus and development can then proceed 
to a normal birth 
no one knows exactly what the effect might be of starting 
the embryonic period in media chemicals instead of in the uterus 
theres no way they can make that exactly like the normal 
situation said mills there was that basis for wondering if 
these kids would turn out all right 
ivf techniques were first successful in england but the 
procedure is now common in the united states australia and other 
countries mills said thousands of children worldwide have been 
born through the ivf procedure 
the eastern virginia medical school team that conducted the 
study with mills was led by dr norma c morin

people in felix blochs position often put a 
coat over their heads or run the other way whenever a news camera 
is pointed at them but bloch the most visible spy suspect ever 
uses a different approach 
he makes himself available to every lens and microphone 
ive developed a real symbiotic relationship with the media 
said bloch who has not by choice been leading a caravan of fbi 
and news people since it was revealed he is suspected of spying for 
the soviet union 
blochs walks around washington are attracting attention the way 
harry trumans used to bloch made a trip to the cleaners wednesday 
and it was recorded by cameras he went for a 22mile hike tuesday 
and caused a coterie of bloch watchers to go huffing and puffing 
along 
wednesday was an easier day bloch sat on a park bench for two 
hours enjoying the cool bright day as much as anyone can with 
microphones brushing his lips 
he reached down to pet his poodle mephisto and a dozen cameras 
whirred he stretched back hands behind his head and microphones 
stretched out too people stared but bloch paid them no mind 
its lovely bloch said i assure you that were it 95 
degrees and 70 percent relative humidity i would not be out here 
but i wont say anything about the allegations 
will there come a time when he will 
possibly 
its that possibility and the summer doldrums that causes tv 
networks and other news organization to continue the expensive 
stakeouts 
the circus atmosphere around bloch attracted a persistent 
heckler and he finally said im not saying another word as long 
as you are here the fbi agents who were keeping an eye on this 
years bestknown spy suspect finally felt compelled to tell the 
man to back off 
the government has brought no charges and bloch is free to do 
what and when he pleases 
im amazed that people have nothing better to do he said to 
a reporter who was doing what his editors expected him to do 
bloch a highranking diplomat at the us embassy in vienna for 
much of the decade is on leave from the diplomatic service while 
the government investigates his conduct 
his new bond with news people was cemented tuesday when he hiked 
into the maryland countryside trailed by his entourage 
i normally dont take walks like that but i had the time and 
the weather was propitious bloch said i had the inclination 
it was time to prove to myself perhaps that i could outlast the 
media and the fbi 
but they cheated they rode part of the way they rented 
bikes they brung in other teams they may even have been in a 
helicopter overhead 
ultimately he said i was disappointed because i had to break 
down and accept a ride from cbs news i had a funny question on the 
way home they were in communication with their offices by radio 
and said can we take you in to the bureau i said what the 
fbi 
he didnt go to cbs the news crew he said were men and 
women of their word they dropped me off at my home 
what did his walk accomplish 
i never asked myself that question whether it accomplishes 
anything or not said bloch if i have time on my hands i like 
to mix it up i read i cook i clean the house i write i work on 
this or that and i want to get my fresh air 
does he have any idea when there will be any kind of resolution 
of his case 
you are going to have to speak with people other than myself 
was he being kept twisting in the wind to use john ehrlichmans 
famous phrase 
well i think im sitting pretty firmly on the bench he 
said now unless the fourth estate will buy me lunch im going 
home 
the offer was made but bloch declined and took mephisto home

two dozen plants accounted for a third of all 
the highly hazardous industrial chemical releases reported in the 
united states in 1987 a national conservation group says in an 
analysis of government figures 
the national wildlife federation analysis released today showed 
that 500 plants in 44 states disposed about 75 billion pounds of 
toxic waste through burial or release into the air water or public 
sewage system 
the two dozen plants in 13 states released 35 billion pounds of 
toxic waste in 1987 the report said the material included 
chemicals and metals some 39 of which are considered carcinogenic 
the emissions are legal but legislation pending before congress 
would curb many of the releases by setting tighter standards for 
toxic industrial waste 
seven of the 12 biggest producers of toxic wastes use burial for 
disposal while five inject wastes deep into the ground industry 
defends that method of disposal but environmentalists disagree 
increasingly such disposal methods threaten the nations 
ground water which supplies drinking water for almost 50 percent of 
americans the federation said 
which community will see disease outbreaks from polluted 
surface and ground water what species of fish or wildlife will be 
threatened by acute or chronic toxicity no one knows said 
federation president jay hair 
in a preface to the report hair said its purpose was to 
emphasize the scope of toxic release problems 
he cautioned that the figures themselves provide no accurate way 
to predict health or environmental effects but he said they make 
clear we are dumping too many chemicals into our environment at 
too high a level 
no 1 on the top 500 list was the alcoa plant in point comfort 
texas which reported 465 million pounds of toxic wastes in 1987 
almost all of it buried at the facility 
a dozen facilities each reported more than 100 million pounds of 
wastes were released while 118 plants reported disposing at least 
10 million pounds the study said each facility reported at least 
26 million pounds of toxic releases 
the environmental protection agency made the raw data available 
last month after receiving reports from more than 18000 facilities 
the 480page federation analysis said the 75 billion pounds of 
toxic material released by the 500 facilities was about 70 percent 
of the total 103 billion pounds reported in 1987 the latest year 
for which figures were available 
alcoa had three other plants among the top 15 on the list of 
those releasing the largest amounts of toxic material including 
its rockdale texas plant which was no 3 with 329 million pounds 
of wastes most buried on plant grounds 
the national steel corp great lakes division plant at ecorse 
mich was the second biggest disposer of toxic wastes at 423 
million pounds almost all buried a few miles away 
the buried wastes at the two texas alcoa plants as well as the 
national steel corp plant in michigan consisted largely of 
aluminum oxide a chemical that can damage the respiratory system 
and may contribute to brain damage 
according to the study five companies each reported more than 
30 million pounds of toxic emissions released into the air in 1987 
part of the roughly 26 billion pounds of such wastes sent airborne 
by all companies reporting to the epa 
amax magnesium owned by amax inc in rowley utah released the 
most material into the air 68 million pounds of toxics mostly 
chlorine 
kennecott utah copper the mining company owned by british 
petroleum accounts for the largest amount of toxic metal waste 
most of it copper but also arsenic chrome barium and zinc 
compounds most of the 158 million pounds of wastes are buried on 
kennecott property 
the three companies that released the largest amount of toxic 
chemicals into water are in louisiana 
two agrico chemical co plants in uncle sam and 
donaldsonville la were ranked no 1 and no 3 disposing 59 
million pounds and 44 million pounds of chemicals respectively 
mostly phosphoric acid 
the arcadian corp of geismar la ranked second with 54 
million pounds of mostly phosphoric and sulfuric acid

foreign ownership of american farmland is 
remaining steady with overseas investors accounting for about 1 
percent of agricultural acreage in the united states last year the 
general accounting office says 
a total of 13215 parcels comprising almost 125 million acres 
with an overall value of 95 billion were held by 7790 foreign 
individuals and corporations said the report prepared by the 
congressional research arm 
that overall picture has not changed much for a decade although 
there have been significant fluctuations in holdings by specific 
countries the gao said in a report to sen quentin burdick dnd 
british owners had the largest share of foreign holdings last 
year with 278 million acres or 223 percent the report said it 
said canadians were next with 25 million acres or 20 percent 
then came the french with 114 million acres or 9 percent and 
west germans with 113 million acres or 9 percent 
the report measures farmland ownership by foreign persons 
which it defines as foreign individuals or corporations holding 
interests of 10 percent or more the threshold is 50 percent or 
more if several foreigners own shares of less than 10 percent and 
are not acting in concert 
britain canada france and west germany were the only countries 
whose nationals held 1 million acres or more of us agricultural 
land and together they accounted for about 60 percent of foreign 
ownership 
the gao did point out that one obstacle to uncovering the 
ultimate beneficiaries of foreign ownership is that the department 
of agriculture places limits on how deeply it inquires into the 
maze of subsidiaries and holding companies that have an interest in 
us farmland 
thus a holding company based in an offshore tax haven is often 
able to screen from view the actual beneficiaries 
acreage held in the netherlands antilles switzerland panama 
and liechtenstein would if combined form the third largest share 
of foreign investment in us farmland with 178 million acres or 
142 percent it said

americas major farm export subsidy program 
boosted us wheat shipments overseas 10 percent to 30 percent in 
198687 but did not perform as well the next year according to 
recent studies 
after studying the numbers economists conclude that the 
agriculture departments export enhancement program is more 
effective in years when world stocks are high us supplies are 
large and competition is keen according to the august issue of 
usdas agricultural outlook magazine 
tight supplies and high demand from importers diminish the 
importance of the program it said 
under the program exporters are paid bonuses for selling us 
farm commodities overseas the bonuses take the form of socalled 
generic certificates which can be sold for cash or redeemed for 
commodities held by usdas commodity credit corp 
the export enhancement program has increased the us share of 
certain north african markets the american share of the moroccan 
wheat market shot up from 50 percent to almost 100 percent through 
the end of last year 
the us share of the algerian market rose from 25 percent in 
198485 to more than 70 percent in 198687 the gains came at the 
expense of the european community a fierce competitor whose own 
subsidies were used as a rationale for starting the export 
enhancement program 
from 1985 when the program got its start through this july 
bonuses totaling 26 billion have been distributed to push 84 
billion in commodities into the global marketplace

industrial consumers of sugar and other 
sweeteners are urging agricultural officials to raise the import 
quota on foreign sugar citing a 2cent increase in domestic raw 
sugar prices in recent months 
immediate relief is urgently needed to increase the supply of 
imported sugar said a statement from thomas hammer president of 
the sweetener users association representing companies that use 
sweeteners in their products such as candy and softdrink makers 
the government maintains tight quotas on the import of sugar as 
a means of protecting us sugar growers and the cornsweetener 
industry from lowerpriced foreign sugar 
sugar growers sensitive to complaints that they are getting a 
specialinterest boon at the expense of consumers unveiled a study 
on tuesday saying that combined with the sweetener makers they 
create 144442 jobs and pump 74 billion a year into the nations 
economy 
with us sugar prices far above the world market level 
however the complaints are guaranteed to keep coming as congress 
gears up to write a farm bill next year 
the recent increase in raw sugar prices reflects the extremely 
tight supplies of raw sugar which are threatening normal 
operations within the sugar industry hammer said 
the recent volatile price situation demonstrates the absurdity 
of the statements that have been made suggesting that the nations 
restrictive sugar program is a good deal for the american consumer 
because it ensures stable prices

tuition inflation is easing a bit at many 
colleges especially public twoyear institutions but a year at 
the costliest private colleges will top 21000 an annual survey 
shows 
the college board in its annual tuition survey released 
wednesday found average charges heading 5 to 9 percent higher come 
fall 
at twoyear public colleges the increase will average 5 percent 
to 842 slightly less than the 59 percent annualized rise in 
consumer prices during the first six months of 1989 
average tuition and fees at fouryear public institutions will 
increase 7 percent to 1694 with an additional 3039 in average 
room and board charges 
some 80 percent of us college students attend public 
institutions costs at those and other institutions of higher 
learning had been surging consistently faster than the overall 
inflation rate throughout the 1980s 
it looks like the increases are moderating somewhat said 
richard rosser president of the national association of 
independent colleges and universities the gap between the 
increases and the consumer price index is narrowing 
on the other hand were still feeling awful pressures on 
faculty salaries they are still below 1972 levels in terms of 
purchasing power 
private fouryear college rates meanwhile continue to soar 
average tuition and fees this fall will rise by 9 percent to 
8737 room and board charges will add an average of 3898 
among the costliest a year at bennington college in vermont 
will cost an estimated 21775 including tuition fees room and 
board books supplies transportation and other expenses harvard 
college in boston brandeis university in waltham mass and sarah 
lawrence college in bronxville ny are among other highly 
selective schools that will top the 21000 mark 
students may not realize that more expensive colleges usually 
have more financial aid available and use more of their own funds 
for aid said board president donald m stewart 
he added that financial aid from public and private sources now 
totals a record 26 billion 
nonetheless us secretary of education lauro f cavazos said 
he was increasingly concerned about the growing gap between the 
price of higher education and what students can afford 
every leader in higher education must make holding costs down 
a priority he said 
in addition freshmen at some top schools face a double dose of 
bad tuition news 
duke university the university of chicago johns hopkins 
university seton hall university and george washington university 
are among a few that have recently announced twotiered tuition 
systems in which firsttime students will be hit with doubledigit 
increases roughly twice those imposed on upperclassmen 
the priciest fouryear public colleges charge fees comparable to 
private institutions at least for outofstate students at the 
university of vermont for example nonresident undergraduates 
face total estimated costs of 17084 8000 more than vermont 
residents 
at private twoyear colleges tuition fees will rise an average 
7 percent to 4713 while average room and board charges will add 
3258 
the college boards 1989 averages were based on cost data from 
1892 of the nations 3200 colleges and universities 
the college board is a private nonprofit organization whose 
members include over 2600 colleges and other educational 
institutions

children are racking up huge telephone charges 
without parental permission on the promise of talking to mighty 
mouse woody woodpecker and other cartoon characters a childrens 
advocacy group says 
atampt should be required to provide consumer safeguards for use 
of the specialcharge 900 numbers action for childrens television 
said wednesday in a petition filed with the federal trade 
commission 
the advocacy group contends that sponsors of the phone services 
have found a way to target children 12 and under with 
advertisements urging them to dial a 900 number 
andrea west product marketing manager for 900 numbers at atampt 
said the company was being unfairly singled out because other 
companies also offer the service usually after atampt has rejected 
them because of its guidelines 
we are the only ones that have a standard she said 
at a cost of 2 for the first minute and 45 cents for each 
additional minute children are told they can speak to the 
character the petition said the children listen to a recorded 
message that often asks the caller to call again for a new story or 
a continuation of the present one 
robert h lorsch whose beverly hillsbased teleline inc is a 
major producer of the programs says his company has cooperated in 
all efforts to set standards for the industry 
he said his research has shown that most children get their 
parents permission to make the calls 
the act petition asked that atampt be forced to give refunds to 
parents who are caught by surprise with such bills at least for 
the first such bill that blocking devices be made available to 
screen out 900 numbers and that bills be clearly itemized to 
denote those services which are directed to children under 12 
years of age 
the 900 numbers invite children to talk to popular personalities 
and cartoon characters such as the tooth fairy mighty mouse or 
woody woodpecker and often offer products such as posters signs or 
shirts as enticements to call according to the act petition 
while atampt relies on the fact that the price of such calls is 
displayed in the advertisement and that there are clear admonitions 
not to call without parents permission these advertisements are 
no less deceptive and unfair the petition said 
the 10yearold child does not really take in the information 
about the charge the petition said even if the child does 
understand that a charge will be made he or she cannot make a 
reasonable decision about the appropriate size of the monthly bill 
as against family income or other claims upon it 
the ads run mostly on independent stations between 2 and 5 pm 
with most of the viewers being latchkey children whose parents 
are away act said 
atampts west said she agrees in principle with itemizing the 
bills but that is up to local companies some local companies 
already block 900 services automatically she said 
as for refunds the company allows customers to appeal and each 
case is judged separately critics however say most consumers 
lack the savvy to appeal

the government is giving 389 groups including 
a homosexual rights organization the chance to benefit from 
federal payroll deductions that raise about 160 million a year for 
charity 
frankly it is a thrilling prospect for us thomas stoddard 
executive director of the lambda legal defense and education fund 
said wednesday being listed helps fulfill our mission 
the fund established in 1972 to defend homosexuals and 
homosexual rights in court was one of 19 groups that received 
lastminute approval for inclusion it is the first overtly 
homosexual organization to be included in the government list 
i assume frankly that there was simply a desire to keep 
lambda out of the circle by virtue of its mission stoddard said 
about the earlier rejection 
the drive the combined federal campaign is the nations 
largest single fundraising campaign 
getting listed can bring large amounts to an organization at 
virtually no cost but it also can bring nothing if federal 
employees dont specifically designate the charity 
workers are allowed to choose up to five charities from a list 
that including local charities may number more than 1000 
other participants in this years drive are antiabortion and 
proabortion rights groups ralph naders center for auto safety 
phyllis schlaflys eagle forum educational amp legal defense fund 
the liberal people for the american way and the american civil 
liberties union foundation 
among those rejected were the red river valley fighter pilots 
association trout unlimited and cultural survival inc 
former president reagan issued a 1983 executive order 
restricting the federal drive to traditional health and welfare 
charities after protests and lawsuits by advocacy groups congress 
enacted legislation in 1986 broadening the grounds for admission 
but left discretion in the hands of the director of the office of 
personnel management 
opm director constance newman reviewed rejected applications and 
reversed the decision on lambda and 18 others opm said wednesday 
in announcing the list 
she gave qualified approval to eight more left six pending and 
denied approval to 55 of which 33 had not complied with requests 
for additional information 
approval went to a range of causes some potentially 
controversial 
among them were the firearms civil rights legal defense fund 
the united palestinian appeal human life international the 
national association of black law enforcement executives united 
states military sports association the living bank and operation 
california 
the national right to life educational trust fund the religious 
coalition for abortion rights education fund and planned 
parenthoodworld population already were listed so was the 
national right to work legal defense foundation inc a 
conservative group 
the fund drive raises about 160 million annually from 4 million 
federal employees including military people and postal workers 
with the average giving 6068 
it is the largest employee solicitation in the country opm 
said although it collects just a fraction of what americans 
individually give to church or charity 87 billion in 1988 
according to the american association of fundraising counsel 
about 80 percent of the gifts are designated of the rest 82 
percent goes to local united way campaigns 7 percent to a group of 
33 international service agencies 7 percent to national health 
agencies and 4 percent to local groups according to opm

citicorp has agreed on a preliminary basis to 
buy and lease about 20 floors of a new office tower in hong kong in 
a move described by a bank official as a vote of confidence in the 
territorys future 
new yorkbased citicorp also will arrange 667 million in loans 
to help finance construction of the twintower complex project 
leader great eagle co announced wednesday 
the british colony reverts to chinese sovereignty in 1997 the 
military suppression of prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing in 
early june and the subsequent crackdown on dissent in china has 
damaged confidence in the territorys future 
securities analysts praised the news saying that providing 
space to citicorp would help set a base for rents in the downtown 
building and lock in a wellknown anchor tenant to help fill the 
complex 
citicorp also would benefit by acquiring a significantly higher 
profile in hong kong its local headquarters now is far from 
downtown 
preliminary work on the construction site has begun and the 
complex is expected to be completed in less than four years 
steven baker citicorps division executive for east asia said 
the bank had been looking for a downtown location for three years 
the bank plans to take about 400000 square feet or onequarter 
of the new complex 
our commitment to finance this enormous office complex and our 
serious negotiations to both anchor the space and invest as an 
equity participant reflect our confidence in hong kong and our 
determination to play an increasingly important role in the 
community he said

for years many elite colleges and universities 
have cooperated to figure out amounts of financial aid they should 
give to students but now federal antitrust investigators are 
investigating the practice 
justice department officials wednesday acknowledged an 
investigation was under way but refused to disclose details 
antitrust division investigations are not a matter of public 
record agency spokesman david runkel said 
financial aid for college students totaled some 26 billion last 
year said kathleen brouder head of college scholarship service 
information services in new york 
she noted that colleges began working together in the 1950s 
when the sovietus space race set off a flurry of scholarship 
loan and grantgiving by governments and institutions seeking to 
beef up american education 
the schools objective has been to avoid bidding wars for 
students ms brouder said 
there was intense bidding and people were concerned about the 
fact that aid might be going in amounts that didnt need to go to 
people and they were very concerned about scarce institutional 
resources ms brouder said 
the justice department would not comment on what prompted the 
investigation 
on may 2 the wall street journal reported the practice by 23 
elite schools of meeting formally once a year to decide how much 
each applicant for aid could afford 
this is how it hypothetically works yale decides the smiths can 
pay 3000 toward daughter joans education but dartmouths aid 
formula reckons the smiths can only afford 2000 the two schools 
then work out the difference until they agree on a figure say 
2900 when joan smith receives acceptance letters from yale and 
dartmouth they both say she can receive financial aid short of 
2900 
this year more than 10000 high school seniors and their 
families were subject to this arrangement the journal said 
schools named in this practice massachusetts institute of 
technology brown columbia cornell dartmouth harvard the 
university of pennsylvania princeton yale amherst barnard 
bowdoin bryn mawr colby mount holyoke middlebury smith 
trinity tufts vassar wellesley wesleyan and williams 
many schools on that list said wednesday they were not the 
subject of an investigation others including harvard the 
university of chicago and tufts university declined to comment on 
how they figure financial aid 
but william cotter president of colby college in waterville 
maine said the probe appears to revolve around the possible fixing 
of salaries fees tuition and financialaid requirements 
he denied colby was fixing costs with other schools there is 
absolutely no agreement on salary and tuition cotter said we 
compete vigorously with one another for students we compete 
vigorously for faculty 
like other officials at schools contacted amherst college 
spokeswoman terry allen said we believe we are in compliance 
with the law but if it is determined that we are not we will do 
everything to comply

congress is being advised that cooperation by 
other countries could bring the united states only 10 billion 
closer to balancing its worldwide accounts by 1994 and that the 
cooperation would be hard if not impossible to get 
the congressional budget office is estimating that under 
present laws the united states will spend 75 billion more in 
other countries than it takes in from them in 1994 for this year 
the figure is 129 billion 
these are estimates of the current account deficit the widest 
measure of income and outgo it includes not only trade in goods 
but money spent for services such as banking and airline fares and 
money paid out as interest on debt 
the total is what the united states has to borrow from other 
countries 
policies for reducing the currentaccount deficit the 
report made public wednesday suggests that the deficit could be 
brought down most by cutting government spending and increasing the 
money supply 
its calculation is based on a spending cut that amounts to 1 
percent of the total that the united states produces that is 
more than 40 billion it suggests a 4 percent increase in the 
supply of money 
those changes would reduce the 75 billion deficit by 299 
billion in 1994 it figures 
on top of that it looks at what would happen if other countries 
also increase their money supply by 4 percent and increase their 
government spending by 1 percent instead of cutting it 
such increases would provide the additional 10 billion cut in 
the us international balance bringing it down to 451 billion 
in 1994 
but stephan thurman an analyst in the office called the 
suggestions for other countries action unrealistic 
many foreign industrial countries are facing inflationary 
pressures that could well be exacerbated by fiscal and monetary 
stimulation designed to reduce current account imbalances in the 
united states the report said 
other countries for example japan and west germany are 
also striving to reduce budget deficits as a means of increasing 
national saving as they prepare for changes that will 
significantly increase the number of retired people in coming 
decades 
the report said cooperation of the kind suggested is more likely 
if newly industrializing countries such as brazil hong kong 
malaysia mexico the philippines singapore south korea and 
taiwan are excluded 
it pointed out that these governments have their own policy 
objectives for example while the price of the dollar has been 
going down in the currencies in other industrial countries this 
has been allowed to occur only recently by some third world 
countries in terms of their own money 
if these eight are left out of the calculations the additional 
reduction in the us deficit would amount to only 29 billion in 
1994 the report calculated

gen colin l powell in line to become the 
first black chairman of the joint chiefs of staff is a man of 
exceptional judgment who never gets rattled associates say 
bush administration sources said the president was expected to 
nominate powell today to become the nations top military officer 
the position would require senate confirmation 
powell 52 the former white house national security adviser is 
credited with helping restructure the national security council 
following the irancontra scandal he now heads the us army 
forces command at fort macpherson ga which is charged with 
keeping us troops ready for combat 
the son of jamaican immigrants powell is the fourth black to 
achieve the rank of fourstar general 
he is a person of exceptional judgment and intellect said 
charles duncan deputy defense secretary under president carter 
said in november 1987 when powell was named to succeed frank 
carlucci as national security adviser 
gen px kelley who worked with powell in the pentagon before 
retiring as commandant of the marine corps once described him as 
a very extraordinary guy 
he can handle stress extremely well he never gets rattled he 
was always a cool head kelley said 
and carlucci has said i think he should go to the very top of 
the military establishment up to and including chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff 
a tall husky man powell collects and repairs old volvos in his 
spare time he also visits groups of young blacks to tell them of 
their duty to help others and to protect the gains of the civil 
rights movement 
dont squander the blood sweat and tears of those who paved 
the way for you he told clark atlanta university graduates this 
spring the greatest danger is complacency 
he speaks without bitterness of the occasional racial harassment 
he suffered during the mid1960s as a young officer at fort 
benning ga friends say he distinguished himself as the best 
infantry instructor at benning and in vietnam won a bronze star 
and a purple heart he also has received the distinguished service 
medal and the legion of merit 
the watershed in his career may have been a white house 
fellowship he won in 1972 he was assigned to the office of 
management and budget where he worked for caspar weinberger and 
carlucci 
later as military assistant to defense secretary weinberger 
powell was intimately involved in the 1983 grenada invasion and the 
libyan bombing of 1986 
powell then commanded a corps in germany and refused several 
requests to become carluccis deputy national security adviser he 
finally gave in to a personal appeal by president reagan and 
explained in january 1987 im a serviceman a soldier and it 
looked like my service might be of greater use here 
powell came under scrutiny in the irancontra affair because he 
was one of the few people who knew about the secret sale of arms to 
iran however it did not hurt his reputation and he was never 
accused of wrongdoing 
a congressional source who spoke in 1987 on condition of 
anonymity said powell opposed the arms sales but when the 
decision was made by the president reagan he executed it 
in a speech last november powell was cautious about prospects 
for change in the soviet union arguing against a help 
gorbachev policy at a conference organized by the american stock 
exchange 
will perestroika lead to a kinder gentler soviet union 
he said we cannot forget that our overall relationship 
continues to be both competitive and adversarial this is unlikely 
to change within our lifetimes 
powell met his wife alma on a blind date in 1962 and they 
have two daughters and a son

peter watson resisted war when it was 
neither chic nor acceptable he thought world war ii was a terrible 
mistake and became a conscientious objector 
now hes attacking war by financing peace 
the 64yearold real estate investor has pledged 1 million to 
the university of rochester in new york to establish a center to 
study peace 
we have three good academies teaching people how to wage 
war watson said referring to west point annapolis and the air 
force academy we need to have institutions of higher learning 
teaching people how to wage peace 
america was already at war when watson entered harvard 
university as a freshman he saw many of his classmates and his two 
brothers go off to fight but he simply believed war was 
meaningless and wrong 
so after being drafted in 1942 he opted for alternative 
service he eventually volunteered for the guinea pig unit a 
group of conscientious objectors who were used to test the bodys 
tolerance to high altitude extreme temperature and different 
proteins 
one of his duties was to test the limits of his body under 
desertlike conditions he rode a stationary bicycle in a room 
heated to a sweltering 120 to 130 degrees for eight hours without 
water the salt water solution he was given at the end of the day 
was delicious 
watson said his guinea pig years were fulfilling so he thinks 
it only fitting to give the money to the rochester ny 
university the site of the experiments 
dr carl honig a researcher at the university of rochester 
said the work in respiratory study saved the lives of soldiers 
stationed in the aleutian islands and north africa and thousands 
of others since then 
those studies have prolonged the life and added to comfort of 
patients with any type of respiratory disease whether its 
emphysema or asthma or lung cancer honig said 
no one died during any of the rochester experiments but at 
least two men perished during guinea pig exercises elsewhere 
watson said 
its important for every generation to have some people 
however visionary and impractical at the time stand for something 
stand for the abolition of war honig said those people did it 
at great risk 
watson got a medical discharge after developing ulcers during 
nutritional experiments aimed at trying to avert starvation 
following the war he went back to harvards medical school for two 
years before dropping out to volunteer for more research and to 
conduct research himself 
in 1962 seeing an opportunity he moved to vermont and invested 
in real estate when land could be had for 1 an acre 
but after suffering a stroke in 1979 watson found himself with 
time on his hands he sought information on the results of his 
units wartime research and eventually talked to honig about a 
center that could unite various academic disciplines including 
history philosophy and political science in the study of peace 
peace is breaking out all over the world he said lets 
nudge it along a little bit 
rochester officials proposed the peter d watson center for the 
study of international peace and cooperation and agreed to raise 5 
million for it 
watson seems more the successful capitalist than the longhaired 
peacenik a prominent stainedglass window with an american eagle 
motif hangs beside the balcony of his home overlooking greensboros 
caspian lake and he keeps rifles that have been in a family that 
has gone to war since the american revolution 
but watson said the window is not there to show patriotism he 
just liked the design and the weapons well they seem to serve as 
reminders of a history that need not be repeated 
peace has to be made reputable and war disreputable watson 
said

for the dozen or so people who have dual 
ussoviet citizenship their american passports have not 
necessarily been a ticket out of the soviet union 
yuri semenenko for example took a fiveyear detour through 
soviet prison camps 
in the era of glasnost the us embassy in moscow is besieged 
by tens of thousands of soviets who want to become americans in 
their midst is a much smaller group 12 or so who can claim to 
be dual citizens 
semenenko the son of a soviet military officer on assignment 
during world war ii is an american citizen by virtue of his birth 
in wilcox memorial hospital in portland ore on feb 10 1945 
all he wants to do is go back to portland with his wife elena a 
young dancer who is to due to give birth to their first child in 
midseptember 
id like it very much if my child was born in portland but i 
see that it wont happen said the leningrad resident a tanned 
tennis fanatic who also was a ranking soviet motocross racer as a 
teenager 
its simply a fact of life that hes here said an embassy 
official familiar with semenenkos case you cant claim us 
constitutional protection when youre in a foreign country 
other dual citizens also were born in the united states and 
emigrated with their parents to czechoslovakia poland or the 
baltic republics during the depression said the officials who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the areas they lived in were absorbed by the soviet union after 
world war ii and during the cold war they hid their american 
birthright a handful of dual citizens mostly in their 60s and 
70s came forward only recently 
semenenkos saga was different his father capt 3rd rank 
mikhail semenenko was in the united states in 1943 to inspect a 
ship being sent to the soviet union under a lendlease program his 
wife tatyana went with him 
near the end of their tour yuri was born several months later 
the family got on a boat for the soviet far east 
all the family brought back was perhaps 100 postcards of 
portland new york washington dc chicago and other cities as 
well as a few other souvenirs little remains 
when i was a boy i liked giving them to my friends 
semenenko said ruefully i sold some of them too we were poor 
when i was growing up 
but under us law since his parents did not have diplomatic 
status in the united states semenenko was entitled to american 
citizenship it took until 1980 when jewish emigration to the 
united states had peaked for him to figure that out 
when he approached the us consulate in leningrad soviet 
guards arrested him at the entrance he was convicted of bribery 
and hooliganism charges semenenko said police concocted to punish 
him for seeking his us passport 
semenenko was sentenced to 6 years in a prison camp above the 
arctic circle where he said inside temperatures rarely exceeded 50 
degrees 
five years later in spring 1988 semenenko was released in a 
period of reform he again applied for his us passport and 
received it last march 
but officials told him that to leave he had to send a letter to 
the presidium of the supreme soviet renouncing his soviet 
citizenship he did that in april and is awaiting a reply 
us officials say they bring up cases like semenenkos every 
time they meet with representatives of the soviet foreign 
ministrys office of humanitarian affairs but visa offices are 
under another ministry and its slow going through the bureacracy 
the soviets have promised such cases will be resolved 
immediately under new regulations that have been expected for 
months but still have not been implemented 
meanwhile semenenko contemplates life in the united states 
people ask me what what ill do over there i tell them ill 
wash dishes said semenenko who can sprinkle his russian 
conversation with english i know that if i go to america ill 
live worse than i do now i wont have my own house and ill have 
to work several times harder 
but he said he does not have confidence in the soviet reforms 
and will never feel comfortable living in the soviet union

the organizer of what is being billed 
as the largest rubber duck race ever is miffed that rhode island 
wont allow the ducks in its waters 
great american duck races predicts up to 50000 people will turn 
out to watch 70000 rubber ducks race down a salt river project 
canal in scottsdale nov 4 
the phoenixbased group has organized ducks for bucks races 
in more than 40 states since may 1988 with nary a quack of 
protest says eric schechter the organizations president the 
average race raises about 100000 for charities with companies 
and individuals paying to sponsor ducks he said but the ducks 
wont be racing down any rhode island rivers anytime soon 
the states department of environmental management has banned 
the races claiming they violate the federal clean water act and in 
rhode islands freshwater wetlands laws 
there is no way in the world you can collect all these little 
pieces of plastic no matter how well organized you are said 
stephanie powell a department spokeswoman officials also say the 
races attract large crowds that trample the riverbanks 
schechter dismisses the concerns though the buoyant rubber 
ducks are checked for toxicity before being used in races or sold 
as souvenirs and people in kayaks scoop up all the ducks when the 
contests are over he says 
we take this seriously because we are concerned about the 
environment also schechter said rhode island is the only 
state weve had trouble organizing races in

doctors should be allowed to ignore the usual 
standards of brain death in babies born without most of their 
brains so their organs can be used immediately for transplants a 
report concluded today 
these infants known as anencephalic babies cannot survive and 
physicians would like to salvage their hearts livers and other 
organs for other sick babies but these organs usually cannot be 
used because they are damaged by lack of oxygen before the babies 
are pronounced dead 
our proposal asserts that the anencephalic infant is not 
alive wrote dr robert d truog of harvard medical school and 
bioethicist john c fletcher of the university of virginia 
their report was one of three papers in the new england journal 
of medicine exploring the ethical and practical issues involved in 
using these babys organs for transplants 
in the same issue drs donald n medearis jr of massachusetts 
general hospital and lewis b holmes of brigham and womens 
hospital in boston countered that current standards requiring 
complete brain death should be retained 
anencephalic infants are alive and the length of their lives 
cannot be predicted accurately they wrote 
they cautioned that making an exception for anencephalic infants 
might eventually lead to taking organs from people with other 
profound medical conditions such as other babies with severe head 
malformations or adults in persistent vegetative states 
anencephalic babies are born with brain stems which control 
breathing and some bodily functions but the rest of their brains 
are missing in current practice doctors must wait until all brain 
stem activity stops before declaring the babies dead 
i think there is a moral obligation to reconsider the issue 
truog said in an interview there are children who die because 
these organs are not being used we need to ask ourselves whether 
on balance we are not doing a greater harm by not using these 
organs 
but medearis and holmes said that these babies would never be a 
major source of organs they estimated that fewer than 200 
anencephalic babies are born alive in the united states annually 
and organs from some cannot be used because of other birth defects 
or difficulties matching organs with potential recipients 
in one approach to the situation doctors at loma linda 
university medical center in california experimented with putting 
anencephalic babies in intensive care to try to keep their organs 
healthy until they died 
in a separate report in the journal they said that six infants 
were put on respirators immediately after birth while six others 
were put on respirators only after death appeared imminent 
but dr joyce l peabody and colleagues said their program was 
impractical because intensive care slowed the dying process and 
the babies lingered for periods up to two months 
although brain death was confirmed within three days of birth in 
two of the loma linda babies their organs were not used for 
transplants 
reasons included the limited number of babies waiting with the 
same blood type the size of the available organs the health of 
the recipient infants and the fear of transplant centers of 
becoming involved in the controversy over using organs from 
anencephalic babies

the labor department has decided that 
individual retirement accounts lose their taxdeferred status if 
banks offer free services in exchange for opening such accounts 
the ruling was made last month after an attorney sought from the 
department an interpretation of the federal pension laws said a 
labor department official who spoke wednesday on the condition he 
not be identified 
the attorney the official said asked the department whether 
federal pension law prohibited a bank from offering free checking 
to an individual who opened an ira and then invested 2000 of the 
accounts assets in bank financial products such as certificates of 
deposit 
the department in an interpretation issued july 14 informed 
the attorney that such an arrangement violated provisions of 
federal pension law that prohibit fiduciaries of retirement funds 
from making decisions that result in their direct financial gain 
in other words the official said the person opening an ira is 
legally considered the fiduciary or trustee of his or her own ira 
and is not allowed to make a decision that would benefit himself or 
herself in this case the free checking would be the benefit the 
official said 
the provision is more commonly applied to large pension plans 
and is designed to prevent abuses of those funds by pension plan 
managers but the labor department official said there is no 
distinction in the law between the large plans and individual 
accounts such as iras 
the official downplayed the significance of the interpretation 
saying it was in line with previous decisions for example he said 
the department in the early 1980s made it clear that banks could 
not offer gifts such as toasters or radios in exchange for opening 
iras and other retirement accounts 
whether its a toaster or free checking i cant see any 
distinction between the two said the official theyre both 
gifts that benefit an individual for whose benefit a retirement 
plan is established 
by accepting such a gift the account would in effect cease to 
be an ira and become taxable the official said 
he said he could not identify the attorney who asked for the 
interpretation 
the department several years ago formed a committee to study 
whether small gifts such as toasters or free services should be 
granted an exemption from the pension laws but the committee has 
not yet concluded its study the official said

one hundred years after mark twain published 
a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court the authors voice 
sounds as fresh as when twain wrote the novel a literary scholar 
says 
he anticipated so much how we talk now that were right at 
home said victor fischer associate editor of the mark twain 
project at the university of california at berkeleys bancroft 
library when you find the familiar things from his sayings and 
his expressions that have entered into the language you realize 
how much hes pervaded the way we talk 
about 150 scholars and twain experts from around the world meet 
today through saturday at elmira college to mark the centennial of 
the publication of a connecticut yankee and to celebrate one of 
americas most enduring writers 
twain wrote some of a connecticut yankee in elmira and is 
buried a little more than a mile away from the elmira college 
campus 
mark twain is our most definitively american writer said 
darryl baskin director of the elmira college center for mark twain 
studies he wrote the way americans spoke and he was very 
much alive to the emergence of popular culture he connected this 
with literature 
marianne curling curator of the mark twain memorial in 
hartford conn said that while a connecticut yankee is not 
twains most popular or successful work it remains relevant today 
it talks about the impact of technology in society she 
said there were a lot of new and different things going on then 
the scariest of which was electricity people either thought 
electricity would cure the ills of society or destroy it its very 
much like people regard nuclear power today 
the book tells about a journey back in time of hank morgan a 
connecticut factory mechanic to the 6th century england of king 
arthur 
twain an avid reader of history originally envisioned the book 
as a sort of burlesque about the customs of the time such as the 
problem a knight in armor might have encountered when he had to 
scratch or blow his nose 
but as his writing progressed it took on a much darker tone 
twains yankee used his knowledge of modern technology to seize 
control of the court and to begin imposing his own customs on the 
land the novel ends with an armageddonlike battle where an army of 
some 10000 knights is slaughtered by electrocution gatling guns 
and drowning 
twain himself admitted that the book slumped into funereal 
seriousness in its latter stages 
everett emerson a twain biographer says a series of personal 
setbacks including the souring of many of the authors 
investments largely accounts for the ominous tone of the final 
twothirds of the novel 
fischer said the reasons for the books change of gears remains 
a source of controversy among literary critics a century later so 
too he said is the message that twain aimed to convey 
the dispute tends to be over whether he was extolling the 19th 
century in contrast with the ignorance and cruelty of ancient times 
or whether in fact he was saying a plague on both your 
houses fischer said there is something of both in the book 
whatever the intent the subject matter is a far cry from what 
twain had given readers previously in such books as roughing 
it innocents abroad and especially the adventures of tom 
sawyer and adventures of huckleberry finn there twain had 
combined humor with an often sharp satirical eye aimed at 
puncturing the pomposities and superstitions of the age 
twain had regarded a connecticut yankee as uncommonly 
bully and predicted it would sell 100000 copies in its first 
year but the book merely continued his financial headaches it 
sold 34000 copies that first year amid mixed reviews and twains 
own publishing company was in such bad financial condition that the 
author received no money for it at all

imelda marcos told a judge she was obsessed with 
taking her ailing husband ferdinand home to the philippines but 
a justice department attorney said if she is allowed to leave 
wed never get her back 
theodore s greenberg acting chief of the departments criminal 
fraud division testified wednesday that the philippines does not 
have an extradition treaty with the united states and that marcos 
loyalists might revolt if the former philippine first lady went 
home and was not allowed to stay 
mrs marcos 60 is challenging a travel ban imposed in june by 
the immigration and naturalization service prohibiting her from 
leaving the united states the hearing continues today before 
william robie the chief us immigration judge 
the marcoses are under us indictment on criminal racketeering 
charges for allegedly stealing more than 100 million from the 
philippine treasury and stashing it in the united states 
the 71yearold former philippine president has been separated 
from the case because of respiratory heart and kidney problems 
that have kept him hospitalized for the past seven months he 
remained in critical condition wednesday 
richard hibey attorney for the marcoses claims the travel ban 
is unnecessary because mrs marcos is prohibited from leaving the 
country under terms of 5 million bail paid after her indictment in 
new york last october 
hibey said that when marcos dies he would ask a new york 
federal judge to allow mrs marcos to accompany his body to the 
philippines for burial as long as she returns to face prosecution 
her obsession to return home is matched only by her obsession 
to defend herself in new york he said 
but greenberg said there was no guarantee she would return the 
government claims the marcoses have billions of dollars in assets 
and the loss of 5 million is not enough to prevent mrs marcos 
from fleeing 
if she went to the philippines in my view wed never get her 
back greenberg said 
mrs marcos greeted at the courthouse by about 100 supporters 
who sang her love songs and gave her flowers testified for two 
hours and broke into tears several times 
she invoked the fifth amendment against selfincrimination about 
30 times usually in response to questions about her familys 
finances or alleged plots to return her husband to power 
my obsession is to go home to my country she said i 
will use all peaceful means to bring ferdinand home 
however charles salmon director of the state departments 
office of philippine affairs testified that the government of 
corazon aquino forbade marcos return dead or alive and that 
commercial and private airlines had been warned of the prohibition

an iranian newspaper said today that 
indirect talks between iran and the united states on the hostage 
crisis will begin within days the official islamic republic news 
agency reported 
the agency monitored in nicosia quoted the englishlanguage 
tehran times as saying in an editorial the talks would be conducted 
through a third country probably pakistan 
political observers believed that in the next few days we 
should expect certain moves towards mediation of course 
unofficially irna quoted the editorial as saying 
it predicted the mediator would be pakistans foreign minister 
sahabzada yaqub khan because both iran and the united states have 
good relations with pakistan no other details were given 
the newspaper which is close to irans presidentelect hashemi 
rafsanjani also quoted an aide as expressing surprise that the 
united states had rejected a proposal that 2 billion in frozen 
iranian assets in us banks be returned in exchange for tehrans 
help in freeing american hostages in lebanon 
rafsanjani is considered a pragmatist who is anxious to rebuild 
ties with the west in order to secure funds and technology to help 
boost the flagging economy 
but the leading hardliner in the hierarchy interior minister 
ali akbar mohtashemi has shown his opposition to any softening of 
irans position on the hostages urging shiite militants to remain 
poised to strike against the united states 
the 16 western hostages are believed held by shiite moslem 
extremist groups under the umbrella of the proiranian hezbollah 
or party of god 
the unnamed aide was quoted as saying iran was reacting to a 
report that president bush had offered to release the iranian 
assets frozen after militants seized the american embassy in 
tehran in 1979 in return for the hostages freedom 
its really strange first the us offers an 
assetsforhostages deal and then the spokesman of the white house 
says that his country is not ready to pay ransom he was quoted 
as saying 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday that the 
united was not willing to link the iranian assets to the hostages 
issue 
the tehran times editorial quoted rafsanjanis aide as adding 
what iran meant was that the move to unfreeze the iranian assets 
would have been taken in iran as a goodwill gesture on behalf of 
the us 
its a clear policy of the islamic republic not to pay or 
receive ransom what iran has said more than once is that 
tehran is ready to cooperate on humanitarian grounds 
bush told reporters wednesday he was willing to talk and to 
exercise every diplomatic channel i can to free the american 
captives but ruled out trading for hostages

prime minister yitzhak shamir and president 
bush agreed to coordinate efforts to release foreign hostages and 
israeli prisoners held in lebanon a shamir aide said today 
the decision came in a 10minute telephone call by shamir to 
bush on wednesday night avi pazner a top aide to shamir 
described the talk as warm and friendly 
it was the first time the two leaders had talked since the 
hostage crisis flared following israels kidnapping of moslem 
cleric sheikh abdel karim obeid from southern lebanon on july 28 
israeli reports said 
a spokeswoman in pazners office said said bush made no mention 
of obeids abduction which the united states has criticized but 
that the two leaders decided it was best to join forces on the 
hostageprisoner issue 
shamir assured bush that israel would include the eight american 
hostages in any deal to trade obeid and other shiite prisoners in 
israels hands for three israeli soldiers held by the proiranian 
hezbollah movement in lebanon pazner said 
the conversation came the same day a shiite suicide attacker set 
off a car bomb near the israeli border in southern lebanon 
wounding five israeli soldiers and one lebanese militiaman 
hezbollah the shadowy proiranian group claimed responsiblity 
for the assault 
one of the wounded israelis was in critical condition today on 
a respirator at rambam hospital in the northern port of haifa the 
others were reported recovering 
israels policy coordinator for southern lebanon uri lubrani 
warned israel would retaliate for the attack 
israel will deal with the hezbollah as it deals with all the 
organizations which threaten the normal life of the security 
zone lubrani said he was referring to a strip north of israels 
border patrolled by israeli soldiers and its allies the south 
lebanon army militia 
violence has two edges and israel will retaliate in one way or 
another lubrani said in due time in a place it will choose 
ron benishai a wellknown commentator on defense issues said 
the government was caught in a dilemma over whether to stage a 
reprisal at a time when there may be hope for hostage negotiations 
the negotiations are at initial states and israel will be 
blamed by the united states for torpedoing them or runs such a 
risk benishai said on israel radio 
defense minister yitzhak rabins spokesman denied a report in 
the kuwaiti alseyassah daily which said israel had abducted obeid 
to sabotage a plo plan to win freedom for the american hostages 
that was endorsed by the united states 
israel boycotts the palestine liberation organization which it 
considers a terrorist group and has repeatedly protested us 
contacts with the plo 
rabins spokesman eitan haber reached by telephone said the 
kuwaiti report was nonsense

us forces blockaded the entrance to 
fort amador after panamanian forces arrested two american soldiers 
and the standoff ended three hours later when both sides exchanged 
arrested troops 
us military officials blamed wednesdays confrontation the 
second in as many days on the arrests of the american soldiers and 
strongly protested the action 
the panamanian defense forces in turn condemned the blockade 
during which panamanian troops trained antiaircraft weapons on 
us helicopters circling overhead 
the defense forces under strongman gen manuel antonio noriega 
accused the united states of trying to humiliate us in our own 
home and said panama would not respond to provocation 
fort amador is at the southern entrance to the panama canal and 
includes barracks for panamanian troops the southern command 
offices a us naval station and a golf course used by american 
personnel noriega commander of the defense forces and panamas de 
facto ruler has offices at the fort 
wednesdays confrontation was the latest of several between us 
and panamanian forces american troops have held exercises that 
amounted to shows of force several times during the past few 
months parking armored personnel carriers across the street from 
noriegas office 
sources said noriega was not at fort amador on wednesday when 
the confrontation occurred 
the incident began when a us military policeman was arrested 
in the panama city neighborhood of el chorillo near the general 
staff headquarters of the panamanian defense forces us army col 
ronald sconyers said 
that soldier was taken to a panamanian installation at fort 
amador where another us military policeman was arrested when he 
tried to get his fellow soldier released 
panamanian military sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
confirmed sconyers account but neither they nor maj edgardo 
lopez a spokesman for the defense forces gave a reason for the 
initial arrest 
us troops then arrested two panamanian military policemen at 
the gates to the fort and an army detachment that included five 
armored personnel carriers blocked the entrance helicopters 
circled overhead with panamanian soldiers training antiaircraft 
guns on them 
civilians including reporters were allowed across the line 
during the blockade but not panamanian soldiers 
finally after three hours reporters watched as us and 
panamanian officers met and exchanged prisoners after which the 
us troops withdrew 
us southern command officials strongly protested the actions 
of members of the panamanian defense forces who arbitrarily 
arrested two us military policemen said a statement issued by 
the command 
the arrests was seen as possible retaliation for the arrest of 
29 panamanians on tuesday by us troops the southern command said 
the panamanians who were released after 75 minutes had entered a 
military area without permission 
the southern command statement said it reinforced its forces 
at fort amador during the incident because us forces are 
responsible for internal security there and to protect us lives 
and installations in panama 
lopez said the panamanian military wont be trapped into 
provocation despite the actions by the us troops 
us officials have said they plan to enforce full us rights 
under the 1977 panama canal treaties and to use shows of force to 
underline noriegas inability to prevent american troops from going 
where they wish 
the united states has been trying to oust noriega since he was 
indicted on drug trafficking and money laundering charges in us 
federal courts last year 
noriega has denied the charges and said they were part of a us 
plot to abrogate treaties that turn the canal over to panama at the 
end of 1999 
he has fought off all us efforts to force him to quit 
including economic sanctions 
the government annulled elections last may that international 
observers said were won 31 by the opposition 
government parties have been trying to arrange some 
accommodation by the time acting president manuel solis palmas 
term ends sept 1 but the opposition has said noriega must agree 
to step down 
the un security council has scheduled debate for friday on 
panamas complaint that the united states is trying to undermine 
its government 
last month brig gen henry cisneros commander of us army 
south told the associated press in an interview that he personally 
thought the united states should oust noriega by force if that was 
the only way to remove him from power

arson is suspected in a rooming house fire in 
which at least three people were killed in this boston suburb 
officials combed through the rubble of the burnedout ben crest 
plaza wednesday in search of the bodies of two people who are 
missing and also believed victims of the fire 
it is the conclusion of the investigators that this incident 
should be investigated with regard to a possible arsonhomicide 
said essex county district attorney howard whitehead 
whitehead said a connecticut state police dog trained to sniff 
for gasoline kerosene and other fire accelerants had been helpful 
in gathering evidence which was being analyzed at a laboratory 
joe mckenney 24 who watched the blaze from his home in an 
adjacent apartment building claimed he saw a man in one of the ben 
crests rooms playing with matches and what he thought was rubbing 
alcohol 
right in the middle of the floor he was fooling around 
with alcohol mckenney said i saw him with it playing with 
matches 
but bobby barrett 19 who was in the room mckenney was watching 
about the time the blaze erupted said no one was playing with fire 
fire marshal joseph okeefe said his investigators also were 
trying to determine if the buildings fire alarm was operating by 
tracing its circuitry and if an antiquated substandard 
sprinkler system was functioning 
tenants wearing nightclothes jumped from windows tuesday to 
escape the flames and swung down on ropes provided by management as 
fire escapes more than 19 tenants and rescuers were injured

the contra chief of staff and eight other top 
nicaraguan rebels requested political asylum in the united states 
but said they were not running because of the central american pact 
to disband antisandinista forces 
immigration and naturalization service officials said wednesday 
that three of the requests were approved but their names were not 
released 
perry rivkind ins district director in miami said the claims 
were given special action status and reviewed on the spot ins 
officials said the other six requests were being given top priority 
the applications came two days after five central american 
presidents signed an accord in tela honduras calling for the 
dismantling of the contras within four months nicaraguan president 
daniel ortega said the pact marks the death of the rebel movement 
but the rebel officers denied their asylum requests were linked 
to the accord 
israel galeano the rebel chief of staff known as comandante 
franklin told the miami herald the group sought asylum to obtain 
travel documents and werent planning to move to the united states 
some of us have the need right now to mobilize in the 
international field said galeano there is a need to get 
documents to travel 
he promised to continue the fight with limitless human 
resources and said he would return to nicaragua if the contras 
are kicked out of honduras 
a contra political adviser who requested asylum said the 
requests could send a misleading signal to the estimated 12000 
rebel troops languishing in border camps in honduras 
it could be demoralizing to the troops if we were seen as 
retiring from the struggle francisco johnny delgadillo said 
but the troops know thats not so our struggle continues 
delgadillo also expressed anger over the tela agreement 
we dont want to live like slaves to the signature of the 
presidents he said we want to go on being rebels 
ortegas sandinista government has agreed to democratic reforms 
leading to national elections in exchange for the repatriation or 
resettlement of the contras by dec 8 
while the bush administration lobbied to keep the contras intact 
until nicaraguas scheduled elections in february 1990 washington 
officials have reluctantly embraced the accord military aid to the 
rebels was cut off by congress in febraury 1988 
a complete list of the nine commanders was not immediately made 
public but others known to have to have requested asylum included 
jose emmanuel aguilar a southern commander fremio jimmy

emperor akihito today held a swearingin ceremony 
for new prime minister toshiki kaifu and his cabinet a group kaifu 
said had been chosen to help ensure a balance of voices from the 
people as he seeks reforms 
there are both political reform and tax reform and i plan to 
do both reliably he said 
kaifu 58 and his scandalplagued liberal democratic party face 
an oppositiondominated upper house of parliament for the first 
time in the partys 34 years of governing japan 
also for the first time the cabinet includes two women sumiko 
takahara a nonpolitician and economics specialist who is head of 
the economic planning agency and lawmaker mayumi moriyama 
director of the environment agency 
women have been particularly angered by a new 3 percent sales 
tax that the liberal democrats forced through parliament last year 
and were seen as a major factor in the partys upper house defeat 
july 23 
kaifu replaces sousuke uno who served only 69 days as prime 
minister before resigning to take responsibility for the election 
losses he also had been accused of keeping paid mistresses 
if the opposition parties can form a coalition on key issues 
such as abolishing an unpopular new sales tax the liberal 
democrats could be forced into concessions or a possible 
legislative stalemate which could force early elections for the 
lower house 
the liberal democrats hope kaifus administration can brighten 
their image before those elections which must be held by next july 
at the latest 
the opposition parties used their greater powers on wednesday by 
making socialist party chairwoman takako doi the upper houses 
choice for prime minister 
the lower house voted for kaifu the newly chosen leader of the 
liberal democrats and under the constitution the lower house 
decision prevails 
after its induction in a ceremony at the imperial palace the 
new cabinet held its first meeting today 
kaifu pledged tuesday to reduce the influence of factions among 
the liberal democrats but other posts in the 20member cabinet 
were carefully distributed among the main subgroups within the 
party 
i want to let lots of fresh air in kaifu said of his 
government after jogging in his neighborhood this morning 
by listening to the voice of the people i hope to reduce the 
gap between the people and nagatacho he said referring to the 
government office area in tokyo 
for that reason i chose people from outside government and to 
ensure a balance of voices from the people i highlighted the 
appointment of women kaifu added 
he said the cabinets motto would be dialogue and reform 
kaifu was chosen to lead the partys rebuilding efforts because 
of his relative youth and reform credentials however analysts say 
enthusiasm within the party for reform has weakened now that the 
recruit influencebuying scandal is largely over 
kaifu has acknowledged receiving about 110000 in political 
donations from recruit co but said they were legally reported 
four other members of the new cabinet and two new top party 
officials also have said they received recruit contributions 
the company has been accused of giving political donations and 
selling bargainpriced stock to leading politicians to obtain 
favors 
kaifu must negotiate with opposition parties over a revision of 
the sales tax that will acceptable to the public and he must decide 
how to respond to continuing us trade demands 
opposition from farmers a traditional source of governing party 
support to more agricultural imports also was seen as factor in 
the liberal democrats loss in the upper house elections 
kaifu probably will visit the united states in early september 
to meet with us leaders kyodo news service reported 
it quoted unidentified foreign ministry officials as saying 
kaifu would assure president bush that there will be no major 
changes in japanese foreign policy

a master forger duped galleries with phony 
picassos dalis and chagalls until one of the artists he copied 
recognized a counterfeit prosecutors say 
district attorney ira reiner on wednesday credited artist hiro 
yamagata with the break that led to the arrest of anthony tetro 
the forger in this case is the single largest forger of 
artwork in the united states said reiner telling of a yearlong 
undercover investigation that resulted in the seizure of 250 
counterfeit paintings 
reiner spoke against a colorful backdrop of paintings that 
mimicked those of salvador dali pablo picasso marc chagall and 
yamagata 
tetro 39 of claremont was arrested last month and freed on 
10000 bail on charges of conspiracy to commit grand theft and 44 
counts of forgery 
charged along with him is mark henry sawicki 31 an art dealer 
who ran a gallery in sherman oaks and allegedly distributed tetros 
forgeries to galleries in beverly hills new york chicago and boca 
raton fla 
reiner said tetro who drove a rolls royce sold forgeries for 
20000 apiece 
the alleged scheme crumbled last year when yamagata a 
34yearold japaneseborn artist who lives in bel air stopped at a 
gallery while taking relatives from japan on a tour of beverly 
hills yamagata said 
i didnt paint that yamagata exclaimed when relatives 
excitedly told him his paintings were on display 
yamagata whose watercolors sell for 6000 and up went to 
police investigators posed as art buyers and swept through 
galleries across the country placing deposits on artworks then 
returning to seize the frauds reiner said 
two of the phony paintings were recovered from japan reiner 
said indicating the forgery network may have been international 
no galleries were charged reiner said they apparently were 
unaware that the paintings were forgeries 
even the most sophisticated and honest gallery can be duped 
he said 
yamagata who speaks halting english said he has been painting 
since he was 7 and has worked since then to develop his distinctive 
style 
of the alleged forger he said i hope he finds his own 
style

hundreds of eastern airlines pilots 
have crossed the picket line since the fivemonthold strike began 
giving eastern confidence it can meet its goal of 1700 pilots for 
its new schedule 
the crossovers have come despite a union vote this week to stay 
on strike as long as easterns current management controls the 
airline 
at least 365 prestrike eastern pilots have returned to work 
100 to 150 of them since monday according to company and union 
officials all but 220 of easterns 3500 pilots joined a strike by 
easterns machinists launched march 4 
during the walkout eastern has borrowed crews from continental 
airlines which like eastern is owned by texas air corp 
but if pilots continue to stream back the miamibased carrier 
may be able to rebound alone 
our needs are being met and we will fill our pilot quota of 
1700 pilots said eastern spokesman robin matell theres not 
any question that we will be able to meet our schedule 
the union has kept the airline to 30 percent of its prestrike 
schedule of more than 1100 daily departures easterns goal is 800 
daily departures by 1990 the airline expects to have 390 daily 
departures next tuesday 
ron cole a spokesman for the striking pilots maintained that 
the union isnt overly concerned with the crossovers 
the returning pilots are creating a nightmare for eastern 
he said 
cole said that the pilots who are returning are not qualified to 
fly aircraft eastern has available and that friction between newly 
hired pilots and returning pilots will hurt safety in the cockpit 
we anticipate that a lot of the new hires will be leaving 
cole said 
eastern said relations between the former strikers and the new 
pilots have been friendly

six people were killed and 25 wounded 
today when syrian and christian forces exchanged artillery fire in 
a barrage that pounded the residence of the christian army 
commander and moslem neighborhoods 
police said gunners deployed in the druse mountains southeast of 
beirut fired 240mm mortar rounds at the bombdamaged presidential 
palace of the christian commander gen michel aoun in baabda a 
beirut suburb the attack came one day after aoun urged moscow to 
suspend arms supplies to syria 
the syrian barrage also targeted the headquarters of aouns 
20000 mostlty christian troops at the defense ministry in the 
nearby yarze suburb said a police spokesman who requested 
anonymity in line with standing rules 
an aoun spokesman refused to say whether the commander was in 
the palace but he is known to spend most of his time in its 
underground bunker 
aouns gunners deployed in the 310squaremile christian 
enclave northeast of beirut responded by shelling syrian artillery 
emplacements in the moslem druse suburbs of choueifat and the aley 
mountain resort 
police said at least six people were killed and 25 wounded in 
the barrage that started around 11 am shattering two days of 
relative calm across the syrianchristian confrontation lines in 
and around beirut 
the spokesman said no casualties were reported from the defense 
ministry or the presidential palace both damaged by previous 
syrian shelling all personnel there work from bomb shelters 
by police count the fivemonth confrontation has killed 555 
people and wounded 1347 
beirut took the brunt of devastating shelling duels that have 
forced all but 200000 of its 15 million population to seek refuge 
in safer areas in south lebanon the bekaa valley and the 
northeastern mountain resorts 
the thuds of exploding shells echoed across the divided capital 
as moslem and christian radio stations interrupted programs to 
flash reports of the renewed shelling and to advise people to take 
shelter at once 
the police spokesman said moslem and christian civil defense 
organizations ordered all their rescue teams on alert and canceled 
vacations 
women carrying bags of vegetables bread and bottles of drinking 
water ran for shelter across west beiruts hamra commercial 
thoroughfare some of them with tears in their eyes 
i shouldnt have left home in the first place one woman 
said as she dashed into a residential building near a syrian army 
outpost at the warravaged commodore hotel off hamra 
do you have a bomb shelter she asked the janitor yes 
he replied but the woman left after noticing a syrian soldier 
guarding the hotel entrance 
she realized we might get shelled because the syrians are our 
neighbors said the janitor who refused to give his name 
shortly after noon the exchange expanded to residential 
districts of moslem west beirut and the citys eastern christian 
sector the police spokesman said shells were exploding in the 
moslem districts of tarik jedideh and corniche mazraa as well as in 
the christian district of ashrafiyeh 
the current round in lebanons 14year civil war began march 8 
two days after aoun blockaded illegal ports run by syrianallied 
militias south of beirut to salvage 100 million annually in lost 
customs dues 
the syrians and their allies retaliated by shelling and 
besieging the christian enclave home for 1 million people

an advocate of abortion rights has 
apparently won the republican nomination for a state assembly seat 
over five abortion opponents with the counting of most absentee 
ballots completed 
tricia hunter had 14822 votes or 196 more than her closest gop 
rival richard lyles after 532 absentee ballots were counted 
wednesday about 135 more ballots were to be counted today not 
enough to affect the outcome 
the election tuesday to fill a seat left empty by the death of a 
legislator in june was the first state race since the us supreme 
court ruling last month giving states more latitude in restricting 
abortions 
i think the statement that came out of this race is that 
voters want to know the candidates position and they are not going 
to let them waffle their position hunter said 
the candidates are going to have to take one side of the issue 
or the other ive been prochoice for a long time and i believe 
its an individual decision that a woman has the right to make 
unless hunters apparent victory is somehow overturned she will 
advance to an oct 3 election against democrat jeannine correia 
who bested one other democrat in tuesdays voting both democrats 
support abortion rights 
the district is largely republican 54 percent to 33 percent 
democrat making the gop candidate an overwhelming favorite 
i believe the abortion issue was the deciding factor in this 
election said correia 
voters were free to pick from among six republicans and two 
democrats on one ballot 
if one of the eight had won 50 percent of the vote he or she 
would have won outright instead there will be runoff between the 
top votegetter from each party

a freighter carrying a container of toxic waste 
left britain today after the countrys largest port refused to 
accept the cargo and officials at a second port said they would not 
accept the shipment 
authorities at tilbury at the mouth of the thames river 
wednesday blocked the unloading of a container of polychlorinated 
biphenyls or pcbs from canada carried aboard a soviet freighter 
a port spokesman john mcnab said the decision was made out 
of consideration for the work force and the local community 
members of the environmental group greenpeace had met the ship 
khudozhnik saryan and placed poison warning labels on the hull as 
it entered the port 
later wednesday authorities at liverpool said they would reject 
1800 tons of pcb waste expected from canada in the next few months 
the khudozhnik saryan discharged all of its cargo except the 
single container containing the pcbs 
the ship left tilbury early this morning for an unknown 
destination port officials said it was returning to montreal but 
some british news reports said it would first stop in another 
unidentified european country 
sue adams of greenpeace said the group will track the ships 
course and alert environmentalists in belgium if there were any 
attempt to unload the container there 
pcbs are disposed of by burning but there is a danger that 
highly toxic dioxin can be formed if the temperature is not high 
enough 
paul horsman director of the greenpeace toxic unit called on 
the government to revoke the licences of companies bringing such 
waste into britain the uk is becoming the dumping ground of the 
world horsman said 
allan roberts the labor partys spokesman on the environment in 
the house of commons said britain accepted 800000 tons of toxic 
waste last year 
however david boyd of the national association of waste 
disposal contractors said the figure was 80000 tons it is a 
legitimate trade that is to the benefit of the environment as a 
whole boyd said

old faithful is losing steam according to 
a yellowstone national park geologist who says the geyser may some 
day shut off 
the interval between eruptions has lengthened by about 14 
minutes in recent years said rick hutchinson 
the geologist said in an interview tuesday with the jackson hole 
news that there was no way to predict when the geyser might stop 
erupting but that scientists can tell from its cone that old 
faithful has been dormant in the past 
there could come a day in the far distant future or not too 
distant future when old faithful will become less faithful and may 
become a dormant geyser agreed yellowstone spokeswoman joan 
anzelmo 
hutchinson who has monitored geysers in the park for years 
said that for the first 100 years since old faithfuls discovery in 
1870 the average interval between eruptions was 65 minutes last 
spring it was 789 minutes 
earthquakes vandalism and a buildup of natural deposits called 
geyserite all can slow a geyser down 
after a 1959 earthquake measuring 75 on the richter scale the 
interval between old faithful eruptions lengthened by more than 
five minutes a 1983 quake added seven minutes a number of 
moderate earthquakes have struck this year 
vandalism has turned off the steam at four geysers in the park 
people have thrown things into geysers that do not get blown out 
blocking the steam hutchinson said however people are prohibited 
from wandering off the boardwalks at old faithful which keeps them 
about 100 feet from the spout 
while the number of eruptions may be declining the volume of 
water spewing up and the height of the geyser have apparently not 
changed hutchinson said 
the geyser reaches about 130 feet and discharges between 3700 
and 8400 gallons of 204degree water each eruption

the communistaligned united peasant party 
today met with solidarity to consider its invitation to form a 
governing coalition that would exclude the communists 
with solidaritys 161 parliamentary seats and the peasant 
partys 76 a solidaritypeasant alliance would have a bare working 
majority of 237 votes in the 460member parliament 
if joined by the small democratic party which also has been 
linked to the communists the solidarityled coalition would have a 
firm majority 
the democrats said wedneday that they would like to discuss 
solidarity leader lech walesas invitation to join forces but no 
meeting has been scheduled 
the talks between the solidarity labor movement and the peasant 
party today were held in private at peasant party executive 
offices sen andrzej wielowieyski and sejm deputy jacek kuron 
deputy chairman of the solidarity caucus were among those 
representing solidarity 
they were joined by a handful of peasant party lawmakers 
including aleksander bentkowski the partys parliamentary leader 
were at the beginning of the beginning said jaroslaw 
kaczynski a solidarity senator from elblag who attended the 
hourlong meeting as walesas envoy he said the talks would 
continue 
earlier today bentkowski met with the new prime minister gen 
czeslaw kiszczak a government spokesman confirmed 
peasant party officials refused comment on the meeting 
according to the opposition newspaper gazeta wyborcza the 
meeting was for bentkowski to inform kiszczak that most of the 
peasant deputies in the sejm or parliament would oppose a cabinet 
nominated by kiszczak 
walesa said monday that any government formed by kiszczak would 
only extend the communists 45yearold monopoly on power the 
coalition he seeks would put the communists in the opposition in 
parliament 
the democrats and peasants have been linked to the communists 
since the late 1940s 
the democratic party said wednesday the wording of walesas 
proposal makes it difficult to take a final stand and that it 
wanted direct talks to clarify the offer 
the party said in a statement after a leadership meeting that it 
was ready to participate in any government of national confidence 
giving realistic hopes for overcoming the current stalemate and 
improvement of the economic situation 
solidaritys parliamentary floor leader bronislaw geremek said 
kiszczak is expected to present candidates to fill the cabinet by 
aug 24 until then we have time for dialogue he said 
bentkowski told state tv on wednesday that his caucus is 
susceptible to lech walesas proposition and generally speaking 
questions the appropriateness of its participation in the current 
coalition with the communists 
the peasant partys constituents reacted negatively to 
kiszczaks election aug 2 he said 
there are still two weeks before a final decision but on the 
basis of remarks presented so far one may conclude that the club 
will vote against the cabinet presented by gen kiszczak 
bentkowski said 
several deputies urged the party to reject a coalition with 
kiszczak on the ground that it would have no public support others 
appealed for a coalition with solidarity the people are 
revolting they wont hold for long said tadeusz sytek from 
ostrow wielkopolski western poland 
however sejm speaker mikolaj kozakiewicz a peasant party 
member told state tv that walesas offer seemed to be an 
extreme position and was illtimed because a prime minister was 
already chosen

a contra rebel spokesman says fear of revenge 
by sandinista supporters will keep most of the approximately 10000 
combatants from going back to their divided homeland in nicaragua 
they dont trust the sandinistas spokesman bosco matamoros 
said in an interview wednesday these people have seen farmers 
relatives neighbors destroyed killed by the state security 
the presidents of honduras nicaragua guatemala el salvador 
and costa rica reached an agreement monday that calls for disarming 
and disbanding the contras based in honduras by dec 5 
in return nicaragua promised to guarantee democracy and allow 
the contras to return home 
however matamoros said we are not going to lay down our arms 
after 10 years of promises based on lies 
most of the contras live in squalor at jungle camps inside 
honduras along the rugged mountains near the nicaraguan border 
most of the troops trekked into the safe havens last year after 
congress cut off military aid and barred the cia from resupplying 
the rebels by air inside nicaragua 
the united states has backed the rebels covertly or openly since 
1981 in their fight to depose the leftist sandinista government 
congress in march approved a 498 million nonlethal contra aid 
package that comes under review in november 
former assistant secretary of state elliot abrams a passionate 
contra supporter said wednesday that congressional democrats will 
try to use the review of the funds and the new central american 
agreement to try to starve the contras into going back to 
nicaragua where they face an uncertain future because of the 
countrys communist government 
sen terry sanford dnc a member of the senate foreign 
relations committee who has made several trips to nicaragua said 
resettlement of the rebels would have to be decided on a 
casebycase basis 
some certainly cant go home or they would see no future 
sanford said in a telephone interview some would fear political 
retribution and some would think it hard to make a living there 
he said the united states was obligated to relocate these 
peope but added our policy has to be somewhat flexible 
many of the rebels are illiterate peasants who know little other 
than the rural world of small farming 
thousands have suffered the loss of relatives homes to be 
free men matamoros said the idea is not to get a green card 
but you do have an obligation we are not a disposable good that 
the united states can disregard at will 
some 50000 people have been killed in the fighting most of 
them civilians in the rural northern mountains and central plains 
the years of battling have left deep scars in a nation where 
families often split their loyalties down the middle with brothers 
literally fighting brothers 
matamoros cited as an example the galeano family thirty members 
fled nicaragua to fight against the sandinistas who came to power 
in a 1979 revolutionary war that ousted the anastasio somoza 
dictatorship 
they were small farmers who had nothing to do with somoza 
matamoros said their land was expropriated they lost 
everything 
family member israel galeano who goes by the nom de guerre 
comandante franklin has been a contra troop commander for years 
he could not go home matamoros said i think that every 
night he would have to prepare for an ambush and there are 
hundreds such families 
in miami the immigration and naturalization service said 
wednesday that galeano was among nine contras who requested 
political asyslum in the united states but the miami herald quoted 
galeano as saying he sought travel documents rather than residence 
in the united states 
the rebel spokesman said the contras would face retaliatory 
murders and human rights abuses is they went back to nicaragua 
we are not guessing he said we have seen 10 years of 
sandinista rule

man and the skull was being examined to see whether it was that of 
ayako nomoto the 5yearold girl the man confessed to killing in 
early june police said 
a police official who spoke on condition of anonymity said it 
was too early to decide whether the man should be charged as 
ayakos killer or whether he would be linke to the case of the 
other three girls 
newspapers put out extra editions and television stations 
extended news programs to cover the case television crews went 
into the mans house to film his book and videotape collection and 
reporters interviewed his coworkers

survival without hardline rebel leader gulbaddin hekmatyar who 
serves as foreign minister

musicians have voted to take a 98 percent pay 
cut in a fouryear contract designed to keep the detroit symphony 
orchestra alive 
the agreement approved 828 with one abstention wednesday was 
reached monday said wesley jacobs of the detroit federation of 
musicians 
we want to do everything we can to be a part of the 
rejuvenation of the financial health of this orchestra said 
jacobs 
the musicians had one year left on their old contract but the 
orchestra sought a new one to reduce its debt projected at 117 
million this budget year under the new contract the base annual 
salary will drop to 47694 
the symphony missed a payroll last month and had threatened to 
close until the legislature appropriated 1 million in emergency 
aid received last week 
the musicians say the 75yearold orchestra considered one of 
the nations top 10 is an important asset for a city fighting a 
reputation for drugs and crime 
the orchestra has blamed its financial problems on low 
attendance caused by an inability to draw younger concertgoers and 
blacks who make up twothirds of the citys population of 1 
million 
several other us symphonies also run at a deficit including 
those in denver nashville new orleans and pittsburgh

a french geneticist testifying in a 
trial over the fate of seven fertilized human eggs said today that 
leaving the embryos in cold storage amounts to putting tiny human 
beings in concentration camps 
its not as hospitable a place as the secret temple of a 
womans womb dr jerome lejeune director of research at the 
french national center of scientific research testified in the 
unprecedented divorce case of junior lewis davis and mary sue davis 
the davises produced seven fertilized eggs in an in vitro 
fertilization clinic last year before their marriage broke up mrs 
davis wants to become pregnant with them while her husband does 
not want them used without his consent he said the embryos should 
be treated as jointly owned property 
a key distinction in the trial has been the characterization of 
the eggs 
lejeune who in 1959 discovered the genetic basis of downs 
syndrome testified as an expert witness for mrs davis that life 
begins at the moment of fertilization as soon as he has been 
conceived a man is a man he said 
lejeune said an early human being inside this suspended time 
cannot be the property of anybody 
by putting tiny human beings in a very cold space deprived of 
liberty deprived even of time they are suspended as it were in 
a concentration camp the geneticist said 
lejeune also said embryos have individual characteristics 
immediately upon conception 
the geneticist testified at a trial in silver spring md in 
1984 in which a husband was trying to prevent his wife from having 
an abortion he argued life begins at conception because that is 
when the genetic makeup is complete 
the embryos in the davis case have been fertilized for less than 
two days and have developed to between four and eight cells 
testimony at the trial indicated scientists do not consider 
fertilized eggs embryos until the cells begin taking on varying 
characteristics usually from 12 to 14 days after fertilization 
mrs davis testified tuesday she considers the embryos life i 
am the mother of these embryos she said they are the 
beginning of life they are more than just cells that mean 
nothing 
she said leaving the embryos in cold storage as her estranged 
husband proposes would be killing them 
davis testified that he does not consider the cells as life he 
said he opposes abortion but notes these embryos are not inside 
any womans body 
at the conclusion of tuesdays testimony mrs davis attorney 
said he was glad she had gotten to tell her side of the story 
i think were so accustomed in this country to women wishing 
to terminate fetuses that weve never ever considered a woman who 
would bare her soul to protect what shes created jay 
christenberry said i think emotionally america is calloused to 
this type of thought and i think the more we wake people up to it 
the more theyll understand that we need to be more serious about 
protecting the preborn 
blount county circuit court judge w dale young is expected to 
rule in the case within a month

a pregnant woman who police say stuffed 
a quarterounce of cocaine into her mouth and swallowed it as she 
was being arrested was charged with causing a risk of injury to a 
minor 
if nellie baez who is four months pregnant is convicted it 
would overturn connecticut case law that holds that a fetus is not 
a person a question central to the abortion debate authorities 
said 
but lawmakers civil libertarians and john j kelly the chief 
states attorney doubted the charge would hold up in court because 
of a 1986 state court ruling that a fetus is not a person 
baez 20 was arrested aug 1 and arraigned monday after being 
hospitalized she also was charged with cocaine possession and 
tampering with evidence 
police said the fetus appears to be fine 
kelly said of the riskofinjury charge i dont see that as 
fitting 
however kelly said the increasing incidence of cocaineaddicted 
newborns will force lawmakers to consider of whether the state 
should protect the fetus 
in rockford ill a grand jury in may refused to return 
manslaughter charges against a woman whose 2dayold daughter died 
allegedly from prenatal cocaine use in florida at least two women 
have been arrested under a drugdelivery law in the past year after 
giving birth to babies with cocaine in their systems 
martha stone legal director of the connecticut civil liberties 
union said her organization would fight attempts to bolster a 
fetus rights over a womans rights 
women have the constitutional right to privacy and the right 
to procreate by choice stone said if the criminal laws are 
being used to accord fetuses rights and in any way protect 
against harm to the fetus it interferes with the womans absolute 
right to privacy 
antiabortion activists applauded legal efforts to protect 
fetuses saying such cases will provide the push needed to overturn 
abortion laws 
i wish theyd consider every unborn baby at risk said mary 
ann pressamarita executive director of defenders of the unborn

reported deployment of the 10ton satellite about seven hours after 
columbia was launched from cape canaveral on tuesday we were 
extraordinarily pleased as were our colleagues in nasa that 
everything went so well 
asked about the satellites purpose rice replied im not at 
liberty to say 
the satellite according to sources close to the project is 
designed to snap highlydetailed photographs of military targets 
over a large area of the globe including most of the sovet union 
there were indications earlier but no confirmation that the 
satellite had been released on tuesday nasa at the direction of

president bush is expected to nominate former 
white house national security adviser gen colin l powell as 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff administration sources say 
powell at 52 would become the youngest man and the first 
black to become the nations top military officer 
the fourstar army general who now heads the forces command at 
fort mcpherson ga would take over the prestigious position from 
adm william j crowe jr who is due to retire sept 30 
a senior administration official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the white house was expected to make the 
announcement today 
in a statement anticipating the announcement sen sam nunn 
chairman of the senate armed service committee called powell an 
excellent nominee and said his panel would hold confirmation 
proceedings soon after congress returns from recess in september 
nunn dga said powells proven abilities and his 
experiences provide a sound foundation for his advice on 
wideranging defense issues in times of severe budget constraints 
and a rapidly changing international scene 
gen px kelley who worked with powell in the pentagon before 
retiring as commandant of the marine corps once described him as 
a very extraordinary guy 
he can handle stress extremely well he never gets rattled he 
was always a cool head kelley said 
in the post of chairman powell would act as the principal 
military adviser to the president and the secretary of defense 
during the most recent hostage crisis crowe was a frequent 
visitor to the white house offering his assessment of the military 
options available to bush 
under a new management reform program instituted by defense 
secretary dick cheney the chairman wields greater influence over 
the pentagons budget and is able to advise the secretary of 
defense on the full range of issues that come before him 
the chairman also is allowed to offer his own opinion to the 
president and defense secretary eschewing past practice of only 
passing on the opinion of the joint chiefs who are in charge of 
the various military branches 
the selection of powell would mean that the army general would 
leap over numerous more senior and more experienced military 
officers a leading candidate for the position has been air force 
gen robert herres the vice chairman of the joint chiefs 
powell distinguished himself in the highly visible white house 
roles of national security adviser and deputy national security 
adviser and was wellknown to bush during his tenure as vice 
president 
powell was the first black to be named chief of the nsc when 
president reagan tapped him for the post in november 1987 
he rose to the white house post after working with his 
predecessor frank carlucci to reform the scandalwracked office 
in the days after the irancontra affair 
pentagon officials expressed hope that powell will be warmly 
received in congress but his selection was expected by pentagon 
insiders to cause some ripples of discontent because he was named 
only recently to the fourstar level and lacks the broad experience 
of many senior military officers who have held the post in the past 
in speaking to groups of young blacks he often warns them of 
their duty to help others and to protect the gains of the civil 
rights revolution 
dont squander the blood sweat and tears of those who paved 
the way for you he told clark atlanta university graduates this 
spring the greatest danger is complacency 
in heading the forces command since april he was charged with 
keeping the 1 million army active reserve and national guard 
troops in the united states ready for combat in defense of the 
continental united states 
before his stint at the nsc powell commanded the army v corps 
in west germany for six months earlier he was defense secretary 
caspar weinbergers senior military assistant from 198386 
powell was born of jamaican immigrant parents in new york city 
and raised in the south bronx 
he was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1958 after earning a 
bachelors degree in geology at the city university of new york 
and later earned a masters degree in business administration from 
george washington university he served in the office of management 
and budget in 1972 during a term as a white house fellow 
powell served in vietnam in 1962 and again in 1968 and holds 
the bronze star for valor and a purple heart

the roman catholic church said today it 
has suspended plans to move nuns from a convent on the edge of 
auschwitz and it blamed a violent campaign being waged by some 
jewish groups pressing for the move 
in a statement carried by the official pap news agency cardinal 
franciszek macharski of krakow said conditions do not exist for 
carrying out a 1987 agreement to relocate the nuns to an 
international prayer center which has yet to be built 
while not stating specifically that the relocation has been 
permanently canceled macharskis statement made it appear the 
project is blocked for an indefinite period 
the world jewish congress which has led efforts to bring about 
the nuns removal called macharskis comments brutal and 
violent 
macharski blamed a series of protests by jewish groups at the 
convent of barefoot carmelite nuns demonstrations outside the 
convent constructed in a former theater just outside camp wall 
intensified this year after a february deadline for moving the nuns 
passed 
in one highly publicized incident july 14 seven american jews 
protesting the convent were evicted by workmen on the site 
macharski said the february deadline set for moving the nuns was 
unrealistic to begin with he said delays in the move caused 
on the side of some western jewish communities a violent campaign 
of accusations and slanders 
such attitudes and actions impede further realization of the 
construction of the center in this atmosphere of aggressive 
demands there is no way of caring together for the construction 
of a site of mutual respect 
at the foundation of an act of peace there must be the wish 
for the peace he said 
the world jewish congress said in washington that macharskis 
remarks constitute a tragic blow to those of us in the jewish and 
catholic world who have worked so long to foster mutual 
understanding and respect 
work still has not begun on the international prayer center 
although church officials said they were in the process of buying 
land for it 
jewish groups have said the convent and the placement of 
religious symbols at auschwitz including a 23foothigh cross is 
deeply offensive to them an estimated 25 million jews were killed 
at the camp during hitlers drive to annihilate jews 
poles who are overwhelmingly roman catholic argue that tens of 
thousands of polish catholics including nuns and priests died at 
the camp and that the nuns should be allowed to pray for them at 
the convent 
local residents have opposed moving the nuns

cases under trial against people arrested before the military 
takeover sept 18 were to be dropped and those serving sentences of 
under two years were to be immediately released the order said 
the amnesty does not apply to cases of treason or breaches of 
martial law which was imposed during the takeover to prevent open

a northwest airlines dc10 carrying 256 people 
made an emergency landing in denver after its tail engine 
apparently began breaking up officials said they found 
shrapnellike holes in the engine cover 
the incident resembled the engine failure that preceded last 
months crash of a united airlines dc10 in sioux city iowa in 
which 111 people died 
flight 308 from los angeles to minneapolis landed safely at 
stapleton international airport about 630 pm wednesday said 
airport spokesman richrad boulware there was no apparent damage to 
its hydraulic controls unlike the iowa jet 
less than 30 minutes earlier while cruising at 39000 feet the 
crew reported a loss of oil pressure and severe vibration in the 
tail engine and shut it down said greg feith spokesman for the 
national transportation safety board 
a 13member ntsb investigative team from washington was sent to 
denver 
accidents that do not involve fatalities or serious damage to 
aircraft normally are investigated by regional offices but the 
northwest failure was too much of a coincidence feith said 
referring to the sioux city crash 
in washington however federal aviation administration chief 
james b busey said officials know of no hard facts that would 
lead us to take action to ground dc10s 
busey said he did not have enough information to compare the 
incident with the crash in sioux city but he said the dc10 is 
safe to fly i would fly in the aircraft today he called it a 
comfortable goodperforming airliner 
a governmentindustry task force looking into possible design 
changes in the dc10 and other widebody airliners was holding its 
first meeting today busey said the faa formed the group after the 
iowa crash and said it was also in response to incidents several 
years ago involving a boeing 747 and a lockheed l1011 in which 
engine failures caused damage to aircraft control mechanisms 
at least 18 or about 4 percent of the 445 dc10s built have 
been involved in accidents faa figures show that is a higher 
percentage than for boeing 747s or lockheed l1011 jumbos 
busey said the northwest incident was an example of the way 
the system should work because the pilots quickly shut down the 
engine diverted to a nearby airport and landed safely with no 
injuries 
we heard a loud noise said passenger don burnett it was 
a boom and a shudder we couldnt see it we just felt it he 
said someone said something was hanging from the engines 
they experienced a severe vibration from the no 2 engine 
and as a precautionary measure they elected to make an 
unscheduled landing said kevin whalen a spokesman for the st 
paul minnbased airline 
the no 2 engine is mounted in the aircrafts vertical 
stabilizer just above the tail wing on uniteds flight 232 the 
no 2 engine disintegrated shooting shrapnel that apparently 
severed hydraulic lines used to control the jet the investigation 
into the cause of that crash is continuing 
boulware said there were multiple shrapnellike holes in the 
outer cowling or cover of the no 2 engine 
one of the holes was big enough i could have stuck my hand 
through he said 
boulware said he also saw broken turbine fan blades inside the 
engine and that the engines tail cone was missing 
but he added we cant draw any comparisons to the sioux city 
flight we dont know exactly what happened 
northwest spokesman bob gibbons said there were two small holes 
in the engines cowling he said northwest dc10s are equipped with 
pratt and whitney engines unlike the united jet which used 
general electric engines 
the dc10 has one engine under each wing in addition to the tail 
engine 
the dc1040 model plane was one of 22 purchased by northwest 
gibbons said it was built in 1972 airline officials said they 
said they had no immediate information on the performance history 
of the plane or the no 2 engine 
whalen said the landing was normal in terms of controlling the 
airplane the 245 passengers were being placed on alternate flights 
to minneapolis he said there also were 11 crew members on board 
he added 
passenger john ophoven a minneapolis businessman returning home 
with his family from a vacation at disneyland said the plane 
just shook a lot 
the pilot said the hydraulics were fine and they had all the 
steering said ophoven the vibration lasted a minute or two 
we dropped fast for a little while it never really tipped it 
slowed down then it smoothed out

we worked for the better to come 
said arnold small we knew it was a good thing we were doing 
what small and tens of thousands of others were doing in the 
early years of the century was digging the panama canal the 
waterway that joined the atlantic and pacific oceans 75 years ago 
on aug 15 
small was 24 in 1914 when the first ship sailed through 
i helped build the canal that is a wonderful thing to 
remember small said in an interview as he watched an honor guard 
place a wreath on a monument to the thousands of workers who died 
during a failed french attempt to build a canal in the 19th century 
small sat in a wheelchair on the side of a small hill in the 
steamy heat of the green lush woods on the banks of the canal near 
the pedro miguel locks 
small was born in barbados and like thousands of fellow 
islanders came to panama to find work he later fought with the 
british army in europe during world war i before returning to 
panama 
only small and a few companions survived those days of malaria 
yellow fever picks and shovels sweat blood dynamite and wages 
of 10 cents an hour 
men came by the thousands from barbados jamaica ireland the 
basque area of spain greece barbados and many other lands to 
work under american bosses and engineers 
they dug the canal damming a river to create a huge lake and 
building the system of locks that raises ships in 1000foot 
waterbeds 85 feet above sea level and lowers them 50 miles away 
there were only a little more than 300 panamanians actually 
digging 
even then we had started our serviceoriented economy canal 
deputy administrator fernando manfredo said smiling we had 
thousands of panamanians providing food lodging water and other 
services to those who actually dug the canal 
thousands died in accidents in the days when health insurance 
was unknown and liquor was the medicine that made pain go away 
in those days all of us had to drink quinine almost every day 
while working said constantine parky parkinson 
when the rainy season came it fell for weeks sometimes for 
months ones working clothes had to be worn every day for days wet 
because there was no sun to dry them one had to wash his own 
clothes and keep the camp clean said parkinson 94 who came 
from jamaica 
on the fourth of july we got a free train to take us to panama 
for the celebration he said there was plenty of free food and 
cool drinks 
i remember my grandmother talking about how when halleys 
comet was passing by in 1910 everybody was saying that all were 
going to be killed so a bunch of spanish workers decided to get 
drunk out of their minds and die that way all they got was a 
hangover manfredo said 
we made panama a gateway to the world small said my 
brother walter brought me here and i started as a water boy in 
1911 i am a lucky man others younger than me are in worse shape 
i thank god i am alive 
parkinson lost a leg during construction until recently he had 
been campaigning for more benefits for nonus citizens who worked 
on the canal 
it was a labor force that had pride in what it did it is a 
tradition that our workers still hold manfredo said during 
the worst time of the political disturbances here last year 
absenteeism of canal workers was at its lwoedt

the population of jewish settlements in the 
occupied territories is 6500 higher than last year despite the 
20monthold palestinian uprising the government said 
the figures released wednesday by the governmentrun central 
bureau of statistics show that jewish settlements grew almost 400 
percent more than jerusalem the secondfastest growing area 
the growth rate has however slipped since the uprising against 
israeli rule of the occupied west bank and gaza strip began 20 
months ago 
settler leaders attributed the continued growth to rightwing 
activists moving to the occupied lands in a show of jewish resolve 
to hold onto the disputed lands 
noam arnon a spokesman for the gush emunim settler movement 
said settlers who move to the territories want to give a positive 
answer to the uprising 
leftwing legislators expressed skepticism about the government 
figures critics said some jewish nationalists bought homes in the 
territories to boost population figures but did not move to the 
area 
dedi zucker a legislator from the leftist citizens rights 
movement also said the figures do not reflect those who leave the 
settlements but do not legally change their addresses 
independent observers said the settler population may be higher 
than the government figures most also said both leftists and 
rightists have tried to skew the figures 
the bureau of statistics reported that 66500 jews lived in the 
occupied territories in late 1988 an increase of 103 percent over 
1987 
according to the bureau 2500 of the new residents were 
accounted for by the number of births over deaths while 4000 
people moved to the area 
in 1986 the year before the outbreak of the palestinian 
uprising the settler population increased by 158 percent the 
bureau said 
many observers attribute the slower growth to the uprising 
which has seen constant stoning and firebombing attacks on 
settlerowned cars 
at least 531 palestinians and 38 israelis have been killed in 
the revolt which began in december 1987 
the bureau did not survey the palestinian population but past 
figures show 1 million arabs in the west bank and 700000 in the 
gaza strip 
at least 80 percent of the settlers are commuters who take 
advantage of governmentsubsidized housing in settlements near 
israel observers said 
arnon said that among many committed jews the uprising actually 
provided an incentive to move into the territories 
many people who were unsure of whether to move into a 
settlement or not did so last year because of the security 
problems he said whoever thinks the nation of israel is 
moving out of here had better wake up 
the united states considers the more than 130 jewish settlements 
in the occupied territories an obstacle to peace us policy calls 
on israel to give up occupied land seized from jordan and egypt in 
the 1967 middle east war in exchange for peace 
meron benvenisti of the independent west bank data base project 
said his figures showed the settler population was closer to 74000 
at the end of last year up from 67000 in 1987 
benvenisti said his figures are higher because the government 
does not take into account israelis who move to settlements without 
legally changing their addresses so their children can attend 
better schools in israel 
he said the growth was abetted by new roads built by the army 
that made commuting faster and avoided arab towns

a trump shuttle jet carrying 56 people skidded to 
a halt with a spray of sparks and smoke today in an emergency 
landing at logan airport after its nose wheel failed to extend no 
injuries were reported 
fire equipment circled the plane and sprayed it with foam after 
the boeing 727 from new yorks laguardia airport ground to a halt 
passengers slid down emergency chutes and walked to a waiting bus 
for a ride to the terminal 
when they first said they had problems everybody was just 
kind of joking about it said a passenger charlie cormay of 
sudbury once we realized there was going to be a crash landing 
everybody got pretty solemn 
as the plane came in for a landing cormay said a few 
prayers went through his mind i looked out the window and saw 
all the emergency vehicles thats when i realized it was actually 
pretty serious 
before the landing the plane circled nearly an hour dumping 
fuel the pilot also tried to shake the wheel loose from its 
housing by dropping the plane onto a runway but the attempt failed 
and the jet took to the air again 
they made one sweep but it didnt shake loose said greg 
sullivan 19 who watched the attempt 
the plane circled several more times before smoothly dropping 
its wing wheels to the runway in a gentle but ungainly landing 
its nose scraping the pavement 
passengers were told to put their heads in their laps as the jet 
came in 
they prepared us very well by the time we landed we were all 
very happy and relieved said kathy hussey of new york city 
suddenly you were on the runway with foam on your face and on 
your back 
you prepare yourself for the worst said another passenger 
glenn porter of new york but it was really just like a rough 
regular landing 
the jet carried 49 passengers and seven crew members said dee 
clark a spokeswoman for the massachusetts port authority which 
operates logan 
developer donald trump inaugurated the trump shuttle service 
june 8 after buying planes and landing rights from eastern airlines 
for 365 million the shuttle operates between new york boston and 
washington 
it was the second emergency landing in a little over a week in 
the united states involving a landing gear problem 
on aug 2 a piedmont airlines boeing 737 with 100 people aboard 
scraped its wing and engine at greensboro nc after its left 
main gear jammed no one was injured

rescue crews searching for a plane 
that disappeared with us rep mickey leland and 13 other people 
on board were told today that a weather satellite detected an 
emergency signal from an airplane 
james haley a spokesman at the us embassy said the faint 
locater signal was picked up by a national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration orbiter and was coming from an area 130 miles 
southsoutheast of addis ababa the capital 
haley said the region is well outside the area rescue workers 
have been searching since monday when the twinengine plane 
carrying the texas democrat and his party disappeared in remote 
rugged country near the sudanese border 
at the pentagon spokesman pete williams said a u2 
reconnaisance plane allowed to fly over the area wednesday had 
taken pictures of the region but that the photographs had not been 
developed 
he also called the report of the signal very preliminary 
haley said it would probably be several hours before anyone 
reached the site of the signal because it was dark and the signal 
came from rough terrain 
were talking about 20 miles in rough country he said in a 
telephone interview adding that the road conditions in the area 
were not known 
officials in goba 200 miles southeast of the capital were 
instructed to dispatch searchers to the site immediately haley 
said 
most commercial aircraft carry radio transponders that send out 
a signal allowing the plane to be located in the event of an 
accident 
those signals and similar ones broadcast by ships are tracked 
by weather satellites in a searchandrescue system operated by the 
united states the soviet union france and canada 
james t bailey of the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration said in washington today we got one signal on one 
satellite pass wednesday night there is no way to be sure it is 
coming from that aircraft 
bailey said subsequent satellite passes have not been able to 
confirm the signal because of radio interference 
while satellite officials cannot be sure the signal they 
received was from lelands plane we are treating is as if it 
is he said 
leland chairman of the house select committee on hunger set 
out monday morning aboard a twin otter aircraft to visit the 
fugnido refugee camp 480 miles southwest of the capital 
also aboard were three members of lelands staff a friend four 
americans from the us embassy and the us agency for 
international development and five ethiopians including three 
government officials the pilot and copilot 
weather along their route was bad with heavy clouds and low 
visibility 
reports of a light plane circling two dirt landing strips in the 
remote mountainous highlands of southwestern ethiopia reached the 
capital shortly after lelends plane was reported missing monday 
evening 
john guerra an embassy official in addis ababa said this gave 
searchers hope but added we have to reiterate that these areas 
are so islated they could have put down anyplace 
he described the region as without any communication 
virtually no roads and sparsely populated 
the search area was expanded wednesday to include parts of sudan 
south of fugnido and covered more than 24000 square miles 
two us air force c130 hercules cargo planes arrived today 
from west germany and immediately joined the search 
guerra acknowledged the possibility that lelands plane could 
have slammed into one of the many mountains along its path some of 
which are higher than 12000 feet 
but the only reports weve had is of planes circling fields 
guerra said suggesting the plane got past the most rugged terrain 
and into an area where an emergency landing would have been easier 
robert houdek us charge daffairs in addis ababa said there 
still was cause for optimism because lelands plane was a great 
bush aircraft capable of landing in close rough terrain 
he said the pilot assefa gebregiorgis was the best damn 
bush pilot in ethiopia and knows his country like the back of 
his hand 
fugnido is one of four refugee camps in southwestern ethiopia 
run by the un high commissioner for refugees it houses more than 
300000 sudanese who have fled famine and civil war in their 
country

cocacola co officials dont want people buying 
little bottles of mad scientist magic powder because it might 
just make them think theres coke in their coke 
the magic powder is a powdered bubble gum produced in italy 
and distributed in this country by almaleo usa inc of 
northbrook a chicago suburb the company sells it in tiny plastic 
bottles that cocacola officials say are shaped like their old soda 
bottles 
the soft drink giant sued almaleo and briefs in the case were 
heard wednesday by us district court judge james moran 
cocacola maintains that the bubble gums packaging may create a 
connection between their product and cocaine 
think about it magic powder being sold in a coke bottle 
whats the implication asked randy donaldson manager for public 
relations for cocacola 
while an extract of the coca leaf is used as a flavoring in 
cocacola donaldson said cocaine itself is not and never has 
been an ingredient in the soft drink 
floyd a mandell attorney for almaleo said he thinks 
cocacola is overreacting 
it doesnt even look like cocaine it looks like powdered 
candy mandell said theres yellowishwhite powder in the 
little yellow bottles and pink powder in the little pink bottles 
you chew it and it turns into bubble gum and changes color 
mandell said almaleo is a small privately held company which 
sells novelty candy products manufactured by other concerns 
the lawsuit accuses almaleo of trademark infringement unfair 
competition and consumer fraud donaldson said the company wants 
moran to issue a ceaseanddesist order on sales of the plastic 
bottles and is seeking monetary relief in an amount to be set by 
the court 
sales of the bubble gum have been suspended while the judge 
considers the briefs 
donaldson said the magic powder bottles appear to be 
miniature versions of cocacolas old 6ounce bottles the shape 
of those bottles is trademarked he said 
mandell however calls them nondescript contour bottles and 
says there is no direct resemblance to cocacolas 
its ridiculous to think almaleo wouldnt arrange a copyright 
or a trademark agreement if they thought one was needed he said 
they did for the ghost buster candy they sell 
mandell said almaleo also sells creepy crawlies skull crushers 
and the gummy worm type of candy 
he said the company offered to stop selling the bottles once the 
current threemonth supply runs out but cocacola wasnt 
satisfied and demanded that no more of them be sold 
youre talking about several hundred thousand dollars in 
merchandise mandell said not being able to sell it could be a 
crippling blow to a company this size

erosion in their political power 
racial tensions have been rising over charges of police 
brutality unfair housing practices and unequal representation 
minorities comprise more than half of dallas population but there 
are only two nonwhites on the 11member council 
hoping to ease those tensions city leaders have offered a 
proposed charter change to add two singledistrict seats plus four 
others representing city quadrants to give minorities a louder 
voice in local government 
the plan provides tremendous opportunities for the racial and 
language minorities said ray hutchison a white attorney who 
heads the dallas citizens charter review committee 
minority opinion is split but many hispanics and most black 
activists say the proposed plan would dilute not bolster their 
political clout they also accuse the city of rushing the issue to 
the ballot in hopes of circumventing a courtordered election plan 
it was to settle a lawsuit that the city scrapped its 
allatlarge council in 1975 for the current one comprised of eight 
singledistrict members and three atlarge including the mayor 
blacks roughly 30 percent of the citys 985000 residents 
continually have elected black council members from the citys two 
largely black districts but hispanics who make up more than 18 
percent of the city have elected only one hispanic from a 
singlemember district and one atlarge member neither currently 
on the council the asian and american indian population about 5 
percent of the city has no ethnic representative on the council 
the 1041 proposal on the ballot would add two single 
districts and four quadrant representatives leaving the mayor the 
only atlarge member 
hutchison believes most minorities support the charter change 
it defies me why the media listens to the vocal opposition to 
a 1041 plan that gives minorities the greatest opportunity to 
achieve racial equality he said 
the charter review committee grew out of an interracial group 
dallas together appointed by mayor annette strauss last year to 
help ease racial tensions 
friction was growing over confrontations between minorities and 
police dallas officers had their deadliest year on record with 
five officers slain and several blacks and hispanics some merely 
bystanders to crime were shot by police a congressional inquiry 
found no misuse of deadly force but recommended police hire more 
minorities and study alternatives to force the inquiry did little 
to calm minority fears 
since then protesters have marched the streets dumped tea in 
the city hall pond come chained and gagged to council meetings 
locked arms and sung we shall overcome to council members 
and chased the mayor from the chambers 
ive never seen our community more unified on any subject 
before said pete johnson executive director of the dallas 
chapter of the southern christian leadership council a civil 
rights group not any black organization not even the black 
chamber of commerce has come out in support of this plan 
johnson who is black doesnt believe minorities would gain any 
representation under the 1041 plan and adding council seats that 
minorities might not win could dilute instead of strengthen their 
political power he said 
with two seats out of 10 excluding the mayor blacks now make 
up a fifth of the council theyd lose voting strength if they had 
only two sure seats out of 14 under the 1041 plan he said 
percentage wise its crazy ive always thought its because 
they think we cant add 
some hispanics believe they stand to gain under the proposed 
charter change 
right now we dont have a chicano on the council i think this 
plan will give us the chance to have probably two said rene 
martinez a minority business activist who leads the prochange 
vote yes for dallas campaign 
the 1041 plan is backed by the dallas hispanic chamber of 
commerce 
but other hispanics side with the black opponents 
diana orozco cochair of dallas citizens for democracy said 
she believes city leaders thought the ballot issue would help them 
answer a federal lawsuit challenging the citys voting system 
the lawsuit filed last year by two black activists is 
scheduled to be heard in september ms orozcos group believes the 
city needs at least 12 singlemember districts to give minorities 
fair representation 
i think that they city leaders felt that by placing the 
1041 plan on the ballot that the federal judge would delay the 
matter but that did not happen ms orozco said i think were 
just dividing the city on this issue and wasting money when it is 
in the federal courts

for the first time in west points 
187year history the captain of the corps of cadets is a woman 
kristin baker a selfproclaimed army brat from burke va 
confidently marched onto the us military academy grounds 
wednesday afternoon after leading a regiment of new cadets on a 
13mile march from lake frederick where theyd trained for six 
days 
the 5foot4 112pound baker who received the academys 
highest cadet honor on the basis of academic excellence athletic 
ability and military prowess told the panting plebes to get some 
chow and then waded into a horde of reporters and photographers 
now my first objective is ring weekend then the first 
football game then graduation on the 31st of may beyond that i 
really dont know she said 
commanding a brigade of more than 4400 cadets will be bakers 
primary concern for the coming academic year which starts today 
women admitted as cadets since 1976 make up 10 percent of the 
cadets at west point 
the first captaincy at west point was one of the last hurdles 
if you will that women had to cross before they were fully 
accepted as members of the officer corps of the army said col 
james hawthorne director of academy relations 
one of bakers fellow cadets said her appointment might open 
more doors in the army for women 
if she does well then i think theyll be more likely to chose 
a female for higher positions said junior lisa buskirk 
baker 21 is majoring in human factors psychology the study 
of the interaction between man and machines she said she has not 
decided what she wants to do once commissioned as a second 
lieutenant in the us army 
this is just a small part of what im going to do in the 
future baker said as far as what im going to do whether or 
not im going to make it a career is still to be seen 
the daughter of an army colonel whos also a us military 
academy graduate baker said she never felt pressured by her father 
to follow in his footsteps 
he supported me no matter where i went baker said i had 
teachers who pushed harder than my father did

ussoviet negotiations on chemical weapons will 
resume next week an american diplomat said thursday 
a soviet official said new agreements could be reached in the 
10day round but the us assessment was more cautious 
the talks are aimed at setting joint inspections of each sides 
chemical arms sites and settling disputes over how to monitor 
stockpiles 
the superpowers say such moves will help speed the geneva talks 
on a global ban of the weapons where verification long has been a 
point of disagreement 
ussoviet talks were expected to resume in the fall now the 
new round precedes next months meeting between secretary of state 
james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
in the united states 
in the round the soviet delegation intends to complete the 
development of an agreement on those areas where positions of the 
ussr and usa are close moscows chief envoy sergei 
batsanov told the 40nation conference on disarmament 
the conference has been debating a worldwide ban on the 
production stockpiling and use of chemical weapons for 21 years 
us envoy max friedersdorf said negotiators will make every 
effort to build the last rounds progress and finish draft 
agreements in the new session set for aug 1524 
but he said some big divergences remain and refused to 
predict whether work could be completed 
after the last round both sides reported agreement on 
principles governing onthespot inspections they said more work 
was needed on other issues including an exchange of stockpile data 
and the timing of inspections 
moscow removed a main obstacle last month by accepting the us 
position that inspections begin even while a global chemical arms 
ban is being drafted 
geneva negotiators will seek to work out a detailed accord on 
this point friedersdorf said in an interview 
he said the soviet shift was an important step but as far 
as getting a worldwide ban it doesnt move the process forward as 
much as we would like 
in the overall picture weve still got a long way to go he 
said 
batsanov said early inspections would be a very serious 
confidencebuilding measure and foster openness and 
transparency in the military field 
the united states and soviet union have the worlds biggest 
chemical arsenals 
through inspections of soviet sites us officials say they 
want to verify moscows claims it has no more than 50000 tons of 
chemical armaments some western analysts have said the actual 
stockpile is more than six times bigger 
neither side has given firm indications when data exchanges or 
inspections could begin

the soviet union on thursday said austria 
could lose its political neutrality as a result of its application 
for membership in the european economic community 
chancellor franz vranitzky noted however that austrias desire 
to join the eec was purely an internal affair 
foreign minister alois mock sent a letter to the eec in july to 
apply for membership insisting on safeguarding its 
internationally recognized status of permanent neutrality to 
maintain peace and security in europe 
in a memo delivered to vranitzky on thursday by moscows 
ambassador to vienna gennady shikin the kremlin said austrian 
membership in the eec would not be exclusively economic 
it could thus lead to the loss of the actual possibility for 
austria to realize its neutral policy according to the note 
whose text was provided by the austria press agency 
following from this the soviet leadership has received with 
concern the news of austrias intent to take up negotiations on 
joining the european community the memo said 
the memorandum also noted however the statements by austrian 
leaders that it will consider membership only if its neutrality is 
not jeapordized 
it said the soviet union hoped neutrality would remain a 
priority noting that austrias neutrality represents a great 
factor of stability of trust and of mutual understanding in all of 
europe 
vranitzky said the memo showed that austria was on the right 
eec course of pushing its own interests while being aware of 
the position of our friends 
austrias parliament voted the countrys neutrality into law in 
1955 after the conclusion of the state treaty and the withdrawal of 
the occupying forces of the soviet union the united states france 
and britain 
under the terms of its neutrality austria pledged not to join 
any military alliance or allow the stationing of any foreign troops 
on its territory 
with the exception of ireland which claims neutrality all of 
the other 12 eec member countries are also members of the nato 
alliance

rescue workers today searched the 
muddy banks of the san rafael river for more victims of a train 
crash that killed at least 99 people and scattered rail cars across 
the track and into the ravine below 
the train plunged off a bridge and fell about 25 feet into the 
river early wednesday while en route from the coastal resort of 
mazatlan to the northern city of mexicali on the border with 
calexico calif 
passenger cars were jumbled along the tracks like straws some 
lay on their side in the river 
heavy rains wednesday hampered efforts to reach victims and the 
search was suspended dring the night but the sky cleared this 
morning and police firefighters and red cross workers returned to 
the site 
helicopters landed rescue workers nearby and casualties were 
taken out on railroad handcars 
officials said at least 107 people were injured including 30 
seriously and that the death toll was expected to rise 
torrential rains over the last week were blamed for the crash 
the cause was quite clear the heavy rains loosened the 
railbed and the rails just gave way said roberto martinez 
maestre a spokesman for the state government based in mexico city 
730 miles from the crash site 
about 360 people were riding the 11car train popularly known 
as the burro because it stops at almost every station along the 
900mile route 
rail and rescue officials could provide no immediate breakdown 
on the nationalities of victims a spokesman at the us consulate 
in mazatlan said no americans had so far been reported among the 
dead eleven victims identified wednesday night were all mexicans 
three americans were among the survivors the two men and a 
woman walked away from the wreck without serious injuries and were 
put on a bus to mexicali today said francisco mejia a state 
transportation official in los mochis mejia did not have the 
identities of the americans but said they were on their way to san 
diego 
the train was patronized almost entirely by poor mexicans 
it left mazatlan at 740 pm tuesday and had gone about 250 
miles when the accident occurred at about 4 am police said they 
did not know how fast the train was going at the time of the 
accident 
most people on the train were apparently asleep and the 
majority of the victims drowned said javier lopez the red cross 
duty officer in los mochis 60 miles northeast of the crash scene 
in mexico city president carlos salinas de gortari expressed 
his condolences to relatives and said in a statement he had ordered 
national railways which includes the pacfic route to pay 
compensation and burial costs 
survivors were being put up in local hotels and would be given 
money for travel and new clothes according to luis humberto 
peimbert director of social services in the nearby town of guasave 
sinaloa state gov francisco labastida ochoa rushed to the scene 
wednesday then went to nearby guamuchil for the night the bodies 
and the injured were being brought to guamuchil and guasave 
lt gabriela herrera a duty officer with the guasave police

the rest at guamuchil and los mochis 60 miles away 
janet gaxiole sandoval a secretary at a social security clinic 
in guasave said at least 30 of the injured were in serious 
condition 
accidents happen every couple of months on the rundown mexican 
railway system but this was by far the most serious train accident 
this year in mexico 
at least 34 passengers were killed injured when an express train 
derailed in july 1982 near tepic capital of nayarit state south of 
sinaloa 
another 62 passengers died and 99 were injured in feburary 1983

27 takers when it asked 2800 incoming freshmen if theyd like to 
live in a dormitory where overnight visits by the opposite sex are 
banned 
but university officials are moving ahead with a policy that 
restricts oppositesex visitation in all oncampus housing by 1992 
when classes start aug 28 two dorms set aside for the ban this 
year will be filled by the 27 freshmen who requested spaces plus 
453 who did not either because they oppose it or are unaware of 
the policy adopted four months ago by uscs trustees 
we had to make a tough decision and place people in those 
buildings even though they hadnt requested it said richard 
wertz usc vice president for business affairs 
usc provides housing for about 6500 single students 
eight women and 19 men said they wanted to live in a hall 
banning overnight visits by the opposite sex 
the school adopted the rules after state rep mike fair a usc

escaped with 17 automatic guns military officials said 
elsewhere 16 more people were killed in tamil and sinhalese 
ethnic violence since wednesday said the officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
they said 25 radicals from the peoples liberation front took 
part in the dawn attack on the police station in bentota a popular 
resort 45 miles south of colombo 
the militants arrived in two vans threw grenades opened fire 
on guards and fled with the weapons the officials said 
on wednesday members of the front shot and killed a sinhalese 
soldiers mother and three sisters in the southern kalutara 
district the officials said also in kalutara three civilians 
were killed by the radicals they said 
in the northcentral town of polonnaruwa soldiers shot to death 
a radical fleeing a search operation the officials said three 
civilians were killed in the last 24 hours in that town they said 
the government blames the leftwing radicals for 4000 killings 
since they launched an antigovernment campaign two years ago to 
protest the indian peacekeeping soldiers in the northeast indian 
soldiers were deployed under an indiansri lankan peace accord to 
disarm tamil militants who had agreed to end an insurgency for an 
independent nation 
while all rebel groups surrendered arms the dominant liberation

and began attacking indian soldiers at least 1000 indian soldiers 
have died in ongoing fighting about 10000 sri lankans have died 
in the sixyear separatist war 
indian soldiers shot and killed five tamil tigers on wednesday

will order the troops home only when security for the tamils in the 
northeast is assured

agreed a peace committee should oversee security for all 
communities in the north and east the proposed committee would 
include representatives of all former tamil rebel groups and would 
be headed by a government minister he said 
the other terms for a withdrawal that were worked out during the 
new delhi talks were being studied by the government and the 
opposition parties he said 
if the government accepts the package then the ceasefire 
between indian soldiers and tamil tigers and the induction of the 
tamil tigers into the peace committee can be worked out he said 
tamils who form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
demand a separate nation citing discrimination by the majority 
sinhalese in jobs and education sinhalese make up 75 percent of 
the population and control the government and the military 
india became involved in the ethnic problems of its southeastern 
neighbor because of the sympathies of its own 60 million tamils for

fernandez the spy agencys former station chief in costa rica 
is the highest ranking cia officer ever indicted associate 
independent counsel laurence shtasel said in a ninepage brief 
the first amendment interest in judicial openness is 
particularly apparent in the circumstances of this unusual 
appeal said the papers filed with the appeals court 
parts of the government are pitted against each other over the 
ultimate issue of who will control this prosecution the 
prosecutors noted 
also involved in the legal battle said the prosecution is the 
independent counsels ability to prosecute government officials 
including those in the cia in a manner unrestrained by the 
department of justice 
us district court judge claude hilton in alexandria va 
decided last month that fernandez is entitled to disclose as part 
of his defense the locations of cia stations in el salvador and 
honduras and a third cia facility in a latin american country 
the judge also said fernandez may disclose details of secret cia 
programs in costa rica which prosecutors said were initiated at the 
request of that countrys government 
the projects are a sophisticated communications station 
assistance to costa ricas defense forces and a program dealing 
with nicaraguan nationals in costa rica to enhance that countrys 
preparation for possible aggressive action by nicaragua 
the justice department acting on behalf of the cia objected to 
making detailed disclosure about the stations and programs and 
announced it would appeal hiltons rulings 
walshs office says the departments only course of action is to 
file an affidavit prohibiting disclosure of the information on 
national security grounds that could lead to dismissal of some or 
all of the criminal charges against fernandez 
walshs office could then file its own appeal with the appeals 
court 
the justice department is reluctant to take the drastic step of 
filing a potentially casekilling affidavit

the state department said thursday a palestine 
liberation organization statement raises questions about the 
groups commitment to accommodation understanding and peace 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler commented in response to a 
question about the statement by the fatah the main group of the 
plo at a meeting in tunisia 
delegates to the fifth congress of the fatah approved a 
resolution calling for intensification of the armed struggle and 
all other forms of battle to put an end to the israeli occupation 
of palestinian territories 
the fatah resolution distributed by the palestinian news agency 
wafa did not say what kind of military operations might be 
conducted outside the occupied lands or define all other forms of 
battle 
hardliners had pressed the congress to recommend extending the 
armed struggle beyond the west bank and gaza plo leader yasser 
arafats declaration that military action would be confined to the 
occupied territories had helped persuade the bush administration to 
open a dialogue with the plo 
at the state department ms tutwiler said the political 
program raises questions about fatahs commitment to 
accommodation understanding and peace this statements derogatory 
rhetoric on israel its tone of confrontation and violence and its 
preference for unrealistic principles and solutions instead of 
practical ideas for peace are unhelpful 
under israeli prime minister yitzhak shamirs election plan for 
the area palestinian delegates would be chosen to negotiate with 
israel 
fatah said elections must be held in a democratic atmosphere 
under international supervision after the withdrawal of israeli 
forces as part of a global plan for a definitive solution to 
the israeliarab conflict

the ruling communist party expelled chinas 
leading computer entrepreneur from its ranks thursday for having 
supported the spring prodemocracy protests 
police meanwhile said they had arrested another student leader 
leading party theorists gathered to praise senior leader deng 
xiaopings contributions to party theory in yet another sign of the 
growing official reverence being given the 84yearold leader since 
he ordered the june crackdown on the studentled protests 
officials also reported the executions of 18 convicted thieves 
or robbers but said the crimes were not connected with the 
protests 
xinhua said wan runnan whose computer company the stone group 
co was nicknamed the ibm of china was expelled from the party 
and fired as stone chairman and president he fled china after the 
crackdown 
wan 43 founded stone in 1984 and built it into chinas leading 
computer manufacturer and a model of westernstyle management 
techniques he epitomized the precrackdown reform dream of private 
entrepreneurs turning ideas and knowhow into cash 
xinhua said wan plotted fanned and directly joined in the 
recent counterrevolutionary rebellion after the government 
imposed martial law in beijing on may 20 to quell the protests 
stones research institute collected signatures from members of the 
national legislature calling for an emergency session to discuss 
ending martial law 
wan was the most prominent businessman involved in the democracy 
movement but many small private tradesmen supported it quietly by 
donating food drinks and other supplies to the student protesters 
two other dissidents academics yan jiaqi and bao zunxin were 
expelled from the party wednesday and dismissed from their research 
posts yan also has fled china where there is a warrant for his 
arrest bao is believed to be in jail 
police in the southeastern city of guangzhou confirmed they had 
arrested zheng xuguang of the beijing space and aeronautics 
university bringing to seven the number of student leaders 
confirmed in custody from a national mostwanted list of 21 
the police contacted by telephone said they arrested zheng 
20 last month but could not give other details hong kongs wen 
wei po newspaper which often has reliable reports on mainland 
affairs said zheng was traced by following a hong kong traveler 
who was found to be carrying a foreign passport with zhengs 
picture zheng apparently hoped to use the fake passport to escape 
guangzhou is about 60 miles west of hong kong and is a major 
transit point for people going to and from the british enclave two 
students on the mostwanted list wuer kaixi and li lu who 
escaped to the west did so through hong kong as did several older 
dissidents 
police have refused to comment on reports that the no 1 student 
on the wanted circular wang dan of beijing university was 
arrested 
there have been no reports that any of the arrested students 
have been tried 
eighteen people were executed wednesday in guangzhou according 
to the city intermediate peoples court but their crimes of theft 
or robbery were not related to the protests 
about 50 nonpolitical executions have been reported in the past 
two months executions in china are carried out with a bullet to 
the back of the head 
xinhua meanwhile said top party researchers and regional party 
officials took part in a fourday seminar on dengs 
partybuilding theory in the northeastern city of harbin the 
report said they concluded it was of great significance to 
study dengs theory which the theorists said had enriched and 
developed the theory of revolutionary leader mao tsetung xinhua 
did not explain dengs theory 
mao long has been heralded as chinas chief contributor to 
marxist theory the new attention to dengs role as a theorist 
comes as the entire nation is being required to study his june 9 
speech in which he praised the army for crushing the student 
protests 
although deng was recognized as the final arbiter of party 
policy before the crackdown he had maintained a relatively low 
profile appearing in public infrequently and rarely being quoted 
in the media since the crackdown however newspapers are full of 
admonitions to study his works and a major movie about his early 
revolutionary career has been released

capistrano but the geese have returned to capitol beach 
in late june about 100 geese were rounded up and shipped off by 
the state game and parks commission game and parks worker frank 
andelt predicted at that time theyll be back im not so sure 
that itll be the same geese but geese will be back 
state workers inspected last week and found a new gaggle 
without the identification bands used to tag the ones shipped 160 
miles southwest because they were bombarding capitol beach yards 
and water with unhealthy fallout 
capitol beach residents are worried theyll have the same 
problems again but have mixed feelings 
everybody seems to be quite happy that we have geese back 
here said marjorie reid secretary of the capitol beach 
community association well just have to wait until next spring 
to see how many stay around 
joe gabig waterfowl biologist at game and parks said im 
almost sure some geese will stay because it is a suitable 
habitat he said relocating the new birds would be very difficult 
this time of year geese can only be collected easily when adults 
are molting and goslings are too young to fly

officials today unveiled a 
50foot winged rocket of the sort that will be launched from a b52 
bomber in october in the first flight of a privately developed 
booster designed to put satellites in orbit at low cost 
the gleaming white pegasus rocket similar to the pioneering 
x15 rocket plane was rolled out of a hangar at nasas amesdryden 
flight research facility as 400 people watched and a high school 
band played 
antonio elias a scientist who originated the idea for orbital 
sciences corp noted its adaptation of technology from air force 
and navy missiles and declared pegasus a noteworthy example of 
swords turned into plowshares 
orbital sciences corp developed the rocket with hercules 
aerospace co orbital sciences spokeswoman barbara c zadina said 
that at a cost of 6 million to 8 million per launch we are 
lowering the threshold for getting into space 
while the pentagon and nasa are interested in using pegasus 
rockets for military and scientific projects youre going to see 
states small countries or university programs that want to get 
into space zadina said wednesday now for 6 million they 
can afford a dedicated launch 
before the challenger disaster in 1986 nasa was charging about 
35 million to deploy a large satellite last year nasa 
recommended a 110 million fee for a shuttle payload 
pegasus will allow small satellites to be launched at low cost 
for astronomy environmental and other research said robert pincus 
of the national aeronautics and space administrations goddard 
space flight center in greenbelt md 
an orbital sciences brochure calls pegasus a winged 
workhorse apparently after the winged horse of mythology 
the pegasus rocket unveiled today will not be the one launched 
in october instead it will be carried aloft under the wings of a 
nasa b52 for test flights later this month and in early october 
later in october another pegasus will be released from a b52 
about 40000 feet over the pacific ocean off the california coast 
the threestage rocket will ignite and carry into orbit a 
threepart payload named pegsat that contains nasa and pentagon 
experiments 
the first flight also may carry a small satellite that will be 
used by the state of virginia for environmental monitoring of 
chesapeake bay zadina said 
orbital sciences says the 41000pound pegasus is 492 feet 
long 50 inches in diameter and has a deltashaped wing with a 
22foot span 
it can carry into low earth orbit payloads up to 6 feet long 
almost four feet in diameter and weighing up to 900 pounds 
according to orbital sciences corp 
zadina said the date of the october pegasus launch remains to be 
scheduled and a second flight is due late this year or early in 
1990 
on the first flight pegasus will launch pegsat the first part 
of the triple payload is a small experimental navy communications 
relay satellite that will separate from pegsat once it is in orbit 
said pincus nasas pegsat project manager 
the navy wants to learn if such satellites can help it relay 
data collected by its weather and oceanographic research 
instruments according to a statement issued in may by the 
pentagons defense advanced research projects agency 
pegsat also will carry sensors to collect information on 
pegasus surroundings as it is launched that will help the effort 
to build lighter less expensive satellites pincus said 
sixty to 90 days after pegsat reaches orbit it will release its 
third payload a series of canisters that will release the 
chemical barium into space to help nasa scientists study earths 
magnetic field and the electrically charged particles trapped 
inside it he added 
orbital sciences and hercules announced in june that their first 
commercial customer is ball corp under an agreement pegasus 
rockets will be used to launch two ball communications satellites 
in 1990 or 1991

bees are a publicrelations nightmare but 
the busy little buzzers are vital to the nations food supply and 
have gotten a bum rap just because they sting say conventioneering 
beekeepers 
larry connor a consulting entomologist who conducted a public 
relations workshop described the publics attitude as the only 
good bug is a dead bug 
that feeling isnt shared by the 150 people at the fourday 
annual meeting of the western apicultural society a gathering of 
backyard beekeepers academics and a smattering of commercial 
apiculturalists a fancy word for beekeepers 
they speak in hushed tones about their favorite insect and its 
social structure a highly evolved system that one said makes us 
look like very hostile creatures talk about perfect social 
control 
you have to be kind of fascinated and drawn to it its just 
like a microcosm said mark jensen of los altos hills who 
started keeping bees 20 years ago when a friend had to get rid of a 
4h project now he keeps about 100 hives at several locations 
including 18 in his backyard 
its like a whole society he added its like youve got 
a window on a little nation almost 
a typical hive consists of 20000 to 50000 bees female workers 
make up the core of the colony and are overseen by one queen who 
controls her own fertility male honeybees called drones do not 
work or sting and are available for mating 
for nancy stewart bee behavior is captivating 
the women do all the work but when winter comes along they 
kick the males out she said they wont feed them anymore 
theyll die 
once stung by the beekeeping urge its hard to shake said 
helynn carrier coowner of a beekeeping supply shop in san jose 
they get bee fever and they just cant stand it she said 
you meet people whove been keeping bees and theyd almost rather 
give up their wife than their bees or their husband 
bees can help with human problems according to joe stone whos 
been using bee phobia in volunteer work with juvenile delinquents 
for 13 years 
if they can overcome their fear of working with bees they can 
overcome other fears said stone a retired government employee 
who works with the kern county probation department 
stones face lights up as he describes the pride youths take in 
learning to handle honeybees 
they just cant believe theyre doing this he said adding 
that two of his charges have gone on to build a beekeeping business 
of their own 
yet even the bees honey has a popularity problem in this 
country where per capita consumption barely exceeds a pound per 
year by contrast west germans consume three pounds of honey per 
person annually and canadians average 22 pounds 
thats where naomi gunter comes in as american honey queen 
1989 gunter of towner nd tours the land promoting honey while 
wearing a 10 beeshaped rhinestone ring a brochure of her own 
honey recipes includes glazed hamballs ranch beans and crispy 
cabbage slaw theres even a recipe for a honey facial 
california honey queen kimberly agnew of el monte calif 
showed off honeybees painted on her fingernails and hives on her

a mans plan to open his ranch to commercial 
trout fishing has angered his rural neighbors and led to complaints 
about gunshots vandalism and the poisoning of two ponds filled 
with dozens of large fish 
the neighbors including gonzo journalist hunter s 
thompson oppose the commercial fishing operation because they 
object to further development in the woody creek community outside 
aspen 
floyd watkins owner of beaver run ranch has reported several 
incidents in recent days including obscenities scrawled in his 
fresh concrete driveway shotgun blasts fired near his ranch and 
the nearfatal poisoning of his dog 
in addition he says someone erected a sign on his property 
saying fat floyds trout farm public fishing welcome and 
someone cut down signs on watkins property announcing the beaver 
run ranch 
there also have been several verbal confrontations including 
those involving watkins and thompson authorities said 
then the dispute escalated wednesday from the civil complaint 
level to a full criminal investigation with the poisoning of two 
fish ponds 
its gone beyond the shouting namecalling thing even the 
noisemaking side of it because now we have fish killed and 
poisoning of a waterway said pitkin county deputy sheriff 
michael kendrick it is now criminal in nature 
the sheriffs investigation includes a variety of other 
incidents that have been reported in the woody creek area a focal 
point of the investigation is the dispute between watkins and his 
neighbors 
people downstream along the creek were being warned against 
drinking the water eating fish from it or having livestock use the 
water until the poison that was used can be identified kendrick 
said 
mac myers deputy district attorney said prosecutors were 
reviewing the incidents and allegations to decide whether any 
charges would be filed 
samples of the dead fish and the water were sent for analysis 
the results were not immediately available pitkin county 
environmental health department officials said they suspect the 
substance used was rotenone an agent designed specifically to kill 
fish by reducing the oxygen content in water 
watkins reported 80 percent of the fish in two ponds on his 
property killed and estimated the loss at 3000 pounds of fish 
worth about 40000 
those fish up to 20pounds each are worth 500 bucks apiece 
these are trophy fish he said 
the substance apparently was put into the creek above watkins 
property sometime late tuesday with the fish kill evident on 
wednesday kendrick said 
we dont have any physical evidence tire tracks or boot 
prints kendrick said well probably find out what the 
chemical is but that wont necessarily lead us anywhere

the us customs service has confiscated some 
14 million worth of drug paraphernalia in the past 16 months but 
the agency still isnt clear on what items fall into that category 
an official said thursday 
the mail order drug paraphernalia control act of 1986 isnt 
specific enough john esau director of the customs service 
commercial fraud and enforcement center told the us 
international trade commission 
this particular law makes it extraordinarily difficult to 
define what is drug paraphernalia esau testified we are going 
to rely on the courts to help us define it 
among the factors the law allows customs to use to determine 
whether an item is drug paraphernalia are instructions provided 
with the item concerning its use advertising how it is displayed 
for sale and the existence and extent of the items legitimate uses 
representatives of the pipe business told the commission that 
manufacturers and retailers cant read consumers minds and cant 
be held responsible for illegal use of legitimate items 
i agree its tragic theres a drug problem in this country but 
a lack of imagination is the only limit to turning anything into 
drug paraphernalia businessman richard k rowland testified 
rowlands contempo tobacco products warehouse in nashville was 
raided in march thencustoms commissioner william von raab said at 
the time that the 306000 items seized filled eight 48foot 
containers and was the largest such seizure in us history 
the items being confiscated are similar or the same as items 
or materials that have been in the tobacco industry for hundreds of 
years rowland said 
what we in the tobacco industry need are some very specific 
guidelines as to what is and what is not drug paraphernalia and 
why rowland said are all glass pipes illegal are all wood 
pipes illegal are all stone pipes illegal or is there one type 
that is legal all im saying is give me the rules and let me steer 
clear of this legal minefield called the mail order drug 
paraphernalia control act 
the act calls for penalties of up to 3 years in prison and 
100000 in fines for each violation 
itc chairwoman anne e brunsdale pressed rowland and others to 
suggest guidelines 
lorraine shapiro of the mill in corning ny a manufacturer 
that uses imported woods in pipes and that lost some 45000 worth 
of inventory through a customsled raid in january was the only 
one who offered any ideas suggesting a minimum pipe bowl diameter 
of of an inch and a minimum stem length of 2 inches 
robert vaughn a nashville attorney representing the american 
pipe amp tobacco council inc an information clearinghouse said he 
would have to survey the 700 members of the american pipe and 
accessory league before offering any suggestions 
in addition to more specific definitions of drug paraphernalia 
esau said customs also wants to change required manifests to help 
the service narrow down questionable items 
for example he said all plastic bags being imported are listed 
simply as plastic bags not differentiating between huge garbage 
bags and 1inch square containers used by drug dealers as well as 
by such businesses as jewelers and makers of precision ball 
bearings 
having a separate manifest listing for such small bags he said 
would make the recipients of such imports easier to spot 
esau told the commission which is reviewing the imports at the 
request of the senate finance committee that most of the 
paraphernalia being seized comes from pacific basin countries and 
areas of the middle east in an interview he identified as 
exporters hong kong taiwan and japan and said the peoples 
republic of china and korea may also be exporters

prominent palestinians said thursday that plo 
chief yasser arafat may have a more flexible hand in pursuing his 
peace proposals after winning a vote of confidence from his fatah 
faction 
but israels foreign ministry said decisions of the fatah 
general congress this week represented a step backward from 
moderation a liberal israeli newspaper haaretz deplored the 
groups insistence on continued armed struggle 
the sixday meeting by more than 1000 fatah members which 
ended thursday overwhelmingly endorsed arafats policies which 
this year carried the palestine liberation organization to official 
recognition of israel 
it was seen by many mainstream palestinians in the 
israelioccupied territories as a triumph over hardliners who have 
opposed arafats turn to diplomacy in the plos efforts to win a 
palestinian state 
i think hes been given a free hand said george jakaman 
professor of philosophy at the west banks bir zeit university 
daoud kuttab a prominent palestinian journalist said 
arafats maneuverability has been enhanced both in the political 
resolutions and in the persons elected to top positions in fatah 
radwan abu ayyash a fatah supporter and head of the arab 
journalists association said in an interview that one of the 
reasons such a meeting was held was to give arafat more support 
more credibility among his own people in order to move ahead 
kuttab said arafats victory over hardliners signals to the 
smaller factions and to adversaries that when arafat is 
talking hes talking with the support of the vast majority of 
palestinians 
kuttab said the decisions give arafat greater power to explore 
israels proposal for elections in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip 
the fatah meeting left open the possibility of elections after 
an israeli troop withdrawal from the territories 
israels government approved a plan in may that calls for 
palestinians in the occupied lands to choose representatives who 
will negotiate limited autonomy as an interim solution final 
disposition of the west bank and gaza would be left until later 
if arafat wanted tommorrow to name a delegation to make 
initial negotiations with the israelis he can do this with more 
confidence than he could before kuttab said 
that prospect worries palestinian leftists who fear arafat has 
given up too much by accepting israel and by restricting 
palestinian guerrilla activity to military targets and israeliheld 
territory 
hardliners at the fatah congress won a call for the 
intensification of the armed struggle to put an end to the 
israeli occupation of palestinian territories 
that reiteration of fatahs traditional path of guerrilla 
action launched by arafat and a handful of colleagues in 1964 
chilled israeli views of the conference 
despite widespread recognition of the plo as the representive of 
the worlds 5 million palestinians israel has outlawed any 
dealings with the plo claiming the organization is a terrorist 
entity 
part of what they call armed struggle we call terrorism 
said israeli foreign ministry spokesman alon liel 
he noted the fatah statements did not explicitly repeat arafats 
dec 14 declaration renouncing terrorism recognizing israel and 
accepting a un resolution endorsing a landforpeace trade with 
israel 
israeli officials claims that fatah has launched 11 attacks and 
attempted attacks in israel since december casting doubt on its 
renunciation of terror

a fertility method new to the united states 
is safer and less expensive than other artificial methods a doctor 
said thursday in announcing the birth of twins to a couple who used 
the procedure 
in peritoneal ovum sperm transfer or post mature eggs are 
removed from the mothers ovaries and placed along with sperm into 
the peritoneal cavity near the ends of the fallopian tubes the 
egg enters the fallopian tubes where it is fertilized and travels 
to the uterus for the remainder of gestation 
unlike in vitro fertilization the procedure can be done in a 
doctors office in less than an hour with only local anesthesia 
said dr carolyn b coulam medical director of the center for 
reproduction and transplantation immunology at methodist hospital 
with no hospitalization required post costs about 4000 
compared with 6000 for in vitro fertilization coulam said 
the risks are remarkably less moreover the costs are less 
she said 
the doctor said jane and michael donlan of indianapolis became 
the parents of the first children conceived in the united states 
under the procedure craig thomas donlan who weighed 7 pounds 4 
ounces and his fraternal twin brother kyle robert at 6 pounds 6 
ounces were born 12 minutes apart saturday night without 
complications 
coulam said she believed the first children born under a similar 
post procedure were in london based on a report of three 
pregnancies there in 1987 she said she knows of no others 
we are just thrilled that this procedure has helped us extend 
our family and bring us these two beautiful babies mrs donlan 
said surrounded by her family including a 7yearold daughter 
erin its just really extremely frustrating to be infertile and 
not know why 
coulam said mrs donlan 35 suffered from unexplained 
infertility like about 20 percent of the 3 million infertile women 
in the united states such women may be able to bear children as a 
result of the post procedure but it will rarely help the remaining 
80 percent coulam said 
it does require the patient to have normal fallopian tubes so 
the fallopian tubes pick up the egg and transfer it to the 
uterus coulam said 
in in vitro fertilization the egg is fertilized by sperm in a 
laboratory dish and surgically transferred to the uterus under a 
third method gamete intrafallopian transfer or gift the egg and 
sperm are surgically transferred to the fallopian tubes for 
fertilization coulam said 
methodist the only hospital in the country federally approved 
to use the catheter that implants the eggs and sperm in post 
procedures has one other ongoing pregnancy and two that have 
failed including the first by the donlans in the past year 
coulam said 
mrs donlan and her 42yearold husband are computer programmers

prime minister toshiki kaifu held his first cabinet 
meeting thursday and promised political and tax reforms to win back 
support for his liberal democratic party 
i want this to be known as the cabinet of dialogue and 
reform kaifu told reporters before a brief induction ceremony 
before emperor akihito at the imperial palace 
the cabinet will ensure a balance of voices from the people 
he said there are both political reform and tax reform and i 
plan to do both reliably 
after the ceremony the ministers held their first meeting 
kaifu 58 was elected prime minister wednesday after two 
predecessors were forced out of office in the last 10 weeks 
naboru takeshita quit to take responsibility for an 
influencepeddling scandal sousuke uno resigned after the liberal 
democrats suffered a major loss in elections for parliaments upper 
house 
what is important above all is political ethics kaifu said 
without faith in us we will collapse 
news reports said kaifu planned to visit washington from sept 
39 and discuss with president bush moves to ease trade friction 
between the two countries 
a major issue for kaifu is how to respond to continuing us 
demands for greater access to japans markets opposition from 
farmers to a wider opening of japans market to agricultural 
imports was seen as factor in the liberal democrats loss in the 
upper house elections last month 
the new foreign minister taro nakayama said a us visit had 
not been decided upon 
hikaru matsunaga the new international trade minister said 
japan must increase its imports while maintaining a balance between 
economic growth led by domestic demand and protection of the 
environment 
finance minister minister ryutaro hashimoto ruled out repealing 
the widely opposed 3 percent sales tax that took effect in april 
a repeal move is likely to be launched in parliaments upper 
house where the liberal democrats lost their majority in the july 
23 election 
kaifu has pledged to review the tax reportedly planning to use 
revenues it generates toward welfare purposes 
women were particularly vocal in criticism of the new tax in 
addition they were incensed over reports that uno kept paid 
mistresses 
the womens vote was seen as one of the reasons for the liberal 
democratic loss in july 
the new cabinet includes women for the first time sumiko 
takahara a nonpolitician and economic expert who is head of the 
economic planning agency and lawmaker mayumi moriyama director of 
the environment agency 
by listening to the voice of the people i hope to reduce the 
gap between the people and the government kaifu said 
for that reason i chose people from outside government he 
said and to ensure a balance of voices from the people i 
highlighted the appointment of women

dexter king the youngest son of slain civil 
rights leader martin luther king jr has resigned as president of 
the center named for his father center officials confirmed 
thursday 
the resignation had been rumored for several days because of 
apparent rifts among the leadership of the martin luther king jr 
center for nonviolent social change over how it should be managed 
we regret to announce that dexter scott king has resigned his 
post as president said a statement from king center board 
chairman jesse hill jr 
it must be borne in mind that the changing circumstances 
staff and management changes and tragic assassinations have not 
changed this eternal commitment to social change through creative 
love and revolutionary nonviolence hill added 
hills statement did not elaborate on the reasons for dexter 
kings departure and neither he nor king immediately returned 
telephone calls thursday seeking comment 
in january the centers board of directors elected king 28 to 
take over the presidency from his mother coretta scott king who 
remained as chief executive officer he officially took over april 
4 the 21st anniversary of his fathers assassination

civil rights leaders in atlanta said this week that there has 
been conflict within the centers leadership over fiscal and 
personnel concerns and there were reports of a dispute between 
king and his mother 
mayor andrew young who was an aide to the rev martin luther 
king jr in the 60s was quoted by the atlanta 
journalconstitution as saying the resignation was part of a family 
dispute fueled by a generation gap 
city councilman hosea williams who also was a king aide said 
the center recently had begun to focus more on leading the civil 
rights movement placing itself in competition with the southern 
christian leadership conference founded by the elder king

a lesbian minister who claimed to be the 
victim of two antihomosexual assaults fabricated one of the 
attacks police said thursday 
we feel at this time the case is unfounded said police 
chief frank jordan referring to the second attack the rev lynn 
griffis had reported to authorities 
griffis an assistant pastor at the metropolitan community 
church had reported that she was attacked once by an intruder 
wielding a shovel and later by skinheads who abducted her and 
cut an inscription into her chest 
griffis 26 had blamed both attacks on antigay assailants and 
her case became a rallying point for ongoing efforts to fight 
socalled gay bashing 
at a news conference thursday jordan said the matter would be 
turned over to the district attorneys office 
he said an investigation into the first attack is continuing he 
declined to speculate on whether that case also might be shown to 
be unfounded 
when her version of the second attack was questioned griffis 
left san francisco her mother adele griffis told the associated 
press by telephone thursday that her daughter was at the family 
home near cozad neb but was not available for comment 
were just not going to be talking because theres been so 
much damage thats been done she said were just so 
heartbroken 
police and gay leaders in san francisco last week held a joint 
news conference that cast doubt on griffis account of the second 
attack that she reported last month 
the first attack was reported july 12 griffis told police a man 
broke into her home and struck her with a shovel she showed up at 
a news conference several hours after the reported assault with 
several stitches around her eye 
the assailant reportedly scribbled kill you fags on the 
wall the church also received a letter the day before the alleged 
attack containing death threats against griffis and pastor jim 
mitulski 
griffis who marries gay and lesbian couples as part of her 
pastoral duties said after the first reported attack that she 
would fight her attacker with love and with education 
in the second attack on july 27 griffis told police she was 
briefly abducted by two men she described as skinheads who made 
threats against her and cut her with a switchblade 
but aug 3 police confronted griffis with inconsistencies in 
her account of the second attack including evidence that her 
wounds were selfinflicted griffis then changed her account of the 
attack contending it was a sexual assault 
mitulski and the churchs board of directors had placed griffis 
on leave after the inconsistencies were publicized she later 
resigned 
the metropolitan community church is a nondenominational 
christian church that caters chiefly to homosexuals it has 
branches in several cities 
another alleged attack by skinheads in san francisco has 
also been called into question 
in april syndicated talk show host morton downey jr said he 
had been attacked by neonazi skinheads in a restroom at san 
francisco international airport he said they tried to shave his 
head and scribbled reverse swastikas on is face and clothing but 
airport authorities said they could not substantiate any of his 
claims downeys talk show has since been canceled

the state has adopted a policy allowing 
people to register to vote even if they have no residence other 
than a park bench a decision praised by an organization for the 
homeless 
to the best of our knowledge maine is the only state to 
handle it in this manner without prodding from the courts said 
richard pinner at the new york office of the national coalition for 
the homeless 
as a matter of symbolism i think its good pinner said 
secretary of state g william diamond said wednesday that even 
if people claim a park bench as their residence and a food bank as 
their mailing address they must be permitted to register to vote 
he said all reasonable action must be taken to ensure the voting 
rights of the homeless 
any denial leaves a homeless person whose survival depends on 
political decisions with no political recourse diamond said 
he outlined the policy in a letter to registrars citing 
successful court challenges in other states to residence 
requirements that restrict the voting rights of the homeless 
the president of the maine town and city clerks association 
whose members had expressed concern to diamond about the lack of a 
consistent policy on homeless voters said his liberal 
interpretation of residency requirements probably would generate 
opposition particularly in rural areas 
some of the clerks are not going to be happy with that said 
brenda caldwell town clerk in gorham 
diamond said estimates of homeless people living in maine range 
from 500 to 2000 
in portland maines most populous city a registrar said 
officials in recent years have routinely assigned homeless people 
the address of city hall so they may vote

walkouts spread thursday in estonia to include up 
to 20000 workers and protest leaders said they had no plans to 
call off the 2dayold protest against a new election law reports 
from the baltic republic said 
in a bid to stop the strike the estonian parliament passed a 
resolution thursday suspending all strikes at enterprises and 
organizations in estonia tass reported 
the official news agency said the decree would take effect as 
soon as it was published and directed the government to ensure 
uninterrupted functioning of the estonian economy and services to 
the population 
the strike by nonestonian workers was sparked by a new law that 
tightens residency requirements for voting and holding office 
nonestonian residents of the republic complain that the law which 
was passed tuesday by the republics parliament is aimed against 
them because many are new arrivals 
an editor at estonian radio maarika saarna put the number of 
strikers at 20000 but cautioned it could be exaggerated because it 
was based largely on reports from the strikers themselves 
strike committee member artur kopykin refused to estimate the 
number of strikers but said 37 enterprises had joined the walkout 
on wednesday 22 enterprises were reported on strike including 
shipyards and a motor works 
kopykin said the government had not begun negotiations with 
strikers and has made no move to come toward us 
until the government starts negotiations there can be no talk 
about stopping the strike he said by telephone from tallinn the 
republics capital 
saarna said strike agitators were trying to stir up nonestonian 
workers by warning them they would soon be treated as badly as 
blacks under apartheid in south africa 
if you tell a rather illiterate person that this is our last 
chance and otherwise well be kicked out of course hell strike 
she said in a telephone interview 
the government newspaper izvestia reported thursday that 
alienation is growing between two groups of the population in 
estonia 
it said that on tallinns central square estonians have set up 
a protest mourning the death of an estonian who was killed saturday 
night in a drunken brawl with a russian they hold signs saying 
on this spot a drunken russian from moscow killed an estonian 
boy izvestia said 
yevgeny kogan an ethnic russian and leader of the intermovement 
group that lobbies for nonestonians interests said strikers were 
demanding the republics parliament reconsider discriminative 
parts of the law on elections and another law making estonian the 
republics official language 
he said in an interview thursday the new election law would 
deprive tens of thousands of people of the right to vote the new 
law requires that candidates for elective office live in the same 
place for five years or in estonia for 10 years voters must have 
lived in the same district for two years or in estonia for five 
kopykin claimed the strike had virtually paralyzed the railroads 
in estonia and had spread to the construction industry 
some disruption in morning bus traffic was reported in tallinn 
but drivers were brought in from out of town to fill in saarna 
said 
ethnic estonians make up slightly more than 60 percent of the 
population and pushed the law to protect themselves from an influx 
of other nationalities russians make up about a third of estonias 
16 million people

a farmer who spent years developing a 
crop of organically grown beans saw his effort wasted in a few 
airplane passes when his field was accidentally sprayed with 
pesticides 
in my mind the beans are not only ruined but the ground is 
contaminated said peter eriksen who has been farming pinto and 
garden beans without chemicals for 13 years this is quite 
devastating to me 
years of building the fields fertility through the spreading 
of manure and other organic means were ruined eriksen said 
im different than commercial chemical farmers in that i 
consider the soil to be a biologically active and its a fact not 
just my belief eriksen said 
the state department of agriculture which started an organic 
certification program last year is investigating the accidental 
spraying department officials say it will be three years before 
they can once again certify crops grown on eriksens 60acre 
sprayed field as organic 
that about makes me cry eriksen said 
eriksen was tending to his sloping field on the west end of this 
central washington town on july 18 when he noticed two lowflying 
airplanes overhead 
from my vantage point i couldnt determine if he was spraying 
on a neighbors field or on my field then i could see when he 
came around again that he was spraying in my field 
the second plane started spraying on the west side 
ericksen said he frantically waved his arms to signal one of the 
pilots but to no avail he then picked up a 4inch aluminum pipe 
and began waving that the planes finally flew away 
pilot randy ferguson of stephens flying service who was 
contracted to spray neighboring farms said he thought the farmer 
was trying to warn him away from cattle 
we were in an area where we normally dont fly beans look 
like beans from an airplane said ferguson who has been in the 
business for 13 years and said he didnt know there were organic 
crops in grant county 
the planes apparently mistook eriksens field for one a couple 
of miles southwest 
eriksen said a seattle insurance agent for the flying service 
told him the maximum liability of the policy was 100000 he said 
he plans to file a lawsuit seeking well well above that amount 
eriksen estimated that his organic beans could have brought him 
twice the price of a regular crop because of the growing demand for 
pesticidefree foods carrie west of the agriculture departments 
certification program advisory board agreed 
there are 150 farmers most in eastern washington who received 
organic certification from the state agriculture department this 
year said program manager verne hedlund

the son of a reputed mafia boss threw a 
72000 wedding party worthy of royalty for his daughter just 
three months after taxpayers picked up the tab for his attorneys 
fee prosecutors said 
salvatore bill bonanno had claimed he was too poor to pay 
his attorney 19250 for appealing his convictions in a 
homeimprovement scam 
the october 1988 wedding party came complete with filet mignon 
ice sculptures and a 14piece orchestra state deputy attorney 
general derald granberg said in papers filed wednesday in superior 
court 
granberg who successfully prosecuted bonanno for bilking four 
elderly alameda county residents of more than 40000 in the late 
1970s is objecting to bonannos latest attempt to avoid serving a 
fouryear term 
this defendant belongs in state prison it is as simple as 
that granberg said 
bonanno 57 is the son of reputed mob boss joseph bonanno sr 
the younger bonanno is scheduled to return to court aug 18 when 
he is scheduled to begin serving his sentence superior court judge 
joseph karesh is expected to decide between prison and probation 
karesh sentenced bonanno in march 1986 for his convictions four 
months earlier on eight counts of grand theft and conspiracy to 
commit theft for the bogus homeimprovement contracts 
bonanno however was allowed to remain free on 50000 bail 
while he unsucessfully appealed his convictions karesh then 
ordered bonanno to surrender june 16 but allowed a twomonth delay 
to help his 84yearold father who is facing charges of refusing 
to testify before a federal grand jury in new york 
but last month bonannos lawyer charles garry asked karesh to 
modify the fouryear sentence to probation garry said that since 
the sentence bonanno has lived an utterly blameless life 
granberg called bonanno the dominant member of the 
conspiracy and criticized garry for accepting public funds to 
represent bonanno 
granberg said bonanno is being sued by the fairmont hotel in san 
jose for failing to pay most of the 72000 tab for the wedding 
party of his daughter felippa 
the conclusion suggested by this scenario is that the 
defendant perpetrated a fraud upon either the state or the hotel 
or both granberg said

wednesday which wounded five israeli soldiers and a member of the 
allied south lebanon army militia 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah spiritual adviser of 
hezbollah called it a down payment of retaliation for israels 
abduction july 28 of sheik abdul karim obeid a shiite cleric 
affiliated with the organization 
much more will follow fadlallah said hezbollah whose name 
means party of god said the explosivesladen pickup was driven by 
a 24yearold shiite clergyman 
a un source speaking anonymously said the predominantly 
christian militia was conducting housetohouse roundups in ibl 
elsaqi and rashaya villages in the security zone israel 
maintains just north of its border 
the sla militiamen threw hand grenades at the norwegian 
soldiers manning a checkpoint there he said 
timur goksel spokesman for the peacekeepers said grenades were 
drawn but not thrown he said the two norwegians were injured 
wednesday by flying stones when militiamen fired at their legs

checkpoint goksel said they put a gun at a mans head and then 
they pulled out hand grenades then they began firing at the ground 
and the soldiers legs 
he said the second incident was similar 
another un official said privately the un command told the 
israeli army they control these guys and they should exercise 
more of that control before somebody gets killed 
an iranian newspaper said thursday indirect talks between iran 
and the united states on the hostage situation would begin within 
days 
irans official islamic republic news agency quoted the 
englishlanguage tehran times which is close to president hashemi 
rafsanjani as saying talks would be conducted through a third 
country probably pakistan 
later thursday however the agency issued a dispatch saying 
reports of talks with the united states were suspicious and 
quoted sources as saying none were being held 
it quoted one unidentified source as saying the united states 
had sent messages through certain third governments but they 
were rejected because some had an insolent tone 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said it 
was premature to expect direct talks with tehran and were 
nowhere near that but indicated indirect contacts would continue 
sixteen western hostages are held in lebanon including eight 
americans israel has offered to trade obeid and the estimated 
300400 other shiites it holds for three israeli soldiers held in

free foreign hostages and israeli prisoners 
avi pazner said the decision was reached in a 10minute 
telephone call wednesday from shamir to bush pazners office said 
bush did not mention the obeid abuction which the united states 
has criticized 
fitzwater said weve generally tried to be forthcoming with 
what we are doing and they have been forthcoming wth what theyre 
doing however i would not characterize it as coordination 
in a statement released thursday bush said this sunday 
millions of americans of every faith will attend worship services 
i ask that each of you say a special prayer for the 
american hostages being held in lebanon 
ashshiraa a beirut weekly quoted nonarab sources as 
saying armed women were moving the hostages to new hideouts in 
beirut and its suburbs the paper said the women dressed in long 
black chadors worked at night carrying automatic weapons to be 
used only under utmost necessity 
its report could not be verified independently ashshiraa 
gained recognition in november 1986 with the first story about the 
irancontra deal to exchange us arms for hostages its recent 
reporting on the hostages has not been accurate 
the south lebanon army radio voice of the south said the 
militiamen rounded up several young shiite men it said most of the 
arrests were made in khiyam village where about 50000 shiites 
live 
khiyam also is in the buffer zone an area 6 to 10 miles deep 
patrolled by israel soldiers and the surrogate militia 
uri lubrani israels coordinator for south lebanon said 
wednesday the israelis would retaliate for the attack on the 
convoy but did not say where or when 
a statement from the sla militia command said without 
elaborating that gateways to the security zone from the rest 
of lebanon would be closed until sunday a south lebanon security 
source said the sla wanted to prevent possible collaborators with 
the suicide bomber from leaving the zone 
police said hezbollah was abandoning regular bases as a 
precaution against israeli air strikes 
a police spokesman said small groups of hezbollah fighters 
carrying shoulderfired sam7 missiles were seen overnight moving 
into wooded mountain slopes that surround the syrianoccupied bekaa 
valley in eastern lebanon 
in south beirut he said hezbollah had moved into a chain of 
basements and underground shelters 
hezbollah has refused to negotiate a prisoner exchange with 
israel it said the west should force israel to free obeid and 
described israels claims about statements the cleric made under 
interrogation as false and misleading 
israeli officials have said obeid confessed to helping plan 
attacks on israel and the abduction feb 17 1988 of lt col 
william higgins while he was on un duty in south lebanon

members of a commission 
promoting peace talks between the rightist government and 
marxistled insurgents said thursday they found good will and 
determination to resolve the nearly 10yearold war 
the commission which comprises the three main opposition 
parties spoke just hours after rebels used a dump truck to plow 
through a sentry position and attack an army post in the capitals 
northern sector 
officials of the christian democratic party the national 
reconciliation party and the democratic convergence are included in 
the commission 
the christian democrats handed over power on june 1 to president 
alfredo cristiani of the rightist republican nationalist alliance 
or arena which won a landslide victory in march presidential 
elections 
four rounds of negotiations between 1984 and 1987 failed to end 
the civil war in which about 70000 people have died 
in his inaugural address cristiani offered to talk with the 
rebel farabundo marti national liberation front but the insurgents 
rejected the mechanism for dialogue a nongovernmental commission 
suggested by the new president 
the rebels want direct highlevel negotiations with the 
government 
we have found that the political will to dialogue exists on 
both sides there are points of agreement but there is also 
distance and mistrust said oppositon leader hugo carrillo we 
of the opposition political parties are serving as promoters of 
dialogue in an effort to narrow that difference 
central american presidents who met earlier this week in tela 
honduras urged that salvadoran peace negotiations be resumed 
commission members met in late july with rebel commanders in 
mexico city and this week with cristiani they said both sides 
encouraged them to continue the effort to create conditions for 
talks 
they said they expected both sides to make concrete gestures 
to emphasize their dedication to achieving a negotiated peace 
carrillo said the commission had not discussed with the two sides 
what such measures might be 
but carrillo mentioned as possibilities a rebel ceasefire and 
an end to a government attempt to pass laws considered repressive 
by the opposition 
cristiani has said he plans to introduce draft legislation 
giving the police armed forces and courts a freer hand in moving 
against suspected subversives the oppositon and human rights 
organizations have described the proposed measures as totalitarian 
the rebel attack began at dawn at the army post in mejicanos in 
northern san salvador sgt arturo melendez post commander said 
one soldier and one civilian were wounded 
another guerrilla squad ambushed a truck carrying national guard 
members to reinforce the mejicanos post killing one trooper and 
wounding two authorities said 
melendez told journalists that about 30 insurgents fired 
rocketpropelled grenades at the post and sprayed it with automatic 
weapons fire 
the attack began when guerrillas aboard a dump truck smashed 
through a roadblock on the posts perimeter the rebels also fired 
grenades at the mejicanos town hall destroying its door 
about 8000 leftist rebels have waged a nearly decadelong 
battle against the usbacked governments in el salvador they say 
they want to change the economic system that has enriched a tiny 
minority while leaving most salvadorans destitute

the agriculture department on thursday 
estimated soviet grain production this year at 200 million metric 
tons 10 million below earlier forecasts and said there would be a 
resulting rise in imports 
the department estimated grain imports by the soviets in the 
year that began july 1 at 36 million tons 3 million above previous 
estimates 
hot and dry weather across many of the spring wheatgrowing 
regions of the soviet union combined with a shrinkage in the 
growing area are causing the drop according to a report from the 
foreign agriculture service 
it estimated wheat production down 45 million tons to 87 
million while coarse grains decreased by 55 million to 100 
million 
over the last 14 years soviet grain production fell to its 
lowest level 1401 million metric tons in 1975 and climbed to its 
high of 2374 million in 1978 grain production reached 2114 
million in 1987 and 1951 million last year 
this year favorable conditions across much of the european 
portion of the soviet union have failed to fully offset hot and dry 
weather baking out soil moisture from the eastern urals to western 
sibera usda said it said cooler weather and showers in the last 
week came too late to rescue spring grains

president bush on thursday formally designated 
a 397squareacre region off northern california as a national 
marine sanctuary outlawing oil gas and mineral exploration there 
bush signed a housesenate resolution to implement the ban in 
the cordell bank national marine sanctuary offshore from point 
reyes in what is considered one of the wests most sensitive 
marine regions 
the move brought praise from rep barbara boxer dcalif who 
urged a permanent ban on oil and gas drilling for all marine 
sanctuaries as proposed in legislation she has sponsored with rep 
leon panetta dcalif 
the marine sanctuary lies within lease sale 119 which covers a 
massive part of the outer continental shelf off central california 
where oil exploration could have begun as early as 1991 without the 
ban 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration when 
initially proposing cordell bank as a marine sanctuary during the 
reagan administration did not propose to ban oil and gas 
exploration 
subsequently the agency did push for such a ban but faced 
objections from the interior department until the white house sided 
with noaa according to congressional and administration sources 
congress which has the power to disapprove a marine sanctuary 
designation or change the terms governing it accepted language by 
west coast lawmakers to include the ban 
we had no objection to that said white house spokesman 
steve hart 
the administration was moving ahead to do exactly this 
through regulatory procedures as distinct from the congressional 
action which makes the ban a law said another official 
the sanctuary is 20 nautical miles west of point reyes and 50 
nautical miles west northwest of san francisco just north of the 
farellones national marine sanctuary 
cordell bank forms an underwater plateau 300 to 400 feet below 
the surface with pinnacles and ridges that rise to within 115 feet 
of the surface 
nutrients combined with high light penetration produce a unique 
biological community of algae invertebrates fish marine mammals 
and seabirds including the humpback whale and shorttailed 
albatross noaa reports say 
the house vote last june to ban offshore drilling in the 
sanctuary was the first approval of a permanent ban on offshore 
drilling by a chamber of congress 
temporary renewable moratoriums have been enacted repeatedly 
along the california coast blocking new drilling for the last 
eight years

ammunition for an extended siege shot his wife to death then drove 
to a post office and killed two coworkers before ending the spree 
with a gun blast to his head police said 
john merlin taylor was brain dead at a hospital after the 
shootings at the postal services downtown orange glen substation

all over the floor there said police lt earl callander there 
is also a box of about 100 rounds that apparently was going to be 
used for reloading 
taylor who had received numerous modelemployee awards during 
his 27 years with the postal service had discussed a similar 
outburst in a post office two days earlier a friend said 
callander said taylor was carrying a handgun and ammunition when 
he entered an employee entrance and began shooting at about 730 
am 
we have no indication he was looking for a specific person or 
a target it was a high standard 22caliber that shoots long rifle 
bullets that can be deadly when it hits its target the 
lieutenant said 
in addition to the two employees killed another was shot in the 
arm and several others suffered minor injuries in the panic to flee 
the building 30 miles northeast of downtown san diego 
taylor 52 was taken to palomar hospital where he was declared 
brain dead said police spokeswoman susan reierson hospital 
spokeswoman pat rarus would only say hes very very critical 
and on life support systems 
i heard a low popping at first then a banging said window 
clerk william karlson the first thing that i knew something was 
really serious was when clerk roger hutchinson yelled this is 
for real clear the building everybody get out 
then i saw taylor walking with his gun i was in an aisle but 
he didnt look at me i left the building and when i came back 
roger said he taylor had shot himself 
afterward police went to taylors escondido home and found his 
wife elizabeth dead from a gunshot wound reierson said 
taylor had worked as a letter carrier for 27 years and was 
nearing retirement and postal service spokesman bob henley said he 
was being considered for another quarterly performance award but 
declined nomination 
i have gotten it numerous times and would rather someone else 
have a chance at it henley quoted taylor as saying 
on tuesday taylor mentioned a 1986 oklahoma post office 
shooting in which 15 people were killed during a discussion with 
friend and coworker johnny sims 
we were talking about something and got around to saying 
what if something happened to one of the employees that would have 
gotten him mad and to go berserk we were just joking around 
said sims adding he was surprised by the violence 
john was a happygolucky guy always you could never make him 
mad he said he was not at the post office at the time of the 
shootings 
on aug 20 1986 parttime letter carrier patrick sherrill

the nose of a trump shuttle jet skidded down a 
runway throwing out a spray of sparks and smoke after the boeing 
727 landed thursday with its nose landing gear still retracted 
there were no injuries among the 47 passengers and seven 
crewmembers on the boeing 727 according to trump shuttle officials 
it was like a roller coaster ride like at coney island and i 
enjoyed that you prepare yourself for the worst but it was really 
just like a rough regular landing said passenger glenn porter of 
new york 
the pilot did an outstanding job faa spokesman john mogul 
said the pilot held the nose off the ground then lowered the 
nose slowly to the runway 
the pilot capt robert smith deemphasized his efforts and 
said 727s are fabulous aircraft 
this was all in a days work as far as im concerned said 
smith 47 a former navy pilot 
he flew for eastern airlines for 19 years before billionaire new 
york city developer donald trump bought easterns shuttle 
including planes and landing rights for 365 million and 
inaugurated service under his own name on june 8 the shuttle 
offers frequent service among boston new york and washington 
trump flew into boston for an afternoon news conference 
i think the whole crew is made up of heroes said trump 
adding that he did not anticipate any negative customer reaction 
over the incident 
i think the public confidence might be greater because of our 
crew trump said 
the plane coming from new yorks laguardia airport circled 
boston for nearly an hour dumping fuel over the ocean and flying 
rollercoaster gforce maneuvers trying to shake the nose gear 
loose the jet also made one rough touchandgo landing banging 
the main landing gear onto the ground and taking off again in an 
effort to jar the front landing gear loose from its housing 
after circling several more times smith settled the main 
landing gear onto the runway and held the nose up as long as he 
could 
the people in the front were screaming and yelling said 
james moriarty of new york the pilot said be prepared for metal 
on concrete so thats what we were preparing for it wasnt that 
bad though you felt like you were just waiting for the nose to 
drop 
many passengers said the scariest moments came after the 
landing when firefighters sprayed the plane with foam and they 
rushed to slide down emergency chutes 
it was the second emergency landing involving a landing gear 
problem in a little over a week in the united states on aug 2 a 
piedmont airlines boeing 737 with 100 people aboard scraped its 
left wing and engine at greensboro nc after its left main 
landing gear jammed no one was injured 
trump shuttle president bruce nobles said the jet involved in 
thursdays emergency landing had been in service since january 
1970 but said age was an unlikely factor in the incident 
the national transportation safety board was investigating 
passengers aboard the trump plane said they had plenty of 
warning 
when they first said they had problems everybody was just 
kind of joking about it said charlie cormay of sudbury once 
we realized there was going to be a crash landing everybody got 
pretty solemn 
when the plane finally came in for its landing cormay said a 
few prayers went through his mind 
they prepared us very well said kathy hussey of new york 
city who had come to boston for a business meeting by the time 
we landed we were all very happy and relieved 
suddenly you were on the runway with foam on your face and on 
your back she said adding that she probably would take the 
train back to new york 
passenger moriarty said many of the travelers were on business 
which he credited with the calm atmosphere they were thinking of 
their business appointments he said 
however he added people were holding hands with strangers 
which i thought was a nice gesture

the states most famous tourists george 
and barbara bush are lampooned in a new comic book that features 
them traveling incognito through maine to escape the pressures of 
the white house 
we thought this was too good not to do cartoonist jeff pert 
said thursday after the comic he and thomas wilson created on 
the road with george amp barbara in vacationland had been on the 
stands in maine and washington just two days 
we just thought it was a perfect market for a humorous 
perspective of the president since he has a summer home here 
pert said in an interview we saw it as a vehicle that would 
appeal to both the tourists visiting maine and the locals 
the story begins with bush and the socalled first dog millie 
being invaded by a herd of journalists while theyre fighting over 
a bar of soap in the white house bathroom to get away from it all 
bush and the first lady disguise themselves as tourists they 
realize they have everybody fooled when the secret service doesnt 
even recognize them as they take off for vacationland as maine 
calls itself on auto license plates 
their adventures take them through numerous scenes peppered with 
inside humor such as references to real estate developers who are 
hated by thousands of mainers and stephen king the famous horror 
writer who lives in bangor in one frame the bushes find that the 
first lighthouse they run into has been turned into a condominium 
and the first lobstermen they meet does not live in a quaint 
fishing village as they expected 
quaint fishermen aint lived in quaint fishing villages ever 
since quaint outofstaters bought every quaint damn yard of quaint 
shore property the lobsterman says the bushes themselves have 
been accused by some of spoiling the atmosphere of kennebunkport 
as secret service agents and members of the national press corps 
pour into the tiny fishing town whenever the president visits his 
estate on walkers point 
pert 30 a warehouse worker who draws cartoons for the weekly 
maine times and the times record in brunswick and wilson 29 a 
graphic designer who draws cartoons for the journal tribune in 
biddeford decided theyd collaborate on the book after they met at 
a trade convention in april 
they said they couldnt resist taking a few digs at bush 
hitting on the wimp factor that dogged him on the campaign 
trail but they insist they are much kinder and gentler than the 
doonesbury strips that portray bush as invisible 
when we sat down to do it i dont think we said were going 
to be very hard on him or very easy pert said what weve come 
up with here is a lot softer than say doonesbury 
still the two are unsure how the president will react if and 
when he sees the book during an extended vacation to kennebunkport 
that begins next week 
im sure when he gets here for vacation pert pauses 
well be marked men wilson answers

the soviet union is supplying 
afghanistan with new mig29 fighters and the latest sukhoi 
groundattack jets in case of an attack by pakistan an afghan 
general said thursday 
the communist government has repeatedly accused pakistan 
afghanistans eastern neighbor of direct involvement in the afghan 
civil war the most active moslem guerrilla groups are based there 
lt gen abdul haq ulumi a member of the supreme military 
council said the contract for mig29s and su27s has been 
completed but he would not give the number of aircraft 
soon they will come we will use them if necessary he said 
in an interview with several western television journalists 
yuli m vorontsov the soviet ambassador said in june that the 
kremlin was ready to meet an afghan request for mig29s and the 
latest sukhois if fighting and border violations increased 
a us official was quoted at the time as saying delivery of the 
planes would raise very serious questions not simply about 
afghanistan but about soviet interest in improved relations with 
the united states more generally 
the soviets have complained publicly about increased us arms 
shipments to the insurgents 
moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 soviet military forces entered afghanistan in december 1979 
and completed a unmediated withdrawal a decade later feb 15 of 
this year 
washington accuses moscow of nearly doubling arms shipments to 
afghanistan since the withdrawal 
last month a us official said the soviets were shipping from 
25 billion to 3 billion worth of weapons a year to afghanistan 
us shipments to the guerrillas via pakistan were valued at 
slightly more than 600 million 
both nations are guarantors of the april 1988 agreement 
providing for soviet military withdrawal and an end to involvement 
in afghanistan they regularly accuse each other of violating its 
provisions 
us officials said last month american arms shipments to the 
guerrillas would continue they have been quoted as saying the 
insurgents willl get new weapons to counter highaltitude bombing 
attacks and disable runways at air bases 
ulumi who represents the armed forces on the communist party 
central committee mentioned the aircraft when asked whether 
afghanistan would be getting new weapons 
the soviets have promised to give us new weapons he said 
these are aircraft which are to defend afghanistan in the face of 
a possible pakistani air attack 
asked what kind of aircraft he replied mig29s and su27s 
the numbers are secret the contract has been completed 
rockets hit kabul for the seventh day in a row thursday killing 
nine civilians all but one at a bus stop near the airport the 
government said sixteen people were reported wounded 
at least seven rockets struck near the airport and in 
northwestern kabul said mohammad nabi amani the foreign ministry 
spokesman 
he said 16 rockets hit the capital wednesday killing one person 
and wounding 15 
in the past week more than 150 surfacetosurface missiles have 
landed in the city killing 30 people and wounding about 140 by

the roman catholic church on thursday 
suspended an agreement to move nuns from a convent on the edge of 
auschwitz and blamed jewish groups for creating an atmosphere of 
aggressive demands 
the world jewish congress which coordinated a campaign to move 
the convent called cardinal franciszek macharskis announcement 
a tragic blow and urged the vatican to overturn it 
a signer of the 1987 accord between jewish leaders and catholic 
bishops said the statement was absolutely unacceptable 
macharski whose krakow archdiocese includes the former 
concentration camp and the convent in the southern city of 
oswiecim said conditions make it impossible to carry out the 
pact which was signed in geneva 
under the agreement the nuns were to be moved to a prayer 
center to be built several thousand yards away from the 
concentration camp 
although not stating specifically that the relocation has been 
canceled it appeared from macharskis statement carried by 
staterun pap news agency the project is blocked indefinitely 
in rome vatican radio carried the statement without comment 
recent protests by jewish groups at the convent located since 
1984 in a restored theater abutting the camps barbedwire fence 
have destroyed the atmosphere needed to create the new interfaith 
prayer center macharski said 
at the foundation of an act of peace there must be the wish 
for peace he said 
jewish groups say the convent and its religious symbols 
including a 23foot wooden cross at the auschwitzbirkenau complex 
are offensive an estimated 25 million jews were killed at the 
camp during adolf hitlers drive to annihilate jews in europe 
macharskis statements constitute a tragic blow to all of us 
in the jewish and catholic world who have worked so long to foster 
mutual understanding and respect the world jewish congress said 
in a statement in washington 
silence by the vatican on this occasion would repeat a 
historical tragedy the statement said referring to the 
vaticans alleged failure to prevent the world war ii genocide of 
european jews 
it is an absolutely unacceptable act to break an agreement 
that he macharski has failed to respect already as of february 
said dr ludwig ehrlig european director of bnai brith who 
signed the 1987 agreement 
a nun who answered the convents telephone thursday said the 
community knew nothing of macharskis statement and the sisters 
were not authorized to comment 
polish public opinion has been mainly against moving the 
cloister poles who are overwhelmingly roman catholic argue that 
tens of thousands of catholics including priests and nuns were 
put to death at the camp and that the nuns should be allowed to 
pray for them 
demonstrations outside the convent by visiting jews intensified 
this year after the church missed a promised february deadline for 
moving the nuns 
on july 14 seven american jewish men climbed a fence and 
occupied the convent grounds for several hours before being 
forcibly evicted by polish construction workers 
delays in keeping the unrealistic date of constructing the 
center caused on the side of some western jewish communities a 
violent campaign of accusations and slanders macharski said 
the human and christian dignity of the nuns was not respected 
the peace to which they are entitled was disturbed the statement 
said 
such attitudes and actions make it impossible for me to 
continue further realization of the construction of the center in 
this atmosphere of aggressive demandsit is not possible to 
together care for the construction of a place of mutual respect 
without abandoning ones religious and national beliefs 
work had never begun on the new center although church 
officials said they were buying land for it

the fourstar army general will be the 12th man to hold the 
position of top military adviser to the nations commanderinchief 
bush and powell draw on a yearslong relationship honed inside 
the white house when both served under president reagan 
their shared easygoing style was evident during thursdays rose 
garden nomination ceremony when reporters started to pop questions 
shall we go before they reporters start getting excited 
bush quipped to powell who chuckled as they turned toward the oval 
office 
while the general is known for a tough businesslike approach 
and intellectual demeanor hes also got a ready smile and keen 
sense of humor 
on one of president reagans annual palm springs vacation trips 
powell joined white house spokesman marlin fitzwater at the press 
corps traditional new years eve family party even going so far 
as to don a funny hat and toot on a noisemaker as midnight arrived 
he can make fun of himself he can be very funny and not be 
silly but he never loses his dignity said dan howard the 
former spokesman for the national security council who worked with 
powell at the white house 
he was marvelous to work with because he could deal with all 
the internal conflicts that the national security adviser must 
resolve for the president said howard recently confirmed as 
undersecretary of the navy 
colin was an honest broker he was very fair in presenting 
others viewpoints that doesnt mean he didnt have one because 
he did he was just very fair and could present all sides without 
putting a spin on it thats a rare talent in this town howard 
said 
such abilities will be essential when powell is called upon to 
deal with the pentagons intense interservice rivalries contests 
among the services branches are widely expected to reach new highs 
as the military budget shrinks and the assessment of the soviet 
threat diminishes 
as well powell is seen as a wise choice by those who have seen 
the role of chairman evolve into one where diplomacy and political 
finesse with congress are as essential as tough battlefield 
instincts 
the chairmanships political now observed one senior 
pentagon official who spoke on condition he not be identified 
powells got great political adroitness hell get a great 
reception on capitol hill and hes got experience dealing with the 
soviets 
powells nomination was met with surprise by some in the 
pentagon given that his political credentials are deemed to have 
outweighed his military experience but those who know him contend 
that his mix of jobs in command roles and political trenches of 
washington will stand him in good stead 
hes been head of the nsc hes commanded troops in europe 
hes dealt with the guard and reserve in his current post and hes 
been at the elbow of the secretary of defense hes had experiences 
few can match said robert sims a former pentagon spokesman who 
knew powell when he served as defense secretary caspar weinbergers 
military aide 
hes had a lot of staff jobs because hes so good sims 
said hes an excellent choice and extraordinary leader and a 
great human being 
sims and howard both agreed that powell can be expected to keep 
his political views to himself and take a pragmatic approach 
he plays those things close to the vest he cares intensely 
about such things but hes not driven by ideology howard said 
the issue of race is one that has rarely been mentioned by 
powell but his acquaintances say it is not the reason he was been 
chosen 
powell has rarely spoken of race in public but a speech at a 
meeting last year of the joint center for political studies a 
black think tank in washington he recalled those who suffered 
and sacrificed to create the conditions and set the stage for me 
and i am also mindful that the struggle against racism is 
not over until every american is able to find his or her own 
place in our society limited only by his or her own ability and his 
or her own dream he said

two us congressmen said thursday their visit to 
a prison camp in the ural mountains convinced them the soviet union 
is still holding political prisoners 
reps frank wolf rva and christopher smith rnj who 
visited the perm 35 labor camp on wednesday and interviewed 24 
prisoners said they could not specify how many were being held for 
their political beliefs 
but wolf said many or most said they were political 
prisoners and we believe that they are 
the congressmen said inmates complained of the cold and 
isolation and were allowed few visits from relatives 
they ought to close the camp down wolf said its a 
terrible place and it ought not to exist 
perm 35 is known for housing soviet dissidents including noted 
human rights activist natan sharansky who now lives in israel 
smith said tuesday that perm 35 was notorious for 
mistreatment particularly of political prisoners 
wolf and smith said the camp clearly was spruced up for their 
arrival with fresh paint on many walls and flowers on cafeteria 
tables 
they also visited punishment cells where they were told 
prisoners were kept with no bedding or warm clothes even in the 
dead of winter 
former prisoners have said confinement at the camp about 1000 
miles east of moscow and 80 miles outside the industrial town of 
perm included everyotherday rations of bread and gruel and new 
punishments tacked onto their sentences 
the congressmen who are members of the helsinki commission 
said they would seek to have more delegations visit such camps to 
assure that conditions were humane 
smith said he hoped that bringing glasnost to the gulag or 
more openness to the prison camp system would bring improvements 
in camp life 
asked how he reconciled his findings with president mikhail s 
gorbachevs denials that the soviet union still has political 
prisoners smith said i believe mr gorbachev may have been 
misled by his own people 
human rights groups estimate about 100 political prisoners 
remain in the soviet union according to a state department 
official accompanying the congressmen 
we think mr gorbachev will use his immense political power to 
see these people are released smith said 
smith and wolf said they and several human rights groups are 
pushing soviet authorities to review the cases of the prisoners 
they met many were convicted of treason or for trying to illegally 
leave the soviet union 
the congressmen said they expected the soviets to clean up 
their own act before the helsinki conference on human rights 
convenes in moscow in 1991 
the two men went to perm on their own initiative after broaching 
the idea to a senior soviet justice official six months ago in the 
netherlands they were granted approval one day before the trip to 
perm was scheduled and made the visit on wednesday 
they said this week that they received official permission after 
meeting with interior minister vadim bakatin and the soviet unions 
chief prosecutor alexander sukharev 
smith said they wanted to expose some of the horror of a 
prison camp 
on tuesday in a telephone call from moscow to washington smith 
said frank wolf and i and the first two congressmen to go the 
the perm camp

medical experts have developed an antibiotic to 
combat severe cases of catscratch disease caused when a cat with 
infected claws scratches a person doctors say 
catscratch disease normally is a localized infection of the 
lymph glands that which goes away within a few weeks or months but 
about 12 percent of infected people experience prolonged illness 
which could result in damage to the liver or spleen dr clifford 
w bogue and three colleagues wrote in fridays journal of the 
american medical association 
in controlled tests with three severely infected children bogue 
and three colleagues found that gentamicin sulfate an antibiotic 
appeared to markedly improve their condition 
these cases suggest that gentamicin may be efficacious in 
shortening the course of catscratch disease the authors wrote 
the children a 10yearold and two 5yearold girls responded 
to the antibiotic within 48 hours the authors said they noted no 
recurrence of symptoms 
the disease was first noted in 1931 but doctors for years 
failed to associate the cause with cat scratches by 1967 there 
were more than 560 references to csd in medical literature 
scientists and doctors over the past 22 years have related other 
symptoms to the disease including fever abdominal pain atypical 
pneumonia and breast tumors

the bush administration said thursday there 
might eventually be direct usiran talks on the middle east 
hostages while officials encouraged an intermediarys role by 
pakistan in the meantime 
were willing to have direct talks with iran as long as they 
were authoritative officials who represented the government said 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater 
fitzwater suggested it was premature to expect such contacts at 
this point were nowhere near that he said 
still the spokesman said we would not be ruling out direct 
discussions at some future point 
the united states severed diplomatic ties with tehran in the 
aftermath of irans seizing of us embassy hostages a decade ago 
meanwhile thursday us officials welcomed reports that 
pakistani foreign minister sahabzada yaqub khan would go to tehran 
next week and be willing to serve as an intermediary in indirect 
talks between this nation and iran 
a senior administration official said pakistans role could be 
critical in persuading iran to pressure proiranian groups into 
releasing kidnapped americans and westerners held in lebanon 
pakistan is a moslem country with access and ties to other 
moslem countries and with special knowledge of irans 
involvement in the hostage situation said the official who 
declined to be identified 
a spokesman at the pakistan embassy said that since pakistan 
has good relations with both iran and the united states if asked 
pakistan would be willing to mediate in the hostage crisis the 
spokesman who said he could not be identified under his 
governments rules added he was unable to confirm or deny whether 
pakistan has already been an intermediary between iran and the 
united states 
the englishlanguage tehran times said in a report on thursday 
that indirect talks between iran and the united states on the 
hostage crisis would be undertaken through a third country 
probably pakistan 
fitzwater observed that some thirdcountry discussions already 
had taken place but added we are encouraging talks of every 
kind 
he said khan and other pakistani officials do have contacts in 
iran and it was the administrations policy to leave no stone 
unturned in seeking to win freedom of the us hostages 
of khans trip fitzwater said he could not supply details 
theres a lot of unknowns regarding his trip and his purposes 
khan made an unexpected visit to washington last week where he 
met on the hostage situation with vice president dan quayle 
according to quayle spokesman david beckwith 
vice president quayle urged pakistan to become involved in 
helping facilitate the release of the hostages and to reveal to 
iran information that pakistan has accumulated on the situation 
pakistan is one of the countries that were looking to for 
help beckwith added 
the tehran times said that indirect talks between iran and the 
united states on the hostages would begin within days the official 
islamic republic news agency reported 
the agency monitored in nicosia quoted the paper as saying 
political observers believed that in the next few days we should 
expect certain moves towards mediation of course unofficially 
at the state department margaret tutwiler noted that we 
already have indirect communications with the government of iran 
primarily through the swiss government 
on the possibility of direct contact she said the us 
government is prepared to engage in a dialogue with authorized 
representatives of the government of iran to discuss the issues 
that divide us 
however any improvement in relations with iran depends upon 
that governments stopping its support for terrorism and taking 
action to bring about the immediate unconditional and safe release 
of us citizens held hostage by iraniansupported groups in 
lebanon she added 
both fitzwater and ms tutwiler said that a willingness to talk 
directly with iran on issues dividing the two nations was not a new 
us policy 
for direct talks to take place he said we would want to be 
sure of the authoritative nature of our contacts we would want to 
have some clear understanding of what we wanted to say to them and 
of their interest in having those discussions 
i have not heard any interest from iran in having direct 
talks and that is a major factor as well fitzwater added 
bush himself made no comment on the hostage matter passing up 
an opportunity to discuss the situation during an appearance in the 
rose garden where he announced the selection of army gen colin 
powell as the next chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
meanwhile fitzwater told reporters the united states and israel 
were consulting with each other about efforts to free their 
hostages in lebanon but were not coordinating their efforts 
israeli officials had said israels prime minister yitzhak 
shamir persuaded bush in a 10minute telephone call wednesday to 
coordinate efforts to release foreign hostages and israeli 
prisoners held in lebanon 
weve generally tried to be forthcoming with what we are 
doing and they have been forthcoming with what theyre doing 
however i would not characterize it as coordination fitzwater 
said

us marines stormed ashore and a 
mechanized infantry battalion rumbled across the panama canal on 
thursday in a security exercise one day after a standoff between 
us and panamanian forces 
the exercise was the latest us show of force in and around 
fort amador a base for both us and panamanian forces and site of 
an office maintained by gen manuel antonio noriega 
the operation was designed to carry out certain functions in 
keeping with the mission of the us defense forces and the 
protection of the panama canal particularly testing troop 
readiness and deployment capability said col ronald sconyers 
reading a us southern command news release 
the purpose was also to reaffirm our treaty rights including 
the right of transit 
us officials have said they plan to vigorously enforce canal 
treaty rights including responsibility for canal security 
officials hope to show panamanians especially military officers 
who might oust noriega how helpless the general is in the face of 
us power 
noriega de facto leader of panama through his command of the 
panamanian defense forces has successfully resisted all us 
attempts to oust him since he was indicted on us drug trafficking 
charges in february 1988 
noriega denies the charges and says the us efforts to remove 
him are part of an effort to retain control of the canal which the 
united states has pledged to give to panama at the end of 1999 
us troops arrested but later released 29 panamanians on 
tuesday the next day panamanians arrested two us military 
policemen leading to a threehour us blockade at fort amador 
before the two were released 
transport ships armored personnel carriers and light amphibious 
vehicles took part in thursdays exercise with helicopters and 
fighterbombers providing cover 
a small group of panamanian soldiers stationed themselves about 
100 yards from the marine landing and small panamanian helicopters 
briefly flew overhead two panamanian military trucks were blocked 
for 10 minutes without further incident 
we are ensuring the security of the fort amador area in 
accordance with our treaty rights said sconyers 
he refused to say how many troops were involved but reporters 
could see at least 800 soldiers and marines 50 troop carriers 
four seaplanes landing craft and helicopters the troops took up 
combat positions in the grass around fort amador 
the exercises began when a battalion of the mechanized 5th 
infantry division left its base on the western side of the canal 
and crossed a bridge to fort amador while a light infantry company 
of marines landed at the end of the amador causeway south of the 
fort 
the panamanian defense forces were told thursday morning of the 
us plans they held exercises a few miles away 
in caracas venezuela col roberto diaz herrera the former 
chief of staff of the panamanian defense forces said on thursday 
that noriega was seeking a bloody clash with us units in panama 
as a desperate move to regain military strength and remain in full 
command of his country 
diaz herrera who has lived in venezuelan exile since 1987 
said noriega is like a cornered tiger striking blindly with its 
paws he needs a massacre of panamanian soldiers to arouse morale 
among his troops and present panama as a victim 
diaz herreras charges that noriega was deeply involved in drug 
trafficking and that presidential elections were rigged to favor 
the official candidates helped set off the continuing political 
turmoil in panama

an fbi agent who said he was defamed by a book 
describing the violence and killing of two other agents during the 
wounded knee occupation in south dakota is not entitled to damages 
an appellate court has ruled 
a threejudge panel of the 8th us circuit court of appeals on 
monday upheld a lower courts dismissal of claims by david price 
an fbi special agent assigned to the pine ridge reservation during 
the early 1970s 
price filed a 25 million lawsuit against peter matthiessen 
author of in the spirit of crazy horse and the books 
publisher viking penguin inc the company suspended circulation of 
the book pending the suits outcome 
the book dealt with a 1975 shootout at pine ridge reservation at 
wounded knee that left two fbi agents dead and got american indian 
movement activist leonard peltier two life prison terms 
price claimed the book accused him of becoming involved in 
perjury by a witness misconduct gross negligence in the murder of 
a woman thought to have been an fbi informant and withholding 
information 
the book presents the view of the aim that it was targeted for 
harrassment by the fbi matthiessen reviews the groups occupation 
of wounded knee in 1973 and subsequent prosecutions of aim leaders 
dennis banks and russell means 
according to the book price supervised louis moves camp a 
witness at their trial whose testimoney was later discredited 
fairly or not price had come to personify the most cynical 
abuses of the fbis regressive attitudes toward indians the 
author wrote in one passage referring to his interviewing the fbi 
agent 
the lawsuit accused the defendants of defamation intentional 
infliction of emotional distress invasion of privacy and other 
violations of his rights 
successive us district court rulings narrowed the suits scope 
to the defamation claims nearly four years after price first filed 
his suit and after the defendants incurred legal costs exceeding 1 
million the lower court dismissed remaining claims 
in its response on monday to prices appeal the 8th circuit 
court acknowledged its ruling was an anomaly in a time when 
court cases focus increasingly on whether there is injury the 
court said also that it searched diligently for fault and ignored 
some injury to the appellant 
but there is a larger injury to be considered the court 
wrote the damage done to every american when a book is pulled 
from a shelf as in this case or when an idea is not circulated 
the court noted that while price was praised for his work at 
wounded knee he also became involved in public controversies his 
complaint the court said took statements from their setting in a 
way that distorts the flavor of the book 
in its entirety crazy horse focuses more on public 
institutions and social forces than it does on any public 
official the opinion said 
the sentiments it expresses are debatable we favor letting 
the debate continue

a winged rocket built to 
be launched from under the wing of an airplane and carry small 
satellites into orbit at low cost was shown off thursday in advance 
of a flight test program 
the gleaming white 49footlong pegasus named after the 
mythological winged horse was rolled out of a hangar at nasas 
amesdryden flight research facility as 400 guests watched and a 
high school band played 
pegasus will not only open up new horizons in lowcost 
innovative uses of space but also confirms once more americas 
leadership in space technology said antonio elias chief 
engineer of the rocket project 
noting its adaptation of technology from military missiles 
elias declared pegasus a noteworthy example of swords turned into 
plowshares 
the threestage rocket was developed as a joint venture by 
orbital sciences corp and hercules aerospace co which estimate 
pegasus rockets can put satellites into space at a cost of 6 
million to 8 million per launch 
the rocket that was rolled out for the ceremony will be carried 
aloft under the wing of a nasa b52 for test flights later this 
month and in early october but wont be launched 
later in october another pegasus will be released from a b52 
about 40000 feet over the pacific ocean off the california coast 
the builders plan to buy or lease planes to launch future rockets 
bob lovell vice president of the space applications division at 
orbital sciences said the company is certain there is a market for 
the rocket 
we believe that well be launching one of these a month 
beginning in about 1991 and ultimately we hope to go as high as 
two a month that market we think will be split roughly equally 
between department of defense missions and commercial missions 
he said 
the military is interested because of the ability to launch 
pegasus quickly in reacting to such events as the grenada invasion 
said air force lt col ed nicastri from the defense advanced 
research projects agency 
if we wanted to get more communications into that area we 
could quickly launch communications satellites nicastri said a 
conventional launch would take about 30 days notice he said 
launch costs for military payloads average 120 million on a 
space shuttle about 100 million for a titan launch and some 40 
million for a deltaclass launch nicastri said 
however space shuttles titans and deltas can carry much bigger 
and heavier payloads than the pegasus 
the companies announced in june that their first commercial 
customer is ball corp under an agreement pegasus rockets will be 
used to launch two ball communications satellites in 1990 or 1991 
the nasa b52 will be used for the flight tests but the 
builders will lease or buy planes to launch future rockets for 
other clients

a judge in a backwoods amazon town 
said thursday that he indicted a cattle rancher his son and 
another man for the slaying of amazon union leader and 
environmentalist chico mendes 
judge adair jose longuini of the jungle town of xapuri 2660 
miles northwest of rio said he indicted darli alves da silva for 
ordering the dec 22 1988 killing of mendes 
silvas son darcy pereira da silva and gunman jerdeir pereira 
were indicted for carrying out the slaying longuini said 
mendes death caused an international outcry from human rights 
and environmental groups along with demands for the capture and 
prosecution of his killers 
he was just one of hundreds of union leaders and environmentists 
killed in disputes over land and development in the amazon 
rainforest but most of the cases have never been tried 
the indictments issued wednesday were sent to the state court 
in rio branco the capital of acre state he said 
under brazilian law a judge can indict someone who is accused 
of a crime and the court later upholds or dismisses the ruling 
the court should rule on my findings within 90 days if they 
confirm the indictments the trial will be held in xapuri he said 
longuini said both members of the da silva family were jailed in 
rio branco police are still looking for jerdeir pereira 
the elder da silva has denied any role in the shooting his son 
earlier said he was involved but has since said he had no role 
mendes 44 headed a local rubber tappers union in xapuri a 
small amazon town near the bolivian border union members often 
blocked ranchers efforts to clear rainforest by standing in front 
of bulldozers with family and community members 
in 1987 mendes received the united nations global 500 ecological 
award for his work in defense of the amazon 
the issue of how to develop the amazon jungle an expanse of 
rain forest about twothirds the size of the continental united 
states has often erupted in bloody clashes between landowners and 
politicians on one side and peasant farmers progressive clergymen 
and ecologists on the other

the man accused of the fatal shooting of 
actress rebecca schaeffer was hustled out of arizona by los angeles 
authorities thursday after his public defender filed the wrong 
motion in the wrong court 
district attorney ira reiner said his office seized the chance 
to snatch robert john bardo 19 from tucson after realizing 
that bardos defense lawyer had challenged to his extradition in 
the wrong court 
lori lefferts a pima county deputy public defender appointed to 
represent bardo in extradition proceedings said his transfer to 
los angeles was totally in violation of his rights he had an 
absolute right to a hearing and he never got that hearing 
however she said i have absolutely no remedy its all over 
for here 
she said she did not learn about the action until two hours 
after he left on a plane to los angeles 
the public defender apparently thought she had eight days to 
challenge extradition but reiner said she didnt have eight 
minutes 
this is not a game reiner said at a news conference this 
is murder and if we are able to move into tucson and snatch him 
we are going to do that 
because of a momentary lapse by his lawyer we were able to 
avoid the lengthy and in this case unnecessary delays of an 
extradition proceeding he said 
a governors warrant was served on bardo on monday a defense 
attorney can file petition for a writ of habeas corpus to fight the 
warrant 
but instead of filing for a writ which would have automatically 
held bardo until a hearing could be held ms lefferts filed a 
motion to stay the proceeding pending a mental health examination 
and filed it in justice court instead of superior court 
the judge denied her motion he refused to put a stay on the 
extradition and so los angeles was advised that they could pick 
bardo up said ricki macey head of the fugitive warrant unit in 
the pima county attorneys office 
ms lefferts still could have filed a petition for a writ in 
superior court but in the meantime two police investigators 
hurried to reach tucson wednesday before the court clerks office 
closed at midnight 
their flight was delayed four times but with an escort by 
tuscon police officers they made it in time to complete paperwork 
take custody of bardo and fly him back to los angeles on a 6 am 
flight 
reiner said the quick move averted a protracted legal battle 
over bardos mental competency 
miss schaeffer 21 who had costarred in the television series 
my sister sam was shot to death in los angeles on july 18 
bardo was arrested the next day in tucson after he ran in and 
out of traffic on interstate 10 near a downtown exit 
detectives said statements by bardo prompted them to notify los 
angeles authorities investigating miss schaeffers death 
bardo who lived at his parents tucson home collected 
videotapes of the series once was thrown out of a tv studio where 
miss schaeffer was working sent her a rambling love letter and had 
hired a detective agency to find her address officials have said 
bardo had been held in lieu of 1 million bond in the pima 
county jails mental health unit and had been under a suicide watch 
ms lefferts declined to say if bardo has undergone psychiatric 
evaluation 
bardo was scheduled to be arraigned on the murder charge in los 
angeles on friday

crews searching for the plane 
carrying us rep mickey leland and 13 companions were told a us 
weather satellite picked up two emergency signals one on thursday 
and one early friday 
the satellite was passing directly over ethiopia when it picked 
up the second signal far away from the first signal picked up 
thursday but still boosting confidence that it came from the 
missing plane 
the satellite read the second signal as coming at 1 am friday 
6 pm edt thursday from about 100 miles northnorthwest of addis 
ababa capital of ethiopia when the texas democrats plane 
vanished monday it was supposed to be going southwest directly 
opposite from where the new signal was detected 
we have greater confidence in this particular signal because 
the satellite was in a better position to make a location said 
russell koffler of the national oceanic atmospheric administration 
in washington 
the second signal was picked up on a different wavelength from 
the earlier one but koffler said the missing plane could broadcast 
on both wavelengths 
we are confident we got a good fix we have more confidence in 
this signal than in the one last night said koffler 
officials believe the first signal came from 84 miles southeast 
of addis ababa both signals were far from the flight path lelands 
plane would have taken to reach fugnido refugee camp for which 
leland chairman of the house select committee on hunger was 
headed 
the camp lies 480 miles southwest of addis ababa and near the 
sudanese border 
koffler said the second signal doesnt mean its from that 
particular plane but noted there would be few such sources for 
distress signals in ethiopia 
the first signal was picked up when the satellite passed over 
the edge of ethiopias border and search teams set out on foot for 
that remote mountain area 
both signals were relayed from the satellite to a ground station 
in india 
leland took off monday morning with eight americans and five 
ethiopians for the fugnido camp 
the twinengine twin otter aircraft was reported missing monday 
evening 
the satellite picked up the first faint distress signal at 342 
am thursday 842 pm edt wednesday 
it could have been another plane flying over the area and the 
pilot fingered his microphone and the satellite picked up the 
blip observed robert houdek charge daffairs at the us 
embassy in addis ababa 
james t baily manager of the administrations search and 
rescue satellite program said subsequent satellite passes could 
not confirm the signal because of radio interference 
lelands plane was equipped with an emergency locator 
transmitter a device usually mounted in the tail of an aircraft 
and activated either automatically by impact or manually 
two us air force c130 hercules cargo planes arrived thursday 
and spent three hours flying over the path lelands plane was 
supposed to have taken 
a u2 aircraft also joined the search u2s are capable of 
taking highresolution photographs over a broad area and were once 
commonly used for espionage missions 
four us army blackhawk helicopters were expected to arrive 
friday 
four ethiopian air force helicopters were also added joining 
the us fleet and more than a dozen light planes under the 
direction of the ethiopian civil aviation authority 
since monday the search has centered on a high mountainous 
plateau near the sudanese border not far from the fugnido camp 
there were reports on monday that peasants heard a light plane 
circling one or two dirt landing strips in an area 50 miles from 
lelands destination 
the feeling is that the reports that we heard of a plane being 
heard in that area mean that the pilot may have made a successful 
emergency landing said john guerra of the us embassy 
the possibility is that the congressmans plane got past the 
most treacherous terrain and theyre just sitting someplace waiting 
to be found he said the group had some water and food but not 
much in addition temperatures in the area can drop to freezing at 
night 
on board besides leland were three members of his staff a 
friend four americans from the us embassy and the us agency 
for international development and five ethiopians including three 
government officials the pilot and copilot 
two congressional colleagues reps gary ackerman and alan 
wheat flew to addis ababa to take part in the search

soviet farmers will soon be able to cash in on 
their cash crops under a new decree that allows them to sell 
surplus grain and seeds for hard currency the official tass news 
agency reported thursday 
the resolution says farmers can sell part of their highquality 
wheat peas lupine and oilbearing seeds to the government for 
convertible currency that can be used to buy hardtoget foreign 
goods 
the reasoning is that the chance to earn hard currency will 
stimulate so much extra production that the state will end up 
paying its own farmers less than it would have paid for imports to 
make up chronic shortages tass said 
tass said the new system will be introduced on a test basis in 
198990 
economist nikolai shemelev suggested at the congress of peoples 
deputies in june that the soviet union adopt such a system 
tass said the state will pay 96 in hard currency per ton of 
strong and durum wheat 64 per ton of other highquality wheat 
128 per ton of pea and lupine and 144 per ton of sunflower soy 
rape flax and mustard seed 
the farms will be free in spending the currency tass said 
soviet citizens access to foreign currency is normally very 
restricted but restrictions have begun to loosen slightly as more 
soviet firms are allowed access to foreign markets under president 
mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
the ability to buy foreign goods takes on added significance in 
the face of shortages of such basics as soap detergent and 
medicine due to economic dislocation brought on by reforms 
the government will also look into the possibility of allowing 
individual farmers with private plots and those who lease their 
land to sell for hard currency as well tass said 
its report said the new resolution was passed in accordance with 
a decision of the congress of peoples deputies

east germany has pledged not to punish 
hundreds of its citizens who have gone underground in hungary or 
are seeking asylum on west german diplomatic property hungarian 
officials said thursday 
the interior ministry officials also said hungary was examining 
about 10 petitions for political asylum but that none of them were 
from east germans 
we have been authorized to announce by east germany that 
those east german citizens now at the west german embassy as well 
as those east german citizens residing here illegally will not be 
subject to punitive measures if they return to east germany within 
a short time said police col karoly nagy told reporters they 
can then submit their emigration petitions 
a west german embassy official said he believed the east german 
offer was good only for those in hungary 
those in the east berlin mission had been promised freedom from 
prosecution but not permission to submit emigration requests he 
said the west german who attended the news conference asked that 
he not be named 
east germans began occupying west german diplomatic legations in 
eastern europe nearly two weeks ago apparently out of frustration 
over the lack of reform in their communist country and the 
difficulty of emigrating through official channels 
as many as 400 are reported holed up in embassies and consulates 
in budapest and prague and at the permanent mission in east 
berlin an undetermined number is said to have gone underground in 
hungary fearing persecution if they return because of their escape 
attempts 
east german media said thursday that 158 east germans were on 
west german diplomatic property in hungary 
hungarian officials speaking privately have conceded that the 
standoff is leading to tensions with warsaw pact ally east germany 
which has attacked reforms under way in hungary 
hungary is the only soviet bloc nation to have joined the un 
convention on the rights of refugees and nagy said the petititons 
of the approximately 10 asylumseekers were being examined in the 
spirit of the convention although new hungarian refugee laws were 
not yet complete 
hungary first joined the convention stipulating the right to 
asylum for those persecuted because of race religion nationality 
or political beliefs in march 
in a statement distributed at the news conference the interior 
ministry said that despite hungarys acceptance of the convention 
our nation does not wish to become an exiting channel for 
east european citizens 
the officials acknowledged that ethnic hungarians and romanians 
who flee to hungary are being permitted to stay without 
formalities although a similar bilateral agreement exists with 
bucharest they said such unequal treatment will end by october 
when each case will be examined on its merits regardless of the 
applicants citizenship 
formally soviet bloc allies romania and hungary are deeply 
split over territorial and ethnic disagreements

former philippine first lady imelda marcos 
pleaded thursday to leave the united states but promised to return 
to face prosecution on criminal racketeering charges if it is the 
last thing i do 
your honor i would like to make a plea and a pledge a plea 
to bring president marcos home to his motherland the 
philippines she said sobbing 
if it is the last thing i will do in my life i will come back 
to new york to vindicate our name the name of the marcoses 
for the truth will set us free she told chief us immigration 
judge william r robie 
mrs marcos 60 is challenging a travel ban imposed in june by 
the immigration and naturalization service which bars her from 
leaving the united states robie is expected to issue his ruling in 
washington in several weeks 
mrs marcos wants to take her dying husband ferdinand the 
former philippine president back to their homeland but more than 
the ins order is preventing their departure 
the marcoses were indicted by the united states last october for 
allegedly stealing more than 100 million from the philippines and 
stashing it in the united states marcos was separated from the 
case because of his failing health but mrs marcos pleaded 
innocent and was released on 5 million bail 
her bail provisions require her to stay in the country and 
marcos attorney richard hibey said that makes the travel order 
unnecessary 
besides hibey said philippine president corazon aquino has 
forbidden marcos return dead or alive and the ban extends to his 
family the 71yearold marcos has been hospitalized here for the 
past seven months and was listed in critical condition thursday 
mrs marcos has repeatedly said she would like to bring her 
husband home to die and has appealed to mrs aquino to allow her 
wish 
hibey said he would ask a federal judge to expand mrs marcos 
bail provisions to allow her to leave only if marcos dies mrs 
aquino relents and the ins order was lifted 
im dealing with the legal realities shes dealing with what 
she really wants hibey said 
the government contends the travel ban should stand because the 
marcoses are billionaires and the loss of 5 million would not 
prevent mrs marcos from fleeing that they unsuccessfully plotted 
to overthrow mrs aquino that their presence in the philippines 
would destabilize the government and that no extradition treaty 
exists between the two countries to ensure mrs marcos return 
roy hendricks acting district director of the ins in honolulu 
testified thursday that he had no specific reason to believe 
mrs marcos would flee and that he issued the travel ban on orders 
from washington

the agriculture department on thursday 
estimated soviet grain production this year at 200 million metric 
tons 10 million below earlier forecasts and said there would be a 
resulting rise in imports 
the department estimated grain imports by the soviets in the 
year that began july 1 at 36 million tons 3 million above previous 
estimates 
hot and dry weather across many of the spring wheatgrowing 
regions of the soviet union combined with a shrinkage in the 
growing area are causing the drop according to a report from the 
foreign agriculture service 
it estimated wheat production down 45 million tons to 87 
million while coarse grains decreased by 55 million to 100 
million 
over the last 14 years soviet grain production fell to its 
lowest level 1401 million metric tons in 1975 and climbed to its 
high of 2374 million in 1978 grain production reached 2114 
million in 1987 and 1951 million last year 
this year favorable conditions across much of the european 
portion of the soviet union have failed to fully offset hot and dry 
weather baking out soil moisture from the eastern urals to western 
sibera usda said it said cooler weather and showers in the last 
week came too late to rescue spring grains

the pentecostal denomination that endured 
the jimmy swaggart and jim bakker scandals has rewritten its rules 
of conduct for ministers to include sexual misconduct as a 
punishable offense 
the assemblies of god said the more specific wording was part of 
a rule revision that had been planned for six years delegates 
approved the change wednesday at the denominations general council 
meeting 
previously any offenses involving sexual misconduct fell under 
the general statement of any conduct unbecoming to a minister or 
indiscretions involving morals 
swaggart was expelled in 1988 for refusing to accept a oneyear 
suspension after his tearful confession of moral failure he 
had been accused of patronizing a prostitute 
bakker founder of the ptl ministry was stripped of his 
credentials in 1987 after admitting a sexual encounter with church 
secretary jessica hahn 
other causes for disciplinary action are dictatorial 
authority over a congregation inefficiency a noncooperative 
spirit a habit of running into debt and the remarriage of a 
divorced clergy member whose former spouse is still living 
a credentials committee will decide whether a minister is 
rehabilitated or dismissed for an offense based on the manner and 
thoroughness of repentance the attitude of the minister toward the 
discipline and willingness to cooperate

parts of the south midwest and northeast are 
expected to have a worse hay fever season this year beginning in 
about two weeks according to the american academy of allergy and 
immunology 
a good growing season that began with a wet spring means new 
york pennsylvania and new jersey could experience the worst 
increase in allergic reactions to the pollen of ragweed and other 
plants said sarah kaluzny communications manager for the academy 
based in milwaukee 
other states predicted to be bad this year are montana alaska 
nevada north dakota oklahoma alabama georgia texas indiana 
and kentucky she said 
doctors from most of the 50 states responded to an unscientific 
survey by the academy and none indicated this year would see an 
improvement over last year ms kaluzny said no responses came 
from arkansas colorado nebraska kansas illinios ohio utah 
new hampshire massachusettes connecticut maryland florida 
north carolina and idaho 
ragweed is the major cause of allergies with each plant 
producing a million grains of pollen ms kaluzny said 
mold counts also are up in some areas of the nation because of

a bicoastal feud between two militant jewish 
organizations erupted in violence in greenwich village on thursday 
when the head of one faction fired shots at the leader of another 
injuring a bystander 
mordechai levy head of the jewish defense organization 
surrendered to police nearly 2 hours after the shots were fired 
following a dispute about court papers that were served in a libel 
suit 
authorities said levy would be charged with three counts of 
attempted murder 
the victim dominick spinelli was listed in stable condition at 
st vincents hospital he was sitting in a van on near levys 
apartment when a shot came through the windshield and hit him in 
the knee at about 1225 pm 
levys apparent target was irwin rubin the los angelesbased 
head of the jewish defense league who went with private 
investigator steve rombom to levys bleecker street home to serve 
him with papers in a libel action rubin had filed 
at issue were comments levy made in an interview with a west 
coast radio station the two groups the jdl and jdo have been 
contentious for years as rubin and levy battle over the mantle of 
the jdls founder meir kahane 
levy left the jdl about 7 or 8 years ago he formed his 
own organization the jdo and theyve been at odds with the jdl 
since then said lt david nadel a police liaison with the 
jewish community

rescue teams searching along the san 
rafael river on thursday found bodies as far as 14 miles downstream 
from the site of a rail disaster that killed at least 112 people 
the number of injured reached 205 the government news agency 
quoted state security coordinator jose carlos saracho as saying 
but hospital officials said most victims were treated for minor 
injuries and released 
survivors said they fought for life after the 11car train 
carrying about 360 people plunged off a bridge at 4 am wednesday 
morning and fell 25 feet into churning flood waters 
i had my little girl since the car was full and the current 
came we hit the roof and i could hear her drowning and you could 
hear that the other people were drowning too we were drowning and 
the windows were closed said miriam partida santos 17 
a pregnant woman grabbed me and that was when my girl got 
away i dont know how i escaped at some point i got up to the top 
and got air said mrs santos who was in the social security 
hospital in guasave 
she and other survivors said the train had been late departing 
and passengers were told that another train had derailed along the 
line to the north many passengers were asleep on the floor because 
there were no seats 
the federal transportation department said the train plunged off 
the bridge following torrential rains the train was bound from the 
pacific coastal resort of mazatlan to mexicali on the california 
border 
a department statement said the area experienced its worst 
rainstorm in the last 50 years just before the crash it said two 
inches of rain in six hours caused a dam to overflow and the 
resulting torrent washed out supports for the bridge which 
collapsed under the trains weight 
before i realized what happened it had already crashed 
said one train victim interviewed on television his nose was 
bandaged but he was otherwise unhurt 
hundreds of workers from nearby towns showed up to help said 
officials in guasave near the crash site 730 miles northwest of 
mexico city 
helicopters flew in rescue workers and railroad handcars 
trundled out casualties flooding closed roads 
the train popularly known as the burro because it stops at 
almost every station along the 900mile route is patronized almost 
entirely by poor mexicans it left mazatlan at 745 pm tuesday 
and had gone about 250 miles when the accident occurred at about 4 
am police said they did not know how fast the train was going at 
the time 
javier lopez the red cross duty officer in los mochis 60 miles 
northeast of the crash site said most of those on the train had 
apparently been sleeping and that most of the victims drowned 
no americans have been reported among the dead said dan sainz 
the us vice consul in mazatlan but he said bodies were still 
being found 
mrs santos who had been traveling back to her home in the 
northern state of sonora after visiting inlaws said she had 
spoken to a young american woman who was riding in her car she 
said she did not know the womans fate 
most bodies were still unidentified all those identified so far 
were mexicans 
passenger cars lay strewn across the track others lay on their 
side in the river 
sinaloa state gov francisco labastida ochoa said thursday that 
national railroads was providing food clothing shelter and about 
200 each for survivors 
heavy rains have soaked the state for two weeks rain resumed 
during the night and the search was suspended but the skies 
cleared thursday morning and police firefighters and red cross 
workers returned to the site 
lt gabriela herrera a duty officer with guasave police said 
about 20 bodies were in the towns three funeral parlors and the 
rest were at guamuchil and los mochis 
at least three foreigners survived the wreck said teresita 
rubio at turismo tagore in guasave she said two men and a woman 
from manchester england came to the travel agency for help 
washed the mud off their clothes got some food and headed for san 
diego by bus 
many reports referred to people missing but many survivors 
apparently simply walked away and left the area or went home 
accidents are frequent on the rundown mexican railway but this 
was by far the worst this decade a rail spokesman like others 
consulted said it was not the worst in mexican railroad history 
but could not list a more serious one

seven frozen embryos at issue in an 
unprecedented divorce trial should be in their mothers womb in 
their normal shelter not in the fridge a doctor testified 
thursday 
jerome lejeune director of research at the french national 
center of scientific research testified in the divorce trial of 
junior lewis davis and mary sue davis 
the trial concluded thursday after three days judge w dale 
young said he would rule sometime within 30 days 
davis sued for divorce in february and raised an issue without 
legal precedent in this country by asking the court to prevent any 
use of the fertilized eggs without his consent mrs davis has had 
five tubal pregnancies and wanted embryos fertilized in a 
laboratory implanted directly in her womb 
lejeune who discovered the genetic cause of downs syndrome in 
1959 said storing the embryos at 180 degrees below zero centigrade 
slows the movement of their molecules in effect stopping the flow 
of time for them 
putting tiny human beings in a very cold space deprived of 
liberty deprived even of time they are suspended as it were in a 
concentration camp he said it is not as hospitable a place as 
the secret temple of a womans womb 
lejeune said he traveled to maryville at his own expense to 
testify because he heard mrs davis wanted to rescue these early 
human beings from that concentration camp and offer then the 
hospitality the shelter of her body 
davis testified thursday he does not want the embryos destroyed 
only that he consent to their use he has said the embryos should 
be considered property to be administered jointly by him and mrs 
davis 
jay christenberry mrs davis attorney said in closing 
arguments that in the absence of legal precedent the judge should 
look to the past 
we have to look at history when a mother wants to bear her 
children shes never been told no it seems to me a woman who 
now has the right to abort her fetus should have an even greater 
right to protect the unborn and bear her child or children 
in his closing argument charles clifford the attorney for 
junior davis said his clients right not to become a father is 
equal to mrs davis right to become a mother 
whatever the court decides will cause pain he said but 
if you weigh what is fundamentally fair the court must come down 
on the side of junior davis if the court places the burden of 
parenthood on him he will live with it forever 
clifford argued that mrs davis has a reasonable chance of 
becoming a mother even if she is not given control of the couples 
seven frozen embryos 
the embryos had been fertilized for less than two days and 
developed to less than eight cells each when they were frozen 
earlier witnesses said the cells at that stage are identical and 
do not begin to take on differing characteristics for 12 to 14 days 
after fertilization 
mrs davis testified thursday she considers the embryos life 
i am the mother of these embryos she said they are the 
beginning of life they are more than just cells that mean 
nothing 
she said leaving the embryos in cold storage as her estranged 
husband proposes would be killing them 
davis testified that he does not consider the cells as life he 
said he opposes abortion but notes these embryos are not inside 
any womans body

lech walesas bid for a government 
coalition without the communist party gained ground thursday as 
solidarity lawmakers discussed the proposal with the two small 
parties that hold the balance of power in parliament 
competition between solidarity and the communist polish united 
workers party for the support of the two smaller parties which 
each side needs to form a coalition has produced a government 
crisis once unimaginable in postwar poland 
in italy two visiting solidarity leaders said reformist 
communists could be allowed in a solidarityled government 
suggesting a possible way out of the impasse 
the only government that can appear credible in the eyes of 
the polish people is an executive headed by solidarity in coalition 
with all the reformist forces in the country including communist 
reformers adam michnik one of walesas closest strategists told 
the italian television network rai thursday 
solidarity parliamentary leader bronislaw geremek told rai that 
solidarity felt forced by polands economic crisis especially 
sharp increases in food prices aug 1 to accelerate its timetable 
for entering into power 
michnik and geremek who were in italy to be received by 
polishborn pope john paul ii said the key factor was for 
solidarity to head the next government 
aleksander bentkowski peasant party parliamentary leader held 
a hastily called meeting in waraw with newly elected communist 
prime minister czeslaw kiszczak a government spokesman said the 
state news agency pap gave no details in a report on the meeting 
the peasant party took the decision to support gen kiszczak 
too hastily and now our electors blame us for that bentkowski 
later told pap he said that had to be relayed to kiszczak and the 
peasant party leadership 
for his part kiszczak the former interior minister said he 
was open to all proposals from the peasant party and declared his 
readiness for cooperation 
communist party floor leader marian orzechowski told his caucus 
he had presented to kiszczak the need for new faces in the 
government pap reported 
peasant party deputies expressed opposition to kiszczak during a 
stormy caucus wednesday night the group took no official stand on 
the future government at a meeting thursday and more debate is 
planned next week 
a handful of peasant party lawmakers led by bentkowski 
received leading solidarity lawmakers thursday at peasant party 
headquarters walesa delegated sen jaroslaw kaczynski of elblag as 
his envoy 
the closed meeting had been proposed as a preliminary exchange 
of views on the possible shape of a solidaritypeasant coalition 
were at the beginning of the beginning kaczynski said 
before the meeting he said afterward the talks would continue 
kaczynski also met with tadeusz rymszewicz a leader of the 
democratic party a smaller party that also has expressed interest 
in a noncommunist coalition pap said they discussed walesas 
proposal 
although kiszczak is trying to assemble a cabinet to present to 
the sejm on aug 23 or aug 24 solidarity parliamentary leader 
bronislaw geremek said his caucus would seek a coaltion with the 
peasants and democrats before then 
the solidarity trade union has increased pressure on authorities 
by urging union members nationwide to plan protest actions 
against government economic and political policies 
with solidaritys 161 parliamentary seats and the peasants 76 
a solidaritypeasant alliance would have a bare working majority of 
237 votes in the 460member parliament but they would have a firm 
majority if joined by the 27member democratcs 
the possiblity of a noncommunist coalition has prompted 
expressions of alarm among communist authorities 
the politburo said tuesday such a coalition could threaten 
stability 
the communist coalition was guaranteed 65 percent of the sejm 
seats and solidarity allowed to contest only 35 percent under the 
agreement that set forth the conditions for polands freest vote in 
40 years in june 
but the communist party became a minority party in the sejm for 
the first time holding only 173 seats and thus depending on its 
previously obedient allies for a majority solidarity won all 161 
of the seats it was allowed to contest 
peasant and democratic legislators used to owe their seats to 
communistled nominating boards but this time were elected in 
competitive voting 
the communist alliance elected kiszczak prime minister over 
solidaritys objection aug 2 but now shows signs of crumbling 
after walesa proposed the solidaritypeasantdemocrat alliance 
the communist alliance is being strained by the negative 
reaction to kiszczaks election and growing anger over sharply 
increasing food prices and the lack of consumer goods

federal investigators thursday examined the 
battered tail engine of a northwest airlines dc10 that made an 
emergency landing after the engine broke up 
none of the 256 people aboard was injured a piece of the 
engines tail cone was missing and there were numerous small holes 
in the engine cover said joseph nall a member of the national 
transportation safety board 
the initial look at the aircraft shows relatively minor 
external damage to the no 2 engine nall said after 
investigators inspected the plane in a hangar at stapleton 
international airport 
nall said a fuel cutoff line also was severed when the engine 
broke apart in flight but crew members used a backup system to 
shut down the engine shortly before making an emergency landing 
wednesday at stapleton 
nall said the flight and data recorders of the dc10 were taken 
to washington dc where inspection showed that only the last 30 
minutes of the emergency were recorded and the engine failure 
itself apparently was erased 
stapleton spokesman richard boulware who saw the damaged 
engine said one of the holes was big enough i could have stuck 
my hand through 
boulware said he also saw broken turbine fan blades inside the 
engine 
officials declined to compare wednesdays incident with the 
general electric tailengine failure that preceded last months 
crash of a united airlines dc10 in sioux city iowa that killed 
111 people 
we are looking at this incident on its own on its merit 
nall said all were doing at this point is looking at this 
accident this dc10 this pratt amp whitney engine were not 
looking at dc10s 
flight 308 was en route from los angeles to minneapolis when the 
engine began breaking up the crew reported a loss of oil pressure 
and severe vibration in the tail engine and shut it down said greg 
feith an ntsb spokesman in denver 
the plane landed safely in denver a half hour later at about 
630 pm 
investigators from the ntsb the federal aviation administration 
and northwest examined the plane nall said ntsb investigators 
expected to interview crew members within the next week 
feith said accidents that do not involve fatalities or extensive 
damage to aircraft usually are investigated by regional offices 
but the northwest failure was too much of a coincidence 
following the sioux city crash 
the no 2 engine one of three on the jet is mounted in the 
aircrafts vertical stabilizer just above the tail wing on 
uniteds flight 232 the no 2 engine disintegrated shooting 
shrapnel that apparently severed hydraulic lines used to control 
the jet the investigation into the cause of that crash is 
continuing 
in washington faa chief james b busey said agency officials 
know of no hard facts that would lead us to take action to ground 
dc10s 
busey said there is insufficient information yet to link the 
incident with the iowa crash and said the dc10 is safe to fly 
i would fly in the aircraft today 
he called it a comfortable goodperforming airliner 
busey said the northwest incident was an example of the way 
the system should work because the pilots quickly shut down the 
engine diverted to a nearby airport and landed safely with no 
injuries

former finance minister hernan buchi on 
thursday became the lone government candidate in the race to 
succeed military president augusto pinochet after a veteran 
politician withdrew from the race 
voters on dec 14 will pick a succeessor to pinochet who took 
power in a bloody military coup in 1973 
buchi considered pinochets candidate was credited for much 
of chiles economic recovery boosting exports and presiding over a 
decline in inflation and the nations foreign debt 
but the opposition united around the christian democratic 
partys patricio aylwin is expected to win the vote the 
coalition of 17 parties ranging from left to centerright has 
promised its economic policies will emphasize aid to the nations 
growing number of poor 
the new government is to take office on march 11 1990 it will 
be the first presidential election since chileans chose salvador 
allende an avowed marxist in 1970 
sergio jarpa president of national renewal the nations 
largest conservative party said his party would formally endorse 
buchi 
buchi 40 called jarpas decision to step aside a show of 
patriotism jarpas announcement ended long and often difficult 
negotiations among pinochets supporters who hoped to face the 
election with a single candidate 
pinochet was obliged to call the election after losing an 
october referendum in which voters rejected a proposal to extend 
his rule until 1997 
the 73yearold president and army commander is barred by the 
constitution from seeking reelection he has said however he 
will retain his position as army commander in the next 
administration 
as finance minister from 1985 through april buchi led economic 
policies that won substantial praise from bankers at home and 
abroad 
inflation has fallen to 15 percent annually a modest figure by 
latin american standards buchi also encouraged exports which 
boomed to 7 billion last year leaving a surplus of 2 billion 
the nations foreign debt was cut from 21 billion three years 
ago to 165 billion today 
even so opinion polls give the 70yearold aylwin a substantial 
advantage over buchi a poll released thursday by the center for 
contemporary studies a respected private research institution 
gives aylwin the support of 538 percent of those polled to buchis 
238 percent

a weather satellite passing directly over 
ethiopia picked up a second emergency distress signal thursday far 
away from an earlier signal but still boosting cnfidence that it 
came from the plane of missing rep mickey leland officials said 
the satellite that picked up the second signal passed directly 
over ethiopia and read the signal as coming from about 100 miles 
northnorthwest of addis ababa lelands plane was supposed to be 
going southwest far from where the new signal was detected 
we have greater confidence in this particular signal because 
the satellite was in a better position to make a location said 
russell koffler of the national oceanic atmospheric administration 
the newest signal was picked up about 6 pm edt on a different 
wavelength from the signal the satellite detected wednesday night 
washington time 
koffler said the plane leland dtexas was flying in has the 
capability to broadcast on both the wavelengths that have been 
picked up 
the newest signal comes from far from the earlier signal 
however which officials believe was southwest of addis ababa both 
signals have been far from the flight path lelands plane would 
have taken to reach the refugee camps near the sudanese border he 
was headed for when his plane was reported missing on monday 
we are confident we got a good fix we have more confidence in 
this signal than in the one last night said koffler 
it doesnt mean its from that particular plane he 
cautioned adding there would be few such sources for distress 
signals in the thinly populated african nation however 
koffler said the clarity of the latest signal the knowledge 
that lelands plane could transmit signals on both wavelengths that 
have been detected and the rarity of other distress signals 
increased belief that the new signal came from lelands plane 
ethiopia was at the edge of the area covered by the satellite 
when it picked up the earlier signal search teams have headed on 
foot for the remote mountain area where the earlier signal was 
believed to originate and searchers hoped to send planes to that 
region at fridays daybreak in ethiopia 
like the earlier signal the new signal was relayed from the 
satellite to a ground station in india 
wed normally have confidence within a 20mile radius with 
that signal but it is still fairly marginal because of the 
distance the signal was relayed said koffler

the government declared a lima province under 
a 30day state of emergency thursday suspending civil rights and 
granting broad powers to the military to fight leftist insurgents 
with the addition of huarochiri which starts 30 miles east of 
limas city limits and has 60000 inhabitants eight departments 
and three provinces are under emergency restrictions 
in peru a department is the largest political subdivision and 
is divided into provinces 
the emergency restrictions cover onethird of peru and affect 
more than half of its 21 million residents 
the government has used state of emergency decrees to combat the 
guerrillas since 1982 among the restrictions implied in the decree 
are suspension of the rights of free movement and guarantees 
against search and seizure 
according to the official government newspaper el peruano the 
measures were applied to huarochiri because of its strategic 
importance as a mining center 
two rebel groups the maoist shining path and the procuba tupac 
amaru revolutionary movement are known to operate in the area the 
groups target the mines to steal dynamite and to damage the mining 
industry which provides peru with more than half its foreign 
export earnings 
the shining path began its armed insurgency against perus 
elected government in 1980 near the highland city of ayacucho 235 
miles southeast of lima it now operates throughout the andean 
highlands in some coastal areas and in the cocaproducing jungles 
of the northeast 
the smaller tupac amaru rebels who take their name from an 18th 
century mestizo revolutionary who fought to free peru from colonial 
spanish rule operate separately and in competition with the 
shining path 
the tupac amaru guerrillas took up arms in 1984 and have mostly 
engaged in urban attacks against government and commercial targets 
however in the last two years they have expanded into the 
highlands and jungle areas 
the government says more than 15000 people have died in the 
violence

known mrs mofford was in the area and had no intention of 
threatening anyone said sgt allan schmidt chief spokesman at the 
state department of public safety 
there are no charges he said none will be filed 
mrs mofford praised the officers for protecting her and said 
she hadnt seen the incident i really didnt know what was 
happening she said adding that she wasnt scared 
herands home telephone was not answered and an office that has 
taken messages for him in the past said it had no way of contacting 
him 
schmidt said florence police chief tom rankin and three state 
officers spotted herand near his car with a gun just as mrs 
mofford and her top aides were preparing to leave a restaurant 
after a task force meeting on state prisons

general agreement by schmidt mofford press secretary vada manager 
and several eyewitnesses that mrs mofford stayed in the restaurant 
while officers took herand in custody and grabbed the weapon 
i stepped back and pulled the governor said state land 
commissioner m jean hassell she was very very calm and very

she did not know of it as it was occurring schmidt said 
herand a former assistant pinal county attorney who now lives 
in glendale did not resist 
he later explained to officers that he had the gun on his 
dashboard because of a law requiring that weapons in cars be in 
full view and had taken it from the vehicle to protect it from the 
heat of the sun schmidt said he said officers found no evidence 
that the gun had ever been used 
the police officers reacted appropriately because you have to 
presume the worst schmidt added you dont ask you just do 
a local state officer grabbed herands gun while rankin turned 
him around schmidt said another state officer handcuffed the man 
mrs mofford a democrat was elected as secretary of state in

the main namibian rebel group said 
thursday that south africa will run 150000 south african voters 
and angolan guerrillas into namibia to rig novembers election 
with the connivance of un officials 
the angolan guerrillas members of the national union for the 
total independence of angola have has fought the marxist 
government of angola with south african aid since losing out in a 
civil war after independence from portugal in 1975 
hinyangerwa asheeke the un observer for nambias south west 
africa peoples organization or swapo suggested that the rebel 
movement would not recognize the results of an election that is not 
free and fair 
african nations asked the security council to meet urgently 
monday on the deteriorating situation in namibia ghanaian 
ambassador jv gbeho made the request in a letter to the councils 
president 
besides the situation asheeke complained about the nations are 
upset over the presence of former members of the counterinsurgency 
patrol koevoet in the territorys police they are also worried 
about election registration procedures that would enable 
authorities to record how individuals voted and a cumbersome 
votecounting process 
a spokesman for south africas un mission aubrey k dwyer 
replied that south africans are eligible to vote under 
unapproved election laws for namibia and that un election 
monitors would prevent ineligible voters such as the angolan 
guerrillas from perpetrating vote fraud 
swapo fought a guerrilla war from 1966 against south africas 
rule in namibia but it accepted a ceasefire it is the largest 
namibian political party 
asheeke said a loophole in namibias election law allows up to 
100000 south africans who worked in namibia for four years or more 
to register to vote 
he said an additional 50000 angolan rebels will be fraudulently 
registered to vote in namibia a land of 13 million people 
south african officials have estimated from 500000 to 600000 
people will register to vote 
an influx of antiswapo voters could deny the marxist party a 
twothirds majority in the election for a constituent assembly 
forcing it to form a coalition government that would be more 
cooperative with south africa 
asheeke said pretoria proceeded with enacting this election 
law obviously with the connivance of the special representative of 
the united nations in namibia martti ahtisaari 
as un special representative for namibia ahtisaari must 
approve the election laws and could suspend the election if he 
believes the process is not free and fair he has not suggested he 
will do that 
on april 1 un peacekeepers and administrators began 
implementing a oneyear plan to oversee the transition to 
independence 
south africa has ruled namibia since world war i 
south africa signed accords with angola and cuba in december 
agreeing to free namibia if 50000 cuban troops stationed in angola 
are sent home by mid1991 
in windhoek namibia relatives said thursday that 79 namibians 
held prisoner by swapo have returned home in the past two weeks 
but more than 1000 remain jailed in southern angola 
the parents committee of namibia whose family members were 
detained by swapo said the 79 came back unexpectedly along with 
refugees returning in the big un repatriation campaign

babies conceived in laboratories with the 
hightech help of fertility experts are just as likely to be normal 
as babies made by amateurs in the traditional way researchers say 
the study was conducted to determine if infants conceived by in 
vitro fertilization the socalled testtube babies are more apt 
to develop physical or mental abnormalities than other children 
said dr james l mills a national institute of child health and 
human development researcher 
the original question was are these children going to be 
developmentally delayed the answer to that is very clearly not 
mills said wednesday in a telephone interview they did extremely 
well 
in a study published this month in the journal of pediatrics 
mills and a team of scientists from eastern virginia medical school 
compared the development of 83 children born as a result of in 
vitro fertilization or ivf with 93 children born from normal 
conception the children were matched by age sex race age of the 
mother and other factors they were all between 12 months and 30 
months old

a pond in brooklyns prospect park is a quiet 
spot rimmed by tall oaks and a meadow but early each morning it 
goes to the dogs 
dogs by the hundreds are unleashed around it many running 
around a field before taking an early morning dip before 8 am 
park police dont enforce the leash law and the dogs dont waste 
the precious time 
all i have to do is say the word park and they are out the 
door said allen koppelman owner of a greyhound and a russian 
wolfhound 
the morning romps in the park are just one sign of the largely 
unnoticed other society living in new york an estimated 
600000 dogs 
their owners form social groups such as the prospect park dog amp 
breakfast club they hire dog walkers form dog play groups 
frequent canine clothing shops 
when they meet they discuss the peculiar trials of keeping a 
pooch in the city from pooperscooper vigilantes to landlords who 
wont let anything with four legs in the door 
its a whole other society in this city said joan 
chrysikopoulos 30 who owns two miniature poodles people buy 
dogs coats hats have sweaters knit for them 
dogs are big business with several specialty shops in the upper 
east side selling items costing hundreds of dollars 
if they can afford to buy dogs for 1500 they can afford to 
take care of them said karen thompson owner of karens for 
people and pets a pet accessory and dog grooming shop 
chrysikopolous believes theres another reason for spoiling 
dogs the guilt factor is tremendous you know your dog cant go 
outdoors when he wants to i worry that they are so bored 
she has bought her dogs sweaters and raincoats if its below 
50 its definitely a sweater they live in an apartment all day 
and arent used to the cold 
the raincoats may be more for show i would never have put a 
raincoat on a dog if we lived in the suburbs here theres more 
peer pressure chrysikopolous said 
the biggest issue for dog owners though is finding space for 
their pets to run last fall park police began enforcing the leash 
law after many years of not doing so writing 50 tickets to 
violators 
the reaction was swift dog groups formed including 
chrysikopoulos carl schurtz park dog owners group and they 
protested to park officials proleash groups formed to fight back 
william f dalton chief of citywide services for the parks 
department surprised by the intense feelings over dogs held a 
dozen meetings 
the temporary solution was to not enforce the law until 8 am 
the parks department is also considering confined areas for dog 
runs longer weekend offleash hours and even obedience tests where 
noleash licenses could be given for dogs that respond to their 
master 
fran lee founder of children before dogs boils in anger at 
this letting dogs run free she said increases the threat of 
bites 8000 are reported in the city each year and 
dogtransmitted diseases especially from excrement 
i happen to love animals she said but i hate the animal 
owners 
she chases owners who dont scoop up after their dogs when one 
woman refused her command lee says she picked up the poop and 
dumped it on the womans head 
when a dog is pooping on the street everyone is militant 
about that said 23yearold tina caruso who runs dogsbuddy a 
dog walking service they stand there and wait to see if you pick 
it up i make sure im standing poised with a plastic bag in my 
hand 
still if there are hassles dog owners also find rewards in 
city living 
members of the prospect park dog amp breakfast club bring bagels 
and coffee while their dogs cavort 
my dog is better socialized in the city than when we lived in 
the suburbs said melanie sutherland talking about morgan a 
border collie 
chris panny 34 said the park provided a dog play group for his 
cocker spaniel zuckie 
someone threw a tennis ball in the water zuckie went out after 
it one of a halfdozen dogs with the same idea 
look at that look at that panny said hes going to the 
middle of the lake 
zuckie mouthed the ball expertly owners all around clapped 
appreciatively

stephen j cannell has created a couple dozen 
television series among them at least two sure to be included in 
any history of television 
in 1974 cannells the rockford files premiered starring 
james garner as tvs first truly realistic private eye one who 
ran credit checks on prospective clients and quit cases immediately 
upon suffering any kind of physical threat the critics loved it 
and so did audiences 
a decade later cannell created another different series 
featuring a ragtag band of misfits who joined together to fight 
the bad guys the ateam made a cultural icon out of mr t the 
show got huge ratings but the critics hated it labeling it 
cartoonish violent junk tv 
later cannell followed with hunter a hit in ratings that 
was ignored or panned by the critics 
cannell rebounded with the critics two seasons ago with the 
simmering cerebral wiseguy starring ken wahl as a federal 
agent deep undercover in various crime venues its up for five 
emmy awards 
this coming season cannell takes another turn with top of the 
hill a thoughtful political drama starring william katt 
greatest american hero as an idealistic californian who steps 
in to take over his ailing fathers congressional seat 
the show will premiere next month on cbs 
cannell told a meeting of television critics that the show 
which has been in his mind for a few years was based on the 
reallife activist congressman leo j ryan dcalif who was 
killed by followers of the rev jim jones when he went to guyana to 
investigate jones religious cult 
ryan said cannell was an advocate for his constituency not a 
delegate a delegate says you elect me ill go to washington 
ill be your delegate in two years ill come back put my record 
before you and youll decide whether or not you want to return me 
to the house the advocate says i will be your advocate i will go 
there and if there is anything where you cannot get help where 
you are unable to use the system correctly to benefit yourself in a 
situation where youve been wronged then i will be your advocate 
katts congressman tom bell is a democrat cannell said though 
bells leaning to the liberal or conservative side will vary 
depending on the issue with which hes presented in the future 
those issues will include child custody conflicts the media 
feedingfrenzy over ethics violations and the crumbling of 
innercity schools 
katt told the television critics he himself has not considered 
running for office but he would vote for a man like bell who 
listens to his own conscience 
cannell will have five shows on the air when the new season 
opens hunter continues on nbc top of the hill and 
wiseguy are on cbs and he has the continuing 21 jump 
street and the new booker on fox this is not a record for 
cannell he had five shows on the air in 1985 the ateam 
riptide hardcastle and mccormick hunter and 
stingray 
cannell who writes many of the episodes of his shows said he 
prefers brainier stuff to the shootemups like ateam 
when i get to the part in a script where i have to do the old 
shootout or the car chase or whatever it is he said thats 
when i have to keep hitting myself in the head you know because 
the fun part is to write the characters and the relationships and 
the cerebral drama 
cannell thinks the audience kind of got tired of car chases 
i think steve bochco hill street blues la law whos a 
dear friend of mine went a long ways toward showing networks that 
you could do different kinds of programming and still entertain 
top of the hill not unlike bochcos shows will not shy 
away from making political statements but thats not its primary 
purpose cannell said i dont see my role here as inflicting my 
sense of politics on anybody else but rather to entertain you 
through good dramas dealing with good relationships 
i wouldnt know where i will eventually go with it cannell 
said but what i think im trying to say is that i think this 
country could use a political figure as a hero to look up to and 
hopefully tom bell can be that figure

not just in the automobile markets but in others 
too you might say the consumer is in the drivers seat 
the big automakers have all but conceded that theyll have to 
continue with rebates and interestrate incentives next year which 
in effect is saying that the prices theyd like to get arent the 
ones they will get 
since customers at various retail outlets including those for 
furniture and appliances also have been restraining the impulse to 
buy it seems likely that discounting could spread or at least 
that price boosts will be minor 
the mortgage market also is turning in favor of customers with 
prices for longterm fixedrate mortgages now substantially below 
those for adjustable rates which means homeowners can switch and 
lock in lower monthly payments 
there are exceptions in some areas the consumer just cant seem 
to exert much influence particularly on bank card interest rates 
which sometimes exceed 20 percent not including annual charges 
that tend to rise each year 
but overall the consumer has become a far more formidable 
challenge for sellers buyers are choosier better informed not as 
easily led and with the rise of imports they have a much greater 
selection from which to choose 
the old uniformity of consumer markets is fractured buyers are 
not nearly as predictable do you recall when carmakers told you 
what car you would be drive next year because that was what they 
were going to make and sell to you 
not any more thirty years ago market researchers could 
categorize buyers by age and income it was easy people in their 
30s and 40s were generally married probably had two kids and 
aspired to the same lifestyles 
market researchers and product designers who use the same 
measurements today are befuddled when the results dont show up no 
longer can behavior be measured by age and income today it is far 
more variable 
richard hokenson a researcher who examines our changing society 
for donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp offers a cogent 
analysis of marketplace behavior then and now 
the parents of todays babyboomers made up a far more 
homogeneous population in terms of marriage divorce and 
childbearing as well as in their opinions such as the place of 
women in the work force 
hokenson observes that nearly everyone in that generation got 
married few were divorced nearly all women became mothers and few 
women worked outside the home 
things were predictable if you had parachuted into a strange 
suburban area of the 1950s to early 1970s you would have known 
immediately from the cars parked in the driveways the sociology and 
economy of the neighborhood 
a preponderance of chevrolets would have meant residents just 
starting out as wage earners buicks and pontiacs would have 
signified a rung higher on the ladder oldsmobiles still higher 
and cadillacs the top 
in contrast markets today are rearranged by the 
marriagedivorceremarriage merrygoround there are lots of 
stepchildren and more marriedcouple families without children 
than marriedcouple families with children 
the babyboomers in other words are very different people in a 
marketing sense than their parents and any sellers who fail to 
catch the difference are headed for trouble 
a lot of companies have failed to do so many such as general 
motors corp are trying gm has been telling younger consumers 
for example that oldsmobiles are no longer just their fathers 
cars but are fit for their own tastes 
hokenson believes that the many personalities of the consumer 
will force companies to reposition products companies will have to 
search for approaches and their frustration will be seen in 
frequent changes of advertising agencies 
to adapt means that companies will have to think locally and 
regionally accommodating themselves to state and regional 
differences a vast array of new products and services are likely 
to be developed to serve the varied markets 
it isnt just that america is getting older and smarter it is 
getting more complex and demanding too says hokenson consumers 
arent the predictable and somewhat defenseless creatures they once 
may have been 
they not the sellers are dictating the terms for the time 
being anyway consumers rather than producers seem to be in the 
drivers seat

jack haley jr was only 5 but he has a vivid 
memory of his visit to the set of the wizard of oz in 1939 
the colors thats what i remember the most impressive 
incredible color ive ever seen they must had every klieg light in 
hollywood on that set he said 
and of course i remember the munchkins i thought they lived 
right there on that movie set i knew they were adults because some 
of them had mustaches and beards but i thought they were little 
people who lived in those little huts 
haley has lived with the wizard of oz most of his life the 
aura of playing the tin woodman never left his father jack haley 
and now for the golden anniversary of the movie classic haley is 
preparing a film history of the production which will appear on 
cbs next spring prior to the networks 23rd airing of the film 
the movie also appeared on nbc eight times 
the television special is part of a mammoth celebration of the 
50th anniversary of the wizard of oz the festivities include 
an army of tap dancers in new yorks herald square as part of a 
macys department store promotion aug 13 screenings of a 
mintcondition print at new yorks museum of modern art aug 1415 
release of the movie in home video with a postscript of newlyfound 
film and photos a merchandising campaign 
all of this is being directed by the turner broadcasting system 
which owns the rights to the wizard of oz 
the wizard of oz has a long history in cinema the author of 
the oz books lyman frank baum 18561919 made silent movies with 
the characters from 1914 to 1917 he started the oz film 
manufacturing co in 1914 turning out shorts as well as 
featurelength movies they were fairly successful but 
distribution problems and his own failing health caused him to 
close down the company 
samuel goldwyn purchased the rights to the oz books in 1932 for 
40000 but made no films when walt disneys snow white and the 
seven dwarfs proved a smash in 1937 studios hunted for 
childrens classics louis b mayer bought the rights for mgm for 
75000 
mervyn leroy who had directed such hardhitting films as i am 
a fugitive from a chain gang and little caesar was a curious 
choice to produce the wizard of oz he assigned writer after 
writer in an attempt to fashion a script ey yip harburg and 
harold arlen were assigned to write the songs 
because of the large budget mgm wanted shirley temple 
hollywoods no 1 moneymaker to give the film boxoffice 
insurance darryl zanuck refused to release 20th centuryfoxs most 
valuable asset judy garland was taken out of b pictures to star as 
dorothy 
leroy originally wanted ray bolger to play the tin woodman 
im not a tin performer im fluid he argued seeking the 
scarecrow instead he won his case and the woodman befell buddy 
ebsen 
ed wynn and wc fields both declined the role of the wizard 
according to the making of the wizard of oz by aljean 
harmetz the part was given to frank morgan who like ebsen and 
bolger was an mgm contract player bert lahr came from broadway to 
play the cowardly lion 
richard thorpe started directing the film on oct 12 1938 
after 12 days he was fired because his work lacked a sense of 
fantasy victor fleming took over the direction but he left before 
finishing the blackandwhite sequences he was needed to replace 
george cukor on gone with the wind 
king vidor finished directing the wizard of oz including 
the over the rainbow number but fleming received film credit 
then came another substitution the aluminum paint poisoned 
buddy ebsen and jack haley assumed the role

the wizard of oz was completed on march 16 1939 the final 
budget was 2777000 a huge amount for those times mgm launched 
a big promotion campaign in hopes of recouping the investment 
the wizard of oz premiered at the graumans chinese theater 
on aug 15 1939 the new york opening followed two nights later at 
the airconditioned capitol theater on broadway 
the reviews were mixed the new york times frank nugent 
declared it is so well intentioned so genial and so gay than 
any reviewer who would look down his nose at the funmaking should 
be spanked and sent off supperless to bed 
a number of critics qualified for such treatment the new yorker 
called the wizard of oz a stinkeroo which displays no 
trace of imagination good taste or ingenuity 
the new republics otis ferguson had unkind words for judy 
garland it isnt that this little slip of a miss spoils the 
fantasy so much as that her thumping overgrown gambols are 
characteristic of its treatment here when she is merry the house 
shakes and everybody gets wet when she is forlorn 
theater returns were good at first then fell off the wizard 
of oz grossed 3017000 for the studio causing a huge loss a 
rerelease in 194849 brought in 15 million enough to turn a 
bare profit 
the wizard would have sunk into the limbo of failed movies 
except for television in 1956 cbs was eager to broadcast gone 
with the wind but mgm refused to part with its biggest 
moneymaker 
a cbs executive suggested the wizard of oz the deal was 
struck for one screening at 225000 with an option for seven more 
at 150000 apiece the film was shown on nov 3 1956 and drew a 
huge rating later runs did even better more americans have seen 
the wizard of oz than any other movie and that record is 
likely to continue into the 21st century 
meanwhile mgmua plans to launch a sevenstory hot air balloon 
on aug 19 and fly it from hollywood to kansas to send dorothy 
home 
according to a press release we are planning an exciting day 
full of special events to send dorothy off in style

in france where world war ii is known as 3945 
to distinguish it from other german invasions people no longer 
glance nervously across the rhine but not everyone has forgotten 
im afraid not many of these men like to talk about it said 
jeanne de barrel who looks after 44 world war ii victims at the 
veterans hospital near les invalides the vast complex napoleon 
used to house the casualties of his wars 
victims from the war of 1418 are more prepared to accept 
what happened she said but for the war that started on sept 1 
1939 it is still too soon 
the approach of the 50th anniversary of the wars outbreak has 
prompted reflection on the period that saw france defeated and then 
occupied for nearly four years 
most veterans blame a nazi organization not germans madame 
de barrel said my family suffered too and will be marked 
forever but one must evolve and move forward 
maurice desmier a resident of tours who lost an arm to german 
shells on the marne in the first year of the war has long since 
gotten on with his life he heads an association of war amputees in 
france 
he is happy that a francogerman army brigade now maneuvers 
jointly he sees no problem that both countries plan to join other 
members of the european economic community in melding their 
economies in a more united europe beginning in 1992 
germany has invaded france three times since 1870 but the world 
has changed 
a decade ago spurred by personal friendship between french 
president valery giscard destaing and german chancellor helmut 
schmidt france began extending its military umbrella to its 
neighbor 
the joint army brigade symbolized the new era but the allies 
found symbols work both ways officers cannot agree on a marching 
pace significantly the unit sat out frances bastille day parade 
marking the 200th anniversary of the french revolution 
fear is gone and officially there is no bad feeling against 
the germans desmier said he paused and added of course i 
cannot say there is no resentment in peoples hearts 
attitudes vary widely by geography individual nature and 
experience 
after all these years fresh flowers appear on the white grave 
markers that seem to stretch out of sight by the beaches of 
normandy no one has removed rusting shore guns from their bunkers 
rachel ewenczyk 78 refuses to shake the hand of any german of 
her generation her father sister and brother were among the 
75000 deported french jews who did not survive death camps 
but she is warm to german exchange students who come to paris to 
visit her grandchildren 
in rural areas of the correze deep in frances heartland some 
people maintain stony silence at the mention of 3945 
but in the tiny town of moyau just off the normandy coast where 
allied forces landed to liberate france there seems to be little 
rancor 
absolutely not i have seen no resentment at all said the 
mayors wife ingrid charles a german who has lived in normandy 
since she came as an au pair girl 26 years ago 
only the dutch are sometimes reticient toward germans but 
that doesnt last long she said 
she and her husband run an elegant campground at the charles 
family chateau vacationing germans frolic in the gardens once 
seized by force of arms 
some veterans resent ungrateful countrymen as much as former 
enemies 
asked if frenchmen respected a 1940 law marking some subway and 
train seats reserved for disabled war victims desmier said 
alas no unfortunately the frenchman is a very undisciplined 
person it is the same for parking spaces it is not so hard for 
me but people with missing lower extremities find it very hard 
the french government still pays pensions to 239000 injured 
veterans 135400 widows and 46700 civilian victims of the war 
since the wars end 25 million frenchmen registered with the 
veterans ministry 
french attitudes are complicated by factors beyond the war 
germanys solid economy and brisk trade evoke a certain envy the 
west german mark not the french franc is europes hard currency 
wellheeled german tourists like the japanese are sometimes 
seen with the slightly jaundiced eye once turned on americans 
as west germany slips away from its past reticence to dabble in 
world politics bonn is jostling paris as a center of power 
in recent months the french press has devoted pages upon pages 
to issues lingering from 3945 the influential paris daily le 
monde carried a supplement on the literature of a new friendly 
germany 
scholars stress the european long view of history for many 
3949 was world war iii napoleons march eastward from france 
was first unless one counts charlemagne a millenium earlier 
because of this many frenchmen see a significant change coming 
with todays students who have no experiences to bring life to 
words on a page 
jeanmanuel bourgois director of les presses de la cite 
publishing house was forbidden as a child to make german friends 
his 19yearold daughter bears no hostility at all 
when my kids hear their grandparents talk about what they 
suffered in the war it is as if they were listening to a serial on 
television he said they dont see it as reality 
but even a generation change may not obliterate the past 
gilles leon 18 is a new european studying english and spanish 
along with his native french 
we are coming together with other europeans including the 
germans he said the war is past but something about the 
term german stays with us i think that will never disappear

a dawn raid on a sleepy priory tucked into the old 
quarter of nice ended more than 40 years on the run for frances 
last known world war ii criminal at large 
the gaunt pajamaclad old man taken away last may by police was 
paul touvier alias lacroix alias berthet alias gaillard the 
former head of a pronazi militia unit based in lyon to hunt down 
resistance fighters and jews 
fifty years after war devastated europe touviers capture has 
rewakened terrible memories of frances collaboration with cruel 
and genocidal acts of its nazi conquerers 
it also spotlights the role of some roman catholics at first 
in the church hierarchy and later among breakaway traditionalists 
in helping touvier evade the law since 1944 
if the 74yearold touvier lives long enough to face trial he 
is suffering from prostate cancer cartons of his private papers 
that he filed and took along everywhere he went during his 44 years 
underground will be made public 
the touvier case will open old wounds because it will put the 
militia on trial for the first time since immediately after the 
liberation nazi hunter serge klarsfeld said in an interview for 
the majority of french people the war is part of the middle ages 
so the trial will set the record straight about the militia 
touvier who worked closely with lyon gestapo chief klaus 
barbie was arrested at the liberation but escaped from prison he 
was twice convicted of war crimes and sentenced to death in 
absentia 
thanks to persistent lobbying on his behalf by charles duquaire 
private secretary to the archibishop of lyon touvier was pardoned 
quietly in 1971 by president georges pompidou 
the president justified his action by asking is it not the 
time to throw a veil over the times when the french didnt love 
each other and even killed each other 
most frenchman answered with a resounding no new charges 
not covered by the pardon were filed and touvier went back into 
hiding slipping in and out of monasteries and religious retreats 
throughout france italy and switzerland even walking village 
streets dressed in monks robes 
fresh charges of crimes against humanity and an international 
arrest warrant were filed in 1981 touvier is accused of 
responsibility for the execution of jewish hostages and the murder 
of victor basch 81yearold president of the league of human 
rights and baschs wife helene 
the current archbishop of lyon albert decourtray decided to 
open the local church archives to a panel of prominent lay 
historians this fall to determine the attitude of the church its 
men and its communities in the touvier affair 
i prefer the truth even if it is unpleasant to a pleasant 
lie because it is liberating decourtray said adding it was 
probable that sanctions would be pronounced against those 
clergymen who helped touvier evade the law 
klarsfeld has warned against confusing the entire church with 
the smattering of rightwing catholic traditionalists who sheltered 
touvier 
we must emphasize the enormous and sometimes unknown debt 
jews have towards the french catholic church klarsfeld wrote in 
a commentary in the daily le monde 
if threequarters of frances jewish community survived it 
was because of the solidarity and sympathy of the french people and 
the churches of france he wrote 
touvier was arrested in a dawn raid at the st francis priory 
which nice city officials had made available to the traditionalist 
followers of rebel monsignor marcel lefebvre who was 
excommunicated by the vatican last year 
though most reaction to touviers capture was favorable the 
leader of the extremeright national front jeanmarie le pen said 
he did not consider tracking down an old man a victory for human 
rights 
during the war he belonged to the militia so what after 30 
years the wounds should be healed touvier did not endanger the 
public order le pen said 
if touvier does stand trial he would be the first french 
collaborator to be tried for crimes against humanity barbie 
brought back to france after a long south american exile was 
convicted of crimes against humanity in 1987 and sentenced to life 
in prison 
but prosecutions of other collaborators have dawdled perhaps 
not suprisingly in a country where elected government officials 
cooperated with the nazi occupiers and wrote and enforced 
antijewish laws resulting in the deportation and death of some 
75000 jews 
maurice papon who was responsible for signing orders to deport 
thousands of jews from bordeaux while he was secretarygeneral of 
the gironde prefecture between june 1942 and august 1944 has been 
awaiting trial since he was charged with crimes against humanity in 
1983 
after the war papon served in many highprofile government 
posts including chief of police and budget minister under 
president valery giscard destaing 
some historians believe evidence implicating other respected 
personalities from postwar french society could be lying in dusty 
archives accessible only after long administrative paperwork 
the papon affair has had a chilling effect on archivists 
american historian robert paxton author of vichy france said 
in a telephone interview 
they may have had their knuckles rapped and they are now 
treading lightly reluctant to make public documents that might 
cause problems for prominent public officials paxton said 
french scholars paxton said prefer to forge reputations 
studying other subjects a reaction perhaps to the disagreeable 
reality of the occupation

he speaks carefully quietly and with precise 
diction he is slow to criticize slower to attack temperate in 
his positions a calm and deliberative leader friends say boring 
critics retort 
the new mr new york 
could be david dinkins avoiding the political pugilism that 
made edward i koch mayor soon may walk off with kochs job 
should he win this years election dinkins would be the citys 
first black mayor and its most laidback chief executive in a 
long while 
consider his lessthanfiery rhetoric i guess you think its 
best to just rifle off a thought without reflection dinkins 
recently scolded koch it seems to me that reflection and 
gathering of intelligence in order to make a judgment is highly 
desirable 
thats a far cry from the sharptongued incumbent whose 
combative style has alternately charmed and offended his 
constituents for a dozen years as the prototypical brash new 
yorker koch has dominated city politics 
but the city beset by social problems from crime to drugs to 
aids may be ready for a more mellow approach polls say the 
unassuming dinkins after one term as manhattan borough president 
runs even with koch and leads two other candidates in the race to 
win the sept 12 democratic primary 
ed is the quintessential hot candidate and david provides the 
perfect relief said david garth kochs political strategist 
dinkins problem is whether he has a spark kochs problem is 
that hes got too many sparks 
they say david dinkins may be too nice of a guy thats a hell 
of a compliment said rep charles rangel dny long a koch 
critic maybe new york has had enough of the damn political 
reaction and overreactions 
if koch faces voter disenchantment dinkins must confront his 
own set of hurdles some critics question his qualifications and 
his grasp of issues and they raise his failure to pay taxes for 
four years two decades ago 
but dinkins greatest challenge political tacticians say is to 
bridge racial tensions and assemble a coalition of voters blacks 
who comprise up to a third of the democratic vote whites and 
hispanics 
david has got to walk a thin line between exciting the black 
vote and inciting the white vote said steven matthews campaign 
manager for mayoral candidate harrison j goldin the city 
comptroller part of the difficulty is the perception in the 
political community at least that the issues that concern black 
voters and white voters are somewhat different 
if there are competing concerns matthews suggested that white 
voters are more worried about crime blacks about social programs 
dinkins bland and conciliatory style may reassure wary voters 
instinctively david reaches out said garth its a nice 
quality 
dinkins for example was codirector of jesse jacksons new 
york state campaign in last years democratic presidential race 
but he has not brought jackson into the city to speak for him this 
year dinkins thus has avoided exposing the old wounds of some 
black and jewish voters caused by jacksons 1984 reference to new 
york as hymietown and kochs claim that jews have got to be 
crazy to support jackson 
instead dinkins has stressed comity even to the exclusion of 
specific plans for the citys seemingly intractable problems while 
his opponents at a recent debate stressed police protection 
government corruption and failing schools dinkins took his own 
tack 
what is essential is that we strive hard to understand the 
backgrounds and heritages of each other hopefully so as to come 
one to love another but if not to love one another certainly to 
understand one another he said with understanding will come 
respect the absence of respect or disdain that some have for 
others is a large measure of our difficulty 
for dinkins such comments constitute an elliptical criticism of 
koch clearly the tone of civility he said at another debate 
is set or is not set at the highest levels of government at city 
hall 
the mayor attacks far more directly he has accused dinkins of 
tax evasion for failing to file in 1969 1970 1971 and 1972 and 
questioned whether dinkins can be trusted to manage the citys 26 
billion budget 
dinkins has apologized for his tax procrastination which 
cost him an appointment as deputy mayor in 1973 noted that it 
occurred long ago and pointed out that he was not charged with any 
crime but even his supporters concede the issue is a fair one for 
opponents to raise 
critics have raised other matters too accusing dinkins of 
indecision and fiscal inexperience he suggested easing 
restrictions on publicemployee strikes then dropped the idea he 
suggested cutting the city sales tax then backed off when reminded 
that its proceeds are earmarked for bonds 
but he largely has avoided controversy running a leaders race 
racking up union and political endorsements accentuating the 
positive its the typical campaign of a frontrunner said 
matthews it also happens to fit david perfectly 
long an active democrat dinkins 62 rose to prominence only 
recently winning the borough presidency the job is equivalent to 
a county executive in 1985 after two losing tries he spent the 
previous decade as city clerk and served one term in the state 
assembly in the mid1960s 
his own poor background dinkins has said explains his concern 
for social welfare born in trenton nj he came to new york with 
his mother a domestic after his parents separated when he was 6 
he tells of selling shopping bags on the street shining shoes 
washing dishes and cars and working his way through college and law 
school i can never remember not having a job he said 
whether he will have the citys top job remains to be seen 
dinkins would needs at least 40 percent of the primary vote to 
avoid a runoff with the secondplace finisher he had just about 40 
percent in recent polls and has led in polls on a hypothetical 
runoff against koch 
should he win the nomination dinkins likely would face rudolph 
w giuliani a former prosecutor who leads for the republican 
nomination in november dinkins leads giuliani in polls and he 
has a builtin advantage democrats outnumber republicans by 51 
an unknown factor is the extent to which some whites will refuse 
to vote for a black candidate of course its a concern there 
are members of ethnic groups who will never go for another said 
rangel who is black but he said that does not apply to the 
overwhelming majority of new yorkers 
garth held a similar view there are some racial overtones in 
everything you do but this is not a kneejerk city on the racial 
issue 
and percy sutton a former borough president and the first 
serious black candidate for mayor in 1977 said dinkins has the 
qualities to overcome prejudice 
in a city that is strident david dinkins has been a calming 
voice sutton said he is a person who brings people together

theres an ethics and pay quandary waiting for 
congress this fall and a session that began with the prospect of 
a sharp salary increase could end in what amounts to a freeze 
it wouldnt be the first house and senate salaries once were 
stalled for 33 years after a pay increase bill that stirred a 
political storm 
james madison saw it coming when the founding fathers were in 
the process of creating congress at the constitutional convention 
in 1787 he observed that to have members regulate their own 
wages was an indecent thing and might in time prove a dangerous 
one 
to review the current bidding president bush has offered to 
work with congress on a pay raise to substitute for the 
51percent increase rejected last winter that was six weeks ago 
when he also proposed legislation to phase out the speechmaking 
honoraria members now can accept as outside income 
the game plan in congress has been to tie restrictions on 
outside income to an increase in the 89500ayear salary members 
now are paid putting a spoonful of sugar with the ethics medicine 
a bipartisan house task force is studying the issues and 
probably will suggest next month that congress tighten its outside 
income restrictions in tandem with a renewed pay raise measure 
even that formula leaves democratic leaders wary that 
republicans might seize any raise as an issue against them even an 
increase endorsed by bush thats what happened on the 51percent 
raise although president ronald reagan recommended the measure and 
bush agreed 
gop campaigners trying to shake the democratic majority in the 
house figure one way to do it is by working to create a backlash 
against incumbents most of whom are democrats and theres a long 
record to demonstrate that theres no backlash like a congressional 
pay backlash 
sen robert c byrd dw va recounted that record in one of 
his lectures on congressional history tracing pay hassles to the 
current one and noting that it has revived a moribund 
200yearold constitutional amendment that would delay the 
effective date of any raise until after the next congressional 
elections twentyeight of the required 38 states have voted to 
ratify the pay amendment 
for its first 20 years congress paid its members at the rate of 
6 a day and 6 for every 20 miles traveled to get there and home 
again byrd said that worked out to 900 or 1000 a year in 
congressional salaries 
in 1816 congress voted in an annual salary of 1500 spurred 
by purported reformers who argued that members were dragging out 
speeches and thus sessions in order to collect higher pay at the 
day rate that produced an outcry and an issue that led to 
wholesale defeat of incumbents which prompted the survivors to 
repeal it they upped daily pay to 8 and it was frozen there for 
38 years 
the first annual salaries of 3000 were voted in 1856 in 
1873 congress voted to raise that to 7500 and to make it 
retroactive for two years president ulysses s grant signed it 
doubling his own pay in the process 
that backlash was explosive despite congressional arguments 
with a familiar ring sen matthew carpenter of wisconsin said his 
constituents didnt want him to live in a garret on crackers and 
cheese and dress in goatskins he said they knew that a bank 
cashier or insurance company president couldnt be hired for less 
than 10000 they believe a senator ought to have as much brains 
as a cashier of a bank or president of an insurance company he 
said 
the salary grab was the dominant issue in the next election 
carpenter was one of the casualties 
that raise was repealed and it was 33 years before congress 
risked voting itself another one 
it put salaries back at 7500 where they stayed for the next 
18 years in 1925 the senate boosted pay to 10000 with a 
latenight amendment passed with no debate the house agreed 
avoiding a roll call vote 
congress cut its pay during the depression restored it before 
world war ii but didnt get another raise until 1946 in 1955 
amid an economic boom congress boosted its pay to 22500 an 
80percent raise with little political fallout 
maybe the secret is in the timing

in the beginning there were digital 
computers they were big slow and very stupid a halfcentury 
later digital computers are very small and fast but theyre still 
hopeless idiots compared to humans 
the main problem was and still is that computers just cant 
think 
but what if computer circuits could be made to resemble our 
brains what if they could learn from their mistakes 
hundreds of tiny companies have sprung up in the past three 
years hoping to answer and cash in on those questions with an 
approach called neural networks after the neurons that are the 
basic structure of the human nervous system 
carlos tapang a 36yearold filipino physicist who left intel 
corp to start syntonic systems inc shipped what he believes is 
the first commercially available neural network chip to 
electrodyne a japanese company in may 
the chip is called dendros1 a reference to dendrites the 
highly branched filaments of nerve or brain cells that let the 
cells communicate it simulates neurons by combining a variety of 
signals to come up with a single result 
tapang compares it to measuring the flow of water through a vast 
network of differentsized pipes by emptying them into a single 
pool such a system of computing values is called analog which 
implies a continuous form of measurement like the sweep second 
hand on a watch 
digital computers like digital watches chop time and numbers 
into tiny bits and add them up one at a time in fact bits are 
the smallest unit of information in the binary system that is the 
brain of a digital computer 
the great advantage of todays digital computers is that they 
can add those bits incredibly fast even if it is done only one bit 
at a time 
there is some evidence from research on animals and people that 
the neural cells in our brains use a kind of digital system to 
transmit signals these onoff pulses called spikes confused 
early researchers and led some to believe that the brain relied on 
a digital model to process information 
instead they found it was only a tiny portion of a complex 
electrochemical system that channels signals the way tapang is 
trying to imitate a neuron by itself is dumb but the totality 
of that network of neurons in our skull is probably the most 
intelligent machine in the universe he said 
the key word is network it is the interaction of neurons in 
our brains that gives rise to thought not the action of a single 
neuron 
in that sense tapang said digital computers are doomed to be 
electronic dunces because their chips were designed to be solitary 
devices called central processing units channeling all operations 
through one electronic pipe 
even if cpus are connected the result is only a faster dunce 
however some computer scientists and industry analysts are 
skeptical 
neural networks will be a fine addition to what weve got now 
but theyll just supplement it said esther dyson editor and 
publisher of release 10 a new yorkbased computer newsletter 
theyll never replace the mathematically precise logic of a 
digital system 
i fundamentally disagree with this baited breath attitude in 
the industry about the next breakthrough being neural chips or 
networks theyre good at things like pattern recognition but still 
cannot cope with our kind of fuzzy thinking a lawyer might ask 
colonel north why did you do that and accept a fuzzy answer 
but a computer cant 
one san jose califbased company synaptics has used neural 
network technology to develop what it calls a silicon retina an 
array of photo sensors emulates the light receptors in the eye and 
an analog computer processes the image for display on a video 
monitor 
tapang uses capacitors to simulate neurons which rely on 
chemicals to transmit signals between synapses capacitors store 
and release electricity in much the same way dendros1 has one 
fixed connection and 22 variable ones that simulate synapses it 
can be layered with other chips to create an overlapping network of 
communicating capacitors that fire signals to each other 
as in the brain the firing of one electronic neuron affects the 
others an important feature is each neurons ability to damp its 
neighbors creating a pattern the variable interaction is a 
crucial part of the network 
the applications for tapangs chip include things like pattern 
recognition 
dyson agrees the best uses for neural chips and networks would 
be tasks like analyzing seismic patterns to predict earthquakes and 
hunt for oil or gas analyzing brain waves identifying 
fingerprints or other classification chores 
but she remains skeptical about their potential so does dave 
waltz of thinking machines corp in cambridge mass which makes 
a supercomputer built of up to 64000 digital processors harnessed 
together 
the problem with neural networks is that you cant keep 
expanding them waltz said the whole field of neuropsychology 
says that increasing the scale means greater complexity if you 
scale up the size of a neural net you increase the complexity of 
solving the problems you give it 
mathematicians claim they can use mathematical functions to 
achieve the same effect as neural networks and such formulas can 
be readily understood he said the main problem with neural 
networks is that we just dont understand how they really work any 
more than we understand how the brain really works 
waltz believes the boom in neural network research will slow but 
that interest will continue because it is easier to write 
programs for neural nets than for any other system almost anybody 
can play the game 
the digital age is over and the analog era is here tapang 
said the next step is making computer chips that can communicate 
with each other and this is a step in that direction

spike heels werent made for walking 
according to a yearlong study of highheel shoes that gives a leg 
up to flat footwear 
becky snow who studied heel heights because she needed a 
thesis for a masters degree in physical education and exercise 
science found that pressure on the ball of a womans foot 
increases dramatically with higher shoes 
compared with going barefoot a inch heel increases the peak 
pressure 33 percent a 2inch heel increases it 53 percent and a 
3inch heel increases it 76 percent the university of california 
biomechanicist said moreover heels shorten the time a highheeled 
foot has to adjust to the higher pressures 
the study doesnt prove high heels are unhealthy but begs 
further research into heels and posture joint deterioration and 
other foot ailments she said 
keith williams a physical education professor and 
biomechanicist who advised snow in her research said he hopes it 
prompts the fashion industry to follow athleticshoe makers by 
designing footwear with physiology in mind 
williams who has tried unsuccessfully to market dress shoes 
that are more comfortable than beautiful added maybe they 
should require the shoe designers to walk in highheel shoes 
even if the industry is reluctant said dr george holmes an 
orthopedist at university medical center in sacramento studies 
like snows will do for highheel shoes what cancer research has 
done for smoking 
if you could come out with a series of papers and studies that 
could demonstrate the deleterious effect of heels holmes said 
consumers eventually will realize whats happening 
the industry is shifting toward comfort shoes said margaret 
pennes of national shoe fair of america a new yorkbased trade 
group what started to happen is a lot of people got involved in 
walking and were wearing comfortable walking shoes and they 
started to look for the same comfort in heels 
comfort heels incorporate technology from athletic and walking 
shoes changing such things as length padding and shape to lessen 
pressure pennes said so woman who do care about what their feet 
are going to look like in 10 years have options they didnt have 
before 
the good thing about it is that looks are not being 
compromised it used to be that comfortable shoes would be nerdy 
snows study to be presented this month at an orthopedic foot 
and ankle society meeting supports what holmes and other doctors 
have suspected that foot ailments which afflict far more women 
than men may be caused by shoes 
theres not a lot of quantitative information about what 
happens when women wear high heels theres a lot of anecdotal 
information but not scientific data to back up statements people 
make williams said 
while other research has measured stride length force and heel 
stability snow said a lack of techology prevented a study like 
hers until recently 
snow 28 used a machine called a pedobarograph invented in 
england in 1976 and updated by a british bioengineer three years 
ago for use with personal computers to analyze pressure on the 
balls of the feet 
the pedobarograph calculates foot pressure by measuring light 
deflected by walking across a lit glass plate covered by opaque 
plastic the deflected light is recorded by a camera and translated 
by computer into graphs 
snow a certified athletic trainer who routinely wears running 
shoes but sometimes dons 2inch pumps for dressier occasions 
initially intended to study amputee runners but switched because 
of the difficulty finding enough people who run on artificial limbs 
for a scientific study 
to recruit highheel wearers after newspaper ads failed she 
went to the campus quad and listened for the click click 
click of womens heels she convinced 45 women to give up two 
lunch hours to walk across the pedobarograph barefoot and in each 
of three heel heights inch 2inch and 3inch 
a companion study of heels effect on posture and gait involved 
11 women who spend nine hours each in a battery of tests in one 
they walked barefoot and in heels on a treadmill while cameras 
recorded the movement of fluorescent dots on their backs legs and 
ankles similar tests focused on changes in the spine pelvis and 
shoulders that study proved inconclusive snow said 
even so she said in speaking with people about high heels 
or even in talking to my subjects afterwards if i see them on 
campus theyll say you know ive stopped wearing high heels

bill coughenours breed is rarer than 
the bachman sparrow a tiny ozarks songbird on the endangered 
species list 
coughenour bands hummingbirds rubythroated hummingbirds to 
be exact 
only 31 people are fully licensed by the federal government to 
put numbered metal bands on the legs of the tiny aerial acrobats 
coughenour is among a few who have limited permits to work under 
supervision of the master banders 
ive banded about 350 hummingbirds in the three years ive 
been licensed i might end up banding 250 to 300 this year said 
coughenour 41 who learned to band from his greatuncle jim 
johnson the only master in the state 
johnson 85 of holister has banded some 2000 hummingbirds 
over the past 20 years earning him the nickname the hummingbird 
man coughenours sister sarah driver of springfield also bands 
under his direction 
theres millions of hummingbirds out there and theres just 
not enough of us banding said coughenour the whole reason for 
banding is to get information about birds and their habits 
particularly migration 
coughenhour a businessman who bands birds as a hobby uses a 
homemade nylon net trap with a feeder filled with sugar water as 
bait to catch the hummers at his home in nixa and at the 
springfield nature center 
he then carefully weighs the birds most weigh about 3 grams 
the equivalent of three plastic sandwich bags and notes the sex 
approximate age and general condition the whole process takes just 
a few minutes 
seventeen species of hummingbirds are found in the united 
states but only the rubythroated variety is common east of the 
great plains 
hummingbirds are attracted to almost any plant with red 
blossoms and are easily drawn to feeders filled with one part 
sugar to four parts water johnson said the ruby throats named for 
the males brilliant red throat patch consume up to a gallon of 
sugar water a day at 10 feeders around his home each summer 
the longbilled birds have a voracious appetite for sweet nectar 
to fuel their supercharged metabolism hummingbirds wings beat an 
astounding 50 to 70 times a second as they hover and feed but 
speed up to 200 beats per second when they need to zip away at up 
to 60 mph 
hummingbirds migrate long distances including a 600mile trip 
nonstop across the gulf of mexico to spend the winter in south and 
central america the birds can live five to eight years and return 
each year to the same territory 
i have found them to be just such friendly little rascals 
they are so curious johnson said they have some kind of 
personal reaction to humans its hard to describe but once you 
get to fooling with them you realize they are very responsive 
birds you can really get to know them individually 
making friends with a hummingbird is no trouble at all all 
you need is sugar water to get their attention i have a standing 
bet with people that if they have one to three hummingbirds at a 
feeder i can have one perching on my finger in 20 minutes if you 
get near the feeder and remain motionless theyll perch right on 
your finger as they feed its the darndest thing 
coughenour who gives public talks and banding exhibitions each 
summer at the springfield nature center said many of the older 
people remember a time when everyone had formal flower gardens and 
people would sit outside in the summertime and really enjoy the 
hummingbirds 
some people my age have never seen a hummingbird when they 
do theyre fascinated its a real joy particularly with little 
kids to see the delight in their eyes when showing them such a 
small fragile creature 
they are very very beautiful to look at

in posters of bronzed sunworshippers shes 
sultry and hes hot and both need to avoid ultraviolet rays if 
they want to stay that way 
in a broadcast and poster campaign launched last week the 
cancer society is using sports illustrated swimsuit models like 
cheryl tiegs to convince teens that tanning is out and the 
undamaged look is in 
those who burn most easily and have the highest risk of skin 
cancer are caucasians with light hair and eyes said northwestern 
university dermatologist dr june robinson head of the american 
cancer society skin cancer task force 
teens lured by bronzed bodies also are more prone to risk 
overexposure robinson said we keep telling teenagers to stay 
out of the sun but they dont listen they want to look like 
sports illustrated models 
calling any of these sports illustrated swimsuit models a 10 
is no compliment a breathy voice in the tv spot says as the 
models whip back their hair and rub suntan lotion on their legs 
they are definitely 15s because when theyre in the sun each 
of them uses a suncreen with at least a spf of 15 as recommended by 
the american cancer society to help rub out skin cancer 
robinson and stanley tannenbaum a northwestern advertising 
professor launched the campaign to encourage use of lotions with a 
sun protection factor of 15 or greater a sunscreen with spf 15 
enables the user to stay in the sun 15 times longer than without 
sunscreen 
posters will be given to schools and health clubs on request tv 
and radio announcements were mailed to chicago stations 
the campaign was undertaken after the society found the 
incidence of malignant melanoma the most deadly of skin cancers 
growing at a rate of 34 percent a year faster than that of any 
other cancer it estimates half of all people who live to 65 will 
have skin cancer at some time and predicts malignant melanoma will 
kill 6000 this year often because of sun damage 20 years ago 
warning signs of melanoma are raggededged moles uneven in 
color and about the size of a pencil eraser they increase in size 
bleed easily and commonly appear on the backs of men and the legs 
of women

ultrasharp microblades that rival 
some of the best modern cutting tools may provide a glimpse into 
the lives of primitive people who wandered from asia to the pacific 
northwest eons ago 
this is the sharpest thing there is said washington state 
university archaeologist robert e ackerman as he looked at drawers 
of blades chipped from obsidian a hard volcanic glass and chert 
a finegrained tough rock this is sharper than any surgeons 
instrument 
in fact it is now being used in some eye surgery 
the abundance of microblades and the blocks from which they were 
chipped across the soviet union and into alaska are solid clues to 
how primitive people wandered from asia to the pacific northwest 
ackerman said these microblade cores are very distinctive like 
pottery helping to identify the cultures of the people who made 
them and the times in which they lived 
akerman and other researchers from around the world shared their 
knowledge at a circumpacific prehistory conference last week in 
seattle 
while a number of theories support the creation of land bridge 
as the ice age lowered ocean levels the trail of blades show a 
clear migration of people from 30000 years ago to 12000 years 
ago ackerman says 
many of the blades were made of obsidian a finegrained 
volcanic mineral available throughout the pacific rims ring of 
fire and because they will not decompose the blades have left 
researchers with unique timeline

britains anglo group plc has proposed setting 
up a threemember voting trust to oversee farmers group inc as 
part of its bid for bat industries plc an apparent move to thwart 
us insurance opposition 
an anglo group subsidiary holyake investments ltd has offered 
216 billion none of it in cash for the british tobacco 
financial services retailing and paper conglomerate 
the bid is being reviewed by us insurance regulators because 
bat owns farmers the los angelesbased insurance company bat 
acquired late last year for 52 billion 
anglo group said wednesday in a letter to insurance 
commissioners in the nine states where farmers does busines it had 
proposed three trustees for the voting trust that would hold 
farmers until its sale 
holyake made up of anglofrench financier sir james goldsmith 
british investor jacob rothschild australian investor kerry packer 
and other investors has said it would sell farmers if its bat 
acquisition goes through 
the sale would be subject to the approval of the state insurance 
commissioners and under the proposal the trustees would oversee 
management of the company in the interim 
holyake has filed nine lawsuits seeking to take the bids 
insurance aspects away from state regulators and place them in 
federal court 
the three proposed trustees are daniel j evans a former us 
senator from washington shirley m hufstedler a lawyer and former 
us education secretary and david m sherwood former president 
of the prudential insurance co of america and currently president 
of the new york insurance exchange 
the appointment of these individuals completely independent 
of anglo and holyake and any related parties will serve to 
underscore the independence we propose for farmers anglo group 
chairman albert j dunlap said 
former us treasury secretary william e simon was quoted in 
the wall street journal on wednesday as saying he is a potential 
buyer for farmers 
simon who leads an independent investor group that has been 
involved in several leveraged buyouts also emerged as an equity

pressures on pricing and an overall cost structure that is plainly 
too large relative to our current and projected business volumes 
the memo said according to the post 
last month unisys based in blue bell pa reported earnings 
of 536 million on revenues of 257 billion in the quarter ended 
june 30 a 67 percent decline from earnings of 1623 million on 
revenues of 239 billion in the same quarter of 1988 
also in the quarter defense business declined by about 50 
percent from the previous years level because three unisys 
divisions were barred from bidding on defense contracts after a 
former executive and consultant pleaded guilty to conspiracy 
charges in a pentagon procurement scandal 
the company laid off 2100 employees earlier this year

the seeds sown by deregulation of the us 
airline industry are bearing fruit as a renewed takeover frenzy 
could bring a major reshaping of the business experts say 
many industry watchers believe intense competition spawned by 
the easing of regulations in 1978 has made some carriers highly 
desirable properties and turned others into desperate seekers of 
merger partners 
the results are likely to be further consolidation although a 
number of experts dont expect ticket prices to jump radically as a 
result in the near future 
things are exciting at this point said louis marckesano an 
airline analyst for the investment firm janney montgomery scott 
inc in philadelphia now weve seen the domino effect as it goes 
through each of the airlines 
within the past week 
united airlines parent ual corp received a buyout proposal 
from investor marvin davis and troubled pan am corp indicated it 
also might be interested in merging with ual 
a pittsburghbased manufacturing company revealed it owned 66 
percent of midway airlines and might consider a takeover of the 
chicagobased regional carrier 
an investor group completed its 4 billion buyout of northwest 
airlines parent nwa inc 
frequently rumored takeover target usair group inc completed 
its merger with piedmont and separately sold a major stake to 
white knight investor warren buffett 
the latest trend comes after a lull following an earlier merger 
wave sparked by deregulation that wave saw a severe consolidation 
of the industry as big carriers such as nwa texas air corp 
delta air lines inc and trans world airlines inc swallowed up 
such airlines as people express republic ozark and western in 
order to meet the competition of the newly wide open markets 
now successful airlines such as northwest and united have 
become hot properties stalked by bigtime investors unions and 
rival airlines 
on the other hand those considered victims of deregulation 
such as pan am and eastern have been forced to change course in 
order to survive 
financially weak pan am for example has said it needs to merge 
with another carrier to survive the company unsuccessfully 
proposed a merger with nwa and pan am chairman thomas plaskett 
said wednesday the carrier would now consider making a bid for ual 
eastern rocked by a strike that forced it to seek bankruptcy 
court protection has undertaken a plan to reorganize as a smaller 
more efficient carrier eastern is owned by texas air 
the takeover frenzy comes against a backdrop of increasingly 
restive airline unions eastern airlines pilots machinists union 
members and flight attendants have entered the sixth month of a 
strike and there are rumblings of a possible walkout against 
northwest by its 5000 pilots who have been without a contract for 
2 years 
the unions dipping into their pension funds also have jumped 
on the takeover bandwagon pilots at united made a 45 billion bid 
for the airline in early 1987 and recently indicated they remained 
interested in some form of ownership and the 20000member 
machinists union local at northwest was one of the suitors for nwa 
wouldbe airline buyers must reckon with a government regulatory 
policy that has so far proven more stringent under the bush 
administration than under the reagan white house 
transportation secretary samuel skinner has indicated the 
government might not look kindly on airline buyouts that load up 
the companies with new debt for example he has expressed concern 
that the acquisition of nwa might have a substantial adverse 
impact on nwas financial structure by among other things 
jacking up its debt to about 37 billion 
skinner also has warned that the government would closely 
scrutinize the possible competitive impact of the sales of assets 
such as routes 
it looks as though we have a real secretary of transportation 
now said economist alfred e kahn former head of the defunct 
civil aeronautics board and widely regarded as the main architect 
of airline deregulation kahn had been critical of what he saw as 
an overly lenient policy toward mergers under the reagan 
administration 
after the latest takeover wave the industry could look 
radically different and even more consolidated analysts say 
marckesano said many midsized carriers such as midway which 
compete with the majors and the tiny commuter lines are facing 
turbulent times and could be swallowed up 
but consolidation isnt expected to raise fares which have been 
steadily rising in recent months amid strong passenger traffic and 
may have peaked for the near term analysts say 
a rare summer air fare war broke out last week as several major 
carriers matched a weekend discount program begun by continental 
airlines 
fares obviously had jumped very substantially the carriers 
are clearly beginning to encounter resistance kahn said

the bonwit teller and b altman department store 
chains and their parent company lj hooker corp have filed for 
bankruptcy court protection citing debt problems that caused 
concern among the chains suppliers 
but several other hooker subsidiaries were not included in the 
filing late wednesday in us bankruptcy court in new york a 
company representative said 
lj hooker said it has retained the management firm sigoloff 
and associates to run the company during the chapter 11 bankruptcy 
proceedings the firm has rehabilitated a number of troubled 
companies lj hooker said 
lj hooker is a subsidiary of hooker corp an australian 
company with major us retail and realestate development 
interests for several months the the parent company has 
experienced severe financial problems and in late july it said it 
was turning its operations over to a courtappointed liquidator in 
australia 
hooker blamed its troubles on sluggish us consumer spending 
high australian interest rates and exchange rate fluctuations 
in a statement wednesday sanford sigoloff of the management 
firm said the bankruptcy filing would allow lj hooker to 
restructure and repay debts which total about 12 billion 
sigoloff is a former chairman of the wickes cos inc a retailing 
and manufacturing company 
hooker said the bankruptcy filing was prompted by the inability 
to reach an agreement with lenders to refinance its unsecured debt 
the statement said several hooker developments including retail 
projects of south carolina and store chains including birmingham 
alabased parisian department stores and houstonbased sakowitz 
were not included in the bankruptcy filing 
david mcadam of sitrick and company a public relations firm 
representing hooker said late wednesday that it will be business 
as usual for holdings that are part of the filing 
they will continue to build or sell whatever it is they build 
or sell mcadam said it just puts a freeze on all previous 
creditors and gives the company breathing space to reorganize and 
go forward 
if they were nailing boards a week ago theyll be nailing 
boards tomorrow he said 
mcadam said employees will be paid as usual at hooker 
subsidiaries included in the bankruptcy filing 
sigoloff said it is unclear what steps will be taken in the 
reorganization 
it is important for everyone to understand that chapter 11 
does not mean we are going to close all of the operations of the 
corporation or that all hooker employees are going to lose their 
jobs sigoloff said 
daily operations will continue as usual stores will remain 
open and transactions which occur in the ordinary course of 
business will go on just before the filing he said 
under chapter 11 a company obtains a federal court order that 
frees it from the threat of creditors lawsuits until it can 
develop a plan to put its finances in order while the 
reorganization proceeds the activities of management must be 
approved by the court the ultimate reorganization plan must be 
accepted by a majority of the creditors

los angeles investor marvin davis says hes 
encouraged by ual corps noncommittal response to his 521 
billion takeover bid a move that apparently leaves the company 
open to other offers 
following a special meeting wednesday that lasted into the 
night the ual board of directors said it was premature to make 
a decision on what it called davis highly conditional proposal 
to buy the company for 240 a share 
it was the first time ual the suburban chicagobased parent of 
united airlines disclosed the value of the offer which would 
total about 521 billion based on uals 217 million shares 
outstanding 
davis responded with a brief statement through his company 
davis corp that said we were encouraged by the boards 
response and look forward to meeting with the company and its 
representatives as soon as possible 
bids from other investors eyeing ual are likely to follow 
analysts said 
the overture has thrust the company into play obviously and 
theres really no turning back said timothy pettee an airline 
industry analyst with merril lynch capital markets the company 
has got to pursue some financial transaction that maintains the 
current stock prices 
in composite new york stock exchange trading wednesday ual 
stock surged 2462 to close at 24387 a share amid rumors that 
davis bid was worth 240 a share ual shares have leaped more than 
100 in the past year 
after a nearly sixhour meeting the ual board issued a short 
statement wednesday night saying it had determined that while it 
was premature to make a decision as to whether a sale of the 
company to mr davis or any other party at the present time would 
be appropriate it was desirable to explore all possible financial 
and strategic alternatives including remaining independent 
it has always been and continues to be the desire of the board 
to promote the longterm growth of united airlines as a major us 
air carrier ual chairman stephen m wolf said in the statement 
wolf said the board would take into account the interests of its 
shareholders customers and employees in any decisions on its 
future operations growth and ownership 
spokesmen for davis and ual refused to elaborate on their 
statements they would not say whether a meeting had been arranged 
between the parties or what the next step might be 
ual is an attractive takeover target because it owns 80 percent 
of its 408jet fleet which can be sold to finance debt from a 
takeover 
the nations secondlargest carrier behind american airlines 
also has a vast route network in the pacific the worlds 
fastestgrowing airtravel market 
but merrill lynchs pettee said davis is not necessarily a 
strong suitor 
davis is playing the stock market and hes playing it very 
adroitly pettee said he hasnt given any indication that he 
is serious about taking over the company judging by his actions 
with nwa 
davis who owns a considerable portion of ual stock reaped 30 
million on his unsuccessful attempt to takeover northwest airlines 
parent nwa inc earlier this year a group led by los angeles 
investor alfred checchi acquired nwa for 365 billion 
one possible scenario for ual according to wall street 
observers is that management employees and the companys largest 
shareholder saul steinberg will join forces in a leveraged buyout 
steinberg and wolf are longtime business associates and friends

procter amp gamble co today reported a 221 
percent jump in its fourthquarter profit as the costs of closing 
and consolidating some operations were more than offset by income 
gains from higher unit sales 
for the three months ended june 30 the consumer products giant 
said income rose to 171 million or 99 cents a share up from 140 
million or 82 cents a share in the prior years final quarter 
sales grew 92 percent to 54 billion from 498 billion of a year 
earlier 
investors reacted positively to procter amp gambles results the 
stock surged 425 to 12225 a share in early trading on the new 
york stock exchange 
the quarterly income was reduced by an aftertax provision of 
78 million to cover the closing of a chicago plant and some other 
us operating departments as part of pampgs effort to consolidate 
manufacturing operations 
but profit from higher unit volumes in the fourth quarter 
compared with the year before more than compensated for the 
negative impact that the onetime costs had on earnings the 
company said 
for the entire year procter amp gamble earned 121 billion or 
712 a share an 18 percent gain from 102 billion or 596 a 
share a year earlier sales rose 107 percent to 214 billion 
from 1934 billion 
pampg chairman and chief executive john g smale and president 
john e pepper said in a joint statement that they were 
reasonably pleased with the past years results while noting 
that the longterm development of their businesses was more 
important than a single years performance 
as we enter the 1990s our objective is to build on the 
momentum generated within the company during the past few years and 
to rise to the challenge of the more highly competitive markets we 
will face in the coming decade the executives said in a news 
release

general mills inc says its new benefit meets 
all the requirements of a breakfast cereal you pour milk over the 
flakes in a bowl and eat them with a spoon 
but procter amp gamble co contends that benefit which general 
mills says has been shown to reduce cholesterol when used in a 
lowfat diet is actually a drug and should meet drug testing 
requirements 
pampg which sells overthecounter medicines has asked the food 
and drug administration to pull benefit off the market something 
general mills says it has no intention of doing 
its a cereal thats made from grain its consumed like a 
cereal its no different from any other cereal thats on the 
marketplace that contains soluble fiber and has the ability to 
lower cholesterol general mills spokesman craig shulstad said 
wednesday 
the fda is reviewing procter amp gambles june 8 request and is 
expected to respond soon said chris lecos press officer for the 
agency 
benefit contains oat bran rice and psyllium a grain grown 
mainly in india the outer husk of psyllium contains soluble fiber 
which has been shown to reduce cholesterol 
psyllium also is an ingredient in cincinnatibased procter amp 
gambles metamucil a fiber laxative pampg had asked the fda to 
allow the company to make cholesterollowering claims for 
metamucil but the agency said more tests were needed company 
spokesman bill dobson said 
according to general mills which is based in the minneapolis 
suburb of golden valley tests conducted in 1987 on men with 
average and aboveaverage cholesterol levels found that benefit 
reduced cholesterol levels an average of 9 percent when 2 ounces 
were eaten daily as part of a lowfat diet 
benefit accounted for about twothirds of the reduction the 
company said 
the benefit package touts the cereals claims of reducing 
cholesterol a fatty substance that can build up in inner artery 
walls the deposits can narrow blood vessels decrease the blood 
flow and may lead to a heart attack or stroke 
kellogg co made a similar claim in 1984 when it linked 
consumption of allbran a highfiber cereal with reduction of 
cancer risks 
the fda could have declared the cereal a drug forcing kellogg 
to undergo lengthy procedures for drug approval but fda 
commissioner dr frank young said such action which could have 
entailed seizing allbran would have been ridiculous 
instead the agency decided to come up with a regulation that 
would allow health claims on labels a process that is still under 
way 
pampg which also makes toiletries soap detergents and other 
household and food products claims general mills is playing by a 
different set of rules from drug manufacturers in being allowed to 
make health claims without fda approval 
pampgs dobson said the company recently submitted to the fda the 
results of additional tests on the cholesterollowering effects of 
metamucil and more tests may be required an earlier study found 
metamucil reduced cholesterol about 15 percent he said 
dobson said its unfair for pampg to have to substantiate its 
cholesterollowering claims for metamucil while general mills can 
make the same claims for a food product without getting fda 
approval 
general mills which also makes cheerios and wheaties cereals 
began distributing benefit in minneapolisst paul and milwaukee in 
late april and early may 
the company has expanded distribution to 28 percent of the 
country primarily in the midwest but has announced no plans on 
expanding marketing nationally shulstad said

some savers can expect less interest on their 
deposits and families may soon find it a bit less expensive to buy 
a home as the government today begins spending 50 billion to 
resolve the savings and loan crisis 
president bush signed legislation wednesday committing american 
taxpayers to an estimated 157 billion 600 for every man woman 
and child over the next 30 years to solve the nations biggest 
financial crisis since the depression 
we can and will preserve a safe efficient and equitable 
financial system for ourselves and for our kids bush said 
before signing a bill providing money to cover more than 100 
billion in sampl losses over the past decade to speculative and 
often fraudulent lending 
the treasury department planned today to borrow the first 5 
billion of a 20 billion downpayment to be made over the next seven 
weeks to reduce an estimated 20 million in daily losses by 
insolvent but still operating sampls 
l william seidman head of the federal deposit insurance corp 
and in charge of the daytoday cleanup said threefourths of the 
first 20 billion will be used to reduce interest rates being 
offered by some shaky thrifts to attract deposits those rates are 
expected to fall from 11 percent to 8 percent or 9 percent 
that step alone affecting an estimated 50 billion in highrate 
certificates of deposit held by savers is expected to immediately 
cut the daily losses by 2 million or 3 million say seidman and 
private analysts 
most of the 50 billion in highrate cds have short durations 
30 60 or 90 days as they expire savers can either withdraw their 
deposits or roll them over at interest rates 2 to 3 percentage 
points lower 
to whatever extent there are withdrawals the government will 
use 15 billion of what it is borrowing this month and next at 
interest rates of about 8 percent to replace the highrate cds and 
sustain the institutions with enough cash to keep operating 
private analysts said they expect the infusion of lowerrate 
government cash into the ailing sampls to ripple throughout the 
industry putting downward pressure on rates for all deposits as 
well as the rates borrowers pay for new home mortgages and other 
loans 
those trying to buy homes also should benefit because the bill 
pushes sampls back into home mortgage lending and out of risky 
investments such as speculative commercial real estate projects and 
junk bonds 
thrifts will be required to raise the level of housing and 
housingrelated loans in their portfolios to 70 percent from 60 
percent 
unresolved is whether the resolution trust corp the agency 
created to close or merge 400 to 700 insolvent or marginally 
solvent sampls over the next 26 months will unilaterally reduce 
interest rates on highrate longterm cds with durations up to 30 
months 
the trust corporations predecessor the federal home loan bank 
board had honored those interest rates in taking over failed sampls 
fdic director cc hope jr said he expected a decision in the 
next few days 
whatever that decision analysts said they expected the influx 
of government cash into the troubled institutions about onesixth 
of the industry to ripple throughout the entire financial system 
it will be a generational impact because people over 50 have 
more cash and savings and people under 50 generally have more 
debt said alex sheshunoff a private analyst 
as interest rates come down its going to benefit borrowers 
more than depositors he said the last chance to catch the 
highrate cd freight train was before 1045 am wednesday when 
bush signed the bill 
immediately upon bushs signature the resolution trust corp 
authorized spending 215 million to liquidate or subsidize the 
merger of three of 262 ailing thrifts the government has taken over 
since february 
another 600 million was authorized for liquidations and mergers 
over the next two weeks 
officials anticipate it will take 26 months and the expenditure 
of all 50 billion provided in the legislation to stem the 
industrys losses assuming interest rates dont rise 
including interest on the money being borrowed to address the 
crisis the bailout will cost 159 billion over the next 10 years 
and 285 billion 157 billion of it from taxpayers over 30 
years according to administration and congressional estimates 
sampl owners will be required to put up billions of dollars more 
of their own money as a buffer between risky loans and the 
governments deposit insurance funds so these problems will never 
happen again bush said

grain and soybean futures were mostly higher 
early today on the chicago board of trade as traders staked out 
their positions or took to the sidelines ahead of an agriculture 
department crop report 
the report scheduled for release in washington at 3 pm edt 
will doubtless project substantially larger corn and soybean 
harvests than last year when drought cut deeply into the crops 
the early gains in the soybean market also reflected perceptions 
that the soviet union recently bought soybean meal from brazil 
analysts said 
some soybean buying also was linked to worries about the 
relatively dry weather so far this month in the midwest where 
soybean pollination is well under way and weekly showers are needed 
to keep the process moving along 
in early trading wheat was cent lower to 1 cent higher with 
the contract for delivery in september at 395 a bushel corn was 
cent to 1 cents higher with september at 224 a bushel oats 
were 1 cent to 1 cents higher with september at 137 a bushel 
soybeans were 2 cents to 8 cents higher with august at 602 a 
bushel

a unit of reliance group holdings inc said it 
has agreed to sell atlantabased days inns corp to the hotel 
chains largest franchise tollmanhundley hotels 
under terms of the deal tollmanhundley would pay 90 million 
in cash and assume 675 million in debt 
brian t martin a spokesman for reliance group holdings owner 
of the limited partnership reliance capital group said wednesday 
that all that remains to close the deal is for tollmanhundley to 
arrange financing 
we have a willing buyer and a willing seller martin said 
assuming financing there is every reason to believe the deal 
will go forward 
michael a leven days president and chief operating officer 
had said several months ago that the company was for sale he noted 
that the business of reliance whose chairman is wall street 
financier saul steinberg is investments not hotel operating 
days sales last year amounted to 1 billion the chain operates 
858 hotels and has 522 others under construction 
reliance bought the chain in 1984 from the cecil b day family 
for 615 million 
leven said wednesday that monty d hundley a partner of 
tollmanhundley assured him that days headquarters would remain 
in atlanta with the companys entire management team intact 
he asked me if id stay and i said only if we stayed in 
atlanta leven said hundley is largely responsible for leven 
being named days president 
shortly after reliance acquired days in 1984 hundley 
recommended leven for the job the two men were introduced by a 
mutual business acquaintance leven was hired by chairman and chief 
executive officer henry a silverman who is also president of 
reliance capital 
leven said silverman would stay with reliance and resign from 
days 
he said he was confident that financing would be arranged he 
said drexel burnham lambert inc in new york is serving as 
tollmanhundleys investment banker 
they are hotel people very committed to the days inn system 
leven said of tollmanhundley i feel that if this purchase goes 
through it will remove once and for all the spectre of being sold 
we will be able to continue the direction of the company without 
the fear of a new owner coming in and changing things 
we just want to see them do more of the same said hundley 
the people running the company are doing a heck of a job and 
wed like to see them continue 
drexel next week would review the terms of the proposed 
transaction if the firm approves it would then line up financing 
usually the process takes 30 to 60 days 
tollmanhundley owns 129 hotels including 48 days inns

the smooth voice on the telephone offered juliet zucker 
something she really needed a chance to get away on a summer break 
at a bargain price if she would just give the caller her visa 
creditcard number 
i was a little stir crazy and thought this would be a nice 
thing to do recalled zucker a washington research analyst on 
maternity leave who put aside lurking suspicions about the 350 
package she gave her account number to the caller then got her 
suitcases ready the bill came but the trip didnt 
zucker was taken by whats known as telemarketing fraud one of 
several gimmicks used by sophisticated thieves who prey on the 
multibillion dollar creditcard industry their tools to falsify 
duplicate and deceive range from purloined creditcard receipts to 
microwave ovens used to alter stolen cards 
the victims bear little or no financial liability if they report 
frauds promptly but their credit ratings may be tainted until the 
frauds are detected the creditcard industry says all users are 
indirect victims because the cost of fraud is passed on via higher 
creditcard interest rates for everyone 
the industry has combatted a counterfeiting problem with some 
success in the united states by making cards harder to duplicate 
nonetheless it still faces steady losses through phony customer 
applications doctored cards and the boilerroom schemes like 
the one that ruined zuckers vacation plans 
every time we close a door theyre working on the other doors 
to see if theyre open said richard ward special agent in 
charge of the new york field office of the secret service which 
has jurisdiction over crimes involving credit cards it never 
seems to stop 
for the first half of this year the secret service said it made 
760 credit cardrelated arrests and estimates industrywide losses 
from those cases at 897 million last year it made 1846 arrests 
and put losses at 1891 million up from 1620 arrests in 1987 and 
274 million in losses 
while the statistics show progress in enforcement major credit 
card companies and credit reporting agencies say many more 
hucksters from common thieves to foreignbased crime rings 
remain busy filching fortunes 
industrywide creditcard losses are difficult to assess visa 
international the largest bank creditcard issuer said it lost 
1888 million worldwide last year telemarketing fraud excluded 
accounting for 009 percent of its total volume 
that was up from 1661 million the previous year although down 
slightly in volume from 010 percent in 1983 the year before the 
secret service took over enforcement of revised federal creditcard 
laws visa lost 1017 million or 015 percent of total volume 
mastercard international inc said worldwide losses totaled 
12867 million in 1988 telemarketing fraud excluded or 010 
percent of volume up from 989 million or 009 percent in 1987 
six years ago losses totaled 655 million or 013 percent of 
volume 
american express co another leading issuer of plastic doesnt 
release figures on fraudrelated losses 
some experts say that besides christmas the summerfall 
vacation season is the busiest time of year for creditcard 
thieves who find that naive travelers make the easiest targets 
a lot occurs outside the united states in locations where 
travel is frequent said joel s lisker vice president of 
security and fraud control at mastercard 
lisker said the asiapacific region has replaced france and 
spain as a growing problem area with card counterfeiting and 
alterations by street gangs accounting for nearly half of the total 
fraud losses reported there 
in a common fraud case here and abroad a thief will steal an 
unsuspecting tourists credit card then charge the maximum amount 
allowed before the victim reports the card missing said william d 
neumann a senior vice president of security and risk management at 
visa 
a stolen card also can be altered and later used by filing 
or melting the account number in a microwave oven and reembossing 
it with a legitimate number this could come from dishonest 
merchants or thieves who rifle trash cans outside a store or 
restaurant for discarded creditcard receipts 
some dishonest merchants accept what are known as white 
cards or plain plastic embassed with legitimate names and 
numbers that give the appearance of a legal transaction when passed 
through a creditcard machine 
ward said a growing threat is the more sophisticated thief who 
files fraudulent creditcard applications with a smathering of 
legitimate information in many cases that information comes from 
criminals who take jobs as janitors or security guards in order to 
steal personnel records he said 
legitimate information can also come from telemarketing cons 
that include claims of lowcost travel club memberships or 
sweepstake contests he said 
in the case of zucker con artists claimed to represent a 
chicago travel agent in a promotional deal offered to visa card 
members it took months for zucker to realize the scam because 
before she paid the bill she received mailed information on travel 
destinations to choose from in the next year 
zucker is among the lucky some hucksters use the numbers 
received over the phone to charge up a storm as well as apply for 
new credit cards 
the other day some guy ordered an 8000 watch over the phone 
and charged it to his credit card ward said what made it 
suspicious was the guy was from the bronx ny and the store was 
in some small town in maryland 
under laws designed to protect cardholders they are liable for 
up to 50 of unauthorized purchases before reporting a card missing 
because creditcard frauds are becoming more sophisticated the 
card companies are concocting new antifraud devices that expand on 
the introduction of hardtoduplicate magnetic patterns placed on 
cards in the early 1980s 
visa for example has introduced an optional security device 
that will add more information to the magnetic strips that will 
verify a card isnt phony mastercard said it will introduce the 
same optional feature within the next few months along with 
hardertoerase embossed numbers 
the two creditcard giants also have established a special 
computerized clearinghouse in chicago to screen applications about 
70 percent of all us card application volume is processed there 
lisker said 
he said the clearinghouse checks data and alerts members when a 
name address or social security numbers are used repeatedly 
thwarting possible fraudulent applications

the costly federal bailout of the beleaguered thrift industry 
has provoked everything from anger to ambivalence from the american 
public although many depositors say their confidence in the 
soundness of the nations banking system remains virtually unshaken 
every individual who has money in a savings and loan has to be 
aware that the government insures the money and the comfort 
level that the savers should have is directly related to the 
comfort they have with the federal government said ronald hyde 
who keeps checking and savings accounts with thrifts in the phoenix 
area 
echoing the sentiments of a number of americans hyde said he 
approved of the longawaited thrift industry rescue plan that 
president bush signed into law on wednesday but called the cost 
for carrying it out shocking at the very least 
the landmark legislation will require the government to spend a 
whopping 285 billion over the next 30 years more than half of 
that from taxpayers to close or dispose of moneylosing thrifts 
it is the most expensive industry rescue in history and some 
experts say it will cost each american taxpayer at least 1500 
a spot check by the associated press of depositors in cities 
nationwide suggested widespread resentment that taxpayers must pay 
for the industrys problems most of the thrifts problems can be 
traced to the early 1980s when the industry was deregulated 
permitting sampls to enter a broad array of new riskier businesses 
i think it stinks said ramiro salazar a 55yearold mail 
carrier from the los angeles area how could they let it the 
thrift problem get so out of hand 
this should not have happened said john mcgirk a computer 
technician in new york the regulators knew this was coming and 
they should have done something about it before making us pay for 
it 
but simone hyams of tucson said that maybe by helping the 
sampls get back on their feet that will help the economy im glad 
that the government is interfering 
some depositors said they didnt believe the bailout mattered 
one way or the other 
im really not that familiar with it to say said barbara 
sawyer of baltimore a customer of baltimore federal financial 
hopefully it wont affect me 
in texas where much of the industrys problems have occurred 
many thrift depositors admitted only a vague awareness of the 
bailout and its potential impact 
most sampl depositors questioned by the ap said they wouldnt rush 
to withdraw their money because the federal government insures all 
thrift deposits up to 100000 
a recent survey of despositors by sheshunoff amp co an 
independent research firm that follows the banking industry also 
found that only 9 percent had withdrawn their money as a result of 
the widely publicized problems of financial institutions 
salazar who keeps 10000 invested in a certificate of deposit 
at coast savings amp loan association in los angeles said that if 
the bailout causes thrift interest rates to fall as many expects 
predict hell probably transfer money to his credit union 
theyre basically paying the same interest he said but 
the credit union seems a little more stable 
roger middleton who banks at miami savings amp loan said hed 
also consider pulling his money out of the florida thrift if rates 
went down but hes not sure where hed go 
for the average bank customer a bank or sampl is the only 
place middleton said they most investors dont have big 
chunks of money they can work with and investments safer than 
money market accounts and savings accounts are hard to find 
many ailing sampls paid premium rates on things like certificates 
of deposits to attract funds and some healthy institutions matched 
them to remain competitive

ltv corp three years into one of the nations 
largest bankruptcies said thursday its secondquarter earnings 
fell 755 percent in part because of allowances for discontinued 
steel and aircraft operations 
the steelmaker and defense contractor reported that its net 
profit for the quarter ended june 30 dropped to 303 million or 
18 cents a share from 1239 million or 89 cents a share in the 
same quarter last year 
secondquarter revenue tumbled to 166 billion from 206 
billion a year earlier 
ltv said the revenue decline reflects the june 1988 sale of its 
warren ohio steel plant and exclusion of 1989 results for the 
steel bar division which is to be sold 
the company blamed its earnings decline on a 50 million charge 
for estimated cost increases in various aircraft components a 
437 million decline in steel operating income because of the 
reduction of those operations and a 30 million special charge for 
canceling construction of a flexible composite center for 
production of advanced aircraft components 
the 1988 second quarter included a 30 million special charge 
for costs of discontinuing medium and heavy military truck business 
the major disappointment of the latest quarter was a loss 
reported for ltvs aircraft products group caused primarily by 50 
million of charges related to performance on commercial aircraft 
programs and projected cost increases in fixedprice development 
programs for military aircraft said ltv chairman raymond a hay 
for the first half of the year net profit was 1069 million 
or 73 cents a share compared with a net loss of 201 billion a 
year earlier 
firsthalf sales fell to 328 billion from 394 billion a year 
earlier 
the 1988 first half included a 226 billion charge because of a 
change in accounting for pension fund obligations 
ltv said wednesday it had reached agreement with its major 
private creditor over the size of its claim against ltv 
ltv said cyprus minerals co a mining company based in denver 
had agreed that it had a 505 million claim against ltv instead of 
the original 17 billion it was seeking 
the size of the claim will be used in determining how cyprus 
minerals will share in the proceeds from the bankruptcy proceeding 
the government agency which insures pension funds has the 
largest outstanding claim against ltv claiming that the company 
owes more than 2 billion for three underfunded pension funds 
ltv which has been under bankruptcy protection for three years 
has until nov 8 to propose a reorganization plan

a trickle of picketline crossovers has become a 
steady stream since the eastern airlines pilots leadership 
discussed ending their 5monthold strike sources said thursday 
boosting management efforts to rebuild without the unions 
in meetings beginning sunday striking pilots resoundingly 
rejected proposals to go back to work however sources who didnt 
want to be identified said the number of pilots crossing the picket 
lines neared 600 up from 200 at the strikes beginning on march 4 
and from 385 a week ago 
pilots union spokesman ron cole said that number sounds 
inflated but he agreed crossovers have increased 
i wouldnt call it dissension in the union cole said i 
think people are making their individual choices based on economic 
hardships after being on strike 5 months 
cole suggested that the returning pilots wont work well with 
newly hired pilots mixing newly returned veterans with recruits 
will cause safety problems and that many recruits will leave 
eastern because they are losing companypromised rapid advancement 
to the veterans 
sources familiar with the pilots returning to work this week 
said some have expressed disaffection with the union leadership and 
belief the strike has been doomed 
the leadership of easterns air line pilots association met 
thursday in washington to discuss strategy and review the series of 
overwhelming votes this week for continuing the strike 
company spokesman robin matell said eastern has stopped 
releasing the number of crossovers 
we just decided not to go with a daily box score as a company 
policy decision during a period of meetings the pilots have held 
around the country matell said there are a number of pilots 
returning but we really would like to see how things shake out in 
the next several days 
matell added theres no question eastern is well on track to 
meeting its goal of 1700 pilots by years end 
the company has said it has graduated some 300 newly hired 
pilots from training and has nearly 800 pilots in training which 
lasts six to eight weeks 
machinists union leader charles bryan declined comment thursday 
on the pilots situation earlier this week machinists senior 
general chairman wally haber called the pilots the backbone of 
the strike 
the pilots solidarity with the machinists who struck after 18 
months of federal mediation stunned eastern management which 
hoped to keep flying without the machinists with only 200 of the 
3600 pilots flying eastern struggled to fly 10 percent of its 
prestrike schedule of nearly 1100 flights daily and filed for 
chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization march 9 
a rebuilding plan proposed to easterns creditors envisions an 
airline twothirds its prestrike size flying 800 daily flights 
eastern expects to increase its daily schedule from 350 to 390 
flights on aug 15 and reach 800 by years end eastern had to 
lease planes and pilot crews from sister carrier continental 
airlines this month 
the unions including striking flight attendants predicted 
eastern couldnt rebuild without them and are backing a buyout bid 
by chicago businessman joseph ritchie which has been spurned by 
easterns parent texas air corp 
however local and national pilots union leaders last week 
raised the possibility of ending the strike as a way to protect 
jobs and union strength most members reacted bitterly to the 
suggestion after months of pledges never again to work for texas 
air chairman frank lorenzo 
the troops are very very upset the eastern pilots are 
absolutely livid about the thought of going back to work said a 
pilots union activist who asked not to be identified 
eastern alpa chairman jack bavis reportedly told his members in 
miami sunday night they should consider ending the strike 
if he bavis is advocating capitulation in any way he is 
representing a distinct minority view said john anderson an 
alpa spokesman in new york there arent that many jobs to go 
back to if we capitulate to frank lorenzo wed be going back to 
unsafe cockpits 
eastern says it wouldnt have jobs for all the striking pilots 
if they returned because it wont lay off the newly hired pilots 
union officials have indicated they believe pilots returning from a 
strike must be given their jobs back over recruits still in 
training 
meanwhile the pilots union leadership is trying to rally its 
troops with plans saturday to build the longest moving picket 
line in us history in a march beginning in miami and continuing 
up the east coast 
it really can be viewed as the thread of continuity for all 
the activities that are going on cole said he added that the 
demonstration including rallies in cities along the way will 
culminate in the labor day parade in new york

general motors corp chairman roger b smith is 
among the first in line for one aerobics instructor abbie miller 
of st paul minn has her order in former south dakota gov bill 
janklow says no thanks 
theyre talking about the newest generation of the chevrolet 
corvette the zr1 with an engine that puts more punch into 
americas original twoseat muscle car than ever before 
detroits automotive press has been gushing praise for the car 
calling it gms hightech answer to the porsche and ferrari without 
their higher pricetags 
but dont expect to see thousands of zr1s screaming down the 
interstates at top speed with youthful joyriders at the wheel 
chevrolet marketing experts anticipate buyers will be predominantly 
collegeeducated males in their 40s with household incomes of at 
least 100000 
with a production schedule of 3000 for the 1990 model year and 
a price between 50000 and 60000 the car zr1 is aimed at 
luring at least some wouldbe customers of the european luxury 
performance cars 
weve clearly got enough interest in this thing to sell out 
this year once we set the price and get on with it said 
chevrolet spokesman ralph kramer 
the final price is to be determined late this month when the 
zr1 begins rolling off the assembly line in bowling green ky 
its 57liter 32valve v8 engine with 375 horsepower can 
propel the car from 0 to 60 mph in 42 seconds less time than it 
takes a phone to ring three times 
the car also comes with a special switch that shuts off half the 
valves commonly called a valet key that temporarily tames the 
monster engine and prevents hotdogging car jockeys from roaring 
around the parking lot 
the zr1 doesnt have the most horsepower of any assemblyline 
production corvette a 1967 model with 435 horsepower did but it 
does have the highest top speed of any corvette at about 180 mph 
it has fuel economy ratings of 16 mpg in city driving and 25 mpg on 
the highway good enough to avoid the federal governments 
gasguzzler tax 
its the latest in a long line of corvettes dating to the 
original 300 produced in 1953 since then more than 900000 have 
been made and theyve created a cult with its own magazines clubs 
and rallies devoted to the cars groundhugging bullet appearance 
i guess its the excitement its like a dream car said 
mrs miller 49 who owns two other corvettes and has had her order 
in for a zr1 since july 24 
as head of gm smith gets first dibs hes had his order in 
since late last year 
the zr1 originally was planned as a 1989 car but engineering 
and marketing decisions pushed the introduction back to this month 
making it a 1990 in the automotive industrys calendar year 
despite the cars power highway patrol officers evidently 
arent too worried about an outbreak of zr1 speedmania 
i think that irresponsible people cant afford that car and 
those people who can afford it arent likely to risk their 
investment by driving dangerously on the highway he said 
aside from that regardless of how fast they are they arent 
faster than a radio 
janklow governor of south dakota from 197886 is one corvette 
owner whos had some experience with law enforcement officers on 
highways he owns a 1969 ttop 427 corvette a car hes unafraid to 
push to its limit 
i was notorious for my speeding said janklow who has 
received about 100 speeding tickets its just a great 
automobile its americas one unique touch of freedom 
he talks enthusiastically about his 1969 corvette but the zr1 
evidently packs too much muscle for him janklow said he doesnt 
plan to buy one 
even joe pike a retired chevrolet merchandising manager and 
former editor of the corvette news magazine said he has some 
reservations about the newest models power 
i dont think theres half of 1 percent of the people who buy 
that car who are capable of driving it he said i dont think 
i could drive it anymore even if you could find a place to drive it 
its the kind of car that belongs on the autobahn in 
germany

minoru arakawa president of the japanese companys us 
subsidiary said nintendo wants to have an interactive 
entertainment and informational network in the marketplace sometime 
in 1990 
the nintendo network would compete with such services for 
personal computers as prodigy which is owned by international 
business machines corp and sears roebuck amp co and compuserve 
which is owned by hampr block inc 
by yearend more than 20 million us households will have 
the nes and in 1990 each of these households will have access to 
the nes network arakawa said 
nintendos entertainment system an electronic device that 
retails for 80 to 100 has been one of the most popular toys in 
this country for the past several years the system hooks up to a 
television set to display such games as super mario brothers 2

having nintendo devices form part of an information delivery 
network 
several major and recognizable companies have approached 
nintendo to ask how they can become involved lindner said he 
declined to give any names saying no formal agreements have been 
signed with atampt or any other company

equipment for the us system has not yet been determined 
by the end of the year lindner said nintendo estimates it will 
have its games in 21 percent of us households

the nations tart cherry crop is 
coming in below estimates because of frost kills and delayed 
ripening in michigan marketers said thursday 
government forecasters had predicted michigan would grow 190 
million pounds of a total of 261 million pounds of tart cherries to 
be produced in the united states this year 
instead the michigan crop now being harvested looks to be as 
low as 160 million pounds even less than last years 
droughtstunted crop said phil korson of the cherry marketing 
institute in okemos 
not all of the drop is from spring crop damage korson said 1989 
crop estimates from the us department of agriculture likely were 
too high 
michigan ordinarily produces more than threefourths of the 
nations tart cherries the smaller crop should not affect 
consumers who see tart cherries in pie fillings and baked goods 
korson said 
i dont think were looking at a shortage were looking at 
stable prices really he said 
processors are getting about 49 cents a pound for tart cherries 
the same as last year when a drought cut michigan production to 180 
million pounds korson said 
uneven ripening from a cool spring immature fruit because of a 
fungus that denuded many trees and bruised fruit from high winds 
have caused widespread quality problems 
i would say in every producing area some of the crop couldnt 
find a market said john minnema president of cherry central 
cooperative inc in traverse city its unusual for that to be 
so widespread 
a full crop would have pushed national cherry production 24 
million pounds ahead of what korson said the market could handle 
and that would have driven prices down cherry growers already 
complain it costs more to produce their fruit than they can get for 
it 
many growers have cut back on pruning mowing and spraying to 
save money that has further reduced production said norman 
veliquette president of the great lakes packing co in antrim 
county growers have cut agricultural practices to the bone he 
said 
a late frost in the heart of michigan cherry country this spring 
killed enough blossoms that gov james blanchard declared a farm 
disaster in four counties so growers there can apply for federal 
aid

jack taylor has a saying you dont 
drive a corvette you wear it 
if youve ever sat in one you kind of have that feeling 
said taylor director of manufacturing engineering at the general 
motors corp corvette plant at bowling green its a statement of 
peoples success in life 
taylor calls his 1966 blue corvette an adult pacifier 
the cars introduced to america in 1953 pacify such wellknown 
adults as mike love of the beach boys members of the singing group 
alabama who own four basketball great michael jordan and 
entertainer sammy davis jr 
the car also is the choice of such renowned speedsters as al 
unser mario andretti and chuck yeager signed photographs of their 
corvettes hang on walls in the plants visitors area and the snack 
bar 
this year chevrolet will make 26411 cars at the only plant 
that assembles the corvette americas first twoseat sports car 
of these 3000 will be the souped up zr1 model 
corvette assembly moved to bowling green from st louis in 
august 1979 the first car rolled off the kentucky line in 1981 
the 1millionsquarefoot plant about the size of 22 football 
fields houses more than a mile of railroad track and 7 miles of 
conveyor track 
about 1250 workers and 65 robots produce 14 cars an hour a 
piddling line speed in a world where many factories crank out a car 
a minute 
we want to make our quality the best it can be said jim 
case a trim utility auditor a person who owns a corvette is 
proud of his car he knows everybody looks at it and wants one 
the price of corvette is pushing it farther from reach 
the standard coupe now sells for about 34000 the convertible 
for 40000 the zr1 which begins production later this month 
will cost 50000 to 60000 
nonetheless the corvette plant tour is popular even among 
people who could never afford to buy the car jane bowlin a gm 
spokeswoman said about 40000 people toured the plant last year 
making it one of kentuckys most crowded tourist attractions 
the plant also is a shrine among corvette owners some leave 
their calling cards 
corvette club patches fill a display case outside the visitors 
area theyre from the thunder basin corvettes in gillette wyo 
the vette set from decatur ill and the flood city corvettes from 
johnstown pa 
some people take their vacation to come here mrs bowlin 
said pointing out patches from hawaii switzerland and sweden 
inside the corvette plant some things are done a little 
differently from others 
during the painting process the outside of the car is covered 
in plastic wrap and workers apply a flat black paint to hidden and 
hardtoreach parts including the firewall and the inside of the 
hood 
we want to cover all the places only corvette nuts would 
look paint supervisor bob breeding said

soybean futures prices closed moderately higher 
while grain futures finished mostly higher thursday on the chicago 
board of trade in subdued trading ahead of an agriculture 
department crop report 
firmer cash markets supported the futures along with signs of 
increased export demand for us corn 
but analysts said most of the buying reflected positionevening 
by traders seeking to reduce their exposure to potential price 
swings resulting from the crop report 
people are just kind of waiting to see what weve got dale 
gustafson an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc said before 
the reports release 
the report released in washington at 3 pm edt after the 
markets close projected a 24 percent increase in the soybean 
harvest and a 49 percent larger corn harvest than last year when 
drought cut deeply into the crops 
the corn and soybean numbers were slightly lower than traders 
had expected and could prompt buying of futures contracts on friday 
at the close wheat was 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 396 a bushel corn was 
unchanged to 1 cents higher with september at 224 a bushel 
oats were 1 cents to 1 cents higher with september at 137 a

corn production is rebounding from last years 
drought the agriculture department said thursday estimating the 
1989 crop at 735 billion bushels an increase of 49 percent over 
last falls stunted harvest of 49 billion bushels 
the estimates were based on usdas first fields surveys of the 
year and reflected conditions as of aug 1 
overall the departments agricultural statistics board put 
total us crop production at 103 percent of the 1977 average a 
scale used to compare output from year to year 
the latest figures came a week after congress responding to 
flooding in the south and drought in the plains approved an 897 
million disaster relief bill for farmers 
while corn and soybean production were estimated at about 
average for the decade wheat production across the grain belt was 
forecast at weaker than usual levels with fields losing 
substantial moisture since early july 
corn is the largest and most important crop grown on american 
farms and used as feed is essential to meat poultry and dairy 
production 
agriculture department economists had projected the corn crop at 
785 billion bushels in june and revised that to 745 billion last 
month due in part to late plantings in the eastern corn belt and 
dry fields in the west 
in the midwest however rains starting in midjuly replenished 
some of the subsoil moisture that had been lost 
usda economists estimated the yield per acre of corn in 1989 at 
1128 bushels per acre up 282 bushels from last year but 66 
bushels below the record high of 1194 bushels produced in 1987 
they estimated that 652 million acres would be harvested up 12 
percent from 1988 but 1 percent less than the july forecast 
soybean production was estimated by usdas agricultural 
statistics board at 191 billion bushels up 24 percent from last 
years harvest of 154 billion 
usda economists forecast the soybean yield at 323 bushels per 
acre the fourth highest of record and 24 percent above a year ago 
production of all wheat was estimated at 204 billion bushels 
up 13 percent from the 1988 harvest of 181 billion bushels that 
was 3 percent below the july estimate from usda 
winter wheat production was estimated at 147 billion bushels 
down 6 percent from last year durum wheat was indicated at 907 
million bushels up 102 percent from the 1988 harvest but down 19 
percent from the july forecast because of drought problems in the 
dakotas 
the average yield for all wheat was forecast at 326 bushels per 
acre just 15 below last years level with an estimated area for 
harvest of 627 million acres 
other spring wheat was forecast at 487 million bushels down 10 
percent from the july forecast but more than double the 1988 crop 
with the soviet grain crop forecast down and export prospects 
good stocks of wheat next june are projected at 474 million 
bushels almost 120 million below last month and 220 million below 
the start of the year 
cotton production was estimated at 118 million bales down 23 
percent from last year and 20 percent below 1987 
consumer prices for food rose at an annualized rate of 7 percent 
in the first half of 1989 as cold weather hit vegetable fields in 
florida california and mexico poultry prices also rose sharply on 
increased demand 
but usda economists are expecting consumer prices to rise no 
more than 1 percent on an annualized basis in the second half

by the late 1990s cars will have

now a ford motor co executive said thursday 
our planning is geared toward this eventuality when electronic 
systems control all vehicle functional systems said frank e 
macher general manager of the ford electronics division 
today electronics control such components as fuel consumption 
engine cooling and braking in some cars and the time needed to 
develop these electronic systems is shrinking 
while much of future vehicles may be controlled by electronics 
consumers may be turning away from a plethora of gadgets chrysler 
corps design chief said earlier this week 
thomas gale a chrysler vice president said in an interview at 
the companys headquarters in highland park mich that the 
explosion in electronics has produced cars that are complex to 
operate and mindboggling options 
gale said chryslers new cars of the mid1990s probably will be 
simpler with fewer options offered

swept ahead 
with about a half hour to go in the session a wave of buying 
pushed the dow past the record closing high of 272242 it reached 
on aug 25 1987 but then prices settled back a bit 
most other broader market indicators have already surpassed 
their 1987 peaks and they added to those gains today 
but brokers said many investors were waiting for the venerable 
dow to join them in a kind of official certification that stocks 
had fully recovered from the 87 crash 
intense activity in airline issues and other stocks reported or 
rumored to be takeover candidates helped keep the market in high

japans buying of us commercial real estate 
has surged ahead since 1986 and its 1002 billion worth of 
holdings last year was far larger than any other countrys the 
us general accounting office says 
most countries positions have remained somewhat stable with 
the notable exception of japan which in just a few years has grown 
from a relatively modest share to almost double that held by the 
united kingdom said allan i mendelowitz the director of the 
office for trade energy and finance issues 
japanese holdings increased 643 percent from 1987 to 1988 he 
added 
the office makes audits for congress mendelowitz statement 
came in a letter to sen quentin n burdick of north dakota the 
letter dated july 31 was made available thursday 
britains commercial real estate holdings in 1988 were given as 
532 billion britain was followed by canada with 417 billion 
the netherlands with 334 billion and the netherlands antilles 
with 319 billion 
the letter to burdick updated a report to him of july 10 that 
report listed the netherlands antilles a group of five small 
caribbean islands as one of four identity havens used to 
conceal the names of actual owners the others were switzerland 
liechtenstein and panama 
the figures represent only a small proportion of total real 
estate values in the united states the national association of 
realtors a private group estimated last november that the value 
of all foreign real estate holdings in 1986 was only 15 percent of 
us commercial holdings leaving out farmland and land used for 
housing 
citizens of other countries owned even a smaller proportion of 
american farms about 1 percent according to the report 
it said foreign holdings of farmland amounted to almost 125 
million acres worth nearly 95 billion in 1988 britons were the 
biggest holders with 106 million acres followed by swiss with 28 
million acres 
using an older set of figures the bureau of economic analysis

the nations top aviation official said 
thursday that dc10s are safe with no evidence to justify grounding 
the plane despite two incidents in a month involving explosive 
engine failure 
federal aviation administrator james b busey defended the dc10 
at a news briefing as a governmentindustry task force began 
examining possible design changes in the mcdonnell douglas plane 
and other widebody jetliners to prevent explosive engine failures 
from disabling the planes 
its safe to fly i would fly in the aircraft today busey 
said of the dc10 less than a day after a northwest airlines dc10 
made a safe emergency landing in denver with holes blasted in the 
housing of its tailmounted engine 
we know of no hard facts that would lead us to take action to 
ground the dc10 the administrator said when asked about its 
safety 
busey formed the task force last month citing the july 19 crash 
of a united airlines dc10 that killed 111 people in sioux city 
iowa and two other incidents in which systems that control the 
aircraft were damaged in flight one involved a japan air lines 
boeing 747 in 1985 and the other an eastern airlines lockheed 
l1011 in 1981 
investigators said the united dc10s rear engine apparently 
disintegrated in flight knocking out critical hydraulic flight 
controls that meet in the planes tail section 
busey who has been faa administrator for six weeks said it was 
too early to make comparisons between the sioux city crash and the 
denver landing which he said showed the way the system is 
supposed to work 
the united plane carried general electric engines while the 
northwest plane had pratt and whitney engines 
busey acknowledged that the safety of the dc10 was a key 
issue of concern for all of us he said the federal aviation 
administration was participating in the denver investigation being 
conducted by the national transportation safety board 
he said that as facts are gathered the faa would consider 
whether to order inspections on all dc10s and whether to take 
other action 
any decision to ground the plane would be made only after 
careful deliberation he said 
to act speculatively or on the basis of incomplete information 
in my judgment would be irresponsible busey said 
i personally like the dc10 its a very comfortable and 
goodperforming aircraft he said 
more than 450 dc10s are flown by 50 airlines around the world 
all dc10s were grounded for a month in 1979 after an american 
airlines plane lost a wing engine severing hydraulic lines as the 
plane was taking off from chicago investigators blame the crash 
which killed 258 people on faulty maintenance 
the administrator said the task force would compare construction 
of the four widebody planes the dc10 the 747 the l1011 and 
the europeanmade airbus to determine whether hydraulic systems 
can be better protected from engine failures 
hydraulic lines control the wing and tail mechanisms that steer 
planes 
he declined to say how long it would take for any changes to be 
made but said he wants the task force to complete its work and 
make recommendations as quickly as possible the group includes faa 
officials representatives of aircraft and engine manufactuers and 
other us and foreign aviation experts 
on another aviation issues busey 
said a device capable of detecting plastic explosives in 
luggage is expected to be in operation at new yorks john f 
kennedy international airport next month with others to be 
installed in london frankfurt west germany miami and san 
francisco within a few months 
announced that near midair collision reports received from 
pilots of all types of planes totaled 280 for the first six months 
of 1989 down 25 percent from the same period last year he said 
there were seven collisions from january through june compared 
with 12 a year ago 
said air traffic controller errors and pilot deviations also 
are down this year he credited improved educational regulatory 
and enforcement measures 
controller errors he said fell 8 percent from 509 to 469 
pilot deviations declined 30 percent from 1580 to 1104 
a near midair collision is defined by the faa as a 
separation of less than 500 feet between planes when there is a 
danger of a collision an operational error occurs when controllers 
fail to keep aircraft set distances apart a pilot deviation 
involves violations of faa regulations such as failure to follow a 
controllers directions or honor established flying procedures

a government report projecting smaller corn and soybean harvests 
than grain traders had expected will likely boost futures prices 
ending a monthlong decline in the markets for those commodities 
analysts said thursday 
grain and soybean futures advanced modestly thursday on the 
chicago board of trade before the agriculture department crop 
report was released and much stronger gains were predicted for 
friday 
on other markets coffee futures prices fell sharply energy 
futures rose precious metals were higher and livestock and meat 
futures were mixed 
in chicago wheat settled 2 cents lower to cent higher with 
the contract for delivery in september at 395 a bushel corn was 
cent to 2 cents higher with september at 225 a bushel oats 
were 1 cents to 1 cents higher with september at 137 a bushel 
soybeans were 3 cents to 9 cents higher with august at 603 a 
bushel 
the crop report covered a variety of agricultural commodities 
but futures traders in chicago were most interested in the corn and 
soybean numbers because supplies of those important commodities 
were hit especially hard by last years drought 
the usda projected a corn harvest of 735 billion bushels 49 
percent greater than last years 492 billionbushel crop the 
agency projected a soybean harvest of 191 billion bushels 24 
percent above last years harvest of 154 billion bushels 
traders were anticipating projections for a 53 percent increase 
in corn production and a 26 percent larger soybean crop 
the difference between the markets expectations and the usda 
numbers alone would probably be enough to spark a wave of buying 
friday but analysts predicted a bigger reaction based on 
indications that most speculators were positioned to profit from 
falling prices 
i think this is going to unnerve these guys and blow them out 
of the water said dale gustafson an analyst in chicago with 
drexel burnham lambert inc 
he predicted opening gains of up to 20 cents a bushel in the 
soybean market and 8 cents a bushel in the corn market 
the usda projected production of all wheat at 204 billion 
bushels up 13 percent from the 1988 harvest of 181 billion 
bushels 
coffee futures sank on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange 
amid renewed aggressiveness on the part of producers seeking to 
increase their share of the recently deregulated market 
esther eskanasy an analyst with cargill investor services inc 
said colombia the worlds secondlargest producer had dropped its 
offering prices by 2 cents a pound on thursday 
coffee prices already are at 13year lows near 80 cents a pound 
analyst kim badenhop of merrill lynch capital markets inc said 
prices were likely to fall further 
were looking at something like 76 cents or so as possiblity 
on the downside and fundamentally i cant argue with that he 
said 
coffee settled 236 cents to 275 cents lower with september at 
7997 cents a pound 
energy futures prices climbed on the new york mercantile 
exchange partly on technical factors and partly on optimism 
generated by the energy departments weekly supply report which 
showed lowerthanexpected stocks of crude oil and gasoline 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 20 cents to 38 cents 
higher with september at 1859 a barrel heating oil was 58 cent

income from tourism in the first half of 1989 was 
down 1 percent from the same period last year china said thursday 
although it has virtually halted since troops crushed the 
prodemocracy movement in june 
in the first six months of the year china earned 970 million 
from tourism said he guangwei deputy director of the national 
tourism administration 
the number of tourists dropped 143 pthe officia the same period 
last year to 1289 million people the official xinhua news agency 
quoted he as saying he did not explain the reason for the decrease 
tourists stopped coming altogether immediately after the june 
34 crackdown in beijing in which hundreds perhaps thousands of 
student protesters and their supporters were killed 
the summer months are the height of the tourist season but only 
a few foreigners are visiting china the united states still is 
advising americans not to make unnecessary trips to china although 
the state department on wednesday allowed dependents of us 
diplomats to return 
he predicted that 22 million tourists will visit china in 1989 
and the industry will earn 13 billion others however are not 
as optimistic 
i dont think this year is going to be a very exciting year as 
far as business is concerned said bernd riegger general manager 
of the holiday inn lido in beijing 
the lido and other major hotels in beijing are reporting 
occupancy rates of 45 percent to 50 percent but many of their 
guests are businessmen rather than tourists the lido is normally 
90 percent full at the height of the tourist season riegger said 
beijings smaller older hotels are faring much worse with 
only a handful of rooms seen lighted at night 
the beijing tourism administration has ordered hotels to cut 
staff salaries by up to 25 percent to compensate for the loss and 
hotel employees said some workers have been laid off 
taxi drivers complain they must wait hours for a passenger and 
often are unable to meet their daily fare quotas 
we in the tourism industry are the most directly affected by 
the crackdown said one driver who waited five hours for a fare 
but he predicted the industry will soon rise from loss he 
said china will send delegations to tour fairs in chicago london 
and tokyo this year and tour groups will be given discounts but he 
did not elaborate 
china has slashed air fares on 71 domestic routes by 20 percent 
to attract more passengers and some branches of the staterun tour 
agency have announced discounts of 10 percent to 20 percent on 
package tour rates 
last month china invited 400 travel agents from around the 
world for a twoday allexpensespaid seminar to show how safe and 
normal beijing is 
some travel agents said however that tourists would stay away 
as long as martial law remains in effect in beijing where armed 
soldiers guard intersections and bridges

experts in japanese business practices were 
startled thursday by charges that executives of a huge us 
subsidiary of japans shuwa corp beat and sexually harassed 
employees here 
it would be hard for me to presume that those allegations 
could be true said william ouchi a professor at uclas anderson 
graduate school of management and the author of theory z how 
american management can meet the japanese challenge 
the assertions were made by former employees of shuwa 
investments corp which has made headlines by buying the arco 
towers in los angeles the abc building in new york and the former 
us news amp world report headquarters in washington 
accountant hajime tanioka says in a superior court suit filed 
last week and amended wednesday that he was repeatedly assaulted by 
executive vice president takeshi shiratori and president takaji 
kobayashi of the los angelesbased firm kobayashis father founded 
the parent company 
and in a suit filed late last year in superior court former 
company secretary dawn marie stover says she was pinched slapped 
fondled and ogled by vice president kiichiro kobayashi the cousin 
of takaji kobayashi 
kiichiro kobayashi denied the allegations and in turn accused 
ms stover of beating him and berating him with derogatory and 
racist epithets 
calls to shiratori and takaji kobayashi were referred to lawyer 
craig b jorgensen who said that although he had yet to see the 
tanioka lawsuit from what he knew of the claims i think they 
are false and were going to defend it vigorously and i think well 
win it 
ouchi whose research has taken him to mazda and toyota auto 
plants a sony tv factory and the offices of many japanese 
corporations in the united states said it would be 
exceptionally unusual for a manager to strike a subordinate 
theres a great deal of formality in most of the social 
relationships in japan whether at work or in the community life 
outside of work and touching another person is a much more 
socially aggressive act than it is in the us ouchi said 
typically the japanese executives here treat their american 
subordinates with if anything slightly more respect than is 
typical in japan because in a sense they are guests here in our 
country and they recognize that and they tend to be extra polite 
dennis laurie who interviewed 201 americans working at 21 
japanese companies while preparing his doctoral dissertation at the 
peter f drucker graduate management center at the claremont 
graduate school said the allegations if true are an absolute 
anomaly 
i saw nothing like this laurie said thats not to say 
there werent cultural differences but the japanese maintained 
very cordial relationships with their workers here particularly 
with the women 
laurie said japanese managers here are well aware that their 
actions will be scrutinized more closely than those of americans 
and agreed that many are more cautious than they would be in japan 
everything ive seen indicates theyd double their efforts in 
a precautionary way 
in his lawsuit tanioka says takaji kobayashi struck him with a 
telephone and calculator punched him in the stomach and threw a 
set of keys at him when kobayashi learned that tanioka was seeing a 
former employee 
tanioka alleges that kobayashi struck him on the head with a 
book while the accountant was recovering from an eye injury after 
tanioka refused to work overtime 
the suit also alleges that shiratori hit the accountant with a 
ruler and rolled up newspapers and magazines tanioka who says he 
was forced to resign from the company also says he repeatedly was 
verbally abused and called fool and idiot 
ms stover who quit in 1988 alleges that kiichiro kobayashi 
made sexual suggestions as well as hitting and touching her and 
striking her with rulers and other objects

two swiss franc traders pleaded guilty thursday 
and a third pleaded innocent to charges stemming from an undercover 
fbi probe of fraudulent trading at the worlds largest commodities 
markets 
william walsh 23 and mark fuhrman 39 traders in the swiss 
franc pit at the chicago mercantile exchange each pleaded guilty 
to one count of wire fraud and one count of making prearranged 
trades in violation of the federal commodities exchange act 
a third indicted trader robert mosky 33 pleaded innocent 
before us district judge ann c williams to charges of 
racketeering conspiracy 26 counts of mail and wire fraud and 37 
counts of violating the exchange act 
a federal grand jury indicted 46 people aug 2 for trading 
activities at the merc or the chicago board of trade 
later thursday the board of trade announced its members had 
voted to more than triple the inhouse fine for each rule 
violation from 75000 to 250000 spokesman mark prout said 
we wanted to demonstrate that members are serious about 
maintaining the integrity of these markets prout said it 
should act as quite a deterrent 
five of those indicted including walsh and fuhrman have so far 
agreed to plead guilty and cooperate with prosecutors most charges 
allege schemes in which traders pocketed profits from trades made 
for customers while passing their own losses on to customers 
walsh and fuhrman admitted in plea agreements that their actions 
were part of an ongoing pattern of illegal transactions at the 
merc both implicated mosky and agreed to testify against him 
on october 13 1988 i entered in a prearranged trade with 
undercover fbi agent randy jacksondesigned to limit my tax 
liability and at the same time receive cash back at a later date 
a downcast walsh told the judge 
at the time you engaged in this act you knew it was wrong 
ms williams asked 
yes walsh replied 
fbi agent randy jannett who used the name randy jackson as 
an alias during the undercover probe looked on from the back of 
the court as the pleas were entered 
walsh said he earned 1450 in unreported income from two trades 
with the agent one of which was executed for the firm shearson 
lehman hutton the confirmation of the trades through electronic 
wire communication resulted in the wire fraud charge 
on the following day walsh said he sold jackson swiss 
franc contracts at a better price than he could have gotten in an 
openmarket trade and jackson returned 70 percent of the profit 
fuhrman said he made a prearranged trade with the undercover 
agent on dec 15 1988 and received 1465 from him in profit on 
another occasion fuhrman said he helped another unidentified 
trader earn 5000 by filling a customer order from the dean witter 
reynolds brokerage firm at a higher price than the market would 
have dictated 
assistant us attorney james fleissner said fuhrman did the 
trader a favor in hopes of getting a good turn later 
fuhrman agreed and said he knew what he did was illegal 
walsh and fuhrman face prison terms of up to six years and fines 
of up to 350000 but fleissner said their cooperation would be 
considered they also could face disciplinary action from the 
internal revenue service and the commodities futures trading 
commission 
both were released on 4500 personal recognizance bonds 
mosky also was released under those terms but agreed that if he 
sells his seat on the exchange he must keep the proceeds in escrow 
pending the outcome of the trial 
so far 12 traders from the japanese yen pit at the merc have 
pleaded innocent and three have pleaded guilty

five hundred industrial plants account for 
most of the toxic chemical releases reported to the government and 
a third of the 103 billion pounds of hazardous wastes come from 
only 24 plants a conservation group said thursday 
the national wildlife federation analysis of government toxic 
release statistics said that the biggest polluters the toxic 
500 were scattered in 44 states 
the dozen largest producers of toxic wastes each releasing more 
than 100 million pounds buried them on site or nearby or used a 
procedure of deep injection into the earth prompting the 
conservation group to raise concerns about possible contamination 
to groundwater 
industry representatives have defended such procedures as being 
safe 
according to the report the 500 facilities released or buried 
75 billion pounds of toxic wastes during 1987 more than 70 
percent of the total releases reported to the environmental 
protection agency last year under a new disclosure requirement that 
covered some 18000 facilities 
the raw epa figures were made public in june but no 
plantbyplant breakdown was given along the lines of the 
federations report though the information was available in 
electronic form in epas open computer files 
using the government statistics and databank the wildlife 
federation tabulated a list of the biggest polluters in a 480page 
report entitled the toxic 500 
according to the report about 35 billion pounds of toxic 
wastes were produced by only 24 plants with a dozen facilities 
each reporting the disposal usually into the ground of more 
than 100 million pounds of toxics a total of 118 plants reported 
releases of at least 10 million pounds of toxic chemicals and each 
the 500 polluters reported releases of at least 26 million pounds 
the releases which are usually legal included more than 300 
different chemicals and metals 39 of which are considered 
carcinogenic or cancercausing 
the biggest polluter on the list was the alcoa plant in point 
comfort texas which reported 465 million pounds of toxic wastes 
in 1987 almost all of it aluminum oxide buried at the facility 
another alcoa plant in rockdale texas was no 3 with 329 million 
pounds of buried aluminum oxide 
the national steel corp plant great lakes division in ecorse 
mich had the second largest volume of wastes also aluminum 
oxide the company report it buried the 423 million pounds of waste 
within a few miles of the facility 
while ground disposal practices have been defended by industry 
as safe authors of the wildlife federation report said the debris 
poses longterm concerns about groundwater contamination 
according to the wildlife federation the plant with the most 
toxic emissions into the air was amax magnesium of rowley utah 
which reported spewing out 68 million tons of toxics mostly 
chlorine in 1987 the plant was no 22 in the overall toxic 
release ranking 
five companies reported releasing at least 30 million pounds of 
toxics into the air 
three louisiana plants ranked at the top of the list of 
facilities that discharged large amounts of toxics into surface 
water 
two agrico chemical co plants in uncle sam and 
donaldsonville la were ranked no 1 and no 3 in water 
pollution disposing 59 million pounds and 44 million pounds of 
chemicals respectively mostly phosphoric acid the arcadian corp 
of geismar la ranked second with 54 million pounds of mostly 
phosphoric and sulfuric acid 
jerry poje one of the authors of the study said the analysis 
also showed a surprising volume of toxic wastes being discharged 
into public treatment systems along with other sewage 
according to the study the facilities in the st louis area 
reported the largest volume of toxics released into public sewer 
systems 
columbian chemical co of st louis reported releasing nearly 
49 million pounds of toxics mostly ammonia sulfate into public 
treatement systems in nearby st clair county in illinois the 
monsanto co reported putting 338 million pounds of toxics into a 
public waste treatement system from its sauget chemical plant 
the study said 100 facilities dumped 550 million pounds of toxic 
chemicals into sewer systems nationwide 
kennecott utah copper the mining company owned by british 
petroleum accounts for the largest amount of toxic metal waste 
most of it copper but also arsenic chrome barium and zinc 
compounds most of the 158 million pounds of wastes are buried on 
kennecott property 
eastman kodak co in rochester ny reported the discharge 
more than 9 million pounds of chemicals believed to cause cancer 
pfizer pigments inc of east st louis ill was right behind 
with 82 million pounds a breakdown of the biggest polluters of 
cancercausing substances had been made public previously 
aluminum oxide was by far the most widely produced toxic waste 
among the biggest polluters the industry has petitioned the epa to 
take aluminum oxide off its toxic substance list claiming it poses 
no chronic health risks but opponents of such a move argue it is 
harmful to the respiratory system and possibly linked to brain 
damage 
no decision has been made by the epa

whether drexel burnham lambert inc and the former owner of lincoln 
savings amp loan manipulated the thrift for their own benefit

insurance corp are examining the relationship between american 
continental corp and drexel as part of an investigation of 
lincolns collapse the orange county register reported in 
thursdays editions 
the federal agencies now jointly manage irvine califbased

memorandum indicating that regulators are examining 
new yorkbased drexels purchase of more than 10 percent of 
american continental stock without telling savings and loan 
regulators 
american continentals employee stock ownership plan which 
bought the stake back from the investment firm for 12 million 
esop purchases of stock from various insiders have been criticized 
by the bank board and holders of the uninsured notes as a way for 
insiders to dump the stock at artificially high prices

that lincoln held those shares were then passed from lincoln to 
its parent company which made a 9 million profit according to 
the memorandum

with american continental the register said
