mexico 
george bush may try to run away from his running mate but he 
really cant hide said bentsen who called the selection of 
quayle a big mistake 
while the republicans are running from the issues and running 
from dan quayle we dont intend to let them change the tune were 
going to see that they face the music bentsen said 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis has been facing 
the music in texas on the issues of crime and gun control in a 
barrage of republican ads portraying him as a coddler of criminals 
who wants to disarm honest citizens bentsen attacked what he said 
were distortions of dukakis record and said texas would see 
through them 
texans wont buy a bill of goods on gun control from a man who 
wanted to sell hawk missiles to the ayatollah he said 
bentsen denied republican assertions that the democrats had 
given up onwnnning the south 
that is obviously not true it sounds like some of his 
comments during the debate not true at all he said 
i was in north carolina the other day and they tell me were 
ahead there i was in tennessee they said thats a dead heat i 
think were ahead in arkansas weve seen a nice improvement here 
in texas where the momentum is back in our direction he said 
citing a recent poll showing the ticket only five points behind 
bentsen also discussed his relationship with the late president 
john f kennedy which some have questioned since bentsen said that 
they were friends he said that during the debate just before 
telling quayle he was no jack kennedy 
bentsen who served in the house with kennedy said he was the 
massachusetts senators finance chairman in houston when kennedy 
ran for presidw he also said he received from kennedy an 
inscribed copy of his pulitzer prizewinning book profiles in 
courage 
kennedy invited him to his wedding bentsen said but he was 
already scheduled to make a speech in south texas and missed it 
if i had knorhe was going to be president id have gone 
he said

when sen edward kennedys son was undergoing 
cancer treatment the senator was absent from the capitol for three 
days every three weeks for two years he didnt lose his job 
when sen joseph biden ddel had surgery that laid him up for 
months he didnt lose his job either 
kennedy dmass used those examples to underscore why 
democrats will be back next year pressing for a parental and 
medical leave bill that died friday along with a major child care 
initiative 
these two items will be top priorities in the next senate 
kennedy said 
backers of the two family bills failed friday to get the 60 
votes they needed to limit debate and complete action on the 
measure the vote was 5046 
the package which also included a crackdown on child 
pornographers was on the floor for the better part of two weeks 
amid intense political and parliamentary maneuvering 
supporters found some solace in the heightened visibility of 
their causes 
it was an extraordinarily wonderful job of educating both 
members of the congress and the american public said judith 
lichtman executive director of the womens legal defense fund 
sen christopher dodd dconn sponsor of the child care and 
parental leave bills said he would reintroduce them on the first 
day of the 101st congress in january 
accusing republicans of waging a filibuster by silence he 
declared the stonewall prevailed they defeated the american 
family but were not going to lose forever were going to win 
these issues 
rep pat schroeder dcolo sponsor of the parental leave bill 
in the house said the senate vote marked the beginning of the 
fight and predicted supporters would have renewed strength next 
year 
the senates got to learn that you cant keep playing with 
family issues she said people are going to be angry that 
theres been such a high level of rhetoric and so little produced 
but the groups who fended off the parentalleave and childcare 
provisions this year vowed to be back in force next year as well 
this was round one but it was very much indicative what the 
proponents of child care and parental leave will face in the 
future theyre going to face a battle again and again not only 
from the business community but from groups like ours said 
elizabeth kepley a lobbyist for concerned women for america 
she said the conservative groups nearly halfmillion members 
are active in every congressional district in the nation 
the three elements of the family package included 
dodds original bill requiring employers of more than 50 people 
to offer workers at least 10 weeks of unpaid jobprotected leave 
when they have newborn newly adopted or sick children or have 
serious medical problems themselves 
an antipornography initiative sponsored by sen strom 
thurmond rsc which creates new crimes and punishments for 
those who possess sell or distribute child pornography or obscene 
materials it was added to the parental leave bill on a unanimous 
vote 
the 25 billion act for better child care services also 
sponsored by dodd aimed at helping lowincome parents pay for 
child care at centers or homes it was presented as a compromise 
between dodd and sen orrin hatch rutah and was to have included 
a tax credit for poor families in its final form 
republicans maintained congress had more pressing matters to 
deal with such as drug and tax bills and refused to offer 
amendments or strike a compromise on the family bills 
what weve done in effect is say slow down said republican 
leader bob dole of kansas this isnt an urgent measure that 
needs to be passed in the waning days of the 100th congress

educators addressing the nations top 
business leaders say both presidential candidates have failed to 
fulfill their promises to make education a priority of their 
campaigns 
republican george bush has said he wants to be known as the 
education president and democrat michael dukakis has said no 
issue means more to me 
however over the past year theres been a strange silence 
said ernest l boyer president of the carnegie foundation for the 
advancement of teaching a few little pieces have come along 
revolving mainly around college loans and grants but i have not 
seen a coherent program from either candidate 
i am disappointed with the lack of a sense of urgency said 
marian wright edelman president of the childrens defense fund 
which takes a liberal approach to family issues 
never have we heard so much discussion but the proof of the 
pudding is in the concrete proposals the willingness to invest 
she said 
boyer edelman and other education leaders spoke friday during 
private sessions of the business council composed of 62 chief 
executives of the countrys biggest companies they talked with 
reporters afterward 
the executives were gathered for their twiceayear meeting in 
this resort town in the mountains of western virginia 
albert shanker president of the 665000member american 
federation of teachers said he agreed that neither candidate had a 
welldeveloped education program but he said he preferred dukakis 
to bush because the republican tilts toward providing federal 
assistance to private schools 
for us thats a life and death difference if you move away 
from the public schools thats abandoning the major institution 
we have in our society for improvement of education he said 
however former delaware gov pete du pont who ran 
unsuccessfully for the republican presidential nomination said 
bush should more strongly emphasize using free market competition 
to improve education 
the school system is terrified of competition they have a 
government monopoly they dont have to compete for their kids why 
would they want to change the problem is of course theyre 
giving everyone a lousy education he said 
both boyer and edelman said they were encouraged that business 
leaders recognized educations importance to the future of the 
country 
they are voices that are listened to by politicians theyre 
not going to listen to a third grade teacher they are going to 
listen to the president of a major corporation even the president 
of the united states will answer a phone call from the people in 
this conference boyer said 
also scheduled to speak to the business executives finishing a 
twoday conference today were paul volcker a forme chairman of the 
federal reserve board commerce secretary c william verity sen 
lawton chiles dfla and rep william gray dpa the chairmen 
of the congressional budget committees and drew lewis and robert 
s strauss the cochairmen of a blueribbon commission studying 
the budget deficit 
the council formed in 1933 as an advisory panel to the 
department of commerce selected roger b smith chairman of 
general motors corp to serve as its chairman in 1989 and 1990 he 
replaces sd bechtel jr chairman of bechtel group inc a

pressure on panama trying to force gen manuel antonio noriega to 
resign as the defense forces commander and as such panamas de 
facto ruler 
noriega is under us indictment on drug trafficking and money 
laundering charges which he denies when president eric arturo 
delvalle tried to fire noriega last february delvalle himself was 
dismissed by the noriegacontrolled national assembly 
the reagan administration still recognizes delvalle as panamas 
legitimate president us economic sanctions have helped push 
panamas economy into its worst depression since the 1930s 
under election code changes approved by the assembly in august 
mayoral elections were eliminated in 68 towns and cities beginning 
in 1989 the president will appoint mayors 
the changes also require public officeholders who are 
presidential candidates to resign three months before the election 
noriega has given no indication whether he plans to resign as 
defense forces commander and run for president as standardbearer 
of the governing democratic revolutionary party 
since a military coup in 1968 the presidency has been a 
ceremonial post dominated by the armed forces nicolas ardito 
barletta ran as the government candidate and won the presidential 
election in 1984 the first in 16 years he resigned under pressure 
in 1985 over differences with the defense forces 
with the militarys support delvalle succeeded barletta 
the opposition has not yet said whether it will take part in the 
election

panamanian party the christian democratic party the liberal 
republican movement the labor party the republican party and the 
national action party

the full us circuit court of appeals granted the governments 
request for a rehearing of the case by all of its 11 members

president reagan is broadening his campaign 
stump speech to heap praise on besieged republican vice 
presidential candidate dan quayle 
during the latest in a series of campaignstyle trips aimed at 
helping george bush keep the white house in republican hands 
reagan on several occasions friday put quayles name in a favorable 
light this was in addition to the usual reagan plaudits for bush 
the president departed from the text of a dinner speech to tell 
his audience that someone i know and respect came through for us 
and all americans the other night 
i have to say i wasnt surprised reagan said of quayles 
performance in debate with democratic rival lloyd bentsen 
sure the washington establishment was betting against him 
but i can tell you the smart money was riding on a great senator 
by the name of dan quayle he added 
i tell you he got my vote how about you the president 
asked bringing applause from the audience 
reagan had seldom mentioned quayles name in recent campaign 
outings but white house officials were unwilling to talk about the 
apparent change in strategy 
the kind words for quayle on friday started the moment reagan 
left the white house in the morning en route to detroit when he 
made mention of the indiana senator while commenting on the latest 
drop in unemployment figures 
weve talked about the record 70 months of economic expansion 
but these figures tell the real story that people can understand 
he said and thats what george bush and dan quayle stand for and 
its what the administration has worked out for the last eight 
years 
once he arrived in detroit the president continued the 
proquayle statements he had commenced thursday in the wake of 
criticism of the indiana senators performance in wednesdays vice 
presidential debate 
speaking to a luncheon of business executives in macomb county 
reagan said that one things even clearer to me after watching 
the debate wednesday night the bushquayle ticket will continue 
the policies of peace and prosperity that have as dan said made 
this great nation the envy of the world 
then in his address to a 1000aplate fundraising dinner 
reagan repeated that refrain 
the president had talked glowingly of quayle in the days 
immediately following the republican national convention in august 
tossing the senators name prominently into a speech he made aug 
24 in a joint appearance with bush in los angeles 
but reagan in the past few weeks had not alluded to quayle in 
these stump speeches

the fire chief of this southeast ohio 
community says hes relieved that an underground coal fire was 
extinguished before reaching any homes 
we were lucky to get to it in its infancy fire chief tim 
baden said 
thought the eightday fire threatened as many as 30 homes none 
in the town of 5000 people was damaged 
baden said the blaze was extinguished friday after firefighters 
poured water and a synthetic foam into holes bored into the earth 
the fire which covered a 40by40foot area was discovered 
sept 30 when children playing on a hillside poked sticks into the 
ground and saw that the sticks were on fire when they pulled them 
out 
the fire which extended downward four feet burned refuse coal 
that was believed to have come from an unmapped mine abandoned in 
the 1920s 
baden said the fire entered a coal seam and could have burned 
indefinitely had it not been extinguished so soon

there is no index of character so 
sure as the voice british statesman and orator benjamin disraeli 
once said 
if us presidential candidates were judged by that standard 
alone neither republican george bush nor democrat michael dukakis 
would have a chance of winning the election in the view of speech 
pathologist lillian glass 
its about time the candidates begin to work with 
consultants she said they have to realize we dont live in a 
democracy in terms of appearance politicians often are judged by 
how they look and sound not by their policies she said 
ms glass 34 the author of talk to win six steps to a 
successful vocal image has been analyzing the voices of bush and 
dukakis since the early stages of their campaigns 
prior to the republican national convention last july ms glass 
said that bushs highpitched nasal voice negated his strong 
physical presence and made him appear wimpy dukakis she said 
spoke in a monotone and was unemotional 
an election can be lost solely on how you sound ms glass 
said 
both candidates however demonstrated a vastly improved 
speaking style during their first debate on sept 25 she said 
bush is not perfect but hes lost the wimp factor ms 
glass said after the debate noting his slower more methodical 
approach lowerpitch and stronger inflection 
the changes in the vice president for the most part are being 
attributed to the coaching of roger ailes a former new york 
television producer who serves as the campaigns senior media 
advisor in washington 
ailes denied molding bushs image he said any changes are in 
the eyes of the public 
people are starting to view him as a president and not as 
president reagans assistant he said i mean the man is the 
vice president of the united states you dont get there because 
three months ago you decided to do something about your voice 
dukakis has a lot of potential as an orator but has not yet 
mastered a presidential style ms glass said 
he didnt go up as much at the end of sentences like he used 
to she said after the sept 25 debate he had better diction 
and less staccato in his voice 
as for the diction of the vice presidential candidates there is 
no comparison said ms glass 
dukakis best asset is lloyd bentsen she said he blows 
everybody away with his beautiful projection posture and good 
inflection his security and warmth come across 
the texas senator has a takecharge persona that dukakis can 
learn from ms glass said 
indiana sen dan quayle on the other hand comes across 
unsophisticated and twice as wimpy as bush ever did the speech 
therapist said 
hes a goodlooking man with a high nasal voice and that 
doesnt reflect a lot of selfconfidence 
bush looks like a star and is beginning to sound more like a 
star she said if he had a star running mate it would 
certainly help the ticket be more powerful 
ms glass said all the candidates should use reagan as a role 
model 
whether you agree with his politics or not you feel his 
compassion and dedication to the country she said he has a 
very calming effect 
what makes reagan so good 
his excellent posture his body movement how he uses the 
camera ms glass said its his friend when hes angry you 
see it when hes up its reflected in his voice

nicaraguas only opposition newspaper 
la prensa published a government notice in its friday editions 
that condemned what it called the newspapers defamatory 
reporting of the shootings of three labor activists 
the interior ministry notice criticized a la prensa editorial 
thursday that accompanied the texts of two government protests of 
the newspapers reporting of the sunday shootings la prensa 
printed the protests under government order 
fridays notice was an admonition under a new emergency 
law approved by the national assembly on wednesday the president 
can shut down print and broadcast media for the maintenance of 
public order but la prensa was not ordered to close 
the ministry notice said la prensa insists in its defamatory 
campaign of portraying the government of nicaragua as responsible 
for criminal events it accused la prensa of depicting the 
government as generating a climate of threats against all persons 
and organizations that say something against the sandinista party 
in its thursday editorial titled an unjust order without 
right and without reason la prensa said the government protests 
were two precipitous documents that lamentably once again 
incorrectly cite the countrys laws and once again display an 
ignorance of the legal norms that apply to the exercise of freedom 
of expression in nicaragua 
la prensa also said that it is obvious that in recent days 
gangs of uniformed men with weapons only the army has have 
committed brutal crimes that inevitably show common or similar 
elements 
on tuesday la prensa reported three activists with the 
confederation of trade union unity were fatally shot sunday by 
three men wearing sandinista army uniforms in leon about 45 miles 
west of managua the report said the assailants used sovietmade 
ak47 rifles standard issue in the sandinista army 
la prensa identified the slain activists as fernando torres 
alejandro peralta and norberto espinoza it attributed its 
information to alvin guthrie rivers secretarygeneral of the 
antigovernment confederation 
on wednesday the interior ministry said espinoza was a 
sandinista army first lieutenant and that torres was a former 
member of the sandinista police it described sundays episode as a 
common crime

congress is expected to vote next week on 
compromise legislation to ban disposal of sewage sludge in the 
ocean by the nations only remaining ocean dumpers 
the new agreement struck friday by house and senate conferees 
sets a dec 31 1991 deadline for dumping in the atlantic by nine 
authorities in new york and new jersey 
the legislation imposes stiff fines aimed at making the dumping 
exorbitantly expensive and pools the fines to pay for alternatives 
the agreement is tough but fair clearly the end of ocean 
dumping is in sight said rep william hughes dnj the prime 
house sponsor 
this bill is a major step in cleaning up our oceans added 
rep robert roe dnj 
the compromise reconciles differing sludgedumping bills passed 
by the senate in august and by the house earlier this week 
senate and house votes on the compromise are expected wednesday 
president reagan is expected to sign the bill 
some 8 million tons of sludge a year are dumped by the nine 
agencies at a site about 106 miles east of new jersey congress 
closed a site just 12 miles offshore in 1987 
experts differ on the environmental threat posed by the dumping 
of sludge 
the new bill requires dumpers to pay fees of 100 per ton of 
sludge beginning on jan 1 of next year 
any authority still dumping sludge in the ocean by 1993 would 
have to pay penalties in addition to the fees

battered and bought us industries

native new england today visiting bates college in lewiston 
maine on a sentimental stop at the place where his parents 
attended college only a few years after emigrating from greece 
the trip to maine capping a campaign week highlighted by his 
running mate lloyd bentsens debate with dan quayle was bringing 
dukakis to a small state but one the campaign hopes to carry on 
nov 8 despite bushs summer mansion on the coast at 
kennebunkport 
we want to carry all of george bushs home states quipped 
press secretary dayton duncan in a remark lampooning the vice 
presidents loose ties to several states 
the massachusetts governor returned to boston late friday after 
campaigning in missouri and north carolina assailing the reagan 
administrations record on foreign trade and quayles debate remark 
praising foreign investment in us companies for creating jobs 
but the campaign was embarrassed to learn that the moog 
automotive co in wellston mo where dukakis delivered a speech 
blasting the republicans on the foreign investment issue was 
actually owned by an italian automaking conglomerate through a 
us holding company and the company was bought out 11 years ago 
during a democratic administration 
duncan said some in the campaign knew of its ownership but top 
campaign officials did not know and neither did rep richard 
gephardt dmo who accompanied dukakis to the plant dukakiss 
blasts at foreign ownership set off murmers among workers at the 
plant and aides acknowledged dukakis was unaware of the ownership 
when he praised the company and its workers as survivors in the 
fight for american businesses and products 
if anyone asks you whats at stake in this election just 
remind them of that moment in the debate wednesday night when dan 
quayle said hes happy that foreign owners are buying up america 
dukakis said 
maybe the republican ticket wants our children to work for 
foreign owners pay rent to foreign owners and owe their future to 
foreign owners but thats not the kind of future lloyd bentsen and 
i and dick gephardt and all of you want for america he said 
dukakis said bush has spent the last eight years with a do 
not disturb sign hanging on his office door ignoring the trade 
issue 
he said the united states enjoyed a trade surplus of 7 billion 
in 1981 when the reagan administration took over and that by 1987 
the nation suffered a trade deficit of 154 billion 
in the debate quayle said i would rather have people come 
over here and to make investments in this country rather than 
going elsewhere because by coming over here and making 
investments in this country we are seeing jobs 
dukakis borrowed some of the rhetoric of former rivals gephardt 
and jesse jackson from the democratic primaries as he lamented the 
decline of the united states as the leading manufacturer of 
consumer electronics such as color televisons video cassette 
recorders and telephones 
dukakis and bentsen are calling for a new trade policy that they 
say will require reciprocity or prohibiting foreign companies from 
flooding the united states with products when us manufacturers 
are locked out of those countries they also support limited 
restrictions on imports of some foreign products including 
textiles so long as us companies respond by modernizing to 
become competitive 
before heading home dukakis stopped in ashville nc and 
spoke to a crowd of 2000 people jammed around the home of the late 
author thomas wolfe now restored the twostory white frame house 
with stained glass windows which was wolfes mothers boarding 
house that he recalled in the book look homeward angel served 
as dukakis backdrop and he recalled traveling to north carolina in 
1960 fresh out of law school just to visit the house 
dukakis cited a wolfe quotation that approximated the 
candidates own oftenrepeated theme that the best america is 
yet to come and declared the two debates between the democratic 
and republican tickets have changed the complexion of the race 
i think some things happened on that stage and some things 
happened around the country that have made this a brand new 
campaign he said were starting to move folks you can feel 
it

an administrative judge has ruled that a company 
falsely advertised a water purifying device by failing to disclose 
it added a probable carcinogen to the water it filtered a 
newspaper reported today 
last months ruling by james p timothy of the federal trade 
commission said north american philips corp of new york showed 
utter disregard for the welfare of its consumers and blatant 
disregard for the law in marketing its norelco clean water 
machine according to the new york times 
the ftc had filed an administrative complaint against the 
company in august 1987 the complaint said that while ads for the 
machine claimed the product made tap water clean or cleaner they 
failed to disclose that filters formerly used in the product 
actually added a potentially hazardous chemical to the water 
the filters which the company recalled in 1986 added the 
chemical methylene chloride to the water that passed through them 
the complaint said the chemical used as a solvent in glues 
paints and other substances has been shown to cause cancer in 
laboratory animals according to the consumer product safety 
commission 
the company sold 186000 of the filters between 1982 and the 
start of the recall in 1986 the times reported 
the company said distributing the tainted filters was a 
management mistake and that it would not appeal the judges 
decision which would become final after review by the fivemember 
commission according to the newspaper 
we have never had that kind of accident in our 50 years of 
business in north america and we feel it has reflected too 
negatively on our corporation said winfried c vant hoff 
norelco executive vice president 
many of the people involved with this thing are no longer with 
the company said samuel j rozen the companys general counsel

legislation to combat midnight dumping of 
medical wastes has won senate approval and now goes back to the 
house for further action next week 
the bill which was passed in the senate by voice vote friday 
night sets up a system to track infectious waste like that which 
fouled atlantic beaches last summer 
the house approved a similar bill on thursday but now the two 
pieces of legislation must be reconciled before moving toward final 
congressional approval 
spending a day at the beach shouldnt have to be followed by a 
day at the doctor said sen frank lautenberg dnj a sponsor 
of the bill 
senate approval came after several minor changes were made in a 
version that had been passed by the house requiring it to be 
reconsidered by the house next week 
the legislation was prompted by the waves of used syringes 
vials of aidsinfected blood and other hospital waste that washed 
up on beaches along the east coast lake michigan and lake erie 
during the summer the waste became a health problem closing some 
beaches because of the threat of hepatitis and other diseases 
the bill would require the environmental protection agency to 
set up a system to track dangerous waste from hospitals labs and 
clinics to its disposal initially the program would cover just 10 
states connecticut new jersey new york pennsylvania ohio 
indiana illinois michigan wisconsin and minnesota 
later the program could be made national in scope if other 
states petition to subject their medical waste to the same 
cradletograve monitoring system for medical supplies 
included in the papertrail tracking system would be blood 
hypodermic needles scalpels and surgical and laboratory waste that 
has been in contact with infectious agents they would have to be 
segregated from other medical waste and tracked to make sure they 
reached a proper disposal facility 
the problem has received substantial publicity this year after 
fouled stretches of beach in new york and new jersey were closed 
ruining vacations and causing lost revenues for oceanside 
businesses and resorts 
lautenberg said the waste problem appears to be the result of 
illegal dumpers who threaten the wellbeing of their fellow 
citizens to save a few dollars in disposal costs 
lawmakers criticized the epa which they said has had authority 
to regulate the wastes but has ignored the problem

a catchall package of special tax benefits 
that has been two years in the making faces a new challenge because 
of efforts to protect the site of one of the civil wars bloodiest 
battles 
on a 5025 vote friday night the senate attached to the tax 
bill an amendment by sen dale bumpers dark that would seize 
540 acres of land on which the second battle of manassas was fought 
in 1862 the aim of the provision which the house already has 
approved would be to block development of a shopping mall on the 
land 
interior secretary donald p hodel has said he would recommend 
that president reagan veto any legislation to which the amendment 
was attached 
you are asking the senate to follow you in a picketts charge 
to the presidents veto pen sen john warner rva told 
bumpers 
but without his amendment bumpers said the promontory where 
confederate gen robert e lee had his headquarters during the 
battle will be paved over and i can see a big granite statue in 
that mall with the inscription general lee stood on this 
spot bumpers said 
in siding with bumpers the senate turned down a substitute plan 
by warner which would have allowed the federal government to take 
80 acres of the privately owned land and allow housing construction 
on adjacent areas 
debate over the manassas amendments and several other nontax 
proposals delayed final action on the bill whose main purpose is 
to correct errors and clear up confusion arising from the big 1986 
tax overhaul the senate finance committee already has attached to 
the measure dozens of special tax benefits worth about 276 
billion plus the assorted tax increases necessary to pay for them 
the package includes a bill of rights for taxpayers involved 
in disputes with the internal revenue service the bill relieves 
farmers from the federal tax on diesel used for offroad purposes 
and from the heifer tax on livestockproduction expenses 
other beneficiaries include freelance artists corporate 
investments in research firsttime homebuyers contributors to 
college athletic funds and workers who receive employerfinanced 
legal or education aid 
the senate has agreed to a final vote on the bill tuesday night 
but only after considering another two dozen amendments 
congressional leaders hope negotiators can then work out a 
compromise between the senate bill and the 75 billion version 
already approved by the house 
the tax bill is one of two major measures standing in the way of 
adjourning the 100th congress the other contains tools to fight 
drug abuse for that reason senators know that if they have any 
hope of getting a pet project approved in the closing days of the 
session it will have to be tacked onto the tax bill 
at nightfall friday more than 100 amendments were waiting to be 
considered and majority leader robert c byrd dwva was not 
pleased this list is crazy nuts and getting crazier all the 
time byrd said we ought to settle down and get our senses 
within two hours byrd announced senators had agreed to drop all 
but 29 
this is the typical tax bill said republican leader bob 
dole of kansas everybody cleans out their desks and their trash 
cans and says well put it on the tax bill weve reached the 
point that if somebody doesnt take the bull by the horns well

when it comes to forecasting the 
weather just give helen lane a woolly worm and a corn husk 
i think itll get a little warmer before it gets cold again 
and give us some real nice days in november was her 
pronouncement this week on helen lane day in crab orchard a town 
60 miles west of knoxville 
the 68yearold prognosticator considered generally accurate 
for the past 29 years predicted two heavy snowfalls for the coming 
winter 
mrs lane has been making predictions since 1959 when her 
warnings of a harsh winter were followed by 28 storms and more than 
6 feet of snow 
dont say you werent warned was the headline in the 
crossville chronicle which published her predictions that autumn 
people have paid attention to her assessment of woolly worms 
corn husks and the number of dense august fogs ever since the 
darker the woolly worms and the thicker the husks the more severe 
the winter will be she says 
this will be a generally cold dry winter she said thursday 
there could be more snow than the two storms she said but it 
wont amount to much 
mrs lane learned her methods from her father who in turn 
absorbed the lessons handed down from previous generations

the biggest fish story of the 
week to come out of lake hemet lost some of its teeth when a 
fishermans catch turned out to be a vegetarian pacu instead of a 
flesheating piranha 
the unusual fish was hooked by a fullerton man monday and rumors 
quickly spread that the perchshaped creature with lots of teeth 
was a piranha 
i called a state biologist because id never seen a piranha 
other than in books and movies said chief ranger jim henry of the 
lake hemet municipal water district 
henry froze the fish for examination by biologist frank hoover 
the report that came back wednesday from the state department of 
fish and game said the fish was actually a pacu a vegetableeating 
creature in the same family as the piranha a native of south 
america the pacu probably wouldnt have survived the winter in the 
lake in the san jacinto mountains about 50 miles east of los 
angeles 
henry also went back to the small lake thursday to squelch the 
rumors among the lakes fishermen 
state law prohibits importation or possession of piranha but it 
doesnt apply to the pacu 
i think somebody is just letting them loose kind of like 
people who start forest fires to sit back and watch hoover said

two years ago an activist group described 
a near catastrophe at the savannah river nuclear plant in 1965 but 
the report largely went unnoticed 
this week the incident was detailed by the new york times 
proving the activists say that they are not the kooks theyve 
been called for years 
im glad that people are beginning to pay attention said 
francis close hart chairwoman of the south carolina energy 
foundation a natural resource policy and education group weve 
been saying this kind of thing for a long time 
officials of du pont co the plants operator insisted friday 
that the us government plant the nations sole producer of 
weaponsgrade plutonium and tritium is safe 
we believe these facilities are safe otherwise we would not 
operate these facilities we have never had an accident that has 
put the community around us or our employees at risk said jim 
felder manager of public relations for du pont at the sprawling 
operation in aiken near the georgia line 
du pont president edgar s woolard sent a telegram to four us 
senators friday saying the company welcomed their call for a review 
of the plants operations following a congressional hearing in 
which the us energy department disclosed 30 serious mishaps that 
previously were kept secret 
the new york times story based on a memo found in a public 
document room at the university of south carolina in aiken said 
some cooling water leaked in a reactor and a foreman wanted to 
close valves that limit the cooling water supply 
the foremans senior supervisor prevented the valves from being 
closed narrowly averting disaster according to the du pont 
engineer who wrote the memo 
the foundations report two years ago quoted the same engineer 
and said closing the valves would have caused the reactor to 
destroy itself 
ms hart said the times story was the most dramatic example 
she knew of the popular press catching up with news her group has 
reported 
im not one to say i told you so said michael lowe a 
nuclear specialist with the environmental group greenpeace on 
the other hand im glad were able to say i told you so now 
instead of when one of these accidents get out of hand 
though activists have for the last decade pointed to problems at 
the plant theyve learned during the past two weeks more details 
about safety problems there 
michael clark president of the washingtonbased environmental 
policy institute a nonprofit environmental research and advocacy 
group said his group used the federal freedom of information act 
to obtain 50000 pages of information about the plant 
but he said that information only revealed two of the 30 
serious mishaps listed in a document made public by the federal 
energy department at the congressional hearing a week ago 
we are now wondering what else is going on there that the 
public hasnt been told about he said its a rogue operation 
its out of control about 100 protesters have been arrested at 
the plant during the last decade according to leaders of the grass 
roots organizing workshop a group based in columbia that organized 
the major protests at the plant 
its clear that people who had been calling us kooks 10 years 
ago are now saying the same thing we were about the safety 
problems said brett bursey the groups director

most peshtigo fire museum visitors never 
heard of north americas deadliest fire which erupted 117 years 
ago today and killed 1150 people but was overshadowed by the 
famous chicago conflagration 
a lot of tourists go through here and it surprises me most 
people are unaware of the tragedy said stella van bogart a 
museum curator the museums been open 25 years and this still 
goes on 
its something that people around here remember its taught 
in elementary school classes said peshtigo school superintendent 
george fox 
still even in this northeast wisconsin community of about 
3000 the anniversary will go unmarked 
the small museum housed in a church built after the blaze has 
only a tabernacle and a few charred pieces of wood to memorialize 
the inferno next to the church is a graveyard where a stone marks 
a mass grave for about 350 unidentified victims 
ed kautz of the us forest service said the peshtigo fire 
remains the blaze with the highest known death toll on the 
continent it also is the worlds seconddeadliest blaze surpassed 
only by an 1845 fire at a theater in canton china killing 1670 
according to the world almanac 
the fire helped spur the development of many firefighting and 
conservation techniques still used today said kautz and state 
forest firefighting specialists 
fueled and spread by a tornado the inferno killed at least 
1150 people burned about 128 million acres of pine forest in 
eight counties and caused 5 million in damage not counting lost 
timber 
but the fire that destroyed peshtigo which took 30 years to 
rebuild has become a footnote in history to a smaller fire on the 
same day oct 8 1871 the famous chicago fire erupted it killed 
250 people during its fourday rampage 
a drought parched northeastern wisconsin most of the summer and 
fall of 1871 despite that loggers continued to clear the land 
leaving slash and other debris in continuously burning piles 
railroad workers extending track and farmers clearing land also 
piled or burned debris for acres 
as many townspeople were returning from an evening church 
service or eating supper the fire began 
historian stewart h holbrook wrote a southwest wind blew 
flurries of white ashes on the town like a snowstorm then 
townspeople heard what sounded like the rumble of a train and then 
a roar as the fiery tornado descended on it 
pine sidewalks and houses were ablaze when a rush of galeforce 
wind sent sheets of fire onto the town from the red glowing sky 
the tornadoswept fire was preceded by blinding smoke about 300 
people were killed on a wooden bridge after they ran onto it to 
flee the blaze but it collapsed and burned some were wedged 
between the burning logs in the water 
the intense wind blew fire like a blow torch from the banks to 
burn the heads of people who sought safety in neckdeep peshtigo 
river 
so many people were burned to ashes that teeth often were the 
only way to distinguish animals from man survivors said 
others were killed by the tornado suffocated after seeking 
refuge in wells or were trampled by terrified cattle 
in one case a father slit the throats of his four children and 
wife and then himself to spare them a burning death 
historical accounts indicated the fire lasted an hour in 
peshtigo from 9 pm to 10 pm before moving on to other 
villages historians estimate that about 800 of peshtigos 1700 
residents were killed and at least 350 in the other communities 
died about 1500 people were badly injured and 3000 were left 
homeless 
no one knew of the peshtigo fire for days because telegraph 
poles had burned down almost a month earlier in other small brush 
fires help did not reach victims for several days

police in jeeps and trucks broke up a 
gathering of 2000 people when a satiric dissident group tried to 
hold a demonstration to defend communism at a monument to the 
founder of the soviet secret police 
about 50 people were arrested friday by uniformed and 
plainclothed police who started seizing demonstrators and checking 
their identity papers even before the rally was to begin at 3 pm 
at a busy central plaza 
the rally was organized by the orange alternative a movement 
which has gained popularity among young people in recent years with 
its happenings that poke fun at authorities the movement is 
based in the southwestern city of wroclaw 
you have two minutes to disperse no jokes any more go 
home police said over loudspeakers before driving jeeps and 
trucks through the crowd huddled along sidewalks accross from the 
busy square demonstrators chanted kgb and solidarity 
scuffles broke out as police chased demonstrators who darted in 
front of oncoming trams and rushhour traffic to avoid detention 
demonstrators blew plastic whistles and jeered at the police who 
formed cordons and shoved the crowd into adjacent side streets 
one policeman bloodied his face after tripping on the pavement 
while chasing a fleeing youth police refrained from using their 
truncheons but tried to control the size of the crowd by refusing 
to let people get out of arriving trams 
protesters took shelter after the police moved in rushing away 
from the oncoming police vehicles into shops adjoining the plaza 
and a minor brawl erupted in one shoestore when officers tried to 
seize a banner carried by three youths 
some demonstrators including women and old people were roughed 
up or pulled by the hair while being detained 
it took the police more than two hours to clear the square 
the rally was held at dzierzynski square named after feliks 
dzierzynski a polish supporter of the bolshevik revolution who in 
1918 founded the cheka the secret police organization that was the 
forerunner of todays kgb 
the protest coincided with the officially proclaimed 
policemans day in poland earlier in the day a police 
delegation placed flowers and polish flags at the bottom of the 
monument 
organizers had put up colorful orangelettered posters at warsaw 
university and distributed leaflets throughout the city announcing 
the rally police began patrolling the square early friday morning 
a spokesman for the independent student association known by 
its polish initials nzs said police detained five people thursday 
night in advance of the rally and four others received telephone 
warnings not to participate 
in june about 1000 orange alternative supporters held mock 
elections and lampooned various government officials in warsaw on 
the day of nationwide municipal elections police did not interfere

a new screening test that is more accurate 
safer and far less expensive than existing ones for prenatal 
detection of downs syndrome could be available for widespread use 
in two or three years researchers say 
if the test were given to every pregnant woman in the united 
states it could catch 60 percent of the estimated 5000 cases that 
occur annually compared with the maximum 20 percent detection rate 
possible with existing tests the researchers say 
downs syndrome is the nations most common disorder of the 
chromosomes the microscopic threads in each cell that carry 
genes which govern hereditary characteristics 
downs syndrome is characterized by mental retardation a broad 
face and slanting eyes 
the existing test uses a procedure called amniocentesis in 
which a small amount of the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus is 
withdrawn and fetal cells in the fluid are examined for the 
presence of chromosomal defects 
the procedure costs about 1000 and leads to miscarriages in 
about one in 200 mothers who receive it doctors said 
the new test done by measuring the levels of three substances 
in the mothers bloodstream identifies women at highest risk of 
having children with downs syndrome said one of the authors of 
the study jacob canick a biochemist at brown university and women 
and infants hospital both in providence ri 
the other authors include dr james haddow of the foundation for 
blood research in scarborough maine and dr nicholas wald of the 
medical college of st bartholomews hospital in london 
in the absence of such a test doctors assess risk based only on 
the mothers age the older the mother the higher the risk the 
new test provides a much more accurate assessment of risk canick 
said in a telephone interview friday 
the researchers measured three substances to assess risk 
alphafetoprotein estriol and human chorionic gonadotropin all 
made by the fetus or placenta and carried in the mothers 
bloodstream risk of downs syndrome was linked to low levels of 
alphafetoprotein and estriol and high levels of human chorionic 
gonadotropin in the mothers blood said haddow 
the test will probably cost 50 to 60 and because it is a 
simple blood test done on the mother it carries no risk of 
miscarriage canick said 
in the study the test was done on mothers during the second 
trimester of pregnancy when amniocentesis is usually performed 
prenatal detection of a birth defect could lead a physician to 
recommend abortion 
in a study reported in the current issue of the british medical 
journal canick and his colleagues found that the test was accurate 
enough to enable doctors to detect 60 percent of all cases of 
downs syndrome in the united states if it were given to all 
pregnant women 
amniocentesis is now recommended for pregnant women over age 35 
if it were given to all of them it would identify only 20 percent 
of downs syndrome cases canick said 
dr aubrey milunsky director of boston universitys center for 
human genetics said of the findings there is every likelihood 
that this order of efficiency or detection will be attainable its 
likely to be an extremely valuable screening method for prenatal 
detection for not only downs syndrome but also other chromosome 
disorders 
milunsky who was not connected with the study said he will 
shortly publish his own study in the american journal of obstetrics 
and gynecology showing that similar testing can be effective as 
early as the eighth to 12th week of pregnancy 
in may researchers announced that a government study found that 
another method of determining chromosome abnormalities in a fetus 
as early as the eighth week of pregnancy was safe and accurate 
the technique is called chorionic villus sampling using a 
special device a doctor snips off a tiny piece of chorionic villus 
tissue which grows from an enveloping membrane that eventually 
gives rise to the placenta the tissue which is genetically 
identical to the fetus is then tested for abnormalities

the british designer show opened with a burst of 
color a breath of eastern adventure and a boost from prime 
minister margaret thatcher 
if the 300 designers exhibiting at the fourday show have their 
way next summers look will be soft shapely leggy and exotic 
with a bit of the zany eccentricity that has become a british 
fashion hallmark 
its going to be brights and colors said designer benny 
ong i think women have now come to realize that color is no 
longer an apology for being themselves its like a coming out 
party for women so long live color 
added david sassoon who designs for most of the british royals 
i think its a softer more fluid look away from the 
constructed dresses of last season 
sandwiched between the milan and paris shows london has become 
an important stopping off point for buyers in the last five years 
especially those looking for something different organizers expect 
6000 buyers by the tie the show which opened friday concludes on 
monday 
france is a wonderful seduction italy is healthy and always 
good and england is more of the adventure and the whimsy said 
bernie ozer vice president of new yorks associated merchandising 
corp the worlds largest international marketing and buying 
service whose clients range from harrods to bloomingdales 
the london fashion showcase has been a crucial selling platform 
for the british clothing industry whose exports increased from 
17 billion in 1984 to 243 billion in 1987 
mrs thatcher an avid backer of british trade held a reception 
for top designers and buyers at her official 10 downing st

a sneak preview revealed a distinct middle eastern feel in his 
prints mixed with kaftanstitched linens and striped pyjamas 
but the london message seems to be coming from further east in 
malaysia singapore and india the sarong is the skirt for summer 
and there are several filmy sarilike shawls and wraps 
betty jackson used the atmosphere of indonesia for her printed 
and sequinned sarong skirts edina ronay who designs for the 
duchess of york also featured sarongs and arabella pollen a 
favorite of princess diana used the sarong as the main skirt for 
her collection 
its a sort of fake sarong ms pollen said its a nice 
safe sarong it actually fits quite nicely in the back and the 
sarong is an extra piece i hate those sarongs where when you shift 
your leg the whole thing moves 
washed silks from the east were also popular with betty jackson 
arabella pollen and workers for freedom one of londons young 
design teams they featured a summer eskimos collection of 
burnt orange and indigo tiedye washable silk offoneshoulder

the owner of the idled shoreham nuclear power 
plant on new yorks long island has vowed to fight an appeals board 
ruling taking away authorization for the plant to receive a 
fullpower operating license 
we will appeal the decision directly to the nuclear 
regulatory commission jim lois a spokesman for long island 
lighting co said friday 
lois was reacting to a ruling friday by a threejudge panel of 
the atomic safety and licensing appeals board that a licensing 
panel did not have the authority to remove state and local 
governments as intevenors in the case 
as a result the appeals board said all outstanding emergency 
planning issues had not been resolved in the shoreham case and the 
basis for the fullpower license authorization does not exist 
on sept 23 a threejudge panel of the atomic safety and 
licensing board threw out new york state suffolk county and the 
town of southampton as intervenors in a case involving an emergency 
evacuation drill conducted at shoreham the panel also found that 
there was reasonable assurance that the publics safety could be 
protected in the event of an accident at the reactor 
both the appeal board and the licensing panel are part of the 
nuclear regulatory commission 
state and local authorities have refused to participate in 
emergency planning at the reactor which has been completed since 
1984 but has never operated they maintain that long island could 
not be safely evacuated in an emergency 
current federal regulation prevents the nrc from issuing a 
fullpower license to a nuclear plant unless there is an emergency 
plan that gives reaasonable assurance the public will be safe if an 
accident occurs 
francis sheehan a spokesman for new york gov mario cuomo said 
the governor had no immediate comment on the court decision

radio city no longer has a radio station 
with tears memories and voices from the past wnbc went off 
the air friday after 62 years of broadcasting that included the 
first commercial the comedy of jack benny and bob hope and the 
conducting of arturo toscanini 
we have a very big supply of tissues here at the studio 
said alan colmes host of the last radio show from the nbc studios 
in rockefeller center which inspired the name of the neighboring 
radio city music hall a sportstalk station took over the 660 spot 
on the am dial 
its historic but sad colmes said there is something 
about this building maybe a radio muse that makes everything so 
special the list of people who have been fired from this station 
is a whos who of radio 
at the end of fridays show everyone in the studio counted down

commercial and got an unexpected laugh 
and for a limited time just mention wnbc and youll get a 
free mattress cover make that very limited colmes cracked

fourteenyearold ray bateman jr is almost a 
typical american teenager except for his preoccupation with 
finding a cure for colon cancer 
ray collaborated with cancer researcher dr glen tisman and 
delivered their test results friday to the american federation for 
clinical research 
ray has tremendous scientific gifts that come naturally 
tisman said after watching the teenager deliver the slide show and 
speech in a steady if squeaky voice 
this started as a school project but obviously got much 
bigger said ray flashing a bracebedecked smile after the 
presentation 
the huntington beach calif computer whiz received two rounds 
of applause from a group of two dozen researchers 
i think it was very exciting said dr mark moskowitz of 
newton mass who attended the presentation we need more young 
investigators he could be the first of a new generation of 
medical researchers 
ray was accompanied to the convention by his parents and tisman 
the pair worked together on a plan to combine a chemical 
5fluorodeoxyuridine 5fudr for short with a vitamin derivative 
in an effort to kill cancer cells the teenager said 
both agreed the plan needed additional testing although initial 
indicators showed it had potential in fighting cancer 
ray delivered the research because the research federations 
rules state that if two authors submit a paper and one is older 
than 41 the younger one must make the presentation tisman is 46 
he recruited ray to assist in doing computer analyses of his 
research 
what ray has done here is make the whole thing possible 
tisman said 
ray who spent an estimated 1300 hours on the research said he 
hoped to continue work on the therapy and start a career in 
medicine the teenagers parents say they have spent 25000 on 
computers 
i would like to be involved in something both research and 
clinical ray said i dont think it would be all that much fun 
to do research and not see it applied

a member of the grand jury that 
rejected tawana brawleys story of abduction and rape by a gang of 
whites said no evidence whatsoever supported the black teenagers 
tale 
this thing wasnt a mere preponderance of evidence said 
anthony montanari it was all the evidence that pointed to the 
conclusion that we drew 
but jimmy powell one of two black members of the 23member 
grand jury that disbanded friday after probing the case since feb 
29 said he was unconvinced the 16yearold was lying he said he 
opposed the vote to accept the 170page report 
the evidence wasnt there to support the conclusion powell 
said friday 
he said he wasnt the only grand juror to disagree with the 
report but wouldnt give any more details about the deliberations 
the report flatly stated miss brawley had not been sexually 
assaulted it said all evidence suggested that the teenager found 
last nov 28 with racial epithets and dog feces smeared on her 
body had inflicted the condition on herself 
miss brawley who said she was abducted for four days was found 
in a garbage bag outside her familys former apartment in 
wappingers falls 75 miles north of new york city 
state supreme court judge angelo ingrassia who ordered the 
report released to the public said the grand jurys conclusions 
were beyond a reasonable doubt 
timothy gilles spokesman for attorney general robert abrams 
said abrams wouldnt comment on the grand jury deliberations grand 
jury reports do not have to be unanimous the new york daily news 
reported the vote was 221 
montanari refused to discuss the panels final vote saying he 
feared hed be guilty of a crime 
montanari said evidence linking charred cloth used to scrawl the 
slurs kkk and nigger on the girls body to fibers found 
under miss brawleys fingernails proved to be crucial in clinching 
the case 
that was very very revealing he said 
but he said that testimony from miss brawley who refused to 
cooperate with the grand jury on the advice of her advisers would 
have made a difference 
theres only one person whos sure to know what happened to 
tawana brawley and thats tawana brawley montanari said 
the other black grand juror george pelote who voted to approve 
the report told the daily news we all felt something did happen 
to her but not what was claimed by her 
in chicago the rev al sharpton one of miss brawleys three 
advisers said the girl would appear at a news conference over the 
weekend to discuss the substance of the grand jury findings 
we have information and evidence that is going to rock the 
world said sharpton 
he said the brawley family which now lives in virginia beach 
va had been invited to attend the chicago convention three months 
ago by nation of islam leader louis farrakhan 
we want to sit down with minister farrakhan to go over 
several of the contradictions in the report and make a very 
itemized analysis of it sharpton said

edison dubbed the studio black maria an old slang term for 
a black police paddy wagon which it resembles besides the black 
maria the historic site is home to edisons library laboratory 
research and development complex and victorian mansion 
one of the great things about the site is that edisons 
inventions are here they work visitors can participate and 
touch said fahy whitaker who supervises the sites staff for 
the national park service 
at least 12000 students a year mainly from new jersey tour 
the edison site and learn about filmmaking ms whitaker said

have built the west orange laboratory in 1887 to develop inventions 
quickly and cheaply there he also perfected the phonograph and the 
alkaline battery 
fridays visitors watched as actress ruth warrick of abctvs 
all my children and other volunteers portrayed a scene from 
the great train robbery inside the studio 
the original black tar paper studio a separate building next to

the inventor in 1893 at his west orange laboratory edison tore 
down the first studio in 1903 the reproduction was constructed 50 
years later 
like the original the replica has a roof that opens to provide 
sunlight for filming 
money for the studio renovation was donated by the national tour 
association the largest grouptravel organization in the united 
states 
what we wanted to do is take a site lesser known or lesser 
used in the national park system and focus on it so people 
understand that the national parks are more than yellowstone

authorities hauled away about a dozen leaders of a 
group demanding democratic change during a rally that drew more 
than 1000 people to a city square 
however they let others in the crowd at pushkin square friday 
argue for hours about whether freedom and democracy really exist in 
the soviet union 
what kind of democracy is this onlookers shouted at police 
and paramilitary troops who elbowed and shoved their way into the 
crowd the demonstrators hoisted small signs calling for freedom 
and democracy 
friday was constitution day in the soviet union a national 
holiday a group called the democratic union mounted the protest to 
demand democratic changes 
police hauled away a woman carrying a small child after she 
briefly lifted a sign and began arguing loudly with an elderly man 
we do have freedom in this country the man said 
arent you ashamed she replied gesturing at the police as 
they came to take her away 
the police moved gently for the most part exhorting people 
through megaphones to move on after 45 minutes when the crowd 
had not responded the demands softened to please move on 
a police officer said through the loudspeakers repeatedly the 
peoples deputies have ordered there will be no meeting 
what people said a man in the crowd who was elegantly 
dressed in a gray suit 
at least 10 busloads of police and paramilitary troops were at 
the square in central moscow but fewer than 100 men actually went 
into the crowd 
arguments sprang up among bystanders with some criticizing and 
others defending the government whenever arguments in the square 
evolved into speeches police moved in 
how many in the crowd supported the demonstrators became clear 
when one raised a protest sign half an hour after the initial 
detentions about 50 of the more than 1000 onlookers applauded 
but the rest merely craned their necks to read the sign 
stanislav dergunov a member of the fledgling democratic union 
said the groups main objective was to change article 6 of the 
constitution which gives the communist party a monopoly on power 
in the tense moments following the detentions when no one knew 
whether police would stop after taking the protest leaders 
journalists and police gathered around nikita kirilov 
he carried a 1960s peace sign and a wore a handmade badge with a 
drawing of barbed wire that identified him as a democratic union 
member 
im not holding a demonstration im giving an interview he 
told police 
they left him alone 
col georgy postoyuk the police supervisor on the scene 
finally ordered his men to back off he denied anyone had been 
arrested and declared smiling theyre all here

pope john paul ii began a fourday 
visit to france today and called on europe to unite as a continent 
guided by christian values honoring human dignity and the ideals of 
liberty tolerance and respect for law 
speaking in french to the 21nation council of europe the pope 
said the countries of the old continent should remember their 
common christian heritage and apply it to policy governing family 
life technology education and employment 
the most urgent problem on which all nations should cooperate 
is access to work the pope said 
is it utopian to ask that when decisions of an economic nature 
are made there should be consideration of the trials of those who 
lose through unemployment a part of their dignity and sometimes 
even their strength to hope he asked 
john paul making his fourth visit to france and his 40th 
foreign trip as pope was greeted in a light rain at 
strasbourgentzheim airport by president francois mitterrand who 
spoke in his welcoming remarks of a dream of a unified europe 
about 150 dignitaries were joined at the airport by about 200 
other people including children who waved yellow papal pennants 
and red blue and white french flags 
the pontiff speaking in french said the roman catholic church 
views with satisfaction the efforts made by the european 
countries to tighten still more their bonds and forge a common 
future 
i see it as a matter of urgency that these peoples draw from 
the common wellsprings of the faith and values which are their most 
precious heritage he said 
the popes dc9 alitalia plane left rome just as a strike was 
getting under way at leonardo da vinci airport by pilots flight 
technicians and airport personnel in a dispute over reorganization 
of airport management 
in the past the polishborn pontiff has called on europeans to 
draw together on the basis of their common christian heritage and 
reject unnatural divisions splitting europe into power blocs 
john paul 68 was expected to expand on that theme during 
speeches today to the council of europe and european court of human 
rights and to the european parliament on tuesday all three 
institutions meet at the palace of europe in strasbourg 
his message comes at a time of sharp economic divisions among 
the common market nations the agreement by european economic 
community members to fully integrate their economies in 1992 has 
touched off widespread debate about whether western europe should 
move toward becoming a single political unit 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain provoked protests 
last month when she declared a usstyle european union would be 
highly damaging to the individual states 
the popes visit was timed so he could take part in the 2000th 
anniversary of strasbourg he also has scheduled visits to the 
dioceses of strasbourg metz and nancy all in the northeast near 
west germany 
the council of europe is composed of 21 parliamentary 
democracies that make up nearly all noncommunist europe it aims 
to coordinate european legislation through a series of accords and 
to encourage unity democracy and human rights 
the 39yearold organization has produced 110 conventions on 
subjects ranging from terrorism to wildlife protection the most 
important of them is the european convention on human rights 
unlike the european parliament the council of europe and its 
judicial organs are not related to the european economic community 
or common market

several news reports say anglican church 
envoy terry waite and american hostages will soon be freed but one 
suggested waite may be released only when britain renews ties with 
syria 
one of fridays reports came from a new israeli weekly the 
nation which published an unattributed story saying the united 
states made a deal with iran to free american hostages it said the 
agreement included delivery of weapons and spare parts to iran 
through south korea 
us officials denied the report they have said repeatedly they 
will not bargain with the kidnappers and that no direct talks have 
been held with iran 
a beirut magazine ashshiraa said waite missing since january 
1987 will be freed with two other british hostages 
it also quoted a security source as saying the release monday of 
mithileshwar singh an indian who is a resident us alien marked 
the beginning of the release of more american hostages before 
the us presidential election on nov 8 
singh was kidnapped jan 24 1987 at beirut university college 
with three americans alann steen robert polhill and jesse 
turner all four taught at the school 
steens wife virginiarose who returned to beirut on friday 
from a summer trip to the united states said today we are 
hopeful that all three will be released very soon 
mrs steen a fine arts professor at beirut university college 
said she wanted to be in beirut with the wives of polhill and 
turner shiite extremists shun the kidnapping of women 
peggy say the sister of american terry anderson the 
longestheld foreign hostage said in lexington ky friday that 
her brother will be devastated if his release is not obtained 
by the nov 8 presidential election 
referring to information she received from a recently freed 
hostage mrs say said terry is geared to the elections he 
feels it will take that to get him out of there im afraid if they 
come and go its going to be very devastating to him anderson 
chief middle east correspondent of the associated press was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 
alanwar a conservative daily newspaper based in christian east 
beirut quoted one unidentified source as saying waite was moved 
from the bekaa valley to beiruts southern suburbs and predicted he 
would be freed within 72 hours 
another unidentified source however said he would be freed 
when britain restores diplomatic relations with syria alanwar 
reported the anglican church and british government said they had 
no new information about waite 
britain severed relations with syria in november 1986 accusing 
it of involvement in a plot to blow up an israeli airliner 
syria the major power broker in lebanon and an ally of iran 
has said it is working for release of all hostages held in lebanon 
most are believed to be in the hands of shiite moslems loyal to 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini leader of irans fundamentalist 
revolution 
both beirut publications have been inaccurate in recent reports 
about hostages but ashshiraa correctly revealed in november 1986 
that the united states had secretly delivered arms to iran 
shipments that gave rise to the irancontra affair 
the report about arms in the nation said the us government 
also agreed to pay 7 million ransom to shiite moslem extremists 
holding the hostages but refused their demand for immunity from 
prosecution 
lebanese police said friday two unidentified foreigners 
kidnapped in moslem west beirut 21 months ago were czechoslovak 
businessmen held only a few days the report leaves 14 foreigners 
missing in lebanon including nine americans

local authorities are razing the town of 
chernobyl site of the worlds worst nuclear power accident 
because its buildings will never be fit for human habitation 
pravda said today 
the radiation situation in chernobyl is such that full life of 
people cannot resume for decades v komarov chief engineer of 
the nuclear power agency running the nearby chernobyl power plant 
was quoted as saying 
the town which formerly had 10000 residents was evacuated in 
april 1986 when a fire at the nuclear plant spewed radiation 
worldwide officials said 31 people were killed 
authorities originally planned to tear down only dilapidated 
houses komarov wrote in an article in the power plant newspaper 
quoted by pravda the soviet communist partys newspaper 
but by the time normal life can return all the houses will be 
equally dilapidated and living in them will be impossible he 
said in other words there will be scarcely anything to preserve 
at all 
officials started by setting fire to one house and then 
bulldozed two streets of homes in the center of the town pravda 
said some of the buildings were just 3 years old 
pravda objected to the decision and pointed out that a similar 
town also 11 miles from the power plant has been decontaminated 
and repopulated 
the revitalized town of gden is in the byelorussian republic 
north of the chernobyl power plant the town of chernobyl is in the 
ukraine 
the area within six miles of the power plant is a preserve where 
the effects of radiation on animals and plants is being studied 
some workers come into the area on temporary duty but no one is 
allowed to live there 
pravda also reported that 994 people mostly middleaged and 
elderly have moved back into the ukrainian section of the 18mile 
danger zone outside the uninhabitated ring 
reports this spring said 100 people returned to chernobyl 
itself but pravda said they were given no consideration in the 
decision to raze the town 
gamma background radiation levels in chernobyl were 01 
milliroentgen per hour in june equal to the natural radioactivity 
in mountainous areas but twice that of the ukrainian capital kiev 
south of chernobyl the newspaper said

emergency in a protest march friday but dispersed without

motives of different groups of demonstrators were often difficult 
to sort out

favorite soccer clubs fundamentalists urging transformation of 
algeria from a secular state into an iranianstyle islamic 
republic and vandals causing destruction for no apparent reason 
a military communique friday warned that troops were ordered to 
use arms against all those who refuse to obey immediately the

a soviet weekly published an unusually detailed 
account of a massacre in the stalin era in which police lined more 
than 100000 people along ditches gagged them and shot them 
sometimes using one bullet for two people 
although the 29year reign of dictator josef stalin has recently 
been fiercely criticized in the soviet press few articles have 
gone as far as the moscow news account of the massacre at kuropaty 
near minsk in the 1930s 
gunshots resounded night and day winter and summer and there 
were also cries prayers and moans moscow news wrote in an 
article entitled kuropaty the human tragedy about which everyone 
must know 
it said the police confronted a woodsman who saw freshly dug 
mass graves and abandoned personal belongings near the killing site 
and told him see less if you want to live 
the story in this weeks issue combined personal accounts from 
people who lived around the site with reports from recent 
excavations to piece together what happened at kuropaty 
men and women branded enemies of the people under stalin 
were brought alongside the newly dug ditches and made to stand in 
rows the paper said they were then gagged and shot it said 
in some cases the victims were made to stand so that one bullet 
would kill two people moscow news said 
for the nkvd secret police who carried out the executions 
this was their brand of bravado of sport a show of 
professionalism the paper said 
zenon poznyak an archaeologist who wrote the moscow news story 
said the number of people buried at kuropaty was estimated at 
102000 at the very least 
however the actual number of victims must be higher 
poznyak wrote 
moscow news and another weekly ogonyok previously reported 
that soviet authorities after world war ii tried to cover up what 
happened at kuropaty 
as a result of the recent publicity the byelorussian 
prosecutors office has opened a criminal investigation into the 
massacres but staterun media have never said who might be 
prosecuted or for what

fantasy focuses on two indian characters the benevolent one acts 
as a messenger for mohammed the founder of the islamic religion 
the other is satanic and manipulative 
rushdie 41 responded to the ban in a statement issued by index 
on censorship a britishbased journal on issues of free speech 
around the world 
i feel very shocked by the news the bombayborn novelist 
said for india to describe itself as it frequently does as the 
worlds largest democracy is clearly incompatible with the act of 
banning a work of literature 
i very much hope that good sense can prevail and that this 
decision can speedily be reversed so that indian readers might have 
a chance to judge the book for themselves said rushdie whose 
previous novels include shame and midnights children 
the protest telegram which was sent friday said 
we consider that the banning of a serious work of literature 
represents a very grave threat to freedom of expression in your 
country and strongly urge you to ensure that the ban is lifted

sally laird the director and editor respectively of index on 
censorship and kevin boyle director of article 19 a second

and five 20year terms to be served concurrently he said he would 
recommend that harvey get psychiatric help in prison 
i think you need treatment karrh told the weeping harvey

which began wednesday that he was exercising his constitutional 
right to bear arms and was making a statement for the nations 
homeless poor and illiterate

the trial sat at the defense table and cried while he signed a

i want him well 
all i wanted from the beginning was for him to get some help 
but he didnt agree until this morning that he needed help 
the trials end saves gov guy hunt from having to testify 
harvey had summoned him as a defense witness because the governors

three highpowered guns and walk out of the school building exactly 
12 hours after he and another man had entered the school 
the other man john rhodes jr emerged during the afternoon of 
the siege and also was charged with kidnapping but later was freed 
after authorities determined that harvey had tricked him into 
helping him

powdery coating state police tests completed friday identified the 
substance 
the boy did not become ill or need hospitalization mcclure 
said he said he did not know if any other contaminated boxes were 
distributed 
information we have from interviews with the housewife and her

batch was packaged aug 4 and distributed in an area ranging from 
massachusetts to florida and west to ohio mcclure said

about 2000 people most of them silent some 
sobbing quietly braved nearfreezing temperatures early today to 
open a display on the ellipse behind the white house of a massive 
quilt memorializing aids victims on the ellipse behind the white 
house 
its a beautiful thing but its built on corpses said cleve 
jones who opened an 11hour rite in which 495 people including 
entertainers and kitty dukakis were to read all 8288 names 
embroidered and painted on the quilts panels 
i guess the main thing im feeling this morning is anger 
said jones who made the first 3foot by 6foot panel after the 
death of his friend in 1986 from aids or acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome he said he was angry most at president reagan 
at this point its a little late for mr reagan to do 
anything jones said he should have understood many years ago 
that a new and deadly virus has emerged and that it was time to 
take some action 
jones said reagan had many opportunities to act including when 
former rep stewart mckinney rconn or his friend rock 
hudson died from aids 
as the names of the aids victims resounded over the address 
system mayer and pat levy of st louis whose 31yearold son died 
last year silently waited their turn to read their list 
were doing this in memory of our son to help others levy 
said tearfully noting that the quilt would help parents releive 
their grief and acknowledge that their son was gay and passed 
away 
others like chris bates of washington just cried 
i knew all of these people in new york san francisco and 
washington bates said they were my contemporaries im not 40 
yet and all i talk about now is death my grandmother talks about 
death its not right 
mrs dukakis wife of democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis was scheduled to read later today some of the names of the 
victims listed on the quilt which is the size of nearly seven 
football fields 
among others scheduled to read the names of victims were rep 
gerry studds dmass and actresses shirley maclaine sigourney 
weaver and elizabeth mcgovern 
construction of the quilt began in 1986 after project executive 
director cleve jones made the first panel for a friend who died of 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
since it was first displayed in the capital last year the quilt 
has more than quadrupled in size from 1920 panels to 8800 
at its present size it represents more than onefifth of the 
approximately 42000 americans known to have died of aids since 
june 1981 
the framework for the display complete with 16 miles of canvas 
walkway and trim arranged to allow an expected 250000 spectators a 
closer view of the quilts panels was laid out friday 
many of the volunteers such as bostons julie kaufman became 
involved with the project after a friend died of the disease 
travel kits tshirts posters and a book about the life stories 
behind the panels are among items being sold to defray the cost of 
bringing the massive display to the capital 
panels not on the ellipse will be on display around the city at 
various aids support group centers american red cross headquarters 
here has an exhibit of photographs of aids victims 
debra resnik who managed a 20city tour for the quilt said 
public reaction has been strong 
there was such an outpouring of relief of pain she said 
especially when we went to cities like kansas city new orleans 
baltimore the really sheltered places where friends and relatives 
of aids victims are so alone you have a place to go to carry 
your grief 
former actor barry singer who has aids agreed that the quilt 
offers a chance to humanize the statistics but he said it provokes 
a number of emotions including anger 
there wouldnt have to be a quilt if there would have been 
government intervention he said it is now up to the people to 
realize that it is no longer and never really has been just the gay 
community dying from aids

flying bullets forced firefighters to take 
cover when an ammunition manufacturing company caught fire and 
exploded killing four people authorities said 
investigators from the state fire marshals office and the 
federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms worked today to 
determine what caused the fire and explosions friday at the buffalo 
rock shooters supply seven miles west of this northcentral 
illinois town

departments around the country authorities said

sell guns dettore said a place like that with all that black 
powder just the dust if you get a spark in there thats all its 
going to take they had cases and cases and cases of all kinds of 
ammunition all kinds of guns 
bullets were whizzing through the air when firefighters arrived 
at the complex which also included three ammunition and gun 
storage buildings dettore said 
its not as dangerous as if it was shot out of a gun itself 
the fire chief said it gets a little scarey when you get a big 
explosion 
we started putting it out until we were told there was black 
powder in there and then i evacuated all of the men out dettore 
said 
he said the 40 firefighters retreated about a halfmile from the 
complex for 45 minutes and then resumed battling the blaze

demanding the immediate removal of the local communist leadership 
the staterun tanjug news agency said montenegrin party leaders 
held an emergency session to discuss the demand and tensions in the 
region 
police dispersed the protesters in the latest clash in a growing 
wave of economic and ethnic unrest in yugoslavias six republics 
and two autonoous provinces this was believed to be the first time 
police used force 
tanjug said 23 demonstrators were detained for making 
unspecified public hostile declarations but most were later 
released

spoke on condition of anonymity tanjug said several demonstrators 
were injured but did not provide figures 
in belgrade the national capital the ruling communist party 
presidium met today to discuss the developments in montenegro

friday and stayed there all night defying repeated police attempts 
to disperse and demanding the ouster of the communist party 
leadership witnesses said 
you betrayed us chanted the crowd in titograd 280 miles 
southwest of belgrade we want bread our children are hungry 
the flagwaving emotional crowd tried several times to force 
its way into the parliament building but were prevented by police 
and riot squads 
at about 7 am riot police charged with clubs pushing the 
crowd into a nearby park tanjug said 
a police spokesman who demanded anonymity said police intervened 
because of nationalistic vulgar and hostile speeches delivered 
by several people during the overnight meeting he said police and 
the towns authorities will not allow the continuation of the 
rally because it has been abused by individuals to deliver hostile 
slogans 
the mayor of titograd which has 150000 inhabitants has

the policymaking central committee plenum to meet oct 17 will 
make necessary personnel changes to deal with the crisis 
a growing number of yugoslavians have called for a toplevel 
shakeup as the unrest continues the public protests stem from the 
countrys worst economic crisis in its history and longsimmering 
feuds between ethnic groups

tensions between the mostly christian slav minority and the largely 
moslem ethnic albanian majority in the southern kosovo province in 
the republic of serbia

countrys political and economic system to help resolved the crisis

as election day nears education remains at 
best a marginal issue in the 1988 campaign the stuff of political 
rhetoric and modest promises but not a cuttingedge issue for 
either candidate 
more attention has been paid to whether teachers should be 
compelled to lead the pledge of allegiance at the start of each 
school day than to what students learn after that patriotic ritual 
george bush has said repeatedly he wants to go down in history 
as the education president the republican candidate tells 
voters wherever he goes that better schools are the key to a better 
future for america 
michael dukakis too avers that he wants to be the education 
president the democrat gets big cheers every time he promises 
were going to make teaching a valued and honored profession 
again 
whichever candidate wins on nov 8 educators are confident the 
education budget will be in safer hands under the next president 
than under ronald reagan 
but they say neither bush who attended private schools as a 
youngster nor dukakis who attended public schools has done 
enough to dramatize the problems facing american schools or to 
spell out a convincing plan to improve performance 
ernest l boyer president of the carnegie foundation for the 
advancement of teaching said we hear strong inspirational 
statements about how important education is but the direction the 
education president would take is still not clear 
at the outset of the campaign the candidates were stumbling 
all over themselves to say this was americas most urgent 
obligation said boyer it faded as a central issue 
richard berendzen president of the american university in 
washington said i grade both on what i hear and what i dont 
hear id give both a dplus 
berendzen said 25 percent of american young people drop out of 
high school and 20 percent grow up in poverty and the united 
states is far back on international scholastic tests 
if you take a sober look at the matter you could say that the 
preparation of our youth today and workforce readiness for the year 
2000 is one of the two or three top issues facing america said 
berendzen 
despite the generalities said college board president donald m 
stewart it is obvious both candidates are making the link 
between economic productivity and international competitiveness and 
the underserved undereducated poor 
however dennis doyle a hudson institute scholar said it is 
inevitable that education will slip to the back of the presidents 
agenda 
education is 15th or 20th on the real list the president will 
actually keep as apart from a campaign list said doyle the 
deficit defense international relations economic problems even 
health care social security transportation and housing all are 
higher on their priority list 
both candidates have outlined ways to help families cope with 
the soaring costs of college bush with a taxfree savings bond 
plan and dukakis with a new loan program that students would repay 
through payroll deductions 
bush whose administration tried to cut 5 billion from the 
education department last year actually has proposed bigger 
spending increases than his rival 
here are their major education proposals

schools that emphasize various academic subjects 
expanding from 12 million to 50 million a proposed fund for 
innovation and reform of schools and teaching to give each state 1 
million for an experimental district trying such concepts as 
parental choice merit pay or yearround schools 
money for head start the 12 billion preschool program for 
disadvantaged children would be sharply increased by an 
unspecified amount bush said he is committed to building head 
start to a level where all eligible 4yearolds can attend 
classes the childrens defense fund says the 453000 children 
now in head start are only 16 percent of those eligible 
bush has also promised to spend more on chapter 1 a 46 
billion remedial program that serves about 55 percent of eligible 
poor students

eventually cost the treasury 200 million a year the tax break 
would be phased out for families earning 60000 to 80000 or

a student tuition and repayment system stars allowing 
students to pay back college loans through payroll deductions in 
their working years it would supplement not replace existing 
federal grants and loans at least at the start students would get 
stars loans from banks 
dukakis officials have suggested a payback rate of oneeighth to 
onequarter of 1 percentage point of earnings per 1000 borrowed 
meaning a tax of 25 to 5 percent for a 20000 borrower 
the rate stays the same for low and highincome earners but 
the loan is never paid off

on june 14 1985 robert stethem 
and five fellow us navy divers were flying back from a project in 
greece looking forward to seeing family and friends in the united 
states 
the next day stethem a bullet in his head was pushed out of 
the plane and died on the tarmac of the beirut airport 
witnesses at the trial of confessed hijacker mohammed ali hamadi 
have been giving a frankfurt court a gutwrenching account of the 
slaying of the 23yearold maryland man who hoped to make a career 
in the navy but who became the only person killed in the hijacking 
of twa flight 847 
the court has not ruled on the facts of the case but the 
witnesses and official accounts have made possible a reconstruction 
of stethems last hours 
shortly after the boeing 727 leaves athens some passengers hear 
a commotion from the rear of the jetliner as two shiite moslem 
gunmen run screaming down the aisle brandishing a hand grenade and 
a chromeplated pistol 
americans die come to die passenger kurt carlson hears the 
gunmen shouting at the 145 passengers and eight crew members at 
about 10 am 
clinton suggs stationed in norfolk va wakes his navy buddy 
stethem from a short nap 
this should be interesting stethem says 
stethem is dressed casually in a checkered shirt and slacks he 
has traded in the long hair he sported at thomas stone high school 
in waldorf md near washington for the closecropped haircut more 
suited to underwater welding 
hamadi and his accomplice hassan ezzeddine quickly round up 
passports and single out the us military personnel 
the military men are hustled up to the firstclass section 
where a language difficulty fueled hamadis notion that stethem is 
a us marine and therefore the object of particular hate 
stethem is tied up with elastic baggage straps and the first in 
a long series of beatings begins sometimes they are just a few 
feet from pilot john testrake of richmond mo and the two other 
men in the cockpit 
at one point stethem complains about his bonds and shouts 
its too tight its too tight 
hamadi who records show has just turned 21 responds let the 
pig suffer 
stethems shouts are heard throughout the jetliner as it 
approaches beirut airport 
one hijacker beats stethem with an armrest torn from a seat the 
sharp metal screws still pointing out when stethem collapses 
nearly unconscious one of the hijackers jumps up and down on his 
ribs leaving his chest a mass of blackandblue marks 
marine marine the tormentors scream apparently recalling 
the us marine presence in lebanon in 1983 
they beat stethem again after authorities at beirut airport 
delay refueling the airliner stethem barely able to walk is 
helped back to the coach section 
thats when he meets up again with ruth henderson an australian 
teenager who chatted with stethem at the athens airport 
stethem is crying several ribs are broken and one hand is 
completely numb as he sits next to the girl 
ruth helps stethem eat because he is unable to feed himself the 
unmarried diver barely able to talk tells ruth he hopes that if 
anyone has to die he will be the one since his navy buddies on the 
flight are all married 
the plane heads to algeria early that same friday afternoon 
after the fourhour flight the hijackers savagely beat army 
reserve officer carlson of rockford ill and leave him for dead 
during tense negotiations for more jet fuel 
in the evening the hijackers order the plane back to beirut 
stethem is brought back to the front of the airplane and the 
beating resumes the plane lands early the next morning saturday 
june 15 1985 
when negotiations with the tower in beirut erupt into a 
screaming match one of the hijackers shouts get up get up 
to stethem his head leaves a huge red imprint of blood on the 
aircrafts side 
stethem and suggs are bound and blindfolded 
sometime after 230 am in beirut the hijackers pull the 
curtain on the firstclass section the stunned passengers and crew 
hear one shot possibly more 
when the bullet pierces his head behind the right ear and exits 
on the other side of his head stethem exhales so loudly the 
passengers and crew hear it above the whining of the jet engines 
my god they have shot someone chief flight attendant uli 
derickson says 
the hijackers toss stethem still moaning out the passenger 
exit and down onto the runway where he lives for about 10 minutes 
his body is taken to the morgue at the american university 
hospital in beirut 
hamadi has denied pulling the trigger and said it was the work 
of his accomplice 
but stethems supervisor navy diver stuart dahl also stationed 
in norfolk va said hamadi gloated over the slaying 
he was proud of it dahl testified he looked like the fox 
that got the chicken he showed absolutely no remorse

to democratic development the ads said the attackers were 
leftist radicals trying to overthrow the government 
the three main opposition parties said the government was 
overreacting in an effort to take attention away from allegations

republican george bush concluding a week of attacks on democrat 
michael dukakis stands on crime accepted the endorsement of the 
head of a national police group today then said in answer to 
reporters questions that he has not been trying to distance 
himself from running mate dan quayle 
bush said he was getting a little tired of erroneous reporting 
out there that has noted his relative lack of comment on quayle 
since wednesday nights vice presidential debate which polls show 
most people thought quayle lost to democrat lloyd bentsen 
this concept that i see in some of these reports that i am not 
supportive of dan quayle are absolutely ludicrous he said 
they are ridiculous he did well in that debate he has my full 
support and i made a good decision in selecting the indiana 
senator as running mate 
bush commented in washington after accepting the endorsement of 
dewey stokes president of the national fraternal order of police 
a news release from the bush campaign emphasized the 197000person 
membership of the organization but stokes acknowledged he was only 
giving his personal support not that of the group which has not 
taken a position on the race 
dukakis meanwhile was heading for maine today after a speech 
friday in which he stood in a missouri auto parts plant owned by 
italians and attacked foreign ownership of american firms 
lloyd bentsen the democratic vice presidential nominee said 
today in texas he wouldnt let the republicans concentrate only on 
bush and keep the spotlight off dan quayle the gop running mate 
whom bentsen debated wednesday night 
he said the gop had made a mistake in choosing a candidate 
that the imagemakers and the poll takers thought could be packaged 
and sold to the american people 
as for dukakis speech friday campaign aides moving quickly to 
say that he was not criticizing any company in particular 
acknowledged that he didnt know the moog automotive inc plant in 
suburban st louis had foreign owners 
if anyone asks you whats at stake in this election just 
remind them of that moment in the debate wednesday night when 
senator quayle said hes happy that foriegn owners are buying up 
america dukakis said 
maybe the republican ticket wants our children to work for 
foreign owners pay rent to foreign owners and owe their future to 
foreign owners but thats not the kind of future lloyd bentsen 
and i and missouri rep dick gephardt want for america he 
continued 
the moog family sold the company more than 10 years ago to ifint 
usa the american subsidiary of ifi of turin italy ifi is owned 
by the agnelli family which also owns the automaker fiat 
dukakis later said of the incident it was not a faux pas 
the candidates made their rounds as sponsors of next weeks 
second and final presidential debate said the event would be held 
thursday or friday night on the ucla campus in los angeles 
beginning at 9 pm edt the 90minute encounter will be televised 
nationally 
bush who has made massachusetts former prison furlough program 
the centerpiece of his softoncrime attack against dukakis has 
been criticized by the dukakis camp for making such charges when he 
is vice president of the federal government which also has a 
furlough program 
theres no question that the federal furlough program should 
be reviewed bushs chief of staff craig fuller told reporters 
on friday we talked about it today george bush would have 
his attorney general do that 
fuller said the repbulican candidate had no specific proposal to 
revise the current law and that bush was satisfied it is 
fundamentally different from the massachusetts law that granted 
a weekend furlough in 1986 to convicted murderer willie horton 
in a campaign speech friday in xenia ohio bush charged that 
dukakis as massachusetts governor relented and repealed the law 
that let murderers go on weekend furlough under the bright 
spotlight of the national presidential campaign 
in some of the harshest language he has used to describe dukakis 
as soft on crime bush accused his rival of having compassion for 
criminals but an astounding lack of sensitivity for crime 
victims 
with one month to go to the election the polls continued to 
show bush a step ahead in the race for the white house democrats 
were hoping that other polls rating bentsen as the winner of the 
vice presidential debate would serve as prelude to a shift in the 
presidential race itself 
gop vice presidential candidate quayle laughed at that as he 
shrugged off democratic campaign commercials aimed at raising 
doubts about his fitness for high office 
we can stand the heat were going to stay in the kitchen 
george bush is going to be the next president of the united states 
the voters will vote for him the indiana senator said as he 
campaigned in tennessee 
bentsen chipped in on the democratic antiquayle barrage saying 
it was an incredible misfit for his vice presidential rival to 
compare his own experience in congress with john kennedys before 
the 1960 election quayles selfcomparison produced the most 
riveting moment of the debate when bentsen turned to him and said 
senator youre no jack kennedy

republican george bush today denounced as 
absolutely ludicrous any notion that he is trying to keep his 
distance from running mate dan quayle 
hes doing just fine bush said in answer to a question from 
reporters after he accepted the endorsement of a law enforcement 
official i support him very strongly 
bush added with apparent anger in his voice this concept that 
i see in some of these reports that i am not supportive of dan 
quayle are absolutely ludicrous 
they are ridiculous he said he did well in that debate 
he has my full support and i made a good decision in 
selecting the indiana senator 
bush said he gets a little tired of erroneous reporting out 
there 
he was endorsed today by dewey stokes president of the national 
fraternal order of police who called bush the law enforcement 
candidate 
however while a news release from the bush campaign touted the 
197000person membership of stokes organization stokes 
acknowledged that he was only giving his personal support not that 
of the organization which has not taken a position 
bush has made massachusetts former prison furlough program the 
centerpiece of his softoncrime attack against presidential rival 
michael dukakis but a top aide said friday that bush believes the 
federal prison furlough program should be reviewed as well 
dukakis aides have criticized bush for attacking dukakis on the 
subject while bush is vice president of a federal system that also 
has a furlough program 
theres no question that the federal furlough program should 
be reviewed bushs chief of staff craig fuller told reporters 
on friday we talked about it today george bush would have 
his attorney general do that 
fuller said the republican candidate had no specific proposal to 
revise the current law and that bush was satisfied it is 
fundamentally different from the massachusetts law that granted 
a weekend furlough in 1986 to convicted murderer willie horton 
questions about the federal furlough program arose as bush 
stepped up his attack against dukakis over the furlough program in 
the democratic governors home state 
in a campaign speech friday in xenia ohio bush charged that 
dukakis as governor relented and repealed the law that let 
murderers go on weekend furlough under the bright spotlight of 
the national presidential campaign this year 
bush called dukakis the furlough king later at an outdoor 
rally of several thousand pople in medina an affluent white suburb 
of cleveland 
he continued the toughoncrime talk at a later rally at lees 
summit high school in missouri before returning to washington 
he said dukakis has always espoused liberal views 
what i fault him for is trying to now be something he is 
not bush told the packed high school gym 
reporters were denied access to bush as has been the case since 
last week but the campaign put out an information sheet when asked 
what bush had to say on the federal governments own furlough 
program 
it said the federal furloughs are granted only within two years 
of a prisoners release date 
the massachusetts program was more lenient fuller said citing 
the horton case in which horton bludgeoned a maryland couple 
raping the woman after escaping during a weekend furlough 
fuller said horton could not have been furloughed under the 
federal program which is available only to prisoners in 
community custody the lowest security level in the federal 
prison system 
in some of the harshest language he has used to describe dukakis 
as soft on crime bush alleged friday that his rival has compassion 
for criminals but an astounding lack of sensitivity for crime 
victims 
he still clings to a discredited liberal ideology that blinds 
him to the true causes of crime and the often devastating effects 
it has on innocent people bush said in the xenia speech to law 
enforcement officials and supporters 
im not faulting the governor of maassachusetts for one error 
in judgment but it concerns me deeply that in all this time as 
far as i know the governor has never acknowledged that his 
furlough program was a mistake bush said 
on no other issue is my opponents philosophy so completely at 
odds with mine and i would say with the common sense attitudes of 
the american people than on the issue of crime bush said 
another crimeoriented speech is set for monday in new jersey 
campaign aides said

the leader of lebanons syrianbacked 
cabinet on saturday opposed deploying un peacekeeping troops to 
supervise deadlocked presidential elections the proposal is backed 
by a rival christian cabinet 
there are practical procedural difficulties at the united 
nations in assigning un forces internal missions like supervision 
of security for the presidential election session acting prime 
minister salim hoss told reporters before leaving for talks in 
damascus the syrian capital 
he planned to discuss the presidential election with officials 
there 
the reasons behind the failure to elect a president have not 
been related to security issues so far but to the lack of 
consensus on the presidents identity and his political line 
hoss said 
lebanons government splintered into rival moslem and christian 
factions after parliament failed to elect a new president when amin 
gemayels term expired sept 22 
a french proposal to deploy un forces in beirut to oversee the 
election was endorsed by lebanons christian militia commander 
samir geagea on thursday 
geagea who opposes syrias involvement in lebanon backs the 
christian cabinet headed by the army commander gen michel aoun 
syria the main power broker in lebanon maintains 40000 troops 
in eastern and northern provinces as well as in the moslem western 
and southern sectors of beirut 
parliament failed to elect a new president due to a lack of 
quorum following a boycott by christian deputies 
gemayel acting minutes before the expiration of his term 
appointed gen aoun a maronite catholic to head a sixman interim 
cabinet 
syrianbacked moslem and leftist leaders have rejected aouns 
cabinet continuing to recognize hoss fiveman body that ruled 
during gemayels term

when the 100th congress began the district of 
columbia dreamed of becoming the nations 51st state but as 
congress winds down almost two years later the dream has ended and 
the nations capital is hoping to hold on to whatever limited 
selfgovernance it has 
somehow the district became entangled in four touchy issues 
abortion rights life insurance for aids victims homosexual rights 
and a residency requirement for city workers 
in all four congress has told the city to change its laws or 
lose the money the federal government provides as a payment for the 
cost incurred in being the seat of the federal government 
those actions stunned city officials especially walter 
fauntroy the local clergyman who serves as the districts 
nonvoting delegate in the house of representatives he accused 
colleagues of exerting raw naked power over the city 
it is unfair to single out the district of columbia and tell 
them how to spend local funds fumes fauntroy that violates 
the letter and spirit of home rule 
adds julius hobson the citys chief lobbyist to congress by 
taking these actions the congress has in effect created the us 
department of the district of columbia the floodgates have been 
opened after this what next 
fauntroy had bragged he would force a vote on the house floor on 
the statehood issue by last july 4 he was wrong and he now 
concedes the issue may not even come up for a vote in the 101st 
congress which begins its twoyear run in january 
under the limited home rule law enacted by congress in 1974 
congress approves the citys budget home rule gave the citys 
670000 residents the right to elect a mayor and city council but 
left them without a vote in congress and provided a congressional 
veto of laws enacted by the city council congress has exercised 
the veto only twice before 
this years city budget is 32 billion including 539 million 
in federal money which is supposed to be a payment in lieu of 
taxes on real estate owned by the federal government and foreign 
governments 
on the demand of conservatives congress attached amendments to 
the appropriations bill and president reagan signed them into law 
last weekend 
one provides that the city couldnt pay for any abortions except 
to save the life of the mother in the past eight years the 
district government paid for 32725 abortions 
another amendent demanded that the city repeal a law requiring 
insurance companies to sell life insurance to people with aids a 
third insisted the city revamp its human rights code under which 
georgetown university has been required to grant rights to gay 
student groups 
a fourth told the city to soften its law requiring most city 
employees to live within the districts boundaries 
the city just happened to be a victim on the issues of 
abortion and gay rights said sen charles grassley riowa who 
sided with the city on those questions the city became a 
battleground for two larger social issues it just happened to be 
there at the wrong time 
meanwhile the statehood quest championed by fauntroy has 
bogged down over questions about whether congress would still pay 
the city in exchange for lost tax revenues 
senate republicans would be sure to oppose statehood out of 
recognition that the heavilydemocratic state of new columbia 
almost certainly would be represented by two democratic senators 
congressional approval of statehood would only be the first 
step a constitutional amendment would have to be approved by 
threequarters of the states before it could take effect 
in the past reagan has threatened to veto the districts 
spending package if it did not include abortion language similar to 
the restriction proposed by rep robert dornan rcalif 
however reagan was prevented from doing so because the city 
budget was often lumped with several other appropriation measures 
into a single bill vetoing it would have denied federal agencies 
of funds 
fauntry said adoption this time of a separate bill dealing with 
district of columbia spending left the city vulnerable to prolife 
and antigay forces in congress 
while fauntroy has threatened to encourage city officials to 
disobey the congressional orders and city council chairman david 
clarke has called for citizens of the nations capital to take to 
the streets in protest mayor marion barry jr surprised many 
washingtonians by remaining aloof 
this vote is not a direct attack on home rule barry said 
after all they did approve every penny of our appropriations 
bill the district bill was just used as a vehicle by special 
interest groups on electionyear issues 
fauntroy said he is considering filing lawsuits and initiating 
nonviolent protests to challenge the congressional action clarke 
said his sworn oath to uphold the constitution would prevent him 
from restricting abortion funding or changing the human rights code

portauprince haiti ap the euphoria that greeted the 
soldiers rebellion in haiti is giving way to skepticism of new 
president prosper avril and his apparent view that the nation is 
not ready for democracy 
we were encouraged by the coup detat we were optimistic 
after our conversation with lt gen avril and sgt joseph 
heubreux now we are disappointed said opposition leader louis 
dejoie jr who met with the two last week 
dejoie and other political and labor leaders give avril high 
marks for his actions in the three weeks since heubreux and other 
enlisted men of the presidential guard deposed lt gen henri 
namphy and placed avril in the presidency 
but concern is growing over avrils close ties to the 
dictatorships that preceded him and a reported reluctance to call 
elections 
dejoie referred to a story in the paris daily liberation which 
quoted avril as saying haitians are too poor for immediate 
democracy 
avril has told some visitors elections probably wont be held 
for 2 years 
on wednesday a popular priest said avril could not be trusted 
until he eliminates the dreaded tonton macoutes the private army 
that operated under dictators francois and jeanclaude duvalier 
members of the tonton macoutes have been blamed for the sept 11 
killing of 13 parishoners and wounding of more than 70 at st jean 
bosco roman catholic church 
the people do not trust you the people should consider all 
bigshot duvalierists as big time criminals until they prove the 
contrary for the rest of their lives the rev jeanbertrand 
aristide said in remarks directed to avril in a radio speech 
the young priest is considered one of haitis most popular 
figures among the poor 
dejoie said avril must declare his government shortterm and 
provisional and reinstate the suspended 1987 constitution 
dejoie said avril also must arrest and try the thugs responsible 
for the church slayings and for the deaths of 34 voters during the 
aborted presidential election in november 
he called avrils statement that haitians are not ready for 
democracy an insult to the people and proof that he has not yet 
divorced himself from duvalierism 
we are not impatient two and a half years have gone by since 
the fall of the duvalier regime we are overpatient said dejoie 
haiti was ruled for 29 years by francois duvalier and then his 
son jeanclaude who fled the country in february 1986 after 
widespread unrest namphy led a junta until february when civilian 
president leslie manigat was sworn in namphy ousted manigat in 
june 
avril is a close friend of the younger duvalier and became a 
millionaire as duvaliers financial adviser 
rene theodore leader of the haitian communist party said 
avrils future authority is linked to bringing about democracy in 
haiti 
whatever avril might personally desire he participates in and 
is controlled by a situation he did not make himself theodore 
said tuesday one day after meeting with avril and heubreau 
the soldiers sent namphy into exile in the dominican republic 
and forced franck romain ousted mayor of portauprince and an 
alleged leader of the macoutes to seek political asylum in the 
dominican embassy 
avril also retired col jeanclaude paul former commander of 
the 700man dessalines battalion on sept 30 soldiers arrested 
about 30 alleged macoutes linked to the church massacre 
paul who has been indicted by a federal grand jury in miami on 
drug trafficking charges was considered the commander most likely 
to lead any resistance to the rebellion he is reported under house 
arrest 
dejoie said he had gone to washington seeking support for a 
provisional government until elections are held 
the us government has withheld aid to haiti 
they still see avril as involved with duvalierism dejoie 
said avrils tarnished image improved after the coup detat but 
not enough to shine

democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis is trying hard to beat the rap that his experience as a 
governor has not equipped him to handle national defense and 
foreign policy 
he has talked tough on military spending and driven an m1 tank 
met with foreign leaders from soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze to french president francois mitterrand and he has 
extolled the virtues of governors who became president 
or three of them anyway 
some of our finest presidents some of our strongest 
international leaders were governors franklin roosevelt woodrow 
wilson theodore roosevelt dukakis said in the first 
presidential debate 
he did not mention the last two presidents both of them former 
governers whose foreign policy performances have brought mixed 
reviews 
ronald reagan a twoterm california governor is regularly 
lambasted by critics who say he is unfamiliar with the nitty gritty 
of national security he is faulted for such acts as the 1983 
invasion of grenada and the 1986 bombing of libya and for moving 
slowly on arms control his record as president will be tainted by 
the irancontra affair as well 
jimmy carter who was governor of georgia is blamed by 
conservatives for reacting poorly to revolutions in iran and 
nicaragua and for allowing us influence abroad to deteriorate 
if elected dukakis would be the third man in a row to move from 
the state house to the white house without having held a senior 
federal job 
only one other former governor wilson of new jersey has become 
president in this century without previously holding top elected or 
appointed federal office 
franklin roosevelt lauded by dukakis was assistant secretary 
of the navy during world war i before he served as governor of new 
york theodore roosevelt held identical posts at the turn of the 
century before becoming vice president and then president 
dukakis doesnt have those entries on his resume but like 
others before him he is trying to create a lot of ersatz 
credentials in foreign policy said stephen hess who was an aide 
to former president nixon 
they go on trade missions they join the council on foreign 
relations or the trilateral commission which is what carter did 
said hess now a scholar at the liberal brookings institution in 
washington 
or they ride tanks and meet with foreign leaders 
governors who are elected president rely on a brain trust but 
so does everybody else too as the field becomes more 
specialized said hess even richard nixon who was truly 
engaged in foreign policy and made it his life interest brought in 
specialists notably henry kissinger who served as his national 
security adviser 
graham t allison jr a dukakis foreign policy adviser says 
the massachusetts governors style as a leader and governor is 
quite different from either reagan or carter 
dukakis ideas come out of interaction with other folks there 
is a combination of progressive values and pragmatism that is 
something special it is not classic liberalism said allison 
carters view of the world was shaped by his career as a 
submarine officer in the navy and his devotion to his baptist faith 
he appointed a strongminded national security adviser zbigniew 
brzezinski a columbia university professor of soviet affairs born 
in poland and deeply suspicious of the kremlin 
carter appointed a very different personality as his secretary 
of state cyrus vance a wall street lawyer and veteran of senior 
government appointments who was deeply committed to diplomacy and 
negotiations 
there were two worldviews spinning around at the top level 
of government said hess and the result was a sometimes confused 
and vacillating approach to foreign affairs that ultimately brought 
vances resignation 
allison said carter was very interested in detail he had 
difficulty keeping his mind focused on the big picture and was 
unable to resist an overly expansive agenda 
reagan is very effective at projecting a few central themes 
but does not involve himself directly in the issues neither in the 
broad shape of the issues or in the details but he has kept in 
mind a few simple things and knows what a manageable agenda is 
said allison who is dean of the john f kennedy school of 
government at harvard university where dukakis once taught and 
where he turns for much of his foreign policy advice 
conflicting views of the world at the top of the administration 
were not reagans problem hess said he had a distinct point 
of view that the people who were working for him had no trouble 
following 
reagan survived several overseas debacles including the bombing 
of the marine corps barracks in beirut in 1983 but his handsoff 
management style contributed to the worst policy crisis of his 
administration the exchange of arms for hostages with iran 
clearly reagan has had trouble with national security 
advisers running through six in seven years said hess 
dukakis has not said publicly who he might appoint national 
security adviser or secretary of state if he is elected but among 
those often mentioned for those two important posts are allison and 
two colleagues from the kennedy school joseph nye and albert 
carnesdale along with madeleine albright a czechoslovakianborn 
georgetown university professor who served in the carter white 
house

president reagan contending the american 
people have had it with drug users and pushers today exhorted 
the senate to approve tough housepassed antidrug legislation 
before adjourning next week 
time is fast running out reagan said in his weekly radio 
address delivered from his weekend retreat at camp david md 
i want all americans to take heart this war is not yet won 
not by a long shot but we are doing better and our nation is 
united against this scourge as never before reagan said 
the house has passed one version of the legislation but the 
measure has not yet come before the full senate 
the house bill has many good and tough provisions that express 
our national commitment to five simple but powerful words those 
words are zero tolerance and just say no reagan said 
lifting the slogan from his wife nancys antidrug education 
campaign 
by zero tolerance we mean simply that weve had it reagan 
said we will no longer tolerate those who sell drugs and those 
who buy drugs 
all americans of good will are determined to stamp out those 
parasites who survive and even prosper by feeding off the energy 
and vitality and humanity of others they must pay he said 
reagan pointed out that the bill passed by the house earlier 
this month on a 37530 vote includes the death penalty for those 
who kill a law enforcement officer or authorizes the killing of 
anyone in a drugrelated crime 
we must we need and we will have this law he said 
reagan also put in a plug for vice president george bush 
calling the gop presidential candidate his point man on the 
administrations antidrug fight 
senators have been negotiating privately over crucial 
timelimiting agreements that would enable congress to pass the 
antidrug measure before adjournment expected to come at the end 
of next week 
a bipartisan group of sponsors introduced the drug measure in 
the senate on monday but they agreed the senate will run out of 
time if long debates ensue over controversial issues such as user 
penalties and allowing the admission in federal court of evidence 
seized illegally but in good faith

the setting sun was glaring into camera 
lenses it was late in the afternoon and michael dukakis was doing 
the main visual of his campaign day helping to destroy 
confiscated drugs at an incinerator in suburban detroit but few 
americans would ever see it 
the event was too late to make it onto the evening tv news the 
low angle of the sun made photographs difficult if not impossible 
and even those at the site squinting to see could not make out 
exactly what it was that the democratic presidential nominee was 
doing 
that same day rival george bush was on the scene for the 
majestic landing of the space shuttle discovery 
the two events and the way that campaign strategists set up 
their respective candidates participation in them helps dramatize 
the differences between the two campaigns although to be sure 
bush is able to capitalize on events he can attend like the 
discovery landing by virtue of his current office 
while the vice presidents campaign is by most accounts slick 
and polished the dukakis campaign remains according to critics 
uneven and sometimes amateurish 
some observers suggest that the number of seasoned veterans in 
bushs campaign beginning at the top with former treasury 
secretary james a baker iii a veteran of three past presidential 
campaigns is a prime reason for the skill and quick reaction time 
often shown by the gop campaign 
bakers guiding hand on the campaign of his longtime friend is 
also widely viewed as a main reason why bush has emerged since the 
gop convention in august as more aggressive and less frantic than 
he appeared before 
however observers also suggest that dukakis high command is 
improving on logistics and strategy particularly with the 
reappearance of veteran john sasso on labor day as the campaigns 
chief strategist 
susan estrich who worked in the presidential campaigns of 
walter mondale in 1984 and edward kennedy in 1980 remains dukakis 
campaign manager 
mike dukakis is an outsider whose team was largely composed of 
veterans of massachusetts politics and hes been slower to 
integrate the professionals said norman ornstein a political 
analyst with the conservative american enterprise institute 
ornstein said that bush is an insider who pulled in inside 
people around him 
the bush campaign over the past few weeks 
twice raided dukakis home state to pick up the endorsements 
of police organizations part of bushs effort to portray his rival 
as soft on crime 
moved quickly after the first nationally televised 
presidential debate to say that bush did not want to make women 
who seek abortions guilty of criminal activity even after he had 
left the issue vague 
has made the most of staged visual events to get on the 
evening news sticking to one message each day and reinforcing it 
with photogenic campaign events 
bush doesnt just show up at campaign events he makes 
entrances bands play thousands of balloons go up at a rally in 
owensboro ky last week bush arrived on a brightly decorated 
riverboat and traveling across illinois by bus he brought his own 
warmup group with him country singers crystal gayle and loretta 
lynn 
bushs campaign team is several layers deep 
his main campaign staff includes such professionals as campaign 
manager lee atwater an official in president reagans 1980 and 
1984 campaigns pollster robert s teeter who has worked on every 
presidential race for the past two decades and roger ailes who 
was chief media consultant for richard nixon in 1972 and for a host 
of gop candidates since 
the first team is augmented by gop consultants who dont draw a 
regular salary but whose expertise is routinely called on and who 
have narrow specific assignments 
for instance charles black who has worked two past 
presidential campaigns is currently focusing just on texas 
eddie mahe jr a longtime gop consultant has one job with the 
campaign studying dukakis daily campaign techniques and reporting 
back on which ones seem to be working 
richard bond bushs national political director was assigned 
to keep an eye on new jersey then over the past few days was 
reassigned to travel with gop vice presidential candidate dan 
quayle to oversee a program of damage control after the vice 
presidential debate 
he joins another political veteran stuart spencer who was 
assigned fulltime to quayle at the gop convention 
bush himself seldom gets involved with daytoday strategy 
dukakis does 
asked whether he had seen his recent campaign ads attacking 
quayle dukakis said are you kidding nothing goes on around 
here without me knowing 
meanwhile dukakis circle of toplevel advisers has been 
changing in part in reaction to democratic critics who said the 
campaign had not brought in experienced party leaders 
for instance dukakis on recent campaign trips has been 
accompanied by theodore c sorenson a former speechwriter to john 
kennedy 
also traveling with dukakis in recent days have been washington 
lawyers and longtime democratic political consultants stephen 
engelberg and peter edelman and robert schrum veteran of sen 
edward kennedys presidential bid has been brought in to bolster 
the speechwriting staff 
campaign chairman paul brountas travels nearly everywhere with 
dukakis he is a respected boston corporate lawyer and a longtime 
friend of dukakis his last national campaign experience was with 
edmund muskie 
francis obrien a veteran campaign aide and occasional movie 
producer has taken on a more visible role since the return of 
sasso obrien now travels with dukakis and is trying to coordinate 
the political message with what appears on television 
kirk odonnell a former aide to thenhouse speaker thomas p 
tip oneill was brought in last spring and given a large role 
in shaping the political message 
the campaign has also brought in a few aides from other 
democratic campaigns larry harrington political director for the 
albert gore campaign is dukakis southern coordinator richard 
moe a washington lawyer who was with gephardt is an occasional 
adviser donna brazille from the jesse jackson campaign sometimes 
travels with dukakis 
thomas donilon a top official with walter mondales 1984 
campaign helped coordinate debate preparation 
still few of these individuals have extensive experience in 
presidential campaigns 
i think the democrats have been behind on that for some time 
even though theyre beginning to catch up said bob beckel 
former campaign manager for mondale 
bush and his people used the period from the spring to the 
convention very well to bring in the best talent in their party 
and they made a much faster transition from the primary to the 
general election than did the dukakis campaign beckel said

a huge archive of longsecret documents 
of a family powerful in italy during the renaissance has been 
acquired by yale university and may give scholars a better 
understanding of 15th and 16thcentury europe 
the spinelli family were bankers and businessmen who held 
important offices in the florentine state family members also were 
generals in wars between italian citystates treasurers to popes 
spies and ambassadors the familys activities spanned four 
centuries 
the family even had business offices in rome venice barcelona 
lyons and london 
yale announced saturday that it obtained the collection in april 
through a swiss rare books dealer yale spokesman walter littell 
said he didnt know how much yale paid for it and said no further 
information would be made available about the deal 
the collection obtained by yales beinecke rare book and 
manuscript library comprises more than 150000 detailed records and 
chronicles that have never been studied by scholars and are 
virtually unknown to historians yale said 
the documents are among the most significant of any known 
italian archive said yale president benno c schmidt jr 
ralph w franklin beinecke director said the collection 
includes records of banking activities international trade and 
finance family life marriage slavery inheritance private 
wealth and patronage of charitable organizations 
the records also include detailed information about the business 
concerns of other families including the medicis and borgias 
i do not think history books on the period will be written 
again without mentioning the spinelli the spinellis relationships 
with the medici are well documented and the families even 
intermarried but the spinelli represent a completely different 
faction of florentine politics said robert g babcock the 
librarys edwin j beinecke curator of early books and manuscipts 
yale officials said the most significant document found in the 
collection is a 1440 record by tommaso spinelli treasurer for 
several popes in the 15th century it is his record of tax payments 
to the vatican by every diocese and abbey in the world and 
codifies the financial state of the church under eugenius iv who 
was pope from 14311447 
yale said it could take as long as four years to complete 
cataloging the documents some of them might be made available to 
scholars as early as january and an exhibition of some of the 
documents will open at the university in may

amid tears and grief thousands of people who 
have died of aids were memorialized saturday in ceremonies centered 
on a huge quilt made by friends and family members of the victims 
one of the most important things we get here today is the 
strength and sense of community we can feel and the knowledge that 
this terrible disease affects everyone said cleve jones 
director of the names project 
jones 34 is the founder of the san franciscobased 
commemorative project which involved making a huge fabric quilt 
that was spread out on the ellipse south of the white house 
the quilt five times larger than when it was displayed here 
last year contains 8288 handmade panels each in memory of a 
single person or group of people who have died of aids since 1981 
each of the panels measures three feet by six feet and all 50 
states and a dozen foreign countries are represented the panels 
are made from a variety of fabrics and many are elaborately 
decorated the 375000squarefoot quilt is bisected by walkways 
while hundreds of people walked among the panels on the sunny 
chilly morning volunteers read the names of thousands of aids 
victims 
one of the 495 volunteer readers was scheduled to be kitty 
dukakis wife of the democratic presidential candidate but her 
appearance was canceled because her flight to washington later 
saturday was delayed 
jones began the names project in 1986 after a friend died of 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
since then it has blossomed into a nationwide project and the 
quilt has been on a 20city tour in the past 18 months the quilt 
includes the names of about onefifth of the approximately 42000 
americans known to have died of aids since 1981 
its a very beautiful thing but its built on corpses 
jones said weve learned from the quilt that country is filled 
with good kind decent people who understand how to respond who 
understand that this is affecting all people regardless of their 
race background of sexuality 
jones said panels are still being accepted although he said 
organizers havent decided how many more panels to add to the 
quilt more than 10000 have been made and panels not added to the 
quilt were on display around the city in smaller quilts 
one of the visitors was lillian mello of san jose calif her 
23yearold son patrick died last christmas eve 
with tears in her eyes she wrote on a blank panel of the quilt 
i pray that mothers and fathers will love and stand by their sons 
and daughters even when they dont understand or accept their 
lifestyle she signed it a mother whos glad she did 
two of the readers were mayer and pat levy of st louis whose 
31yearold son died last year 
were doing this in memory of our son to help others levy 
said tearfully noting the quilt would help parents relieve their 
grief and acknowledge that their son was gay and passed away 
others like chris bates of washington dc simply wept 
i knew all of these people in new york san francisco and 
washington bates said between sobs they were my 
contemporaries im not 40 yet and all i talk about now is death 
my grandmother talks about death its not right

the ruling politburo is considering cutting the 
national budget and discussed making the ruble a convertible 
currency the communist party daily pravda said saturday 
the newspaper said the subjects were discussed thursday during a 
session on the 1989 budget 
pravda said the 12man politburo discussed steps to make the 
ruble a convertible currency it did not explain further 
some soviet economists have argued for making the ruble 
convertible so it could be transferred into other currencies on 
the world market 
this would remove a major stumbling block to trade but it would 
likely cause runaway inflation because the rubles value would drop 
the newspaper also did not give any details on the plans to cut 
the budget which is reportedly running at a deficit of more than 
100 billion it said only that there were plans to reduce 
expenses in all areas of the economy 
the newspaper sovietskaya rossiya reported last month that the 
country is running a budget deficit of at least 73 billion rubles 
or 116 billion the us budget deficit is 150 billion 
the soviet deficit amounts to about 15 percent of the budget 
which is about 773 billion sovietskaya rossiya said 
it blamed the deficit on the cost of cleaning up the chernobyl 
nuclear power plant disaster lower income to the state from 
slashed vodka sales and the falling price of oil the soviet union 
is the worlds biggest oil exporter 
pravda said that while the politburo wants to reduce expenses 
it also decided to improve the supply of food and consumer goods 
there were no details 
consumers surrounded soviet president mikhail s gorbachev on 
visit last month to siberia and complained that his plans for 
perestroika or restructuring of the economy and society have not 
solved chronic shortages of food and housing 
the politburo reviews the budget which is then rubber stamped 
by the supreme soviet or legislature the supreme soviet is 
scheduled to take up the budget in a session later this month

two coast guardsmen braved sixfoot 
waves and neargaleforce wind to swim out to rescue six people 
whose sailboat had been driven onto rocks during stormy weather 
the coast guard said saturday 
that boat was really taking a pounding in the surf said 
petty officer 3rd class william j murray we knew we had to take 
the people off right then and the only way to get to them was to 
send rescue swimmers to them through the surf 
the 38foot sloop triple creme headed from new york to newport 
was driven onto the rocks at point judith light late friday by a 
stiff east wind 
a coast guard petty officer who happened to look out the window 
of the point judith station saw the boat on the rocks amid waves 
that were topping six feet murray said 
petty officer 3rd class john c hunter of norton mass and 
seaman todd dillinger of fowlerville mich donned rubber suits 
lifejackets and swimmers harnesses and breasted the waves and 
35mph wind he said 
one at a time they ferried three of the people back to shore 
murray said 
hunter and dillinger then swam out to the boat again rigged its 
life raft and guided the raft and the other three occupants to 
safety he said 
it looked pretty hairy but everybody made it okay murray 
said 
everybody was fine a little wet and scared murray said 
he identified the rescued people as steve kaufman 24 and 
michael kim 25 of new york city patricia mi 25 and laura 
makatani 23 of washington joseph t seko 28 of middletown

three years ago with appropriate hoopla the 
space shuttle enterprise was carried piggyback on an airliner to 
dulles international airport to await the building of a museum that 
would become its permanent home 
there is no museum yet and according to rep bill nelson 
dfla there wont be one for at least five years 
i would like to propose a solution to this problem he wrote 
martin harwitt director of the national air and space museum last 
week it seems to me that there is an ideal alternative to 
keeping the enterprise in storage for the next five years an 
alternative that would make it available to many millions of people 
at this importrant time in the history of our civil space program 
nelsons solution take the enterprise back to whence it came 
the kennedy space center in florida which happens to be in 
nelsons congressional district 
the enterprise never flew in space and never shuttled it was a 
lame duck from the day it was manufactured it was used in drop 
tests to see how an orbiter would land unpowered and in fit 
tests to see how well it fit on its launch pad 
it was flown around the world on the back of nasas boeing 747 
and around this country where huge crowds gazed skyward at the 
unusual sight 
before being flown to dulles just outside of washington the 
enterprise had been an exhibit at the kennedy space center the 
cost of packing and unpacking the shuttle for that trip was 12 
million 
each year more than 25 million tourists visit the kennedy 
space center nelson wrote over a 5year period more than 12 
million people would have an opportunity to view this important 
symbol of american prowess in space this would seem to be of much 
greater value than simply keeping the enterprise in storage 
the shuttle is too big to be housed in the smithsonians air and 
space museum and the special building was to have been constructed 
at dulles 
there was no immediate reaction from the smithsonian

the biggest show of michelangelo drawings ever 
exhibited in this country will give americans a unique chance to 
judge a major argument among artlovers did he design a round dome 
for st peters in rome or the taller dome st peters now has 
like the us capitol 
originally the capitol built and rebuilt three centuries after 
st peters had a round dome 
the exhibit called michelangelo draftsmanarchitect opens 
sunday at the national gallery of art 
one of the people who put it all together was henry a millon 
dean of the museums center for advanced study in the visual arts 
he wrote in the catalogue that never before this exhibition has 
so much of the evidence on st peters dome been brought together 
if you are an angloamerican scholar or a german scholar you 
believe that michelangelo in the period 155861 built the model 
that he intended for st peters a model with a hemispherical 
inner and outer dome he told a news conference 
if you are an italian or french scholar you believe that 
after the model was finished in 1561 he changed his mind and 
decided to elevate the outer dome to the profile that it has 
today 
the wooden model itself 165 feet high and made under 
michelangelos direction is part of the exhibit it has the same 
elongated dome seen on the cathedral today 
but some scholars believe the shape of both the model and the 
actual dome was changed on the orders of giacomo della porta who 
finished the dome after michelangelos death 
also on show is a penandink drawing attributed to a frenchman 
etienne duperac from the period between michelangelos death and 
the completion of the dome it says 
this building following the design of michelangelo 
buonarotti will be finished in this manner 
it depicts a round dome not an elongated one 
another feature of the show is a newlyidentified michelangelo 
drawing of the suicide of cleopatra never shown publicly before 
among the unusual pieces is a drawing in black chalk of the 
torture of tityus a figure in greek mythology who was punished by 
having an enormous bird tear at his vitals michelangelo held the 
drawing up to the light traced it on the other side of the paper 
elimninated the bird added a roman soldier and presented the 
result as a resurrected christ 
the show will be open in the gallerys west building until dec 
11 after that the part of the show that consists mainly of figure 
drawings will go to the louvre in paris

george bush dogged by questions about his 
embattled running mate fought to keep the spotlight on his 
toughoncrime message saturday by collecting another 
lawenforcement endorsement 
after the event he said it was absolutely ludicrous to 
suggest his support of sen dan quayle has lagged since wednesday 
nights vice presidential debate 
bushs latest in a series of endorsement announcements came from 
dewey stokes president of the national fraternal order of police 
who called bush the law enforcement candidate 
while a fact sheet released by the campaign highlighted stokes 
role as head of the 197000member organization stating it is the 
largest lawenforcement group in the country stokes acknowledged 
that his endorsement was a personal one not representing the 
organization he said the group as a body would not make an 
endorsement before the election 
at the brief announcement outside bushs washington home bush 
and stokes acknowledged in response to reporters questions that 
they differ on at least one lawenforcement issue a waiting period 
to purchase a gun 
stokes group favors a federal law requiring a sevenday waiting 
period so that a purchasers record can be checked before he can 
buy a gun stokes said the waiting period is a common sense 
approach 
bush said i dont favor a federal waiting period i do favor 
the states having the right to do that noting that he differs 
with stokes he said we dont agree on every single issue but 
that is my position 
the vice president at first bypassing further questions as he 
has for the past 10 days turned to go back into his house but 
when someone shouted a question about how quayle was doing bush 
turned and said heatedly 
hes doing just fine just fine and i support him strongly 
let me say something about that this concept that i see in some of 
these reports that i am not supportive of dan quayle are absolutely 
ludicrous they are ridiculous 
although bushs references to quayle have diminished since his 
running mates debate wednesday night with democratic vice 
presidential nominee lloyd bentsen bush said it was erroneous 
reporting to suggest there is any meaning to that 
he did well in that debate he has my full support and he is 
getting strong support since the debate i made a good decision 
and the american people saw it in that debate 
bushs opponent massachusetts gov michael dukakis has 
intensified his criticism of quayle since the debate frequently 
belittling him in campaign speeches the dukakis campaign also has 
a new tv ad focusing on quayle 
bush continues to hammer dukakis as soft on crime with another 
anticrime speech slated for monday in new jersey 
on sunday bush was to campaign in chicago

september to 54 percent for all civilian workers and 53 percent 
when you include the military but behind these numbers is more 
good news 255000 got new jobs last month in the nonfarm sector 
which means that since the recovery began in 1982 over 18 million 
new jobs have been created theres nothing more pleasing than 
watching america move forward with purpose and the news reminds us 
yet again that this great nation is as senator dan quayle said 
the envy of the world 
now id like to turn to another subject the war on drugs i 
want all americans to take heart this war is not yet won not by a 
long shot but were doing better and our nation is united against 
this scourge as never before right now there is a drug bill on 
capitol hill it has passed the house but hasnt even come up for 
consideration in the senate and time is fast running out 
the house bill has many good and tough provisions that express 
our national commitment to five simple but powerful words those 
words are zero tolerance and just say no when we say zero 
tolerance we mean simply that weve had it we will no longer 
tolerate those who sell drugs and those who buy drugs all 
americans of good will are determined to stamp out those parasites 
who survive and even prosper by feeding off the energy and vitality 
and humanity of others they must pay 
we believe that when those who sell drugs are caught they must 
make redress for the damage they cause thats why the 
administration personified by the leadership and passion of this 
administrations point man on drugs vice president george bush 
and the national voice of conscience my wife nancy has advocated 
tougher measures than ever before to combat the drug runners and 
the drug dealers 
we are doing this by seizing the illgotten possessions of drug 
dealers and their accomplices those fancy cars and fancy houses 
and bank accounts full of dirty money arent really theirs they 
were bought from the sale of illegal blood pollutants we do not 
tolerate companies that poison our harbors and rivers and we wont 
let people who are poisoning the blood of our children get away 
with it either 
those who have the gall to use federally subsidized housing to 
peddle their toxins must get the message as well we will not 
tolerate those who think they can do their dirty work in the same 
quarters where disadvantaged americans struggle to build a better 
life we want to kick the vermin out and keep them out 
nor can we allow these people to hide behind bizarre legal 
challenges when we do arrest them and we must work to see them 
jailed and thats why were advocating a change in the law that 
will allow exceptions in the socalled exclusionary rule to 
permit the use in court of evidence gathered in good faith by the 
police nor can our vigilance cease once theyre behind bars 
george bush has proposed and i support drug testing for all 
who seek early release from jail to send them this message you 
dont go free until youre drug free we wont have a drugfree 
society until we manage to stop the drugs before they get to our 
shores we must protect our coasts and that means using the 
resources and calling on the noble men and women of the coast guard 
to protect us 
weve sought increases in the drug enforcement budget but in 
the past weve encountered consistent resistance from congress i 
requested 538 million for the drug enforcement adminstration in 
fiscal 1989 but congress hacked 33 million away 
i think drug enforcement is too important a matter for this kind 
of political behavior and i imagine you agree with me but there 
is a way more vital than all of these that we can express our 
revulsion at violence and degradation of the life of the drug 
peddler these people seem to feel nothing no fear no remorse 
nothing when they pull out a machine gun and murder a police 
officer in the line of duty 
the bill that has passed the house provides for the death 
penalty for these vicious killers we must we need and we will 
have this law now there are those whove opposed the house bill 
because it includes the death penalty others oppose it because of 
the goodfaith exception to the exclusionary rule 
i believe these people are more concerned with the abstract 
rights of criminals than the right of our society to save itself 
from those in this country and outside who seek their fortune in 
our national misfortune 
i challenge the us senate to get that bill passed the nation 
demands it and theres no time to waste compromises on the key 
provisions are unacceptable we must let the drug kingpins know 
your days are numbered our cause is just and we will triumph 
until next week thanks for listening god bless you

part of puget sound has been closed to 
shellfishing because of shellfish poisoning or red tide and 
shellfish from the area are being pulled from store shelves in 
eight states officials said 
while northern beaches along puget sound are routinely closed 
due to red tide this is the first time southern beaches have been 
closed because of contaminated shellfish said gary plews 
shellfish supervisor for the state department of social and health 
services 
this is the first time paralytic shellfish poisoning has 
been found south of the tacoma narrows bridge at such high 
levels he said 
officials said testing was intensified after a 57yearold port 
orchard woman was treated for the illness after eating contaminated 
oysters from the area a week ago 
shellfish poisoning is caused by an invisible odorless and 
tasteless organism that grows naturally in shellfish tissue and 
multiplies rapidly in warmer water it does not threaten dother sea 
life but it can sicken and even kill people who eat elevated 
levels of the toxin 
it is called red tide because of the reddish discoloration of 
sea water caused by the organism 
state and federal agencies said the ban on shellfishing applies 
to sport and commercial fishermen and includes all clams oysters 
mussels and scallops 
state officials said in a news release that all commercial 
shellfish taken from the affected area since oct 1 were being 
removed from wholesale and retail sale and will be tested for the 
toxin 
south puget sound commercial shellfish go to wholesalers and 
retailers in washington california oregon alaska hawaii 
pennsylvania maine and new york 
south puget sound produces twothirds of the puget sound 
harvest and washington state is the nations largest oyster 
producer 
symptoms of shellfish poisoning include vomiting nausea muscle 
weakness and tingling of lips mouth and teeth the news release 
said loss of balance and lack of muscular coordination can follow 
those struck generally do not die but elderly people and those 
with other medical conditions can be affected more severely

the foreign ministers of iran and iraq 
have agreed in principle to a un proposal to end their 8yearold 
war iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati said saturday 
iraqi officials indicated that the 6weekold peace talks remain 
deadlocked 
velayati interviewed by the official islamic republic news 
agency as he flew back to tehran from new york said negotiators 
from both sides agreed that iran and iraq would withdraw their 
troops within 15 days to prewar borders and exchange war prisoners 
several hours after irna reported velayatis comments iraqs 
minister of state for foreign affairs saddoum hamadi declared 
that iraq will not relinquish even one inch of its territory to 
iran 
the official iraqi news agency quoted hamadi as telling a 
meeting of iraqs ruling baath arab socialist party that iraq 
imposed its will of peace on iran from a position of strength 
both reports were monitored in nicosia cyprus 
hamadi made no direct reference to velayatis comments but a 
senior iraqi official who spoke on condition of anonymity told 
the associated press the peace talks remain blocked 
he said the obstacle was irans refusal to agree to iraqs 
demand that the disputed shatt alarab waterway which forms the 
southern boundary between the gulf foes be cleared for navigation 
before further negotiations can be held 
both sides have repeatedly accused each other of stalling in the 
unmediated negotiations that began aug25 in geneva and moved to 
new york the talks began after both sides accepted a un security 
council resolution calling for a ceasefire 
iraqi officials have accused the united states and its european 
allies of softening their hostility toward iran since the aug20 
ceasefire began because they want a stake in lucrative contracts 
in irans massive postwar reconstruction 
velayati said that iran has agreed to drop its right to search 
ships in the strait of hormuz the only gateway to the strategic 
persian gulf 
iran had claimed that until a formal peace treaty was signed it 
was in a state of war with iraq and had the right to search vessels 
sailing into the gulf to determine whether they carried warrelated 
materials for iraq 
iraq has disputed this but apart from one iraqi vessel that was 
harrassed immediately after the ceasefire there have been no 
reports of any other iraqi vessels or ships heading for iraqi 
ports being stopped by the iranians 
velayati said the talks in new york under the supervision of 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar and his special 
representative jan eliasson were more successful than two 
previous rounds in geneva 
he did not say when the reported agreement would take effect 
but irna quoted him as questioning whether the iraqi delegation 
had the authority to seal any pact 
he complained that the iraqis led by foreign minister tariq 
aziz did not have sufficient authority to make decisions 
in order to be successful the parties involved must have the 
authority and the decisionmaking power otherwise talks will not 
progress and will become more complicated velayati said 
the iraqi delegates feel somewhat confused as to what they 
should do he added

house speaker jim wrights claim that he 
performed a public service by criticizing a covert cia operation in 
nicaragua has renewed debate over whether secrecy is sometimes used 
to hide policies of dubious merit 
wright touched off a hot debate three weeks ago when he accused 
the spy agency of stirring up civil unrest in nicaragua to provoke 
a crackdown by the leftist sandinista government as authority for 
his statement he cited clear cia testimony before congress 
the house ethics committee now is investigating whether the 
texas democrat indirectly received classified material given by the 
cia to the intelligence committee then violated the chambers 
rules against public disclosure of classified information wright 
has contended he did not 
of course we have to protect genuine government secrets 
wright who as speaker has access to the nations most sensitive 
secrets said last week but a democracy must never allow secrecy 
to be used as a cloak to hide bad policy from the public 
but those who deal routinely with topsecret information the 
members of the house and senate intelligence committees say the 
notion that one lawmaker can decide to speak out about a covert 
operation is dangerous 
if you allowed every individual member to make his own 
judgments about revealing classified information it would be the 
end of our system said sen david boren dokla chairman of 
the senate intelligence committee boren said he was not commenting 
directly on the wright case but was speaking of broad principles 
all discipline would break down because theres virtually no 
policy around here thats unanimous even in a democracy there are 
things that have to be kept secret boren said congress risks 
being shut out of participation in foreign policy formulation if it 
cant keep secrets he said 
highly advanced us technologies that cost millions of dollars 
to develop are an example of secrets that must be kept 
intelligence officials say delicate us relationships with the 
intelligence services of other nations also depend on secrecy and 
lives can be at stake if secrecy of covert operations is breached 
they note 
in the case of wrights disclosure house conservatives have 
argued that the speaker placed members of the nicaraguan political 
opposition in jeopardy by linking them to the cia and handed the 
sandinistas a propaganda bonanza 
covert operations are actions designed to influence events in 
other countries while hiding the involvement of the united states 
they range from smallscale actions involving no more than a 
handful of people to major paramilitary efforts like us support 
of the contras or of the antisoviet afghan rebels 
most members of congress agree that such actions sometimes are 
necessary particularly where normal diplomatic solutions are 
impossible but boren cautioned that they must be chosen carefully 
the united states should not covertly do things that conflict with 
publicly stated policies or generally held us values he said 
it was cia abuses in the 1960s and 70s planning for 
assassinations of foreign leaders and domestic spying that led to 
creation of house and senate intelligence committees a dozen years 
ago to pass judgment on the spy agencys most sensitive activities 
in defending his comments wright said he was simply 
highlighting that sort of duplicity in the administrations 
behavior giving lip service to peace talks between the government 
and the contras while at the same time making a secret attempt to 
undermine those talks by provoking civil unrest 
wrights criticism also could be taken as an indirect complaint 
about his own intelligence oversight panel which under the law 
would have to have been notified by the cia about the covert action 
intelligence committee members have a variety of remedies if 
they disagree with a proposed covert operation 
since they authorize all cia spending one year at a time they 
can threaten to cut off money for the activity or include legal 
language barring it the cias contingency fund once as large as 
50 million was cut to roughly half that amount in recent years 
because of a desire for more congressional control 
committee members also debate covert action proposals and often 
can head them off if there is widespread bipartisan opposition the 
cia prefers to have congressional support so that it wont be left 
out in the cold should a covert action become public 
in wrights case he said he had known about the activity since 
august 1987 and had repeatedly argued against it privately without 
effect 
congress least used most potent and perhaps ultimate weapon 
against a covert action is a threat to go public 
thats the only real hammer said rep george brown 
dcalif who left the intelligence committee last year in a 
dispute with the pentagon over its classification practices 
theres nothing morally wrong in supporting forces in any part 
of the world that reflect the goals of a democratic country said 
brown but you move from that principle down a slippery slope 
rapidly you start creating forces to reflect your democratic 
values you let it get out of control you start paying people 
who dont give a damn about your morals 
wright he said was speaking on behalf of a majority in 
congress who would have preferred to see us interests in 
nicaragua served through a negotiated peace and not through what 
they see as provocation 
but sen william cohen rmaine said wright was wrong to go 
public even if it was in an offthecuff remark cohen was 
particularly stung by the wright incident because it doomed chances 
for his bill to tighten congressional oversight of covert 
operations 
there is nothing to prevent him from going down and talking to 
the president oneonone calling the head of the cia the 
secretary of state cohen said there are a number of ways to 
do it jim wright is not the president of the united states and 
the president bears responsibility for the decisions

the radiationcontaminated town of chernobyl near 
the site of the worlds worst nuclear accident is being razed 
because it wont be fit for human habitation for decades pravda 
said saturday 
officials even plan to erase the chernobyl adminstrative region 
by eliminating communist party and government bodies in the area 
and transferring seven villages to a neighboring region the 
newspaper reported 
that will be the end to the chernobyl problem pravda noted 
in an article that objected to the plans 
pravda complained that local authorities are taking drastic 
action without trying hard enough to clean up the 800yearold 
town it questioned why the decision was made without prior 
announcement and without consulting the people who wanted to go 
back to the area to live 
pravda said the towns fate was decided by the local atomic 
energy ministry combine and the newspaper suggested the academy of 
sciences or higher government organs should have been involved in 
the decision 
chernobyl once home to 10000 people was evacuated in april 
1986 after a fire at the power plant with the same name spewed 
radiation worldwide officials said 31 people were killed 
the radiation situation in chernobyl is such that full life of 
people cannot resume for decades v komarov chief engineer of 
the nuclear power agency now running the power plant was quoted as 
saying 
local authorities in the town which is 11 miles from the plant 
burned one house and then bulldozed two streets of homes in the 
central district the communist party newspaper said some of the 
buildings were just three years old 
at first authorities planned to tear down only dilapidated 
houses komarov wrote in a power plant newspaper quoted by pravda 
but by the time normal life can return all the houses will be 
equally dilapidated and living in them will be impossible he was 
quoted as saying there will be scarcely anything to preserve at 
all 
pravda noted that the town of gden is about the same distance 
from the power plant as chernobyl and has been decontaminated and 
repopulated 
in the revitalized byelorussian town new water lines were set 
down streets repaved roofs were replaced and all 245 families 
returned six months after the accident pravda said 
there is not a single such example in the ukrainian part of 
the danger zone even though the wind brought more radioactivity 
to byelorussia than to the ukraine after the accident the 
newspaper said 
pravda also reported that 994 people mostly middleaged and 
elderly have defied bans and moved back into the ukrainian section 
of the danger zone an 18mile radius from the accident site 
reports this spring said 100 people had returned to chernobyl 
itself but pravda said they were given no consideration in the 
decision to raze the town 
gamma background radiation levels in chernobyl were 01 
milliroentgen per hour as of june equal to the natural 
radioactivity in mountainous areas and twice that of the ukrainian 
capital of kiev to the south the newspaper said 
kiev regional officials said last year that at least 27 towns 
and villages were too contaminated to be populated in the 
foreseeable future a new town for workers at the power plant was 
built 35 miles from chernobyl

violent riots sweeping this north 
african arab nation grew out of years of frustration with the rigid 
socialist system and a declining economy that has created a growing 
crowd of jobless youth 
the precise motives and causes of different groups of rioters in 
the past several days have been difficult to disentangle 
a shadowy islamic fundamentalist movement on saturday said it 
started the unrest and warned it would unleash even greater 
violence unless its demands are met 
the previously unknown movement for algerian renewal 
presented a series of demands including satisfying the immediate 
needs of the population and replacing the government of president 
chadli bendjedid 
since a 1965 military coup algeria has been under a stern 
sovietstyle government the constitution declares islam the state 
religion but says socialism is the only path to independence 
the revolt began tuesday with spontaneous acts of violence by 
youngsters without any distinct political or social cause their 
slogans attacked the high cost of living and the fat cats 
living in luxury but they offered no remedies some chants 
supported competing algerian soccer teams 
moslem fundamentalists recognizable in the fastliving capital 
by their beards and flowing white robes began taking over the 
movement thursday small groups of them were seen taking the lead 
of violent crowds and pointing out the luxury stores and 
restaurants for the wealthy as suitable targets for the masses 
wrath 
but later the moslems were seen reasoning with the crowd and 
encouraging them to disperse peacefully 
with the armys tanks and armored personnel carriers deployed at 
strategic points throughout the capital and troops with fixed 
bayonets ready to shoot to maintain public order the older and 
more experienced fundamentalists had no difficulty getting their 
point across 
on saturday they flung off the veil and proclaimed themselves 
the leaders of the movement of revolt in a statement 
distributed to news organizations 
but it was not known whether the islamic fundamentalists 
actually set the protests in motion or were rushing to the front to 
try to lead the parade in the direction they preferred 
so far the fundamentalist movement is alone in its attempt to 
make political capital out of the revolt 
no one has demanded a limitation of the soaring birthrate or 
measures to cope with unemployment which has reached 40 percent in 
the larger cities the fundamentalists have been reluctant to 
address these deeper causes of popular discontent 
their demand for the removal of the government did not include 
the ouster of bendjedid personally falling in line with the 
widespread feeling that responsibility for the regimes failures 
lies not with the president but with the fat cats conspiring to 
obstruct his policies 
the president has been the main advocate of an economic 
austerity program permitting algeria to live within its means 
during a period of low prices for oil and gas which make up 97 
percent of algerias exports 
nearly 60 percent of algerias 25 million people are less than 
20 years old in the middle of the demographic explosion bendjedid 
has fought opposition within the national liberation front the 
only legal party to move away from a strictly governmentdirected 
economy 
under the austerity program prices on many formerly subsidized 
goods have risen 40 percent since january a block of butter that 
cost 50 cents 10 months ago for example now costs almost a dollar 
on saturday the army continued to move troops into the major 
cities and the military command issued repeated warnings for 
people to remain off the streets 
shopkeepers took no chances and began lowering curtains and 
barring shop fronts shortly after noon on saturday algeria 
operates on an islamic week and saturday and sunday are normally 
working days

homeowner toni dejonge can 
empathize with state officials who say its difficult to convince 
people that colorless odorless radioactive radon gas collecting in 
their homes can be deadly 
i brought it up last year at the voting booths and they 
laughed me out onto the street they said dont be ridiculous 
its all a scam said ms dejonge tests conducted last year 
found that her home had radon levels 45 times the federal safety 
standard 
ms dejonge lives in the whispering hills development where 
tests sept 30 found 60 of 75 homes had radon levels above the 
federal safety standard one home had levels 800 times greater then 
the federal standard possibly the highest ever recorded in a 
house officials said thursday 
officials believe the gas in clinton township a rural community 
about 40 miles west of new york city rises through the ground from 
the reading prong a formation of uraniumbearing rock that extends 
from pennsylvania into new york radon is produced by the 
radioactive decay of uranium 
health officials say radon is second only to smoking as a cause 
of lung cancer deaths 
last year ms dejonge installed a simple ventilation system in 
her basement for 950 to alleviate the radon problem and became 
the town radon crier 
she gave up after consistently meeting with derision from 
neighbors who thought it was a hoax perpetrated by the burgeoning 
radon remediation industry 
the federal standard for radon is 4 picocuries a unit of 
radiation measurement the federal environmental protection agency 
estimates that level is the annual equivalent of smoking onehalf 
pack of cigarettes a day or having 200 to 300 chest xrays 
one lhouse tested by the state department of environmental 
protection in the whispering hills development registered 3500 
picocuries state officials said the unidentified homeowner was 
having the problem corrected 
state officials canvassed the neighborhood last weekend urging 
residents to place charcoalfilled canisters in their basements to 
test for the gas 
but at many homes they met with slammed doors suspicion 
reluctance or skepticism others said they have tested but put 
off having work done to lower radon levels because they distrust 
what may be hype 
state officials say they continue to battle apathy despite 
discoveries of 18 similar clusters in the state where radon is 
seeping through house foundations and building to dangerous levels 
calls to a state radon hot line increase tenfold after flurries 
of publicity such as reports last month that 29 percent of homes 
in seven states had elevated radon levels but the calls quickly 
drop off officials said 
its not a problem you can see its not a problem that can be 
associated with a manmade contamination problem its a natural 
phenomenon thats been here all along said david martin vice 
president of teledyne isotopes a radioactive testing firm radon 
poses the highest risk to smokers and if you cant convince people 
to stop smoking its going to be hard to interest them in radon

here is the text of saturdays democratic 
radio address by sen daniel p moynihan dny 
this is senator pat moynihan of new york and im here to 
present the democratic response to president reagans weekly radio 
address 
this past year has been one of considerable even historic 
bipartisan cooperation here in the nations capital we have sent 
the president a hugely important trade bill catastrophic health 
insurance and after onehalf century at long last welfare reform 
mr president youve invited me to the rose garden thursday 
afternoon when youll sign the welfare bill and so ill see you 
then but this is the last time we will have this exchange on a 
saturday so i would like to talk about one last great bipartisan 
effort we could have together 
this is the omnibus drug bill which we introduced in the senate 
on monday today you talked about the house bill ill talk about 
the senate bill may i say we surprised ourselves over the last 
few years as the most recent drug epidemic has spread across the 
nation there have been all too familiar efforts to make this a 
partisan issue as if one party knew more about how to cope with 
the emergency or cared more or would spend more or would punish 
more or just plain demagogue more most of which ended in 
stalemate and namecalling 
this time we decided we could do better in may senate majority 
leader robert c byrd appointed me and senator nunn of georgia to 
head a democratic working group senate republican leader bob dole 
appointed senators rudman damato wilson and gramm to do 
likewise the two groups met and we learned to our surprise just 
how much we agreed 
first we agreed that there is an epidemic it is primarily 
associated with crack a derivative of cocaine which first 
appeared in the bahamas in 1983 by 1985 it had reached new york 
city by 1986 kansas city and then across the country since then 
hospital emergency room admissions due to illicit drugs have 
increased tenfold 
one half of all juveniles in detention at this moment are the 
result of drugrelated crimes almost half of juveniles arrested 
have been arrested at least five times we agreed that the federal 
government has a major responsibility here these drugs come into 
the country illegally if the federal government did not prevent 
their entry it must help with their aftermath 
first then a drug czar a member of the cabinet to lead this 
effort next a real effort our interdiction program is pathetic 
when you think what is needed when we started the drug enforcement 
administration we created some 2100 special agents fifteen years 
later there are not quite 2900 federal aid to street law 
enforcement has all but disappeared there are not nearly enough 
federal prosecutors or federal prisons 
above all there is almost no federal support for treatment we 
dont know much about treatment for crack but we do know that 
young people who get into drugs soon wish they could get out and 
there are millions of them one american in 10 has used an illicit 
drug in the last month clearly we must provide treatment on 
request whatever you do in an epidemic you dont close your 
hospitals 
and so mr president on monday we introduced a bipartisan 
600page 26 billion drug bill it marks a major departure in 
federal policy we allocate 40 percent of funds to the supply side 
which is to say programs such as crop eradication and border 
interdiction there is a death penalty eviction forfeiture a 
threetime loser life sentence 
but 60 percent of the funds go to the demand side testing 
education treatment senator byrd and senator dole are the lead 
sponsors among the many cosponsors you will find senator quayle 
and senator bentsen 
we need your help we have four legislative days left in the 
100th congress we cant pass the house bill it has just too many 
extras some of which you mentioned but we can pass the senate 
bill and the house will take a clean bill and so i would ask mr 
president send word that you will sign the senate bill and well 
get it to your desk and so good day good luck to us all

my fellow americans youre probably just as delighted as i am 
with the wonderful news about unemployment that we received 
yesterday the unemployment rate dropped fully twotenths of a 
percent in september to 54 percent for all civilian workers and 
53 percent when you include the military but behind these numbers 
is more good news 255000 got new jobs last month in the nonfarm 
sector which means that since the recovery began in 1982 over 18 
million new jobs have been created theres nothing more pleasing 
than watching america move forward with purpose and the news 
reminds us yet again that this great nation is as senator dan 
quayle said the envy of the world 
now id like to turn to another subject the war on drugs i 
want all americans to take heart this war is not yet won not by a 
long shot but were doing better and our nation is united against 
this scourge as never before right now there is a drug bill on 
capitol hill it has passed the house but hasnt even come up for 
consideration in the senate and time is fast running out 
the house bill has many good and tough provisions that express 
our national commitment to five simple but powerful words those 
words are zero tolerance and just say no when we say zero 
tolerance we mean simply that weve had it we will no longer 
tolerate those who sell drugs and those who buy drugs all 
americans of good will are determined to stamp out those parasites 
who survive and even prosper by feeding off the energy and vitality 
and humanity of others they must pay 
we believe that when those who sell drugs are caught they must 
make redress for the damage they cause thats why the 
administration personified by the leadership and passion of this 
administrations point man on drugs vice president george bush 
and the national voice of conscience my wife nancy has advocated 
tougher measures than ever before to combat the drug runners and 
the drug dealers 
we are doing this by seizing the illgotten possessions of drug 
dealers and their accomplices those fancy cars and fancy houses 
and bank accounts full of dirty money arent really theirs they 
were bought from the sale of illegal blood pollutants we do not 
tolerate companies that poison our harbors and rivers and we wont 
let people who are poisoning the blood of our children get away 
with it either 
those who have the gall to use federally subsidized housing to 
peddle their toxins must get the message as well we will not 
tolerate those who think they can do their dirty work in the same 
quarters where disadvantaged americans struggle to build a better 
life we want to kick the vermin out and keep them out 
nor can we allow these people to hide behind bizarre legal 
challenges when we do arrest them and we must work to see them 
jailed and thats why were advocating a change in the law that 
will allow exceptions in the socalled exclusionary rule to 
permit the use in court of evidence gathered in good faith by the 
police nor can our vigilance cease once theyre behind bars 
george bush has proposed and i support drug testing for all 
who seek early release from jail to send them this message you 
dont go free until youre drug free we wont have a drugfree 
society until we manage to stop the drugs before they get to our 
shores we must protect our coasts and that means using the 
resources and calling on the noble men and women of the coast guard 
to protect us 
weve sought increases in the drug enforcement budget but in 
the past weve encountered consistent resistance from congress i 
requested 538 million for the drug enforcement administration in 
fiscal 1989 but congress hacked 33 million away 
i think drug enforcement is too important a matter for this kind 
of political behavior and i imagine you agree with me but there 
is a way more vital than all of these that we can express our 
revulsion at violence and degradation of the life of the drug 
peddler these people seem to feel nothing no fear no remorse 
nothing when they pull out a machine gun and murder a police 
officer in the line of duty 
the bill that has passed the house provides for the death 
penalty for these vicious killers we must we need and we will 
have this law now there are those whove opposed the house bill 
because it includes the death penalty others oppose it because of 
the goodfaith exception to the exclusionary rule 
i believe these people are more concerned with the abstract 
rights of criminals than the right of our society to save itself 
from those in this country and outside who seek their fortune in 
our national misfortune 
i challenge the us senate to get that bill passed the nation 
demands it and theres no time to waste compromises on the key 
provisions are unacceptable we must let the drug kingpins know 
your days are numbered our cause is just and we will triumph 
until next week thanks for listening god bless you

a chemical cleanup crew planned to blow up a 
rusting cylinder sunday without knowing for sure what was inside or 
if it could explode prematurely and officials asked 3500 
residents to evacuate just in case 
the 4footlong container at the defunct artel chemical co 
plant could contain up to 30 pounds of hydrogen cyanide gas 
federal environmental protection agency officials said 
hydrogen cyanide is one of the most poisonous substances made 
says mercks index a directory of chemicals and drugs as little 
as 50 milligrams or a quantity onesixth the size of an aspirin 
can kill an adult the book says 
sundays plan was for three men to weigh the corroded tank 
carry it 100 yards to a bunker split the sides with explosives and 
start a gasolineanddiesel fire to destroy the contents 
but just moving the tank could trigger a reaction that would 
cause an explosion before the men could reach the bunker federal 
officials said the workers are from jet research center inc of 
mansfield texas 
as a precaution the epa and mayor don karnes asked a third of 
the towns 9000 residents to stay away from their homes between 
1230 pm and 5 pm they planned to have 120 public officials on 
hand to bus residents to a school gymnasium and to evacuate the 
elderly and handicapped to hospitals and nursing homes 
a lot of people are callous toward this thing karnes said 
friday of residents of an area that has had chemical plants for 
decades they have been raised with chemicals and they dont see 
anything wrong with this 
i have asked them to go as a favor to me ive known a lot of 
these people for years if they wont go ive asked them to leave 
their fingerprints and dental records for identification 
if the cylinder is empty all will be fine said jerry heston of 
the epa coordinator of the governments cleanup at the plant 
the primary question is is it full or empty or what 
heston said 
chemical stabilizers added to the tanks contents may have 
deteriorated and pressure inside may be slowly rising heston said 
hydrogen cyanide is used as a raw material by chemical 
companies forming the base for such things as acrylic waxes and 
food packaging and to kill rodents and insects in ship holds 
a plan to destroy the cylinder sept 25 fell through and the 
evacuation was called off when workers hired to move the container 
balked a new company was hired for sundays procedure 
the artel plant formerly was owned by elmer fike a 35year 
maker of specialty chemicals fike openly criticized 
environmental regulations saying they were too restrictive and 
his plant often resembled a jerrybuilt brewery with rusted pipes 
linking massive tanks 
artel bought the plant from fike when the company was unable to 
pay workers a judge ordered the plant shut the epa stepped in to 
dispose of the 3400 drums and barrels at the site 
nothing is known for certain about the tank slated for 
destruction except that it was built more than 20 years ago and 
hasnt been moved or used in nearly seven years 
its probably a possibility that something else might be 
inside but elmer fike has told me that it has hydrogen cyanide 
in it or nothing at all karnes said i certainly have no 
reason to doubt that 
if moving the tank triggers a reaction the demolition experts 
will have to act fast 
if the cylinder starts getting hot they will have a minute 
minuteandahalf to put it down heston said weve made 
sandbag stands they can just set it down set up the detonation 
cord get offsite put an airpack on and pop it 
pop it means blowing one end off the tank relieving 
pressure and preventing a rupture that could send shrapnel into 
other tanks at the site 
we would then have hydrogen cyanide released to the 
atmosphere heston said we assume the whole 30 pounds would go 
up in the air and weve done air flow models to find out where it 
would go thats why we recommended the 1000yard evacuation 
zone 
forcing an evacuation hasnt been easy for karnes 
some residents dont want to be bothered either because of 
their trust in the chemical industry in the heavily industrialized 
kanawha valley or because they agreed to leave their homes sept 
25 when the operation was first scheduled but then canceled 
karnes says there are only three things that can cause another 
cancellation bad weather stagnant air or if not enough people 
leave town 
ive had people calling from 1 miles away asking me if they 
should leave karnes said im telling them theyre perfectly 
safe but that they can leave if they want to 
i cant tell them to stay and then have a cloud go out and 
kill 9000 people

federal drug administration tests on 
candy believed to poisoned with strychnine were unable to identify 
the substance and the agency is still investigating an agency 
spokesman said saturday 
a powder was found on a piece of candy in a package of sunkist 
fun fruits and dinosaurs bought at a northern new jersey grocery 
store bergen county prosecutor larry mcclure said friday that 
state police laboratory tests had determined the powder was 
strychnine 
but fda spokesman edward wilkens said the agencys lab in 
brooklyn ny was unable to confirm the powder was strychnine he 
said only a small piece of the candy in question was available for 
testing and officials were trying to determine why the results 
from the two labs differed 
our lab isnt sure what it is wilkens said they seem to 
think they had enough and if it was strychnine the lab workers 
think they would have detected it 
fda officials have completed an inspection of the thomas h 
lipton inc plant in flemington where the candy was packaged and 
plants in california illinois and oklahoma also will be inspected 
for traces of strychnine wilkens said 
the fbi is in charge of the investigation he said 
lipton spokesman david st clair initially said the powder most 
likely was harmless cornstarch that could have come from a mold 
which is made of cornstarch 
mcclure did not immediately respond to a message left at his 
home 
strychnine is commonly used in rodent killer and may cause 
deaths in small doses or can cause violent convulsions loss of 
muscle control intense pain and impaired respiration 
the candy in question was packaged aug 4 and the number on the 
outside of the box is 8h04ef those boxes will still be recalled as 
an extra precaution st clair said 
the batch was distributed in an area ranging from massachusetts 
to florida and west to ohio mcclure said friday 
henry heide co in new brunswick made the candy for lipton 
which packaged and distributed the boxes under the sunkist label 
he said

president reagan warned congress on saturday 
that time is fast running out and pressed the senate to 
approve a housepassed antidrug bill before adjournment 
reagan as he has in several other speeches during the past 
week said he supports the death penalty provision in the measure 
but in the democratic response sen daniel moynihan dny 
praised the senates version as the better legislation and argued 
the house bill has just too many extras 
the house bill has many good and tough provisions that express 
our national commitment to five simple but powerful words those 
words are zero tolerance and just say no reagan said 
lifting the slogan from his wife nancys antidrug education 
campaign 
by zero tolerance we mean simply that weve had it reagan 
said in his weekly radio address from camp david md 
we will no longer tolerate those who sell drugs and those who 
buy drugs all americans of good will are determined to stamp out 
those parasites who survive and even prosper by feeding off the 
energy and vitality and humanity of others they must pay the 
president said 
reagan said he supports moves to deny federal benefits to anyone 
convicted of drug sales or use user penalties and allowing the 
admission in federal court of evidence seized illegally but in 
good faith 
while the house passed its version of the legislation earlier 
this month on a 37530 vote the measure has not yet come before 
the senate 
we must we need and we will have this law the president 
said i challenge the us senate to get that bill passed 
reagan pointed out that the house bill includes the death 
penalty for those who authorize drugrelated killings or anyone who 
kills a law enforcement officer in a drugrelated crime 
moynihan noted the senate legislation also has the death penalty 
provision but spends 60 percent of its 26 billion package to 
reduce demand and only 40 percent for cutting supply 
it marks a major departure in federal policy noted moynihan 
the bill introduced in the senate last monday has wide 
bipartisan backing moynihan noted included the support of the gop 
vice president candidate sen dan quayle of indiana 
as he has done in many radio addresses reagan put in a plug for 
vice president george bush calling the gop presidential candidate 
his point man on the administrations antidrug fight 
the president said he backed bushs move to require that any 
prisoner must be proven drugfree before being released from jail 
you dont go free until youre drug free reagan said 
senators have been negotiating privately over crucial 
timelimiting agreements that would enable congress to pass the 
antidrug measure before adjournment expected to come at the end 
of this week 
but they agree the senate will run out of time if long debates 
ensue over controversial issues such as the user penalties or the 
admission of illegally seized evidence 
even if the senate overcame its time obstacles it still would 
need time to reach a compromise with the house and the measure 
even if enacted faces serious financing problems 
the senate bill is a twoyear package that would authorize about 
2 billion in new spending but only 450 million may be available 
immediately according to several sponsors of the legislation 
moynihan urged reagan to send word that you will sign the 
senate bill and well get it to your desk

police arrested 40 abortion protesters saturday 
at the end of a fiveday siege of atlanta that landed more than 
450 demonstrators in jail but it was not clear who if anyone won 
theyll be back and well be here every day they are 
predicted police maj kenneth burnette police were criticized for 
rough handling of demonstrators on the first three days of the 
weeks protests but used gentler tactics on the last two days 
more than 1100 antiabortion demonstrators have been jailed in 
atlanta since a group called operation rescue began picketing and 
blocking entrances to abortion clinics during the democratic 
national convention in july 
the group has called a national day of rescue for oct 29 
and hopes to have demonstrations in 100 cities 
operation rescue said it would file a civil rights suit next 
week in us district court against the city of atlanta on behalf 
of the rev doyle clark of hudson ind who said he suffered 
serious injuries and inadequate medical attention when he was 
arrested tuesday 
we would have liked to have more people come out but we feel 
that we touched the hearts of christians said operation rescue 
spokesman bob nolte it was a pioneer effort and from that 
aspect were pleased 
the movement ran low on people willing to go to jail but more 
arrived in atlanta late in the week for saturdays protest 
demonstration leaders claimed success through the week saying 
at least some of the women with appointments at the four clinics 
they picketed were persuaded to change their minds 
but a spokeswoman for the national abortion rights league 
characterized the demonstrators as religious extremists who want 
to impose their religious moral views on this entire country 
i think what they achieved is further alienating the 
american public the public abhors extremist tactics of 
intimidation said kate michelman executive director of the 
league who was in atlanta at the start of the week she made her 
remarks in seattle 
about 70 volunteers were on duty saturday to take women through 
the picket lines into the clinic 
police reminded demonstrators that they were violating an 
injunction when they tried to persuade one woman not to enter the 
clinic for an abortion 
the injunction prohibits among other things the bothering or 
harassing of people entering or leaving the clinics 
estimates varied about how many women were dissuaded from having 
abortions during the week 
ignatius deblasi administrator of the midtown clinic where 
there were 53 arrests friday and 40 on saturday said about 80 
percent of those with clinic appointments friday kept them 
operation rescue claims many of the women entering the clinic 
were plants sent in to give the impression of normal operation 
demonstrators picketed the atlanta pretrial detention center 
later saturday to protest what they said was an intentional delay 
in releasing protesters who posted bond about 390 of those 
arrested during the week remained in custody saturday afternoon 
but city officials who warned earlier that those arrested would 
be treated like other prisoners said it would take days to process 
the demonstrators out because their paperwork is not being 
processed separately from other prisoners 
operation rescue founder randall terry said they were coming 
to paralyze the city government said jd hudson atlantas 
corrections director theyve lived up to their purpose to 
overwhelm the criminal justice system 
they tore up the tracks now theyre complaining because the 
train wont roll

democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis is trying in advance to take the steam out of what he says 
are planned national rifle association radio commercials in north 
carolina distorting his position on gun control 
its another outrageous distortion of what i believe 
dukakis said ive always supported the right of hunters and 
sportsmen to have weapons and use them and people to defend 
themselves in their homes subject to state law 
he added what im concerned about is teenagers with ak47s 
and uzis that are driving around cities in this country killing 
people and copkiller bullets and undetectable plastic guns which 
are threatening the safety of people 
dukakis discussed the guncontrol issue in an interview friday 
after delivering a campaign speech in this mountain city 
his state campaign spokeswoman amy dehart said dukakis wanted 
an opportunity to clarify his stand on gun control before monday 
when ms dehart said the nra ads would begin running 
theyve made a major buy of air time for these ads total 
distortions of the governors position ms dehart said 
the nra also has sent letters to its north carolina members 
criticizing dukakis as a guncontrol advocate she said 
david w conover a federal liaison with the washingtonbased 
nra declined to discuss the organizations advertising strategy 
and said he did not know whether the group would run antidukakis 
commercials in north carolina 
but conover said the nra was spreading the word nationwide that 
dukakis had favored restrictions on gun ownership in massachusetts 
throughout his political career governor dukakis has been 
openly hostile to private firearms ownership conover said in a 
telephone interview 
he said dukakis supported a 1976 proposal to ban private 
ownership of pistols and revolvers in massachusetts the measure 
failed in a statewide referendum he said 
conover said dukakis had modified his stand since entering the 
presidential race but that the nra still feared he would support 
gun control as president 
dukakis in the interview said if somebody runs these 
commercials then obviously i am going to fight back and im 
not only going to fight back to clear up the the record im going 
to make sure that people in this country really understand how bad 
george bushs record has been on crime and drugs 
ms dehart said she had seen scripts of the ads including one 
featuring actor charlton heston criticizing dukakis on gun control 
and a massachusetts prison furlough program

the incident occurred after dark friday when police dispersed a 
crowd of several hundred youths who left the rally and tried to 
stage a demonstration near the national palace 
a delegation of foreign journalists delivered a protest to the 
national police on saturday it said police attacks on more than 20 
journalists in the demonstrations were unprovoked 
after meeting the delegation police col ivan gonzalez said 
there have been isolated cases of police attacks on reporters 
but that type of behavior does not reflect national police 
policy 
orders have been issued again this morning that incidents like 
that are not to happen again gonzalez said 
opposition leaders are pressing pinochet to modify the 1980 
constitution that set up wednesdays referendum and that allows 
pinochet to remain in power through march 1990 despite his defeat 
presidential and congressional elections now are scheduled for 
december 1989 opposition leaders and many chileans want them held

a real estate salesman tired of 
midwestbashing wants to give a recently introduced beverly hills 
high school fashion line a run for its money with his own peoria 
high school getups 
fred wolfermans idea for the peoria clothing came from his 
impression that residents of this illinois river city of 120000 
and the entire midwest get no respect from people living on the 
east coast or in california 
ive traveled to both coasts and the perspective seems to be 
that theres nothing between new york and los angeles said 
wolferman who lives in kansas city mo its like the midwest 
doesnt exist it really frustrates me 
the peoria school board last week sold him the rights to peoria 
highs logo 
peoria is a true heartland city he said its name has all 
the right connotations i want to make it a competition and see 
which is more popular the heartland or the west coast if we 
position it that way the heartland is going to win 
wolferman said the idea came to him when he read a newspaper 
article about the beverly hills fashion line in which shannon 
richey of the san diegobased lucas enterprises inc said people 
are looking for something that has a lifestyle attached to it this 
is the closest most kids in peoria will ever feel theyre part of 
the beverly hills high school attitude

the armed forces dismissed a general and 
four other officers for allowing cocaine worth 10 million to be 
smuggled out of bolivia the military high command said saturday 
the dishonorable discharges came one day after officials 
announced the discovery and destruction of a jungle cocaine 
laboratory that produced tens of millions of dollars of drugs 
former gen gustavo arrazola and the four officers were accused 
of protecting a clandestine airstrip in the chapare coca leaf 
producing region the high command said nearly four tons of cocaine 
paste worth at least 10 million were smuggled out of the 
airstrip

most us companies are ignoring president 
reagans order to pay taxes owed panama into a treasury department 
escrow account established to pressure strongman manuel noriega to 
resign us officials say 
reagan last april ordered us companies with offices in panama 
to withhold taxes they owe its government and instead pay them into 
the us escrow account the idea was that the money would be 
turned over to panama once noriega has resigned or been forced from 
office 
six months later that treasury department account remains 
nearly empty as us companies routinely ignore the order to pay 
into it according to a member of the house foreign affairs 
committee 
rep sam gejdenson dconn said senior state department 
officials told him they estimate that the escrow account is 65 
million short of what it should be at this point 
gejdenson gave no figures on how much money is in the account 
but other congressional sources who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity said it contained only 39 million a figure that one 
administration official described as in the ballpark 
some us businesses have told the administration they did not 
want to pay into the account out of fears there were insufficient 
accounting controls to keep track of how much each company paid 
said peter secor a panamanian specialist at the state department 
secor said the treasury department not the state department 
keeps records on who pays and how much gejdenson said treasury 
department officials have refused his repeated requests for that 
information 
reagans order was in two parts the first that us companies 
do not pay the noriega government and second that the money be 
placed in the treasury department fund 
regardless of the second part most if not all are complying 
with the first secord said adding that the administration had 
put the most priority on keeping the money out of the noriega 
regimes hands 
that explanation has been greeted with skepticism on capitol 
hill partly because the panamanian government is allowing us 
companies to continue operating there 
i wouldnt be surprised if the companies continue to pay 
taxes to panama said kathleen m bertelsen a gejdenson foreign 
policy adviser i just doubt noriega lets them stay there without 
paying 
but secor said noriega simply cannot afford politically or 
economically to throw american corporations out 
they dont want business confidence to erode anymore he 
said its important for the noriega government to create the 
impression of normalcy 
secor also rejected the notion that noriega is not applying 
pressure on the american firms saying that panamanian officials 
have used legal financial and physical threats to try to get the 
tax money 
us businessmen have reported threats such as youre going 
to be in trouble or even youre family is going to be in trouble 
if you dont pay youre companys taxes secor said 
gejdenson in an interview friday said administration officials 
have refused repeated invitations to testify at subcommittee 
hearings to discuss the escrow account because the revelations 
would be an embarrassment to vice president george bush and his 
presidential campaign 
its one more demonstration that theyve blown it the 
democratic lawmaker said

michael dukakis and his 85yearold 
mother lashed back at george bush on saturday angrily responding 
to bushs barrage of attacks on dukakis crime record and citing 
their familys own suffering from violent crime 
it was a moment of rare public emotion by dukakis who spoke of 
the beating and robbery of his father at age 77 and the killing of 
his brother stelian by a hitandrun driver at the age of 43 
it was made even more so by the presence of the candidates 
mother euterpe who offered her own impassioned defense of her son 
she accused bush of mangling the truth of trying to divide us 
of suggesting that as the son of immigrants dukakis does not love 
the flag quite as much and of being behind letters sent to 
residents of a massachusetts town saying her brothers were 
communists 
can anyone get this low dukakis mother said 
campaigning on the bates college campus where his mother and 
father attended school the democratic presidential nominee 
responded forcefully to bushs charges escalated a day earlier 
that dukakis had shown insensitivity to the victims of crime he 
said bush was trying to divert attention from his own pathetic 
record in the reagan administration on drugs and crime 
bush has hammered the massachussetts governor repeatedly over a 
case in which convicted murderer willie horton attacked a maryland 
couple after failing to return from a furlough from a massachusetts 
prison one of the victims of that crime have campaigned on bushs 
behalf 
dukakis also renewed his criticism of bushs running mate dan 
quayle saying bush has been running away from his choice for 
vice president since the vice presidential debate last wednesday 
which polls and pundits judged quayle to have lost 
remember what he said dukakis said recalling bushs 
comments before he selected quayle as his running mate he said 
watch my vice presidential decision that will tell all 
it sure does dukakis added george you can try and run 
from that decision but you cant hide it and you cant run away 
from your own record of failure by exploiting a human tragedy for 
your own political ends 
dukakis in responding to the horton case cited examples of 
similar acts of violence committed by inmates freed from the 
federal prison system from the california prison system when 
ronald reagan was governor and from a houston halfway house that 
bush has supported and praised 
i dont need any lectures from mr bush on crimefighting or 
on the sensitivity of compassion we must extend to the victims of 
crime said dukakis 
unlike mr bush ive been a chief executive on the front 
lines of fighting crime dukakis said unlike mr bush who 
will not take responsibility for anything i as chief executive 
took full responsibility for that tragic horton case and acted to 
change that policy and mr bush knows it 
he said that under reagan in california a police officer and 
school teacher were murdered by inmates on furlough he added 
unlike mr bush governor reagan took full responsibility 
he said thousands of drug dealers are furloughed from federal 
prisons every year and that he is seeking extradition of a 
convicted bank robber who was paroled from federal prison and is 
wanted to stand trial in the murder of a boston police officer 
in the houston case he said one inmate raped and murdered a 
ministers wife after leaving the halfway house he said bush 
even presented that halfway house with a presidential award 
after the tragedy occurred 
so why are we being treated these last few days to a fresh 
assault on the horton case by mr bush dukakis said i think 
we know why because of his own pathetic record in the fight 
against crime and drugs 
dukakis and his mother spoke to a crowd of several thousand 
people inside a gym at bates college the crowd at the school of 
1500 students was swelled by the colleges annual parents day 
the college was where his mother who came to the united states 
from greece at age 9 graduated with honors in 1925 dukakis 
father panos attended the school for one year in 1919 before 
transferring to harvard medical school 
euterpe dukakis offering her defense against bushs charges 
said her son is fighting a very very difficult enemy opponent 
unfortunately this opponent tries everything possible so far we 
have not answered very much 
her husband died in 1979 six years after the attack on him

and it gave me a slight headache said hazel reed of bakersfield 
who was vacationing in palm springs 
when my chest started hurting thats when i decided to leave 
my home said donna winters who said her daughter also had chest 
pains

her home because she was afraid to venture out on foot 
i stayed because i have no car i put towels on the floor in

said eventually she called a friend to drive her to the evacuation

michael dukakis temper rising as he recalled violence against 
his own family accused george bush on saturday of shameless 
use of crime victims to win votes bush touted a police endorsement 
but found himself sidetracked to another issue denying he was 
running away from his running mate 
bush defended dan quayle his choice for vice president and 
said he was tired of erroneous reporting that he was trying to 
distance himself from the indiana senator 
quayle was the only one of the top four candidates off the 
campaign trail saturday and lloyd bentsen still basking in the 
glow of his apparent debate victory over quayle last wednesday 
said im beginning to wonder where is dan quayle did he leave a 
forwarding address when he left omaha 
democrat dukakis who had kept quiet in recent weeks as 
republican bush struck again and again at what he said was the 
massachusetts governors revolvingdoor policy on weekend 
furloughs for dangerous criminals lashed back on saturday 
bush was exploiting a human tragedy for political ends 
dukakis said in a speech that aides said he wrote by hand the 
previous night after being told of the bush campaigns latest 
efforts to win votes using the case of willie horton 
horton a convicted murderer failed to return from a 
massachusetts furlough in 1986 and in early 1987 attacked a 
maryland couple after breaking into their house bush accusing 
dukakis of astounding insensitivity toward crime victims 
described the attack at length on friday and one of the victims 
cliff barnes flew to california to give campaign speeches and make 
radio ads for bush 
dukakis citing crimes against his father and brother told his 
audience saturday at bates college in lewiston maine i dont 
need any lectures from mr bush on crime fighting or on the 
sensitivity or compassion we must extend to the victims of crime 
unlike mr bush ive been a chief executive on the front 
lines of fighting crime unlike mr bush who will not take 
responsibility for anything i as chief executive took full 
responsibility for that tragic horton case and acted to change that 
policy and mr bush knows it 
so lets look at the facts and stop this shameless playing of 
politics with the tragedy of a crime 
dukakis said his father was beaten robbed and left bound at age 
77 and that his brother stelian was killed by a hitandrun driver 
the democrat also said that when ronald reagan was governor of 
california a police officer and school teacher were murdered by 
inmates on furlough and he said that under the reagan 
administration the federal prison system has granted thousands 
of furloughs to drug pushers and drug traffickers 
dukakis also cited bushs role in supporting a halfway house in 
houston where one of the inmates left the house and raped and 
murdered a ministers wife 
he was joined by his 85yearold mother euterpe who offered 
her own impassioned comments she accused bush of mangling the 
truth of trying to divide us of suggesting that as the son of 
immigrants dukakis does not love the flag quite as much and of 
being behind letters sent to residents of a massachusetts town 
saying her brothers were communists 
can anyone get this low she asked 
earlier saturday in washington bush kept his own focus on the 
lawandorder issue accepting the endorsement of the head of the 
national fraternal order of police 
he made no mention of quayle during the event 
afterward bush was turning to leave but then came back to say 
heatedly that he was getting a little tired of erroneous 
reporting that has noted his relative lack of comment on quayle 
since the debate in omaha neb 
this concept that i see in some of these reports that i am not 
supportive of dan quayle are absolutely ludicrous he said 
they are ridiculous he did well in that debate he has my full 
support and i made a good decision in selecting the indiana 
senator as running mate 
the police organizations president dewey stokes said earlier 
that he was endorsing bush whom he called the law enforcement 
candidate 
a news release from the bush campaign touted the 197000person 
membership of the organization but stokes acknowledged he was 
giving only his personal support not that of the group which has 
not taken a position 
bushs campaign speeches have been emphasizing his stance that 
dukakis is soft on crime a point the vice president has tried to 
underscore with several public endorsements by law enforcement 
officials dukakis has responded with similar endorsements from 
other police groups 
in houston on saturday bentsen was trying to keep the focus on 
quayle 
they have chosen a candidate that the imagemakers and the poll 
takers thought could be packaged and sold to the american people 
thats supposed to be the very latest the most productive of 
tactics by these imagemakers and it just didnt wash the american 
people are not buying it you have to have more substance there 
than that 
noting president reagans defense of quayle on friday bentsen 
said i think the best review i received on the debate was from 
the oval office itself when they brought out the great 
communicator to try to bring about some kind of damage control

democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen promised saturday to make george bush face the 
music for choosing dan quayle for the republican ticket 
bentsen contending his debate with the indiana senator 
wednesday night was the turning point for the democrats said 
at a houston news conference that the republicans have now tried 
to turn the subject away from the debate to not talk about dan 
quayle 
in fact im beginning to wonder where is dan quayle did he 
leave a forwarding address when he left omaha asked sen 
bentsen who was wrapping up a threeday swing through his home 
state on saturday 
later in the day making a quick trip to the navajo nation in 
neighboring new mexico bentsen continued to brag about his debate 
performance 
dan quayle has a different perspective than he had last 
wednesday night he said 
bentsen with sen jeff bingaman dnm stood waving on the 
tailgate of a secret service van as he rode into shiprock along a 
two and onehalf mile parade route for the towns 65th annual fair 
tens of thousands of people were there for the parade and some ran 
up to grab bentsens hand when they found out who he was 
he watched an indian dance demonstration and met with tribal 
leaders he told the crowd that the democrats stood for more and 
better rural health education and development programs and that 
the republicans had cut such programs back 
the democrats are hoping a strong vote from the reservations 
will help them win new mexico in november 
from new mexico bentsen was returning to texas to end his trip 
with a pair of appearances in el paso on the far western end of 
the state 
george bush may try to run away from his running mate but he 
really cant hide bentsen said at his houston news conference 
while the republicans are running from the issues and running 
from dan quayle we dont intend to let them change the tune were 
going to see that they face the music bentsen said 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis has been facing 
the music in texas on the issues of crime and gun control in a 
barrage of republican ads portraying him as a coddler of criminals 
who wants to disarm honest citizens bentsen attacked what he said 
were distortions of dukakis record and said texas would see 
through them 
texans wont buy a bill of goods on gun control from a man who 
wanted to sell hawk missiles to the ayatollah he said 
bentsen denied republican assertions that the democrats had 
given up on winning the south 
that is obviously not true it sounds like some of his 
comments during the debate not true at all he said 
i was in north carolina the other day and they tell me were 
ahead there i was in tennessee they said thats a dead heat i 
think were ahead in arkansas weve seen a nice improvement here 
in texas where the momentum is back in our direction he said 
citing a recent poll showing the ticket only five points behind 
bentsen also discussed his relationship with the late president 
john f kennedy which some have questioned since bentsen said that 
they were friends he said that during the debate just before 
telling quayle he was no jack kennedy 
bentsen who served in the house with kennedy said he was the 
massachusetts senators finance chairman in houston when kennedy 
ran for president he also said he received from kennedy an 
inscribed copy of his pulitzer prizewinning book profiles in 
courage 
kennedy invited him to his wedding bentsen said but he was 
already scheduled to make a speech in south texas and missed it 
if i had known he was going to be president id have gone 
he said

wendy lee coffields strangled body was found 
dumped in the green river south of seattle in 1982 this year the 
scattered remains of peri suzette farmer were found in rural san 
diego county 
some 1700 miles and six years separates the slayings but task 
forces in washington and california are trying to determine whether 
an elusive murderers path can be traced between them a path 
marked by up to 56 other deaths and disappearances 
coffield 16 was the first victim linked to the socalled green 
river serial killer who is officially blamed for the murders of 40 
women in washington and oregon 
on sept 27 a san diego county sheriffs department 
spokesperson said the department had identified farmer 22 and 
that her death was being investigated by a 10member task force 
formed to investigate the killings and any possible link to the 
green river case 
police blame the disappearances of eight others in washington 
and oregon on the same killer who preyed mostly on prostitutes and 
transients until the slayings appeared to end in march 1984 
the san diego task force is looking into the deaths of women 
dating back to june 1985 whose bodies were dumped throughout the 
county and whose murders seem to fit the pattern of the green river 
killings 
lt bill baxter head of the san diego sheriffs department 
homicide unit has said up to a dozen cases may be related 
its a possibility baxter said this summer i wouldnt 
say its remote but it hasnt risen to a conclusive statement that 
theres a linkage 
the lead detectives in this case believe the green river 
killer is responsible for some of the killings in san diego a 
green river task force detective told the san diego union newspaper 
in august 
san diego sheriffs spokeswoman sgt liz foster said two men 
arrested in connection with attacks on prostitutes are being 
investigated 
no one contacted saturday at either the sheriffs office or the 
police department knew about the status of the investigation 
similarities exist among the cases 
most victims were strangled had backgrounds in prostitution or 
drug use and were transients 
most of the seattle victims were found near an area called 
pacific highway south which is dotted with motels and bars popular 
with prostitutes most of the san diego victims were found near or 
along el cajon boulevard an area much like the seattle strip 
in seattle the killer dumped a number of his victims in wooded 
areas 30 to 40 miles from the city in san diego many of the 
bodies were left on secondary roads within 75 miles of the city 
the green river series appears to have ended in 1984 after 
police began heavy enforcement efforts against men patronizing 
prostitutes the san diego series began in 1985 
selfdescribed streetwalkers on el cajon boulevard say they are 
aware of the killings 
the police let us know how many girls are missing or if one is 
found said one woman who identified herself as christy 18 
from washington dc 
she said the police also have warned prostitutes to be careful 
of whom they solicit for business the fears there she added 
in seattle it wasnt until two years after coffields body was 
found and many killings later that a task force was formed 
king county police capt bob evans head of the green river task 
force believes a more concerted effort in the beginning could have 
ended the seattle spree 
if we knew back in 8283 what we know now then all of these 
killings wouldnt have happened he said

mexico says an opec price war is crowding it 
out of its no 1 market the united states 
beginning this month opec governments have offered extra price 
concessions to customers and moved to undercut noncartel 
competitors including mexico the government oil monopoly pemex 
said friday 
coupled with overproduction the concessions have initiated an 
undeclared intense competition in prices among countries in the 
persian gulf that decided to maintain or increase their market 
participation searching for new clients and seeking to displace 
established commercial flows pemex said in a statement 
pemex on friday announced price reductions for the united states 
and said saudi arabia had displaced mexico canada and venezuela as 
the united states no 1 oil supplier 
it said production by the 13member organization of petroleum 
exporting countries surpassed 20 billion barrels per day in august 
and september and blamed aggressive competition between opec 
members for forcing the average price of mexican crude on spot 
markets to about 9 a barrel 
the monopoly said as a result of the changing marketplace for 
crude that it will earn less this year than the 79 billion 
generated by oil exports in 1987 
but pemex said friday that it will not increase its exports to 
compensate for lost earnings and risk aggravating an already 
volatile market 
mexico is ready to hold a dialogue both with opec members as 
well as independent exporters with the objective of achieving 
reasonable and stable prices for petroleum the statement said 
the excelsior news service on thursday quoted an official with 
the energy mines and stateowned industries department as saying 
mexico had lost 2 billion in anticipated revenues so far in 1988 
because of depressed market prices the department oversees pemexs 
operations 
foreign exchange revenues generated by oil exports are essential 
to mexicos efforts to service its 104 billion foreign debt 
second largest in the developing world behind brazil 
mexico is the worlds sixthlargest oil producer

pope john paul ii on saturday urged 
europe to build a future based on the foundation of dignity 
freedom and rights that transcend national boundaries 
john paul making his fourth trip to france and his 40th foreign 
trip as pope spoke to the council of europe and the european court 
of human rights on the first day of his fourday visit to 
alsacelorraine in eastern france 
in an airport arrival statement the pontiff speaking in 
french said the roman catholic church views with satisfaction 
the efforts made by the european countries to tighten still more 
their bonds and forge a common future 
in the past the polishborn pontiff has evoked the vision of a 
united europe from the atlantic to the urals based on a common 
christian heritage 
the pope expanded on this theme later saturday and was expected 
to do so again when he speaks to the european parliament on tuesday 
his message comes at a time of lively debate among the common 
market nations which have agreed to fully integrate their 
economies in 1992 the commitment has touched off widespread 
discussion about whether western europe should become a single 
political unit 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain provoked protests 
last month when she declared a usstyle european union would be 
highly damaging to the individual states 
speaking to the council of europe the pope said the countries 
of the old continent should remember their common christian 
heritage and apply it in policies governing family life 
biotechnology education and employment 
the most urgent problem on which all nations should cooperate 
is access to work he said 
is it utopian to ask that when decisions of an economic nature 
are made there should be consideration of the trials of those who 
lose through unemployment a part of their dignity and sometimes 
even their strength to hope 
mrs thatcher has called on her fellow leaders to concentrate on 
lowering commercial barriers and other practical steps setting 
aside projects for europewide social progress she described in a 
recent speech as utopian 
in a woodpaneled room of the palace of europe the 68yearold 
pope said that if europe wishes to be true to itself it must 
gather together all the forces of the continent respecting the 
character of each region but finding its roots in a common 
spirit 
in the more intimate chamber at the european court of human 
rights the pope referred to human rights as not just a catalogue 
of positive rights but a body of underlying values that are 
the expression of the inalienable dignity of the human person 
in the late afternoon john paul said mass at strasbourg 
cathedral arriving in the open popemobile despite the cool weather 
and periodic drizzle in the evening the pope spoke in french and 
german to a rally of 36000 youngsters at the la meinau stadium in 
a strasbourg suburb he spoke of understanding some of the issues 
facing youth today including unemployment sex and education 
i respect your suffering i am open to the questions it brings 
you up against no doubt there are even greater more 
widespread evils the poor countries would tell you so he said 
the popes visit was timed for his participation in the 2000th 
anniversary of strasbourg he also has scheduled visits to the 
dioceses of strasbourg metz and nancy all in the northeast near 
west germany 
the council of europe is composed of 21 parliamentary 
democracies that make up nearly all of noncommunist europe it 
aims to coordinate european legislation through a series of accords 
and to encourage unity democracy and human rights 
the court of human rights has unusual power for an international 
judicial body with the right to assign damages to the losing party 
in a case or to expel a country from the council of europe 
it has condemned britain for its methods of interrogating 
terrorism subjects in northern ireland and ruled in favor of two 
sets of british parents in a case that resulted in the abolition of 
corporal punishment in english state schools 
unlike the european parliament the council of europe and its 
judicial organs are not related to the european economic community 
or common market

columbia university snapped college footballs 
longest losing streak of 44 games over nearly five years on 
saturday by defeating ivy league rival princeton 1613 
solomon johnsons 2yard scoring run with about five minutes 
left to play capped a 53yard drive and followed a field goal that 
had given princeton a 139 lead 
columbias greg abbruzzese rushed for 182 yards as the lions won 
for the first time in 47 games the last time the lions won was a 
2118 defeat of yale on oct 15 1983 since that game columbia 
had averted defeat only by tying bucknell and dartmouth later in 
1983 
columbia fans tore down both goal posts smeared themselves with 
mud and exulted in the cold and damp 
wonderful said lenny rehner clutching his wet thermal 
mittens its wonderful weve been waiting a long time 
im feeling a little faint agreed charles fornara a 1986 
graduate who had never seen his team win 
the anarchic columbia marching band joined the pileup on the 
field complete with sousaphone trumpets flutes and drums band 
members massed outside the stadium later chanting against 
princeton and dangling from the open jaws of columbias bronze lion 
statue 
the victory came on columbias homecoming day when stars of 
columbias nationally ranked teams of the late 1940s were present 
to watch 
theyve got the monkey off their backs now said joe karas 
a 1949 graduate who played guard 
its like youre thirsty for a long time and all of a sudden 
you get something to drink weve been out in the desert said 
don kasprzak a 1947 graduate who played quarterback 
john sharkey a senior tackle on this years team said he 
watched in disbelief from the sidelines as princetons lastsecond 
49yard field goal attempt fell short and wide 
its hard to believe that we actually achieved what we set out 
to do sharkey said this almost makes up for all the rough 
times

brandeis university opened its doors 40 
years ago this month with 107 students and despite its tender age 
the private fouryear college today has 3000 students who appear 
to believe youth is an asset 
we have a lot more freedom in terms of policies because it 
doesnt have a long tradition its locked into said senior joel 
pomerantz 20 of denver who is student senate president 
its youth gives it an air of progressiveness people recognize 
its a place to really explore what you believe in said 
pomerantz 
the jewish founders of brandeis wanted to create a nonsectarian 
school in the tradition of such universities as harvard and notre 
dame whose origins were religious but whose mission was quality 
education 
it was established at a time when some universities limited 
enrollment of jews and other minorities 
in 1948 a lot of top universities still had quota systems for 
jews and catholics and blacks were hardly an issue then said 
david merkowitz spokesman for the washingtonbased american 
council on education 
you dont have the same kinds of needs for unbiased 
admission merkowitz said but the availability of institutions 
like that is important in educational diversity 
today the student body is estimated to be about 65 percent 
jewish thirteen percent are black hispanic and asian 
a place of excellence thats why brandeis was founded there 
were quotas against jews but there was a need beyond that said 
brandeis president evelyn handler 
brandeis was a maverick from the start only two of its seven 
founding trustees had been to college the school lacked a single 
large endowment but instead built itself on many small donations 
the university is among the most expensive private colleges at 
20000 for tuition room and board 
the school was named for the late us supreme court justice 
louis d brandeis a liberal jurist and the first jew on the high 
court when he was appointed in 1916 he died in 1941 
the small liberal arts university on the grounds of a defunct 
medical school 10 miles west of boston soon attracted to its 
faculty such luminaries as leonard bernstein and eleanor roosevelt 
it began turning out such graduates as the future rep stephen 
solarz dny angela davis and marshal herskovitz the producer of 
the awardwinning tv show thirtysomething 
there was a cerain audacity to the whole thing said 
professor lawrence fuchs who teaches american civilization and 
politics and has been at brandeis since 1952 serving in a variety 
of administrative posts 
it had such phenomenal mercurial success no institution 
assembled a faculty of national and international standing so 
quickly fuchs said 
the question of brandeis jewish identity remains an unsettled 
one however 
when a student newspaper three years ago praised the palestine 
liberation organization and criticized israel other students 
stormed its offices and labeled its staff onethird jewish 
antisemitic 
just this past april jewish students who observe religious 
dietary laws protested when the student cafeteria began serving 
pork and shellfish 
a counterprotest by students accused the protesters of hostility 
toward nonjews on the campus

emperor hirohito was given another blood 
transfusion saturday as his son crown prince akihito expressed 
concern over the number of events canceled out of respect for the 
ill monarch 
for the second day hirohito showed no outward signs of the 
hemorrhaging that caused him to vomit blood 20 days ago imperial 
officials said but doctors said the 87yearold emperor received 
another transfusion because they believe the bleeding has not 
stopped 
hirohito the worlds oldest living monarch now has received a 
total of 13 pints of blood since his condition worsened 
imperial household agency spokesman kenji maeda quoted doctors 
as saying a new antibiotic apparently has helped reduce the 
emperors slight fever which they believe is caused by an 
inflammation of his bile duct 
maeda said the emperors condition was stable and his jaundice 
had not progressed rapidly 
news reports have said hirohito has cancer but palace officials 
have neither confirmed nor denied the reports 
in separate meetings with imperial household agency grand 
steward shoichi fujimori and prime minister noboru takeshita 
akihito heir to the throne said his father would be displeased 
about the scores of events being canceled in deference to his 
illness officials said 
we appreciate the peoples warm consideration very much but 
if it affects their daily lives im afraid it would not make the 
emperor happy akihito was quoted as telling fujimori 
events including sports festivals concerts overseas trips by 
government officials and visits by foreign dignitaries have been 
canceled since the emperor fell ill 
the emperor was considered a living god until he renounced his 
divinity after world war ii under japans postwar constitution he 
became a symbol of the state with no real political power

the space shuttle discovery arrived 
home atop a jumbo jet saturday five days after completing 
americas first manned space mission since the challenger tragedy 
a boeing 747 with the shuttle bolted on its back descended 
through a cloud deck and glided to a runway touchdown at 704 pm 
edt as darkness descended on the kennedy space center the return 
flight began saturday morning at edwards air force base calif 
because the kennedy runway is not heavily lighted and because of 
cloudy weather nasa officials were considering diverting the 
shuttle aircraft to eglin air force base in northwest florida for 
an overnight stay 
but half an hour before landing an advance plane reported 
conditions favorable and the jumbo jet came on in 
thousands of spectators turned out to applaud the return lining 
roads and river banks and creating huge traffic jams at the space 
center most of them were among the hundreds of thousands who were 
here to cheer discoverys departure on sept 29 
technicians planned to remove the shuttle from its carrier plane 
overnight and tomorrow and then tow it to a processing facility to 
prepare it for its next flight officials reported it returned from 
space in such good shape that little refurbishment work will be 
needed 
the shuttlejet combination made the threehour run after a 
refueling stop at kelly air force base in san antonio tex 
nasas modified boeing 747 took off from edwards air force base 
in californias mojave desert military base at 1054 am edt with 
the shuttle bolted to its back said nancy lovato spokeswoman for 
the national aeronautics and space administration 
it was a fitting finish to a super mission ms lovato said 
it was the prettiest takeoff from edwards that ive ever seen 
and ive seen them all it was as graceful as the landing 
the flight from edwards to san antonio was uneventful said joe 
algranti pilot of 747 
we had real good weather all the way with a little bit of 
tail wind he said we are glad to be back in business 
discovery and its fiveman crew landed on the hard clay rogers 
dry lake bed at edwards last monday four days after its launch 
from cape canaveral fla more than 400000 people came to cheer 
the returning astronauts 
it was the first shuttle flight since challenger blew up during 
liftoff on jan 28 1986 killing all seven crew members 
the highlight of discoverys flight was the successful 
deployment of a 100 million tracking and data relay communications 
satellite a twin of a satellite destroyed aboard challenger 
the next shuttle mission will be flown by atlantis which will 
carry a classified defense department payload when it is launched 
in late november 
discoverys next flight scheduled for feb 18 will deploy 
another tdrs satellite for nasa communications 
when discovery landed in california reporters asked richard 
truly nasas associate administrator for space flight if the 
shuttle and its jet carrier could take a more circuitous route to 
florida so it could be seen by more americans 
i wish we could fly it around but thats not its purpose 
truly replied its purpose is to get back to the cape and to get 
back into space where it belongs 
discovery was prepared for its return to florida by nasa 
technicians who photographed and replaced damaged heatshield 
tiles purged fuel from its main engines and orbital maneuvering 
engines installed a tailcone and locks to prevent control surfaces 
from fluttering during the flight then hoisted it atop the 747 
nasa bought the 225footlong jumbo jet from american airlines 
for 15 million in 1974 and at first used it for flight research 
projects boeing modified the jet for nasa in 1976 so it could 
carry the shuttles 
the 747 was reinforced and its engines were upgraded to increase 
takeoff thrust 
nasa recently purchased a second 747 to ferry shuttles 
crosscountry once it is modified the second jet will be based in 
el paso texas

a retired airline pilot was killed 
saturday when the vintage combat plane he was flying crashed 
minutes after making a pass before an air show crowd of 20000 
officials said 
no other injuries were reported 
authorities said max gardner of fort worth whose age was 
unavailable was killed when the twinengine douglass a20 havack 
attack bomber believed to be the last of its kind crashed about 
245 pm in a cornfield about five miles south of harlingen 
few people saw the crash because gardner had already flown past 
the crowd at the valley international airport and was about three 
miles away said herschel whittington of the confederate air force 
an international group of pilots and airshow buffs who owned the 
craft 
the havack attack bomber was a fairly small workhorse used by 
american australian and british forces during the early stages of

learning on the job once meant learning 
how to do the work but some kentucky companies are changing the 
rules to give themselves an edge and their employees an education 
there are about 400000 illiterate adults in kentucky and 
approximately 650000 adults without a high school diploma said 
pat gleich director of the kentucky literacy commission in 
frankfort 
some state employers have found that the lack of education among 
their workers is a drag on productivity 
we had a lot of people out there that didnt finish high 
school said earle johnson personnel administrator at the texas 
instruments plant in versailles youre demanding more from your 
people they couldnt cope with it they couldnt handle it 
texas instruments tested the 800 people at the plant two years 
ago johnson said and found 200 didnt have a high school 
education of those six could not read or write 
johnson arranged for an instructor to use a classroom in the 
plant to teach classes for general educational development diplomas 
the state paid for the instructor johnson said while the 
company provided some materials and the classroom students paid 
the 15 class fee at first classes were just for employees but 
now they are open to the public 
what weve found is we end up with a person who has a much 
higher selfesteem and they become a better employee because 
theyre willing to speak out better than they were before its 
done a lot for the confidence of the people 
its for the individual themselves basically but we get 
a benefit from it were not that holy i didnt think it would 
make a difference but it does it makes a big difference 
johnsons program was a model for a similar one at fuller 
precision manufacturing co in falmouth 
im excited to no end about jobsite education fuller 
president howard deem said during a recent interview 
with help from april roberts of the pendleton county adult 
education program and a literacy volunteer fuller offered ged and 
literacy classes at the plant this year 
of 158 employees about 30 signed up for both classes ms 
roberts said and 11 have so far received their geds 
deem said fuller paid for all materials class and test fees 
which totaled about 4000 he also said the employees who got 
their geds would receive a pay increase 
jerry spegal a high school dropout and assistant foreman at the 
plant said he would have taken the course without a bonus 
incentive 
i would say that when we first started going there was no 
talk of a bonus so i guess we all wouldve spegal said 
deem said the difference was phenomenal 
the return on the investment has been one of the best things 
ive ever done in my life he said we would have had to demote 
these people back to janitorial services because of the quality 
program were putting in how can we further the job 
education unless they can read and write and do some basic math 
even those who havent yet graduated are moving up so much in 
the plant theyre making money for us deem said 
spegal 29 said he is thinking about attending northern 
kentucky university 
im not really sure how far i want to go but ive got the 
rest of my life to do it

despite the antitax rhetoric of the 
presidential candidates the nations business leaders seem 
prepared to accept a tax increase as part of a plan to shrink the 
budget deficit 
republican george bush has flatly promised never to raise taxes 
while democrat michael dukakis has said he would turn to taxes only 
as a last resort 
but some of the executives of the countrys largest companies 
attending a meeting of the business council on saturday said they 
were willing to back off from their traditional opposition to tax 
increases 
in our private conversations i find in general people say 
id be willing to come up with some reasonable approach to 
additional taxes maybe dollar for dollar with real savings in 
deficit reduction said george m keller chairman of chevron 
corp 
the council finished its twiceayear twoday conference at 
this resort town in the mountains of western virginia by hearing 
from former transportation secretary drew lewis and former 
democratic national chairman robert s strauss 
the two are cochairmen of a highlevel government commission 
scheduled in december to deliver a deficitcutting plan to congress 
and the next president 
i think the business community is very concerned about the 
deficit i further think theyre satisfied there should be a 
spending cut andor a tax increase or some combination of both so 
long as it doesnt affect their business said lewis who as 
chairman of union pacific corp is also a member of the council 
he said his commissions job is 20 percent economics and 80 
percent trying to establish a willingness to share the 
misery 
council sessions are closed to nonmembers but executives and 
speakers talked with reporters afterward 
most of the business leaders prefer a tax increase if there is 
one aimed at curbing consumption and encouraging saving rather 
than a tax on business 
taxes that slow up the economy and reduce our ability to 
compete are bad for the longterm interests of the country said 
edmund t pratt jr chairman of pfizer corp a health care 
company 
john s reed chairman of citicorp the nations largest bank 
argued that a tax on consumption would benefit consumers 
if we do the right job with the fiscal deficit well get the 
payback in a relaxation on the monetary side so that you could see 
a significant reduction in interest rates he said 
a dissenting view was offered by walter wriston reeds 
predecessor at citicorp in the text of a speech to the council he 
argued that the deficit was inflated by outdated government 
accounting procedures that treat longrange capital spending the 
same as operating expenses and by the failure to take state 
government surpluses into account he said the us deficit was not 
severe compared with other western nations and had not caused the 
economic ills for which it is blamed 
although lewis stressed that the commission had made no 
decisions yet he said any tax increase likely would have to be 
coupled with an assurance that the money would be used to reduce 
the deficit he said any consumption tax would clearly have to have 
a provision to exempt poor people 
sen lawton chiles dfla chairman of the senate budget 
committee said the next president will have a difficult time 
convincing the public that it is necessary to reduce the deficit 
because neither presidential candidate is addressing the issue in 
the campaign 
the next president is going to need a lot of help 
business leaders have to be at the forefront of trying to help 
him he said 
rep william gray dpa chairman of the house budget committee 
and a member of the strausslewis commission was particularly 
critical of bush for boxing himself in politically with the notax 
pledge he also said bushs plan for a flexible spending freeze was 
fiscal frozen fruitcake

opposition plans to create a grand 
coalition government next year face a strong challenge from the 
left and from progovernment forces claiming a hidden victory in 
president augusto pinochets defeat 
its going to be very very hard arturo valenzuela 
director of latin american studies at georgetown university in 
washington said in an interview saturday 
the coalition must realize that next years open election is 
not in the bag said valenzuela a chilean who came home to 
monitor last weeks vote on pinochet 
he said the coalition of 16 opposition parties from the 
centerright to socialist left that campaigned for pinochets 
defeat must avoid overconfidence 
pinochet lost by more than 800000 votes in wednesdays 
yesorno referendum on whether to extend his 15year rule to 1997 
according to the 1980 constitution he remains president for 16 
more months the winner of elections planned for december 1989 is 
to assume power in march 1990 
the opposition coalitions secretarygeneral genaro arrigada 
said he is not worried that the opposition will fall apart despite 
the countrys tradition for splitting into what chileans call the 
three thirds right center and left most previous presidential 
elections had three major candidates one from each camp 
if we are going to have three thirds its not important if 
there is respect and understanding he said 
but he said the coalition plans to pursue a grand coalition 
government after pressing for constitutional changes to speed the 
election and pinochets departure from power 
theres a chore for each day he said right now what we 
have to do is change the constitution with the armed forces 
pinochet 72 who seized power in a 1973 coup has vowed to 
remain in office until his term runs out the powerful army he 
commands has shown no willingness to bargain with politicians 
patricio aylwin president of the centrist christian democratic 
party and ricardo lagos a prominent moderate socialist recognize 
that any negotiations with the military could take time 
the people are mature enough to understand that 15 years of 
dictatorship dont end in 15 hours lagos said if we remain 
united pinochet can do nothing thats the only important thing 
right now 
consensus will be relatively easy he said there arent 
that many leaders it seems to me we have to find a man or woman 
who represents everyone to run in the election 
most observers believe the consensus candidate will be aylwin a 
67yearold law professor and veteran politician generally 
considered acceptable to both the moderate right and left 
but leaders of the radical united left alliance on saturday 
called for pinochets immediate resignation and were expected to 
disregard moderates appeals for patience 
since wednesdays referendum lagos 52 has been barraged by 
supporters asking if he will run as the candidate of the left on 
friday he declared im not a candidate im not the most 
appropriate person 
the government and rightist groups are clearly hoping for an 
opposition split that could win them the election experts disagree 
over whether the constitution allows pinochet himself to be a 
candidate but his interior minister sergio fernandez said the 
loss wednesday actually represented a kind of political victory 
slightly more than 31 million people cast yes ballots 
wednesday compared to more than 38 million no votes 
fernandez said the no votes have to be divided by 16 
the number of parties in the opposition coalition while pinochet 
alone can claim the yes votes 
there is no greater political force than president pinochets 
support he said 
the oppositions support could be numerically more than the 
one the government received but it is not homogeneous fernandez 
said saturday night in a 12minute nationwide radioandtelevision 
broadcast we in the government are unified in all that is 
essential and it makes us stronger 
conservative civilian politicians also have expressed the desire 
to take the support for pinochet and turn it into a victory for the 
right in an open election 
if more than two candidates run and neither wins more than 50 
percent of the vote the constitution calls for a runoff between 
the two highest votegetters 
valenzuela said he was certain that if the opposition splits and 
the runoff features a rightist and a leftist candidate the right 
would win 
he said chileans would be afraid that a leftist government 
would lead to another coup and theyll choose anything before 
another coup

of aggravated firstdegree murder and other charges in the attack 
last year the same jury now will hear more testimony before 
deciding between a death sentence or life in prison without parole

hugged a supporter when the verdict was read 
the 15yearold girl who survived gunshots and a slashed 
throat also was in the courtroom for the verdict 
in closing arguments friday kitsap county prosecutor dan clem

ugly violent picture with that man at the core 
the isolated area where yates took the three had no houses no 
lights no traffic perfect place to rape and murder clem said 
yates raped the teens at gunpoint and tied them up and while 
binding them he had time to premeditate murder clem said the 
death penalty can be given only when murder is premeditated 
yates raped a girl tied her up then shot her in the eye and 
ear but she remained conscious and watched as yates sodomized a 
boy clem said after the assailant left she freed herself and ran 
barefoot down the gravel road to get help the prosecutor said 
who should she run into but the defendant clem said this 
nightmare shouldnt happen to anybody 
yates slit the girls throat in the second encounter but hes 
still not done clem said he strangles her smashes her face 
into the ground the girl played dead to make yates leave he 
said 
the defense maintained that yates attacked the children only 
after one of the girls consented to have sex with him and the 
three then threatened to doublecross him for money 
i am not denying to you daniel yates is not denying to you 
that he cut choked shot and strangled the teens defense 
attorney judith mandel told jurors but there are different 
versions of these events she added 
the three teens are from bremerton across puget sound from

legislation to provide better protection for 
government employees who report waste or fraud in their agencies 
won senate approval on saturday and was sent to president reagan 
under the bill approved earlier in the week by the house 
government whistle blowers who feel they have been unfairly treated 
would be allowed to appeal their cases directly to the merit 
systems protection board an independent body set up to review 
personnel actions 
supporters said the legislation was needed because the office of 
special counsel established to represent whistle blowers was not 
doing its job 
the bill also would make it easier for employees to prove 
improper retaliation by simplifying the elements of proof and 
increasing the burden on an agency to justify its actions 
the legislation will send a clear signal that retaliation 
against whistleblowers will not be tolerated in the federal 
government said sen carl levin dmich who sponsored the bill 
in the senate 
if we are going to achieve a more honest and efficient 
government it is essential that we restore confidence in federal 
employees that their government will respond in a fair and ethical 
manner whenever they disclose wrongdoing levin said in a 
statement 
the bill won senate approval on a voice vote as the chamber met 
past midnight early saturday working to complete action on 
numerous bills before congress adjourns for the national elections 
levin predicted reagan would sign the bill into law

a troubled reactor at the savannah river plant 
wont resume producing nuclear weapons material until engineers are 
sure longtime safety problems have been corrected an energy 
department spokesman said saturday 
i think we are all disturbed by what we have seen said john 
ahearne chairman of the advisory committee for nuclear facilities 
safety one of two energy department bodies investigating the 
sprawling facility near aiken sc 
richard w starostecki deputy assistant energy secretary for 
safety health and quality assurance also has started a new review 
of events at the savannah river plant said department spokeswoman 
chris sankey 
plant managers have been rocked over the past week by disclosure 
that up to 30 significant mishaps occurred at the facility over the 
past three decades and that many had not been reported to 
washington headquarters or disclosed to the public 
all three reactors at the plant have been shut down since august 
when a mishap idled the preactor 
spokesman doug elmets said the department will not restart the 
reactor until we are completely satisfied with all the safety 
procedures 
sankey said friday the department had set a nov 1 target date 
for restarting the preactor but elmets said saturday that sankey 
was in error and that no timetable has been set 
the plant produces two materials used in nuclear weapons 
plutonium which the government has in adequate supply and 
tritium which decays more quickly officials say the amount of 
tritium on hand and the date by which they must resume production 
are classified 
the new york times in its sunday editions said senior 
administration officials believe the savannah reactors may be out 
of service so long the united states might have to start 
deactivating nuclear warheads to recover radioactive elements for 
use in higher priority weapons 
it said the primary concern was the supply of tritium 
it is very important that we restore the reactors to safe 
operation soon said robert b barker the top pentagon official 
for atomic energy matters if we dont there will be very 
serious consequences for our ability to maintain our nuclear 
deterrent 
sankey also had said that if the savannah river plant cannot 
resume production in time the department might restart the 
nreactor at the hanford nuclear reservation in washington state in 
order to quarantee an adequate supply of tritium 
elmets however said it would take at least 18 months to 
restart the hanford reactor officials are not contemplating that 
option he said 
concern has been mounting within the government over procedures 
at the savannah river plant which is operated by ei du pont 
nemours amp co under contract from the energy department 
we have been trying to change the mindset sankey said 
we have been enhancing procedures as part of a longterm effort 
the preactor was closed after a mishap caused in part by a 
miscalculation of xenon and tritium levels and involving an 
unorthodox method to manipulate control rods according to an 
internal report released thursday 
no date has been set for restarting the other two reactors at 
savannah river which were shut down for longterm maintenance 
ahearne said his committee which was established as an 
independent board to advise energy secretary john herrington has 
noticed some changes in reporting procedures at savannah river but 
still has concerns 
from what we have seen it seems that there has grown up a 
sense of complacency at savannah river which is a dangerous 
attitude when dealing with nuclear reactors he said in a 
telephone interview 
the independent committee formed in march began reviewing 
operations at savannah river even before four senators this week 
urged an investigation said ahearne a former chairman of the 
nuclear regulatory commission 
so far what we have is a series of serious events he said 
we are not yet prepared to conclude whether these are individual 
things which need fixing or whether there is a pattern that means 
something more serious needs fixing 
the committee will discuss its preliminary findings at an open 
meeting wednesday and thursday in idaho falls idaho and is due to 
deliver a report to the energy secretary and congress on dec 1 
said ahearne 
another independent report prepared for the energy department 
by the nus corp a private consulting firm in aiken cited 558 
forced reactor shutdowns at savannah river from 1971 through 1987 
of which 51 percent were caused by equipment failure 26 percent by 
personnel failure 10 percent by degradation of essential 
services 10 percent by process difficulty and 3 percent by 
procedure deficiency 
the report also recorded seven offsite radioactive releases 
from 1975 through 1987 exceeding standards at the plant the most 
serious appeared to be the release of 600000 gallons of 
contaminated water on oct 25 1977 the most recent was a tank 
overflow in february 1987 in which tritium was released into the 
atmosphere

across the country a newspaper reported saturday 
sources close to the gao the primary investigative arm of 
congress told the houston post an investigation should be 
completed by january the newspaper did not identify the sources 
the newspaper also said a congressional committee would probably 
begin hearings on the matter after the report is completed

reports about reputed mob associates herman k beebe sr and mario 
renda and their connections to thrifts and to each other the post 
said 
beebe who is serving a oneyear prison sentence for bank fraud 
had connections to 12 failed texas savings and loans

lucchese crime families in new york 
renda who has been convicted of bank fraud in kansas city mo 
florida and new york brokered deposits into at least six of the 
failed texas thrifts beebe was connected to including mainland 
savings association the largest thrift in houston to fail 
beebe helped the owners of at least four of the failed thrifts 
to buy the institutions and did business with at least eight other 
failed savings and loans according to a 1985 us comptroller of 
the currency report on beebe lawsuits filed by the failed thrifts 
federal receiver and beebes associates 
officials with the justice department and the federal savings 
and loan insurance corp have alleged that beebe and renda used 
their connections to savings and loans to arrange loans for 
themselves and their associates the loans later went bad and 
contributed to the failures of the thrifts the paper said 
federal investigators are now trying to determine if those 
connections mean that beebe and renda were part of a larger 
consiracy by the mob to control and loot savings and loans across 
the country said officials with the justice department organized 
crime strike forces in texas and new york

they more than likely came from one of our atlantic fleet 
units said lt cmdr steve burnett a spokesman at fleet 
headquarters in norfolk va

the needles found thursday along a sixmile stretch of 
oceanfront from riviera beach to palm beach were still in their 
protective plastic sheaths no syringes were found 
burnett said other defense units had access to the needles from 
the lot so he could not be certain the navy was at fault 
the atlantic fleet rewrote its regulations in september after 
five garbage bags of medical waste traced to navy ships washed up 
on north carolina beaches in august burnett said with few

a group of hollywood celebrities sought to add 
star quality to the democratic presidential campaign of michael 
dukakis saturday as their star spangled caravan began a 
barnstorming tour of the pacific northwest 
any bit of enthusiasm on the campaign would be to all of our 
advantage said michael gross who portrays the affable father on 
televisions family ties 
about 35 actors appeared before about 800 students at the 
university of washington to campaign for the democratic ticket and 
to urge people to register to vote in novembers general election 
saturday was the last day to register in washington and about 
200 students signed up as democrats said chris crowley press 
secretary for the dukakis campaign in the state 
gross drew the loudest response when he commented on republican 
dan quyales vice presidential debate answer that he would first 
say a prayer if thrust into the presidency 
i can guarantee there would be a lot of other americans on 
their knees people who have never cast a prayer in their lives 
gross said 
the caravan organized by california assemblyman tom hayden 
husband of actress jane fonda also planned stops in portland 
ore and sacramento calif the three pacific coast states have 64 
votes in the electoral college nearly onequarter of those needed 
to elect a president hayden said 
the stakes in this election are very huge were at the end of 
the reagan era and the people in these states can pick the next 
president hayden said in los angeles before the group departed 
voter registration in a close race can make an election we hope 
by the caravan we will bring it to their attention 
for some on the tour which included bruce willis rob lowe 
morgan fairchild and justine bateman it was a new experience 
ive never been politically active before said john 
larroqette of the television show night court larroqette said 
he wrote in singersingwriter david bowie for president in the 1980 
election 
gross defined the group with a term republican candidate george 
bush has used to disparage dukakis 
as a group we are probably more liberal than the national 
average he said amidst an autographseeking crowd that followed 
the celebrities to voter registration tables at the campus rally 
lloyd bridges star of the 1960s television series sea hunt 
stressed environmental issues in supporting dukakis 
i like pure clean water to dive in he quipped the 
environment is very important but not enough is being done about 
it

electricity customers in chicago are paying the 
highest rates in the united states this fall a utility watchdog 
group said 
a citizens utility board study concluded electric rates charged 
by commonwealth edison co are increasing an average 62 percent as 
rates are converted from summer to winter scales this month 
edison serves chicago and much of northern illinois 
the increase approved by the illinois commerce commission in 
june means that a typical monthly residential bill will be 5858 
according to the study 
after chicago the next most expensive american cities for 
nonsummer electric rates were philadelphia with an average of 
5257 new york at 4966 san diego at 4539 and phoenix at 
4139 the study said 
an edison spokesman said the study results are misleading 
because a 13 percent reduction in summer rates is not considered 
the study figures were based on an estimate of 400 kilowatt 
hours per month by a singlefamily or twofamily building that does 
not have electric heat 
theyre not giving us credit for the rate reduction that was 
in effect during the hottest summer in history people paid 
substantially less than they would have if the old rates were in 
effect said edison spokesman john hogan 
the illinois commerce commission approved the 62 percent jump in 
winter rates as an emergency measure to reduce the difference 
between summer and winter bills
