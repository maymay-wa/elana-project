a park avenue doctor who legally dispenses 
cocaine as a pain reliever boasts a patient roster that includes 
sonny bono comedian david brenner and celebrity divorce lawyer 
marvin mitchelson according to a published report 
the daily news reported in its sunday editions that dr milton 
reder dispenses a form of cocaine for 25 a visit to patients 
complaining of pain from back problems arthritis and other 
conditions 
i couldnt walk 14 years ago this cured me brenner told the 
news brenner said he suffers from double scoliosis of the spine a 
herniated disk sciatica in both legs and a degenerative disease of 
the vertebrae 
reder 89 told the news that cocaine is the best local 
anesthetic there is his unusual treatment technically known as 
sphenopalatine ganglion block involves the application of a liquid 
cocaine solution inside a patients nose 
the treatment can render longterm relief from pain according to 
patients and some doctors familiar with the treatment but medical 
experts dont understand why the technique seems to works and some 
are skeptical said the news 
in theory its a very plausible technique we share the 
skepticism of many but we feel it is something worth looking into 
said dr david silverman a professor of anesthesiology at the yale 
school of medicine 
however the new york county medical society said the technique 
has no basis in scientific medicine 
the state health department last year investigated reder because 
of his large purchases of cocaine from pharmaceutical companies and 
directed him to stop using cocaine the news said 
continued use of the drug the department stated will be 
considered a violation of the controlled substances provision of the 
public health law 
reder agreed in writing to stop using cocaine in his treatments 
but several months later he again wrote to the department and said 
he planned to resume using the drug 
the director of the health departments bureau of controlled 
substances thomas coffey said officials will meet with the medical 
society to see if it has changed its view of reders treatment if 
not coffey told the news the department would purse legal action to 
stop reder

policy on business interests like the large familyowned 
communications company he heads a newspaper reported 
the new york times reported in sunday editions that gray had said 
in two interviews last week that he just learned on thursday about 
the policy which limits outside business income for white house

in november from his deputy john schmitz

counsel plans to continue as chairman of his family company summit 
communications inc but will give up the fee he collected during 
his eight previous years as vice presidential counsel

house prohibition from serving on corporate boards the times said 
he said that policy was under review and he would remain on the 
board of his family company according to the times 
gray told the times he complied with ethics rules by

schmitz blamed demands from the presidential campaign and the 
55page length of the report the newspaper said 
asked about a campaign pledge by bush in july that none of his 
aides would accept outside earned income gray said he was unaware 
of it because he was not involved in the campaign the times said 
the reagan white house had a similar policy although gray as a

one of the last to die in cambodias 
killing fields was michael scott deeds an american yachtsman 
tortured and executed in a grisly extermination center just as a 
vietnamese invasion force was ending the brutal rule of the khmer 
rouge 
ten years later michaels brother karl hopes to travel to the 
execution site in phnom penh and recover his remains 
i just dont want him to lie where he was tortured and killed 
he deserves a lot better than that deeds said in an interview 
he was a real good guy a great guy 
michael then 29 years old and another american christopher 
edward delance were seized by the khmer rouge while sailing off the 
cambodian coast in late 1978 according to captured records the two 
were taken to tuol sleng prison where they were interrogated and 
confessed to being cia agents 
they were executed sometime after they signed confessions jan 5 
1979 two days later vietnamese troops captured phnom penh and 
found unburied corpses and bloodstained torture instruments at tuol 
sleng 
deeds of seal beach calif tried to contact the cambodian 
government in 1980 and 1981 and also attempted to get un help in 
repatriating the remains of his brother but he was unsuccessful 
more recently he read news reports quoting cambodian ung pech 
among only four tuol sleng survivors that one or possibly two 
executed americans were buried in the tuol sleng compound rather 
than being dumped into mass graves in the phnom penh area 
this he said gave him hope the remains could be located and he 
made successful contact with vietnamese authorities deeds a 
communications and television production specialist is scheduled to 
fly to ho chi minh city in vietnam on tuesday and obtain a visa to 
cambodia 
deeds said he also has heard unconfirmed reports that a 
vietnamese doctor searching for his own brother in cambodia has 
uncovered the remains of some foreigners in a mass grave in phnom 
penh 
to help identification deeds is carrying michaels dental 
records and a cast of his teeth reconstructed by the family dentist 
michaels parents and two other brothers also live in california 
the phnom penh government says 20000 people died at tuol sleng 
including a small number of foreigners mostly captured offshore 
these included six americans three french nationals and two 
australians 
the onetime high school was converted to an interrogation and 
execution center during the khmer rouge era it is now a museum the 
walls of which are covered with thousands of photographs the khmer 
rouge took of their prisoners before killing them 
deeds said he was serving with the us navy in the philippines 
when news of his brothers death arrived from cambodia 
he took a leave and tried to reconstruct his brothers voyages in 
southeast asian waters aboard a 42foot sloop called the iwalani 
which michael originally had helped sail from hawaii 
he found that michael and his companion had sailed from singapore 
and were seized near the cambodian port of kompong som 
deeds says he doesnt know the full story of michaels activities 
in southeast asia but is skeptical that his brother worked for the 
cia a charge the khmer rouge commonly leveled against suspected 
enemies

israeli leaders faced with a changed political 
equation in the wake of plo chief yasser arafats more moderate 
stance have offered new peace plans that palestinians first 
rejected more than 10 years ago 
the reason for dressing up old ideas is that israel finds itself 
confronting not one but several dilemmas 
first israels army seems incapable of ending the palestinian 
uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip and the 
government does not want to concede the revolts goal an 
independent palestinian state 
second the rebellion along with arafats declaration that he 
recognizes israel and renounces terrorism has aroused sympathy from 
many abroad and is distancing israel from allies whose good will any 
small nation needs this is putting pressure on israel to come up 
with some sort of peace initiative 
third short of independence there seems to be very little new 
in the way of peace plans that have not already been raised and 
sunk since israel took control of the west bank and gaza strip in 
the 1967 sixday war 
the rogers plan of 1969 the begin plan of 1977 the camp david 
accords of 1978 the reagan plan of 1982 the shultz plan of 1988 
all have been rejected by one side the other or both 
david barilan an israeli political analyst outlined israels 
unenviable position at a conference of political scientists and 
former government officials here last week 
unless israel finds ways to quell the intefadeh it will 
be reduced to choosing between two evils maintaining the status quo 
and inviting political and diplomatic isolation or withdrawing to 
the 67 lines and allowing a palestinian state to rise on the 
outskirts of tel aviv and jerusalem he said 
against this background prime minister yitzhak shamir and 
defense minister yitzhak rabin both recently floated suggestions 
that center on granting autonomy or limited selfrule to the 17 
million palestinians in the occupied lands 
rabin called for election of local representatives then 
autonomy and finally negotiations for a final settlement of the 
status of the territories either in a confederation with jordan or 
with israel 
shamir for the first time directly said he would be willing to 
pull out israeli troops from some cities in the occupied lands if 
palestinians would accept autonomy the end result also would be 
talks about the final status of the west bank and gaza 
while elections and autonomy sound like fine ideas at first 
blush they are not new both were brought up in former israeli 
prime minister menachem begins peace plan of 1977 and the 
ussponsored camp david accords the following year the plan for 
troop withdrawals from palestinian cities also comes from camp david 
the palestinians were not party to the accords and rejected its 
suggestions for autonomy and elections for what they consider good 
reasons 
elections would be for palestinian representatives in the 
territories to negotiate with israel for a solution this cuts out 
the palestine liberation organization which most palestinians 
consider their best representative 
letting palestinians run local affairs while israel keeps control 
of security means settling for much less than the palestinians want 
their own country the word autonomy also has a bad taste for 
palestinians from the way begin introduced it 
he said that under autonomy the israeli army would remain 
stationed in the west bank and gaza we have a right and a demand 
for sovereignty over these areas of the land of israel this is our 
land and it belongs to the jewish nation rightfully begin said 
while shamir and rabin both said they revived such aged ideas in 
hopes of unsticking the peace process others say the moves really 
were intended to remove the tarnish that the uprising and arafats 
new diplomacy have put on israels public image 
yehuda litani middle east editor of the jerusalem post labeled 
the latest israeli efforts including meetings by rabin aides with 
local palestinian leaders shadowboxing and smoke screens 
the idea is to create the impression among the americans and 
perhaps also the west europeans that israel is genuinely interested 
in finding an interlocutor who can achieve agreements acceptable 
to the palestinian leadership abroad litani wrote 
he added the sad fact however is that israel is unable and 
undoubtedly also unwilling to make farreaching concessions at this 
stage

pope john paul ii called sunday for a new 
culture of solidarity that would protect the sick and elderly and 
outlaw abortion 
in his noon angelus address from his window overlooking st 
peters square the pope noted that italys roman catholic church on 
sunday was observing the day of life 
cardinal ugo poletti head of the italian bishops conference 
led a march of 3000 people from romes sant andrea delle valle 
church to st peters the group carried signs with slogans such as 
yes to life 
john paul said he hoped the initiative would increase the 
common awareness and responsibility in one of the most dramatic 
problems of our time 
the future of man is threatened in some countries by the 
decline of births by the aging of the population by the widespread 
recourse to abortion by the thousands of forms of egoism the 
pope told the crowd of 15000 people gathered in the square 
a new culture of solidarity is needed he added the life 
of each person including the one waiting to be born the one sick 
or weak the one in decline is an absolute and intangible gift it 
is a gift of all and for all

grandmasters jan timman of the 
netherlands and lajos portisch of hungary agreed to a draw without 
resuming play sunday in the adjourned fourth game of their world 
chess championship candidates quarterfinal 
the bishops and pawns ending had been declared a certain point 
splitter by chessperts when portisch sealed his 62nd move after 
an exciting sixhour battle from a ruy lopez the day before 
but timman who was playing white painstakingly analyzed the 
position overnight with his seconds in the hope of getting more out 
of the game than the half point earned by a draw 
late sunday morning he called up his opponent in the antwerp 
hotel where the match is being played to propose signing the peace 
portisch now leading 21 in the sixgame knockout match 
accepted and informed yugoslav referee svetozar gligoric of the 
outcome 
the draw meant a serious setback for the 37yearold timman who 
desperately needed a victory to catch up with the 51yearold 
hungarian 
with only two more games to go in the match his chances of 
gaining a berth in the semifinals seemed slim 
a win in mondays fifth game in which timman will be playing 
with black was considered unlikely by the experts following the 
antwerp duel 
portisch will be satisfied with a draw explained dutch 
grandmaster genna sosonko and hes such an able defender that 
timman would be taking a great risk indeed if he tries to win with 
black the match might be over at once 
according to sosonko timman will wait for the sixth game 
scheduled for wednesday to try and tie the score 
if he then manages a win with white the match will be extended 
with two more games to be followed by suddendeath rapid contests 
if the tie persists 
the antwerp match is one of a series to select a challenger who 
will play world champion gary kasparov for his title in 1990 
on saturday arthur yusupov of the soviet union defeated canadas 
kevin spraggett in their first rapid game in quebec to reach the 
semifinals while former soviet world champion anatoly karpov was 
well on his way to a victory over johann hjartarson of iceland in

photographs of the body of rudolf hess suggest 
adolf hitlers 93yearold deputy may have been murdered at spandau 
prison in west berlin in 1987 the sunday observer newspaper 
reported 
the liberal weekly said it studied the pictures which were 
brought to london by hess son wolf rudiger hess hess met friday 
with scotland yard detectives investigating suggestions his father 
did not commit suicide said the paper 
the photographs were part of a postmortem report by wolfgang 
spann of munich who suggested the nazi leader died as a result of 
deliberate strangulation rather than hanging the paper said 
the first postmortem by james cameron of london university said 
hess death was a suicide by hanging 
dr hugh thomas a former british army doctor who examined the 
spandau prisoner in 1973 was quoted as telling the observer the 
photographs from spanns examination show hess was murdered 
if a person hangs to death you would expect that the line of 
the cord would run diagonally across the back of his neck but the 
photographs of hess show a mark straight across the line also 
continues around the front of the neck suggesting he was killed by 
strangulation rather than hanging thomas was quoted as saying 
in two books thomas has contended hess was murdered in 1941 
while flying to scotland on a peace mission and an impersonator in a 
second plane was substituted by plotters among hitlers deputies 
thomas claims the imposter spent 46 years in hess place at 
spandau and alleges he was murdered in 1987 to stop the leak of 
details of a world war ii plot by powerful britons to overthrow 
prime minister winston churchill 
wolf rudiger hess maintains the spandau prisoner was his father 
and that he probably was murdered on aug 17 1987 because of 
allied fears he might disclose secrets about his flight to scotland 
in 1941 
in a statement saturday scotland yard would not disclose who it 
has interviewed for its investigation into hess death which is 
being conducted at the request of the director of public 
prosecutions 
at the nuremberg war crimes trials hess was sentenced to life 
imprisonment with no possibility of parole for preparing and 
waging an aggressive war

iranian president ali khamenei said sunday 
that diplomatic relations with washington will not be possible until 
the united states abandons its hostile posture toward iran tehran 
radio said 
there can be no change in our stance against america unless 
there is a change in american foreign policy toward iran the 
official broadcast monitored in nicosia quoted khamenei as saying 
what forces us into our present stance against the united 
states is its hostile and extremely conspiratorial behavior toward 
the islamic republic and the revolution 
what can cause change in the present situation is surely a 
change in this hostile attitude and a change in americas policy of 
domination khamenei said 
after virtually isolating itself from the international community 
during the iraniraq war tehran has been opening doors to both east 
and west bloc countries since the aug 20 ceasefire 
but antiamericanism still is a cornerstone of tehrans foreign 
policy 
khamenei also condemned israeli actions in the occupied 
territories and south africas policy of race segregation he said 
iran would not establish ties with either of those countries 
the united states severed ties with iran soon after the 1979 
revolution when fundamentalist militants took over the us embassy 
in tehran they held 52 americans hostage 444 days

the northern california science writers association sponsored the 
contest last month during the annual meeting of the american 
association for the advancement of science held in san francisco 
science writer james cornell publications manager at the 
harvardsmithsonian center for astrophysics in cambridge mass 
swept first second and third places with letters that landed on his 
desk 
the winning entry came from a cambridge woman befuddled by news 
of mass mating rituals amongs frogs in malaysia 
what i have been wondering is whether all those different kinds 
of frogs managed to find their own kind of frog to mate with what 
with the crowds and confusion and all or whether they got all mixed 
up which would mean that by now we are faced with the spectre of 
ever new varieties of weirdo frogs she wrote 
also what were the poisonous toads doing there theyre not 
frogs after all and why should they even bother showing up at a 
frog orgy just because they happen to be amphibious and hop 
detroit free press science writer nancy rossflanigan got an 
ungrammatical letter from a man who didnt know earth rotates as the 
moon orbits it 
the moon is supposed to travel around the earth in a month 
time then what is this moon that revolve around the city of detroit 
every day to every other day and what is it doing he asked 
in another letter to cornell a cincinnati man asserted his 
12year study of mars photographs resulted in irrefutable evidence 
of a civilized society of intelligent beings on the red planet 
cornell said the writers of such letters are harmless they 
just have a skewed view of what the world is i wouldnt want anyone 
to make fun of them they are simply attempting to establish 
their own version of scientific reality 
charlie petit a san francisco chronicle science writer and 
president of the national association of science writers got a 
letter from a man who theorized continents formed and life on earth 
started when a moon named yasoon hit the planet 
such correspondents mean to be serious and while their ideas 
may be silly and funny i would never regard the people who think 
of them as ridiculous petit said i tip my hat to them for 
daring to say things that elicit giggles i would not want to be a 
member of a society where nobody came up with crazy ideas 
some offer more than ideas 
i am willing to have one of my hands amputated and 
scientifically demonstrate how regenerative medicine works as a 
result a new hand will grow back said a brazilian mans letter 
to a scientist at the university of california irvine 
the scientist forwarded the letter to freelancer lynne timpani 
friedmann then a university spokeswoman with a note saying 
please add this to the whacko file 
the contests secondplace letter written by a texas man began 
dear sir it is generally believed by scientists that the earth is 
a giant magnet but this is not quite true the earth is in 
reality a giant photoelectric cell 
in third place from south carolina was this complete letter 
dear presidents directors and other communications coordinators 
global abstinence from march 15 through april 15 combined with 
curative measures as needed can virtually eradicate gonorrhea and 
much more how many months have 11 days

with plans for sweeping changes in britains free 
health system prime minister margaret thatchers freemarket 
revolution has reached a national institution as sacrosanct as the 
royal family 
after years of increasing spending on an evermore costly ideal 
of free and equal treatment for all 56 million britons mrs 
thatcher last week announced the most radical shakeup of the 
national health service since its foundation 40 years ago 
the health service will remain free to the customers but the 
prime ministers plan is to create an internal market in state 
medicine by 1991 with a price on everything from aspirin to a heart 
transplant doctors and hospitals will compete for statefunded fees 
the 320 biggest hospitals will be able to become selfgoverning 
setting individual pay scales and wooing private and state patients 
patients over the age of 60 the biggest burden on the state health 
service will get tax breaks for having private insurance 
the national health service will continue to be available to 
all regardless of income and to be financed mainly out of general 
taxation said mrs thatcher we aim to extend patient choice 
and to secure the best value for money 
the system mrs thatcher envisions is a far cry from the mainly 
private us system widely perceived in britain as a recipe for 
greed and wastefulness and one that dumps the poor and chronically 
ill in substandard public hospitals 
but critics on the left charge her proposals are the first step 
down a favorite thatcher road privatization 
in the nearly 10 years since mrs thatcher won power her 
frontline targets have been the bureaucracies and the vested 
interests of the left she has sought to emasculate labor unions 
sell off stateowned industries and curb the powers of leftwing 
local authorities 
through it all the national health service with one million 
employees treating 30 million people a year kept growing the cost 
has soared by a third to 378 billion since 1979 always trailing 
demands for evermore expensive drugs and sophisticated surgery 
every working briton has to pay 10 percent of his salary toward 
the state health and pension plan and 90 percent of the people 
not including mrs thatcher use the state service as opposed to 
private doctors and hospitals 
most britons suspect mrs thatcher would like to dismantle the 
system the cornerstone of the welfare state 
the prime minister ordered the review of the health system a year 
ago in an effort to break the cycle of spending money and earning 
political criticism from a service in which children die waiting for 
heart surgery and nurses are driven to pay strikes 
the new proposals are virtually certain of implementation because 
of mrs thatchers big majority in parliament 
the opposition labor party said the plan reflects a conservative 
party government that will always put a healthy balance sheet 
before healthy patients 
the countrys major health union calls it a charter for a 
commercial circus and the doctors organization the british 
medical association also expressed doubts 
the government says the plan will increase efficiency and cut 
waiting lists 
i dont want the health service run as a business argued 
health secretary kenneth clarke on a nationwide tour to sell the 
plan i just want it to be more businesslike 
this means taking a closer look at the performances of family 
doctors and consultants 
consultants who get about 87500 a year from the health 
service will be monitored on whether they are neglecting state 
commitments to treat private patients 
salaries of the 32500 stateemployed general practitioners now 
earning an average 47000 a year more or less irrespective of 
competence will be more closely related to the number of patients 
on their books 
big practices will get budgets to buy hospital treatment at the 
best price doctors will be fined for prescribing drugs too readily 
selfgoverning hospitals will be forced to run emergency services 
and general practitioners will get extra payments for taking on 
costly and difficult patients 
after generations of socialized medicine many are uneasy about 
the new emphasis on money and costs 
some critics predict a rush for the glamorous or highpaying 
work with no takers for aids patients or the very old others fear 
doctors may come to be seen as too concerned with money 
at the moment if we tell a patient they dont need an 
antibiotic or an xray they know we are doing it in their own 
interests said dr robert lorge a country doctor in hampshire in 
southern england 
but if they think we are trying to boost our income by saving 
on our budget it could subtly alter the whole way we are viewed by 
our patients

a highminded mayoral campaign in the city where 
politicians often travel the low road once seemed as likely as a 
january without snow or ice but chicagoans are basking in the balmy 
political clime 
things have been so quiet that i got back from a vacation 
looked at the papers and thought maybe the plane had landed in 
minneapolis said mike royko the chicago tribunes pulitzer 
prizewinning columnist 
with three weeks remaining before the feb 28 democratic primary 
political analysts attribute the relative calm to the personalities 
involved acting mayor eugene sawyer 54 and frontrunner richard 
m daley 44 the cook county states attorney and son of the late 
mayor richard j daley a third candidate alderman lawrence bloom 
is not considered a factor in the primary race 
in this heavily democratic city the winner of the primary is 
nearly assured of victory the general election is april 4 
all has not been sweetness and light between sawyer who is 
black and daley who is white 
sawyer has tried on occasion to stir up the bad memories some 
blacks have of daleys father because of the riots that followed the 
assassination in 1968 of the rev martin luther king jr more 
recently he charged that daley covered up the involvement of those 
in his office who may have collected bogus petition signatures 
daley in turn has accused sawyer of trying to tax his way out 
of a financial bind and suggested his opponent has accomplished 
little on his own since being installed as mayor by the city council 
in december 1987 shortly after mayor harold washington died 
but neither side has resorted to the mudslinging or the politics 
of race that marked both the 1983 campaign that culminated in 
washingtons election as the citys first black mayor and 
washingtons successful 1987 reelection campaign 
the issues chiefly crime education and affordable housing 
have received a more thorough airing than during any of the previous 
elections this decade 
the civility might seem especially surprising in light of recent 
polls showing daley with a commanding lead support for the countys 
top prosecutor has been hovering at about 50 percent against about 
30 percent for sawyer 10 percent for bloom and 10 percent undecided 
the same polls have shown daley with support from as much as 15 
percent to 20 percent of the black electorate athough the 
endorsement of sawyer by jesse jackson on jan 24 may result in some 
slippage 
chicagos population is roughly 40 percent white 40 percent 
black 15 percent hispanic and less than 5 percent people of other 
races 
political observers say the agreeable natures of both candidates 
are not the only reason for the calm 
the mud just doesnt seem to be sticking said eugene 
kennedy a loyola university professor and author of himself a 
biography of the elder daley the last of the bigcity political 
bosses 
maybe its because people are worn out by the spate of 
political campaigns over the last two years or because both men 
have their base constituencies intact and are down to fighting 
for the mostly liberal swing vote who like nice clean candidates 
but what i would call an almost unnatural calm is quite 
frankly probably more the result of two men running who are neither 
exciting nor willing nor perhaps even able to engage the voters 
imagination kennedy concluded theyre even scared of debating 
one another 
a debate tuesday is the only one scheduled between daley and 
sawyer the two have sparred over the terms of other proposed 
debates 
clarence page a member of the tribunes editorial board and 
frequent political commentator said another element contributing to 
the peaceful campaign is the citys newfound political maturity 
for one thing politics here were retarded for years because we 
had a political machine under the elder daley that for decades 
stunted peoples aspirations especially in the minority 
communities page said 
harold washington sort of ushered us beyond that he showed 
whites there was no reason to fear a black mayor he showed blacks 
the political process was a legitimate channel to gain power 
but just as the weather took a turn for the worse last week 
royko kennedy and page agree that the campaign could too if 
sawyer panics and thinks hes too far behind or daley decides hes 
not far enough ahead 
all three also say a daley win in the primary could cause blacks 
to adopt more desperate measures when alderman tim evans who is 
black and like sawyer was part of the late mayor washingtons 
coalition makes his thirdparty challenge in the general election 
but when you consider weve got this far and everybodys been 
as a nice as they are page said thats already quite an 
accomplishment

a 50 percent pay raise for congress the folks 
back home arent mincing words in letting congressmen know they 
think its a terrible idea 
dont you dare let the salary increase go through said a 
telegram to sen gordon humphrey rnh who opposes the raise 
another letterwriter said the issue has my hair on fire 
cant congress do the same as ordinary people do asked a 
letter to sen john mccain rariz who also voted against the 
raise on thursday tighten their belts spend less on luxuries and 
pleasures and still enjoy life the writer advised 
i have never received such vicious mail said rep bill 
richardson dnm he said constituents were promising to vote 
against him even if the pay raise took effect over his objections 
ed senn an aide to rep tom tauke riowa a leading opponent of 
the pay increase said the letters were pouring in 
if you stack them up they would be kneedeep senn said 
adding that the letters differ from the form letters congressmen 
typically get when they are considering tax and banking issues 
this is different because its not preprinted post cards its the 
heartfelt handwritten letters 
the raise in lawmakers pay to 135000 from the current 89500 
will automatically take effect next wednesday unless the house 
follows the senates lead in rejecting it house speaker jim wright 
dtexas hopes both houses will roll the raise back to 30 percent 
the next day but some congressmen have said they would rather work 
to repeal it altogether 
some of the constituent letters are as simple as president bushs 
promise not to raise taxes read my lips no 50 percent pay 
raise said one note to humphrey another said just say no to 
pay raise the thought of it is ridiculous 
the taxpayer is rightfully enraged one arizonan wrote to 
mccain an elderly person wrote i have worked scrapped and saved 
all my life the good old american way or so weve been told 
and one letterwriter urged congressmen to show some backbone 
display the courage that you all claimed you had during the 
campaign 
sen christopher dodd dconn said he realizes much of his mail 
opposes his stand in favor of the raise dodd wants to ban honoraria 
and raise the salary to 125300 which is the total of the current 
89500 pay and the maximum amount of honoraria senators now may 
accept for making speeches 
no one likes to be against your constituency or appear to be 
against your constituents dodd said but i happen to believe 
that you should be honest and straightforward and vote for these 
things 
many people do not understand that senators now supplement their 
pay by accepting honoraria from specialinterest groups dodd said 
adding that he tries to explain to them he prefers that congressmen 
get a straight salary instead of taking money from those groups 
humphrey spokeswoman lisa lyons said the pay raise mail is not 
the heaviest her office has received on a single subject the 
controversy over former president reagans nomination of robert bork 
to the supreme court brought in many more letters she said 
one new hampshire resident wrote a fivestanza poem to humphrey 
that included this gem while you work hard to save a dime so 
some can feel carefree the deficit is another thing to worry you 
and me 
tauke said his mail included only a few backing a pay raise but 
they came from good friends who want me to have a raise be kind 
to your child he said the letters advised him

the bitter cold that staggered alaska and then 
headed south ending five weeks of unusually warm weather in the 
northernmost state is just the latest in a series of unusual 
weather events that have marked the past year 
take for example the heat and drought that battered much of the 
nation last summer that helped maintain a pattern of weather 
disasters in this country every 50 years 
great blizzards staggered both the great plains and the northeast 
a century ago in 1888 while the long island express one of the 
worst hurricanes to batter the northeast struck in 1938 
of course there have been plenty of weatherrelated disasters in 
other years too 
a look back at 1988 does show that the united states wasnt alone 
in facing odd weather during the year problems from heat to cold to 
drought to excessive moisture were felt around the world 
were these events known to meteorologists as weather anomalies 
related to one another not in any obvious way researchers say 
and how about the theory that gases added to the atmosphere are 
causing a greenhouselike warming of the planet 
backers of that idea might find support in the droughts and heat 
in the united states and argentina 
but itll probably be hard to sell the greenhouse theory to 
residents of alaskan owns where the temperature dipped to 70 degrees 
and more below zero particularly since the greenhouse theory holds 
that any warming should be felt more strongly at the poles than in 
other areas 
whether the hot summer cold alaskan january or other weather 
represents any sort of trend will not likely be sorted out quickly 
the weather after all varies widely from year to year and 
normal is just the average of those variations 
the drought was strong and got a lot of press but these types 
of deviations are going to happen each year somewhere commented 
richard j tinker of the federal climate analysis center 
at any rate the heat and drought that struck this nation in the 
breadbasket was probably the most significant weather event of the 
year being the most severe drought since the dust bowl year of 
1936 according to the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration 
the drought extended from the northern rockies across the great 
plains to the gulf coast and southeast 
crop yields were reduced and dryness remains a threat in many 
areas where farmers are hoping for winter snows to moisten the 
parched ground 
the drought was aggravated by extreme heat with the 
northcentral states and canada experiencing the hottest summer in 
at least 38 years hundreds of heat records were topped before 
relief came in late august 
but while that hot spell attracted the headlines it was almost 
completely balanced and the nations average temperature for the 
year came out near to normal 
helping keep the balance were the bitter cold that swept across 
much of the nation in january 1988 a cold spell in the northeast in 
april and may an unusually cool october in the midwest and a 
middecember cold snap in the northeast 
in addition to the severe heat and drought in the united states 
and canada last summer here is a look at some other unusual weather 
conditions around the world during 1988 
drought struck the major farming area of northern argentina in 
june and has persisted for more than 30 weeks it was accompanied 
during much of the period by warmer than normal temperatures 
although that has now moderated somewhat affected in addition to 
argentina are adjacent areas of other nations including uruguay 
paraguay and brazil 
dry conditions prevailed across much of east central china 
during the summer broken by occasional extreme thunderstorms by 
the end of august southern china was plagued by extraordinarily wet 
weather followed by less than half the normal rainfall for the last 
three months of the year 
in the middle of may a cold spell plagued the southern 
twothirds of south america lasting until the end of june and 
bringing freezing temperatures as far north as the coffeegrowing 
regions of brazil 
very hot weather baked south central asia with a severe heat 
wave in may and june a good monsoon season brought plenty of 
moisture and moderated the heat over india although the heavy rains 
triggered some landslides and flooding 
spring was extremely wet over europe from scandinavia to 
switzerland although the problem had moderated by may unusually 
moist conditiones continued to plague scotland through september 
however 
southeastern siberia northeastern china and korea had unusually 
warm weather from october through december 
torrential rains struck botswana south africa and zimbabwe in 
february and persisted through april in some areas 
january and february of 1988 were unusually mild across most of 
europe with the warmest weather over the united kingdom and central 
europe 
however november and december proved unusually cold over 
eastern europe and the middle east winter storms with snow and high 
winds ranged from denmark to germany to greece and even the middle 
east 
australia was hot and dry for the first three months of the year 
before cooler temperatures and rainfall moderated conditions

a ussoviet public opinion poll has found good 
will among residents of moscow and four american cities despite 
fears over their nations longstanding rivalry 
majorities in moscow and in the us cities saw the superpowers 
as friendly the survey found and more than eight in 10 agreed the 
two nations were entering a new era of peace and cooperation 
at the same time nearly four in 10 muscovites saw the united 
states as a serious threat to their nation and as many or more of 
the americans saw the soviets as a threat to the united states the 
survey found 
the poll was sponsored by wcvbtv in boston the detroit free 
press the daily news and wcbs television and radio in new york and 
krontv in san francisco it was conducted by telephone dec 1525 
among approximately 1000 adults each in moscow and new york and 
about 600 each in boston detroit and san francisco it had a 
threepoint margin of error for the larger samples four for the 
smaller ones the results were published last week 
the survey measured social as well as political views providing 
for comparisons of the beliefs and lifestyles of the soviets and 
americans in the cities where it was conducted 
muscovites for example were considerably more confident in 
their government with 37 percent saying they always can trust it to 
do whats right just 6 percent of the americans said the same of 
their government 
but more of the americans had great pride in their nationality 
depending on the city about seven in 10 said they were very proud 
to be americans in moscow four in 10 were very proud to be soviets 
the americans were far more content with the goods and services 
available to them and more positive about their economy more than 
half said their lives had improved in recent years compared with 37 
percent of muscovites 
among other findings 
the moscow residents socialized less frequently than the 
americans and were far less likely to eat in restaurants or attend 
sporting events nearly half the muscovites said they never 
exercised no more than a quarter of the americans said that 
the muscovites were far more avid readers than the americans 
with 61 percent saying they sat down to read a book almost daily 
that was twice the number of daily readers for example in boston 
american respondents were more aware of several international 
figures nearly four in 10 of the muscovites said they had never 
heard of libyan leader moammar gadhafi and a quarter said they had 
never heard of pope john paul ii or ayatollah khomeini of iran 
far more of the americans said they had a family member or a 
friend who had at some time had a drug problem 26 percent or more 
compared with just 3 percent in moscow although more americans also 
said someone close to them drank too much pollsters said the 
muscovites could have been holding back on that question because of 
a government crackdown on alcohol abuse 
at least twothirds of the americans said religion was important 
in their daily lives compared with just 13 percent of muscovites 
eighty percent or more of the americans in each city believed in 
god compared with 10 percent of the moscow residents 
majorities of the muscovites and americans alike said the united 
states offered better health care and was ahead in science and 
technology but they also agreed the united states had more 
discrimination against minorities 
whatever their nations differences at least threequarters of 
the americans in each city said they had a generally favorable 
impression of the soviet people similarly eight in 10 soviets 
thought well of americans 
the survey was conducted in the united states by two polling 
companies market opinion research and marttila amp kiley and in 
moscow by the institute for sociology a branch of the soviet 
academy of sciences with monitoring by the us pollsters

as the soviets leave afghanistan a correspondent 
from the aps moscow bureau joined a military convoy as it covered 
the final miles to the border he filed this report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
their faces reddened by the sun and 
streaked with dirt the sons of russia drove a growling convoy of 
armor to the border of their homeland and the end of their 
involvement in the afghan war 
three days out of the afghan capital kabul the thread of 
muddied military green on sunday reached the amu darya river which 
marks the border between afghanistan and the soviet union 
of course were looking forward to going home said 
blueeyed andrei ogarkov of moscow poking his head from the turret 
of a light tank the seventh in the 65vehicle convoy he said his 
seven months in afghanistan were enough 
the convoy ground its way homeward through the hindu kush 
mountains and the salang pass where heavy fighting occurred a week 
ago between antimarxist rebels and the afghan army backed by soviet 
artillery and warplanes 
soldiers in the convoy said there was no fighting as they made 
their way north but that a few of their fellows were killed and 
several vehicles destroyed in an avalanche 
the soviet soldiers will cross the border monday when an 
official welcoming ceremony is to be held in termez a border town 
in the soviet republic of uzbekistan they bivouacked sunday night 
in hayratan along with other returning soviets and some said they 
expected wives and family members to greet them when they crossed 
into termez 
on sunday mi24 helicopters scoured the sand dunes along the 
highway as the convoy finished its trip 
as they headed home ahead of the feb 15 deadline for withdrawal 
of all soviet soldiers from afghanistan soldiers expressed 
ambivalence about their nineyear military intervention and 
uncertainty about the shaky prosoviet government they leave behind 
the soviet policy in afghanistan brought nothing said tank 
commander andrei yevryolin speaking to foreign reporters who rode 
for an hour atop his tank until the convoy reached hayratan 
at a military outpost near the northern afghan city of 
mazarisharif 30yearold capt arkady anonich bluntly answered 
no when asked if he thought the local people supported the 
government of president najib 
he told journalists the kremlins decision to send soldiers to 
afghanistan in december 1979 had been illconsidered 
there should have been another way to settle this conflict 
he said 
anonich said the afghan army was weak in technical expertise and 
suffered low morale 
another soviet army captain sergei ofitserov said the 
afghans will have to work it out for themselves now we will only 
get in the way 
the convoy that reached the border sunday included tanks armored 
cars armored personnel carriers and trucks some trucks were 
missile carriers but their beds were covered with tarpaulins 
making it impossible to tell if they were transporting missiles 
the convoy was part of a mighty armada of soviet military power 
that has been heading north from kabul in the past week soviet and 
afghan officials in kabul have estimated there are only about 1000 
soviet soldiers left in afghanistan including a garrison at the 
capitals airport 
the convoy raised a trail of dust and exhaust fumes as it roared 
up the main road to termez which is already indented by the tracks 
of hundreds of vehicles that have passed through during the years of 
soviet involvement in afghanistan 
the column passed destroyed chassis of jeeps and other military 
vehicles the refuse of war and outposts where armored vehicles 
were dug into sand dunes to protect the withdrawal route 
as it ground its way toward the border the convoy passed small 
groups of afghans who watched silently knowing that with the red 
armys departure the fate of najibs government was more in 
question than ever

the chance discovery of a cache of nearly 
forgotten photographs by ansel adams has yielded a new book with a 
haunting insiders view of the internment camps where more than 
120000 japaneseamericans were held captive during world war ii 
the insider was adams himself the renowned scenic photographer 
who left yosemite national park with his cameras in the fall of 1943 
to visit an internment camp at manzanar in the windswept desert 
along the eastern edge of californias sierra nevada 
it was there that adams made his first and only attempt to 
shoot a photo documentary the photographer sympathetic to the 
plight of the innocent inhabitants published some of the pictures 
in born free and equal a book he later wrote about manzanar 
but the wartime publics reaction was hostile copies were burned 
in protest and the photographers shows were canceled adams let 
the copyright expire and gave the negatives and handsigned prints 
to the library of congress in the 1960s 
not long after adams death in 1984 peter wright a news photo 
editor at the associated press in washington was spending his day 
off rummaging through the librarys vast collection of original 
photographs and negatives 
wright came across a catalogue card listing the negatives of 
adams manzanar pictures curious he asked to see them 
up came about a dozen cases of 11by14 prints about 240 of 
them all handsigned by adams along with the negatives wright 
said 
it was unbelievable these pictures had been mentioned in 
several books about adams but i had only seen one or two of the 
published prints suddenly to see the whole collection was amazing 
now with access to rare and highly valuable photographs hidden 
away in a vault at the library of congress for two decades wright 
turned to friend john armor a constitutional lawyer who has studied 
the legal controversy over the wartime internment of 
japaneseamericans 
together they reviewed piles of documents at the national 
archives and the library of congress some of them only recently 
declassified and wrote a book illustrated with 90 of adams 
photographs from the manzanar camp 
manzanar containing a lengthy foreword by novelist john 
hersey entitled a mistake of terrifically horrible proportions 
was published last november by times books a division of random 
house inc 
all the principals who contributed to the book felt outrage at 
what happened to the more than 10000 americans of japanese descent 
who were rounded up as security risks and shipped to manzanar in the 
spring of 1942 a few months after pearl harbor 
thousands more were herded into nine other relocation centers 
in california arizona utah colorado wyoming and arkansas they 
were crowded into tarpaper barracks used communal toilets and had 
no telephones or automobiles many of them staying there for 3 
years 
so much we left behind said one inmate but the most 
valuable thing i lost was my freedom 
though invited to manzanar by the camp director an old friend 
adams was forbidden to photograph the barbedwire fences or the 
guard towers with searchlights and machine guns that surrounded the 
camp city 
jonathan segal editorial director of times books said in a 
telephone interview from new york that he was shocked when he 
saw adams photographs 
i thought what did these people do wrong segal said 
who had the authority to do this where was our moral courage our 
american principle of youre innocent until proved guilty 
in his foreword hersey called the governments internment policy 
the bitterest national shame of the second world war for the sweet 
land of liberty 
hersey 74 is the pulitzer prizewinning author of 
hiroshima published in 1946 in an interview from his key west 
fla home hersey saw no parallel between the united states atomic 
bomb attack on that japanese city and its internment of 
japaneseamerican citizens at home 
although hiroshima was a human horror he said it shortened 
the war and averted further heavy loss of lives but the domestic 
internment of japaneseamericans was a very serious lapse in our 
dearest traditions of respect for civil liberties 
armor said his book research only reinforced his conviction that 
the supreme courts 1944 decision sanctioning internment was an 
abomination he said the ruling was based on suppressed evidence 
that claims of potential disloyalty by japaneseamericans were 
totally groundless 
wright now believes strongly that what we did to those people 
was wrong and unjust 
i think we finished the project that adams felt very dearly 
about so many years ago wright said 
last august president reagan signed legislation authorizing 
reparations of 20000 in taxfree payments to each of the estimated 
60000 internment camp survivors the justice department says it 
hopes to begin disbursing payments by next october after eligible 
recipients are located

a former prime minister escaped with 
minor bruises sunday when three bombs exploded at a campaign rally 
and security guards responded by firing randomly nearly 40 people 
were reported injured 
sirimavo bandaranaike who has become a top opposition leader 
since leaving office said the attempt on her life failed when a 
bodyguard kicked away a grenade that was thrown at her before it 
could explode she survived a similar assassination attempt in 
december while campaigning for president 
five thousand people were attending the outdoor rally when 
unidentified assailants hurled the explosives just as mrs 
bandaranaike stood up to make a speech kicking off her partys 
campaign for the feb 15 general election 
a military official in colombo who cannot be identified under 
briefing rules said at least 38 people were injured 14 seriously 
in the attack in hingurakgoda a remote town 100 miles northeast of 
colombo 
many were shot by mrs bandaranaikes security guards who shot 
randomly after the bombs exploded the bodyguards panicked and 
opened up with rifles pistols and shotguns injuring a lot of 
people he said 
authorities said they were unsure who was behind the attack at 
least 10 candidates including six from mrs bandaranaikes party 
have been killed in the past month by suspected sinhalese militants 
the attack came one day after at least 13 people were killed in 
sri lanka in violence related to the election 
mrs bandaranaike 72 sustained minor bruises in a stampede that 
followed the explosions a member of her opposition sri lanka 
freedom party said 
mrs bandaranaike was elected the worlds first woman prime 
minister in 1960 she ruled until 1965 and then again from 197077 
her husband swrd bandaranaike was prime minister when he 
was assassinated by a buddhist monk in 1959 
she is now president of the sri lanka freedom party the nations 
main opposition group she was the runnerup in the presidential 
election dec 19 losing to ranasinghe premadasa of the united 
national party 
her party has promised to reduce ethnic conflict between minority 
tamils and the majority sinhalese to send back indian soldiers 
enforcing a peace accord and to avoid the socialist policies she 
once promoted as prime minister 
the election for 225 seats in parliament will select the next 
prime minister a post less powerful than that of president 
mrs bandaranaike refused sunday to say who might have staged the 
attack we are not going to say anything at the moment she told 
reporters in the nearby town of anuradhapura weve got our own 
investigations going 
both sinhalese militants and tamil rebels oppose the holding of 
general elections but for different reasons 
the sinhalese militants who also oppose the peace plan have 
vowed to disrupt the voting as part of their antigovernment 
campaign launched in 1987 
sinhalese extremists say the july 29 1987 accord designed to 
end the tamil separatist struggle gives the tamils too many 
concessions 
most tamil rebel groups approved the accord but the largest 
militia the liberation tigers of tamil eelam reneged on the plan 
and has since targeted moderate tamils whom they regard as traitors 
sinhalese form 75 percent of the countrys 16 million people and 
control the government and military tamils who make up 18 percent 
of the population claim they are discriminated against by the 
sinhalese 
at least 8500 people have been killed in the tamil separatist 
war since it was launched in 1983 the sinhalese extremists have 
been blamed for another 1000 killings since july 1987

agreed upon internationally with the exception of the israeli 
stance 
and regrettably they israel are supported by the american 
stance he added

settlement be negotiated at an international conference under the 
aegis of only the two superpowers the united states and the soviet 
union 
arabs want an international conference under the umbrella of the 
united nations with participation of all five permanent members of

britain france and china they also want the palestine liberation 
organization represened at the talks a suggestion rejected by

solidarity is poised to return to center 
stage monday when opposition and government leaders start 
negotiating political reforms that could restore the banned 
organizatons legal status and transform parliament 
sixty chairs for delegates have been placed around a round table 
at namiestnikowski government palace in downtown warsaw but 
interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak and solidarity leader lech 
walesa are the key negotiators 
other delegates are from the official trade union alliance opzz 
the peasants party and democratic party 
kiszczak a politburo member proposed the talks in august 1988 
during nationwide strikes 
the talks will be the first between solidarity as an organization 
and the state since authorities imposed martial law in december 1981 
to crush the soviet blocs only independent trade union solidarity 
was signed into existence 16 months earlier by walesa and 
thenpolitburo member mieczylsaw jagielski 
solidarity remains skeptical of the authorities but both sides 
agree compromise is essential if poland is to grapple with a 389 
billion debt 60 percent inflation chronic consumer shortages and 
threats of labor unrest 
lech walesa believed in 1980 and what came out of it its 
similar now we dont believe the closer we get to it the less 
i believe walesa told other solidarity leaders sunday referring 
to the shattered agreement that first legalized solidarity 
we have to win a lot because there is no other solution for 
poland but a broad economic democratic and political pluralistic 
opening and it will be possible but we should concentrate on 
fighting for it said walesa 
solidaritys team of 25 negotiators includes former underground 
solidarity leader zbigniew bujak and adam michnik and jacek kuron 
two opposition leaders whom authorities initially rejected as 
delegates 
opzz announced last week its eightperson delegation would be 
headed by union leader alfred miodowicz 
kiszczak and walesa met six times to set up the talks but walesa 
refused to commit solidarity until authorities agreed to legalize 
the union 
in a dramatic reversal the central committee on jan 18 approved 
negotiations to legalize the union and four days later solidarity 
agreed to the talks 
prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski has suggested solidarity 
observe a strike moratorium as part of the legalization agreement 
but bronislaw geremek a historian and top solidarity adviser 
taking part in the talks said we wont abandon the right to 
strike but we declare that solidarity will search at any cost to 
avoid strikes 
the second key issue is the electoral law though even if it is 
changed it likely will guarantee the communist party a majority in 
parliament 
authorities have signaled a willingness to allow parliamentary 
candidates from the constructive opposition meaning people 
willing to respect the constitution 
solidarity insists it wants to be a trade union not a political 
party but geremek said a citizens committee set up under walesas 
leadership in december eventually could recommend candidates for 
parliament 
the party demands solidarity be a trade union but it insists 
solidarity become politically engaged geremek said the key 
problem on the elections will be between those who want to reproduce 
their power and those who want free elections 
solidarity says it also wants to discuss legal reforms to create 
a more independent judiciary freedom of clubs and associations 
access to the mass media democratization of local government and 
economic reforms to diminish the role of the party in factories

millions of hindus invoking their ancient 
faiths countless gods and goddesses converged sunday at the 
confluence of three rivers whose waters are thought to hold the 
power to wash away sins and end the cycle of birth and rebirth 
at least 10 million people have already come its already a 
sea of humanity said ravindra gupta pointing at the flow of 
worshipers arriving in this central city for the kumbh mela listed 
in the guinness book of world records as the worlds biggest 
religious gathering 
people have already started taking their holy baths they do 
not want to take a chance tomorrow monday said gupta 
allahabads chief administrator 
he said he expects 15 million people at the river banks monday 
the holy fair is held every 12 years by the lunar calendar at the 
time of a rare planetary convergence jupiter in taurus the sun and 
moon in capricorn and a complicated hindu astronomical calculation 
of other planets and stars 
the kumbh mela began jan 14 and lasts seven weeks but monday is 
considered the most auspicious time for bathing in the sacred rivers 
the ganges the yamuna and the saraswati because it is the day 
of the new moon 
this year police on horseback in jeeps at observation posts 
and on foot are keeping close vigils for fear sikh extremists might 
launch attacks at the fair 
we are ready for everything said trinath mishra deputy 
inspector general of police in uttar pradesh state 
this fair is a sitting duck for terrorists but we are no 
goose mishra said we can counter any eventualities 
about 12000 policemen and 5000 militiamen have been deployed 
around the 3000acre fair site there are 25 police watchtowers 
equipped with television monitors 25 police posts 10 river police 
stations and 22 fire stations 
soldiers at a nearby army base are on alert 
allahabad is more than 425 miles from punjab state where radical 
sikhs have been waging a separatist war against indias hindu 
majority 
but sikh gunmen and bombers who have killed about 200 people so 
far this year are so feared that distance offers little consolation 
in the hindi language kumbh means pot and mela means 
fair the festivals name is derived from a fight over a pot of 
nectar 
according to hindu mythology gods and demons were waging a war 
of attrition when each side realized it needed nectar to achieve 
immortality and victory the nectar was hidden beneath an ocean so 
the combatants churned the waters the pot of nectar flew out and 
was seized by vishnu the god of creation who fled across the 
heavens 
during vishnus flight drops of nectar fell at 12 spots four of 
the sites including allahabad are in india while the rest are in 
heaven 
holy fairs are held at the three other indian sites but 
allahabad is considered the holiest site because it lies at the 
confluence of three sacred rivers 
the pilgrims will bathe in the ganges and yamuna the saraswati 
is invisible to the human eye but hindu faithful believe it flows 
under the ground 
they also believe that if they bathe at the exact spot where the 
nectar fell and at the most auspicious time they will receive 
salvation from the birth cycle 
hindus believe every human is born and after death is reborn 
true salvation is when the human soul escapes this cycle and becomes 
a higher being 
the rush to the rivers has proved fatal in past years 
more than 50 people died in a stampede in 1986 at a fair in 
hardwar and in 1954 about 800 pilgrims died in a stampede at 
allahabad the various holy sites conduct their festivals in 
different years because of different planetary configurations 
other disasters have befallen the festivals in 1760 about 
18000 people died at hardwar in clashes between different hindu 
sects 
in a big fair like this you have no option but to leave 
certain things to fate said mp ashnata chief government 
spokesman for uttar pradesh state we can try to prevent a 
stampede but god forbid if it happens what can you do 
on a more mundane level authorities have tried to cope with 
logistical problems by providing parking space for 200000 vehicles 
and docking space for 5000 boats at least 400 extra trains have 
been routed to allahabad 
more than 10000 tons of wheat 4000 tons of rice and 2000 tons 
of sugar have been stockpiled each day brings fresh deliveries of 
13000 gallons of milk 10 tons of butter and five tons of cheese

as chineseamericans prepare to mark their 
new year on monday they remain newcomers to america despite 150 
years in the united states and a population close to 1 million a 
new book argues 
the reason a succession of repressive discriminatory laws 
enacted after immigrants many from famineravaged regions in china 
were recruited to work in gold rush mining camps lay track for 
the transcontinental railroad reclaim mississippi delta farmland 
and help settle the west 
in chinese american portraits published by chronicle books 
san franciscoborn ruthanne lum mccunn examines the legislation and 
how chineseamericans from miners to doctors struggled to survive 
the result said the daughter of an american man and chinese 
woman has been generations of disrupted family and cultural ties 
that left chineseamericans where they really dont belong 
anywhere 
the chinese community in the united states consists largely of 
immigrants yet to become citizens or recently naturalized who have 
banded together and lean on old world traditions said mccunn who 
was raised in hong kong 
monday marks the start of the year 4687 the year of the 
snake the major new year celebration is feb 18 
even chineseamericans that have been here for generations are 
often singled out for racist attacks that mccunn argues have abated 
little over the years 
when she and her husband moved to san francisco in 1968 she was 
stunned when the landlord became upset after chinese relatives 
visited their apartment she was told the apartment was for whites 
only and was accused of renting fraudulently 
mccunn who does not appear to be chinese was incensed she put 
a yellow power poster in the window of their front door 
she also said that on several occasions while she spoke with 
chinese friends in mandarin or cantonese on public buses white 
passengers would say to them shut up and speak english 
the profiles in her book include the story of mary bong who left 
china at 15 and became a dairy farmer restaurateur miner and fox 
breeder in alaska yung wing became the first chinese american to 
graduate from an american university when he earned a degree from 
yale in 1854 
all those in chinese american profiles were affected by 
discrimination one of the first antichinese laws came from the 
california legislature which decided in 1852 to tax chinese miners 
3 a month upping it to 4 the following year by the time it was 
nullified in 1870 half of the state governments income derived 
from the tax 
in 1882 all chinese except for students merchants teachers and 
travelers were excluded from immigration for 10 years by federal 
law the law was extended and stayed on the books until 1943 when 
the united states alliance with china made it a political 
embarrassment to continue mccunn said 
even so when the law was repealed just 105 chinese immigrants 
were allowed annually although laws approved in 1948 1953 and 1962 
permitted immigration of almost 25000 additional chinese outside 
the quota 
the reagan administration awarded china an immigration quota of 
20000 a year 
mccunn said immigration quotas and exclusionary laws have 
prevented the chinese from reaching a population par with other 
ethnic minorities in the us 
gradually with the normalization of relations between china 
and america in the 1970s the perception that americans of chinese 
descent were aliens enemy aliens gradually receded she writes 
yet the impression that they are still not quite one hundred 
percent american lingers

the two joint ventures with foreign automakers 
announced by chrysler corp last week are the latest in a group of 
strange bedfellow pairings that analysts say can be beneficial 
to all involved 
chrysler corp last week announced it would hook up with renault 
the french automaker to make a mini sportutility vehicle code 
named the jj earlier in the week the no 3 us automaker said 
it would also sell eagle sedans built in canada by the south korean 
automaker hyundai 
they are the latest in a growing number of joint ventures by us 
and foreign automakers to market vehicles in the united states 
there are a lot of marriages of convenience in this array 
said analyst david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc in new york 
city you have some strange bedfellows 
projects to produce cars and light trucks for the north american 
market involve a variety of automakers and vehicles 
later this year subaru and isuzu two japanese companies will 
begin production of light trucks at a plant in lafayette ind 
general motors corp and suzuki will begin making cars and 
utility vehicles in ingersoll ontario within the next 18 months 
ford motor co and nissan have plans to produce a minivan at an 
expansion of fords avon lake ohio plant in 1991 
there are three joint ventures operating in the united states a 
mitsubishichrysler plant in normal ill operated by diamondstar 
motors a mazdaford plant in flat rock mich run by mazda and 
the first joint venture the gmtoyota new united motor 
manufacturing inc collaboration in fremont calif 
i think the key thing is what you have is a lot of these 
players looking to find some means of utilizing capacity analyst 
joseph phillippi of shearson lehman hutton said of joint ventures 
cheap labor costs in south korea compared with the cost in the 
united states is a major factor in some of the us automaker 
decisions 
fords festiva mitsubishis precis and chevrolets lemans all 
are made in south korea 
in japan mitsubishi makes the colt line for chrysler isuzu 
makes the chevrolet spectrum and suzuki makes the chevrolet sprint 
in the united states the flat rock plant produces the mx6 for 
mazda and the probe for ford nummi makes a variety of small cars 
for toyota and gm the diamondstar plant produces the mitsubishi 
eclipse and plymouth acclaim both twoseat sports cars 
while the intertwining of the companies may be seem as orderly as 
a plate of spaghetti there are specific reasons why automakers get 
involved in joint ventures with foreign companies 
the risk is very low phillippi said its another guys 
plant its his overhead in many cases theres very little that the 
buyer has to put into tooling 
in return the company providing the plant gets access to a 
marketing and distribution system and in some cases a dealership 
network that helps sell the products 
phillippi said gms tracker is a perfect example of the 
multinational vehicle the small sportutility vehicle will be sold 
through gms geo franchises from suzukis plant in ingersoll 
ontario 
you have a geo tracker built in canada with basically japanese 
components sold by a chevrolet dealer he said

that has left at least eight people dead 
seaga one of the united states closest allies in the caribbean 
is rated a 14point underdog in his bid for an unprecedented third 
consecutive term in thursdays election 
a poll published sunday by the daily gleaner an independent 
kingston newspaper said manleys leftleaning peoples national 
party will win a comfortable 36seat majority in the 60seat 
parliament the nationwide sampling of 1024 voters was carried out 
jan 2729 by university of the west indies political scientist carl 
stone no margin of error was stated 
it is jamaicas first nationally contested election since 1980 
when an estimated 700 people were killed in a ninemonth campaign 
manley boycotted the last election in 1983 in a dispute over voter 
registration at a time when his popularity was flagging that gave 
seagas party all 60 parliament seats 
nothing comparable to the 1980 mayhem has occurred but isolated 
shootings firebombings and stonings have left at least eight dead 
and 75 injured since the campaign opened jan 15 
the jamaican capital of kingston which has 1 million 
inhabitants was calm sunday with no evidence of extra security 
last week seaga said manleys party was planning to provoke 
violence to intimidate voters in several constituences where support 
for the two parties is evenly split james kerr an ombudsman 
appointed to investigate claims of political violence said police 
received no complaints or information to substantiate the accusation 
at a rally friday in crofts hill central jamaica manley denied 
the charge we must never allow 1980 to happen again in this 
country he said even if you dont believe i have a good heart 
at least believe im no fool 
seaga signed an executive order saturday calling jamaicas 
national reserve into service to help police and the army keep order 
thursday he said 10000 security force members would be involved in 
the operation 
the issue is particularly sensitive with the election coming at 
the height of the caribbean islands winter tourist season people 
fear an explosion of violence could set back the industrys recovery 
from hurricane gilbert which battered jamaica on sept 12 killing 
45 people and causing 1 billion damage 
jamaica cannot be too proud of its track record in conducting 
elections and should be keenly aware that this time the world is 
watching said a gleaner editorial 
heavily armed gangs roaming kingstons slums traditionally have 
controlled large voting blocs in jamaica the main political parties 
always deny any involvement with the gangs but until this campaign 
they did little to restrain them 
in august seaga and manley signed a peace accord pledging to 
refrain from inflammatory statements and banning the procurement 
or distribution of weapons for use in political activity 
seaga has consistently trailed manley in opinion polls in recent 
years although he closed to within two percentage points shortly 
after hurricane gilbert as he rallied the nation in regular 
television and radio broadcasts 
the charismatic manley has moderated his image since he was prime 
minister for eight years during the 1970s and embraced cuba 
alarming the united states and foreign investors 
now he says he would reopen the cuban embassy closed by seaga in 
1980 but would pursue good relations with president bushs 
administration and western lending agencies 
we will in due course restore formal diplomatic relations with 
cuba but we will do so in a context that ensures that they do not 
again become any source of internal tension and do not cause any 
difficulties in the united states manley said sunday 
seaga 58 who was born in boston and educated at harvard has 
forged extremely close ties with the united states he was the first 
official foreign visitor to ronald reagans white house in 1981 and 
was an outspoken supporter of the 1983 us invasion of grenada 
since taking office in 1980 seaga has restructured the jamaican 
economy raising taxes and laying off thousands of government 
workers the economy has shown steady growth but has never fully 
recovered from the nearcollapse of the vital bauxite industry in 
1983 the standard of living of jamaicas 24 million people has 
continued to fall 
manley 64 who was educated at the london school of economics 
accuses seaga of neglecting basic social services such as health and 
education while more than doubling jamaicas foreign debt to 38 
billion 
no party has won more than two consecutive fiveyear terms in 
jamaica since universal suffrage was introduced in 1944

thirty years ago a titan 1 missile 
roared off a launch pad here on its maiden test flight spawning an 
evolution that soon will see one of its offspring debut as americas 
most powerful unmanned space rocket 
by todays standards that first titan 1 launch on feb 6 1959 
was not much only the first stage was fueled with the second 
stages tanks filled with water for weight and it traveled only 300 
miles down the atlantic tracking range 
but before many months the air force rocket was hurling dummy 
warheads more than 5000 miles at speeds up to 17000 mph 
it was the nations first twostage intercontinental ballistic 
missile and at the time the most powerful delivery system in its 
nuclear arsenal 
we certainly were plowing new ground with a twostage vehicle 
the titan 1 was the giant of our launch vehicle family said gary 
d flora who as a young engineer began working on titans for martin 
marietta in 1960 he now is president of the companys space launch 
systems co in denver 
but the titan 1 was soon obsolete it was replaced by the larger 
more powerful titan 2 which with its storable fuel could sit for 
months in an underground silo ready to be fired at almost a 
moments notice 
fiftyfour titan 2s stood on alert for nearly 20 years in 
165foot silos in arkansas kansas and arizona before the last one 
was deactivated in 1982 the liquidfueled missiles were replaced by 
the minuteman and the submarinelaunched trident missiles with 
advanced technology and easiertohandle solid fuel 
modified titan 2s were used in 1965 and 1966 to hoist 10 pairs of 
gemini astronauts into orbit to rehearse techniques needed to send 
apollo astronauts to the moon 
then using the titan 2 as a basic core martin marietta and the 
air force built a series of titan 3s by improving the rocket motors 
enlarging the fuel tanks and adding solid fuel booster rockets and 
upper stages 
most titan 3s were used by the air force to launch satellites for 
such things as reconnaissance communications and navigation nasa 
added its centaur upper stage to a few of the vehicles to launch the 
helios deep space probe and the voyager and viking payloads to 
explore the planets 
the next generation the titan 4 is on a canaveral launch pad 
ready for its maiden flight within a few weeks with a classified 
military payload 
the new rocket will be able to lift 39000 pounds into low orbit 
or carry 10000 pounds to stationary orbit 23000 miles out where 
communications satellites reside 
the air force has ordered 23 titan 4s from martin marietta and 
negotiations are under way for 26 more the company also is 
modifying 14 of the old titan 2s removed from silos so they can 
serve as mediumsize space boosters the first of these was launched 
successfully with an air force payload last september 
flora said the titan 4 is a very robust blossoming program 
and he expects the rocket will be americas workhorse space rocket 
primarily for military payloads until near the end of the century 
with titan 4 we are pushing into a new generation in terms of 
lift capability said we fields director of canaveral 
operations for martin mariettas space launch systems 
fields said the titan 4 like the titan 3 will grow and become 
even more powerful as improvements are introduced 
and separate teams of contractors headed by martin marietta 
boeing and general dynamics are studying designs for a new rocket 
for the early 21st century capable of lifting 100000 to 200000 
pounds into orbit 
whether that becomes a derivative of titan or not is 
problematical said fields who began working on the titan program 
in 1956

brazilians clad in sequins 
feathers and little else cast aside their economic woes sunday and 
whooped it up at costume balls and street parties during the second 
day of the carnival blowout 
from the southern pampas to the steamy amazon merrymakers packed 
streets to dance to carnival bands or summoned forces for the 
fiveday bash sipping cold beers on street corners or packing 
whitesand beaches nationwide 
carnival formerly linked to roman catholic religious rites is 
now an excuse for a nonstop prelenten party that ends feb 8 ash 
wednesday when banks and shops reopen 
not even 70 percent monthly inflation which has eaten workers 
salaries by about 50 percent in the past year has discouraged 
revelers who sometimes spend as much as 5000 on their glittery 
costumes 
in rio sporadic tropical showers have kept the crowds from the 
beaches but not from the famous balls 
on sunday 60000 samba dancers from the poor mostlyblack 
samba school neighborhood organizations prepared to don skimpy 
rhinestone bikinis and elaborate feather headresses for two days of 
parades 
the parades along a sixblock openair sambadrome feature 
original lyrics costumes and floats based on a carnival theme and 
are considered the highlight of rio carnival 
each year the schools spend millions of dollars on the 
extravagant floats and sumptuous costumes which this year will poke 
fun at vital current social topics such as racism government 
corruption and poverty 
the first eight schools were to dance from sunday night through 
monday morning with a second group parading monday night through 
tuesday morning 
tickets for the event cost as much as 213 but the 12seat avenue 
boxes where tuxedoed waiters serve fine food and drink cost 
12000 or more 
carnival revelers with less to spend were satisfied to beat out 
samba rhythms throughout the day and night along beachfront 
atlantic avenue or attend allnight parties in exclusive nightclubs 
or on street corners 
in coastal salvador 1120 miles northeast of brazil millions of 
costumed revelers packed city squares and streets to dance to 
highlyamplified samba bands perched atop lavishly decorated trucks 
similar festivities occurred in the northeastern coastal cities 
of recife and fortaleza 1500 miles from rio 
but behind the merrymaking authorities are worried the wild 
sexual abandon characteristic of the brazilian event could mean a 
jump in aids cases 
rios gay balls have become a mecca for homosexual tourists 
with almost 5000 registered aids cases brazil is ranked no 3 
in that category worldwide after the united states and france

newspapers sunday said 
president pw botha who stepped down as leader of the ruling party 
last week may retire soon 
botha who suffered a stroke jan 18 resigned thursday as head 
of the national party and was replaced the same day by national 
education minister fw de klerk who is considered bothas heir 
apparent as president 
botha said he will stay on as president but he has appointed 
constitutional development minister chris heunis as acting president 
while he recuperates 
doctors say the 73yearold botha is making a rapid recovery but 
will need at least another month before he can consider returning to 
work 
botha was not present for the opening of parliament in cape town 
on friday and has not been participating in the governments 
daytoday operations officials have said 
the sunday times the countrys largest paper said in a 
frontpage story that bothas decision to step down as party chief 
is a prelude to complete withdrawal from public life 
the newspaper citing unidentified sources within the national 
party said botha may retire within weeks 
the sunday star of johannesburg said in its frontpage story that 
bothas decision to relinquish his party post has sown confusion 
because national party members now owe allegiance to three leaders 
botha de klerk and heunis 
botha has to retire from the presidency soon to solve the 
crisis the newspaper reported also citing unidentified sources 
within the national party 
as president botha still has control over policymaking while 
de klerk will be responsible for the fundamentals of partisan 
politics such as organization and fundraising 
botha has refused to divulge his retirement plans and both 
newspapers said he needs to give a clear indication of his 
intentions 
he deems it unnecessary to offer any clue as to how or how 
long he proposes to wield power the sunday star said in an 
editorial not even de klerk knows how it is all going to work 
the government must call an election before march 1990 and there 
has been widespread speculation it could be held as early as april 
this year

politics is serious business in cajun 
country but lafourche parish sheriff duffy breaux said he didnt 
think it would get so serious that a onetime rival for office would 
try to kill him 
social patterns are strongly influenced in this town 50 miles 
southwest of new orleans by those who work in the dominant 
industries oilfield roughnecks commercial fishermen and farmers 
quick to laugh and quick to anger 
they love good times lsu football and politics 
us attorney john volz says former sheriff cyrus bobby 
tardo 58 twice defeated for office by breaux hired a crew of 
former law officers and their associates to set a pipe bomb that 
almost blew breauxs foot off 10 days before christmas 
tardo also was charged last week with attempted firstdegree 
murder in lafourche parish where a bond of 2 million has been set 
for him 
tardo and his three codefendants have all professed their 
innocents though they have not yet entered pleas 
investigating authorities have declined to speculate on a motive 
but breaux said political revenge may have been involved 
i can only see one thing its a political thing breaux 
said i always defeated him maybe he wanted me out of the way i 
never thought a man would stoop that low 
tardo a former state policeman was elected sheriff in 1971 
breaux defeated him for the sheriffs office in 1975 then won again 
when tardo challenged him in 1979 tardo then ran for parish 
president and won he lost that post to vernon galliano in 1986 
parish is the louisiana term for county 
louis breaux a cousin of the sheriff and a secondterm 
councilman said he cannot believe the charges brought against tardo 
talk to anyone in the parish its hard to believe he was 
pretty much of a loner not much of a good mixer not a hothead at 
all he said friday people take their politics seriously in 
lafourche parish but to try to kill a man thats going pretty far 
out 
us magistrate ronald a fonseca ruled friday that tardo could 
be a danger to society and a potential flight risk if allowed free 
on bond so he ordered him held in federal custody and set a hearing 
for feb 13 
the federal case against tardo is based on testimony of an 
unnamed coconspirator and a transcript of a wiretap in which tardo 
allegedly admitted paying to have the bomb set 
also in federal custody are marshall mcclendon 42 a former new 
orleans policeman and former deputy us marshal ralph bergeron 
42 a former houma policeman and john tullier jr 23 who once 
worked undercover with ascension parish narcotics investigators and 
skipped with 1800 given him to make a cocaine purchase in a sting 
operation tullier later returned and paid back the money 
tardo allegedly paid mcclendon and tullier 8000 with a promise 
of an additional 12000 if breaux died tardo later gave mcclendon 
an additional 2000 and gave 100 to the unnamed informant to help 
him leave town the federal complaints say 
bergeron received 666 for supplying the detonator and the 
technical expertise for the bombing the complaints say 
court records say tullier told an unidentified source in november 
that he and mcclendon were getting paid to blow up sheriff duffy 
mcclendon placed the bomb next to breauxs car and set it off as 
the sheriff nudged it while returning from a christmas party at a 
community center on dec 15 the informant said 
the bomb went off lacing breaux and parttime deputy daniel 
leche with shrapnel nails bullets and pipe fragments breaux 
underwent extensive reconstructive surgery to save his foot 
tardo and the other three were arrested last week on federal 
charges of conspiracy violation of the organized crime control act 
and possession of a destructive device maximum sentences would be 
35 years in prison and 750000 in fines 
the state charges of attempted murder filed against the four men 
carry a maximum penalty of 50 years at hard labor

a senior shiite moslem cleric said the 
amal and hezbollah militias have banned kidnapping of foreigners in 
lebanon the conservative daily alanwar reported sunday 
the newspaper quoted sheik abdel amir kabalan the shiites top 
religious judge as saying the ban was included in a peace pact 
reached by the rival militias in damascus syria last week 
foreigners should have a role in lebanon kabalan was quoted 
as saying 
it is impermissible for anyone from now on to kidnap any 
foreigner because the accord calls for preserving the united 
nations peacekeeping forces and the foreign humanitarian 
organizations he added 
one of the hostages is us marine lt col william r higgins 
who was kidnapped feb 17 1988 while serving as chief of an 
observer group attached to un peacekeeping forces in lebanon 
kabalan who heads amals religious affairs department was a 
member of its delegation to the damascus talks 
the peace accord halted a ninemonth war between the prosyrian 
amal and the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god in which 
more than 500 people were killed 
the two factions were fighting for control of lebanons 1 million 
shiites who make up the countrys largest single sect 
kabalan was quoted as saying the damascus talks did not address 
the issue of the 15 foreigners missing in lebanon 
in fact i havent witnessed any talks about the hostages this 
issue has a separate approach like the one that led to the release 
of the french west german and korean hostages kabalan was quoted 
as saying he did not elaborate 
the hostages are nine americans three britons an irishman an 
italian and a belgian the hostage held longest is terry anderson 
chief middle east correspondent for the associated press he was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 
hezbollah is the umbrella for proiranian extremist groups 
holding most of the hostages 
the islamic jihad or islamic holy war group freed three french 
hostages may 4 reportedly as part of a deal to improve frances 
relations with iran 
two west germans also were freed last year in an apparent effort 
to secure lenient verdicts for shiite brothers mohammed ali and 
abbas hamadi who are held in germany 
abbas hamadi 28 was sentenced in april to 13 years in prison on 
charges of kidnapping the west germans in an attempt to gain the 
freedom of his brother 
mohammed ali 23 is standing trial on charges of air piracy and 
murder in connection with the 1985 twa hijacking in which us navy 
diver robert stetham was killed 
the only south korean hostage held in lebanon was do chaesung 
46 who was second secretary at the south korean embassy in beirut 
when he was kidnapped in 1986 he was freed oct 26 1987 amid 
reports that a hefty ransom was paid 
the south korean government denied making any payment 
kidnappings of foreigners serving with humanitarian organizations 
prompted the international committee of the red cross to shut down 
its operations in lebanon in december

a norwegian un officer has caused an uproar by 
comparing israeli soldiers to nazis because of their expulsion of 
lebanese from villages in israels security zone in south lebanon 
newspapers said sunday 
timor goksel spokesman for the un interim force in lebanon 
confirmed he had received a complaint about language used by lt 
col je karlsen commander of unifils norwegian battalion 
in world war ii my fellow countrymen sacrificed their lives in 
the struggle against the nazis who were trying to expel jews from 
norway nowadays you behave in south lebanon exactly as the nazis 
did karlsen was quoted as saying by the englishlanguage 
jerusalem post 
the post and hebrewlanguage haaretz said karlsen made the remark 
at a meeting thursday with israeli officers over recent 
confrontations between the un forces and israeli troops in south 
lebanon 
haaretz said the israeli army demanded karlsen be removed from 
his post an army official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the army made no such demand but filed a protest goksel said the 
peacekeepers are investigating 
rabbi michael malchior chief rabbi in the norwegian capital 
oslo said on israeli radio that norwegian jews were very angry 
he said the reported remark was part of a growing pattern of 
antijewish behavior 
were hearing of such things more and more not only in 
norway he said its very important to oppose this the jewish 
community will respond in the strongest manner 
israeli soldiers and unifil troops have had several 
confrontations over the deportation of lebanese civilias from 
israels selfdeclared security zone which is patrolled by the 
largely christian militia and israeli soldiers 
at least 70 lebanese were expelled in the past month 
last week lebanon told its un ambassador to lodge a formal 
complaint with the security council stating the expulsions violate 
international law 
in addition israelibacked south lebanon army militiamen and 
israeli soldiers have raided villages in the security zone and 
detained residents suspected of antiisraeli activities goksel said 
israel created the six to 10milewide zone north of its border 
when it withdrew most of its forces from lebanon in 1985 after a 
threeyear occupation

the rightwing party that startled the 
country a week ago by winning 75 percent of the vote in berlin 
elections would garner 115 percent in national balloting according 
to a poll released sunday 
the former nazi ss soldier who heads the republicans responded to 
the poll published by the weekly welt am sonntag by predicting his 
party would win seats in the european parliament 
with this the sensation is perfect republican leader franz 
schoenhuber said with this our entrance into the european 
parliament in june of this year is more than likely 
west germany has 81 representatives in the 518seat parliament 
based in strasbourg france the parliament discusses issues facing 
europe but it has no legal powers 
gains by the republicans threaten further setbacks for chancellor 
helmut kohls centerright governing christian democratic union 
which has lost ground in the last five state elections 
according to welt am sonntag a poll conducted over the past week 
by the wickert institute in tuebingen asked respondents which party 
candidates they would vote for if elections were held the next day 
the wickert institute came to the conclusion that 115 percent 
of voters would choose the republicans the newspaper reported 
party candidates in the berlin legislative elections jan 29 
called for the ouster of foreign workers and asylumseekers many of 
whom are from third world countries 
national elections are not scheduled until 1990 but there are 
several more state contests this year including legislative 
elections in the conservative stronghold of bavaria where 
schoenhubers party enjoys its broadest support 
the newspaper gave few details of the poll and no one answered 
the telephone at the wickert institute on sunday 
welt am sonntag said those polled indicated they knew little of 
the republicans prior to the berlin elections jan 29 but believed 
the ultrarightists had been unfairly criticized by other political 
parties 
in berlin schoenhubers party won 11 of the 138 seats in the 
state legislature and the right to send two representatives to the 
national parliament next year 
the republicans say foreign workers have contributed to high 
unemployment and housing shortages problems nationwide but 
particularly acute in berlin 
the christian democratic union and the opposition social 
democratic party have accused the republicans of stirring up 
nationalist sentiment 
a number of leftist and moderate west germans staged 
demonstrations after the republican victories and accused the 
ultrarightists of espousing neonazi beliefs

six men bowled their hearts out and at the 
end of a 24hour marathon they had felled 79154 pins and perhaps a 
world record set in detroit last year 
the guinness book of world records must still verify the 
accomplishment but unofficially the bowlers broke the record of 
78384 pins set in detrit last year said bob garrett one of the 
bowlers who played without stopping beginning at 3 pm friday 
but the group may never get to lay claim to it 
a group of australian bowlers reportedly rolled a combined 83012 
pins in a day but that record also has not been confirmed by 
guinness garrett said 
garrett craig boehmer bob garrett steve fabi rick ranshaw 
billy wilson and joe faulkner bowled incessantly rolling the balls 
down before the pins were completely set up 
if guinness gives the record to the men this will be the second 
time in a about a year that a world bowling record was set at the 
dover alley 
last february six bowlers broke a previous guinness book of 
world records mark by knocking over 74558 pins in a 24hour period 
garrett and faulkner were among that crew too but four new members 
joined for the latest attempt 
the men averaged 1898 per individual game 13 pins fewer per 
game than the men at dover bowl a year ago 
this was about a hundred times more satisfying than last year 
we werent as good as the bowlers we had last year these guys have 
more heart than anyone else ive ever seen garrett said

a quickthinking railroad engineer 
threw his coal train into reverse and deliberately derailed it 
sunday after his brakes failed on a hill as the train sped into 
town authorities said 
sixtyfour of 66 cars and three locomotives were knocked off the 
track but no major injuries were reported 
he picked a pretty good spot to do it at its not really 
populated in that area the only damage is to train property said 
colorado springs police officer charles pizzitola 
the engineer gl romero of littleton realized he couldnt 
stop so he threw the train into reverse forcing it off the tracks 
at about 8 am pizzitola said romero suffered a minor hip injury 
evidently the engineer lost it at monument hill and knew he 
was out of control pizzitola said when he got down through the 
air force academy they were really going he couldnt brake it down 
he got to a point and remembered something he learned in 
engineer school that said to throw the sucker into reverse and he 
did and everything came apart at that time he said 
the train was going 47 mph when it derailed police said the 
accident occurred in the northern part of town which is largely an 
industrial area police said they were told that each car of the 
train was carrying 100 tons of coal which formed a large mountain 
after the accident 
the train was owned by burlington northern with a santa fe crew 
and the tracks were owned by the rio grande railway the officer 
said 
bill joplin a spokesman for burlington northern said no cause 
of the accident has been determined he said in addition to the 64 
cars that derailed there were three locomotives off the track 
it will take a while to determine the amount of damage because 
each car will have to be examined to determine if it can be used 
again he said

for reappointment in the wake of allegations of public drunkenness 
was found dead sunday an apparent suicide state police said 
superior court judge richard c noren 47 was found inside his 
car in the garage at his woodstock residence sunday morning said a 
state police spokesman 
sgt robert j slattery said that a pipe had been hooked from the

letter asking gov william a oneill to withdraw his nomination for 
reappointment saying he did so with a heavy heart 
on wednesday noren made his last appearance before the 
committee telling lawmakers that he was willing to do anything to 
save the job he said was the honor of a lifetime 
i have often said and not entirely facetiously i would like 
to have on my tombstone the epitaph he was a good judge noren 
told the committee he had been a judge since 1980 
hearings by the legislatures judiciary committee in the past two 
weeks had focused on norens arrest on a drunkendriving charge in 
february 1986 he was placed in an alcohol treatment program for 
first offenders 
two week ago noren told the legislators that he had been sober 
at the time of his arrest three years ago but had refused a breath 
test because he feared his use of a breath freshener would produce a 
false reading in a second hearing last wednesday noren admitted 
that he was drunk but denied that he had lied during the initial 
hearing 
noren then was confronted with a letter sent to committee members 
alleging the judge was seen publicly drunk twice in the past six 
months 
he denied the allegations under oath but rep richard d 
tulisano jucidiary committee cochairman said affidavits would be 
sought from witnesses of the alleged incidents he said if noren had 
lied he could face a perjury charge but that matter was made moot 
by the judges withdrawal thursday

sunday after he was informed of norens death 
jon sandberg the governors press secretary said oneill was 
informed about it this morning and just called it a terrible

president chadli bendjedid has proposed a 
new national constitution that drops references to socialism and 
opens the door to a multiparty system with protections for civil 
liberties 
bendjedids office issued the draft constitution late saturday 
and said it will be submitted to a referendum on feb 23 
this north african arab nation of 25 million people has a 
struggling economy dependent on oil and gas exports in an era of 
sinking prices 
bendjedid 59 has been taking quiet steps for years to move 
algeria away from orthodox socialism toward a freemarket economy 
but has faced determined resistence within the ruling party and the 
government bureaucracy 
the process was accelerated after widespread rioting in october 
officials said 176 people died in several days of fighting 
the proposed document would supersede the 1976 constitution drawn 
up under houari boumedienne president from 196578 boumedienne 
established a marxist system on the soviet model with a politburo 
controlling a ruling party that has a monopoly on political and 
economic power 
under the new constitution the army no longer would be given a 
role in the development of the country and the building of 
socialism its role would be restricted to defending the 
national independence the unity and territorial integrity of the 
country 
islam would remain the state religion and arabic the official 
language of algeria 
the new text recognizes the right to strike within some limits 
and says the right to create associations of a political character 
is recognized but does not explicitly authorize competing 
parties until now the ruling national liberation front has been 
the only legal political organization 
also dropped would be a declaration in the article i of the 
current constitution that the algerian state is socialist the 
presidents oath of office no longer would declare respect for the 
irreversible character of the choice for socialism the new 
document does not even once use the word socialism 
a first round of constitutional reform eliminating the partys 
direct control over the government was approved by 92 percent of 
the voters in a nov 3 referendum 
bendjedid running unopposed as the national liberation front 
candidate was then reelected to a third fiveyear term on dec 22 
the new constitution would guarantee the right to private 
property and to inheritance as well as freedoms of conscience 
opinion expression association assembly and intellectual creation 
a statement issued by the presidents office when the text was 
made public said the new document would provide complete 
unbreakable guarantees of the exercise of individual and collective 
liberties 
in recent months groups and associations have been holding 
rallies making declarations and otherwise pushing the boundaries of 
what previously had been forbidden 
there was no public input into the new draft constitution 
though it was prepared in secret by bendjedids legal experts and 
issued saturday night with no advance warning at the same time a 
voting date was set less than three weeks away 
one of those involved in the drafting speaking on condition of 
anonymity said it was impossible to adopt reforms which reject 
socialism as a political system and simultaneously endorse socialism 
as a state philosophy 
bendjedid himself recently criticized the current constitution as 
a mixture of ideology philosophy and law which must be 
replaced by a state of law concerned exclusively with the relations 
between the state and society

foreign ministers from eight british 
commonwealth nations gathered sunday for a conference to propose 
tougher economic sanctions against whiteled south africa 
the ministers beginning their meeting monday also plan to 
discuss new ways for the 49member commonwealth former components 
of the british empire to bolster poor blackruled states 
threatened by south african destabilization organizers said 
britain is not a member of the committee because of prime 
minister margaret thatchers opposition to sanctions thatcher 
maintains black south africans and neighboring states will suffer 
most from tougher measures against the pretoria government 
canadian external affairs minister joe clark who arrived 
saturday in the zimbabwean capital of harare will chair the third 
threeday meeting of the socalled commonwealth committee of foreign 
ministers on southern africa 
given the location of this meeting and the special 
circumstances of the frontline states the committee has agreed that 
destabilization be the theme of the harare meeting a statement 
from the canadian high commission here said on the eve of the talks 
zimbabwe south africas northern neighbor is one of the six 
frontline states southern africa countries that are in 
confrontation with pretoria over its racial policy of apartheid 
the regional bloc grouping also angola botswana mozambique 
tanzania and zambia spearheads african efforts for more 
international pressure on pretoria 
it also seeks massive aid and investment for the fragile 
economies of its members to counter south african economic and 
military retaliation most frontliners are heavily dependent on 
south africa economic powerhouse of the region for trade and for 
transport links with the outside world 
britain japan the united states and west germany are frequently 
singled out by the frontline states for ignoring calls for tougher 
sanctions but the commonwealth has little real muscle in 
confronting south africa without mrs thatchers support 
the southern africa committee was formed by the 26th commonwealth 
summit in vancouver canada in 1987 to monitor sanctions and 
propose ways of tightening the economic blockade against south 
africa to force that country to abandon its apartheid system the 
committee met twice last year in the zambian capital of lusaka and 
in toronto canada 
under apartheid south africas 5 million whites virtually 
control the economy and government and live mainly apart from the 26 
million blacks who have no vote in national affairs

leaders of the afghan resistance based in 
iran and pakistan on sunday signed a pact to cooperate in a new 
government in afghanistan foreign minister ali akbar velayati said 
velayati told the associated press the accord was signed in 
tehran after a lot of effort during a meeting he held with two 
leaders of the guerrillas who call themselves mujahedeen or holy 
warriors 
they finally signed an agreement for cooperation about a future 
government for afghanistan velayati said 
he gave no details of the accord which could boost the 
guerillas chances of succeeding the communist regime in kabul after 
the soviet army leaves the country the red army is supposed to be 
out by feb 15 
the mujahedeen are split into two groups the minority shiite 
moslem alliance based in iran and the larger pakistanbased sunni 
coalition the pakistanbased guerrilla leader sibghatullah 
mojaddidi signed the cooperation and friendship pact with mohammad 
karim khalili spokesman for the iranbased alliance 
the official islamic republic news agency said it was believed 
the two groups agreed on the number of seats to be offered to shiite 
representatives in the 480member shura assembly 
the shura is a form of moslem parliament expected to meet next 
month to appont an interim government for afghanistan following the 
soviet pullout 
the quarrelsome mujahedeen coalitions bickered for weeks over the 
proportional division of assembly seats 
mojaddidi later returned to islamabad pakistan where guerrilla 
sources said soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze would meet 
guerrilla leaders monday 
tehran radio reported that visiting soviet deputy foreign 
minister yuli vorontsov held talks with velayati on sunday that 
stressed the importance of a peaceful transfer of power after the 
soviets withdraw 
all sides involved agree on the need for a settlement that will 
produce a broadbased government to succeed the ruling peoples 
democratic party which seized power in a bloody 1978 coup 
but the partys marxist leader president najib insists such a 
government must retain some of his officials 
the mujahedeen consider the communists traitors for requesting 
soviet military intervention in december 1979 and refuse to deal 
with them 
there are no immediate prospects for peace between the kabul 
government and the guerrillas armed by the united states pakistan 
and other islamic countries

almost all the guests on abcs nightline 
news program are white males representing a conservative viewpoint 
according to a study of the acclaimed latenight program 
commissioned by a liberal media watchdog group 
the survey of nearly 2500 guests on more than 850 nightline 
episodes also concluded that the interview program largely ignores 
organized labor consumer and environmental advocates peace 
activists the working class and americans who oppose the nations 
foreign policy 
the show sees itself as very much locked in with what the state 
does what the government does said jeff cohen executive 
director of fairness amp accuracy in reporting the organization that 
commissioned the study but national coverage is much more than 
what the white house or even congress did today 
the winner of two dozen emmys and every major award in broadcast 
journalism nightline is perceived nationally as one of 
televisions most influential news programs it is seen by more than 
5 million viewers nightly 
ted koppel the host of nightline for all of its nine years 
criticized the report in a telephone interview 
never is it even suggested that if you want to critique us 
foreign policy you dont bring on the opponents of us foreign 
policy and let them speak their minds koppel said what you do 
is bring on the architects of us foreign policy and hold them to 
account which is what we try to do on this broadcast 
nightline executive producer richard kaplan said he had 
major problems with the study but it sensitizes us again 
to broadening the scope of guests 
in examining 40 months of nightline episodes from january 
1985 to april 1988 boston college sociologists william hoynes and 
david croteau found that 89 percent of the programs us guests 
were male and that 92 percent of them were white 
the shows most frequent guests according to the study are all 
conservative leaders former secretaries of state henry kissinger 
and alexander haig each made 14 appearances and former assistant 
secretary of state for interamerican affairs elliott abrams and 
television evangelist jerry falwell each made 12 appearances 
the study which did not analyze nightlines pretaped news 
summaries also said that representatives of liberal civic or public 
interest groups were often overlooked and that stories on economic 
class racial gender and cultural issues received short shrift 
plainly stated nightline presents a picture of the world 
which is startlingly similar to that presented by the us 
government the study concluded 
but kaplan said the show never has purported to cover all points 
of view they just dont understand that we are not the opinion 
page of a newspaper we are news we cover whats in the news 
koppel said the show is guilty of putting on the 
establishment 
that is what we do in point of fact it is our function we 
believe to try to get the opinions of those who actually make the 
decisions form the policy and lead the government

the welsh national opera brought a freshfaced 
yet traditional production of verdis falstaff to the brooklyn 
academy of music for its american debut 
the orchestra conducted by richard armstrong sounded 
firstrate as did the onstage french horn player and the cast of 
the production directed by west germanys peter stein contains 
young fresh voices 
particularly enjoyable were donald maxwell whose robust voice 
made falstaff sound younger then weve ever heard suzanne murphy as 
mistress ford nuccia focile as nannetta her daughter and laurence 
dale who loves nannetta 
the princess of wales attended the first of four performances on 
thursday reviewers attended saturday night 
realism winds is way through the staging when the laundry basket 
in which falstaff hides is dumped out a window into a ditch he can 
be seen still in it unlike some stagings that let him exit through 
a trapdoor first 
later falstaff opens his shirt to reveal what looks like fat 
not pillows 
settings are sparse and everything is used mistress ford sits 
on her only chair and plays a lute with fluffy clouds behind her 
nanette reclines on the sill of the picture window through which 
falstaff is later dumped 
orange and black planks form the interior walls of the ford house 
and the wall outside the tavern the same colors in mistress ford 
and nannettas dresses when fords men create havoc searching for 
falstaff they tear strips off the wall 
in the tavern falstaff upends a table and in a humorous touch 
takes out chalk and uses it as a blackboard stein has wisely 
refrained from stuffing falstaff with visual jokes 
the stage is made small giving the opera intimacy and projecting 
voices 
the tavern interior is shallow and the ford living room not much 
deeper only the windsor park scene uses the full width of the 
stage even that has cast and chorus milling around nicely never 
static on a center raked platform for the finale

the case of colorados frontier cannibal alferd e 
packer may be literally dug up again as a group of scientists plans 
to exhume skeletal remains of his five companions this summer to 
find out how they died 
packer admitted living off the flesh of these men for nearly 
60 days while snowbound in the colorado mountains near lake city in 
the winter of 1874 but packer insisted that he killed only one of 
them shannon wilson bell and that it was in selfdefense 
the only solid evidence of what happened to the others was 
contained in the multiple and contradictory statements of packer 
himself said james starrs a professor of law and forensic 
science at george washington university in washington dc 
we want to establish if we can what actually happened when 
these people died starrs said in an interview published sunday in 
the denver post 
to date starrs said interest in the packer case has been 
limited to jokes about cannibalism it is the theme for an annual 
spring bash at the university of colorado at boulder 
but starrs said the case is significant because packer was the 
only person prosecuted in the united states for cannibalism 
packer was first convicted of killing his companions but he 
appealed his hanging sentence won a new trial and was convicted of 
five counts of manslaughter 
he was sentenced to 40 years after 17 years he was paroled in 
1901 and lived out his years in sheridan now a denver suburb he 
died in april 1907 at age 65 
in one confession packer said two of his colleagues froze or 
starved to death and were eaten by the group a third died 
accidentally a fourth was killed by bell and packer then 
killed bell in selfdefense 
in a later confession packer said he returned to the camp in

patricio aylwin a former senator who led 
the oppositions victory over president augusto pinochet in last 
years referendum was chosen sunday as the presidential candidate 
of the christian democratic party 
the nominaton by the leading opposition party is likely to be 
followed by an endorsement from the rest of the antipinochet 
coalition progovernment forces also are expected to pick a 
candidate for the dec 14 election 
i trust my name will be accepted by the other parties in the 
17party opposition coalition aylwin said after his unanimous 
nomination by the christian democrats 286delegate convention 
i hope we will be able to reach an agreement on a single 
opposition candidate said alywin 70 thats what all the 
parties in the opposition want 
the 10hour christian democratic gathering at the town of 
talagante 20 miles southwest of santiago ended at dawn sunday with 
alywins nomination 
the nomination was unanimous party officials said after at 
least two other contenders withdrew from the race 
the nomination was expected to restore unity within the 
opposition coalition which was badly split in the last three months 
over the choice of the presidential candidate 
the opposition coalition is to meet next month to decide on a 
single presidential candidate 
leaders from virtully all parties in the coalition which ranges 
from the centerright to the left had said before the convention 
that they wwere prepared to support aylwin if he was nominated by 
the christian democrats 
the former senator has been criticized however by some leftist 
politicians who say he did not oppose pinochets 1973 coup that 
toppled the elected leftist government of president salvador allende 
allende died in the coup taking his own life according to the 
militarys version which is now widely accepted 
aylwin emerged as a leading national political figure as chief 
spokesman for the united opposition during the campaign for last 
oct 5 referendum in which voters rejected a military proposal to 
extend pinochets term until 1997 the opposition received 39 
million votes to pinochets 31 million 
the referendum outcome made the dec 14 open presidential 
election mandatory pinochet is barred by the constitution to seek 
reelection but the constution still guarantees a prominent role 
for the military in running the country 
aylwin considered a moderate has said the future governments 
priority tasks include the trial and punishment of those responsible 
for the massive human rights violations that occurred under the 
military government 
aylwin a law professsor is a seasoned politician who was 
president of the senate before the 1973 coup

compton police announced saturday the arrest of an 18yearold

house democrats tried to buck 
up their courage sunday as they wrapped up a weekend retreat and 
looked toward capitol hill battles over a proposed 51 percent pay 
raise 
when we face reelection in 22 months no one will be defeated 
because of that issue rep beryl anthony dark chairman of the 
house democratic campaign committee told his colleagues when you 
address the issue headup the people will understand it we will 
survive 
rep steny hoyer dmd appearing on cbs face the nation 
reminded the television audience four times that it was president 
reagan who proposed raising congressional salaries from 89500 to 
135000 and that president bush endorsed it 
however hoyer said house speaker jim wright is confronted with 
an environment atmosphere of a great deal of hypocrisy very 
frankly as well as hysteria and demagoguery any time a pay raise 
is before the congress theres a great deal of indignation and its 
hard for the congress to deal with that issue 
at their weekend conference at the luxurious greenbrier resort 
members tried to bowl swim ride shoot skate drink dance talk 
eat jog putt swing and pray their blues away 
but many rankandfile lawmakers said that while it was a great 
family outing it did not alleviate their dread of the looming pay 
battle 
we got the news this weekend that weve got an appointment for 
a root canal every day this week said rep dick durbin dill 
who was among those hoping wright would find a way to dispose of the 
pay raise issue 
i would like this execution to be swift i dont want to bleed 
to death durbin said adding that 75 percent of his constituents 
said in a survey they would consider the pay raise a major issue in 
the next election 
on face the nation sen gordon humphrey rnh said 
this pay raise is an affront to the american people both with 
respect to the amount and in particular the method by which 
congress is going about trying to get this without ever having to 
record a vote or hold itself accountable to the american people 
under the law the pay raise goes into effect for members of 
congress federal judges and top executive branch officials on 
wednesday unless both chambers of congress have voted it down the 
senate did so 955 last thursday leaving the final decision with 
the house 
wright said last week he would not schedule any vote until after 
the pay was increased but then would have the house vote on 
reducing the pay increase to 30 percent 
that increase would be equal to the amount of current pay plus 
outside income from speaking fees and other honoraria that members 
now may keep but would be banned in the future under wrights plan 
wright said sunday he cannot guarantee that well be seen or 
judged in the right light perhaps i can help us to act in the right 
light with dignity and honor and selfrespect 
there was no groundswell of support for the 30 percent solution 
among the democrats at the greenbrier a top leadership source said 
there had been new discussions on whether to just kill the pay 
raise but the speakers strategy had not changed 
many lawmakers both democrats and republicans had preferred 
the original leadership strategy accepting the pay boost and 
avoiding any votes wrights plan which if approved would have to 
be negotiated with the senate was seen as potentially dragging the 
issue out for months 
some also worried they could lose both their pay raise and 
honoraria income others disliked waiting until after the deadline 
for the rollback since federal judges would get to keep the whole 
amount under a constitutional provision prohibiting their pay from 
ever being reduced 
theres a feeling that if were all going to hang were going 
to hang together said rep leon panetta dcalif 
back in washington opponents of the pay raise planned monday to 
attempt to force embarrassing procedural votes on the house floor 
in an effort to force wright to allow a predeadline roll call on 
the issue numerous surveys have indicated that if put to a vote 
the pay raise would be defeated 
rep john lafalce dny said he wasnt concerned about further 
political fallout because of those insurgents 
the issue already has embarrassed congress about as much as we 
can be embarrassed he said

us supreme court justice anthony m kennedy 
called upon the nations lawyers sunday to stand up for the rule 
of law against forces that he said threaten to corrode american 
society 
its important that the lawyers of this country understand the 
corrosive effect when the law is disobeyed kennedy said in a 
speech to the american bar association im concerned that time is 
running out you must understand the assault on the rule of law in 
philosophical terms 
kennedy making his first speech to the aba since taking his seat 
on the high court a year ago did not offer specific examples of a 
breakdown in law and order 
but he said he is concerned by those who use poverty as a 
justification for lawbreaking 
the rule of law is the only sure way to preserve human 
dignity he said we have a legitimate legal and moral right to 
enforce the criminal law 
kennedy who taught constitutional law at mcgeorge school of law 
in california for 23 years devoted much of his speech to an 
examination of the historical and theoretical underpinnings of the 
us legal system 
he said that system is founded on the consent of the governed and 
survives because of its guarantee of individual rights 
among those rights is that of holding property kennedy said i 
know of no society that has protected human rights without 
protecting property rights he said 
he also denounced the theory of the class struggle that is at the 
heart of communism 
leninism the class struggle is absolutely antithetical to the 
rule of law kennedy said 
two other members of the supreme court are attending the abas 
midwinter convention here 
chief justice william h rehnquist planned to address the abas 
house of delegates on monday the group is the policymaking body 
for the association the nations largest organization of lawyers 
justice byron r white a native of colorado was presented with 
a portrait sunday by the colorado and denver bar associations 
the house of delegates convenes monday to consider several 
controversial porposals including an endorsement of gay rights 
legislation 
the proposal would urge enactment of laws to prohibit 
discrimination based on sexual orientation a similar proposal was 
defeated narrowly by the delegates in 1985 
the group also plans to vote on a package of proposals affecting 
the insurance industry the key provision would endorse federal 
regulation of the industry and repeal a 1945 law granting the 
industry broad exemption from federal antitrust violations

invaders of the holy land

locked themselves into two empty arabowned buildings they claim are 
used to stage firebomb attacks on israelis 
in a nationally televised speech to his rightwing likud shamir 
vowed 
there will be no palestinian state here never 
israel was linked to only one people the jews he said 
aliens terrorists plo men and others are recalled in that 
context today but they are brutal wild alien invaders in the land 
of israel that belongs to the people of israel and only to them

the 14month uprising against israeli occupation of the west bank 
and gaza strip fifteen israelis have died 
in gaza soldiers opened fire in three other refugee camps and a 
village wounding 19 palestinians hospital officials said four

fidel castro on sunday defended his 
30year rule and said cuba is ready to return to latin american 
political sphere 
culminating four days of effusive demonstrations of warmth and 
support from venezuelans who flocked to glimpse him wherever he 
appeared castro spoke to a packed auditorium of journalists 
i think my visit to caracas for the first time in 30 years 
shows that cuba is ready and latin america is ready for our 
reintegration said castro 
he visited venezuela last in 1959 shortly after he seized power 
relations between the countries quickly were strained when castro 
supported guerrillas trying to topple venezuelas elected government 
in the 1960s and early 1970s 
castro did not mention this support all questions were submitted 
beforehand and castro did not answer them all 
he repeated his position that cuba if invited would join the 
organization of american states 
he said his visit to caracas for the inauguration of carlos 
andres perez as venezuelas president along with visits to peru and 
mexico for similar inaugurals last year shows cuba is being 
accepted back into latin american circles 
before i never got invited now i get invited castro said 
he defended his length of time in power the longest of any latin 
american dictator saying he has less power inside cuba then other 
world leaders in their own countries 
if you want to measure power a us president can start a 
nuclear war without asking anybody said castro 
he attacked the united states for its role in latin america but 
praised the state department for describing as worth studying a 
recent proposal by el salvadoran guerrillas to lay down their 
weapons in exchange for a role in general elections 
its a sign of a better political will in the new bush 
administration said castro

iranian president ali khamenei conferred 
sunday with french foreign minister roland dumas the first visit to 
tehran by a senior french official since the islamic revolt a decade 
ago tehran radio reported 
the radio monitored in nicosia quoted dumas as sayingi have 
come to tehran in hopes of improving relations between our two 
countries to a desirable level 
khamenei confirmed the possibility of establishing good strong 
relations rooted in the historical ties between the two countries 
but newspaper and radio commentaries blasted french foreign 
policy pointing out that after the soviet union france was iraqs 
second most important arms supplier 
the official islamic republic news agency also monitored in 
nicosia said dumas also met with parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani believed to be the architect of irans new opendoor 
policy 
rafsanjani said that good ties between tehran and paris were 
possible adding that frances adoption of just stands at 
international forums could be effective in furthering bilateral 
ties the iranian news agency said 
dumas is due in geneva tuesday to address the opening session of 
the 40nation disarmament conference which is negotiating a 
comprehensive ban on chemical weapons 
the islamic republic news agency said earlier that dumas and his 
60member delegation were met by iranian foreign minister ali akbar 
velayati on arrival at mehrabad airport

reconstruction projects after the aug 20 ceasefire that halted its 
devastating war with neighboring iraq 
also on the agenda is a longrunning dispute over a 1 billion 
loan made by the late shah mohammed reza pahlavi before the 
overthrow of the monarchy in 1979 
iran has demanded that france repay the loan plus interest 
amounting to an additional 1 billion france has agreed to pay the 
initial amount in installments but not the interest 
french relations with iran faltered after the overthrow of the 
prowestern monarchy diplomatic ties were severed in july 1987 
after a police siege of the iranian embassy in paris where a 
translator wanted for questioning in connection with terrorist 
bombings had taken refuge 
relations were restored 11 months later after the translator 
wahid gordji appeared for a brief interrogation and proiranian 
extremists freed french hostages held in lebanon

industrial output fell nearly 11 percent in 
january from one month earlier in the sharpest drop since the 
government began its austerity drive last fall an official report 
said sunday 
however the drop was concentrated in areas where critical 
shortages already exist energy steel and raw materials as well 
as daily commodities such as cotton the xinhua news agency said 
this will pose a threat to industrial development in the next 
few months it said many factories already are forced to shut 
down two to four days a week because of shortages of energy and raw 
materials such as steel items whose production the government wants 
expanded 
production of color televisions refrigerators and other 
household appliances was up the report said but gave no figures 
xinhua said industrial output totaled 26 billion in january 
down 109 percent from december but up 82 percent from january 
1988 the government has said it wants to cut industrial growth to 
about 10 percent this year down from 177 percent for all of 1988 
the government has blamed the rapid growth of the past few years 
for inflation that economists privately peg at about 40 percent 
officials said prices rose 185 percent in 1988 but also said in 
october that the price index was up 26 percent over the previous 
october 
as the spiraling prices triggered public discontent authorities 
ordered cuts in september in bank loans capital construction and 
local government spending as antiinflation moves 
they also tried to control in the mushroomlike growth of small 
rural factories which now number more than 15 million they have 
both siphoned raw materials and energy away from larger staterun 
factories and put the staterun factories to shame with their 
greater productivity 
but local authorities have tried to shield their lucrative 
factories from the impact of the new tightmoney policy and xinhua 
said rural industry actually increased output by 25 percent in 
january over december 
it said rural factories accounted for oneeighth of januarys 
total industrial output stateowned factories increased output by 
an average of 37 percent xinhua said 
as the austerity policies begin to take effect some economists 
have worried that they will result in stagnant economic growth plus 
inflation experienced in many western countries in the 1970s

they couldnt see the gaudy floats in the 
mardi gras parade or the plastic beads and aluminum doubloons flung 
toward them sunday but the group from the louisiana center for the 
blind had a blast 
its a lot of fun time just to cut loose and anything goes 
said ernestine morais of central calif 
the 15 adult students and seven staff members two sighted who 
drove the vans were only a few of the thousands who lined parade 
routes in cold gray weather to see the 11 parades rolling through 
metropolitian new orleans on sunday 
the parades included the popular bacchus which named comedian 
billy crystal as this years god of wine and revelry he threw 
double handfuls of doubloons at the sea of arms below him stopping 
only to pull out a camera to make home videos of the crowd 
there was a serious purpose to the schools trip said centers 
director joanne fernandez that was helping students learn to 
navigate through crowds she said 
this is one of our biggest confidence builders fernandez 
said mardi gras is the ultimate if you can travel through a 
mardi gras crowd you can go through any crowd and you can go to any 
place 
it was cloudy and drizzling sunday with temperatures in the 40s 
near freezing temperatures were predicted overnight getting a 
little colder monday and fat tuesday said the national weather 
service 
paradewatchers bundled up but enjoyed themselves sometimes 
people in the blind group would take off their heavy gloves to 
search for a string of beads or other parade baubles 
the group had staked out a spot right behind the police 
barricades on the streets median like the sighted people around 
them they were grabbing for the plastic beads doubloons and other 
trinkets 
this is the kind of souvenir shopping i can afford said ms 
morais 
when a doubloon clanged on the street in front of the barricade 
long white canes poked out toward it sweeping the street until one 
touched the coin and pulled it in beads hit the ground and several 
people quickly knelt their hands sweeping around until one person 
called out i have it 
some sighted people in the crowd took their own beads and tossed 
them into the little group others reached through the groping hands 
to grab beads for themselves 
the crowd surged into the french quarter between parades ready 
to rock on bourbon street 
one rider in an afternoon parade was injured and knocked 
unconscious for several minutes when he fell from a float and hit 
his head and shoulder said police spokesman john bryson it was the 
weekends second paraderelated injury 
new orleans police estimated this will be the biggest mardi gras 
ever with 17 million revelers lining the streets and jamming the 
french quarter on fat tuesday the last blowout before the solemn 
season of lent authorities said 15 million people attended the

police shut down the largest exhibition of 
avantgarde art in communist chinas history on sunday the day it 
opened after artists defied a ban on performance art and a man shot 
a sculpture with a bb gun 
fei dawei an exhibition organizer said the show would most 
likely reopen on friday they are just punishing us for the 
trouble we caused he said 
as police closed the show shortly before noon on sunday hundreds 
of spectators and artists spilled into the courtyard in front of the 
china art gallery 
at one point two carloads of riot police wearing helmets and 
toting automatic weapons and tear gas canisters drove into the 
crowd they left immediately after their cars were surrounded by 
curious onlookers 
that must be performance art too said one artist 
several artists accused the public security bureau of using the 
shooting incident as an excuse to shut the exhibition which was 
approved by the government after three years of debate 
we have given them all the justification they need to shut us 
down said su liqin an artist in the show this is a sad day 
for art in china 
police refused to respond to the charges 
the show has been closed because of problems said a police 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity other than that we 
have no comment he said to come back tuesday the next day the 
gallery is scheduled to be open to see what happens 
the exhibit of more than 250 works covering three floors of the 
gallery included sculpture penandink drawing video art and oil 
painting artists came from all over china 
the show began on a somber note in the center of the gallerys 
main hall organizers had constructed a black coffin on top of 
which was written this exhibition is in honor of all the chinese 
artists who gave their lives for modern art 
but the show soon took on a defiant tone as artists began to 
break a ban on performance art 
in one corner a man with shoulderlength hair whipped out boxes 
of frozen shrimp and began doing a quick business museum officials 
told him to stop 
wu shanzhuan said he was selling his goods to protest the 
commercialization of art in china 
then three individuals wrapped from head to toe in white cloth 
entered the hall bumping into spectators 
this is arts lot in china said one its tied up 
museum officials ordered them to leave 
another artist began tossing handfuls of condoms and money on the 
floor as viewers gaped in disbelief 
wang deren said he just wanted to help chinas family planning 
program he appeared to be joking 
police told wang to pick up the condoms and leave 
the last performance came shortly before noon when a man and a 
woman entered the first floor hall and stood in front of the womans 
sculpture a phone booth 
exhibition officials initially said the woman xiao lu an artist 
from hangzhou shot her work of art 
but fei said police have determined that her boyfriend tang 
song actually fired two bbs into the work police detained tang at 
the show and found ms xiao later 
what we know now is that they walked into the gallery she 
handed him the gun and he shot her artwork he said it was a 
performance art piece together they were attempting to negate 
modern civilization 
for decades art in china was strictly controlled by the state 
and works that did not serve the interests of the communist party 
were not welcome recently some cracks in chinas cultural monolith 
have appeared 
last month two nude exhibitions were held at the china art 
gallery after years of being banned by the puritanical party 
smaller galleries are showing experimental art 
organizers said modern artists who have held small individual 
shows have been trying to hold a large exhibition in china since 
1985 but have been held up by conservative bureaucrats 
they said this exhibition originally scheduled to last until 
feb 19 was given the goahead only after organizers raised all the 
money themselves 
even then several of the works were censored or altered before 
the show began 
one work based on leonardo da vincis the last supper with 
mao tsetung as jesus christ was banned

the national rifle association invited 
stockton officials to a shooting match sunday in a lastditch effort 
to stop a local ban on semiautomatic assault rifles 
organizers of the target shooting competition hoped to show that 
assault rifles such as the ak47 rifle used in the jan 17 stockton 
school massacre have legitimate sporting uses said jp nelson an 
nra field representative 
the twicemonthly contest was scheduled before gunman patrick 
purdy used the ak47 rifle to kill five children and injure 30 
others at cleveland elementary school before killing himself with a 
handgun nelson said 
sixtynine people competed in the match at the san joaquin rifle 
amp pistol range located 12 miles east of stockton guns used at the 
contest included ar15 m1 and ak47 rifles 
only one stockton school official accepted the invitation and 
showed up to watch the target shooting nelson said 
he didnt sound like one of our better friends nelson said 
the stockton city council is expected to ban sales of 
semiautomatic weapons within city limits on monday 
several state legislators also have proposed statewide 
restrictions following the stockton school shooting and an increase 
in driveby shootings by gangs armed with semiautomatic firearms 
such restrictions would only affect lawabiding gun owners not 
criminals nelson said 
youre not going to be able to legislate crazy people sane

in the early 1980s goldome bankers looked 
out their windows and saw a dismal panorama of urban decay 
a seedy collection of bars peep shows and drug paraphernalia 
shops dotted buffalos largely dilapidated and abandoned downtown 
goldomes 55 million 12story glass tower was one of the few 
symbols of hope in an old industrial city ravaged by plant closings 
today there is a shiny subwaytrolley system that stops near 
goldome and unloads smartly dressed couples catching dinner before a 
show in the theater district or at the new cinema arcade which 
features 12 films 
now when the executives look outside they see new offices busy 
stores and lots of people but inside goldomes office there is a 
company almost as down on its luck as the city was a few years ago 
after a quick rise from local savings bank to 15 billion 
financial services company with operations in two dozen states 
goldome has faltered and lost more than 56 million in the first 
three quarters of 1988 partly as a result of troubled thrifts it 
acquired in years past 
goldome is expected to release 1988 fourth quarter and yearend 
results this week and analysts predict more red ink 
the companys stock has dropped from the 7 per share offering 
price when it went public in 1987 to 225 this past week 
adding insult to injury fortune magazine recently named goldome 
as the seventh leastadmired company in america goldome ranked 
300th out of 305 companies as a longterm investment and 289th in 
community responsibility 
the latter ranking especially stung goldome officials who point 
out that chairman ross b kenzie was a key player in downtown 
redevelopment and someone who consistently urged buffalo residents 
not to lose confidence in their city 
the company now seems to be in the same position the city once 
was in desperate need of someone to believe in its future 
its no secret weve had losses but weve also taken steps to 
turn the company around said company spokesman marc chodorow 
the publics perception just hasnt kept pace with what weve been 
doing 
goldome has cut 20 million from its budget by a 10 percent 
workforce reduction and by shrinking executive benefits 
the company has sold 11 new york city branches with 12 billion 
in deposits to manufacturers hanover corp for 65 million 
it also has begun a thorough evaluation of its business and urged 
employees to offer new ideas to raise money chodorow said 
not all those ideas have been wellreceived however attorneys 
general in ohio pennsylvania and west virginia raised questions 
about goldome attempts to drum up business by selling certificates 
of deposit in department stores 
the company suspended sales briefly and was required to make 
modifications chodorow said the practice is successful 
although the company has made some progress analysts say it is 
still wrangling with its underlying problem the unprofitable 
banking subsidiaries it acquired during the early 1980s 
goldome wasnt the only banking concern that grew by acquiring 
others at the time federal regulators were only too happy to have 
healthy banks take over troubled operations in the savings amp loan 
industry the problem was few people gave much thought to the 
longterm viability of combined businesses 
the assets of the troubled thrifts consisted of fixed mortgages 
with low interest rates their liabilities were shortterm deposits 
paying high interest rates when interest rates began to rise in the 
spring of 1987 goldomes expenses surged and profits disappeared 
in addition many of the investments its acquisitions had made in 
commercial real estate went bad leaving the company stuck with 
repossessed property worth less than the value of the loans 
although chodorow said goldome is making progress in turning 
around its overall business industry analysts say the company will 
have to make other major steps soon to return to profitability 
roger powell an analyst for alex brown amp sons inc in 
baltimore says goldome needs to take dramatic action like 
selling off more bank operations

an fbi agent posing as a losing trader drew 
commodities brokers into a federal investigation of their activities 
by offering to help them dodge taxes on their earnings in the 
futures markets one broker said in an interview published sunday 
he made this pitch repeatedly thomas a crouch a prominent 
broker told the chicago tribune 
hed say i have this big loss carryover and im willing to 
sell it to guys whove made a lot of money crouch said 
crouch was the first broker to detail in a news account how be 
became a subject of the massive probe of alleged commodities fraud 
at the chicago board of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange 
the agent who used the alias peter vogel posed as a 
downonhisluck trader willing to use his accounts to conceal the 
profits of successful traders who wanted to evade taxes crouch said 
at least one trader went along with vogels scheme because he 
felt sorry for him said crouch of ogden dunes ind 
the fbis investigation has centered on allegations that as many 
as 100 brokers and traders at chicagos futures exchanges 
systematically cheated customers out of millions of dollars in 
executing their orders to buy and sell futures contracts on a 
variety of commodities 
a federal grand jury reportedly has been convened to consider the 
fraud charges more than 200 subpoenas have been served on prominent 
brokers traders and firms 
crouch said he traded futures contracts on japanese yen with 
vogel described by crouch and others as a cleancut silverhaired 
hayseed vogel was introduced around the merc as the nephew of a 
south american millionaire with an interest in commodities the 
broker said 
sources close to the inquiry told the tribune vogel would suggest 
to traders they secretly park their earnings in his account by 
recording their trades in his name or that they could concoct 
trades with him that showed them losing money 
crouch said he didnt go along with it but did seek colleagues 
to participate 
i heard the spiel crouch said i was dumb enough to say 
i dont want to do this but ill see who does 
some traders have described as particularly unsuccessful in the 
futures market 
crouchs comments provided the first look from a traders 
perspective at the investigation that has shaken the industry since 
it was disclosed last month 
the tribune said crouch decided to be interviewed because he 
believed he and his colleagues were betrayed by vogel some were 
particularly upset that vogel used an office christmas party in the 
final weeks of the investigation to catch people offguard and 
possibly record their conversations on tape crouch said 
to accept an invitation and then work the party is just a bit 
much crouch said 
this wasnt miami vice this wasnt a cocaine ring the 
newspaper quoed crouch as saying this at best was a little 
whitecollar crime 
the tribune said vogel was one of four federal agents who posed 
as traders to record thousands of potentially incriminating 
conversations in restaurants downtown apartments and the noisy pits 
of the worlds largest futures exchanges 
one agent worked as vogels partner another worked in the board 
of trades soybean pit and another traded treasury bonds at the 
merc the tribune said

opec produced nearly 197 million barrels a day 
of oil in january more than 1 million barrels over the amount 
promised under the cartels new quota system according to a report 
released sunday 
the petroleum intelligence weekly said its latest survey of world 
oil production showed that at least five members of the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries exceeded their quotas last month 
pushing production beyond the 185 million barrels pledged at a 
meeting last november 
the new quota was to have taken effect jan 1 and extend for six 
months in an effort to stabilize world prices which slumped to near 
1986 lows last year because of a massive oversupply of oil 
the united arab emirates was said to be the biggest offender but 
other major exporters also overproduced including saudi arabia 
kuwait iran and qatar the survey found 
the uae whose quota was set at 988000 barrels a day produced 
approximately 15 million barrels the piw said 
however iranian output at about 27 million barrels a day 
could have important ramifications since some in opec had thought 
tehran would only produce about 25 million barrels 150000 
barrels under its quota thereby offsetting the impact of uae 
excesses the report said 
last year opec production averaged 196 million barrels a day 
according to the piw an 11 percent rise from 1987 and the highest 
level since 1982 exceeding the 1986 average of 184 million barrels 
a day 
between january and december 1988 opec production soared more 
than 5 million barrels from 173 million to 227 million while 
nonopec production remained flat the survey showed 
the report also indicated fourthqyarter demand for oil by 
consuming nations including the united states was due in part to 
temporary factors such as weather and might not continue as strong 
in 1989
