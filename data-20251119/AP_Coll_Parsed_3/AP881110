the us embassy in moscow has been forced to 
suspend at least until january the processing of applications of 
soviet refugees the state department said thursday 
in a sense the reagan administration is a victim of its own 
policy 
having insisted that the soviet union allow people to leave the 
embassy now finds that the flood of about 100 applications a day is 
exceeding financial and quota limits 
most of the refugees are armenians although a few are jews 
in another category the level of jews allowed to leave for 
israel is now so high there may be a slowdown in processing those 
who apply in rome or vienna to go to the united states instead said 
state department spokesman charles e redman 
redman called the soviet response to us emigration demands a 
welcome development but he said it meant the us embassy in 
moscow processed six times as many refugees from the soviet union in 
fiscal year 1988 which ended sept 30 as in the previous year 
a total of 16500 soviet refugees and immigrants are permitted to 
enter the united states each year 4000 directly as refugees and 
12500 via rome and vienna 
among the refugees redman said there is a backlog of 1700 
cases causing us immigration officials to halt further interviews 
at least until january 
in view of the situation the spokesman said the embassy 
is urging applicants not to make an irrevocable commitment or to cut 
their ties to the soviet union 
at present redman said 1500 applicants have been cleared and 
will leave for the united states once they obtain airline tickets 
the second category of immigrants facing a squeeze are jews who 
go to rome or vienna with permits for israel and then ask for 
admission to the united states 
there were 2400 applications in october the us official said 
and at this rate it may result in delays of processing as well 
while most of the immigrants who exit through rome and vienna are 
jews redman said a small percentage are not but all of them have 
exit permits as jews for israel 
this years quota is squeezed by a need to process some 1500 who 
were stranded last summer in rome and vienna by an upsurge in soviet 
permits 
last year 20421 immigrants reached the united states from the 
soviet union about 9400 of them jews

an antinuclear group on thursday urged three 
major us banks with large loans to brazil and argentina to use 
their influence to dissuade those two nations from developing 
nuclear weapons 
in no area of the world is the issue of nuclear proliferation 
more uncertain than in latin america said jeremy j stone 
president of the federation of american scientists a group of 5000 
scientists seeking to end the nuclear arms race 
stone said he made the plea in the form of a shareholders 
resolution that federation members who hold bank stock had submitted 
to citicorp bank of america and manufacturers hanover he said 
those banks have loans totalling 10 billion to brazil and argentina 
the resolution urged each bank to commend the two countries for 
their declared policy of using nuclear power only for peaceful 
purposes and to convey to suitable brazilian and argentine 
officials its view that nuclear explosives and a nuclear arms race 
in latin america would complicate the banks ability to sustain its 
financial links to that region 
neither brazil nor argentina is believed to have nuclear weapons 
but both are developing nuclear plants that when fully operational 
could produce nuclear weapons material according to a statement 
released by the federation 
both nations have recently gone from military to civilian rule 
argentina in 1983 and brazil in 1985 a transition which in the view 
of nuclear proliferation expert leonard s spector has decreased 
their inclination to develop nuclear weapons 
spector a scholar at the carnegie endowment for international 
peace in washington wrote in his 1987 book going nuclear that 
brazil and argentina are the only nations in south america with 
programs that might lead to the development of a nuclear deterrent 
since the summer of 1987 the leaders of each country have 
visited classified nuclear installations of the other developments 
which in this field are unprecedented confidencebuilding steps 
spector said in an interview 
but the political climate could change said spector and the 
nuclear programs in the two countries are reaching a point where 
dangerous ambiguities are going to arise creating suspicions in 
both countries that the other is moving to acquire nuclear weapons 
what we need to do is encourage positive political steps to 
slow down the technological trends he said 
argentinta and brazil have refused to sign binding 
nonproliferation pledges under the 1968 treaty on the 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons which has been ratified by 
over 130 governments 
a spokesman for manufacturers hanover trust john meyers said 
bank had loans of 14 billion to argentina and 2 billion to 
brazil he said the bank had received the resolution and would 
respond but had no immediate public comment 
spokesmen for citicorp and bank of america could not immediately 
be reached for comment

handinhand president reagan and his wife 
walked down the little path that leads from the oval office to the 
south drive to greet the next occupants of the white house well 
sign over the lease later reagan told reporters 
the long black limousine bringing vice president and mrs bush 
from andrews air force base stopped at the foot of the walk and the 
first one out was sen dan quayle the vice presidentelect who had 
been riding in the jump seat 
often in american history when outgoing and incoming president 
meet at the white house the atmosphere is strained and the words 
stilted but reagan had gone all out to get his vice president 
elected and on wednesday when they gathered for the first time 
since the election all was cheer 
there he is said bush when he spotted the president thank 
you so much 
reagan bush quayle and their wives nancy barbara and marilyn 
shook hands all around and walked into the oval office for less than 
five minutes of transition talk 
do you like the looks of the place shouted a reporter 
beautiful day said the vice presidentelect look good to 
you 
beautiful day 
later speaking to a few hundred supporters in the rose garden 
with reagan at his side bush said i dont believe theres a case 
in modern presidential politics of a president whos worked so hard 
to help someone else achieve this office and i will always be 
grateful 
and reagan if anyone wants to know how nancy and i feel about 
this moment just read our smiles he then mentioned that he 
figures its only 1188 days until the iowa caucus 
in the mellowness of the moment reagan praised the democrats who 
ran against bush and quayle 
i want to congratulate both of you as well as governor 
michael dukakis and senator lloyd bentsen in taking on the 
great challenge and your sense of public duty in seeing it through 
to the end 
each of you is better for it and so is the country said 
reagan as for the new administration you aint seen nothing 
yet 
quayle was the last to take the microphone thank you for all 
you have done for america he told reagan 
and to bush yesterday the american people overwhelmingly 
placed their trust and their confidence in your leadership and im 
delighted to be part of that team and ready to go to work and change 
america and make it even greater

michael dukakis was back tending to statehouse 
duties a day after losing his bid for the white house promising to 
be massachusetts very best governor and warning that the 
negative tone of this years campaign set a dangerous precedent for 
coming races 
i gave it my best shot dukakis said wednesday after spending 
several hours catching up on state business almost doesnt count 
in politics 
he said he felt no bitterness toward george bush and was ready to 
put the campaign behind him and complete the final two years of his 
term as governor dukakis gave no indication whether he will run for 
a fourth term in 1990 or seek the presidency again in four years 
at this point my job is clear im going to be the very best 
governor of this commonwealth that i can be dukakis told 
reporters theres a lot to do there are many challenges out 
there ahead what happens in the future remains to be seen 
among those challenges will be reestablishing relations with his 
state legislature amid growing rumbling about the dukakis 
administrations handling of a revenue shortfall that has forced 
massachusetts to borrow to pay its bills 
although it is dominated by democrats the legislature has 
scheduled hearings next week to look into state finances and 
dukakis could come under fire from lawmakers unhappy that the 
governor was out of state for much of the past year as the problem 
unfolded 
at the same time dukakis said he expected to remain a player in 
national democratic party politics including having a say in the 
selection of a new party chairman 
dukakis wasted no time getting back to work arriving at the 
office at 930 am to applause from about 50 state workers later 
in the day he met with reporters to reflect on the campaign which 
he said left presidentelect bush without a mandate and the 
democratic party with lasting grassroots and fundraising 
organizations despite his loss 
im not a bitter person a weary dukakis said i look 
forward im fundamentally an optimist and somebody who believes 
deeply in this country and its people 
am i disappointed sure i am he said laying at least part 
of the blame for his loss on the tone of the bush campaign 
it was a distorted campaign the massachusetts governor said 
it was a campaign that distorted my record and i think did not set 
high standards for the kind of campaign we want for the presidency 
and it may well set a standard we live to regret 
national democratic leaders were unhappy with the insular 
management of the dukakis effort yet dukakis trumpeted himself as 
someone who would keep a high profile within his party 
ill be in the thick of the fight to make sure that we respond 
to the real concerns of the people of this coutnry dukakis said 
i personally will continue to do whatever i can with my fellow 
governors the congress with the new administration here in 
massachusetts to make sure that we respond and that we respond 
strongly and well to those concerns and those challenges which face 
the american people every day 
dukakis also had a bit of advice for future candidates 
i think one of the lessons of the campaign is that you have to 
respond and you have to respond quickly said dukakis who largely 
ignored unrelenting gop attacks and advisers urging him to respond 
until late in the campaign 
but he had no substantive answer to the democratic partys 
dilemma while it has great success in local state and 
congressional races it has had only one successful presidential 
candidate in the last 20 years 
dukakis also offered a few jokes before saying goodbye to the 
large national press corps that traveled with him 
i believe in the redemption of souls he deadpanned when 
asked about the appointment of james a baker iii who managed the 
bush campaign dukakis so frequently criticized as secretary of 
state 
he drew laughter again when asked why he didnt campaign 
throughout the race as furiously as he did in the final three days 
when he stumped virtually nonstop without sleep 
if i had more time youd all be in the hospital he said 
with a grin i wouldnt have done that to you guys i think too 
much of you

if george bush wants advice from former 
presidents he is likely to have more of them to call upon than any 
president since abraham lincoln 
for the first time since martin van buren died on july 24 1862 
there are expected to be four living expresidents after 
inauguration day on jan 20 
this of course assumes that president reagan and the three 
former presidents now living richard nixon gerald ford and jimmy 
carter survive to see bush sworn in 
all of them are believed to be in good health reagan is the 
oldest at 77 nixon and ford are 75 and carter 64 
there have only been four times in american history when as many 
as four former presidents were living during the administrations 
of john quincy adams james knox polk james buchanan and lincoln 
actually when lincoln moved into the white house in march of 
1861 there were five of his predecessors still around in addition 
to buchanan whom he succeeded they were van buren john tyler 
millard fillmore and franklin pierce 
tyler died in january 1862 and van buren died six months later 
five times in history there have been no former presidents alive 
most recently for the last year and a half of the nixon 
administration after lyndon b johnson died in january 1973 
george washington of course could not call on one of his 
predecessors for advice because he didnt have any as for his 
successor john adams washington died in december 1979 midway 
through the adams administration 
adams and his three successors thomas jefferson james madison 
and james monroe all survived into the administration of adams 
son john quincy adams 
the elder adams was the longest lived of american presidents 
dying at 91 
the younger adams andrew jackson van buren and tyler all lived 
into the polk administration of the 1840s 
polk died at 53 shortly after leaving office but van buren 
tyler fillmore and pierce all lived into and through buchanans 
term as president 
fillmore and pierce along with andrew johnson were living when 
ulysses s grant took office in 1869 but all had died by the time 
grant left the white house in 1877 
the next time the nation was left without a living expresident 
was during the last two months of the herbert hoover administration 
following the death of calvin coolidge in january 1933 
hoover was the only living president throughout the white house 
tenure of franklin d roosevelt and harry s truman 
both truman and president dwight eisenhower named hoover to head 
commissions to reorganize the executive branch of government 
reagan has met privately with nixon several times during his 
administration

vice presidentelect dan quayle is getting 
ready to settle into his new job in january while his wife 
apparently is mulling what to do if offered her husbands vacant 
senate seat 
as sen quayle rind headed toward his transition headquarters 
near the white house wednesday mrs quayle was asked by reporters 
if she was interested in succeeding her husband 
youll have to ask the governor she replied thats an 
answer ill give him youll be the second to know 
quayle has refused to say when he would officially notify indiana 
gov robert orr of his resignation from the senate 
he has signaled several times in recent days that he would submit 
his resignation before orrs term ends in january so that the 
republican governor rather than democratic govelect evan bayh 
can appoint someone to fill the senate seat 
quayle also said he had no specific timetable for making staff 
appointments and said his tour of the fourstory whitebrick 
townhouse off lafayette park was aimed at assembling thoughts 
conversing with people nothing specific 
when we have specific things believe me youll be the first 
to know the senator said a day after he and vice president 
george bush scored a lopsided electoral triumph over democrats 
michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen 
quayle had no public events on his schedule today and aides said 
he would continue to make telephone calls and contacts as he works 
on the transition 
there has been widespread speculation that marilyn quayle a 
licensed lawyer in addition to being a housewife is among those 
under consideration to take her husbands senate seat among other 
names mentioned in indiana republican political circles are rep dan 
coats and indianapolis mayor william hudnut and possibly lt gov 
john mutz who lost to bayh on tuesday 
the quayles have sought to minimize speculation that mrs quayle 
is interested in succeeding her husband 
the couple have three children tucker 14 benjamin 12 and 
corinne 9 and it is believed that one obstacle to mrs quayles 
taking on a senate seat is their concern about both parents being 
involved in extremely demanding jobs 
on wednesday afternoon quayle rode out to andrews air force base 
in suburban maryland to greet bush on the vice presidents return 
from texas 
bush praised quayle saying hes going to be one of the great 
vice presidents you watch him closely 
bush and his wife barbara and quayle and his wife drove to the 
white house where they exchanged tributes with president reagan 
as one who came to the senate in 1980 thank you for all you 
have done for america quayle said the american people 
overwhelmingly placed their trust and their confidence in your 
leadership and im delighted to be a part of that team and am ready 
to go to work and change america and make it even greater

presidentelect george bush vowing to 
revitalize government with a brand new team of people has 
instructed key figures from his campaign to develop priorities for 
the crucial first 100 days of his coming administration 
even before bush won the presidency job applications were 
pouring into his standby transition office the stream of resumes is 
expected to turn into a flood now at newly opened bush transition 
headquarters 
just hours after claiming victory bush took the first steps 
wednesday toward assembling his presidency 
the presidentelect at a news conference in his adopted home of 
houston before flying back to washington named james a baker iii 
his campaign chairman and longtime trusted adviser to be secretary 
of state it could be the most important post in a bush presidency 
given the vice presidents emphasis on foreign affairs and his 
interest in pursuing progress with moscow 
baker while preparing for his diplomatic duties also will play 
a major role in the transfer of power to bush from ronald reagan 
craig fuller bushs vice presidential chief of staff and 
campaign pollster robert teeter will share authority as cochairmen 
of the transition team 
mindful that the first months of an administration set the tone 
for relations with congress and foreign governments bush said i 
will have a game plan 
part of what the transition is about is to spell out the 
priorities i spelled them out during the campaign in broad terms 
in terms of keeping the economic expansion going and in terms of 
world peace but the election ended yesterday bush said 
we will now have 73 days to formulate a game plan the 
first 100 day priorities if you will and theyll be specific 
in an announcement sure to send shivers through the ranks of the 
5000 political appointees happily at work in the reagan 
administration bush said i will for the most part bring in a 
brand new team of people from across the country 
and in my view that will reinvigorate the process bush said 
he deliberately left room for some reagan holdovers and veterans 
to join his administration there will be a major turnover but 
some people at various levels may be asked to remain 
on the flight back to washington bush said he wanted to announce 
the rest of his cabinet sooner rather than way late and would 
think about the possible choices during a florida vacation this 
weekend 
it has been widely assumed bush will ask treasury secretary 
nicholas brady attorney general dick thornburgh and education 
secretary lauro cavazos to stay on all three joined the reagan 
administration in recent months 
thornburgh said wednesday he had been given no indication of 
whether bush wanted him to remain nor have i sought any 
information on the question the washington post reported bush 
wanted to replace thornburgh with former environmental protection 
agency chief and deputy attorney general william ruckelshaus or 
illinois gov james thompson thompson said wednesday he wasnt 
interested 
former sen john tower of texas an arms negotiator in the reagan 
administration who later advised bushs campaign on national 
security matters may be in line for secretary of defense 
ann dore mclaughlin may keep her post as labor secretary or get 
another cabinet position possibly interior where she was 
undersecretary from 1984 to 1987 
others mentioned as possible nominees for the labor post include 
rep tom ridge rpa and constance horner now director of the 
office of personnel management 
former transportation secretary elizabeth dole wife of onetime 
bush rival bob dole also is mentioned as a candidate for another 
cabinet job 
for the powerful post of budget chief the odds on favorite is 
richard darman a onetime senior aide in the reagan white house and 
later deputy secretary of treasury 
darmans name also has been mentioned as the new white house 
chief of staff although fuller and new hampshire gov john sununu 
are more frequently discussed for that job sununu also is a 
candidate to be secretary of energy 
richard burt ambassador to west germany is known to be 
interested in the job of national security adviser at the white 
house brent scowcroft who served in that role for president ford 
is mentioned for it again 
over the next 2 months power will begin to shift from reagan to 
bush as the federal bureaucracy and foreign governments look to the 
incoming president for a signal of his intentions 
however bush said president reagan is still the president of 
the united states and i will not be using the transition to try to 
make or unduly influence decisions that are properly the 
presidents 
policy matters aside bush indicated his management style will be 
different from reagan for example he said he will be briefed 
directly every day by the cia on intelligence matters instead of 
relying on the white house national security adviser for an update 
as reagan had 
bush also announced that boyden gray his legal adviser in the 
vice presidents office will serve the same role in the transition 
and then go on to the white house as his general counsel 
chase untermeyer former assistant secretary of the navy who has 
been a oneman transition planner for bush will be the transitions 
chief personnel headhunter and keep the same job in the white house 
come jan 20 
sheila tate who has been the campaign secretary will be press 
secretary during the transition bush did not mention whether she 
would have that title in the white house and some gop sources close 
to the campaign indicate someone else may get the job 
altogether there are 5000 political appointments divided 
between presidential appointments and those made by cabinet 
secretaries and agency heads 
many of the 3000 or so presidential appointments do not really 
draw the attention of the chief executive and are handled by others 
its in the hundreds rather than the thousands that really 
matter untermeyer said

malfunctions in a ventilation system designed to 
contain deadly microbes will delay occupancy of a 23 million 
research building at the centers for disease control until at least 
next year officials said wednesday 
the new maximumcontainment laboratory for which a 
ribboncutting ceremony was held last month is part of cdcs shift 
from investigating outbreaks of disease to basic research into 
infectious disease 
an estimated 80 researchers had planned to move into the building 
this fall but the move will be delayed until problems are worked 
out in the complex ventilation system 
they want to be sure before they clear a system like that for 
people like me to crawl under a hood and begin working with a hot 
virus said dr thomas fowlkes director of the cdcs retrovirus 
laboratory 
the system is designed to keep air pressure inside the buildings 
12 laboratories slightly below normal atmospheric pressure so that 
air from the hallways always flows into the labs the intentional 
draft is supposed to keep microbes such as viruses from being 
carried out of the labs 
viruses that will be studied at the labs include those that cause 
aids and lassa fever which has caused epidemics of hemorrhagic 
fever in nigeria 
steve white the cdc engineer responsible for operating the air 
system said wednesday that the problems lie somewhere in the 96 
pneumatic control units whose delicate sensors and valves measure 
and adjust air pressure throughout the building 
for unknown reasons changes in air pressure such as those 
caused by an open door throw the gauges out of adjustment 
the building originally was scheduled for completion in late 1987

directors guild of america is red all over 
the hollywood industry group said wednesday nights showing of a 
colorenhanced version of casablanca on cable televisions 
superstation tbs represented a new low point in the battle to 
degrade an american art form the 1941 classic which also starred 
ingrid bergman was filmed in black and white 
in total disregard for the place casablanca holds in 
americas cultural heritage tbs has gone ahead with a computerized 
assault on one of historys greatest and mostbeloved motion 
pictures glenn gumpel the dgas executive director said in a 
statement 
for those who choose to watch the broadcast we would simply 
remind them that what they are seeing is not casablanca but a 
computerized parody of an original and classic work he said 
in the past tbs owner ted turner who also owns mgms film 
library has experienced similar criticism but healthy ratings for 
its colorized versions of old movie classics turner has responded 
to such criticism in the past by saying i own it ill do what i 
want with it

senate democrats assured of improving their 
majority control by at least one seat are signaling presidentelect 
george bush that they want to avoid partisan warfare with the 
republican white house when the 101st congress convenes in january 
the final margin of the democratic grip on the senate from 
tuesdays elections will not be clear until a cliffhanger race in 
florida is resolved 
the margin of victory for either republican rep connie mack iii 
or democratic rep buddy mackay will not be known until state 
election officials complete the formidable task of counting the 
estimated 100000 absentee ballots the last to be tallied of the 
four million votes cast 
the vote counting was not expected to be complete until sometime 
today at the earliest 
mackay held a slim lead before the absentee ballots were put on 
the counting tables but after the first results became known mack 
had erased mackays advantage and had built a small lead of his own 
a victory by mack would leave democrats with 55 of the 100 senate 
seats up one from the 5446 majority they held during the 100th 
congress a mackay victory would hand the democrats a 5644 edge 
in tuesdays balloting in 33 senate races republicans lost seats 
in connecticut nebraska nevada and virginia democratic seats were 
captured by republican candidates in mississippi and montana 
even if democrats were to lose in florida they still would have 
the majority that carries with it the chairmanship of all senate 
committees and the right to set the chambers agenda 
some lawmakers indicated that does not necessarily mean trouble 
ahead for republican presidentelect george bush 
sen joseph r biden jr ddel chairman of the judiciary 
committee said he and other chairmen are prepared to work with 
president bush and do that straight up no holds barred and find 
whether he means what he says when he says that he expects to have a 
close relationship with the senate and the house 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said late tuesday night that he 
believes bush will find a cooperative spirit on capitol hill because 
the problems are too important for congress not to work with the 
president 
sen pete domenici rnm predicted budget issues will dominate 
the attention of the senate and house next year the new presidents 
oftrepeated opposition to higher taxes will be the big sticking 
point in his dealings with congress domenici added 
while most of the senate races were won by decisive margins one 
was so close that the outcome may be challenged 
in wyoming republican sen malcolm wallop won a third term by a 
razorthin edge over democratic challenger john vinich with 
unofficial returns giving the incumbent a 1310vote edge over the 
democrat 
but the democratic senatorial campaign commmittee charged 
irregularities in the handling of absentee ballots 
secretary of state kathy karpan said that after reviewing the 
campaign committees allegations with 23 county clerks offices she 
had no reason to call for a recount in the contest 
karpan said state law requires a recount if the difference 
between the two candidates votes is less than 1 percent of those 
cast for the winner in the case of the senate race the difference 
would have to have been less than 911 votes 
however a candidate may request a recount if he agrees to pay 
for it recounting the votes would cost a maximum of 11500 karpan 
said 
vinich a state senator said wednesday his campaign was still 
considering whether to ask for a recount 
in connecticut liberal republican sen lowell weicker who 
served 18 years conceded wednesday night after losing by just over 
10000 votes to democrat joseph lieberman the state attorney 
general 
weicker in a news conference in greenwich town hall shouldered 
the responsibility for his defeat and ruled out any future in 
politics 
im a big guy i take care of myself i take shots ive given 
shots he said im responsible for last nights results 
i didnt lose this race by a few thousand votes the former 
senator said in my mind and in my heart i lost it by 100000 
this wasnt a close race it was a clear mandate by the state of 
connecticut that matters that i stood for are not to their liking 
and that matters that mr lieberman stood for are to their liking 
while 10 new senators were elected tuesday there will be 11 new 
faces when the senate convenes in january republican vice 
presidentelect dan quayle has indicated that he would step down 
before january so indianas gop gov robert orr not the incoming 
governor democrat evan bayh can appoint a successor

the justice departments civil rights chief is 
leaving government next month after a sevenyear tenure marked by 
support from conservatives and condemnation from civil rights groups 
for his attacks on affirmative action 
william bradford reynolds assistant attorney general in charge 
of the civil rights division said wednesday he is resigning 
effective dec 9 
reynolds said he probably will remain in the washington area to 
practice law and is discussing job possibilities with private firms 
in an interview reynolds said he felt the reagan 
administrations greatest achievement in the civil rights field has 
been restoring the principle of nondiscrimination to its rightful 
pedestal 
he said his greatest disappointment was getting word of our 
extraordinary record out to the public in the way i would have 
wanted 
reynolds spearheaded the reagan administrations opposition to 
affirmative action hiring and promotion programs and other 
antidiscrimination tools that had been at the heart of federal 
civil rights policies since the 1960s 
liberals expressed pleasure over his resignation while 
conservatives praised his record 
if brad reynolds departure is an indication of what the bush 
justice department will look like then this is a hopeful sign 
indeed said arthur kropp president of people for the american 
way a civil liberties organization with 270000 members reynolds 
will be missed by civil rights advocates about as much as 
environmentalists miss former interior secretary james watt 
terry eastland a former justice department spokesman under 
former attorney general edwin meese iii and now a resident scholar 
of the national legal center for the public interest called 
reynolds a man dedicated to colorblind law 
he deserves great credit for making often courageous attempts 
to advance that cause eastland said 
in areas ranging from forced school busing to employment 
discrimination to voting rights brad reynolds has had a greater 
impact upon the law in this area than anyone since lyndon johnson 
said patrick korten another former meese justice department 
spokesman who is now with the heritage foundation a conservative

an investigation board determined 
that inadequate procedures and poor design were mainly to blame for 
a flash fire that did minor damage to the magellan venus space probe 
the fire occurred oct 17 in a checkout hangar here when a 
technician inadvertently hooked up an electrical connector with the 
wrong jack creating a short circuit that triggered a two to 
threeinch flame from a test battery on the spacecraft 
the national aeronautics and space administration estimated the 
small blaze did 87000 damage to the battery electrical wiring and 
an insulation blanket officials said the accident would have no 
impact of magellans april launch toward venus from the space 
shuttle atlantis 
in its final report released wednesday the board did not blame 
the technician saying he had to work in the blind in a confined 
area while making the connection because of the spacecrafts design 
the board recommended that procedures for hooking up the battery 
connector be revised to permit easier access and greater visibility 
said jon r busse who headed the investigation 
the board also said that before the accident it was believed the 
connector could not cause a short if it made contact with the wrong 
jack but subsequent testing showed electrical contact can be made 
on at least 10 of the 37 pins in the connector it recommended that 
nasa issue an alert of this possibility 
martin marietta which made the spacecraft said in a statement 
that it is making design and procedural changes recommended by the 
board

the nuclear regulatory commission has 
continuing and sometimes chronic problems with its procedures 
for licensing people to handle radioactive materials the 
investigative arm of congress said in a report 
the general accounting office report said the nrc usually does 
not verify license application information visit the nuclear 
facility before granting a license or have specific criteria for 
determining when to reject a license application 
it said that as a result nrc is overly vulnerable to dishonest 
or careless applicants 
all of these weaknesses or problems increase the publics risk 
of exposure said the report issued wednesday 
rep edward feighan dohio had asked for the gao investigation 
after a september 1986 accidental spill of radioactive material that 
had been smuggled onto wrightpatterson air force base near dayton 
ohio 
feighan issued a statement calling on the nrc to take immediate 
action to correct deficiencies identified in the report 
we have every right to expect quick response from an agency 
that oversees hazardous materials licensing unfortunately there is 
little in the gao report to suggest that the nrc has corrected 
critical problems identified over the last 16 years feighan said 
nrc spokesman john kopack said the agency would not discuss the 
report until after the agencys staff had reviewed it 
the report noted that the nrc has limited resources 25 fulltime 
license reviewers and 36 inspectors versus 7700 licenses for 
industrial and other uses of radioactive materials 
in addition to granting licenses without verifying applicants 
claims or visiting facilities the report said the nrc 
doesnt have checklists to determine when a license application 
should be denied or when repeat violators should get extra penalties 
doesnt make sure licenceholders can afford to clean up after 
an accident 
takes too long to renew licenses and make inspections because of 
large backlogs 
in the case that led to the gao inquiry the nrc gave a 
radioactive materialshandling license to a 10thgrade dropout 
without checking his claims about training and experience 
the agency learned jc haynes of newark ohio had provided 
false information on his application only after it issued the 
license which enabled haynes to use radioactive material to change 
the color of diamonds 
despite this finding haynes was not only allowed to keep the 
license but it was amended to permit him to use larger quantities of 
americium in any form the report said 
americium a hazardous byproduct of nuclear reactors turns 
diamonds green and makes lesserquality stones more saleable its 
radiation is 1000 times more potent than a typical hospital 
diagnostic procedure 
haynes illegally disposed of some of his radioactive waste at a 
highsecurity munitions area of wrightpatterson air force base 
two accidental discharges there in 1986 forced the air force to 
tear down a storage building and invest 1 million to decontaminate 
the area the environmental protection agencys superfund paid out 
385000 to clean up haynes contaminated home 
in another case reviewed in the report the nrc conducted no 
inspections between 1979 and 1986 at ohios case western reserve 
university which was licensed to conduct research on a number of 
radioactive materials 
the 1986 inspection discovered coffee cups and food in the 
laboratories too close to radiation sources a problem the 
university had agreed to correct in 1975 last year the university 
was fined 10000 and its license was suspended after the nrc 
identified 21 license violations including the storage of food in 
restricted areas

as germans commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 
nazi pogrom called kristallnacht one of europes largest jewish 
cemeteries is in ruins and one of its most magnificent synagogues 
remains a bombedout hulk 
both sites are in east berlin and have been focal points of 
observances of the nov 910 1938 attacks by nazi thugs on jews 
their businesses and synagogues that launched the holocaust 
in the 108yearold jewish cemetery the graves of onceprominent 
berlin intellectuals artists scientists and businessmen are 
overgrown by trees and shrubs visitors must weave through dense 
underbrush to view gravestones toppling after decades of neglect 
the onceornate synagogue built in 1866 escaped destruction 
during kristallnacht which means night of broken glass in german 
witnesses say a police officer prevented nazi brownshirts from 
starting enough fires to destroy the building then called a fire 
brigade that put out the blaze 
but the synagogue was heavily damaged during allied bombing raids 
in 1943 and only its colored oriental brick facade and turret 
remain 
both landmarks are remants of the citys rich jewish history and 
east germanys communist authorities say they intend to aid efforts 
by east berlins tiny jewish community to restore the cemetery in 
the citys onceaffluent weissensee section 
an international trust has been set up with the consent of the 
government to help finance restoration of the synagogue a task 
jewish community spokeswoman irene runge says will take at least 
five years 
before the holocaust 170000 jews lived in berlin alone now an 
estimated 450600 practicing jews live in all of east germany about 
half of them in the communist half of the divided city they have no 
permament rabbi 
so far much of the restoration work on the cemetery has been 
done by the small and financially strapped jewish community with 
the help of student and church groups 
there just arent enough resources to repair it and to keep it 
up said one cemetery worker 
among the 115000 jews buried there are some of the most 
influential people in berlin society until the beginning of nazi 
rule in 1933 
a special section contains the remains of 365 jews who died 
fighting for germany in world war i 
another section erected after germanys defeat in 1945 contains 
the graves of scores who died in nazi death camps 
historical accounts say jews often thronged to the cemetery to 
walk for a few undisturbed hours after nazi laws banned them from 
many areas of the city 
the cemetery was closed in 1943 and afterwards its grounds were 
used on occasion by jews in hiding historical records indicate 
during this weeks events marking the anniversary of 
kristallnacht the east german government has emphasized the role of 
the communists in fighting fascism and antisemitism 
but it has reiterated its longstanding rejection of any 
responsibility for the holocaust which claimed the lives of 6 
million jews because east germany was founded after the war 
west germany also created from the ruins of nazi germany has 
paid more than 80 billion marks 45 billion at todays rates to 
holocaust victims and their families east germany has not paid any 
reparations 
many members of east berlins jewish community are skeptical 
about the motives behind communist authorities newly expressed 
willingness to help them 
what good does this all do me if i still have to ask a german 
in uniform for permission to visit my sick brother in west berlin 
said one elderly jewish resident 
the east german government in 1961 erected a wall that divides 
the city into communist and westerncontrolled sectors

a productive summit meeting with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev and a resumption of us aid to 
contra rebels in nicaragua have high priority with presidentelect 
george bush as he prepares to move into the white house 
at a houston news conference wednesday in which he named james a 
baker iii as his choice for secretary of state bush provided more 
of an insight into his foreign policy views than he had throughout 
the election campaign 
bush ruled out a meeting with gorbachev just to get to know the 
soviet leader i am acquainted with him bush said what i 
want to see is progress ive never supported meetings just for the 
sake of having meetings 
but he defined progress in a way that was far short of a demand 
that a summit produce cosmic results bush said there were a number 
of areas arms control human rights regional disputes in which 
the superpowers could make headway 
by offering a range of categories the presidentelect took a 
positive but cautious stance on summitry with gorbachev he said 
for instance that a summit would not have to produce a treaty to 
cut longrange nuclear weapons 
president reagan on the other hand entered the white house in 
january 1981 extremely reluctant to hold a summit but after 
gorbachev took over in 1985 the two leaders met annually four 
times in all 
bush said that before he would meet with gorbachev he would have 
baker confer with the foreign ministers of the north atlantic treaty 
organization and then with soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze 
but i dont think that will start before i become president 
he said 
asked about the contras whose surreptitious receipt of millions 
of dollars from us secret arms sales to iran rocked the reagan 
administration bush explicitly supported a resumption of aid 
congress cut off all military assistance last february 
humanitarian aid in the form of food clothing and shelter is due 
to expire in march 
but bush said aid to the rebels who are at war with the 
government in nicaragua will have a high priority because freedom 
and democracy in this hemisphere have a high priority 
he said he intended to keep the pressure on the sandinistas 
in a third area bush said he believed the soviets would adhere 
to their commitment to complete the withdrawal of their military 
forces from afghanistan by feb 15 
if the soviets do not pull out bush said that will throw a 
complicating factor over the whole relationship 
in responding to reporters questions the presidentelect 
neither condemned the soviet union on any issue nor lobbed any tough 
rhetoric at moscow his overall tone on foreign policy was measured 
secretary of state george p shultz meanwhile hailed bakers 
selection as a welcome and heartening event 
in a news conference here shultz said bush had telephoned him 
before announcing the selection he will hit the ground running 
shultz said of baker a cabinet colleague and partner at 
international economic summit meetings 
his close warm and productive relationship with 
presidentelect bush makes him just the guy to serve as the 
presidents chief foreign policy adviser and as chief spokesman for 
the president and for our nations interests shultz said 
shultz and baker both are considered moderate to conservative in 
their political views and are internationally minded together they 
tried without much success to reduce the us trade deficit

this years droughtreduced corn harvest is 
expected to total 467 billion bushels 3 percent above last months 
forecast but down 34 percent from the actual 1987 harvest according 
to the agriculture department 
it represented the smallest harvest since 1983 when similar 
searing heat and lack of rain shriveled output to 417 billion 
bushels the record was 888 billion bushels in 1985 
the assessment wednesday by usdas agricultural statistics board 
based on nov 1 estimates came as farmers were trying to get the 
last of this years corn harvest out of the fields 
by the start of the month farmers had harvested an estimated 83 
percent of this falls corn acreage 7 percent behind last year but 
still 16 percent ahead of the 198387 average the report said 
the report reflected the summer drought in forecasting an average 
corn yield per acre of 832 bushels down 371 bushels from last 
year but 21 bushels above the level contained in last months 
forecast 
farmers cut back this year to a little over 567 million acres 
for corn from 591 million in 1987 one reason was government 
programs designed to take acreage out of production and thus prevent 
surpluses that drive down crop prices 
the agriculture department is forecasting an adequate supply of 
corn next year despite the drought largely because of an abundant 
existing stockpile 
usda economists say the drought is likely to add 1 percent to the 
consumer price index for food this year and 2 percent next year as 
the impact of the reduced crop is passed through to the market 
the report said the all crops index of production as of nov 
1 averaged 87 percent of the base year of 1977 down dramatically 
from 106 percent at the same time last year and the lowest level in 
10 years 
the record high for the index was 117 percent in 1981 1982 and 
1985 it dropped to 88 percent in 1983 when drought and government 
acreage cutbacks lowered production it rose to 111 the following 
year 
the report forecast soybean production at 151 billion bushels 
up 1 percent from last months forecast but 21 percent below last 
years harvest of 192 billion bushels the record was 226 billion 
bushels in 1979 
the cotton harvest was estimated at 148 million bales 1 percent 
above both the 1987 crop and the oct 1 forecast the record was 
1895 million bales in 1937 
with the harvest of 1988 crops winding down no new production 
figures were included for many earlier commodities such as wheat 
oats and barley 
other crops in the november production report included

soviet corn imports are expected to increase by 
3 million tons this year because of limited supplies of feed wheat 
on the world market and high barley prices the agriculture 
department says 
the department said wednesday the united states again is expected 
to be a major supplier followed by argentina and china 
overall soviet net grain imports should be up 2 million tons 
the department said that estimate reflected not only an increase in 
purchases of coarse grains but a drop in expected soviet wheat 
imports 
a reduced coarse grain crop in 1988 and fairly attractive world 
prices have resulted in heavy soviet corn purchases in the current 
marketing year 
the department said coarse grain purchases to date total around 8 
million tons with the bulk of the sales calling for delivery before 
the end of december 
in part because the soviets are pushing hard to increase 
livestock production the department has increased its estimate of 
soviet coarse grain imports in the marketing year that started in 
july to 17 million tons the estimate for wheat imports was set at 
13 million tons

safety concerns at the savannah river nuclear 
plant may postpone the scheduled december restart of a reactor and 
further delay fresh supplies of critical nuclear weapons materials 
says a senior energy department official 
my own view is that we have been making insufficient progress 
at the site to meet such a december date said richard w 
starostecki acting assistant energy secretary for environment 
safety and health 
he also said needed improvement in equipment and operating 
procedures throughout the nuclear weapons production complex near 
aiken sc would take years to implement 
in the past few months nuclear weapons production has ground to 
a virtual halt following shutdown of the three reactors at savannah 
river the closure of a building at the rocky flats plant near 
denver and a strike which has shut down the feed materials 
production center in fernald near cincinnati ohio 
the savannah river reactors are the only facilities in the united 
states now capable of producing plutonium and tritium which are 
needed to make nuclear weapons plutonium supplies are plentiful 
but the tritium shortage will cause problems sometime in the next 
six to 24 months according to congressional and administration 
sources 
starostecki compared the state of the federal nuclear weapons 
complex to that of the commerical nuclear power industry after the 
accident at the three mile island plant near harrisburg pa on 
march 28 1979 
he said it would take years to install safer equipment and raise 
training standards to levels commensurate with those found in 
private industry 
these are programs that will take years to develop 
starostecki said in an inteview tuesday he envisioned widescale 
introduction of robotics and remote handling devices to protect the 
health of workers but was unable to estimate the cost of such 
systemwide improvements 
to outline restart plans and get a firmer grip on a timetable for 
savannah river starostecki said he was meeting this week with 
managers from the departments office in aiken and from ei dupont 
nemours co the current contract operator and westinghouse corp 
which is to take over the plant next april 1 
i am not focusing on the date said starostecki my goal 
this week is to get the people at the contract level the dupont 
people the westinghouse people along with doe managers to review 
the status of the detailed technical acceptance criteria we are 
going to be expecting those reactors to meet 
the date will come out as a natural part of the dialogue he 
said 
last month energy secretary john s herrington said he hoped to 
begin a phased startup of the plants lreactor in december 
reaching 50 percent capacity over about a month each of the plants 
three reactors which began began operation in 1954 is restricted 
to 50 percent of full power due to safety concerns 
we will provide the secretary with an estimate of what it takes 
and when by the end of the month said starostecki 
a spokeswoman for dupont at savannah river becky apter said 
the last date i heard was dec 31 and that was subject to delay 
starostecki said the energy department would develop what he 
called compensatory operating procedures to allow safe operation 
of the facilities for savannah river those steps include 
requiring reactor operators to practice accident control 
techniques extensively on a simulator 
requiring the presence of a degreeholding engineer in the 
control room 
adding more highly trained managers and operators to the staffs 
of the contractor and the regional department office 
reorganizing and improving communication between contractor and 
departmental employees in particular assuring that those who manage 
and analyze the plant are in close contact with those in the control 
room 
developing detailed technical criteria on the operation of the 
plant and making sure it is in the hands of the operators a step 
which has not been taken before 
analyzing the ability of the reactors to withstand earthquakes 
a process now underway

michael dukakis ran the worst campaign of 
this century says one democrat but others blamed the party 
itself for losing touch with the people while some said nothing 
could overcome the republican claim to peace and prosperity 
robert slagle the democratic state chairman in texas gave no 
quarter to his partys fallen standardbearer in his election 
postmortem wednesday 
the dukakis campaign ran the worst campaign of this century 
said slagle those guys up there in boston wrapped themselves in a 
cocoon and i dont know what kind of folks theyre used to talking 
to but they didnt put a message out that was appealing to texans 
james ruvolo chairman of the ohio democratic party said 
democrats must change the perception that they are weak on defense 
this race was winnable he went on and we didnt win it 
but thats more a fault of the campaign that we ran mike 
dukakis will get a lot of blame deserved or not deserved but he 
will get it 
kathy vick of louisiana a former chairman of the association of 
state democratic party chairs said were in this position where 
we can elect everybody but a president 
we left atlanta site of the democratic national convention 
thinking we could win she said nobody thought it was going to 
be a leadpipe cinch it ended up not being close 
other prominent democrats were more circumspect 
the rev jesse jackson said on cbs this morning that with the 
partys gains in the house and senate you really should not be 
fingerpointing and blaming too much 
weve done an awful lot of right things to be as strong as we 
are as a party he said 
robert strauss the former democratic party chairman said i 
think the campaign got away from dukakis in august and september 
he let the republicans define him into something he really 
wasnt and he never got back on track 
strauss said the democrats need to take a look at the whole 
card 
theres obviously a disconnect between the primary system and 
the american people insofar as democrats are concerned he said 
rep tony coelho dcalif the party whip in the house said on 
nbc tvs today show the democratic party has to look west 
thats the area of opportunity for the democrats 
sen sam nunn dga said the partys nominee must cross the 
threshhold issues in the south with strong stands on national 
security patriotism and crime weve got to broaden the base of 
the people who consider themselves to be democrats nunn said on 
the today show 
kevin phillips a republican analyst and publisher of the 
american political report said the democratic problem was 
twothirds dukakis if he had been able to do in july and august 
what he did in late october with his spurt i think theyd have been 
looking at a different situation 
but other political analysts said bushs margin 54 percent of 
the popular vote and 426 of the 538 electoral votes was so wide 
that defeat really cannot be blamed on any dukakis foibles 
stephen hess a senior fellow at the brookings institution said 
dukakis didnt blow it he could have run better obviously 
the fundamentals of peace and prosperity were just too hard for 
democrats to overcome 
bill schneider a political analyst at the american enterprise 
institute said i dont think they could have won my guess in 
the end what defeated them was peace and prosperity i dont 
think lloyd bentsen would have won this election at the top of the 
democratic ticket 
dukakis does not deserve all the blame he is going to get for 
this loss people are going to blame dukakis as a way of avoiding 
the harsh truth about where the democratic party is today

president reagan says he vetoed a bill to 
coordinate federal policy and advice on nutrition because it would 
have created an unnecessary and complex federal bureaucracy 
backers of the bill said it was designed to make the government 
speak with one voice on nutrition instead of having several agencies 
an departments issue conflicting advice to the public 
the administration strongly supports the principal goals of 
this legislation and reaffirms its commitment to use existing 
authority to achieve these ends reagan said in a statement 
wednesday however enactment of the bill would set up federal 
nutrition efforts on the wrong course 
the bill would create a substantial amount of unnecessary and 
complex federal bureaucracy that would hamper the achievement of the 
bills goals he said 
reagan also vetoed a bill requiring specific questions in the 
1990 census relating to plumbing facilities and heating and cooling 
equipment he said the questions would not produce enough useful 
information to justify the increased cost and paperwork 
the nutrition bill gave shared responsibility for the program to 
the agriculture department and the department of health and human 
services and would also have created an administrator of nutrition 
monitoring an interagency board and an advisory council 
the creation of so much new federal bureaucracy would hinder 
rather than aid performance of federal nutritionrelated 
functions reagan said 
the bill also would impose a substantial new burden on the 
american taxpayer in future years to pay for federal government 
grants by requiring that a grant program be established as a 
result of the study he said 
experience shows that once the federal government begins 
handing out money under a new grant program a political 
constituency develops that demands greater funding for that 
program the president said

washington ap the afghan rebels have the apparent 
endorsement of the reagan administration in their latest drive 
against soviet troops and government forces 
secretary of state george p shultz said after reviewing the 
situation wednesday with a top rebel leader we see it eye to 
eye 
there were no us calls for restraint as burhanuddin rabbani 
held backtoback meetings with president reagan and shultz 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said we will continue to 
provide support for the mujahedeen as long as the soviet union is 
providing support for the kabul regime and we would not intervene 
to direct their activities beyond that 
about 50000 soviet troops remain in afghanistan they are due to 
leave by feb 15 but last friday citing rebel attacks the soviets 
announced a suspension 
in the meantime the soviets brought in new missiles and fighter 
planes and used the weapons against the rebels who are armed by 
the united states 
rabbani said we are ready to talk to the russians directly to 
know what their worries are about the withdrawal of their troops 
but he said the guerrilla attacks would continue as long as the 
soviets remained 
last week state department officials urged both the rebels and 
the soviets to show restraint the aim was to maintain the red 
armys exodus from afghanistan after nearly nine year of fighting 
rabbani in his meetings here evidently got a green light to 
keep up the pressure both shultz and fitzwater left that impression 
referring to the rebels shultz said they are being attacked 
the soviets should not have troops in afghanistan in the first 
place so they should leave as they agreed to 
rabbani declared meanwhile that the guerrillas had decided to 
close the main road used by soviet troops to leave afghanistan 
it is true he said 
however he left open whether the rebels would launch a military 
operation against the red army in the kabul area 
it would depend on the military situation rabbani said 
our aim is peace but if the russians intensify the war we have 
no choice 
the road much of which is tunneled leads from the capital 
northward to the soviet union

a private health advocacy group is calling for 
an immediate halt to the use of silicone implants for breast 
enlargement even as the food and drug administration has started a 
review of the issue that will take at least two years 
in a letter to fda commissioner frank young released wednesday 
dr sidney m wolfe head of public citizen health research group 
also said the agency should issue an immediate alert telling the 
estimated 2 million women who have had such procedures they may run 
a heightened risk of health problems including cancer 
the agency has already scheduled a meeting of its plastic surgery 
devices advisory panel to review potential health problems that may 
be caused by silicone breast implants it issued a background paper 
on the topic last week 
the fda said it has invoked a procedure whereby silicone gel 
implants will have to undergo the type of scientific review normally 
associated with new medical devices even though the implants were 
already on the market in 1976 that was the year congress gave the 
fda authority over such products which were given grandfather 
approval under the legislation 
the fda said it decided there are sufficient concerns about 
these products to call for premarket approval applications this 
means that in order for the implants to remain on the market 
manufacturers will have to supply fda with scientific data 
demonstrating that they are safe and effective 
the agency noted that the law sets a schedule giving the makers 
of such grandfathered products time to provide documentation for 
the safety of their products and said in the case of silicone 
implants the deadline can be no sooner than december 1990 
the advisory panel will be asked specifically to recommend what 
kind of scientific data manufacturers should be required to submit 
while the full review is in progress the fda said it will see 
that the labeling information manufacturers are required to supply 
doctors explains adequately what is known about potential risks 
the fda document said the agency has been increasingly 
concerned about reports of adverse effects from breast implants 
particularly in view of the large number of women who receive them 
the agency said about 130000 breast implants are done per year 
most for cosmetic purposes about 15 percent involve women having 
breast reconstruction after cancer surgery 
there have been reports of fibrous tissue growth around 
implants which can cause a painful hardening of the breast the 
fda document said it is also possible that the implants could 
interfere with mammography pictures of the breast 
moreover it said small quantities of the gel have also been 
shown to migrate throughout the body and this has raised questions 
about possible effects on the immune system and the fetus 
the agency also referred to a study by dow corning corp a major 
manufacturer of silicone gel that showed the gel can produce tumors 
in laboratory rats 
although it is unlikely that this finding is relevant to 
humans the possibility of a cancer risk cannot be completely ruled 
out the fda said 
dow corning said in a statement that based on broad experience 
with implants for more than two decades it has confidence in 
their safety 
patients who have had such surgery or who are considering it 
face no significant risk based on all the data available to date 
the company said 
it added that dow corning and other implant manufacturers have 
been working with the fda to determine whether any further studies 
are needed to document the safety of breast implants and that dow 
has told the agency it is committed to conducting any such studies 
expeditiously

republican hopes that a strong presidential run 
by george bush would provide the impetus needed to pick off a few 
democratic members of the house seem to have gone unfulfilled 
with votecounting complete for all but three races for the 435 
house seats there is little evidence that bushs victory did very 
much if anything for gop house hopefuls 
by late wednesday democrats had boosted their overall majority 
in the chamber to 259 to 173 a pickup of two seats and led in all 
three undecided contests they padded the 7739 edge they had held 
in the 100th congress in the 11 states of the old confederacy by two 
seats even though bush swept the south 
rep beryl anthony dark chairman of the democratic 
congressional campaign committee boasted wednesday that bush had 
shown no coattails at all 
in fact in his home state of texas where we picked up two 
republican house seats he must have been wearing a tearaway 
jersey 
republicans conceded almost as much 
congressional races particularly house races are not national 
elections said rep guy vander jagt rmich who heads the 
national republican campaign committee theyre essentially local 
races between two people who are fighting it out 
in north carolina the gop hoped to knock off three democratic 
incumbents not only did all three democrats win but one of them 
rep david price won by 16 points enlarging his 12point victory 
of 1986 
some other potential coattail victims showed no ill effects from 
the bush win always vulnerable rep peter kostmayer dpa 
enlarged his 10point 1986 margin to 16 points this time rep wayne 
owens dutah an 11point winner in 1986 coasted to a 16point 
edge tuesday 
still others waivered but did not crumble freshman rep liz 
patterson dsc considered a possible loser defeated gop 
candidate knox white by four points just one point less than her 
1986 win and rep george brown dcalif saw his 14point 1986 
victory shrink to 12 points this year 
the dust had yet to settle in three congressional districts where 
thousands of absentee ballots had yet to be counted in tabulations 
that may take days 
rep william v chappell jr held a 1166vote lead over 
republican craig t james a political novice in a district 
surrounding daytona beach fla chappell is a 20year house veteran 
and chairman of the defense appropriations subcommittee but his 
name has come up in reports on the continuing investigation into the 
pentagon purchasing scandal 
democrat nita lowey a former new york assistant secretary of 
state clung to a 2594vote lead over twoterm gop rep joseph 
dioguardi in westchester county his prospects were hindered by 
reports that he accepted 57000 in illegal campaign contributions 
from an auto dealer 
and south of portland ore fourterm gop rep denny smith 
trailed state legislator mike kopetski by 1573 votes 
so far only four incumbents seeking reelection had lost 
the most prominent was banking committee chairman fernand st 
germain dri whose 28year house career was ended by republican 
newcomer ronald machtley st germain investigated by the justice 
department earlier this year on allegations that he accepted favors 
from lobbyists is likely to be succeeded as committee chairman by

george bushs solid victory lacked the majority 
support of several voter groups including moderates and roman 
catholics that would be crucial to a lasting republican 
realignment say poll analysts 
the share of voters calling themselves democrats went up compared 
with 1984 an nbc newswall street journal poll found while 
republican numbers held about steady democrats thus were able to 
gain in other races 
the republicans have held on to the numbers they had in 1984 
but the democrats have gone back to their numbers in 1980 said 
laurily epstein nbcs chief pollster despite the bush victory 
weve gone back to a situation where the democrats are the majority 
party 
overall the polls said bush stitched together enough of the 
reagan coalition of 1980 and 1984 to win the election handily but 
they indicated that majority support from some key groups was 
lacking 
catholics voted for jimmy carter in 1976 but solidly for reagan 
in 1980 and 1984 tuesday they went back to the democrats backing 
dukakis by 5248 percent in nbcjournal exit polling 
reagan split women with carter in 1980 and won women in 1984 
tuesday a majority of women voted for dukakis 
moderates backed carter in 1976 then moved to reagan in the 
next two elections tuesday they voted for dukakis by 5446 in 
nbcjournal polling 
bush also won independents by smaller margins than reagans and 
while he pulled in 17 percent of democrats in cbs newsnew york 
times polling that was down from reagans roughly 25 percent in 
1980 and 84 
bushs support also seemed to lack a strong personal endorsement 
from the voters pollsters said and his recreation of the reagan 
coalition paled in comparison even if partly because reagans 
popularity is so great 
i dont think theres a mandate in this data for george bush 
said cbs news pollster warren mitofsky its certainly a 
comfortable victory but theres no overwhelming sentiment for what 
might be in his new presidency 
in abc news exit polling for example 45 percent of bushs 
voters said they opposed dukakis more than they supported bush in 
an even stronger gauge 14 percent of bush backers in nbcjournal 
polling gave dislike of dukakis as the primary reason for their vote 
prosperity was a bush trump card in one survey most voters said 
the economy had improved since 1980 and overwhelmingly they backed 
bush in another the economy was the mostoften cited issue in 
candidate selection and a majority of those voters took bush 
it was a pretty clear economic kind of thing epstein said 
people who said they had benefited from the reagan 
administrations economic policies voted for bush people who said 
they hadnt voted for dukakis 
other issues played in bushs favor such as his experience and 
his stands on crime and he sustained little damage from concern 
over the qualifications of his running mate sen dan quayle the 
polls found 
most striking said epstein was the increase in the number of 
voters identifying themselves as democrats in the nbcjournal poll 
31 percent said they were republicans compared to 32 percent in the 
1984 election but 38 percent said they were democrats compared to 
33 percent in 1984 
the movement in party identification did not harm reagans 
popularity about 55 percent in the cbstimes poll said they 
approved of his work as president while only about 40 percent 
disapproved the rest had no opinion 
the strongly positive rating rubbed off on bush reagan approvers 
backed him by 41 while the minority who disapproved went for 
dukakis 91 
the cbstimes abc and nbcjournal polls each involved surveys 
with more than 10000 voters leaving their polling places the 
cbstimes and abc polls had twopoint margins of error the 
nbcjournal poll three points

failed to receive a constitutionally required 75 percent approval 
from palauans the us congress before it adjourned last month 
failed to approve legislation to implement the compact 
etpison governor of palaus smallest state supports the pact 
returns from the nov 2 election showed etpison receiving 2383

third run for the presidency since the nation adopted constitutional 
government eight years ago received 2344 votes or 259 percent 
remengesau received 1761 votes or 195 percent 
four other candidates divided the rest of the vote 
there is no runoff election when a winning candidate receives 
less than a majority losing candidates have 10 days to challenge 
the outcome before the vote is officially certified 
kuniwo nakamura 45 easily won the vice presidency

everyone may be equal under the law but it 
doesnt hurt if youre the son of a famous actress who was once 
married to a us senator ask actor michael wilding 
president reagan on wednesday signed a bill to grant wilding a 
resident visa despite a drug conviction 14 years ago in wales the 
bill was sponsored by sen john warner rva who said he came to 
know and respect wilding when he was married to the actors mother 
actress elizabeth taylor 
the bill would exempt wilding the 34yearold son of miss taylor 
and the late british actor also named michael wilding from a law

a moderate earthquake shook a wide area 
of northern california on wednesday evening but there were no 
immediate reports of injury or major damage 
the us geological survey in menlo park reported a preliminary 
magnitude of 45 on the richter scale with an epicenter 11 miles 
northeast of san jose on the calaveras fault 
the temblor occurred at about the same location as a magnitude 
50 quake on june 12 which caused moderate damage 
it was just a little shaking one small shake followed by 
another one said margo gildea of oakland who studies earthquakes 
as a hobby 
although the quake was not a major one it was unusual in that it 
could be felt over such a wide distance 
the temblor was felt at least as far as 200 miles to the north in 
eureka 120 miles to the south in seaside in monterey county and 
180 miles to the east in stockton 
police in san francisco san jose and other bay area communities 
received dozens of phone calls police said they received no reports 
of injuries or major damage 
several callers to kcbs radio station in san francisco said items 
were shaken off store shelves in the san jose area 
the richter scale is a measure of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph 
each increase of one number on the scale means that the ground 
motion is 10 times greater a quake of magnitude 4 can cause 
moderate damage while one of magnitude 5 can cause considerable 
damage

george bush and michael dukakis locked together in political 
combat for so many months are going their separate ways the 
republican vice president to plan the next administration his 
vanquished democratic opponent to resume his duties as governor of 
massachusetts 
after taking the first steps toward the transfer of power next 
january bush was leaving today on a brief vacation fishing off the 
coast of florida 
the presidentelect returned to washington wednesday and received 
a tumultuous welcome at andrews air force base from supporters that 
included his vice presidentelect dan quayle 
hes going to be one of the great vice presidents bush said 
of the indiana senator who stood smiling behind him on the platform 
you watch him closely america 
back at the massachusetts statehouse dukakis told a news 
conference he was looking forward to resuming his duties as governor 
vigorously and fully 
i gave it my best shot he said of the losing campaign 
many of his fellow democrats were complaining that his best shot 
was not good enough 
the dukakis campaign ran the worst campaign of this century 
said robert slagle chairman of the texas democratic party slagle 
complained particularly about dukakis failure to respond quickly to 
attacks from the bush campaign 
you just dont let people do that sort of thing to you said 
the texas democrat 
this race was winnable said james ruvolo the ohio 
democratic party chairman michael dukakis will get a lot of 
blame deserved and not deserved 
in the presidential race bush won 40 states with 426 electoral 
votes while dukakis carried 10 states and the district of columbia 
for a total of 112 electoral votes 
but the new president will have to deal with a solidly democratic 
congress when he takes office on jan 20 a fact bush obviously had 
in mind when he told the airport crowd that im going to do 
everything i can to have a good and open and friendly relationship 
with the united states congress 
with the outcome certain from all but one race the democrats 
stood to gain one and possibly two senate seats the unsettled race 
was the contest between republican rep connie mack iii and 
democratic rep buddy mackay for the seat being vacated by florida 
sen lawton chiles 
mack had a slight lead as officials counted 100000 absentee 
ballots 
if mack wins that race the democratic majority in the senate 
would be 55 to 45 if mackay pulls it out the democrats would have 
a 5644 margin 
despite the bush victory democrats were also adding to the house 
majority with three races still too close to call the democrats 
had won 259 seats compared to 173 for the gop the democratic 
candidates held narrow leads in the three unsettled races 
only about half the eligible voters bothered to cast ballots in 
the 1988 election according to curtis gans director of the 
committee for the study of the american electorate the lowest 
turnout percentage since 1924 
we had an unprecedented number of voters who said they didnt 
like either candidate said gans 
in his valedictory press conference dukakis touched once again 
on the negative tone of the long campaign 
the republican attacks had an impact on me said dukakis 
when asked whether he thought the success of those attacks would 
result in more negative campaigning in the future he replied i 
fear that this will be a signal at the national level that this kind 
of campaigning is effective campaigning i certainly hope not 
bush moved quickly to set the transition in motion 
he announced wednesday morning that he would name old friend and 
campaign chairman james a baker iii his secretary of state baker 
served the reagan administration as white house chief of staff and 
then treasury secretary

nearly two decades after a child with a penchant 
for hiding things stashed his greatgrandmothers ashes in the 
attic a contractor renovating the house found them 
bill griffiths discovered the urn containing louisa goddens 
ashes monday in the ceiling above the front door of the home in 
suburban glen cove 
when we first saw the can we didnt know what it was when we 
saw on the label remains of we knew what it was griffith said 
wednesday 
we didnt want to throw it away on the dumpster and send it out 
to sea the contractor said i knew if it was my grandmother or 
greatgrandmother i would want to know 
griffith called the long island newspaper newsday a friend of 
james kingston who hid the urn saw the story 
kingstons grandparents lived in the house until they moved to 
alpine calif in 1977 said john kunit kingstons grandfather and 
the dead womans soninlaw 
kingston a 30yearold contractor living in alpine said he 
remembers putting the urn in the attic when he was about 11 
its a real good hiding spot he said i figured if anybody 
found it it would really shake them up 
he was always up to something when he was a kid said 
kingstons grandmother ethel kunit 
the kunits lost track of the urn after they moved kunit said he 
thought his son don had taken it with him we thought he had it 
he loved his grandmother so much and he thought we had it he 
said 
news that her mothers ashes had been found was a very big 
surprise a shock in fact mrs kunit said 
the family friend who notified the kunits has sent the urn to the 
family in california they expect to receive it soon 
kingston said he liked to leave notes about who had lived in the 
house in hiding places he also buried dead animals in cans with 
messages god only knows whats in there he said

a study has found evidence of a hereditary link 
to schizophrenia and the discovery could help scientists find new 
treatments for the disorder that strikes one person in 100 
the study published today found evidence that a single gene may 
help trigger the disease and may predispose people to a personality 
disorder that makes them loners or to other mental conditions 
thought unrelated to schizophrenia 
two other studies however found no evidence of the gene 
the researchers studied 104 members of seven families from 
iceland and great britain that had displayed multiple cases of 
schizophrenia in at least three generations 
the study included 39 schizophrenics five people with schizoid 
personality disorder and 10 people with conditions such as 
depression that are not thought related to schizophrenia it found 
that family members who apparently inherited the gene may have 
acquired an 86 percent risk of developing schizophrenia or one of 
the other disorders 
the work was done by hugh gurling of the university of london 
with colleagues there at the university of southampton in england 
at the california college of medicine in irvine and in reykjavik 
iceland 
two studies of other families have found no evidence of the 
proposed gene showing it could not be linked to all cases of 
schizophrenia researchers said 
for all we know this could be a very minor cause of 
schizophrenia that only affects some families in iceland or it 
could be a major cause said eric lander of the whitehead 
institute for biomedical research in cambridge mass 
other scientists also said the new work does not prove the gene 
exists 
lander who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study in 
todays issue of the british journal nature said such genetic 
research may help researchers split schizophrenia into distinct 
diseases that might help in finding treatments he said 
schizophrenia which includes severe distortions in perception 
speech and thoughts usually appears in adolescence or early 
adulthood a schizophrenic may believe incorrectly that he is the 
target of a plot or that his thoughts are broadcast to others 
people with schizoid personality disorder prefer to be loners 
they do not enjoy close personal relationships and say they rarely 
feel strong emotions 
genes are inherited chemical blueprints that govern the structure 
and functioning of individual cells in the body disease can result 
when a gene is damaged or some other abnormality appears in its 
functioning 
genes lie along threadlike structures called chromosomes the new 
study suggests a gene for susceptibility to schizophrenia lies 
somewhere in a particular portion of the chromosome scientists 
called number 5 
the researchers tracked the inheritance of a portion of 
chromosome 5 through the families and compared that pattern with 
the occurrence of schizophrenia and the other disorders 
results suggested that some gene in the suspected portion of 
chromosome 5 confers a susceptibility to schizophrenia the evidence 
was stronger that the gene affects not only schizophrenia but also 
schizoid personality disorder and the seemingly unrelated disorders 
gurling said in an interview 
but in his editorial lander cautioned that the statistical link 
to the seemingly unrelated orders is not overwhelming and that 
most cases in the general population are probably due to other 
causes 
the evidence linking the gene to schizophrenia alone is very 
strong but not overwhelmingly convincing said ken kidd 
professor of human genetics psychiatry and biology at the yale 
university school of medicine 
the statistical link is stronger if one considers schizoid 
personality disorder as well as schizophrenia which adds 
credibility to the gene hypothesis he said 
kidd is coauthor of a study in todays nature that found 
evidence against existence of a gene for schizophrenia in the 
chromosome portion gurling studied kidds study focused on an 
extended swedish family 
another researcher lynn de lisi of the state university of new 
york at stony brook said her work also has failed to find evidence 
for the gene gurlings paper describes 
gurlings work is just a suggestion not a definitive 
finding at this point she said

session closed slightly higher at 12410 yen opening at 12395 
yen the currency moved in a range of 1237612430 yen it closed

the nikkei stock average of 225 issues a 20551point winner 
wednesday lost 4636 points or 016 percent to close at 2816642 
foreign exchange dealers said it was difficult to feel bullish 
toward the dollar with large sell orders blocking the dollars 
potential recovery 
the dollars slide followed its sharp overnight decline on 
overseas markets stemming mainly from uncertainties toward the 
improvement of the us trade and budget deficits following bush 
victory said takamasa yamasaki with the daiwa bank 
the market had some uncertainties over bush policy before he 
actually starts his job as president he said but speculative 
investors were buying the dollar to collect profits and the dollar 
is unlikely to drop further 
yamasaki said the bank of japan had intervened intermittently in 
the markets to save the us currency from further declining 
the central bank does not comment on its activities but kyodo 
news service quoted an unidentified bank of japan source as saying 
it would take swift action to stem the yens rapid rise against the 
dollar 
it also quoted finance minister kiichi miyazawa as saying the 
yens further rise was not good and it was time for the central bank 
to intervene 
on the stock exchange bushs victory had a positive effect on 
the market but the yens rapid rise kept some investors on the 
sidelines said a dealer with a major tokyo securities firm 
speaking on condition of anonymity

nearly all the children in the historic 
gold rush town of skagway submitted to blood tests this week to 
determine if theyve been contaminated by exposure to another metal 
lead 
alarming levels of lead recently were discovered in skagways 
soil a terminal where truckloads of lead and zinc ore concentrate 
are loaded onto ships has operated at the edge of the scenic 
southeast alaskan tourist town for about 20 years 
preliminary tests showed lead levels up to 560 times the level 
naturally found in skagways soil state environmental officials 
said wednesday they had directed the terminal operator to act 
immediately to limit the powdery ores spread from the terminal 
state health officials said they will continue to take blood and 
urine samples through friday from any resident who wants to be 
tested officials have asked all pregnant women children and 
families of terminal workers to submit to the tests because they are 
most at risk of lead poisoning which can result in brain damage or 
death 
officials this week decided to take 50 urine samples from people 
in highrisk groups because exposure to some of the metals can be 
more accurately traced that way said dr michael jones of the 
alaska public health division 
by late wednesday about 150 people had been tested including 
most children of school age and younger and three pregnant women 
jones said skagway which is nearly 100 miles northwest of juneau 
has about 790 residents 
katherine kelley chief of the divisions laboratory section in 
juneau said the samples will be tested at the federal centers for 
disease control in atlanta and at a lab in massachusetts 
it sounds like its going to be about three weeks from sunday 
before we get our first inkling of what the numbers look like 
said dick stokes regional supervisor for the state department of 
environmental conservation 
the samples will be tested for lead and possibly for zinc 
mercury cadmium and other elements jones said officials last week 
said the soil tests also showed higher than normal levels of those 
elements 
stokes said the state had sent bowhead equipment co the 
terminal operator a letter ordering additional steps to limit lead 
exposure 
tractortrailer rigs carrying huge drums of lead and zinc ore 
concentrate lumber through town every 35 minutes 24 hours a day 
362 days a year from a mine at faro in canadas yukon territory 
state and federal officials and residents previously gave little 
thought to the ore the trucks tracked through the streets 
stokes said bowhead was told to strictly control access to the 
terminal which borders a ferry and cruise ship dock where thousands 
of tourists disembark each spring and summer at a town hall meeting 
last week some residents expressed concern that tourists who walk 
through the terminal have unwittingly tracked lead into town 
the letter also directs bowhead to wash trucks that become soiled 
with ore after loading or unloading and to resweep the route they 
take through town 
bowhead already had begun cleaning up the terminal site a 
1000foot section of railroad tracks where lead levels were 
extremely high is being removed and the soil will be removed for 
processing terminal manager gordon meachum said before 1982 ore 
was transported to the terminal via rail 
testing of soil well water and skagway harbor is continuing to 
determine if further cleanup is needed stokes said 
the department of environmental conservation plans to publish a 
weekly newsletter to keep residents informed of the lead problem he 
said 
kristine benson of the alaska center for the environment in 
anchorage said she and a representative of the environmental group 
sierra club will go to skagway next week to provide residents with 
information on lead contamination and legal remedies 
benson said residents asked her organization to send a 
representative because state and federal agencies had not answered 
all their questions

afghanistans prime minister has called for 
the demilitarization of his country under international supervision 
which he said could lead to a coalition government by the end of the 
soviet pullout 
the prime minister mohammad hassan sharq on wednesday also 
condemned the united states for supplying weapons to anticommunist 
guerrillas 
sharq who does not belong to afghanistans ruling communist 
party told reporters his government is earnestly hopeful the 
nowsuspended soviet withdrawal can be completed by the feb 15 
deadline set in a unmediated pact last april 
he indicated however that complete withdrawal on schedule 
depends on whether pakistan and the united states continue supplying 
arms to the antigovernment forces a practice he said violates the 
agreement 
sharq said he envisages a neutral islamic afghanistan in which 
there could be no discussion of marxism 
he said his government probably would propose a security council 
meeting to discuss how to halt arms supplies by pakistan and the 
united states to the afghan rebels sharq spoke in farsi through an 
interpreter 
at the time of the april 14 agreement the united states reserved 
the right to continue supplying the guerrillas if the soviets 
continued providing arms to afghan government forces 
last friday the soviets said they were suspending the withdrawal 
and delivering new more powerful weapons to the government because 
of continuing guerrilla attacks mig27 groundattack jets and ss1 
scud missiles have been seen in afghanistan 
on wednesday in moscow a foreign ministry spokesman said 
suspending the withdrawal from afghanistan is an attempt to ensure 
full compliance with the geneva agreement 
moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 and soviet soldiers entered afghanistan in december 1979 an 
estimated 115000 were there when the withdrawal began may 15 and 
about half have been pulled out 
the withdrawal agreement is between afghanistan and neighboring 
pakistan with the united states and soviet union signing as 
guarantors the insurgents were not party to it and have continued 
the civil war 
un officials said wednesday that no formal request for a 
security council meeting had been received and secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar was listening to views about the afghan 
situation and a possible international forum 
sharq said his government proposes an international conference 
under un auspices that would register and guarantee the neutral 
status of afghanistan and launch a program for the demilitarization 
of the country under international supervision 
sharq described by the soviets as a figure of national 
reconciliation has been meeting with un officials in new york 
but said he had not met representatives of either the united states 
or afghan insurgents 
when asked about the soviet troop withdrawal he said we are 
earnestly hopeful that with the realization of the facts concerning 
our region the foreign interference would stop and there would be 
no reason for such a delay 
he said new types of weapons were supplied to the insurgents 
after the geneva agreement was signed as soviet soldiers began to 
leave sharq declared groundtoground missiles entered 
afghanistan from the other direction 
new types of sophisticated and destructive weapons are made 
available to the enemies of peace and constitute the major 
impediment to implementation of national reconciliation he said 
asked about political ideology in a future afghanistan the 
premier said 
i assure you that my government would not let anybody propagate 
against islam or engage in any activity which would pose a threat to 
islam there could be no discussion of marxism by this government 
because the people of afghanistan are predominantly moslems and they 
would not accept any other ideology

democrats maintained their domination in the nations 
legislatures by holding republicans to small gains in state races 
and said wednesday the results strengthened their hand for the 
redistricting that will follow the 1990 census 
republicans estimated they picked up about 16 to 30 seats tuesday 
in state legislatures far fewer than in the last two presidential 
elections it also appeared that they lost control of three 
legislative chambers 
republicans gained 302 seats in 1980 and 330 seats in 1984 when 
president reagan carried state republicans on his coattails 
its a loss of epic proportions for the republicans said 
timothy dickson executive director of the democratic state 
legislative leaders association george bush didnt leave any 
fingerprint on the state legislatures 
republicans confessed to disappointment with the outcome of state 
races 
we would obviously have liked to pick up some more said 
molly gaylord a field director for the republican national 
committee she said she hoped for a strong showing in the 1990 
elections the last ones before the redistricting battles of 1991 
the number of congressional seats allocated to each state is 
shuffled every 10 years to reflect population changes through their 
control of state legislatures democrats will be able to redraw 
district lines in a way that will keep safe as many congressional 
seats as possible for members of their party 
in spite of the republicans assertion that they had gained 
seats the democrats clearly did better in the number of houses they 
controlled 
democrats made a net gain of control of one state senate and 
republicans had a net loss of control of one state house according 
to figures compiled by the associated press and the national 
conference of state legislatures 
democrats lost 10 chambers in 1980 and seven chambers in 1984 
although they won back some of them in the offyear elections of 
1982 and 1986 
the elections left democrats in control of 32 state senates and 
36 state houses while republicans controlled 16 senates and 11 
houses in some other state bodies power was evenly split nebraska 
has a nonpartisan onehouse legislature 
weve held where weve needed to hold and weve picked up seats 
where weve looked for opportunities the democrats dickson said 
but jayne victor director of the state and local department of 
the republican national committee said we maintained our power 
base in key state senates and had pickups in just about every single 
southern state 
the struggle for control of state legislatures centered on new 
mexico indiana washington state oregon vermont and montana 
the national conference of state legislatures said 25 
legislatures were controlled by democrats eight were controlled by 
republicans and nine were split between the parties results for 
other states were unavailable 
democrats took a 2616 edge to regain control of the new mexico 
senate where an even balance of 21 republicans and 21 democrats 
since 1984 had led to a shifting series of coalitions 
in indiana the home state of vice presidentelect dan quayle 
democrats picked up two seats in the house to draw even with 
republicans 50 to 50 democrats also picked up at least three seats 
in the republicancontrolled indiana senate 
republicans appeared to take control of the vermont house with 
some recounts possible the balance stood at 76 republicans and 74 
democrats in contrast to 77 democrats and 73 republicans previously 
montana republicans picked up two seats to gain a 2723 edge in 
the state senate which had been evenly divided with the democrats 
at 2525 but democrats grabbed control of the state house 5149 
the same margin by which the republicans had controlled the lower 
house 
in oregon control of the house was undecided late wednesday 
voters elected 23 democrats and 21 republicans but 16 seats were 
undecided democrats previously had a 3129 edge 
in washington state a tight senate race had republicans and 
democrats with 24 seats apiece and one district still undecided 
republicans previously had a oneseat advantage 2524 
pennsylvania democrats picked up breathing room in the state 
house where they widened their lead to 10499 from 9997 and seven 
vacancies 
in ohio republicans slightly widened their lead in the senate 
but continued to trail in the house 
among other big states democrats in texas california and 
florida maintained control of both houses and democrats in illinois 
maintained their narrow 3128 edge in the senate while keeping a big 
lead in the house 
in new york democrats remained firmly in control of the assembly 
and picked up at least one seat in the republicandominated senate

protestant and roman catholic church leaders 
from northern ireland and the irish republic ended their 
pilgrimage of hope on a note of optimism that the troubled 
british province might soon know peace 
were realizing there is no such thing as green catholic 
tears or orange protestant tears the people of ireland are 
weeping together and this is significant david bleakley 
secretary of the irish council of churches said monday 
bleakley was one of six highlevel church delegates from the four 
leading denominations of northern ireland and the republic who 
participated in a threeday ecumenical institute in this boston 
suburb 
a good seed has been planted and surely the harvest will be 
bountiful the rev james hiles of the episcopal church of our 
savior said at a news conference the church sponsored the gathering 
to mark the 90th anniversary of the churchs founding in part by 
irish immigrants 
the religious leaders also urged americans to refrain from 
sending donations to paramilitary organizations that will destroy 
our beloved island 
the most rev robin eames archbishop of irelands anglican 
church said the delegation was flatly opposed to misguided american 
donations to northern ireland whose current outbreak of political 
and sectarian violence began in 1969 
our message is pure and simple money given to paramilitary 
organizations is money for death money for misery and money for 
injury it is pushing back the chance for reconciliation and peace 
in ireland eames said 
many groups in the united states including the ireland fund 
irish northern aid committee and the ancient order of hibernians 
solicit funds for distribution in ireland none acknowledge giving 
funds for military use by factions such as the roman catholic irish 
republican army 
bleakley joined his interdominational colleagues in urging 
americans to closely monitor their donations dont take chances 
with american dollars he said weve shed tears and suffered 
because of money that has come generously from america and been used 
woefully 
the delegation also included bishop cahal b daly whose roman 
catholic diocese includes belfast the presbyterian moderator in 
ireland dr godfrey brown the rev charles eyre general secretary

in an effort to keep city residents out 
of legal doodoo dog owners are signing a pledge to use 
pooperscoopers when they take their pets into public places 
the city council has postponed a decision on a law requiring 
residents to carry the devices to see if dog owners can solve the 
problem themselves 
it is a valid complaint and im sure the dog owners of 
sausalito can do better said doug lloyd a financial and real 
estate manager who is a leader of the pledge campaign in this town 
across the golden gate bridge from san francisco 
a spirit of responsibility could take the place of any new

some editions of wednesdays ocala starbanner 
declared democrat kenneth buddy mackay the winner of floridas 
open us senate seat but like harry truman 40 years ago 
republican connie mack iii could have the last laugh 
hey buddy youre a senator read the headline on 5000 
copies of mackays hometown paper 
editors decided to use the headline at 215 am wednesday when 
mackay was ahead by 10000 votes said executive editor mark mathes 
mack later took a small lead as officials began counting the 
estimated 100000 absentee ballots the final count was not expected 
to be complete until sometime today at the earliest 
mackay made the most of the attention holding up a copy of the 
newspaper at a news conference in ocala 
ive been instructed in visual ads in this campaign mackay 
joked as he imitated harry s trumans famous pose in which he held 
up a newspaper that had incorrectly declared thomas dewey the winner 
in the 1948 race for president 
the starbanner was not alone in its early call all three 
television networks named mackay the winner shortly after 10 pm 
tuesday 
the science is not 100 percent said abc director of news 
information elise adde who said that of 68 initial projections abc 
so far has been wrong in one the maryland presidential race by 
incorrectly projecting democrat michael dukakis as the winner

a west bank human rights group has charged 
israel is trampling on education and breaking international law by 
closing palestinian schools and universities in its attempt to end 
the 11monthold uprising 
the group al haq run by palestinian and western lawyers called 
wednesday for the immediate resumption of classes for the 318000 
students in the occupied west bank 
the closure by the israeli authorities of schools and 
universities for a prolonged period of time is blatantly illegal and 
constitutes an illegitimate exercise of power by the israeli 
military the group says in a report entitled israels war 
against education 
the army ordered all primary and secondary schools in the west 
bank closed on feb 3 saying they served as centers of violent 
protest for the palestinian uprising which aims to end 21 years 
of israeli rule in the west bank and gaza strip 
most of the schools were reopened in may or june but all were 
shut down again in july authorities first said a new school year 
would begin sept 18 but still have not allowed any west bank 
schools to reopen 
universities and community colleges have been shuttered since 
january 
the human rights group formally known as al haqlaw in the 
service of man and affiliated with the genevabased international 
commission of jurists says in the 17page report that more than 
300000 children and 18000 collegeage students are missing out on 
an education 
it says the closure is illegal under both local and international 
law including the 1949 geneva convention designed to protect 
civilians in war and under military occupation 
the security rationale put forth by the government to justify 
school closing is neither supported by the facts nor the law the 
report says it is education itself that is targeted and that is 
intended as another means of penalizing the civilians living under 
occupation 
an israeli military official denied the allegations 
we didnt close schools because we dont want the palestinians 
to study the official said speaking on condition of anonymity 
each time weve tried to reopen the schools they immediately 
became again centers of violence and disorder and we had no other 
choice but to close them 
the official also hinted that the west bank schools were not 
likely to be reopened on nov 15 when the current closure order 
expires even today we dont see that the situation is ready to 
reopen the system he said 
several israeli newspapers also have reported the reopening may 
be delayed the independent hebrew daily haaretz said wednesday 
that the army saw the school shutdown as an effective means of 
pressuring the local population 
since the uprising began dec 8 at least 310 palestinians and 11 
israelis have been killed 
al haq noted that while there also have been violent protests in 
the gaza strip there have been only selective closures of schools 
there the gaza strip had 175000 students in 365 schools 
in the west bank it said all 1194 west bank schools were 
closed simultaneously without regard for activities at any specific 
institution 
it said the blanket closure order appeared designed to penalize 
the palestinian community as a whole 
by preventing palestinian students of all ages from receiving 
an education the israeli authorities are punishing present and 
future generations of palestinians the report says 
it also accuses the army of blocking home tutoring of students 
and of damaging desks and educational equipment in schools that were 
taken over temporily as military camps or detention centers

over the objections of secretary of state 
george p shultz plo chairman yasser arafat is expected to visit 
the united states later this month to address the un general 
assembly 
arab diplomats say arafat who along with two plo diplomats 
applied tuesday for a visa to come to the united nations is 
expected to announce formation of an independent palestinian state 
on about nov 30 and request un observer status for the new plo 
government 
the israeli government and jewish groups already have protested a 
visit by the palestine liberation organization chief and shultz in 
a letter made public wednesday said he did not welcome a visit by 
arafat 
shultz in a nov 1 letter to 51 senators who protested any visa 
for arafat wrote like you i have no desire whatever to see 
arafat in the united states 
the plo which has no diplomatic relations with the united 
states is the only organization that must apply for a visa through 
the general assembly 
arafat last visited the united nations in november 1974 when he 
delivered a 90minute speech 
a us mission spokeswoman anne stoddard said we do have an 
obligation to grant a visa to arafat under the usun 
headquarters agreement under that 1947 agreement the united 
states agrees to facilitate and not impede the work of diplomats and 
officials on un business 
the us government has said the plo is a terrorist organization 
and sought to close the plos un mission earlier this year 
we do not deem arafat welcome in any international forum 
said israeli mission spokesman barukh binah but the un commited 
the original sin the acceptance of the plo which is a terrorist 
organization in the first place 
the plo has never changed its covenent which still calls for 
the destruction of israel he said and has never renounced 
terrorism or accepted un resolutions 242 and 338 which 
recognize the secure borders of israel 
the plo is considered the only legitimate representative of the 
palestinian people and is invited to speak during all middle east 
debates in the general assembly and in the security council

it was largely academic but arizona voters 
overwhelmingly approved repeal of language in the state constitution 
that prohibits women from holding such state offices as governor and 
attorney general 
the states governor and school superintendnent are women and 
the provisions are considered unenforceable in any case because of 
federal law that bars discrimination 
repealed were provisions that allow only males to run for 
governor attorney general state treasurer secretary of state or 
superintendent of public instruction 
arizona voters also approved a constitutional amendment requiring 
a runoff election whenever the winning candidate for a key state 
office has failed to get 50 percent of the vote 
the proposal was inspired by controversy surrounding republican 
evan mecham who defeated democrat carolyn warner and independent 
bill schulz for governor in 1986 even though he received only 40 
percent of the vote

federal officials better stop pekin at a central illinois 
town for a place to build a prison but voters in an ohio town 
warren going to pass up a chance for a jail there according to 
votes in those two communities 
the pekin voters narrowly rejected a proposal to build a 50 
million federal prison on the communitys south side 
supporters had said the prison would provide jobs for the city of 
33500 while opponents argued the prison would mean more crime 
violence and drugs without bringing in significant new revenue or 
jobs 
in ohio the city of warren had agreed to pay for utility hookups 
to a new prison by using as much as 900000 in city tax reserves 
tuesdays initiative would have prevented the city from providing 
the hookups city officials had acknowledged that the state couldnt

a contra leader warned presidentelect george bush 
against shortcircuiting the central american peace process by 
holding direct talks with nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
if the new us administration establishes direct negotiations 
with the sandinista regime it would be violating the democratic 
aspirations of the nicaraguan people alfredo cesar said wednesday 
cesar one of seven nicaraguan rebel leaders backed by the reagan 
administration pointed to previous statements by the vice president 
that he firmly opposes consolidation of a communist regime in 
nicaragua and said bush should try to seek bipartisan support in 
congress for that policy 
cesar called for bush to work through the central american peace 
treaty signed last year by five of the regions presidents 
including daniel ortega of nicaragua rather than a bilateral 
approach 
another contra director hardline former military commander 
enrique bermudez said the struggle in nicaragua will continue 
regardless of bushs actions 
the fight is not determined by support from the united 
states bermudez said it is nicaraguans who have made the 
decision to fight by rejecting communism 
but in general contra leaders welcomed bushs election over 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis who has strongly opposed 
military aid to the rebels 
he is a loyal man contra director adolfo calero said of 
bush the american people said we are happy with the eight years 
we had under reagan and that includes definitely aid to the 
resistance 
calero said that bush unlike dukakis had sent the contras a 
letter saying he supported their struggle and charging that the 
sandinistas have violated peace agreements 
presidentelect bush has said that if the central american plan 
did not work he would definitely consider a request for military 
aid calero said the plan is not working the plan has 
practically failed 
at a postvictory news conference bush said he would continue to 
keep the pressure on the sandinistas to fulfill their 
commitments under the peace plan and said military aid to the 
contras will have a high priority 
the contras many of whom have retreated to base camps in 
honduras are receiving only humanitarian aid from the united states 
calero downplayed the importance of democratic gains in congress 
noting that some of the new democratic senators such as charles s 
robb of virginia and joseph i lieberman of connecticut supported 
the contras during the campaign

planned parenthood officials hoped an antiabortion ballot 
measure approved in arkansas would not affect availabilty of some 
contraceptives and prochoice activists vowed to fight bans on 
state abortion funding in michigan and colorado 
michigan health officials wednesday reluctantly prepared to 
implement a ban on taxfunded abortions for poor women that received 
overwhelmingly approval from voters the day before 
i think its a step backward for public policy in this state to 
deny health care access for one group of people the very poor 
said c patrick babock director of the michigan department of 
social services 
antiabortion forces spent 23 million to persuade voters to 
retain a 1987 law ending state payments for abortions except when 
the mothers life is in danger the prochoice side was outspent by 
31 
the ban won by 5743 percent 
the state spends about 58 million a year for some 18600 
abortions for lowincome women 
babcock said he knew of no way to delay implementation of the 
measure but a spokeswoman for a prochoice group said it will look 
for one 
surely there are some options said judith frey of the 
peoples campaign for choice 
barbara listing chairwoman of the committee to end taxfunded 
abortions said the group will make certain the ban takes effect and 
try to persuade lawmakers to spend the abortion funds on programs to 
help women through crisis pregnancies 
in colorado supporters and opponents of a referendum on a state 
law banning abortion funding said the vote didnt end the debate 
im not so naive to think this is a mandate on abortion said 
william woodley who led the fight to uphold the ban but when the 
voters understood the issue they realized they didnt want their 
tax dollars paying for abortion 
the measure to repeal the ban was defeated 60 percent to 40 
percent a margin that surprised even the victors 
four years ago the colorado constitution was amended to prohibit 
state abortion funding exceptions include cases where the life of 
the pregnant woman or unborn child is endangered and when every 
reasonable effort has been made to preserve the life of each 
ed zorenski spokesman for the defeated amendment campaign said 
his side will rebuild and bring it back again 
arkansas measure approved by 5248 percent bars state funding 
of abortions unless the mothers life is in danger it also says 
state policy is to protect unborn children starting at 
conception another section states that contraceptives are not 
affected by its provisions 
however planned parenthood of greater arkansas expressed fear 
that the amendment could be construed to prevent use of the 
morningafter pill which works after conception even in cases 
of rape or incest 
were asking our opponents to stick to their promises to 
respect contraceptives and birth control and to not make those 
things illegal so we will have nowhere to go said chris 
charbonneau the chapters executive director 
jerry cox executive director of the unborn child amendment 
committee said we have no interest in the morningafter pill 
cox said opponents vastly outspent his group planned parenthood 
said it spent about 100000 
arkansas currently does not fund abortions 
dr john c wilke head of the national right to life committee 
exulted over the ballotquestion results 
this is an honest view of what the public thinks about 
abortion funding he said 
eleanor smeal president of the prochoice fund for a feminist 
majority said the battleground now shifts to the federal level to 
block the overturning of the 1973 supreme court ruling that 
legalized abortion 
it isnt going to end until a small minority stops forcing its 
way on the rest of us she said 
before tuesdays election prochoice advocates had lost only one 
of 22 state and local referendums nationwide 
thirtyseven states refuse to fund abortions for the poor

the purdy school board reluctantly agreed to 
break its centuryold ban on school dances in time for a december 
homecoming but members are still hoping an appeals court will 
reinstate the prohibition 
carolyn flummerfelt a parent who has been fighting for students 
trying to stage their first school dance said she has waited a long 
time to hear the board grant approval 
its finally happened she said its nice that our high 
school students get to do what other high school students do 
the six board members unanimously voted wednesday to suspend the 
ban until an appeals court makes a ruling on us district judge 
russell clarks order 
in his ruling in august clark said the district must stop 
enforcing the dance ban because it unconstitutionally promoted the 
values of purdy residents who opposed dancing for religious reasons 
board members appealed clarks order but last week the 8th us 
circuit court of appeals denied their request that the order not be 
enforced until the appeal was settled 
we must obey the order of judge clark even though we disagree 
with it schools superintendent sheldon buxton told the board 
members 
ransom ellis iii the attorney representing the school board 
stressed that the suspension was temporary 
the rule is really still on the books but the application and 
enforcement are suspended he said 
only one student purdy high school student body president nancy 
fox attended the brief meeting at which the dance ban was 
suspended miss fox said school administrators had cooperated as she 
and other students planned a dec 10 homecoming dance 
our administration has been very willing to help and work with 
us she said 
the purdy school system centered in a town of about 900 people 
50 miles southwest of springfield has about 160 students in its 
high school

civil war has reduced sudans south 
to a graveyard in the most appalling human tragedy in the world 
for many years a british overseas development minister says 
christopher patten who just returned from a twoday trip to the 
vast refugee camps sudanese have fled to in western ethiopia said 
he had been told the overland route to the camps is littered with 
corpses or bones of corpses 
he estimated at least half the refugees die during the journey 
which can take four months and appealed to the international 
community to press for peace and stability in the rebelplagued 
region of southern sudan which has been turned into a graveyard 
in the last two years 
the physical condition of the sudanese refugees in the camps in 
western ethiopia graphically authenticates the appalling experience 
of those who had managed to cross the border for a haven in 
ethiopia patten said wednesday 
in the past year the camps populations have tripled to more 
than 330000 as the sudan peoples liberation army has intensified 
its war against sudans moslem government the rebels took up arms 
in 1983 seeking greater autonomy and social and economic reforms for 
the predominantly christian and animist south 
patten urged the rebels to allow relief agencies to deliver 
humanitarian aid to southern sudan where the rebels claim to 
control 95 percent of the countryside and towns 
in september the rebels ambushed a convoy transporting relief 
supplies and killed seven kenyan truck drivers 
the killing caused kenyan drivers to boycott entering southern 
sudan as a result more than 1200 tons of emergency supplies from 
the un world food program were stranded in uganda sudans 
southern neighbor 
a world foodsponsored airlift of supplies started oct 26 and 
continues 
the rebels also repeatedly have threatened to shoot down aircraft 
military or commercial that fly over southern sudan in 1986 and 
1987 the rebels downed two commercial airplanes killing 73 people 
at least two large cargo jets have been hit this year but landed 
safely 
patten also visited camps in eastern ethiopia that hold about 
350000 somalis the refugees started arriving in may fleeing 
fighting between the rebel somali national movement and government 
troops 
patten said their physical condition was much better than that of 
the sudanese refugees but water was scarce in the region and had to 
be trucked to them over poor roads 
the ministry of overseas development is responsible for all 
british aid to third world countries

sen lowell p weicker jr bid an 
emotional farewell to public life conceding defeat in his attempt 
to win a fourth term and vowing never to return to politics after 
his first loss in 26 years 
i always said to myself when your time comes walk off that 
field no regrets no excuses no blaming no griping no comebacks 
walk off weicker 57 said wednesday tears in his eyes 
the liberal republican lost his seat in a razorthin upset 
tuesday by attorney general joseph i lieberman a conservative 
democrat 
family friends and campaign supporters gathered at greenwich 
town hall the day after for what weicker described as his farewell 
appearance 
here is where it began he said here is where it ends 
weicker heir to the squibb pharmaceutical fortune began his 
political career in this exclusive southern connecticut town in 1962 
as a state representative he won election to the house in 1968 and 
the senate two years later 
weicker gained national prominence for early and sharp criticism 
of the nixon administration during the watergate scandal and later 
as a chief opponent of president reagans conservative social agenda 
he became one of the most successful republicans ever in 
democratdominated connecticut by stressing his independence and 
refusal to toe the party line 
but that maverick streak helped lead to his ouster as many 
conservative republicans following the lead of national review 
editor william f buckley jr backed the democratic challenger 
weicker whose career was highlighted by his stinging rhetoric 
and love of a good fight refused to place the blame on anyone but 
himself 
im a big guy i take care of myself i take shots ive given 
shots he said im responsible for last nights results 
official totals gave lieberman 688494 votes or 4976 percent 
to 678442 or 4904 percent for weicker secretary of state julia 
tashjian said in hartford late wednesday two thirdparty candidates 
shared the rest of the vote 
tashjian said the 10052vote margin represented connecticuts 
tightest statewide election since an attorney generals contest in 
1970 but not close enough to order a recount 
i didnt lose this race by a few thousand votes in my mind and 
in my heart i lost it by 100000 this wasnt a close race 
weicker said calling the result a clear mandate by the people of 
the state of connecticut and attributing it to support of 
liebermans positions and opposition to his 
lieberman said the outcome reflected the voters desire for 
change and a desire for an advocate for the state which of course 
is what ive been as attorney general environment consumers 
jobs housing drugs 
weicker repeatedly stressed that he would not seek the gop 
gubernatorial nomination in 1990 or any other public office 
including a post in the new bush administration 
he said he would focus on family and friends and his passion for 
sports and marine science and said he might choose an academic 
career 
weicker said he had no regrets about his legislative career and 
was proud of his accomplishments especially his fights against 
school prayer antibusing proposals and other constitutional issues 
that nobody else would touch with a 10foot pole during the 
reagan years 
not one word of that constitution is different today than when 
i walked out on the senate floor 18 years ago he said 
thank you connecticut for giving me the opportunity that any 
other person would dream of and goodbye

lives is often lined with cars bearing people who sit and stare at 
the bush compound many locals say they fear those crowds will grow 
im a little leery because i dont know what costs the town 
will incur winters said every bus tour that comes into 
southern maine will swing into town but still theres a sense of 
pride in him a feeling its our town that could be the center of 
attention

36foot banner to hang across dock square when the bushes return to 
town 
welcome home the banner says george our president and 
barbara our first lady our hopes and prayers are with you

police rushed out 400 officers today to investigate 
a series of attacks in a residential zone east of tokyo in which six 
children as young as age 2 have been stabbed in the stomach 
kaichi sato of the chiba prefectural police said a police 
helicopter was also flown over residential areas 21 miles east of 
tokyo to broadcast warnings to children not to walk alone on city 
streets 
the steppedup police effort came after a twoyearold boy was 
stabbed by a man with a sharp object while playing alone on a street 
in front of his house wednesday 
an hour later another 3yearold boy was also stabbed by an 
unknown assailant while playing alone about two miles away sato 
said 
known for its relatively low crime rate japan had 1291 cases of 
reported crime per 100000 people last year compared to 5480 cases 
in the united states figures from the national police agency show 
those attacked were all young children their description 
of an assailant was so vague sato said 
he said at least four similar cases were reported in a nearby 
town and cities in neighboring saitama prefecture just north of 
tokyo since last month in each case children were stabbed in the 
stomach while playing alone police said 
crimes against children in japan while rare have grabbed 
headlines whenever such incidents occur 
in one such case in september 1987 the body of a 5yearold boy 
was found naked in a river bed two days after he was kidnapped and 
an anonymous telephone caller demanded 161000 ransom the case 
remains unsolved

a jail riot sparked by racial tensions 
between blacks and hispanics who were crammed into a cell block six 
times too small left 17 prisoners injured one critically 
authorities said 
about 150 men in a cell block designed to hold 24 fought with 
each other for 20 minutes wednesday night with weapons made from mop 
handles window shards disassembled bunk beds and sharpened plastic 
spoons sheriffs department spokeswoman liz foster said 
we had darn near everybody in the cell block fighting at one 
point said benny mclaughlin commander of the el cajon detention 
facility they just got tired out and after 20 minutes of 
fighting they started looking for cover 
deputies inside the jail do not carry guns so they had to wait 
until the inmates quit fighting before they could enter the cell 
block and restore order mclaughlin said 
the two most seriously injured prisoners were flown to university 
of californiasan diego medical center one was in critical 
condition with head injuries suffered in a 14foot fall from the 
cell blocks upper tier to the concrete floor 
the other was in serious but stable condition with a stab wound 
to the neck neither of their identities was immediately available 
seven other prisoners were injured seriously but the nature of 
their injuries wasnt immediately available officials said no 
guards were injured foster said 
the fight began when inmates were watching television and milling 
around outside their seventhfloor cells during a recreation period 
mclaughlin said 
each of the 45squarefoot cells in the block houses an average 
of nine inmates so they have been allowed to gather in a common 
recreation area until 10 pm each night mclaughlin said 
it was the third apparently racially motivated brawl between 
blacks and hispanics at the san diego county jail in the past five 
months mclaughlin said 
the jail was designed for 120 inmates but usually houses more 
than 700 because of a countywide shortage of jail space and a 
courtimposed inmate cap at the central jail in downtown san diego 
were going to be moving some bodies around to different jails 
tonight sheriffs dispatcher kathy wilder said

a chinese seismologist estimated today that more 
than 1000 people were killed in the earthquake that struck a 
heavily forested and remote mountain region of southwestern china 
last weekend 
rescue workers meanwhile were reported still trying to reach 
isolated areas that may have been badly hit by chinas worst 
earthquake in 12 years 
chen yong deputy director of the state seismological bureau 
provided the official xinhua news agency with the death estimate 
the agency also quoted him as saying more than 80 percent of the 
houses in the stricken area near chinas border with burma had 
collapsed 
chen said most of the houses in the region inhabited mainly by 
ethnic minority groups were made of bamboo and wood 
earlier the civil affairs ministry said 938 people were killed 
in sundays temblor which measured 76 on the richter scale 
xinhua said 699 bodies had been recovered in the lancang area of 
southern yunnan province at the epicenter staterun beijing radio 
reported 1986 people injured 
but the extent of the disaster remained unclear because of the 
remoteness of the region and heavy damage to communications and 
transportation links 
yunnan provincial official li weijin said today that rescue 
workers were still trying to reach isolated mountain pockets where 
people may have been hurt or killed 
seismologist chen based his casualty estimate on the geographic 
conditions of the stricken area and comparisons with other 
catastrophic quakes including a 1976 quake that killed 242000 in 
the northeast china city of tangshan 
beijing radio on wednesday said rescue teams were being forced to 
trek on foot through heavily forested mountain terrain to reach some 
villages the village of zhanmapo believed the worst hit with 297 
dead was accessible only by a footpath that was blocked by a 
landslide 
the richter scale records ground motion in an earthquake as 
measured by seismographs a tremor of 60 is capable of causing 
considerable destruction in a populated area and a quake measuring 
70 is 10 times as powerful 
sundays quake of 76 was the most deadly since the 1976 tangshan 
tremor which measured 78 on the richter scale as of wednesday 
morning there had been 184 aftershocks and chen said aftershocks 
would continue for about two months

chubb corp has agreed to pay 48 million to 
settle a lawsuit filed on behalf of about 8000 farmers in 10 states 
whose applications for drought insurance were denied by the insurer 
chubb said it would deposit 481 million with the us district 
court here early next week as part of the outofcourt settlement 
reached wednesday 
this means the farmers are going to get 100 cents on the dollar 
and not have to pay any attorney fees said stanley chesley the 
lead attorney in the classaction suit 
chesley said the interest on the deposited money also would go to 
the farmers us district judge carl rubin has said that hearings 
may be held in the 10 states for farmers who want to be heard 
further 
the final agreement will be submitted to rubin who had suggested 
the two sides seek an agreement 
chubb said in a statement it decided to settle for several 
reasons it said that in october when the case was being prepared 
for trial there was evidence which substantially affected chubbs 
ability to pursue the defense of this litigation 
chubb said that evidence included testimony of witnesses 
indicating that officials of good weather international which 
served as agents in selling the insurance had acted contrary to 
chubbs specific instructions in several material respects this 
newly discovered evidence dictated that chubb pursue a settlement 
rather than protracted and costly litigation 
officials of jericho nybased good weather international 
declined to comment until they had seen a copy of chubbs statement 
and the settlement the wall street journal reported today 
chesley said he will ask that chubbs records for the drought 
insurance be audited and that the court appoint a master to invest 
and pay out the money 
the lawsuit was scheduled for trial jan 3 before rubin 
the farmers alleged that chubb based in warren nj unfairly 
denied them insurance against crop damage caused by this years 
severe drought 
chubb began rejecting payments in the middle of the year when it 
said that brokers sold more coverage than planned chubb lawyers 
said the company was prepared to sell about 40 million in coverage 
but brokers had sold more than 300 million 
chubb said the 48 million should be enough to cover anticipated 
payments to farmers who didnt receive policies as well as 
expenses attorneys fees and other distributions determined by 
rubin 
the farmers will receive amounts equal to the losses that would 
have been covered if they had been policy holders minus what the 
premiums would have cost and any goodwill payments already made to 
them by chubb the company said 
chubb spokeswoman gail devlin said last week that the company had 
made 11 million in goodwill payments to drought insurance 
applicants and planned no additional payments 
the lawsuit was filed on behalf of farmers in ohio kentucky 
indiana tennessee illinois minnesota michigan missouri iowa 
and wisconsin

students will regain extracurricular 
activities and a previously forfeited basketball season could be 
salvaged because voters approved a property tax levy that had failed 
in six previous elections 
residents of this village 10 miles south of youngstown voted 
17911627 on tuesday to approve a fiveyear emergency operating 
levy that was the largest of the 233 school tax issues on ohio 
ballots 
more people came out to vote and i know some people 
switched said school superintendent roger stiller i think they 
realized that not only was our school district in trouble but that 
a lot of other districts were in trouble 
its back to picking up the pieces but were glad to be 
picking them up stiller said 
james meissner who coached the columbiana high school boys 
basketball team until athletics were canceled this year said former 
players asked him whether the 350student school could have a team 
this year 
that was their first question after the vote meissner said 
winter sports boys and girls basketball and wrestling 
depends on numbers of players and whether we can get enough 
games to have a meaningful season he said the coach said the 
school gave up its league schedule after a levy proposal failed in 
august it was the sixth straight failure of a tax proposal 
students said they were left with little to do after a budget 
deficit projected at 425000 this year forced officials to cut all 
extracurricular activities and some elective classes 
players from columbianas former league champion football team 
transferred this year to neighboring districts so they could 
continue playing stiller said one student left recently so he 
could play basketball in a neighboring district 
the new columbiana levy which starts in january is expected to 
raise 875000 a year stiller said new revenues in the remainder 
of the school year will be used to repay 215000 the district 
borrowed from banks and the state to cover this semesters shortfall

father vincent to walk free with immunity while rosier is on trial 
i dont think its fair for anyone to be on trial for this 
case delman testified adding that he didnt want to see his

drugs were administered delman said 
if i had the guts id put a pillow over her face delman

her bedroom early in the morning of jan 15

dentist took matters in his own hands and smothered her by placing 
his hands over her nose and mouth she died 10 minutes later delman 
said 
delman told the jury he would have lied about his fathers part 
if they hadnt been given immunity 
but assistant state attorney ed volz questioned why rosier had 
called vincent delman after the television interview to warn him of 
possibile liability if rosier didnt know he had smothered his wife

a moderate earthquake shook a wide 
section of northern california knocking items off grocery shelves 
but causing no injuries or major damage 
the quake wednesday night had a magnitude of 47 on richter 
scale according to the university of california at berkeley 
seismographic stations the us geological survey in menlo park 
gave a preliminary reading of 45 with an epicenter 11 miles 
northeast of san jose on the calaveras fault 
most who felt the quake described it as two sharp jolts but said 
it was not frightening 
at the alpha beta supermarket in san jose kitchen items jar 
lids and a can fell off the shelves said clerk mike depiro 
it was shaking rattling and rumbling he said i was 
bagging groceries and i heard things start rumbling and falling so 
i paid attention i just enjoyed it 
the 908 pm temblor occurred at about the same location as did 
a magnitude 50 quake june 12 that quake caused slight damage 
wednesdays quake was felt in an area stretching at least 200 
miles to the north of san francisco in eureka 120 miles to the 
south in seaside in monterey county and 120 miles to the east in 
modesto 
police in san francisco san jose and several other bay area 
communities reported dozens of phone calls about the temblor but 
none received reports of structural damage or injuries 
the richter scale is used to describe the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph 
each increase of one number on the scale means that the ground 
motion is 10 times greater a quake of magnitude 4 can cause 
moderate damage while one of magnitude 5 can cause considerable 
damage

action against violent demonstrations but he said he did not know 
how many people were killed or injured he spoke on condition of 
anonymity in keeping with regulations 
in colombo heavily armed security troops stood guard as three 
people formally declared their candidacy for president of this 
island wracked by war and crippled by civil unrest and strikes 
no demonstrations were reported in colombo 
but in the tangalle tissmaharama and monaragala districts south 
and east of colombo demonstrators defied aroundtheclock curfews 
police in colombo said at least five people were killed in each of 
the districts they said 
security troops on wednesday were issued shootonsight orders in 
case of demonstrations against the government state radio said 
in colombo soldiers in armored cars blocked roads leading to the 
town hall as nomination papers were presented for the dec 19 
presidential election about 1000 police with automatic weapons 
watched as election commissioner chanchrananda de silva accepted the 
documents

leader of the opposition sri lanka freedom party prime minister 
ramasinghe premadasa candidate of the ruling united national party 
and ossie abeygoonesekera representing the threeparty united 
socialist alliance 
president junius r jayewardene who has governed since 1977 is 
prohibited by law from seeking another term and has said he will 
step down after a successor is sworn in 
but a sinhalese extremist group is demanding he resign before the 
elections charging the current government is incapable of 
conducting fair elections the peoples liberation front wants 
parliament dissolved and a caretaker government set up to oversee 
the balloting 
the front pressed its demands on monday by launching a fourday 
strike that shut down businesses throughout much of the island 
resulted in shortages of food and fuel and prompted thousands of 
foreign tourists to cut short vacations 
the front opposes the governments peace overtures to end a 
5year tamil insurgency that has claimed more than 8500 lives the 
government blames the front for the deaths of more than 550 people 
most of them sinhalese supporters of the government 
the front says jayewardene who is sinhalese has offered too 
many concessions to the tamil ethnic minority 
most sinhalese are buddhists while most tamils are hindus 
this weeks strike has closed most shops and banks prices for 
some food mostly fruit and vegetables have skyrocketed as much as 
300 percent 
troops have been posted throughout the capital soldiers have 
been driving public buses and distributing fuel to state gasoline 
stations where motorists wait up to five hours in line and the navy

despite the warning more than 70 percent of the employees failed 
to show up for their shifts officials said 
security forces received orders wednesday to shoot anyone 
demonstrating against the government no such demonstrations were 
reported nighttime curfews were imposed 
the strike also disrupted the islands tourist industry which 
this year reported an increase for the first time since ethnic 
violence flared in 1983 
about 9000 tourists were evacuated tuesday from the south coast 
where most resorts are located after the front told the hotels to 
close or face attacks

from west germany switzerland and scandinavia and more flights were 
planned tour operators said 
asker moosajee chairman of the state ceylon tourist board said 
the government had advised foreign tour groups the country was 
facing shortages and unsettled political conditions 
we have not told foreigners to leave the country but if people 
are scared theres not much we can do he said we have advised 
tour groups that curfews and shortages may make the packages they 
are offering below standard

a court has awarded 3 million to a woman 
who was shot and paralyzed from the neck down by a paroled inmate 
ruling that the parole board members who voted to free the prisoner 
were negligent 
linda grantham 47 sued the three members of the state parole 
board that voted to release clem jimpson in 1984 just five weeks 
after his release to a halfway house in january 1985 jimpson shot 
grantham in the parking lot of a jackson bank 
wednesdays verdict by a circuit court jury was made possible by 
a state supreme court ruling last may that grantham had the right to 
sue the board members two years earlier a judge dismissed the 
litigation saying members were immune under state law because they 
had acted in their official capacity 
during the threeday trial that began monday district attorney 
ed peters testified that a state form asking if jimpson should be 
paroled had arrived after he was freed 
the jury deliberated five hours before awarding grantham 25 
million in actual damages and 500000 in punitive damages the suit 
had asked for 4 million 
grantham praising the verdict said that while nothing can 
replace what ive lost if it can change the system itll all be 
worthwhile 
deputy attorney general robert gibbs called the jurors decision 
very disappointing 
they were not to consider whether jimpson should have been 
paroled he said they were to determine whether the parole 
board was grossly negligent 
gibbs warned the verdict could set a dangerous precedent 
any agency any employer anybody who works for the state of 
mississippi will be affected he said if they make any 
decision they will have to pay for it 
exactly who would pay the damages remains uncertain 
gibbs said that if the state loses on appeal he will ask the 
legislature to cover any damages required to be paid individually by 
board members james figgs ollie sykes and paul carter 
at the time of his parole jimpson was serving a life sentence 
for the murder of a jackson convenience store clerk the 60yearold 
is now serving a sentence of life without parole for shooting

a boys football coach whose 
powerhouse team rolled to an undefeated season has been fired for 
allowing his players to pile on the points 
jim donnelly was dismissed wednesday as offensive coordinator for 
the chiefs a team of boys 10 to 12 years old whose 90 record 
included such lopsided scores as 320 220 328 and 288 
palm beach county youth league rules say that after a 17point 
lead the winning team has to ease up to keep from demoralizing its 
opponents 
because most of the chiefs points came in the first quarter the 
best players would have had to sit on the bench most of the game 
and donnelly said that was not fair 
im not in favor of running up the score but i dont see 
anything wrong with a shutout he said 
donnelly said he was suspended monday when he refused orders from 
league management to allow an opposing team to score 12 points he 
was dismissed two days later 
quarterback michael healy 12 who engineers the teams triple 
reverses and sophisticated wishbone attack said he sees nothing 
wrong with punishing his opponents 
football is supposed to be a mean sport he said thats 
what the game of football is all about you shouldnt be punished 
because youre good

a chicago museum today returned an 
ancient stone carving to thailand more than 20 years after it 
disappeared from a temple 
the carving of a hindu god arrived aboard a flight from chicago 
and was to be placed at the phnom rong temple in the northeastern 
province of buri ram 
the carving the birth of brahma with reclining vishnu on a 
makara disappeared from the temple in the 1960s it was bought by 
a dealer in bangkok who sold it to a new york dealer who sold it 
to the alsdorf foundation the foundation donated it to the art 
institute of chicago 
thailand has sought its return for 15 years and government 
officials held sensitive talks with the art institute this year the 
institute said this week it was donating the 1000yearold carving 
to thailand so the restoration of phnom rong temple could be 
completed 
the issue took on nationalistic tones when government officials 
and the media accused the united states of bullying its friend in 
southeast asia 
earlier this year virtually all thai newspapers ran an open 
letter calling on americans to help return the carving 
some thais said the carving had been stolen by the united 
states however experts privately concede that many priceless art 
objects are smuggled out of the country through the help of corrupt 
government officials

damaged a military housing complex at campsie four miles outside 
the north coast city of londonderry police said 
the ira gave a warning 30 minutes before the blast and the area 
was quickly evacuated but two policemen were treated for shock and 
a soldier sustained cuts police said 
on wednesday in a statement circulated to irish media the ira 
took responsibility for the bombing and said we now warn all 
military personnel that they must remove their families from the 
occupied north of ireland 
married quarters have not been a target of the ira in recent 
years in the outlawed organizations campaign to rid northern 
ireland of british rule and unite it with the irish republic 
but the statement said all army housing estates or similar 
identifiable areas henceforward will be liable to attack

remember she said but we do remember how can we forget 
those who did not suffer through kristallnacht must not forget

the maker of an electronic hairremoval system 
made false and misleading claims that the device could permanently 
eliminate unwanted hair the federal trade commission ruled 
the decision made public wednesday upholds a 1987 
administrative law judges ruling against removatron international 
corp 
the commission issued an order prohibiting the company from 
making false and misleading claims requiring it to inform past 
purchasers of the product about the ruling and ordering it to place 
labels on its products stating that it has no proof that its 
machines produce anything other than temporary hair removal 
the company sells devices called removatron that use tweezers 
to remove hairs while at the same time transmitting radio waves to 
the hair roots it has claimed that this process eventually destroys 
the hair root tissue and prevents future growth 
the machines which cost about 4000 each are sold to beauty 
salons and other businesses which offer hairremoval service to 
customers 
under terms of the order the company must halt its claims unless 
it can produce competent and reliable scientific evidence that 
the machines will work

scientists wont be able to move into a new 23 
million government laboratory until at least next year because of 
problems with a ventilation system designed to keep deadly viruses 
from escaping officials said 
they want to be sure before they clear a system like that for 
people like me to crawl under a hood and begin working with a hot 
virus said dr thomas fowlkes director of the centers for 
disease controls retrovirus laboratory 
viruses that will be studied at the lab include those causing 
aids and lassa fever which has been responsible for epidemics of 
hemorrhagic fever in nigeria 
ribbon cutting at the building was last month but the 
ventilationsystem problems have delayed occupancy by an estimated 
80 researchers officials said 
the ventilation system is designed to keep air pressure inside 
the buildings 12 laboratories slightly below normal so that air 
from the hallways always flows into the labs to keep microbes from 
being carried out 
steve white the cdc engineer responsible for operating the air 
system said the problems involve the 96 pneumatic control units 
whose delicate sensors and valves measure and adjust air pressure 
throughout the building 
for unknown reasons changes in air pressure such as those 
caused by an open door throw the gauges out of adjustment

a man convicted two years ago for landing a small 
plane on the champs elysees had his pilots license suspended today 
for three years for flying 1000 feet over paris on a bet 
albert maltret also was fined 8300 for violating civil aviation 
regulations for a low pass he made over the champs elysees on oct 
13 
maltrets attorney jean yves lienart denied his 52yearold 
client is the black baron a pilot who for months evaded french 
police while making midnight flights over paris rooftops french 
newspapers had speculated that maltret was the elusive pilot 
maltret told the court he had been a pilot for 31 years and a 
flight instructor for 24 years in france morocco libya bangladesh 
and gabon 
i just love aviation so much that i could not resist a bet 
proposed to me by some friends he said in his own defense 
jean zamponi president of the court responded monsieur 
maltret do you believe that a 52yearold man should behave like a 
man of 20 and not resist a bet of this type 
lienart compared his clients stunt to grand prix driver alain 
prost racing on an empty public street saying it was a violation 
of the rules but it was not a danger 
maltret said he had made contingency plans in the event of 
trouble during the flight that included landing his rented rallye ms 
880 moranesaulnier aircraft on the seine river he told the court 
he was sorry and promised never again to perform such a stunt 
the air and border police arrested maltret oct 13 shortly after 
his afternoon landing at a private airfield in the paris suburb of 
st cyr 
lienart argued that his client should not be punished for the 
publicity surrounding the unexplained summer flights he pointed out 
that maltret flew during daylight hours in an identifiable plane 
while the black baron is night discretion mystery 
the summer flights captured the imagination of the french public 
and the media dubbed the pilot the black baron in a twist on the 
nickname of germanys world war i flying ace the red baron on the 
night of aug 13 police helicopters chased the plane but were 
unable to catch it 
maltret said he was proud of his 1986 escapade in which he landed 
his small plane on the most beautiful boulevard in the world 
maltret had his pilots license suspended for the champs elysees 
landing an amnesty covering minor offenses enacted this summer as 
is traditional after french presidential elections had allowed 
maltret to recover his license

in the ashes of a lost democratic presidential 
campaign jesse jackson heads toward the next one strengthened by 
new rules and a new role 
next time jackson will begin as the democrat to beat which is 
what somebody almost certainly will do the odds weigh heavily 
against the nomination of a black man in 1992 in a party that at 
times shrank from the word liberal during the campaign just 
ended 
jackson said he doesnt fear that a liberal cant be elected 
reaching out making room thats liberalism so the liberal 
tradition is a proud tradition he said i will not forsake it 
there surely will be ample competition with democratic names 
like bradley cuomo nunn gore and gephardt and more on the early 
list of possible entries for 1992 even as gov michael dukakis 
conceded his loss to presidentelect bush his supporters were 
chanting ninetytwo ninetytwo 
whatever the field the standing jackson won in 1988 and the 
rules concessions he gained from dukakis at the democratic national 
convention will make him more formidable next time for a while 
republicans tried to bill him as a virtual third partner in the 
dukakisbentsen ticket he was a major nationallytelevised 
performer at the atlanta convention 
jackson is aware of the perils as well as its advantages of his 
enhanced political station hes been talking with friends and 
advisers about the way to deal with both 
the first step already has been taken it was a late campaign 
sprint in behalf of dukakis with it jackson guarded against any 
fingerpointing suggesting that hed done less than his best for the 
democratic ticket 
he said hed put in more miles registered more voters than 
anyone else in support of dukakis by election night his voice was 
hoarse and fading from the campaign strain as he said it was much 
too early to talk about 1992 politics 
i have not yet made that decision not even given it serious 
consideration he said that at least is the public posture 
jackson also said the new political season began on wednesday 
pointing to city elections in 1989 offyear elections in 1990 the 
census and congressional reapportionment in 1991 theres a lot to 
do a lot of meaningful work and i intend to be involved right in 
the heart of it said jackson 
that involvement flows inexorably toward a third quest for the 
democratic presidential nomination in 1992 jacksons voter 
registration efforts for the dukakis ticket will pay him dividends 
too his political action committee keep hope alive fits the same 
pattern 
an initial test of his strength in party councils will come early 
next winter when the democratic national committee elects a new 
chairman or extends the tenure of paul kirk who had planned to 
leave the post but may stay on temporarily for the sake of party 
peace 
ron brown a washington lawyer jacksons convention manager and 
a volunteer adviser to dukakis expects to seek the chairmanship at 
least four other democrats are prospective candidates 
while jackson isnt saying so yet he will be at work for brown 
jackson allies were named to about a dozen atlarge committee seats 
as part of a harmony pact with dukakis at the democratic convention 
in atlanta one of the new committeemen jesse jackson jr 
more important delegate selection rules have been amended to 
jacksons potential advantage in 1992 in a convention peacemaking 
deal with jackson the dukakis camp agreed to rules that will award 
future nominating votes strictly on the basis of proportional 
representation of the popular vote 
in simplest terms that reduces the convention clout of 
officeholders and party leaders who are not pledged to a candidate 
in advance tying the outcome more tightly than ever to the 
presidential primaries another step in that direction was a cut in 
the number of socalled super delegates democratic governors 
members of congress and others who got nominating votes with no 
strings and no instructions that bloc was cut to about 10 percent 
of the delegate total 
in atlanta jackson complained that his delegate strength did not 
match his percentage of the primary and caucus vote the new rules 
will change that unless the democratic establishment wants to risk 
a major battle with the partys premier black leader by trying to 
amend them again 
in kinder gentler political times the defeated nominee of a 
party was considered its titular leader until the next campaign and 
dukakis said wednesday that he will provide whatever leadership i 
can in the interest of democratic unity 
but presidential campaigning has become all but permanent and 
defeated candidates go offstage quickly the new democratic cast 
will be auditioning before long 
and jackson will be looking for a lead role our charge today 
is to learn well the lessons from this campaign and build upon it as 
the vision for the next campaign he has said 
not lately he made that observation last summer at the atlanta 
convention before the general election campaign for the white house 
even began

the soviet ambassador to china said today that a 
summit next year between the nations leaders will not dramatically 
change sovietchinese relations because they already are normal 
oleg troyanovsky speaking to the foreign correspondents club of 
beijing said chinese foreign minister qian qichen will go to moscow 
on dec 1 to set the stage for the first sinosoviet summit in 30 
years 
china and the soviet union have entered an important new phase 
in their relations he said of the longtime adversaries one 
can say that our relations with china are normal so perhaps it 
would be more correct to speak not about normalization but about 
further development 
china split with the soviet union over ideological differences in 
1960 and fought a brief border war with the soviets in 1969 
troyanovsky echoed chinese statements that the end of feuding 
between the two countries will not mean a return to the relationship 
of the 1950s when moscow dominated the communist world 
sovietchinese trade and other nonofficial contacts have 
increased since the early 1980s but china says normal political 
ties depend on the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan a reduction 
of soviet troops on the chinese border and an end to soviet support 
for vietnams occupation of cambodia 
chinese premier li peng speaking to reporters today before 
departing for a trip to thailand said if everything goes 
smoothly it is likely that the summit will be held in the first 
half of next year 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev is expected to come to china 
because chinas senior leader 84yearold deng xiaoping rarely 
travels abroad troyanovsky said they had not yet discussed the 
summit site 
it will be the first chinasoviet summit since nikita khrushchev 
met mao tsetung in beijing in 1959 
china and the soviet union troyanovsky said agree on most 
international issues voting the same way more than 80 percent of 
the time at the un far more often than china and the united 
states do 
troyanovsky said economic reform being carried out in china and 
the soviet union is one of the factors which has brought about an 
improvement in the climate of our two nations 
troyanovsky said the soviet union regards china as a great power 
we think china has a great role to play both in regional matters 
and world matters he said

shipyard workers who staged a oneday 
strike in gdansk can keep their jobs for now the yards management 
announced today staterun media reported earlier that the strikers 
had been fired 
in a statement management of the repair shipyard said dismissals 
were unnecessary since strikers heeded an appeal wednesday to leave 
the shipyard 
it said management will consider the guilt of strike leaders 
later and take appropriate disciplinary decisions 
the staterun news agency pap announced wednesday night the 
director of the shipyard had fired the instigators of the strike at 
the 4500worker yard 
in view of the imprecise communique concerning the gdansk 
repair shipyard on polish radio and tv we would like to inform that 
at the appeal of the manager a small group of strikers left the 
enterprise and thus there was no need to submit disciplinary 
dismissals immediately the statement said 
the management statement read by ireneusz gradowski editor of 
the official shipyard newspaper ostrow said all workers reporting 
for work today were allowed into the yard 
hundreds of mostly young workers at the repair and wisla yards 
went on strike tuesday without the backing of solidarity leader lech 
walesa the workers were demanding that the government scrap its 
plan to begin shutting down the lenin shipyard next month 
they ended the strikes wednesday after repeated appeals from 
walesa and a threat of dismissals from management 
in september walesa persuaded strikers to end polands worst 
labor unrest in seven years in exchange for a government promise to 
hold talks on ending the countrys economic and political crisis and 
reinstating solidarity 
but the talks have been repeatedly delayed with each side 
refusing conditions set by the other one solidarity demand is that 
about 100 coal miners fired for striking in august be rehired 
the wisla and repair shipyard workers went on strike on a day 
walesa had said he might call a nationwide strike alert over the 
governments announced intention to close the 10000worker lenin 
shipyard in gdansk on dec 1 
but no strike alert was issued and walesa later said shipyard 
managers told him that liquidation of the huge complex would take 
several years 
soon after hearing wednesday of the end of the second strike 
walesa thanked the workers for heeding his request 
he argued that striking was counterproductive just now and that 
attention should be focused on starting the blocked talks with 
communist authorities 
but he also said we will fight for the shipyard sooner or 
later and we will regain it 
solidarity was born at the lenin shipyard where walesa works as 
an electrician in august 1980 during nationwide strikes it was 
crushed 15 months later in a military crackdown 
an undetermined number of workers gave up a strike wednesday 
morning at wisla shipyard which makes yachts and small river craft 
after being promised that those who took part in the strike would 
not be fired the yards strike leader jan stanecki said he said 
several hundred workers supported the strike 
at the repair shipyard 200 workers who rallied wednesday morning 
ended their strike at around 1 pm one hour after management said 
they must leave or be fired said krzysztof kamolak one of the 
strike committee members 
walesa continues to face resistance from young workers who are 
impatient for the proposed talks with the government to begin 
the talks have also stalled over walesas refusal to purge from 
solidaritys proposed delegation two people the government has 
deemed extremist longtime advisers adam michnik and jacek kuron

john newton mitchell the gruff former attorney 
general who went to prison for conspiring to cover up the watergate 
scandal in his friend richard nixons white house is dead at 75 
after collapsing on a washington street 
mitchell was the highest ranking of the government officials who 
served time for the political scandal that brought about nixons 
resignation from the presidency in august 1974 
i considered john mitchell to be one of my few close personal 
friends nixon wrote in his memoirs i believed that i owed my 
election as president in 1968 largely to his strength as a counselor 
and his skill as a manager 
an ambulance crew alerted by a 10yearold boy who was 
skateboarding found mitchell unconscious on a street in the 
georgetown section of washington in early evening wednesday 
mitchell had suffered a heart attack 
he stopped breathing as he was being taken to the hospital and 
died despite cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
mitchell was convicted on jan 1 1975 of conspiring with 
nixons chief lieutenants chief of staff hr haldeman and domestic 
counselor john d ehrlichman to cover up white house involvement in 
the watergate affair of the coverup itself and of perjury he 
fought the conviction in vain to the supreme court 
all three were sentenced after a threemonth trial to terms of 
2to8 years 
there was testimony at the senate watergate hearings at the 
coverup trial and in various published firstperson accounts that 
mitchell twice rejected plans for spying on democrats because they 
were too expensive but that he accepted a third less expensive 
version mitchell always denied the allegation 
but in a march 22 1973 taped oval office conversation 
ehrlichman said john says hes sorry he sent those burglars in 
there to which nixon replied thats right 
mitchell chimed in at that point and said you are very welcome 
sir and the transcript shows laughter 
the tapes also showed that nixon once wanted mitchell to take the 
rap for the entire watergate coverup but mitchell never said a 
harsh word about his former new york law partner and would not 
permit his defense lawyer to do so by all accounts they remained 
friends 
he was very loyal to the president and the president was not 
very loyal to him the late sen sam ervin who presided over the 
watergate hearings in the senate once said 
mitchell was the first former attorney general to be convicted of 
a crime he was disbarred and served a 19month prison term which 
included five months of medical furloughs 
when he was done with prison number 24171157 at the 
minimumsecurity facility at maxwell air force base in alabama he 
told reporters henceforth dont call me ill call you 
after his release mitchell went into the international 
consulting business with jack brennan who was nixons chief aide in 
the early postpresidential years at san clemente calif 
i never heard him be really cross about any of the things that 
happened to him or any of the people who had hurt him intentionally 
or not brennan said wednesday he has been even at my age my 
inspiration and has taught me how to forgive how to be caring and 
how not to hold grudges 
as attorney general mitchell was known for his credo that when 
the going gets tough the tough get going and in senate testimony 
he referred to watergate as white house horrors 
the former attorney generals second wife the flamboyant and 
peppery martha mitchell gained a measure of fame for her latenight 
telephone calls to reporters in which she offered shrill 
shootfromthehip opinions on controversial issues of all sorts 
including her husbands problems 
she called reporters in 1973 to announce that she and mitchell 
had split up 
after he was sentenced for conspiracy mitchell said it could 
have been a hell of a lot worse they could have sentenced me to 
spend the rest of my life with martha mitchell 
mrs mitchell died alone in a new york city hospital on may 31 
1976 after suffering from cancer of the bone marrow 
the two had one daughter marti who lives in washington 
mitchell had a son and daughter from his first marriage and there 
are five grandchildren the son jack mitchell jr died several 
years ago 
in recent years the former attorney general had a relationship 
with washington socialite mary gore dean but brennan said the two 
were not married 
brennan said mitchell paid his way through fordham law school by 
playing hockey for the new york rangers he was highly decorated in 
world war ii receiving two purple hearts and commanded the navy pt 
boat unit in which john f kennedy served 
president reagan and his wife nancy issued a statement saying 
they were saddened by the death 
jeb stuart magruder a nixon reelection committee official who 
served eight months in prison for watergate crimes recalled 
mitchell as a great mentor and friend of mine and i just loved 
that man 
magruder interviewed today on cbs this morning called 
mitchell the most levelheaded and positive person in the 
administration at that level he said he never knew mitchell to 
utter a word against nixon after the watergate scandal brought down 
his administration 
james f neal the chief counsel in the watergate coverup trial 
called mitchell an easy man to know and associate with 
he committed offenses and i prosecuted him neal said but 
he added there never was any bitterness 
mitchell was a municipal bond specialist and senior partner in 
nixons old manhattan law firm when he became chairman of nixons 
1968 election campaign he resigned as attorney general to run 
nixons reelection campaign in 1972 but quit that post as the 
watergate scandal began unfolding 
mitchells release from prison was considered the final page in 
the long watergate saga 
watergate is now a closed issue said attorney general 
griffin bell at the time

premier li peng of china said today that 
all foreign military aid to the warring factions in cambodia should 
end after vietnam withdraws its troops from that southeast asian 
nation 
following the complete withdrawal military assistance from 
foreign countries to all parties in cambodia ought to cease li 
said 
china is the key military supplier of a resistance coalition 
fighting the vietnamese and the hanoibacked government in cambodia 
vietnam must face hard facts and make a solid decision on how 
to reconcile with the involved cambodian parties on trying to end 
that conflict li said in a statement shortly after his arrival 
li called the decadelong occupation in cambodia a tinderbox 
and said there is widespread agreement to eliminate this 
tinderbox swiftly 
in beijing li told reporters before leaving that china and 
thailand share similar points of view on a political settlement of 
the kampuchean cambodian question so we would like to exchange 
points of views 
li arrived in thailand today on his first trip outside the 
country since taking office in april he was to discuss the 
cambodian issue with prime minister chatichai choonhavan and other 
thai leaders during a fiveday visit that began with a private 
audience with king bhumibol adulyadej the countrys powerful 
constitutional monarch 
in his statement chatichai urged china to expand trade and 
investment with asian and pacific nations to help sustain the 
regions rapid economic growth 
chatichai also pressed vietnam to make a solid decision on 
ending the 10year war in cambodia which vietnam invaded in late 
1978 
as key supporters of the antivietnamese forces in cambodia 
china and thailand are expected to coordinate views on how to end 
the war 
asked in beijing about chinas military aid to the khmer rouge 
the strongest of the three resistance armies li said china supports 
all three factions and our only purpose for this kind of 
assistance to the kampuchean resistance forces is to fight against 
the vietnamese invaders 
he said chinas decision to stop arming the khmer rouge is 
totally dependent on when vietnam withdraws its troops from 
kampuchea 
the khmer rouge have recently been accused of using chinese 
weapons in attacks on forces of prince norodom sihanouk and son 
sann leaders of the other two antivietnamese factions

republican connie mack held a slim lead over 
democrat kenneth buddy mackay in the us senate race this 
morning with key absentee ballots to be counted 
i feel quite confident were going to be declaring victory the 
question is when mack said wednesday in tampa before heading home 
to await the final count 
as 39 million votes filtered in election night exit polls were 
enough for the three major television networks to declare mackay the 
winner

theres still a ray of hope out there mackay campaign 
manager greg farmer said wednesday night conceding that trends 
favored mack 
i personally find it tragic that this happened to one of 
floridas best and brightest farmer said but the people have 
chosen 
at first the people appeared to be choosing mackay hey buddy 
youre a senator read the wednesday headline in some editions of 
the ocala starbanner 
but mack spokesman brian riley said the cape coral congressman 
never gave up hope 
hes very upbeat riley said wednesday evening even when 
abc projected mackay the winner he kept the faith even more than 
people on the staff he kept saying there were a lot of votes out 
there 
mackay said he would remain patient and relax at home with his 
family praying and reading poetry until all of the votes are in 
well just have to wait it out said mackay adding that 
rudyard kiplings if would be among his readings ive got a 
lot of time invested in this already 
macks late campaign strategy was based on george bushs large 
lead in polls and president reagans popularity in florida mackay 
counted on his experience and glowing reputation to overcome 
problems faced by his partys national ticket 
macks commercials with the theme hey buddy youre liberal 
tried to paint the moderate mackay with the same brush that brought 
the gop success nationally mackay said he was in the lloyd 
bentsen southern wing of the party and campaigned with retiring 
threeterm incumbent sen lawton chiles 
mack no doubt benefited from george bushs 61 percent share of 
the presidential vote we were handicapped by something we had 
nothing to do with said state democratic party chairman charles 
whitehead 
mack a former cape coral bank president and grandson of the 
baseball hall of fame manager and mackay an ocala lawyer whos 
been one of floridas mostpraised politicians for two decades both 
were elected to congress in 1982

predicted a close and strong relationship with the george bush 
administration

to give nearly 1 billion in aid for use of clark air base subic 
navy base and other installations during the agreements remaining 
two years 
asked if she would like to see a new treaty mrs aquino repeated 
the position she has taken since becoming president in a february

not answering at the moment she said i would like to keep my 
options open as far as that is concerned 
she said her government is awaiting an appeals court decision in 
switzerland in its effort to gather evidence for seven cases against 
marcos the government has accused marcos and his family and 
associates of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars and removing 
it from the country before his ouster marcos also faces charges in 
the united states

of all the men who worked for president richard 
nixon none was closer than john mitchell and none perhaps was as 
deeply involved in the watergate scandal 
mitchell was finishing out his days as attorney general in early 
1972 when a former assistant john dean brought former fbi man g 
gordon liddy to see him 
liddy then working for the reelection committee had a plan for 
conducting political espionage on the democrats as he outlined it 
it involved the use of burglaries and prostitutes and would cost 1 
million 
mitchell later testified he rejected the plan out of hand 
dean brought liddy back a second time with a scaled down plan 
that mitchell also rejected even though the cost was only a half 
million 
a third plan was submitted in writing and while mitchell 
steadfastly denied approving it by all other accounts he gave his 
ok 
he was indicted and tried along with two other top nixon aides 
chief of staff hr haldeman and domestic counselor john d 
erhlichman on charges they had tried to conceal the identifies of 
the people involved in the burglary of democratic party headquarters 
that resulted from the liddy plan 
mitchell was convicted of conspiring to obstruct justice 
obstruction of justice lying to a grand jury and perjury a charge 
of lying to the fbi was dismissed by us district judge john j 
sirica 
he served 19 months in a federal prison but five months of it 
was spent outside while he underwent hip and artery surgery 
jeb stuart magruder a nixon reelection committee official who 
served eight months in prison for watergate crimes said today he 
believed that white house paranoia drew mitchell and others into the 
watergate scandal 
i dont think john was interested at all in becoming involved 
in what became known as watergate but the pressure from the white 
house was very tough to deal with he said in an interview on 
cbs this morning 
we all came to the white house wanting to serve richard nixon 
and we tried to serve him well and im afraid when it got to that 
point there was a willingness to cover up obstruction of justice 
which of course was wrong in retrospect magruder said

are in vienna for the 50th anniversary of kristallnacht when nazi 
thugs destroyed jewish homes and businesses and beat jews 
waldheim has been accused by jewish groups of taking part in 
atrocities when he served in the balkans for the german army during 
world war ii the president denies the allegations 
waldheims election is a legitimation of the crimes of the 
holocaust weiss said standing under the hofburg palace balcony

of austria to nazi germany 
with a prayer shawl over his shoulders weiss and the others 
began to walk to waldheims offices nearby to deliver a letter

could not continue what he termed their demonstration in 
austria a demonstration must be registered with police 24 hours in 
advance 
nine uniformed police surrounded the trio and refused to let them

the utah bureau of air quality has approved 
an air force plan to detonate explosives equal to 250 tons of tnt to 
test a new type of munitions storage shed 
the blast equivalent to about oneeightieth of the explosive 
force of the atomic bomb dropped on hiroshima in 1945 tentatively 
is scheduled for monday at the air forces utah test and training 
range 70 miles from salt lake city 
the test is intended to determine how far apart the storage sheds 
must be to prevent an explosion in one from detonating explosives in 
others 
burnell cordner director of the air quality bureau said the 
blast would create no significant air pollution problems and he 
issued the necessary permit 
among the conditions set by the bureau were a requirement that 
the wind not be blowing toward populated areas and that there be no 
temperature inversion which could trap the blast force near the 
ground 
the air force said that in an absolutely worstcase scenario 
the blast could break windows on the wasatch front where provo 
salt lake city and ogden are situated but that can be avoided by 
detonating in proper weather 
steve erickson of downwinders a watchdog group said the air 
force has not properly investigated the geology in the area he said 
the soil might be softer than expected and capable of producing 
large destructive shock waves 
if their calculations are correct and everything is done 
properly under right conditions and if there is no subsurface 
problem then probably this will go off without any significant 
environmental human health or economic damage he said 
however if it occurs at the wrong time or if there are 
subsurface problems it could cause real problems

britain and iran said today they have resumed full 
diplomatic relations ending a 17month break in ties caused in part 
by the arrest of an iranian envoy on shoplifting charges 
todays announcement followed talks in vienna between sir david 
myers britains assistant under secretary of state for middle 
eastern affairs and dr mahmoud vaezi director general of irans 
ministry of foreign affairs 
iran and britain have decided to resume full diplomatic 
representation with immediate effect based on reciprocity mutual 
respect and noninterference in each others affairs said a 
foreign office statement 
tehran radio said a statement and memorandum of understanding 
were signed at irans mission in vienna after a ninehour session 
that ended early this morning myers traveled to the austrian 
capital wednesday for the third round of negotiations since august 
mohammad basti irans lone diplomat in britain throughout the 
diplomatic freeze hinted that the resumption of ties could speed 
the release of britons held hostage by proiranian islamic militants 
in lebanon 
questioned on british broadcasting corp radio basti said the 
hostage issue had not arisen in the negotiations but added if 
you are trying to imply that the new relationship between iran and 
britain may contribute to that end im not going to deny that 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie whose envoy terry waite 
disappeared in lebanon in january 1987 while trying to help free the 
hostages was also asked whether renewed ties would help the 
hostages 
certainly this cannot do any harm he said we must wait 
and see this is welcome news after all the purpose of this 
diplomacy is to make it easy for governments to talk to each other 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe said the hostages plight was 
not included in the discussions 
theres no bargain or secret agenda he told the bbc but he 
added that the thaw enabled britain more effectively to press the 
case at every opportunity for the iranians to use all the influence 
they have got to secure the release of hostages 
diplomatic relations were curtailed in june 1987 after an iranian 
diplomat was arrested on shoplifting charges in britain and 
militants kidnapped and beat up a british diplomat in tehran 
britain withdrew its diplomats from tehran closed the iranian 
consulate in manchester northern england and reduced the number of 
iranian staff at the london embassy to one 
since then british interests in iran have been looked after by 
sweden 
a diplomatic source in london speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the agreement allowed for up to 16 diplomats in each 
country to assume posts over the next several months 
howe said britain would have a charge daffaires in iran within a 
few weeks and an exchange of ambassadors within hopefully six 
months of that 
besides waite britain is seeking the release of journalist john 
mccarthy and teacher brian keenan the foreign office says it also 
seeks word on alec collett a new yorkbased british journalist 
whose palestinian abductors claim they killed him his body was 
never found

irans chief negotiator says he expects the 
exchange of sick and wounded prisoners with iraq to improve the 
climate of peace talks between the persian gulf enemies 
but foreign minister ali akbar velayati also said there is no 
chance the two nations will reach a comprehensive peace settlement 
unless iraq recognizes the border between the nations as it was set 
under a 1975 treaty 
in an interview with the associated press velayati also said 
wednesday night he sees no prospects so far for improving ties with 
the united states 
he said iran will continue efforts to obtain the release of 
hostages in lebanon although our possibilities are limited 
iran and iraq agreed to a proposal by the international committee 
of the red cross to exchange 1569 sick and wounded pows velayati 
sai this may create a better atmosphere at the talks and may 
make them more active 
he again said iran considers this exchange to be independent of 
the talks which are aimed making permanent the ceasefire that took 
effect aug 20 
repatriation of another 100000 prisoners must be linked to other 
points in the un ceasefire resolution that both sides have 
endorsed he said 
he said the highest priority in the resolution is the provision 
calling for both sides to withdraw troops to internationally 
recognized boundaries 
the dispute over the border has stalled the talks since they 
began aug 25 because iraq repudiated a 1975 treaty with iran that 
defined the border 
international law confirms our position that the treaty remains 
valid velayati said when you say that the first step should be 
the withdrawal to internationally recognized borders where is that 
border if you do not have a valid treaty 
commenting on the issue of hostages held by proiranian groups in 
lebanon velayati said irans efforts have helped free many 
people including americans germans regardless of their 
nationality 
we continue our humanitarian efforts to get these hostages 
released but we really dont know the destiny of these people in 
lebanon and which group has which hostages we have some spiritual 
relations with the moslems in lebanon but our possibilities are 
limited 
nine americans are held in lebanon including terry anderson 
chief mideast correspondent for the associated press who was 
abducted march 16 1985

opposition lawmakers walked out of a 
crystal night ceremony today after claiming a speech by the 
parliament president failed to express proper grief for nazi crimes 
against jews 
the 26page speech by president philipp jenninger made some 
listeners cry but drew angry criticism from other members of 
parliament who said jenniger recounted nazi atrocities in an 
inappropriately cool and dispassionate manner 
he marched through history with the intellect of combat 
boots said wolfgang lueder a parliament member of the free 
democratic party 
the controversy marred a session marking the 50th anniversary of 
kristallnacht the first night of organized nazi terror against the 
jews 
 
the ceremony featured an emotional appearance by ida ehre an 
88yearold nazi concentration camp survivor who read from paul 
celans poem todesfuge 
 
death is a master from germany his eye is blue ms ehre a 
wellknown actress and director in hamburg read from the famous 
work he strikes thee with leaden bullets he strikes thee 
exactly 
ms ehre dressed in black with a white blouse spoke before 
parliament and invited guests including west german jewish leader 
heinz galinski 
during the third reich the nazis barred the jewish actress from 
working and eventually sent her to a concentration camp for several 
years 
later during todays session ms ehre put her hands on her 
forehead and began crying as jenninger began reading an eyewitness 
account of the murder of concentration camp victims in 1942 
blood was running over the shoulders of almost everyone the 
56yearold jenninger read some of those shot were still moving 
some lifted their arms and turned their heads to show they were 
still alive 
as he read some of the lawmakers in the audience appeared on the 
verge of tears and federal president richard von weizsaecker at one 
point buried his head in his hand 
but some opposition lawmakers said other portions of jennigers 
lacked a feeling of atonement for what happened to the jews during 
the holocaust and demanded he resign as a parliament president 
social democratic and greens party members left the hall to 
protest the speech which was part of the hourlong service 
televised live nationwide 
i dont agree with this speech but i will express my criticism 
within the party said johannes gerster a member of jenningers 
own christian democratic party 
lueder said jenninger spoke of germans and foreign jews instead 
of jewish germans lueder criticized jenninger for using 
expressions such as arianization of property without sufficient 
explanation of its ruthless meaning during the third reich he also 
criticized jenninger for not using the expression german jews 
when talking about the victims of the nazi terror 
social democrat and greens members criticized jenninger for 
presenting the speech in a dry emotionless way and for not 
clearly expressing repulsion at what the nazis did 
west germany austria and communist east germany have held 
observances this week as a reminder of the death and destruction 
begun during kristallnacht and carried on throughout the holocaust 
on the night of nov 910 1938 nazi thugs ransacked 7500 
jewish businesses destroyed thousands of jewish homes and sent 
30000 jews to concentration camps ninetyone jews were killed and 
267 synagogues destroyed 
the rampage coordinated by adolf hitlers henchmen left city 
streets littered with glass hence the name kristallnacht or night 
of broken glass 
historians say kristallnacht was the start of the nazis campaign 
to wipe out european jews a campaign that eventually claimed 6 
million jewish lives 
there are about 32000 jews in west germany the number of 
practicing jews in east germany is estimated at 450600 with no 
permanent rabbi

the government used a surprise vote to ram 
controversial taxreform bills through a parliamentary committee 
today and police had to be summoned to control screaming opposition 
members 
the governing liberal democratic party which holds a commanding 
majority in the tax reform committe and in parliament approved the 
bills which would result in the first sweeping overhaul of the 
countrys tax system in 40 years 
opposition legislators who had boycotted the committee session 
rushed into the chamber after the chairman suddenly called for a 
vote they screamed tyrant and disgrace but about 50 
policemen surrounded the chairmans desk and blocked them from 
interfering with the vote 
we are sorry that we finally could not reach agreement with 
opposition parties shintaro abe the governing party secretary 
general said later but we had to pass the bills because we are 
running out of time 
the liberal democrats could have forced the bills through from 
the start but such a tactic is rare and against the japanese 
parliamentary tradition of seeking consensus and compromise even if 
only in making small changes to let the opposition save face the 
public is thought to regard forceful tactics as signs of arrogance 
or undemocratic tendencies which can cost a party votes 
opposition leaders reacted fiercely to the unexpected vote 
it was an act of tyranny said tsuruo yamaguchi secretary 
general of the main opposition japan socialist party passage of 
such important legislation without the approval of the people and 
opposition party not only neglects the peoples interest but also 
indicates the ldps intention to conceal scandal 
the opposition boycotted the committee session to try to force 
the government to disclose more information about the socalled 
recruit scandal which involves scores of top politicians including 
prime minister noboru takeshita and finance minister kiichi miyazawa 
the scandal began in july with revelations that the politicians 
or their aides profited from selling unlisted shares they acquired 
in the recruitcosmos co a real estate subsidiary of the recruit 
co a big conglomerate 
by boycotting parliamentary sessions the opposition sought to 
link progress on the taxreform bills with further revelations that 
would damage the liberal democrats

the sole supplier of rayon yarn used in 
the space shuttle and military rockets reopened today as abruptly as 
it closed a week ago 
workers began reporting to the aging avtex fibers inc textile 
mill this morning 
the reopening of the 1300employee plant took nasa and other 
officials by surprise the space agency had held discussions with 
the company in an effort to ensure continued manufacture of the 
rayon used in rocket nozzles 
i was not aware of that said ed medal a spokesman for 
nasas marshall space flight center in huntsville ala to my 
knowledge there has not been a formalized agreement realized 
in a statement wednesday john n gregg avtex chairman and chief 
executive officer said the company was able to negotiate a 
longterm contract with certain aerospace industry companies that 
will allow avtex fibersfront royal to return to full production of 
its fiber products 
gregg said avtex won the contract with the encouragement of 
nasa and the defense department he did not elaborate the statement 
did not specify what sort of arrangement was made or with whom 
however an aide for rep d french slaughter jr rva said 
the financial agent for the deal is space shuttle engine maker 
morton thiokol inc h george white iii said morton thiokol is 
wiring avtex 1 million today for the mills reopening and will 
provide between 4 million and 5 million in the next week the 
total investment by the rocket maker will be around 19 million 
white said 
thiokol spokesman rocky raab said the company was continuing its 
negotiations with avtex based in valley forge pa 
it could be an interim sort of agreement he said from the 
companys headquarters in ogden utah 
gregg announced oct 31 he was closing the 49yearold mill 
citing economic fallout from the 1986 challenger disaster foreign 
competition and stiff environmental regulations the announcement 
sent nasa the department of defense and several government 
contractors scrambling to figure out what the impact would be on the 
space shuttle program and other projects that depend on a 
carbonizable rayon fiber 
nasa has said it has enough of the material on hand for another 
10 shuttle flights the fiber is used in engine nozzles of the 
shuttle and a variety of defense missiles

a jury today acquitted a man of sexually 
molesting his 5yearold daughter in a case that drew national 
attention when the girls mother went to jail rather than let her 
husband see the child 
after about three hours of deliberation a superior court jury 
found 33yearold mark russell murabito of derry not guilty 
supporters in the back of the courtroom cheered 
his former wife jesse murabito 40 was led from the courtroom 
by supporters with her head down 
defense attorney eugene mccann disputed the testimony of a child 
psychiatrist and a pediatrician arguing the child was influenced by 
her mother and learned through repeated interrogations by her to 
describe the alleged abuse 
do you think she learned the story he asked during closing 
arguments do you think she got a feel for what it is that mommy 
is looking for 
he said the girl had been psychologically abused by her mother 
her father and the system but not sexually abused by her father 
she has been bounced off everyone you can think of as it relates 
to psychological abuse he said 
county attorney carleton eldredge argued that the girl had 
engaged in adult sexual behavior unusual and inappropriate for 
children her age and that it must have been shown to her 
the girl was her own best spokesperson when she said that daddy 
touched her he said 
eldredge also disputed defense contention that mrs murabitos 
behavior marked her as an obsessive paranoid what is the standard 
of a mother who thinks her child has been sexually abused he 
asked frantic probably doesnt describe it 
jesse murabito was motivated solely to defend her child and she 
did it every way she knew how he said within that context 
jesse murabito makes more sense than anybody weve heard from 
dr muriel sugarman a child psychiatrist and dr charles 
shubin a pediatrician who specializes in examining alleged sexually 
abused children had testified for the prosecution supporting the 
allegations of sexual abuse

a report released today blamed lax safety standards 
for a subway fire that killed 31 people last year hours before the 
government study was issued the two top men running londons subway 
system resigned 
the report said subway management did not guard against the 
unpredictability of fire and that staff response to the nov 18 
blaze was uncoordinated haphazard and untrained 
dr tony ridley chairman and chief executive of the london 
underground announced his resignation this morning sir keith 
bright chairman of london regional transport the controlling body 
quit wednesday night bright had been chairman and chief executive 
of the transport agency since 1982 
transport secretary paul channon presented the report to the 
house of commons on the governmentordered inquiry into the fire at 
kings cross station the subway systems busiest station 
during the 91day inquiry the board was criticized over safety 
standards and bright was criticized for appearing to promote the 
theory that the fire was started by an arsonist 
police and forensic scientists said they believed the fire was 
started by a lighted match or cigarette dropped by a smoker onto a 
wooden escalator which ignited greasesoaked trash underneath 
flames raced up the escalator into the ticket lobby following 
the blaze smoking was banned throughout the subway 
in the report attorney desmond fennell made 157 recommendations 
to improve the subway urging it to institute a managed safety 
program he said nobody had overall responsibility for safety at 
the time of the fire 
ridley called the subway one of the safest forms of transport 
and criticized the 250page report as an emotive document 
in june bright told the fennell inquiry that he had he offered 
to resign immediately after the fire but agreed to stay on at 
channons request 
bright said in a statement wednesday night that he has since 
devoted most of my energy to seeking to ensure that the 
lessons of kings cross have been learned and that actions 
necessary to avoid a recurrence should be vigorously pressed 
ahead 
he said he felt he had accomplished that task and with the 
impending release of the report it was time to resign 
earlier this year the board undertook more than 100 
improvements including the removal of wooden panels from 
escalators staff retraining and reinforcement of liaison procedures 
with emergency services 
lawyer ian walker who represents most of the families of the 
victims said of brights resignation the decision will come as a 
relief to many of the relatives of victims who feel very strongly 
that london regional transport was very much to blame for the 
tragedy 
legislator john prescott the labor partys transport spokesman 
said it is inevitable that bright should resign in view of the 
total failure of management to give proper safety 
before the fire only one person had died in a blaze on the 
subway in 1985 but fires are regularly reported on the crowded 
125yearold system parts of which badly need modernizing 
a safety report two years before the kings cross fire said there 
were 10 serious fires in the system between 1976 and 1985 
the association of london authorities representing london 
boroughs controlled by the labor party said subway safety had 
deteriorated since the kings cross fire it said there were 21 
serious fires on the subway in the first six months of this year 
compared to 10 in all of 1987 
a serious fire is defined as one that stops trains for more than 
30 minutes 
the subway carries 750 million passengers a year more than 
200000 a day board or leave trains at kings cross station a 
multilevel complex that is a terminus for commuter rail lines 
in the worst postwar accident on the subway 43 people died and 
74 were hurt when a train crashed at moorgate station in the 
business district in 1975

chinas most famous dissident gave a rare public 
lecture to a standingroomonly crowd of students at beijing 
university telling them he believes demonstrations are quite 
beautiful 
more than 600 students packed a small lecture hall and the 
adjoining hallway wednesday night to hear fang lizhis lecture on 
physics and beauty the astrophysicists first public speech on 
the campus since may 
fang joked freely about government claims he helped inspire 
prodemocracy student demonstrations two years ago which led to his 
expulsion from the communist party 
i think demonstrations are quite beautiful fang said 
pointing to a cartoon of bannerwaving demonstrators that he said 
illustrated his concept of beauty the unity of chaos and order 
unfortunately he said some people dont appreciate this 
kind of beauty 
thousands of students at colleges in beijing shanghai and other 
major cities took to the streets in the winter of 198687 to press 
demands for democracy the protests ended with harsh warnings from 
the government and the ouster of party chief hu yaobang for failing 
to crack down on the demonstrators 
fang was forced to resign as vice president of the university of 
science and technology in eastern china and expelled from the party 
fang noted the students were criticized for lacking a 
welldefined program to back up their prodemocracy slogans but he 
praised them for having started people thinking 
the slogans were correct he said over the past two years 
people have been in the process of developing the arguments and 
reasoning to support them 
fang reiterated his views on the need for greater freedom for 
chinese reporters publishers and researchers he cited difficulties 
with getting his own books published as evidence that china does not 
have a free press 
student organizers of the lecture said they announced the lecture 
only two hours in advance to avoid attracting attention from school 
authorities and the large turnout on such short notice indicated 
fangs popularity 
the audience frequently broke into applause throughout the 
lecture usually in response to fangs subtle political humor 
fang said campus authorities approved the studentorganized 
lecture series of which his talk was a part but had not given 
specific permission for him to speak i dont think there will be 
any problems he said i only implied a lot of things i didnt 
say anything directly

a flock of ravens flew into homes and attacked 
people in a neighborhood outside tel aviv in what one resident said 
thursday looked like a scene from alfred hitchcocks horror movie 
the birds 
police shot and killed one of the large black birds after several 
residents of yahud a town about six miles east of tel aviv 
complained that about 20 ravens had perched on nearby trees and were 
harassing residents israel radio reported 
two people suffered scratches in the attacks before police killed 
the most aggressive bird wednesday night the radio said 
the daily maariv newspaper published a picture of a policeman 
holding the dead raven which had a wing span of about three feet 
this raven was evil it had frightening black eyes large wings 
and a large beak yahud resident pazit sasson was quoted as saying 
another woman said the ravens had been a problem in the 
neighborhood for more than a month 
the birds would fly around the houses and bother us when we 
were sleeping said the woman who was not identified for two 
weeks we have been sleeping with closed shutters and closed 
windows 
it was just like the movie by hitchcock whenever we opened our 
windows the birds would arrive she told the radio 
a police spokesman said the neighborhood was quiet thursday and 
troopers had decided against asking a special air force unit to help 
them chase away the ravens 
eliezer frankenberg coordinator for wild animal protection at 
israels nature reserve authority said he did not expect the birds 
to continue harassing the neighborhood 
ravens are very smart frankenberg said if one of them is 
killed the others will quickly learn not to attack 
he said ravens usually do not bother humans unless the birds are 
defending their territory the birds are not prone to attack and 
should not be considered a threat he added 
something like this happens from time to time but it is very 
unusual frankenberg said the birds may try to peck someone on 
the head a little bit but i wouldnt call it an attack

scientists probing the sea floor off the coast 
of oregon have discovered a new field of hot springs mineral 
deposits and exotic animal life the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration announced thursday 
the area as long as five city blocks offers a new frontier for 
scientific exploration according to peter rona chief scientist for 
the team 
rona has led noaas deepsea explorations in both the pacific and 
atlantic oceans in recent years discovering a variety of volcanic 
hot springs in both oceans as well as exotic tube worms and other 
life forms 
the new finds were made along an underwater mountain range called 
the gorda ridge about 100 miles off the oregon coast the 
scientists went as deep as 10000 feet using a navy deep submergence 
vehicle 
the finding will allow scientists to study firsthand how 
seafloor hot springs form metallic mineral deposits support exotic 
forms of life and influence the ocean environment rona said 
water temperatures in the hot springs were measured as high as 
500 degrees fahrenheit 
rona said that in the area large plates in the earths crust are 
being pulled and cracked allowing sea water to contact with 
volcanic rocks 
the heated water leaches metals from the rock and deposits them 
on the sea floor 
thickets of tube worms several feet high topped with bright red 
plumes are growing around the hot springs the scientists said in 
addition they found crabs octopuses deepsea fish and other life 
forms 
these deepwater vents in the sea floor were only discovered a 
few years ago when rona and other scientists began investigating the 
waters around the united states after president reagan proclaimed an 
exclusive economic zone offshore 
the vents have been found in the gorda and juan de fuca ridges 
off the oregon coast and also far out in the atlantic 
in addition to rona participants in the gorda ridge dives 
included scientists from the us geological survey oregon state 
university the oregon department of geology and mineral resources 
and the universities of californiadavis and hawaii

810600 in fines and other penalties 
the 810600 include 250000 in criminal penalties and 250000 
in civil restitution

contracts and occurred at sperrys sierra vista office the company 
acknowledged 
a bates butler iii an attorney representing unisys told us 
district judge richard bilby the army has determined that unisys is 
a responsible contractor and will not be barred from holding 
government contracts

alerted pentagon investigators to the last 150000 of the total 
250000 in misallocations

folks selling goods at craft fairs will find 
life a little easier under a change in federal consumerprotection 
rules announced thursday 
the change in federal trade commission regulations will exempt 
arts and crafts sellers and also sellers of automobiles at public 
auctions and tent sales from having to give buyers a threeday 
coolingoff period 
ftc rules in effect since 1972 have required that people selling 
items costing 25 or more and making the sale somewhere other than 
their normal place of business give buyers three days to change 
their minds and provide a notice of cancellation for the consumer 
to use if necessary 
that regulation was intended to protect buyers who succumb to 
highpressure tactics on the part of doortodoor sales people 
the commission said it decided to give an exemption to people who 
sell arts and cfafts items at fairs because those sales do not 
appear to present a threat of deceptive practices 
the exemption for auto sales at auctions and tent sales applies 
as long as the seller has a permanent place of business where a 
consumer can go to complain should a problem arise with the purchase

economic worries kept the financial markets from 
celebrating george bushs decisive victory over michael dukakis 
even though traders had anticipated and welcomed another republican 
in the white house 
the dollar dropped sharply against most major currencies 
wednesday after rallying briefly in japan and prices for stocks and 
bonds followed suit 
it ended lower in tokyo today and continued to fall elsewhere 
the markets had already discounted a bush victory after the 
second presidential debate but a lot of uncertainty remains 
about key economic problems said david resler chief economist 
for nomura securities co international 
a key issue economists say is whether bush and the 
democraticcontrolled congress can work together to trim the budget 
and trade deficits inherited from the reagan administration 
i look at it as basic economic reality versus political 
constraints said robert a brusca chief financial economist for 
nikko securities co international bush has said there would be 
no tax increase so that will mean budget cuts the impasse will 
be over where to cut 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials lead a 
broad market decline wednesday dropping 925 to 211824 despite 
recovering some lost ground in the final 90 minutes of trading the 
closely watched index advanced 285 points on election day 
by midday today stock prices turned mixed the dow jones average 
was down 089 points at 211735 at noon est 
interest rates moved up as bond prices declined wednesday the 
yield on the treasurys bellwether 30year issue hovered around 9 
percent for the first time in more than a month while its price 
fell about 5 per 1000 face amount shortterm rates also rose 
slightly 
edward yardeni chief economist for prudential bache securities 
inc said that a weak dollar in foreign exchange also helped drag 
down stock and bond prices other factors affecting the markets he 
said included this weeks 30 billion quarterly treasury auction 
and concerns over whether the federal reserve might be quietly 
tightening credit 
its hard to disentangle all those things said maury harris 
chief economist for painewebber inc 
the dollar initially rallied overseas after bushs victory but 
reversed course later in japan and europe largely on profittaking 
and investor nervousness it continued weakening in domestic trading 
despite reports of central bank intervention 
the dollar dropped to threemonth lows against the west german 
mark the british pound and the dutch guilder in europe and to a 
fivemonth low against the japanese yen 
the dollar selloff intensified following comments from martin 
feldstein former head of reagans council of economic advisers and 
an adviser to bush he said the us currency should drop at least 
20 percent in the value during the next three years to help reduce 
the trade gap a cheaper dollar makes us exports more attractive 
in foreign markets 
apprehension about the economy under a new administration also 
was shared in some overseas stock markets 
in tokyo the 225issue nikkei stock average lost 4636 points 
today to close at 2816642 
in london on wednesday the financial timesstock exchange 
100share index fell 149 points to close at 18257 
stock and bond prices had edged higher and the dollar rose 
against major foreign currencies in the united states on tuesday

surrounded hundreds of turkeys thursday after a tractortrailer 
truck overturned spilling the birds onto interstate 35 
we were prepared to shoot them because fowl are very difficult 
to contain patrol capt loren dykeman said 
traffic on the busy interstate was rerouted around the 
interchange for four hours as six officers tried to prevent the 
birds from fleeing into an adjoining lane of the highway

cause another accident but dykeman said they huddled together to 
keep warm in temperatures in the mid30s 
the turkeys moment of thanksgiving was shortlived however the

a huge white banner stretches over main 
street downtown owenton bearing the uneasy message owen county 
needs a doctor inquire at courthouse 
we need two or three doctors said james b ellis 65 a 
retired state worker but we need at least one awful bad 
rural areas across the country are desperate for doctors and are 
turning to desperate measures to recruit them 
my thinking in putting it banner up was to let the community 
know that we are going to have a big problem in a few months said 
david smith a general practitioner who is planning to move from 
owenton in march 
the banner paid off with at least one inquiry a doctor driving 
through town last week saw it and has begun talking with county 
officials said county judgeexecutive horace doug west 
but theres nothing definite yet he added 
owen county is raising money and hopes to guarantee a firstyear 
salary of 75000 for a family doctor in the past the county has 
guaranteed wages given free office space and paid the salaries of 
support personnel to woo doctors 
but the county of 9000 people has had trouble keeping young 
doctors in the area 
a doctor fresh out of school wants to move closer to home 
west said were looking for a doctor who wants to make this his 
home 
smith 31 who moved here several years ago as part of a federal 
program now being phased out wants to go home to his family in 
illinois he has said he will leave in march giving officials some 
time to find a replacement 
as of now owenton ranks 36th in kentucky in terms of need for a 
physician said danise newton program administrator for the 
physician placement service in the department of health services 
robertson county is at the top of the list because it doesnt 
have any doctors ms newton said 
kentucky is no different than many other states ms newton 
said it has a problem finding physicians for rural areas there 
is no magical way of doing it 
ms newton said there were several reasons doctors are not 
choosing to practice in rural areas 
hospitals are small or nonexistent and doctors experience 
professional isolation often there is not another physician who 
will cover for them so there is no time off most physicians do 
their residency in an urban area and dont want to move to a small 
town spouses also have a problem finding jobs 
there are much more lucrative practices in northern kentucky 
lexington or louisville said brad hughes spokesman for the 
cabinet for human resources unless doctors are homegrown theyre 
not going to a small community 
the crisis in owenton is still a few checkups away two other 
doctors are practicing in the area but one wants to retire and the 
other pamela pieterse is unsure whether shell stay after her 
contract expires next summer

the air force has returned to service 25 of its 
98 b1b bombers after inspecting them for electrical hydraulic and 
fule line problems the pentagon said today 
the inspections were prompted by tuesdays crash during a routine 
training flight out of dyess air force base in west texas the four 
men aboard ejected safely after steering the flaming aircraft away 
from homes where it crashed west of abilene 
pentagon officials said wednesday that the remaining b1bs 
longrange bombers designed to be capable of carrying out nuclear 
strikes against the soviet union would be grounded until the 
inspections were completed 
dan howard the pentagons chief spokesman said 25 of the planes 
had been inspected and returned to flight status as of 9 am est 
today 
col albert jensen wing commander at dyess said television 
footage of tuesdays crash led air force officials to believe the 
plane was downed by a fire in or around its two leftwing engines 
some training flights had resumed at dyess by wednesday 
afternoon officials said the planes flying had passed the 
inspection ordered by the strategic air command 
the inspections take two to three hours per plane according to 
the air force 
an air force official at the pentagon who asked not to be named 
said the inspections generally focus on electrical hydraulic and 
fuel lines the official declined to be more specific as did lt 
col george h peck a spokesman at sac headquarters in omaha neb 
sac which is responsible for landbased nuclear bomber and 
missile forces said the grounding and inspection order was issued 
wednesday as a normal precaution in the wake of a major accident 
peck said the order would not affect the b1bs current standing 
alert to be ready for immediate takeoff in the event of nuclear war 
in texas the air force set up a roadblock to seal off the crash 
site wednesday and sent in military investigators who spent the day 
mapping the area and searching through debris 
the wreckage was scattered over an area seven miles by two miles 
said al dostal an air force spokesman 
jensen said his speculation of a fire around the left wing 
engines was based on a video tape aired on a television newscast 
the air force has been criticized over the past two years for its 
handling of the b1b program primarily because of acknowledged 
problems in developing the bombers radarjamming gear however the 
service insists the plane is still the best longrange bomber in the 
world 
the air force has purchased 100 b1bs at a total cost of 273 
billion or about 273 million per plane the last plane was 
delivered on april 30 
tuesdays crash was the second involving a productionmodel b1b 
in 14 months leaving the air force with 98 of its original 100 
planes 
the bombers have been deployed at four bases dyess ellsworth 
afb sd grand forks afb nd and mcconnell afb kan 
the fourengine swingwing b1b was the first addition to 
americas manned bomber force in more than 25 years the plane is 
designed to fill the gap between the aging fleet of b52 bombers and 
the new b2 stealth bomber the first of which is to be publicly 
unveiled later this month 
the air force lost the first of the b1bs on sept 28 1987 when 
a plane based at dyess ran into a flock of migrating birds during a 
lowlevel bomb run at a colorado flight range three crew members 
were killed 
earlier before productionmodel planes entered the inventory 
the air force lost a b1a prototype in august 1984 during a test 
flight at edwards air force base calif one crewman died and two 
were injured 
the bomber built by rockwell international corp has a maximum 
speed of about 1000 mph and a range of more than 7000 miles

baring a poorly kept secret the pentagon today 
made public details of a stealth jet fighter that has been ready 
for five years to slip behind enemy lines in the event of war 
dan howard the defense departments chief spokesman said the 
stealth fighter first flew in june 1981 and was declared operational 
in october 1983 
the air force has ordered 59 of the planes 52 of them have 
already been delivered he said adding the plane is a singleseat 
twinengine aircraft 
the plane which in some repsects resembles a small space shuttle 
with swept wings and a vtail was unveiled primarily because the 
air force needs to start flying the plane during daylight hours if 
it is to integrate the fighter squadrons war plans with other 
units howard said 
the plane has been restricted in the interests of secrecy and 
national security to nighttime flying ever since it was declared 
operational howard said 
the stealth fighter is officially known as the f117a the 
spokesman continued 
it has been operational since october 1983 and is assigned to 
the 4450th tactical group at nellis air force base nev the 
aircraft is based at the tonopah test range airfield in nevada 
howard and air force officials while releasing a photo of the 
plane in flight flatly declined to discuss how much the program 
cost the planes dimensions or general capabilities such as speed 
its assigned combat role the materials from which it was 
constructed and the major subcontractors 
the plane is built by the lockheed corp at a tightly guarded 
plant in burbank calif the air force said production line 
workers at the lockheed plant have gone to court with charges they 
are being sickened by exposure to dangerous chemicals 
the service also acknowledged that three of the planes have 
crashed the first production model of the plane crashed with a 
lockheed corp pilot at the controls the air force said 
that test pilot survived the accident for which no date was 
given 
the second crash occurred on july 11 1986 near bakersfield 
calif and the third on oct 14 1987 at nellis air force base 
the service said both pilots died in those accidents 
the decision to unveil the plane was prompted in part by air 
force plans to display publicly its new b2 stealth bomber on nov 
22 said defense officials who asked not to be named 
the bomber has been built with more recent and advanced 
technology than the fighter so there was little reason to continue 
to hide the fighter the sources said 
pentagon officials also had concluded that even if they wanted to 
keep the program secret upcoming court fights were likely to 
shatter security the sources continued 
according to military sources the planes are kept at a high 
state of readiness for use as aerial shock troops capable of 
slipping behind enemy lines without being detected and creating 
confusion with unexpected bombing runs 
the picture released by howard shows a black or dark blue 
metallic aircraft without exterior markings unlike the new stealth 
bomber which is being constructed in the shape of a flying wing 
without any sharp edges the fighter resembles a sleek shuttle with 
a small cockpit contained in a nose that comes to a sharp point 
the two engines are grouped together below the vshaped tail and 
are not visible from the top or sides the wings are swept to the 
rear and appear to be fixed from some angles the plane almost 
looks like a flying sting ray 
the picture suggests the plane has been fabricated with some 
unusual materials but the air force declined to discuss the matter

nasa has agreed to help pick a landing site on 
mars for a robot craft that the soviets will launch in 1994 
american and soviet scientists announced thursday at a joint news 
conference 
samuel w keller the head of the nasa delegation that has been 
negotiating with soviet scientists said that the soviets have 
picked four candidate landing sites after the united states provided 
detailed maps of the martian surface 
keller said the soviets have now asked for more data and details 
on the candidate sites 
he made the comment at a news conference marking the end of a 
week of negotiations between representatives of the national 
aeronautics and space administration and a delegation representing 
the soviet solar system exploration program the two groups met to 
work out areas of cooperation 
academician valeriy l barsukov head of the soviet delegation 
said that the four candidate mars landing sites are all located 
within 30 degrees of the equator but he declined to be more 
specific 
nasa accumulated a vast amount of detailed images and maps of 
mars during viking spacecraft missions between 1975 and 1980 the 
viking program put two craft in orbit of mars and two on the surface 
the soviets plan to launch a spacecraft in 1994 that will orbit 
mars and drop a lander that will scoop up soil and return it to 
earth 
barsukov said that in picking a landing site the soviets are 
considering such issues as a search for water and life getting 
comprehensive samples of the geology and gaining insights into the 
martian evolution 
keller said other agreements reached during negotiations this 
week included 
using the american deep space network to help track and 
communicate with soviet mars probes 
an exchange of scientific personnel for work on specific 
missions 
an exchange of data on venus a planet extensively explored by 
both countries keller said the ussoviet studies are being 
combined to produce four detailed maps 
an exchange of lunar material gathered by the apollo program for 
meteorite material collected by the soviets 
an exchange of scientific instruments for use on planetary 
probes 
barsukov said that the soviets feel that a manned mars landing is 
inevitable and that it probably will take place in the middle of 
the next century 
but before a manned mission to mars is attempted barsukov said 
there probably will be new manned flights to the moon he declined 
to elaborate

fbi director william sessions said today the 
bureau is looking at a wide range of possible federal violations in 
connection with the criminal probe of the computer virus incident 
which revolves around a 23yearold cornell university graduate 
student 
at a news conference sessions said investigators are trying to 
determine whether statutes concerning wire fraud malicious mischief 
or unlawful access to stored communications may have been broken 
earlier the bureau had said it was focusing on a federal law 
that prohibits fraud or related activity in connection with 
computers the computer fraud and abuse act of 1986 
sessions also said the preliminary phase of the criminal 
investigation probably will be completed in the next two weeks 
cornell student robert t morris has told friends that he created 
the computer virus that disabled thousands of computers last week 
but didnt intend for it to invade computer systems around the 
country 
we often look at intent as being knowing and intentional doing 
of an act which the law forbids and knowing that the law forbids it 
to be done sessions said but we also have other statutes which 
deal simply with knowingly doing something 
the malicious mischief statute which sessions referred to 
provides a maximum 10year prison term for anyone who wilfully 
interferes with the use of any communications line controlled by the 
us government 
the unlawful access law which the fbi director referred to makes 
it a crime to prevent authorized access to electronic communications 
while they are in electronic storage and carries a maximum sixmonth 
jail term absent malicious destruction or damage

nearly 20 years have passed since their 
sons flagdraped coffins came home aboard a us cargo plane from 
vietnam but for polly dixon and evelyn barbour the grieving goes 
on 
the deaths of their sons brought the two women together in 1969 
and together they have found the strength to help the men who 
survived the troubling war their boys didnt 
one day a week they become the moms of the citys vietnam 
veterans outreach center answering telephones making coffee and 
sitting in the lobby to talk to anyone who comes in while the 
counseling group is in session 
its really been a lifeline for me mrs dixon said i have 
a lot of compassion for these guys and they relate to us because 
they understand our pain a lot of them have parents who are dead 
the women first visited the center three years ago and decided to 
volunteer the center which opened in 1982 is one of 189 
nationwide and has served 2200 vietnam veterans in its six years 
i still feel out of everything bad that happens to you you can 
find some good if you look for it mrs dixon said and i didnt 
happen to find any good out of his her son rogers death until 17 
years later which is the vet center 
mrs barbour also credits the center with helping her cope she 
said shell go to her grave grieving for her son jimmy and if it 
hadnt been for this center id probably be there now 
she has adopted the centers veterans as her sons and they call 
her mom theyve laughed with her cried with her laid their heads 
on her shoulder 
when they say mom its rough he was my brother you feel 
like its a family and you feel like hes got to come walking in 
here soon 
but the place where they feel closest to their sons is the 
vietnam veterans memorial in washington and on friday the two 
women will make their annual veterans day pilgrimage to it 
the first trip to the wall after it was dedicated six years ago 
was overwhelming for mrs dixon 
when you look up there and see all those names she said 
all i could think about was all of the pain that all of those 
parents and wives and families as well as myself were still trying 
to deal with 
people dont understand they think because a boys been dead 
20 years that youre supposed to bury him and forget that he 
existed you cant do that its impossible to do that 
each time she goes mrs dixon leaves a letter for roger at the 
base of the wall 
the youngest of mrs dixons three children and her second son to 
serve in vietnam roger was 19 when he was drafted into the 25th 
infantry division on june 11 1968 
fortyfour days after his arrival in tay ninh roger was on 
patrol an american platoon mistook rogers group for viet cong and 
set off a mine roger was hit in the back the abdomen both legs 
and one arm four others were killed instantly he hung on for eight 
hours 
at the outreach center said mrs dixon i dont talk about the 
vietnam part of his life unless they ask me what happened to him i 
talk about the living part of his life his love of basketball 
his desire to make people laugh 
jimmy barbour the elder of two boys had always talked about 
jumping his mother recalled but that didnt lessen her shock when 
he walked in the door one day and announced he had joined the 
paratroopers he did well collecting 14 medals and citations that 
his mother keeps in a wood and glass case 
barbour was in the service 10 months and three days when he 
caught a bullet in the neck aug 27 1968 while pulling wounded out 
of the way of enemy fire in cu chi northwest of saigon 
mrs barbour received 14 shock treatments and was in and out of 
the hospital for 2 years 
people wouldnt believe how close we were how happy we were 
she said showing a family portrait of a smiling foursome mrs 
barbour her air force sergeant husband jimmy and her younger son 
wayne 
sometimes id like to stand on a big mountain and say love 
them its so easy to put your arms around them and tell them you 
love them but try going and putting flowers on their graves

marilyn quayle is the quintessential suburban 
mother involved in pta little league and school plays but she is 
also a lawyer with steely determination who induced labor for her 
first child so she could take the bar exam 
bright and ambitious the wife of vice presidentelect dan quayle 
had made no secret of her desire to return to work and pursue her 
own career this fall after more than a decade of postponing it for 
motherhood whether thats now possible being a washington lawyer 
who is also the vice presidents wife remains to be seen 
but at 39 mrs quayle sees herself as part of the vanguard of 
the future for women of her generation the first brought up to 
think that women shouldnt just look to get married that you should 
have a career 
theres no door closed weve all realized that theres no set 
role that a woman has to take and i can look at every opportunity 
and decide whats best for me without thinking of what is expected 
of me she said in a recent interview 
a lot was expected of her during the campaign and mrs quayle 
said she was pushed hard by having as much attention drawn to 
me 
republican strategists saw her as a weapon against the 
controversy that sometimes surrounded her husband quayle sometimes 
garbled his words and was flustered at tough questions she was 
always cool and prepared he did no major television interviews she 
did 2020 soon after the campaign began 
eddie mahe a republican political consultant who worked with the 
campaign says mrs quayle was viewed as someone who was better able 
to communicate with working women through shared experience and 
values than was her husband with all of his reputed good looks 
mrs quayle traveled the country on her own vigorous campaign 
schedule inevitably her crisp professional performance provoked 
comments only half in jest that she should be the vice 
presidential nominee 
rumor also put her in line for her husbands senate seat when he 
resigns insiders view that as unlikely although mrs quayle 
doesnt put an end to such speculation 
ill cross that bridge when i come to it she told one 
interviewer 
marilyn tucker was born in indianpolis the daughter of two 
physicians warren and mary alice tucker the family left the local 
presbyterian church for the teachings of col robert thieme a texas 
preacher known for unorthodox biblical interpretations and for 
verbal attacks on liberals welfare recipients homosexuals and 
others 
mrs quayle a fundamentalist admires thieme for his 
interpretation of the bible from original greek hebrew and latin 
versions she says she has no knowledge of his political 
pronouncements the family attends a virginia church that is part of 
the conservative presbyterian church in america 
the couple met while attending indiana university law school and 
she says swept each other off our feet they were married 10 
weeks later they have three children tucker benjamin and corinne 
mrs quayle says she induced labor in 1974 so she could deliver 
in time to take the indiana bar exam her doctor figured out 
exactly how many days before the bar exam i would be able to have 
tucker and still be able to sit through two days of the exam she 
said 
she doesnt consider that unusual adding that all my other 
kids were induced 
the quayles set up a law practice above the newspaper run by 
quayles father in huntington ind mrs quayle did most of the 
lawyering while her husband was associate publisher after his 
election to congress in 1976 she continued to work she soon 
stopped to become a fulltime mother but not to sit home eating bon 
bons and watching the soaps 
whether its working with study groups and doing research i 
do quite a bit of speaking ive managed to be able to contribute 
quite a bit i think in all different areas she said 
she is one of her husbands top advisers early in the campaign 
she was quite protective tugging on his sleeve to pull him away 
from the press she criticizes the media for what she says is a 
liberal bias and for scrutiny of her husbands military service 
academic record and personal life 
but resentment she says isnt part of my life she says she 
is not bitter for example that her career may once again be put on 
hold by her husbands vice presidency 
why be unhappy take every opportunity you have to make the 
best out of the situation you dont stew on things that might have 
been

an explosion today trapped three workmen in a 
sewer tunnel under construction and dangerous levels of methane gas 
forced rescuers to turn back the fire department said the workers 
condition was not immediately known 
deputy chief orville peterson said the men were trapped 
approximately 2000 feet into the tunnel and about 40 feet below the 
surface 
rescuers awaited equipment to remove the methane a byproduct of 
decomposition believed responsible for the explosion and pump in 
fresh air 
its too hazardous for anyone to go in at this time 
battalion chief norm luedke said with one little spark we will 
have another explosion 
it was not immediately known how long it would take for the 
equipment to arrive luedke declined to say whether the workers were 
still alive 
luedke head of the departments tunnel rescue unit said two 
rescuers went about 1200 feet into the tunnel but turned back after 
detecting methane levels of 6 percent he said a reading above 4 
percent is considered dangerous 
patrick doig project manager for the contractor sa healy co 
said 10 men were in the tunnel when a detection device showed high 
levels of methane 
all of the men left the tunnel he said and then three went back 
in to check gas levels that was when the explosion occurred he 
said 
the tunnel part of a 21 billion project to expand the citys 
sewage treatment and collection program will be used to store 
untreated sewage it is not yet connected to the existing sewer 
system 
methane is formed by the decomposition of organic matter and is 
found in sewers mines and marshes

declaring an independent

but many palestinians see the implied recognition of israel as a 
possible step toward peace 
after 11 months of revolt in the west bank and gaza strip in 
which more than 300 of them have been killed palestinians are 
frustrated that israel already has rejected the declaration expected 
at a weekend meeting of the palestine national council 
they hope however that basing the declaration on a 1947 un 
resolution that calls for arab and jewish states in palestine will 
convince western public opinion the palestine liberation 
organization wants to negotiate peace 
the plo has called on the palestine national council which meets 
saturday in algiers to declare an independent state in the occupied 
lands the arab league created the 450member council 24 years ago 
to serve as the palestinian legislature and not all its members 
belong to the plo 
dr hatem abu ghazala a prominent proplo palestinian in nablus 
said i do not take this declaration as merchandise to be sold to 
israel i am selling this idea to european and american public 
opinion 
he said he hopes western nations especially the united states 
will bring pressure on israel to begin peace talks when the plo has 
softened its position 
this is something new he said no longer is the plo 
denying the existence of israel a palestinian state declared 
through the plo will recognize the willingness of the plo to go to a 
peace conference with the israelis 
basing the independence declaration on un general assembly 
resolution 181 of 1947 could be interpreted as implicit recognition 
of israel but that probably will not satisfy conditions israel and 
the united states have set for dealing directly with the plo 
the 1968 plo covenant calling for armed struggle and destruction 
of the jewish state is another element in us and israeli 
opposition to direct dealings some palestinians say the plo can get 
around that by having a provisional government write a constitution 
to replace the covenant 
israels nov 1 parliamentary elections were indecisive but 
seemed to give the edge in forming a government to prime minister 
yitzhak shamir leader of the rightwing likud bloc 
shamir who opposes trading occupied land for peace has said 
israel would never accept a palestinian state and a declaration of 
independence would be an obstacle to peace because the arabs would 
have difficulty backing down from it 
foreign minister shimon peres of the rival labor party had 
instructions sent to israeli diplomats saying plo recognition of the 
un partition plan was irrelevant because of the arab attack on 
israel in 1948 
haidar abdulshafi head of the gaza strips red crescent 
society the moslem equivalent of the red cross said it would be a 
mistake to extend direct recognition to israel without something in 
return 
we are declaring we accept the twostate formula but theres a 
limit he said should we be expected to go farther to 
acknowledge israel when it claims all of the land 
support for the plo approach is far from universal among the 15 
palestinians of the occupied territories 
the islamic fundamentalist movement hamas zeal declared in in a 
leaflet distributed thursday if you sign an agreement with the 
jews in whose name do you speak no for the zionist state in the 
land of palestine yes to the armed struggle 
other palestinians want direct recognition of israel contending 
that would strengthen the political initiative provided by the 
uprising 
on a street in nablus where antiisraeli graffiti covered the 
walls 27yearold tailor nasser atoud said the pnc should make 
decisions which serve our interests if they dont take a decision 
to clearly recognize israel all the suffering will be in vain 
daoud kuttab a leading palestinian journalist said a 
declaration of independence will give people hope it encourages 
people to keep going

farm lawmakers said thursday that president 
reagans veto of a nutrition monitoring bill was unfortunate and 
unnecessary and vowed to push for passage again when congress 
reconvenes 
the presidents veto of nutrition monitoring legislation on 
election day is astonishing said a statement from the house and 
senate agriculture committees and nine other lawmakers including 
two republicans 
the bill vetoed wednesday by reagan called for a 10year 
assessment of the health and wellbeing of americans and the 
american diet with special focus on the elderly pregnant women 
infants children and the homeless 
under the bill the secretaries of agriculture and health and 
human services would have reviewed in advance any federal advice to 
consumers on what and what not to eat the provision was designed to 
make the federal government speak with one voice on nutrition and 
safety issues 
we believe the veto of this legislation was unfortunate and 
necessary the statement said we will press for passage of this 
legislation at the outset of the 101st congress which meets in 
january 
reagan said in vetoing the measure that the administration 
strongly supports the principal goals of this legislation and 
reaffirms its commitment to use existing authority to achieve these 
ends 
he said in a statement however that enactment of the bill 
would set up federal nutrition efforts on the wrong course 
the bill would create a substantial amount of unnecessary and 
complex federal bureaucracy that would hamper the achievement of the 
bills goals reagan said 
the congressional statement was signed by senate agriculture 
committee chairman patrick j leahy dvt and house agriculture 
committee chairman e kika de la garza dtexas as well as 
sens john glenn dohio rudy boschwitz rminn jeff bingaman 
dariz and tom harkin diowa and reps robert roe dnj 
george brown dcalif leon panetta dcalif doug walgren dpa 
and sherwood boehlert rny 
their statement quoted scott balin american heart association 
vice president and legislative counsel as saying the presidents 
veto of the bill does a serious disservice to the health and 
welfare of the american people 
we concur the lawmakers said

a report thursday blamed executive complacency and 
an uncoordinated haphazard and untrained staff response in last 
years subway fire that killed 31 people in the london undergrounds 
worst tragedy 
the transit systems top two executives resigned as the report 
was released eight days before the first anniversary of the nov 18 
1987 fire that erupted in busy kings cross station in the heart of 
the capital 
sir keith bright chairman of london regional transport that 
controls the london underground resigned wednesday night and tony 
ridley london undergrounds chairman and chief executive quit 
thursday 
the blaze at the end of evening rush hour was the worst 
accident in the 120year history of the system 
among the points made by desmond fennell the lawyer who headed 
the 91day investigation 
the fire was caused by a lighted match falling through a gap 
beside escalator treads it ignited grease and fluff on the 
escalator tracks and funneled flames upward to a ticketing plaza 
that became an inferno 
staff at kings cross were woefully illequipped never 
applying a drop of water or using a single fire extinguisher 
their overall response may be characterized as uncoordinated 
haphazard and untrained and there was a general failure to 
appreciate the severity of the disaster 
london underground was lulled into a false sense of security 
because no previous escalator fire had caused a death its 
blinkered approach held that fires were inevitable on the 
oldest and most extensive underground system in the world 
management had a blind spot over the hazards of fire on 
escalators and had a rule withdrawn only after the blaze always 
to refer to fires as smolderings 
fennell wrote that london underground had no system for training 
staff in fire drill or evacuation 
the report said bright was mistaken as to his responsibility 
over his boards failure to monitor safety as strictly as it 
monitored its finances 
the management had failed to put a high priority on safety 
because no one was in overall charge of the matter annual fire 
brigade inspections conducted at london undergrounds invitation 
were inadequate the report said 
london undergrounds management under ridley was 
fundamentally in error in regarding fires as inevitable it said 
the report made 157 recommendations for the biggest shakeup the 
transit system has known they ranged from organizational changes to 
physical measures such as removing wood paneling and installing tv 
monitors and smoke detectors 
ridley in a resignation statement called the report an 
emotive document but did not criticize it outright 
bright made no comment but transport secretary paul channon who 
ordered the inquiry said the 57yearold executive had offered to 
resign immediately after the fire but i asked him to stay during a 
difficult period and he did 
he promised the government would act on the reports 
recommendations as quickly and as vigorously as possible he 
said 476 million would be spent over the next three years to make 
stations safer 
but the opposition labor party sought to fix the blame on the 
ruling conservative party saying its budgetcutting doctrines 
pressured london underground into cutting corners on safety in order 
to reduce its dependency on government subsidies 
families of the dead are considering a private prosecution of the 
management 
sophie tarassenko whose brother ivan perished said she felt 
relief when she read the report 
it has been a furstrating 12 months where everyone seemed to be 
washing their hands of the whole business she said we are glad 
the report names names and we think it was right for sir keith 
bright and dr tony ridley to resign

the percentage of new us military recruits with 
aids infections is decreasing apparently because more men who fear 
they may be infected arent signing up federal health officials 
said thursday 
in the first six months of the militarys testing program for the 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome beginning in october 1985 15 
out of every 10000 recruits were found to show signs of aids virus 
infection 
however between october 1987 and march 1988 12 in every 10000 
recruits were infected the national centers for disease control 
reported 
our leading hypothesis is that it reflects selfdeferral among 
highrisk applicants people who know they have aids virus 
infections or suspect they might be at increased risk are not 
coming into the recruitment centers said dr marta gwinn an aids 
specialist with the atlantabased cdc 
one reason researchers believe highrisk recruits may be staying 
away is that although there has been a statistically significant 
decrease in aids infection among male recruits infection rates 
among female recruits who may be less likely to think they are 
infected have stayed largely constant the cdc said in its weekly 
report 
the rate of aids infection among male recruits has dropped from 
17 per 10000 in initial testing to 12 in the latest numbers while 
the rate for female recruits has risen from seven per 10000 to 
eight 
women may be less aware of their risk for infection the 
cdc said only 9 percent of all us aids cases have occurred in 
females homosexual or bisexual males account for 68 percent 
the military has tested more than 15 million recruits for aids 
infection more than 2100 or 01 percent have tested positive 
federal health officials estimate that about 06 percent of the us 
population is infected with the aids virus 
although aids infection rates are lower among military recruits 
than the public largely because gay men and drug users are subject 
to exclusion from military service the military test results are 
still of interest to researchers ms gwinn said 
if the incidence of infection were to decline we might detect 
it first in the youngest age groups she said noting that 
military recruits tend to be in their late teens or early 20s 
were we to see a dramatic decline in the youngest age group it 
would be potentially encouraging she added that is not what is 
happening at the present time though

wholesale price inflation slowed to zero last 
month as food costs dropped for the first time since february 
reflecting an easing of the effects of the summer drought the 
government said thursday 
freshfruit prices plummeted 92 percent to lead a 01 percent 
decline in food prices on the wholesale level the labor department 
said large drops also occurred in prices for vegetables pasta 
fish beef pork and cooking oils food prices had been climbing at 
an annual rate of 8 percent before the reversal 
while the turnaround indicated the initial effects of the driest 
summer in decades on food prices are over analysts said consumers 
can expect a second round of droughtrelated increases next spring 
when shortages of meat and pork appear because of 
earlierthannormal slaughters this year 
its just temporary said michael evans who runs a private 
economic forecasting firm in washington next year well see the 
lag effects of the drought and food prices will be up sharply 
again 
wholesale prices increases for food have totaled 45 percent over 
the past 12 months paralleling the rate of consumer price inflation 
in general but including energy and other products wholesale 
prices overall are only 29 percent above a year ago 
international competition is still forcing the industrial 
sector to fight cost increases ever more vigorously said cynthia 
latta an economist with data resources inc in lexington mass 
there was a bunch of aberrations last month that added up to 
zero and that certainly is good news ms latta said but i 
dont think we should stop worrying about inflation 
energy prices rose a slight 03 percent in october as a 46 
percent increase in natural gas prices caused primarily by shortages 
in the northeast was offset by a 101 percent decline in home 
heating oil prices and no change in gasoline prices 
energy prices are still 57 percent below what they were a year 
ago and analysts said they expect them to begin falling again by 
spring 
before the seasonal adjustments the labor departments producer 
price index for all finished goods including energy and food 
rose 06 percent to 1093 
that means that a hypothetical selection of goods costing 100 at 
the wholesale level in 1982 would have cost 10930 last month the 
same basket of goods would have cost 10860 in september and 
10770 a year ago 
the seasonal adjustment process is designed to remove 
predictable periodic influences from the calculation of price 
changes 
analysts said the difference between the seasonally adjusted 
prices and real ones was primarily connected with the introduction 
of 1989model automobiles 
after the seasonal adjustments which are intended to spread out 
the effect of auto price hikes associated with the introduction of 
new 1989 models new car prices fell 17 percent 
the introduction of new models are strung out now instead of 
being lumped into september and october and the seasonal adjustments 
dont reflect the changes as well as they used to said ms latta 
the labor department estimated the value of quality changes in 
the new 1989 models such as governmentmandated passive 
restraints new corrosion protection and improvements in power 
trains at 15369 per vehicle or 346 percent of the average 
44408 increase in price to dealers 
alcoholic beverage prices rose 06 percent on the wholesale level 
last month after declining by 03 percent in september the labor 
department said 
womens and mens apparel costs were up 01 percent and 02 
percent respectively while prices for childrens clothing fell 03 
percent after rising 06 percent in the backtoschool buying month 
of september 
prescription drug prices rose 04 percent and were 93 percent 
above what they were a year earlier cosmetics rose 05 percent on 
october but were only 29 percent higher than during the same month 
in 1987 
household furniture prices rose 08 percent last month and were 
45 percent above what they were a year ago including a 05 percent 
decline last month wholesale prices for household appliances have 
risen only 07 percent in the last year 
also pacing the slight drop in food costs last month were 
declines of 19 percent for fresh vegetables 58 percent for pasta 
09 percent for fish 40 percent for cooking oils and 16 percent 
for beef and pork 
offsetting them were increases of 19 percent for processed 
chickens 80 percent for turkeys 73 percent for eggs and 10 
percent for canned fruits and vegetables 
prices for intermediate goods further back in the production 
chain items such as plastic parts cement paints fertilizers 
lumber and chemicals also were flat in october but 53 percent 
higher than a year earlier 
raw material prices for crude products such as oil agricultural 
commodities scrap aluminium iron ore and timber declined 01 
percent last month and are only 05 percent above what they were a 
year ago the labor department said

the opinion polls ended the presidential election 
on a harmonious note most of them predicted the outcome fairly 
accurately if none precisely 
the final preelection polls did not hit the elections numbers 
right on the head 54 percent to 46 percent for republican george 
bush over democrat michael dukakis 
but they were close with estimates of bushs lead ranging from 
four to 11 points cbs news came nearest to the actual spread its 
final national survey tuesday morning found a 5243 percent bush 
lead a ninepoint margin 
an abc newswashington post poll was next closest putting it at 
10 points and abc pollsters won bragging rights on another score 
they exactly predicted bushs total in their 5444 percent estimate 
better than that a huge 50state abcpost poll done the week 
before the election came extremely close to predicting bushs total 
in the electoral college it put him ahead for 439 electoral votes 
he won 426 
im very happy said abcs chief pollster jeff alderman 
we had a very very good year 
other polls were a tad farther off on the outcome at one end of 
the scale gallup had an 11point bush lead in its last poll 5342 
percent and a usa todaycnn poll also had an 11point bush lead 
5544 
at the other end an nbc newswall street journal survey 
estimated a fivepoint bush lead 4843 and the final harris poll 
had it at four 5147 
reasons for the disparity included the varying methods of 
identifying who is most likely to vote and also the pollsters 
efforts to apportion at least some of the voters who said they were 
undecided or only leaning 
only gallup was brave enough before the election to try an 
estimate of how all its undecideds would vote it arrived at a 5644 
percent result a 12point bush margin but even that estimate was 
within the margin of sampling error of the outcome 
we have a lot of people disappointed here that we didnt hit it 
right on the nose i said god every time youre within sampling 
error youve done your job said gallup pollster larry hugick 
some of our people remember the last time and theyre spoiled 
the last time was the 1984 election when gallup applying the 
same methods estimated a ronald reagan victory of 5941 percent he 
won 5941 
a certain part of this said hugick is just luck

an african ground hornbill who flew the 
coop at the louisville zoo has returned to captivity but it may 
have been luck not love that ended his freedom 
the 5yearold bird abandoned his mate violet on monday morning 
possibly because he was unhappy about sharing his digs with the 
kudu an antelope or it could have been that violet was ignoring 
his mating overtures in which he made ostentatious displays and 
carried twigs to her whats worse zoo workers havent even gotten 
around to naming him 
the bird spent the night in some nearby woods and returned home 
tuesday 
zoo curator john keeley said he was unsure if he came back 
because of violet whether he was familiar with the area and wanted 
to get back to the exhibit or if our catching him was just dumb 
luck 
the bird which is two feet tall and has a bright orange face 
with an eightinch beak was cornered by keeler and his staff in 
tall weeds along the zoo fence 
violet didnt seem terribly concerned about her mates 
disappearance keeley said 
she didnt pace the yard or seem upset that he left at all 
he said 
now that the pair is together again zoo officials hope the 
winter cold will rekindle their courtship 
we obviously want to get some breeding going he said so 
were going to try some different things next spring

two specialists from zaire and egypt says 
they have developed a new form of their experimental treatment for 
aids which they plan to try on four american patients 
the vaccine named mm2 was developed by professor zirimwabago 
lurhuma of zaire and professor ahmed shafik of egypt and has been 
administered to animals in preliminary tests 
the mm2 is an improved version of their vaccine mm1 without 
its sideeffects of mm1 notably the pain and fever lurhuma told a 
news conference wednesday 
it is to be tried shortly on a group of four american aids 
patients who came specially from the united states for the 
treatment supervised by american specialists the american patients 
and doctors were not identified 
shafik said it was possible that other american patients would 
come to kinshasa soon to undergo the treatment 
the treatment consists of about 20 injections spread over three 
months followed by a threemonth rest period at the end of the 
rest period many cases of remission had been observed lurhuma said 
we want to let as much time go by as possible to judge the 
effectiveness of the method lurhuma said 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring

thousands of dutch policemen took 
to the streets thursday to protest a governmentproposed 
restructuring of pay scales and what they claim amounts to a 
nationwide manpower reduction 
in amsterdam alone an estimated 1500 members of the municipal 
police force took part in a rush hour demonstration that caused 
chaos in the city center a police spokesman said 
action leaders also announced a 12hour slowdown in law 
enforcement meaning that only the most serious cases will be 
acted upon according to spokesman berry wolven 
similar demonstrations involving another 1000 policemen were 
reported in rotterdam the worlds largest port and the southern 
dutch city of tilburg 
at issue is a government report proposing to restructure police 
pay scales which police unions claim would entail serious cuts in 
overtime pay 
the report also recommended a huge reorganization of the 
netherlands police force involving the transfer of about 2600 
officers from rural forces to the big cities 
were fearing that such a reorganization will also lead to 
force reductions wolven said 
the reports recommendations have not yet been adopted by premier 
ruud lubbers centerright government which came to power in 1986 
on a strong anticrime platform promising to increase the size of 
the police force

an ageold economic principle encouraging price 
competition can help reduce escalating hospital costs according 
to a study 
the study provides the first evidence that new laws intended to 
increase competition among hospitals can help moderate or reverse 
the rise in costs said health economist glenn a melnick of the 
university of californialos angeles school of public health 
but melnick cautioned that more research is needed to determine 
what impact these policies may have on the quality of care research 
and education and medical services to the poor 
the question arises were costs lowered by becoming more 
efficient or did patientcare quality suffer said melnick 
who coauthored the study published in fridays journal of the 
american medical association 
a spokesman for the westchester illbased healthcare financial 
management association an organization representing 26000 
financial managers of hospitals and other health care facilities 
said increased price competition was a mixed blessing 
the competition is having some positive effect in dampening 
unnecessary expenditures for new services that might be duplicated 
at a nearby hospital said association spokesman charles mowll 
but there is a downside to that in that patient convenience and 
access to care is being diminished and as a practical matter 
youre going to see longer waiting lines in hospital outpatient 
departments he said 
there has been no significant indication that quality has been 
impacted yet but we certainly have fears that you can only tighten 
the screws so much until quality will suffer 
the study examined the impact on all 450 california hospitals of 
a 1982 state law that allowed the state medicaid program and private 
insurers to negotiate favorable terms from certain hospitals without 
fear of antitrust action 
the selective contracting law was the first in the country 
intended to encourage healthcare price competition 
melnick and coauthor jack zwanziger of the rand corp said that 
previous studies of hospital competition indicated that competition 
based on the quality of doctors equipment or other amenities led 
only to higher costs the california law was unique in that it was 
intended to foster costreducing competition 
since its passage similar legislation has been enacted in more 
than half the states spurring a boom in healthcare maintenance and 
preferred provider organization insurance plans melnick said 
the study found that costs among all california hospitals 
adjusted for inflation rose an average 48 percent a year between 
198082 but decreased 04 percent annually from 198385 after the 
new law took effect 
in the most competitive urban centers total inflationadjusted 
inpatient costs actually decreased a total of 113 percent in 
198385 inpatient costs for hospitals in lowcompetition markets 
or markets with very few hospitals increased by less than 1 percent 
during the same period 
hospitals and physicians located in areas with many competitors 
or substantial excess capacity are more likely to agree to accept 
lower fees in return for the promise of a continued flow of 
patients the study said 
given current national trends the behavior now observed in 
california is likely to spread to the rest of the country 
melnick said hospital management had been able to adapt very 
rapidly and in dramatic ways to cut cost in what has 
traditionally been an industry not considered to be very 
entrepreneurial 
the study found that patients were spending less time on average 
in hospitals and that there was a significant shift from inpatient 
to outpatient services with hospitals competing directly with 
doctors for ambulatory care

soda machines that tip over when rocked by people 
wanting their money back or a free drink can maim or kill and should 
be fixed so they wont fall an army doctor said thursday 
in a study published in fridays journal of the american medical 
association michael cosio of the walter reed army medical center in 
washington documented 11 deaths from falling soda machines 
one victim was found pinned to a wall with the soda machine 
resting on his neck death was presumed to be due to suffocation 
others were crushed to death or asphyxiated 
if you look at it from the victims standpoint if they get 
hurt if a machine lands on them they have a 20 perent to 25 
percent chance that they get killed cosio said in a telephone 
interview 
changes are needed to safeguard the public he said and a 
spokesman for the consumer product safety commission said the agency 
is investigating the problem 
few people would believe that a soda vending machine can be 
tipped over or that anyone would be foolish enough to even try to 
tip such a machine cosio wrote in the study not only can these 
machines be tipped over but they can injure and even kill 
cosio looked at accidents involving 15 males at military 
installations overseas from july 1985 to september 1987 three were 
killed and 12 victims required hospitalization 
a followup of 32 more males some civilians documented eight 
more deaths he said 
the victims all were shaking or rocking the machines he said 
some to shake loose a soda without paying others because theyre 
angry at the machine for keeping their money and not dispensing a 
soda 
i usually just bang on the front or jiggle the coin return and 
if it doesnt work i just walk away cosio said 
the machines generally weigh 800 pounds to 1000 pounds but when 
not anchored they can be tipped over without much force he said 
weve even had a 10yearold child who got killed 
survivors made the same or similar statement about the descent 
of the machine he wrote in essence each victim said it came 
down faster than i thought i pushed up but it was too heavy and it 
kept coming i tried to get out of the way but it caught me 
ken giles a spokesman for the federal consumer safety agency 
said it is investigating and yes of course we consider it a 
problem we havent decided what to do about it 
it appears that these deaths and injuries are related to one 
brand giles said but he declined to identify which one because 
of the continuing investigation 
if we can pin it down as a brandname specific problem then we 
can work for repair or replacement or some other remedial 
measure he said 
cosio said machines that dispense free sodas when rocked should 
be removed from the market and others should be secured to the 
floor or wall to help avert tipovers

american voters showed again this week a 
ticketsplitting bent that some pundits say has created a new 
extraconstitutional check on the balance of power in the nations 
capital 
republican presidentelect george bush will have a solidly 
democratic house and senate to contend with and the democrats also 
padded their lead tuesday in both governorships and state 
legislatures 
whatever happened to the yellowdog democrats the ones who 
supposedly would vote for a yellow dog if it ran as a democrat or 
to any yellowdog republicans for that matter why is the 
electorate so fickle when it comes to following the party line 
this was a unique situation where the candidate of a winning 
party for president saw his side lose in senators house and 
governors said gop analyst kevin phillips publisher of the 
american political report 
phillips citing wall street journalnbc news exit polling saw 
a sort of negative coattails effect with some voters the 
sense that you had to set one bunch to watch the others 
michael dukakis who had an awful time trying to dodge bushs 
charge that he was a freebooting bigspending liberal lost the key 
industrial state of ohio by 10 points and nearly a halfmillion 
votes 
but bush wasnt the biggest votegetter in the buckeye state 
that honor went to incumbent democratic sen howard metzenbaum who 
piled up a 5743 margin in trouncing challenger george voinovich 
the republican mayor of cleveland 
metzenbaum is one of the most outspoken liberals in the senate 
and is arguably to the left of dukakis as voinovich constantly 
tried to remind ohio voters 
william schneider the american enterprise institute political 
analyst said metzenbaum had the image of a populist a fighter a 
tough aggressive campaigner who delivered for the people of ohio 
but metzenbaum would not have carried ohio as a presidential 
candidate schneider said 
the higher the office the more ideology matters and the more 
ideology matters the worse democrats do he said the public 
feels safe in voting democratic for lower offices because frankly 
ideology values philosophy seldom get engaged in local and state 
races 
robert strauss the former democratic party chief now cochairing 
the national economic commisssion said the closer to home you 
get the more the people vote democratic we do well in cities as 
well as in counties and state legislatures the democratic party is 
still the oldest largest political party in the world and its 
stil closer to the people than any political party in the world 
ben wattenberg a senior fellow at the american enterprise 
institute said people intuitively if they are not in favor of 
divided government they obviously have nothing against it 
you can make a pretty good founding fatherscase that that kind 
of government makes a certain degree of sense he said 
stephen hess a brookings institution senior fellow rejects the 
idea that the people are imposing a new type of 
extraconstitutional check and balance on the politicians in 
washington 
i think whats happend is that we have very weak parties and 
the american people dont care theyre indifferent to this hess 
said people now without the moorings of party are extremely 
interested in personality character and results 
he added it doesnt offend them or even perhaps much interest 
them whether they vote for a democrat for governor and then turn 
around and vote for a republican for senator and then a democrat 
for house of representatives and so forth in some political 
pingpong

a request by yasser arafat chairman of the 
palestine liberation organization for a visa to address the united 
nations would be subjected to severe scrutiny the state department 
said thursday 
our view of the plo hasnt changed spokesman charles e 
redman said 
arab diplomats in new york spread word this week that arafat 
would like to participate when the general assembly considers the 
middle east situation later this year 
redman said the united nations had asked the state department 
to facilitate the issuance of a visa 
arafat spoke to the assembly in 1974 appealing to its members to 
aid our people in its struggle to attain its right to 
selfdetermination 
concluding his address the plo chief said he had come bearing 
an olive branch and a freedom fighters gun do not let the olive 
branch fall from my hand 
the plo is sworn by its covenant to the destruction of israel it 
has been implicated by the state department in incidents of 
terrorism against americans and israelis 
secretary of state george p shultz has told congress that he had 
no desire whatever to see arafat in the united states he made 
the comment in a letter responding to a request from 51 senators to 
deny arafat a visa 
redman said we will severely scrutinize any application for a 
visa in light of applicable laws and regulations and other pertinent 
circumstances he declined to elaborate 
under the united nations headquarters agreement of 1947 the 
united states is not supposed to impose any impediment to 
transit of people involved in the united nations on official 
business 
on the other hand congress has authorized the denial of visas to 
supporters of terrorism 
a us official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
strictures on obtaining a visa for un business were less severe than 
if he wanted to come down to washington or to go someplace else 
the state departments office to counter terrorism has linked the 
plos executive committee to known terrorists 
the israeli government and jewish groups have protested a visit 
by the plo leader who has never renounced the provision in his 
organizations covenant calling for the dismantling of the jewish 
state 
we do not deem arafat welcome in any international forum 
said barukh binah spokesman for the israeli un mission but the 
un commited the original sin the acceptance of the plo which is 
a terrorist organization in the first place 
the plo has never changed its covenent which still calls for 
the destruction of israel he said and has never renounced 
terrorism or accepted un resolutions 242 and 338 which 
recognize israels right to exist within secure borders

two burned empty lifeboats were found thursday on 
an oily patch of the north atlantic but there were no signs of the 
27 crewmen from a tanker that broke in two in stormy seas and burst 
into flames searchers said 
a canadian military plane flew over the wreckage of the odyssey 
and found its bow barely afloat said paul kendrick of the 
canadian search and rescue coordination center in halifax nova 
scotia 
the stern section of the 65746ton tanker sank after the vessel 
cracked in half oil spilled into the ocean and caught fire coating 
the surface with flames that burned hours later 
kendrick said none of the greek and honduras crewmen was seen on 
the bow or in the two badly burned lifeboats floating in the area 
he said the tanker was also believed to carry two life rafts 
if we cant find them theres not much hope kendrick said 
photographs taken of the scene will be analyzed to see if there are 
any signs of the crewmen he said 
the odyssey a liberianregistered vessel sent out a distress 
signal at 322 am about 1000 miles east of newfoundland saying 
it needed immediate assistance coast guard officials said 
the soviet weather passat was the first vessel to reach the 
odyssey it was 26 miles away when the distress signal was sent out 
and rushed to help but flaming oil kept the passat from getting 
closer than a mile to the stricken vessel said british and canadian 
coast guard officials 
polembros shipping ltd of london operators of the odyssey said 
the tanker had a greek captain 14 greek officers and 12 honduran 
sailors 
i am afraid that we have heard nothing at all of survivors

it doesnt sound very good at all said a british coast guard 
spokesman in falmouth who by custom was not identified the 
soviet vessel has lost radio contact with the tanker 
in addition to the passat another vessel the bulk carrier 
maritime wisdom responded to the distress call and was searching 
for survivors kendrick said the air search would last into the 
night

reported an oil slick 10 miles long and three miles wide in the area 
lloyds said the odyssey left sullom voe a scottish oil 
terminal on nov 5 and was heading for the canadian port of come by 
chance when it broke apart 
the canadian coast guard reported stormy weather with winds of 43 
mph and high seas and swells lloyds said the canadian aircraft 
reported visibility was reasonable for searching aircraft but not 
for surface vessels 
the odyssey was built in 1971 and owned by diamond port shipping 
corp of monrovia liberia

the super collider texas will name for president reagan was an 
economic dream for the six other finalists for the 44 billion atom 
smasher and some losers complained thursday that politics played a 
part in the site selected 
gov rose mofford of arizona one of the losing states noted 
that the annoucement was made only 48 hours after the election 
of texan george bush for president 
the governor of another losing state wasnt necessarily blaming 
politics but money colorado will compete on its merits said 
roy romer it is not going to buy it this state doesnt have to 
pay for people to come here 
he said colorado offered no financial incentives for the project 
texas voters approved a 11 billion bond package that would reduce 
the federal cost of building the atom smasher in waxahachie south 
of dallas 
the other losers were illinois michigan north carolina and 
tennessee the seven were chosen from a field of 25 bidding states 
by an independent panel appointed by the department of energy 
energy secretary john herrington said in making the announcement 
in washington that the texas site was superior to the others 
colorado state sen jim brandon a republican said the does 
decision was political engineered in washington through influence 
of texans jim wright us house speaker and lloyd bentsen 
chairman of the senate finance committee 
politics suited a jubilant texas gov bill clements just fine 
the icing on the cake is the very special relationship between 
ronald reagan and texas 
the texas decision has a strong smell of white house 
politics said sen donald riegle dmich that was our major 
concern all along the michigan application was clearly better than 
the texas proposal we and the other five finalist states got a raw 
deal 
in waxahachie where the 53mile doughnutshaped hole in the 
ground will go most were celebrating the project that would bring 
4000 construction jobs in four to five years plus 3500 permanent 
jobs to the community of 18000 
tennessee gov ned mcwherter said he thought the project may have 
trouble getting funding 
if i were a member of the united states congress the united 
states senate or had anything to do with the presidency the no 1 
thing i would do next january is start in the direction of balancing 
the budget regardless of what had to be done he said 
congress has appropriated 205 million for the collider 
including 100 million for research and development in fiscal 1989 
but has not authorized its construction 
sen john mccain rariz said he doubted presidential politics 
played a role since congress still has to provide the money 
but he also said if theres a taint of politicalization then 
this project will never become a reality 
this is a very political animal said david brooks chairman 
of the granville county commissioners in north carolina one of the 
proposed sites i think politics played into it and they have more 
political clout down there 
but the head of the physics department at fermilab in illinois 
dan green looked at it another way he said the selection of a site 
was really a good sign that america wants to support high energy 
physics and wants to support basic research and wants to recapture a 
position they have been frittering away

singer john denver who has said he wants to fly in 
a soviet spacecraft apparently has balked at the 10 million price 
he said the soviets wanted him to pay 
alexander dunaev head of the soviet commercial space agency 
glavkosmos told a news conference thursday that a us singer 
had failed to meet a nov 1 application deadline set by the soviets 
we havent gotten a serious request from him dunaev said 
without identifying the singer by name 
denver had said last month that he had until nov 1 to accept a 
very serious invitation to fly aboard a soviet spacecraft but 
he said the soviets insistence that he pay 10 million would likely 
prompt him to drop the project 
ive told them that im opposed to paying 10 million that i 
think its inappropriate that i think its negative and that its 
not the way i want to pursue this endeavor denver had said 
for that fee denver said the soviets told him he could fly 
aboard a soviet spacecraft and spend time aboard the mir space 
station at this point they have a slot open for me december of 
next year he said 
dunaev did not mention a specific price tag set for denver but 
indicated it would go up 
if he expresses the desire again it will be much more 
expensive for him he said 
one western musical act will be going into space with the soviets 
this month if only in the form of a recording officials told 
reporters that a special recording had been made by the british pop 
music group pink floyd for a joint sovietfrench spaceflight 
scheduled for nov 26

israeli troops in the occupied gaza strip 
wounded 12 palestinians on thursday and blew up the homes of nine 
accused of attacking soldiers with grenades or firebombs 
islamic fundamentalists urged the palestine national council 
which convenes saturday in algiers to wage an armed struggle 
against israel and criticized those who favor peace negotiations 
a leaflet distributed by a group called hamas zeal said who 
authorized the pnc to sign a peace agreement with the jews is it 
the palestinian martyrs is it the wounded is it the palestinian 
child who lost an eye sitting in his mothers lap 
we announce clearly no to a zionist state in the land of 
palestine no to peace with murderers yes to the armed 
struggle 
the 450member pnc which serves as a palestinian legislature is 
expected to declare an independent state in the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip where 11 israelis and at least 310 palestinians have 
been killed in an 11monthold rebellion against israeli occupation 
its declaration is expected to recognize israel indirectly by 
accepting a 1947 un general assembly resolution that called for 
dividing palestine into jewish and arab states 
israeli troops are expected to seal off the occupied territories 
during the palestine national council meeting barring journalists 
without escorts and prohiting palestinians from traveling to and 
from israel 
in the gaza strip maj gen yitzhak mordechai said the 
demolition of nine houses was a lesson to palestinians that those 
who try to hurt us with grenades and firebombs will find themselves 
hurt 
he said the houses belonged to two palestinians who hurled 
grenades at army patrols and members of a gang accused of firebomb 
attacks on soldiers two soldiers were slightly wounded in a grenade 
attack oct 12 
we found five more grenades a pistol an m16 rifle dynamite 
sticks plastic explosives and other weapons mordechai said on 
israel radio he is chief of the armys southern command 
palestinians told law in the service of man a human rights group 
founded by arab lawyers that soldiers bulldozed 72 houses in the 
jifliq shantytown near a settlement where an israeli soldier was 
stabbed to death monday 
army spokesmen said residents who had settled in jifliq illegally 
were being forced to return to their home villages they would not 
reveal the number of houses knocked down 
in the west bank soldiers raided seven palestinian homes 
overnight in the nablus marked district palestinian witnesses 
reported they said it was the third such action in as many days 
the daily maariv said the raids were intended to prevent violence 
during the pnc meeting and several palestinians were detained 
palestinians confirmed a report in the jerusalem post daily that 
soldiers smashed windows vandalized furniture and beat residents 
then ordered them into the streats to remove barricades from roads 
and paint over antiisraeli graffiti the army said it was checking 
the report 
violent confrontations were reported in our gaza strip refugee 
camps arab hospital officials said soldiers shot and wounded 12 
palestinians including a 14yearold girl and two boys aged 13 and 
15 
military authorities imposed curfews on several refugee camps 
confining 173000 palestinians to their homes 
members of the jerusalembased arab journalists association 
demanded the immediate release of 24 palestinian reporters who have 
been in jail for six months without trial under emergency 
regulations 
these are repressive measures aimed at depriving the 
palestinian people of knowing what is happening in the occupied 
territories hanna siniora editor of the proplo daily al fajr 
said at a news conference

george bush as president is likely to be more 
of a handson manager than ronald reagan more interested in foreign 
policy less ideological 
the man who promises a kinder and gentler nation also says the 
stillness of the white house will be broken when he takes over by 
the sound of 10 grandchildren laughing and crying 
the jelly bean jars in the reagan white house probably will be 
replaced with stacks of cracklin pork rinds bushs favorite snack 
reagans favorite magazine was human events a conservative 
political journal bushs favorite is bassmaster a fishing 
journal 
bush 64 is lefthanded he likes country music vodka martinis 
and mexican food he jogs several times a week covering two miles 
in about 18 minutes 
for fun he races his cigarette boat off the chilly waters of 
maine hes an avid tennis player and fisherman and also likes to 
play horseshoes 
an episcopalian he attends church regularly with his wife 
barbara theyve been married 43 years they have five children all 
adults now and dote on their 10 grandchildren 
in 71 days bush will take over from a popular president who 
charmed the nation with his easygoing manner wit and polished 
communications skills 
bush readily acknowledges hes different 
i may not be the most eloquent but i learned early that 
eloquence wont draw oil from the ground bush said last summer 
i may sometimes be a little awkward but theres nothing 
selfconscious in my love of country i am a quiet man but i hear 
the quiet people others dont 
on another occasion he said my leadership might not be the 
most charismatic but im not sure that we need a lot of razzle 
dazzle theres probably enough drama in the world already 
conservatives are worried that bush although he took a hard line 
during his presidential campaign will turn into a moderate in the 
white house 
indeed his political leanings have drifted over the years bush 
was a goldwater republican in 1966 when he was first elected to 
congress a rockefeller republican in 1980 when he ran for president 
and a reagan republican ever since 
i suspect that george bush will want a staff that includes sort 
of credentialed experts as opposed to ideological soul mates around 
him said republican consultant david keene who once worked for 
bush 
the difference between the styles of reagan and bush is that 
bush is out of an intellectual and political tradition in which the 
emphasis is on finding the right people in public service seeking 
their advice and believing that goals come out of having the right 
people in the right places said keene 
bush is considered more pragmatic and issueoriented than reagan 
as a onetime envoy to china and the united nations as well as chief 
of the cia bush has a solid foundation in foreign policy 
reagan in his first year in office practically ignored foreign 
policy devoting his attention to budget and tax cuts bush says he 
wants a nato summit conference and an early meeting with soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev 
stephen hess a senior fellow in governmental studies at the 
brookings institution said that reagan is the most handsoff 
manager of the modern presidency i suspect that george bush will be 
not nearly as hands off 
echoing that theme lyn nofziger who was reagans first 
political director in the white house said bush would be probably 
more involved in the presidency and the daytoday operations but 
probably not a hell of a lot more hes not a jimmy carter or 
michael dukakis both carter and dukakis are known for their 
attention to detail 
hess said bush certainly seems to share reagans disdain for 
the press he too doesnt see being too close to the press as 
being in his interest 
though bush has promised to stay the course set by reagan hess 
said each president wants to do things differently than the person 
he succeeds 
what kind of president hell be will depend largely on things 
that happen the next four years that are largely out of his control 
whether the iranians take over the us embassy in tehran or 
something like that hess said there are going to be some 
things that happen in the next four years in which the mettle of the 
man will have to be assessed 
on that very point bush told an audience recently that the oval 
office was a place for the moments that cut through the expected 
and the everyday and force us through action to define ourselves 
i dont know what the cutting moments will be for the next 
president bush said but i know theyll come and i know im 
ready

aids can invade immature blood cells in the 
bone marrow and turn them into bags of virus that may be major 
reservoirs for the fatal immune deficiency disease researchers 
reported in a new study 
thomas m folks head of a virology laboratory at the federal 
centers for disease control in atlanta said thursday that the 
finding confirms that the aids virus is able to infect and reproduce 
within stem cells immature cells that grow in the bone marrow and 
develop into components of the blood 
this is probably a cell that helps set up the reservoir of 
infection and allows the disease to become chronic and linger for a 
long period of time folks said in a telephone interview 
folks said he and a team of researchers used a new technique to 
purify stem cells from bone marrow extracted from a cadaver 
the stem cells then were exposed to human immunodeficiency virus 
or hiv that causes aids and then cultured in test tubes 
after 40 or 50 days the cells in the culture became packed 
with hiv virus folks said the cells became bags of virus 
the infected cells developed into macrophages a type of cell 
that fights disease by engulfing and digesting bacteria or other 
infective agents 
folks said for people infected with aids macrophages may develop 
into bags of virus that actually can spread the infection to 
other parts of the body 
it may be that these stem cells get infected with aids and then 
they move to the brain or the lungs or whereever macrophages might 
roam folks said 
he said this is speculation since his study was done only in 
test tubes but he said the study did show that macrophages can 
become so engorged with viruses that the cell finally bursts and the 
viral products re released 
folks said the virus develops differently in the stem cell than 
it does in the tcell another type of blood cell attacked by hiv 
in the tcell the virus creates buds on the cell surface these 
buds can become a target of antibodies but in the stem cell the 
virus reproduces within the cell wall and there is no clue on the 
outside that would attract attack by antibodies 
for this reason he said the bone marrow cells may form a 
reservoir of disease that would be difficult to attack with a 
vaccine 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a fatal disease 
that can spread by an exchange of body fluids such as in sexual 
contact transfusion by infected blood products sharing of infected 
needles or from birthing mother to child the disease kills by 
disabling the bodys immune system and making it unable to resist 
other infections 
as of oct 17 1988 aids had been diagnosed in 75768 americans 
of whom 42653 have died since june 1 1981 according to the cdc 
no one is known to have recovered from aids 
the study coauthored by folks will be published friday in 
science the journal of the american association for the advancement 
of science 
other coauthors of the study are jan m orenstein elaine jaffe 
jesse s justement and anthony s fauci of the national institutes 
of health and steven w kessler of the the naval medical research 
institute

too badly burned 
people were seen running naked when the fire began everyone in 
the way was burned he said 
gajree said the cause of the fire had not been determined it 
could be a cigarette or anything else he said three loud 
explosions were heard but they could have been caused by flammable 
vapor 
the fire started at a naphtha tank and spread to two other tanks 
krs narayan director of the companys refinery division said 
the explosion may have occurred in a dispatch unit where trucks are 
loaded near the naphtha tanks 
but two truck drivers who saw the naphtha tanks explode said they 
thought the explosion originated closer to the tanks

a man who was on a hijacked twa 
jetliner said thursday the seizure of the plane appeared to have 
been wellplanned but that once the hijackers had the jet they were 
thrown into confusion 
thomas murry an employee of a us aviation company was the 
second american witnesses to testify thursday at the trial of 
mohammed ali hamadi who admitted taken part in the june 1985 
hijacking 
the whole thing hijacking was like a theatrical performance 
a wellrehearsed play in which something had gone wrong they could 
not follow the preferred script murry said 
murry 61 said watching the hijackers running up and down the 
aisle of the airplane was as if they werent prepared for an 
aircraft with a door at the back 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem is charged with murder and air 
piracy in the hijacking of twa flight 847 us navy diver robert 
stethem was killed and 39 americans were held hostage for 17 days 
during the ordeal 
hamadi has has denied killing the 23yearold sailor 
earlier thursday another former hostage said he feared that 
someone on the airplane might attempt to overpower the terrorists 
and cause them to set off a hand grenade they were carrying 
i had a fear that someone would try to attack the hijackers and 
they would drop the grenade said robert trautmann a 40yearold 
real estate developer 
trautmann also spoke of the brutal beatings of passengers during 
the hijacking as have many witnesses since the trial began july 5 
i heard the beatings and screams in the front of the plane 
he told the court saying that at one point i feared i would be 
killed 
neither murry or trautmann said where he was from under 
guidelines set by the court to protect witnesses security at the 
time of the hijacking trautmann lived in laredo texas and murry in 
valencia calif 
hamadi often looked back to the spectator section where his 
parents ali hassan and fatima hamadi were sitting 
stethems parents richard and patricia stethem also attended 
the session as they have done regularly since the trial opened 
hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport on jan 13 1987 after 
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage

the us air force has been flying a 
stealth radarevading jet fighter for seven years and now has 
about 50 of the planes at an isolated base in nevada the pentagon 
acknowledged thursday 
partially lifting a veil of secrecy that has enveloped the plane 
from its birth the pentagon and air force released a photograph of 
the unusual aircraft but declined to discuss its capabilities the 
limited disclosures were made now because the air force needs to 
start flying the craft in daylight a spokesman said 
the pentagon said the plane had been declared operational and 
ready for wartime missions in october 1983 but that it first flew 
in june 1981 
the stealth fighter is officially known as the f117a said 
dan howard the pentagons chief spokesman 
it has been operational since october 1983 and is assigned to 
the 4450th tactical group at nellis air force base nev the 
aircraft is based at the tonopah test range airfield in nevada 
the photograph released by the pentagon depicts a relatively 
small sweptwing plane with a flat underbelly it somewhat 
resembles a sting ray black or dark blue with no exterior markings 
the cockpit is located far forward in a nose that comes to a 
sharp point with what appears to be gun barrels or airspeed probes 
sticking out 
the plane features a v tail atop a fuselage that ends in a 
rectangle apparently completely encompassing the two engines that 
power the plane the air intakes for the engines appear to be fitted 
tightly into the sides of the fuselage just below the cockpit 
the sweptback wings would suggest the plane is capable of flying 
at supersonic speeds but the air force declined to discuss the 
matter military sources have said the plane is designed for sneak 
ground attacks and not airtoair dogfighting 
the air force has ordered 59 of the planes and 52 of them have 
been delivered howard said three of the planes have crashed and 
two pilots have been killed the air force added 
to protect its secrecy the plane has been flown only at night 
but the air force needs to start flying the plane during daylight if 
it is to integrate the squadrons war plans with other units howard 
said 
howard and air force officials declined to discuss how much the 
program cost neither would they offer information on the planes 
dimensions or general capabilities the materials from which it was 
constructed or the major subcontractors involved 
the plane is built by the lockheed corp at a tightly guarded 
plant in burbank calif the air force said 
the very first production model of the plane crashed with a 
lockheed corp pilot at the controls the air force said that test 
pilot survived the accident for which no date was given 
the second crash occurred on july 11 1986 near bakersfield 
calif and the third on oct 14 1987 at nellis air force base 
the service said both pilots were killed 
the stealth fighter is a mature system which has enjoyed 
bipartisan congressional support since its inception and can now 
be fully integrated into operational plans in support of worldwide 
defense commitments howard said 
the spokesman denied the administration was trying to bolster 
support for republican defense policies by unveiling the plane 
in order to move the system further along they have to start 
daytime flying howard said thats what driving it and i think 
both sides of the aisle on the hill understand that 
according to military sources the planes are kept at a high 
state of readiness for use as aerial shock troops capable of 
slipping behind enemy lines without being detected on radar and 
creating confusion with unexpected bombing runs 
the sources said the decision to unveil the plane was prompted in 
part by the scheduled nov 22 unveiling of the b2 stealth bomber 
the bomber has been built with more recent and advanced technology 
than the fighter so there is little reason to continue to hide the 
fighter the sources explained 
pentagon officials also had glumly concluded that even if they 
wanted to keep the program secret upcoming court fights were likely 
to shatter security the sources continued 
production line workers at the lockheed plant in burbank have 
gone to court with charges they are being sickened by exposure to 
dangerous chemicals

china acknowledged thursday it has only begun to 
count casualties and damage from the earthquake that devastated its 
southern border region and it said the death toll now at 938 is 
expected to rise 
the official count of those seriously injured rose to more than 
2870 with no count being kept of those with minor injuries a 
leading seismologist estimated more than 1000 were dead and 
predicted another strong quake will soon hit the same area along the 
burmese border 
an earthquake measuring 53 on the richter scale shook the 
southeastern chinese provinces of guangxi zhuang and guangdong on 
thursday but the state seismology bureau said it was centered 
offshore in the beibu gulf and no damage was reported 
seismologists said it may have been an aftershock to the sunday 
quake that devastated dozens of remote towns and farming villages in 
yunnan province west of guangxi zhuang that quake measured 76 on 
the richter scale 
both the number of injured and the death toll are expected to 
rise as rescue workers reach isolated villages and unearth more 
bodies the official xinhua news agency said 
xinhua issued half a dozen reports on the quake thursday 
acknowledging for the first time the scope of the disaster after 
days of near silence 
it said the quake had almost totally destroyed a 
13squaremile area a much larger area suffered lesser damage 
in the worsthit village zhanmapo xinhua said doctors had set 
up a makeshift openair hospital because tents had not yet arrived 
all 287 dead in the village were buried it said 
so far no infectious diseases have occurred it quoted zhan 
fubao head of the local epidemic prevention station as saying 
xinhua said 707 bodies were recovered in the quake zone still 
far below the figure of 938 dead that government officials told un 
aid agencies the officials also said more than 100000 people were 
homeless 
chen yong deputy director of the state seismology bureau told 
xinhua he estimated more than 1000 were dead 
most of the buildings in the area were built of bamboo and 
wood and over 80 percent of them have collapsed he said 
chen said about 190 aftershocks have hit the same area and 
predicted that one measuring about 60 on the richter scale will hit 
soon 
strong aftershocks will probably last about two months or even 
longer he said 
the richter scale is a gauge of the strength of an earthquake as 
measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph a quake of 
60 is capable of causing considerable damage each increase of one 
digit on the scale indicates a tenfold increase in strength 
song jian a member of the ruling communist partys policymaking 
central committee and of the state council chinas cabinet arrived 
at the quake epicenter thursday afternoon to inspect damage 
xinhua said he praised rescue workers for their roundtheclock 
efforts and promised the party will help quake victims rebuild their 
homes 
two thousand soldiers have been working without sleep or rest 
digging victims from the wreckage of collapsed buildings giving 
emergency firstaid to the injured repairing highways building 
temporary shelters and delivering food to the survivors xinhua 
said 
more than 75 tons of medicine and 24 tons of food have been sent 
into the quake area by helicopter truck and horsedrawn cart the 
news agency said fuel and building materials also have been brought 
in 
the government told the united nations development program and 
world food program on wednesday that it would welcome outside aid

an elementary school principal arrested for 
allegedly buying two vials of crack was vilified thursday by parents 
demanding his removal and defended by shocked coworkers as he 
awaited arraignment on drug charges 
matthew barnwell 55 the first city principal ever arrested on 
drug charges remained on the board of education payroll following 
his arrest wednesday one week after schools chancellor richard 
green announced a drug crackdown in schools 
this is a terribly shocking incident its distressing said 
ted ellsworth head of the 4600member council of supervisors and 
administrators ellsworth said the arrest for criminal possession of 
a controlled substance was the first drug arrest among his 
membership 
the bust on a harlem streetcorner near barnwells home sparked 
angry comments from parents with children attending ps 53 in the 
morrisania section of the bronx while coworkers came to barnwells 
defense 
parents and school officials charged barnwell was frequently late 
or absent from school he had been suspended for 10 days in 1975 
i dont like everyone talking against my principal said 
elizabeth galloway a school aide at the elementary school which 
has 1300 pupils if something is wrong he should be given an 
opportunity to get himself well 
agreed school administrator robert hannibal this is getting 
blown out of proportion 
but elizabeth mack who has two girls in the fourth grade at the 
school demanded barnwells removal 
he should have never had the job in the first place said ms 
mack standing outside the school with her daughters he was 
endangering our kids lives im glad hes not here now 
desiree deloach refused to let her 5yearold daughter shamieka 
inside the school building thursday i was very angry i came here 
this morning and made a lot of noise she said 
ellsworth however called barnwells arrest an isolated incident 
which shouldnt reflect poorly on the rest of the citys school 
employees 
while this is terribly disturbing we have thousands of workers 
fighting to keep drugs out of the schools and get rid of the 
problem said ellsworth it is not my sense that drugtesting is 
needed 
barnwells record as principal of the school was troubled during 
his 16year tenure school officials said in 1975 he was suspended 
for 10 days after covering up for an assistant principal accused of 
using corporal punishment 
jerome greene a member of the local school board said barnwell 
had been taken off the job and temporarily reassigned three other 
times recently for his regular lateness his absence and his 
general demeanor 
once barnwell is arraigned and released he will be reassigned to 
the local district office with pay pending completion of legal 
action said board of education spokesman frank sobrino

streets of the capital thursday and demanded that president hussain 
muhammad ershad resign to pave the way for parliamentary elections 
the demonstrators shouting antigovernment slogans met in five 
separate rallies to mark the anniversary of a violent campaign 
launched on nov 10 1987 to topple ershad 
but political observers say they believe lack of unity among the 
opposition groups make the removal of the president improbable 
among the organizers of thursdays rallies were sheik hasina 
leader of the awami league khaleda zia head of the bangladesh 
nationalist party other leftist parties and the moslem 
fundamentalist jamaateislami 
ershad 59 seized power in a march 1982 coup and imposed 
military law which was lifted in november 1986 in favor of a 
civilian government 
his jatiya party won a parliamentary majority in disputed march 3 
elections that were boycotted by the 20 major opposition parties 
including those led by mrs zia and sheik hasina that have no vote 
in parliament 
parliament earlier this year passed a law making islam the 
official religion of this 85 percent moslem nation drawing strong 
protests from opposition politicians women students and 
representative of christian hindu and buddhist minorities 
mrs zia told a noontime rally of about 5000 cheering supporters 
in the citys main square that the 300seat parliament must be 
dissolved in favor of a caretaker government that would organize new 
elections 
sheik hasina daughter of slain president sheik mujibur rahman 
who led bangladesh after it won independence from pakistan in 1971 
told a rally of about 10000 supporters we want true democracy 
and a genuine representative government our campaign against the 
autocratic rule of ershad is continuing 
last year supporters of mrs zia and hasina joined forces to 
stage violent street protests and general strikes but the two 
groups have since drifted apart 
we do not want any unity with those who have secret deals with 
the military and the government hasina said referring to mrs 
zia whom she has accused of having links with the army 
mrs zias husband ziaur rahman came to power in a 
militarycivilian uprising that toppled the government of mujibur 
rahman sheik hasinas father on nov 7 1975 ziaur rahman was 
killed in an aborted military coup in may 1981 
the opposition is observing the anniversary of their 
failure shah moazzem hossain secretary general of governing 
jatiya party told a rally near dhaka on wednesday 
ershad is to travel to the united states for a special session of 
the un general assembly on nov 16 in which he is expected to 
speak about the flooding in bangaldesh that killed more than 1500 
people and left 40 million homeless

asne expressed profound dismay over the restrictions imposed 
oct 20 on the two british radio and tv networks saying the ban is

a man charged with sexually assaulting his 
young daughter was acquitted thursday nearly 1 years after his 
estranged wife chose jail rather than let him see the child 
after the rockingham county superior court jury issued its 
verdict mark russell murabito 33 of derry said he will seek 
custody of the girl now 5 and her 4yearold brother 
shes just a little girl and like other people who got 
involved with my wife she got used murabito said 
the jury began deliberating late wednesday resumed thursday 
morning and returned the verdict just before noon 
county attorney carleton eldredge who brought the charge against 
murabito in march said he was disappointed with the verdict 
murabitos now exwife jesse murabito 40 of belmont was led 
from the courtroom by supporters with her head down and left through 
the back of the courthouse to avoid reporters 
a spokeswoman from nashua rape and assault support services 
which has supported mrs murabito since 1986 said the woman is in 
a state of shock 
as far as the criminal justice system goes on this case its 
over said deborah fauth the agencys program director we 
tried to make the system work we have a strong belief in the 
system were just disappointed at the outcome 
in february 1987 mrs murabito went to jail after disobeying a 
court order to disclose the childrens whereabouts after a week 
she was released when she permitted murabito supervised visitation 
rights 
in a divorce hearing in march 1987 a judge ruled there was 
insufficient evidence to back her claims and gave murabito 
unsupervised visitation 
a grand jury a year later indicted murabito on a charge that he 
sexually assaulted the child after he was given unsupervised 
visitation rights 
during the trial defense lawyers contended mrs murabito hoped 
to make up to 15 million on book and movie rights to her story 
she denied the charge 
they also said she influenced the daughter through repeated 
interrogations to describe the alleged abuse 
the prosecutions first witness was the child the courtroom was 
closed and requests to get a transcript of her testimony were 
rejected 
a doctor testified that during a september 1987 examination of 
the girl he found internal scar tissue he judged to be a sexual 
injury he could not say how or when the injury was inflicted but 
doubted the girl caused the injury herself

george bushs election as president 
has left this chic seaside resort pleased and proud but also 
concerned over a tourist invasion if it becomes the site of the next 
summer white house 
i think everyones real excited kathy anuszewski said as she 
worked at the lobster port a shop bush frequents about a mile from 
his family compound but no one really knows what to expect about 
its effect on the town 
bush has spent every summer since he was a child except when he 
was serving as a pilot during world war ii in this seaside 
community of 4500 he and his wife barbara own a ninebedroom home 
on rockbound walkers point a peninsula that juts into the atlantic 
local residents speak of bush and his family with reverence even 
those worried about the potential consequences of the secret 
service a white house staff journalists and tourists converging on 
the town admit that having the president of the united states living 
nearby is an honor 
i am proud im pleased hell be here said gerda towne who 
owns two stores in the upscale town where shopping and sailing are 
prime activities 
but towne also expressed concern that kennebunkport where 
jewelry brass and maritimerelated items sell at a premium might 
soon be invaded by tshirt and postcard shops in fact since bush 
was elected vice president a few tshirt shops have already opened 
the merchants have got to be sure the town doesnt go to pot 
we dont want any honkytonks towne declared 
janet winters a member of the towns board of selectmen said 
there is also concern about the effect of tourist traffic on the 
town already the narrow twolane streets are clogged daily between 
may and september 
ocean avenue the winding thin road where the bush family lives 
is often lined with cars bearing people who sit and stare by the 
hour at the bush estate many locals say they fear those crowds will 
grow 
im a little leery because i dont know what costs the town 
will incur winters said every bus tour that comes into 
southern maine will swing into town 
but still she added theres a sense of pride in him a 
feeling its our town that could be the center of attention 
earlier this year bush said he would forego kennebunkport as his

mayor william h hudnut iii and marion county 
prosecutor stephen goldsmith have expressed interest in the senate 
seat dan quayle will vacate next year a local republican party 
official said thursday 
county republican chairman john w sweezy said the vacancy came 
up during discussions with hudnut and goldsmith about the future of 
the state party after quayle becomes vice president 
hudnut took along his longtime political aide bruce b melchert 
when he met with sweezy the mayor declined to comment on the 
meeting 
the discussion was about politics im sure it the senate 
vacancy came up in discussion said david arland hudnuts media 
aide he the mayor did not say they talked about it but you and 
i know he probably did 
its an item for discussion arland said 
goldsmith confirmed he discussed the position with sweezy 
i just expressed my interest to my county chairman which is 
what i was told is the traditional way to do these things im 
obviously interested but im really not an active candidate because 
you cant campaign for it goldsmith said 
sweezy said he has not been asked by gov robert d orr to 
shake the bushes to see who may be interested in the vacancy 
i would imagine that anyone interested would go to the governor 
and present his case why he should be chosen he added 
orr has said he will wait until quayle resigns his senate seat to 
select a successor who can function effectively 
it needs to be somebody also man or woman who has the 
capacity to campaign statewide twice in the period of three years 
he said thats an unbelievable undertaking campaigning let 
alone raising the money to be successful 
quayle won reelection in 1986 and his successor would serve 
until 1990 when a special election would be held to determine who 
would complete the remaining two years of his term 
published reports and speculation by political insiders have 
named other possible candidates as rep dan coats unsuccessful gop 
gubernatorial candidate john mutz and state rep paul mannweiler 
who is speaker of the indiana house

vandals painted swastikas and antisemitic slurs at a jewish 
cemetery in rhode island and in the office of a jewish student 
organization in new york one day after a ceremony marking the 50th 
anniversary of kristallnacht 
i cant even find the word for it its so hurtful james 
oppenheim president of the jewish student union at the state 
university of new york at binghamton ny said thursday 
there was no sign of forced entry at the office and sanctuary in 
the basement of the student union oppenheim said the group has 
about 200 students that coordinate activities on the campus which 
has about 5000 jewish students 
i think its politically motivated because they didnt do any 
damage that we can see oppenheim said 
police were taking fingerprints in the rooms but had no suspects 
said raymond dye vice president of student affairs 
on wednesday night the jewish group sponsored a candlelight vigil 
to commemorate the 50th anniversary of kristallnacht the night the 
nazis began their first organized assaults against the jews in 
germany and austria 
in woonsocket ri vandals painted swastikas and antisemitic 
slogans at a 95yearold jewish cemetery but police were uncertain 
whether the attack was related to kristallnacht observances 
a woman visiting bnai israel cemetery tuesday found her sons 
headstone among the approximately halfdozen covered with swastikas 
and other nazi symbols the main road to the cemetery also had been 
inscribed with antijewish slogans and the german word for jew 
juden 
today when i went to the cemetery it was a very terrible 
reminder of things that have happened to us in the past temple 
bnai israel president edith wittes told those assembled for a 
kristallnacht memorial service 
in addition to the nazi symbols there were other images with 
possible links to satanic worship such as skulls and an inverted 
cross with its arms turned down 
the sickness that made adolf hitler possible is alive and well 
today in our own community said rabbi joel chernikoff

world war ii navy hero who is chiefly remembered for his role in the 
watergate scandal will be buried in arlington national cemetery 
with full military honors

mitchell a very private man will be public but the burial will be 
in the presence only of relatives and close friends 
the office of richard m nixon did not know whether the former 
president would attend the service mitchell was nixons friend law 
partner and campaign manager in the successful 1968 and 1972 
presidential campaigns 
the 75yearold mitchell died after suffering a heart attack 
wednesday near his home in the georgetown section of washington 
robert mardian an assistant attorney general under mitchell and 
a codefendant at the watergate coverup trial called him one of 
the most brilliant men ive ever known 
he had a dry sense of humor very considerate a very kind 
man mardian said 
mardian was one of five men tried for conspiring to cover up 
white house involvement in the burglary of democratic national 
headquarters in the watergate office building the burglars were 
agents of the committee to reelect the president which mitchell 
headed 
one of the five lawyer kenneth parkinson was acquitted and 
mardians conviction was overturned on appeal mitchell served 19 
months in a federal prison although five of them were spent outside 
on medical furloughs former nixon chief of staff hr haldeman and 
domestic counselor john d ehrlichman each seved 18 months 
ehrlichman who lives in santa fe nm and haldeman in santa 
barbara calif declined thursday to comment on mitchells death 
but abbie hoffman one of the chicago seven defendants prosecuted 
by mitchells justice department in connection with the riots during 
the 1968 democratic national convention said wherever hes 
going i hope he has a good lawyer 
richard kleindienst who succeeded mitchell as attorney general 
characterized him as a fine man who got caught up in a bizarre 
situation protected his president and went to jail for it 
henry kissinger national security adviser and secretary of state 
in the nixon administration praised mitchell for his loyalty to 
nixon the watergate thing i just had no firsthand chance to

in which john f kennedy served as a lieutenant he was awarded two 
purple hearts for combat wounds and also won the silver star one of 
the navys highest decorations 
mitchell began his relationship with nixon when their two law 
firms merged in 1967 and although a year younger became nixons 
mentor they remained friends even though nixon once suggested in a 
taped white house conversation that mitchell take the whole rap for 
the watergate coverup 
as attorney general mitchell loosened wiretap restrictions and 
submitted an anticrime package to congress that included pretrial 
detention of those considered likely to commit further crimes if 
freed on bail 
he was considered the force behind a bill that would have 
permitted the 1965 voting rights act to expire 
mitchell was born in detroit on sept 15 1913 he was reared on 
long island ny and attended fordham university in new york 
because it had an accelerated law school he specialized in bond law

conservative republican rep connie mack iii won a 
cliffhanger senate race thursday over rep kenneth buddy mackay 
a moderate democrat for the seat being relinquished by democratic 
sen lawton chiles 
macks narrow victory based on absentee ballots still being 
counted decided the last of this years 33 senate races it means 
the democrats will have a 5545 majority a gain of one seat in the 
new us senate 
but while mack claimed victory mackay did not immediately 
concede and his campaign manager said there might be a legal 
challenge because of what he called irregularities in some vote 
totals 
i think at this point the numbers are conclusive mack told 
the associated press by telephone its very exciting 
i dont know the exact word to use theres been a great 
deal of anxiety its been long its been tough but i felt all 
along that my message of more freedom free markets freedom from 
taxes freedom as an objective of our foreign policy would come 
through clearly said mack 48yearold grandson of the baseball 
hall of fame manager 
the aps latest tally showed mack with 2044575 votes or 50 
percent to mackays 2014924 votes also 50 percent that gave 
mack a margin of nearly 30000 votes more than enough to avoid the 
automatic recount that would be triggered if the difference was less 
than about 20000 about 5000 absentee votes still were out in bay 
county a mack stronghold in the panhandle 
campaign manager greg farmer said mackay who remained at his 
home in ocalas historic district planned a conference call with 
legal counsel to discuss taking the election to court as farmer 
recommended 
we may have to ask the fat lady for an encore farmer said 
somethings screwy with those numbers 
farmer said that the way races were listed on the ballots may 
have confused voters in some counties he cited three counties where 
more votes were cast for president than senate hillsborough county 
where the difference was nearly 60000 palm beach where it was 
nearly 52000 and dade nearly 49000 
mike dukakis got more votes in palm beach than buddy mackay 
cmon now farmer said by telephone 
mackay 55 was doing some gardening and also had told his staff 
he would be praying and reading poetry until the results were known 
he told staffers he had taken a risk as is sometimes necessary in 
life and fallen short while his political career might be ending 
mackay said he would remain in public service 
as 39 million votes filtered in election night exit polls were 
enough for the three major television networks to declare mackay the 
winner 
but mack moved ahead wednesday as partial results from 134000 
absentee ballots came in the absentee ballots have traditionally 
favored republicans in florida and the gop earlier this year had a 
special drive to register supporters likely to vote by absentee 
ballot 
mack a former bank president and mackay a lawyer whos been 
one of floridas mostpraised politicians for two decades both were 
elected to the congress in 1982 mackay during 12 years in the 
florida legislature seven times was honored as the most valuable 
legislator and he dominated newspaper endorsements this year in 
his senate primary and the general election

the administration should enforce a provision 
in the new trade law that allows it to restrict imports from a 
country which refuses to grant organizing rights to workers an 
official of the aflcio said thursday 
in thailand they shoot people who want to organize labor 
said henry schecter the aflcios deputy director of economics in 
a speech to the national economists club 
he apparently was referring to the shooting in 1987 of a 
provincial union official yod plaeksawat no link to an employer 
has been proved in that case but there have been many instances of 
intimidation of labor organizers in thailand including threats to 
life according to the asianamerican free labor institute an 
aflcio affiliate 
at the thai embassy counselor pradap pibulsongram said the 
thai government recognizes worker rights of course there are abuses 
in any country but our government does not condone them 
schecter said that enforcing the labor rights provision of the 
trade law doesnt mean that we have to stop imports it does mean 
you have to allow the same rights of organization and bargaining 
that we have had 
before passage of the new law denial of labor rights had already 
been the ground for denying some countries including paraguay 
chile romania and nicaragua the right to ship some goods to the 
united states without payment of duty 
hearings have been scheduled for next week on adding others to 
the list 
under the new law the president can designate an offending 
country as engaging in an unfair labor practice and take further 
action against its trade the law also sets the goal of obtaining an 
international agreement on labor rights

the state supreme court on thursday 
temporarily blocked deep cuts in auto insurance rates mandated by 
voters but the measures author said insurance companies cant 
thwart the will of the people 
legislative leaders might ask gov george deukmejian to call a 
special emergency session to deal with the uproar over the 
rateslashing measure said bob forsyth a spokesman for senate 
president pro tem david roberti 
the voters have spoken and they expect the state legislature to 
implement proposition 103 the leaders said in a draft of a letter 
to the governor 
proposition 103 forces insurance companies to reduce rates for 
most liability policies including those for cars homes and 
businesses 20 percent below november 1987 rates the rollback would 
be effective when current policies are renewed 
the measure backed by consumer advocate ralph nader reduces 
premiums by an additional 20 percent for motorists with clean 
driving records and freezes premiums at those lower rates for at 
least two years 
california voters narrowly approved the initiative tuesday while 
rejecting four other insurance measures sponsored by insurers and 
trial lawyers 
in response to three insurance company lawsuits claiming the 
measure is unconstitutional the high court issued an order signed 
by six of seven justices staying proposition 103 indefinitely to 
allow time for consideration of the measure 
nearly 50 insurance companies responded to the voter revolt 
against skyrocketing rates by announcing they would stop writing 
certain policies in california 
at least six other insurance companies including aetna life amp 
casualty and firemans fund insurance cos said they have withdrawn 
or intend to withdraw from the auto insurance business in california 
were finding exactly what we feared and that is theres no 
marketplace left as a result of the passage of proposition 103 
said don stewart executive director of the pasadenabased american 
agents alliance a 600member association of independent insurance 
brokers and agents 
the rate rollbacks that are contained in 103 will require 
insurance companies to sell their products at a loss said george 
tye spokesman for the association of california insurance companies 
for any business that kind of situation creates total havoc 
thats one of the points on which were challenging the 
constitutionality of proposition 103 tye said 
but proposition 103 author harvey rosenfield said its clear 
that insurance companies are now trying to shift the battle to the 
courts to thwart the will of the people when they lost the battle 
in the election 
last week the same insurance companies were claiming the 
courts were at fault for high insurance rates our feeling is that 
the courts should look at this thing very carefully we intend to 
intervene on behalf of all the voters i doubt very much if the 
courts are going to overturn the will of the people rosenfield 
said 
sen alan robbins a democrat who chairs the state senate 
insurance committee agreed that the rate rollbacks must go into 
effect 
the bottom line is the insurance companies are going to have to 
learn to live with the rate cut sooner or later this legal 
challenge just postpones the inevitable robbins said 
proposition 103 was approved despite the insurance industrys 60 
million campaign seeking its defeat and passage of its own measures 
it was the nations most costly state political campaign ever 
state department of insurance officials said consumers need not 
panic about whether they will be able to renew policies or obtain 
new ones 
its premature to say what is going to happen because there are 
650 or 700 firms writing propertycasualty business in california 
said insurance commissioner roxani gillespie who is appointed by 
the governor 
californias insurance market is the nations largest its auto 
insurance rates are the nations third highest on average after new 
jersey and alaska insurers blame the rates on huge damage awards in 
court cases and the states high medical costs

the environmental protection agency said 
thursday its sampling of the indoor air in 10 public buildings 
around the country turned up traces of more than 500 different 
chemicals 
though the concentrations were generally small sometimes they 
reached 100 times the levels found in typical outdoor air the 
agency said 
no one knows what the health effects are at those 
concentrations said chris rice the agencys spokesman on air 
pollution 
the agency released a report on its surveys of indoor air in 1983 
through 1987 in 10 buildings around the country together with a 
pamphlet of advice for homeowners on indoor air quality problems 
the pamphlet generally advises homeowners to try to get rid of 
the sources of air pollutants indoors such as stopping smoking to 
use judicious ventilation such as kitchen exhaust fans and not to 
keep unused products that might give off contaminants such as 
leftover paints and aerosols 
epa has published pamphlets on particular indoor polluants 
before such as radon gas but never on the general subject as a 
whole 
a new office building in research triangle park nc had the 
highest concentrations for most of the volatile compounds the 
report said however by the third trip most of the compounds had 
decreased considerably 
the office building air was checked just after the building was 
completed in 1983 one month later and five months later 
for example the median concentration of a common solvent 
111trichloroethane dropped from 290 micrograms per cubic meter 
of air just after completion to 40 micrograms five months later 
many of the volatile organics many originate from cleaning 
agents and pesticides the study suggested 
such chemicals have attracted increasing attention in recent 
years as a source of sick building syndrome responsible for 
flulike episodes among employees 
epa itself is the subject of a union complaint about chemicals 
given off by new carpets in a section of the agencys washington 
headquarters 
besides the north carolina office building the epa surveyed two 
homes for the elderly a public school and office building in 
washington dc a hospital and an associated nursing home in 
martinsburg wva an office building in fairfax va a nursing 
home in worcester mass and an officeandclassroom building at 
harvard university in cambridge mass

denied mustering out benefits and was granted disability status for 
only one tooth 
the legislation gives him 18000 for his mouth injury in

at a house judiciary subcommittee hearing and the bill was passed 
in the most recent congress

unisys corp pleaded guilty thursday to 
three counts of mischarging the army on a 92 million contract and 
agreed to pay 810600 in fines and other penalties 
the action presented for the first time thursday in us district 
court involved mischarges and misallocation of labor charges 
stemming from a fiveyear computer software contract between sperry 
corp a predecessor of unisys and the armys information systems 
command at fort huachuca in sierra vista ariz said assistant us 
attorney gary korn 
under the plea agreement unisys was assessed 250000 in 
criminal penalties 250000 in civil restitution 250000 in civil 
double damages 60000 as full payment for the governments 
investigative costs and 600 in special assessments 
the improper activities occurred at sperrys technical services 
division office in sierra vista the government and unisys said 
korn said the local manager directed employees to charge the army 
for work done under one delivery order to a subsequent order 
when the company reached the spending ceiling on a given order 
it should have stopped work or asked the army whether to stop or 
finish and for additional money korn said 
they never did that korn said saying the motive was the 
need to avoid exceeding estimated costs to keep getting the contract 
renewed annually 
andrew d hendry unisys vice president and general counsel 
pleaded guilty on the companys behalf to three felony falseclaims 
charges in which it misallocated labor charges totaling 250000 in 
1985 1986 and early 1987 
korn said the mischarging amounted to overcharging in the sense 
that they didnt ask for more money and went and spent it anyway 
the case was presented to us district judge richard bilby 
following a 1year investigation

house speaker jim wright and other democratic 
leaders said thursday they will back rep henry b gonzalez 
dtexas for the chairmanship of the house banking committee 
the endorsement all but guarantees that the 72yearold gonzalez 
a 27year veteran of congress from san antonio will take over the 
committee at a critical time during the debate over a taxpayer 
bailout of the fund that insures the nations savings institutions 
the current chairman rep fernand j st germain dri lost 
his reelection bid tuesday after his opponent made a campaign issue 
out of justice department allegations that st germain accepted 
thousands of dollars in entertainment from savings industry 
lobbyists 
wright at a news conference said democratic leaders met 
thursday afternoon and unanimously decided to support gonzalez as st 
germains replacement when the house democratic caucus meets on dec 
6 
the united position of the democratic leadership is that henry 
b gonzalez deserves that opportunity is wellqualified and will be 
a fine chairman said wright a fellow texan 
others at the leadership meeting were house majority leader 
thomas s foley of washington majority whip tony coelho of 
california deputy whip david e bonior of michigan beryl anthony 
jr of arkansas chairman of the democratic congressional campaign 
committee budget committee chairman william gray of pennsylvania 
and democratic caucus secretary mary rose oakar of ohio 
ms oakar is also a member of the banking committee and had been 
mentioned as a possible alternative to gonzalez 
some members of the banking committee have been reluctant to 
support gonzalez who has a reputation as a maverick and has been 
more involved in housing issues than in mainstream banking issues 
also they favored a chairman representing a home district with a 
less direct interest in the resolution of the savings and loan 
crisis the industrys worst losses are concentrated in texas and 
gonzalez has said he favors an immediate 50 billion expenditure 
from the treasury as the most effective and least costly solution in 
the long run 
other democrats on the banking committee expressing an interest 
in the job were reps frank annunzio of illinois john la falce of 
new york and stephen neal of north carolina rep doug barnard of 
georgia also was mentioned as a possibility 
however annunzio and neal said they would only accept the 
position if gonzalez didnt get it and aides for the others said 
they were unlikely to buck the leadership 
the other big question facing the committee next year will be the 
proposed relaxation of barriers between the banking and securities 
industries gonzalez has approached the issue cautiously expressing 
skepticism about deregulating too quickly

iranian diplomat here during the breakdown in ties hinted that the 
thaw between the two nations could speed the release of three 
british hostages in lebanon 
speaking in a radio interview with the british broadcasting 
corp basti said the hostage issue had not come up in negotiations 
but he added if you are trying to imply that the new relationship 
between iran and britain may contribute to that end im not going 
to deny that 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie whose envoy terry waite 
disappeared in lebanon in january 1987 while trying to negotiate 
freedom for two american hostages said 
certainly this cannot do any harm we must wait and see this 
is welcome news after all the purpose of this diplomacy is to make 
it easy for governments to talk to each other 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe told the bbc there was no 
bargain or secret agenda but he said the thaw in relations 
enabled britain more effectively to press the case at every 
opportunity for the iranians to use all the influence they have got 
to secure the release of hostages 
whether that will produce an improvement in the position of the 
hostages i cannot say howe said i dont want to raise false 
hopes 
in june 1987 britain withdrew its diplomats from tehran closed 
irans consulate in manchester and cut its london embassy staff to

persian gulf prompted britain to close the london office from which 
iran was running a worldwide armspurchasing operation for its war 
against iraq 
a foreign office statement thursday said iran and britain had 
decided to resume full diplomatic representation with immediate 
effect based on reciprocity mutual respect and noninterference in 
each others affairs 
a diplomatic source in london speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the agreement allowed for up to 16 diplomats in each 
country to assume posts over the next several months 
he said an application had been made to iranian authorities for a 
visa for gordon pirie a 51yearold diplomat who would become 
britains temporary charge daffaires 
howe said britain would have a charge daffaires in iran within a 
few weeks and an exchange of ambassadors within hopefully six 
months of that

soldiers opened fire killing at least 15 a military spokesman said 
thirty people were injured including three soldiers said the 
spokesman who cannot be identified under briefing rules he said 
the injured soldiers were hit by rocks and bottles 
soldiers and armored cars stood guard in colombo the capital as 
three sinhalese politicians declared their candidacies for president 
of this island off southern india which has been plagued by five 
years of ethnic civil war 
more than 8500 people have been killed in a tamil insurrection 
that began in 1983 and extremist antigovernment have sprung up 
among the majority sinhalese 
militants in the tamil minority a predominantly hindu ethnic 
group making up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people are 
fighting for a separate homeland because of alleged discrimination 
in jobs and education 
sinhalese control the government military and judiciary most 
sinhalese are buddhists and they constitute 75 percent of the 
population 
no demonstrations were reported in colombo where troops 
patrolled the streets 
but demonstrators in three southern districts defied 
aroundtheclock curfews and marched through the streets demanding 
president junius r jayewardene and his government step down before 
the dec 19 presidential elections 
jayewardene is not running for reelection but sinhalese 
extremists claim his government is incapable of conducting fair 
elections 
the military spokesman said at least five people were killed in 
each of the three districts tangalle a coastal town 100 miles 
southeast of colombo tissmaharama near the coast 40 miles 
northeast of tangalle and monaragala an inland town 40 miles north 
of tissmaharama

the justice department has declined to seek 
civil fines from rep fernand j st germain dri for filing 
allegedly faulty financial disclosure reports a spokesman said 
thursday 
st germain chairman of the house banking committee was soundly 
defeated tuesday in his bid for a 15th term in congress in a race 
that political observers said was affected by continuing controversy 
over his ethics 
justice spokeswoman amy brown said that after a fivemonth review 
by the departments civil division the determination has been 
made not to bring a lawsuit under the civil penalty provisions of 
the financial disclosure requirements of the ethics in government 
act 
she declined to specify why the division reached that decision 
the civil divisions review of the case not previously disclosed 
to the public began late last may just after the departments 
criminal division announced that it would not bring criminal charges 
against st germain for allegedly failing to disclose that he had 
accepted meals and entertainment from savings and loan industry 
lobbyists 
the ethics in government act imposes a 5000 civil fine on 
anyone who knowingly and willfully falsifies or fails to file 
required financial disclosure forms the justice department has 
brought four such civil suits in the past it has filed only one 
criminal case resulting in the conviction of former rep george 
hansen of idaho under the disclosure provisions of the act 
the civil division routinely considers whether to file a civil 
suit after disclosure cases have been reviewed by the criminal 
division 
ms brown said the civil division had reviewed the reporting 
practices of other house and senate committee chairmen as part of 
its consideration of the st germain case 
she said steven kaufman a summer law clerk in the civil 
divisions federal programs branch had been assigned to conduct a 
sampling of hill disclosure forms to determine what the practices 
were in terms of reporting 
she said kaufman pulled copies last july of at least 100 forms 
including all senate and house committee chairmen for each year back 
through 1984 and some subcommittee chairmen 
kaufmans search has been erroneously attributed to the fbi in 
some published reports 
st germain the first house committee chairman to be defeated at 
the polls since oregon voters turned out ways and means committee 
chairman al ullman in 1960 was defeated by ron machtley a 
40yearold lawyer from newport and political neophyte 
eight days before the election a federal court here unsealed 
portions of a letter sent on may 31 by john c keeney acting 
justice criminal division chief to the house ethics committee 
keeneys letter referred for commitee review evidence gathered by 
the department and said substantial evidence of serious and 
sustained misconduct on the part of st germain had been found 
during the justice probe 
the day after the election st germain was hospitalized at 
newport hospital in rhode island with a skin infection on his leg 
hospital spokeswoman sandra king said thursday the congressmans 
release would depend on his response to medication and the outcome 
of certain tests

house speaker jim wright said thursday hes not 
sure what presidentelect george bush means by his flexible 
freeze idea to cut the federal budget deficit but he will keep an 
open mind when bush comes to congress with details of the proposal 
bush advanced the flexible freeze concept during the presidential 
election campaign as an answer to how the nation can meet its 
financial obligations while cutting the tide of red ink he said he 
would limit spending on all programs except social security to 4 
percent or the rate of inflation 
the concept drew reactions ranging from ridicule to curiosity in 
congress which will have to find a way of saving about 32 billion 
next year to meet the target specified by the grammrudman 
deficitreduction act 
im not sure i understand exactly what those two words 
define wright said when asked about the flexible freeze concept 
he said if bush means that total federal spending growth will be 
limited to the amount of inflation and that budget pie then will be 
divided according to an agreement reached by congress and the 
administration then that is one part of a solution 
it isnt a total solution because obviously the amount we have 
been spending in the past has exceeded the amount the government 
takes in revenue he added that alone wouldnt lead to a balanced 
budget he said 
i have an open mind and im willing to listen to the 
presidents refinement of exactly how he interprets the meaning of 
that phrase 
wright made his comments to reporters following a meeting at 
which the house democratic leadership began mapping strategy for the 
101st congress the congress convenes in january 
asked whether bush can achieve the necessary deficit reduction 
without breaking his read my lips pledge not to raise taxes 
wright said that is a difficult question i suppose he must have 
in his mind some proposal and i eagerly await it 
but he said bushs oftrepeated antitax pledge did not amount 
to a mandate from the voters i dont think the mandate is so 
strong for any of the specific things the presidentelect has said 
the first signal about whether bush is serious about attacking 
the deficit may well come from whom he appoints as his two members 
of the national economic commission a bipartisan group constituted 
last year to craft a politically palatable solution to the budget 
crisis 
bush criticized the commission during the campaign as a device to 
push a tax increase but wright said the two appointments to which 
bush is entitled will speak louder 
will they be pragmatic people will they be realistic people 
will they be people dedicated to finding a true solution to this 
enormous budget crisis wright said will they be people who 
want us to pay as we go i think that may be his first signal but 
well await that signal 
wright repeatedly refused to offer his own view on how to make 
the needed savings saying proposing a new budget will be bushs 
prerogative 
i owe it to him not to prejudge or preempt him but wait 
patiently for the program he will offer wright said 
wright said he hoped bush truly desires a gentler kinder 
climate of public discourse civil debate i shall not be the 
first to break that truce 
if there is a mandate in bushs election and the bolstering of 
democratic control of the congress wright said it is for both to 
continue and build upon the constructive program that we embarked 
upon last year and the year before

a federal administrative judge ruled thursday 
that stiff landing fees aimed at keeping smaller aircraft out of 
bostons logan airport violate federal aviation law because they are 
discriminatory and unfair 
a final decision on how to deal with the fee structure imposed 
last summer by the massachusetts port authority rests with the 
transportation department to whom administrative law judge burton 
s kolko made his recommendations 
the case has been seen within the aviation industry as a test 
over how much power the federal government intends to allow local 
officials and airport operators in dealing with air traffic 
congestion 
a dot spokesman said the department will decide by dec 17 
whether to uphold kolkos decision or come down with an alternative 
finding on the boston airport fees which have raised a storm of 
protests among private and business pilots and in the commuter 
airline industry 
kolko in his decision said the logan fees are lacking in 
economic justification not fair and reasonable and are 
unjustly discriminatory toward private aircraft and smaller 
commuter planes 
the judge said that massport officials acted in violation of 
federal aviation laws and he concluded that the transportation 
department has legal grounds on which to take preemptive action to 
have the fees revoked 
massport officials said that since the fee structure has been in 
place logan has handled more passengers with fewer delays 
it is unsettling then that all the benefits could be 
dismantled if dot accepts the recommendations issued today the 
company said 
the transportation department announced last summer that it 
planned to closely examine the socalled pace program enacted at 
logan to curtail the volume of air traffic in and out of the busy 
boston airport 
after loud protests from private pilots and some commuter 
airlines congress included in its dot appropriations legislation 
earlier this year a provision ordering the department to stop 
airport construction money for logan if it concludes the fees 
violate aviation law and are not rescinded 
massport approved the higher landing fees for small aircraft last 
march saying logans capacity is a finite resource which must be 
managed wisely and efficiently in order to keep people moving with a 
minimum of delay 
the airports operators said they wanted to use logans limited 
capacity for airliner traffic and not private aircraft maintaining 
that a large jetliner with up to 400 people aboard deserves a 
higher priority than a cessna with two people on board 
the new fee structure went into effect in july after a us 
district judge ruled that the fees were not discriminatory 
the higher fees have affected both private pilots and commuter 
airlines the government said some commuter services were 
discontinued to logan after the new fees went into effect but that 
most commuters just passed the higher costs on to air travelers 
while the conclusion thursday by kolko is little more than a 
recommendation to senior department officials on whether to take 
administrative action it was hailed by private pilot groups and 
other critics of the logan fees 
john baker president of the aircraft owners and pilots 
association called the law judges decision well reasoned and 
said it makes it clear once and for all this country has a 
national aviation system that must be regulated by appropriate 
federal authority 
jonathan howe head of the national business aircraft 
association said his group now looks forward to the final 
determination on the massport fees by deputy secretary mimi dawson 
next month 
the entire aviation community was gratified by kolkos 
findings said edward w stimpson president of the general aviation 
manufacturers association the trade group that represents builders 
of small aircraft

an explosion in an underground sewerage tunnel 
thursday killed three workers who fled when methane gas built up 
but then returned to check the gas level 
the deaths were the fourth fifth and sixth fatalities in four 
deadly accidents on the tunnel project the contractor in march was 
cited by the occupational safety and health administration for 
unsafe conditions including poor ventilation 
rescue crews were hampered by high levels of methane in the 
tunnel under construction 40 feet below ground and special 
equipment had to be brought in to remove the gas and pump fresh air 
into the search area said deputy fire chief norm luedke 
the bodies of two workers were found about 2 pm five hours 
after the explosion or explosions said pat freeman corporate 
safety director for project contractor sa healy co the third was 
found a short time later 
one of them was a real good friend of mine freeman said his 
voice quivering 
the company identified the victims as ron kohne of big sandy 
tenn a tunnel superintendent tony bell of sturgeon bay a shift 
foreman and rick sochacki of south holland ill a safety 
officer all were believed to be in their 30s or 40s 
after the explosion two rescue crews moved about 1200 feet into 
the tunnel but they turned back on detecting methane levels of 6 
percent said luedke who heads the departments tunnel rescue unit 
any reading above 4 percent is considered dangerous he said 
they returned when fresh air was pumped in and discovered the 
bodies 
the dead workers were trapped approximately 2000 feet into the 
tunnel said deputy fire chief orville peterson 
patrick doig project manager for sa healy said 10 men were in 
the tunnel when a monitoring device showed high levels of methane 
all of the men left the tunnel he said and then three men went 
back in to check gas levels that was when the explosion occurred 
he said 
the three had handheld methane detectors but it was not known 
immediately whether they had breathing equipment with them he added 
freeman said he believed the methane that caused the explosion 
was naturally occurring from decayed organic matter 
the collector sewer near the accident site had been evacuated 
repeatedly in the last week because of unsafe levels of methane 
said chuck kennedy a resident engineer with the sewerage district 
program 
sa healy of mccook ill which is building the sewer under 
contract with the milwaukee metropolitan sewerage district was 
cited march 17 by osha 
osha director gerald cunningham called the violation serious and 
the company was fined 620 for not providing adequate ventilation in 
part of a tunnel and for failing to ground electrical equipment 
three workers were killed in the tunnel prior to thursday giving 
milwaukee the worst fatality record in the nation per dollar spent 
on a deep tunnel project said joseph mckinney executive director 
of the national safe workplace institute in chicago 
one man was crushed to death in a conveyor system another was 
struck in the head by a falling rock and the third fell 156 feet 
from a cage to the bottom of a tunnel air shaft 
chicago has had 10 fatalities on its deep tunnel project and 
cleveland has had three kinney said but both projects are further 
along in contruction he noted 
milwaukee metropolitan sewerage district spokeswoman rosemary 
murphy said the tunnel construction is part of a 21 billion 
project that will expand sewage collection and treatment of waste

the makeup of next years congress remained in doubt thursday 
with three house races in new york florida and oregon still 
undecided democrats had the lead in two of the contests but 
recounts wont be finished until later this month 
regardless of the outcome democrats will keep a solid hold on 
the 435seat house with a definite 259 seats to the republicans 
certain 173 if the 21 split in the undecided house seats holds 
the democrats will have picked up four seats between the 100th 
congress that adjourned last month and the 101st session that begins 
in january 
while some 98 percent of the house incumbents seeking reelection 
were victorious all three of those trailing in the undecided 
contests were incumbents 
in serious trouble in floridas 4th congressional district was 
democratic rep bill chappell a 20year veteran of the house whose 
ties to the defense industry have come under scrutiny 
with absentee ballots tallied chappell finished 727 votes behind 
lawyer craig james the gop candidate for the district that 
stretches from jacksonville past daytona beach 
final unofficial results gave james 125394 votes to 124667 for 
chappell leaving his only hope a recount under florida law this 
is required if the margin of difference between the candidates is 
less than onehalf of 1 percent 
five of the six counties in the district began recounting ballots 
thursday afternoon and expected to finish thursday night but 
flagler county supervisor of elections etta peterson said the 
recount in her county would not begin until monday morning 
unless there is some kind of gross error i would expect it to 
remain the same and i expect to be the congressman said the 
47year james an attorney and real estate agent if the counters 
did their job im the winner 
chappell 66 has not commented on the race since late tuesday 
the congressman has been chairman of the powerful house defense 
appropriations subcommittee that oversees billions of dollars each 
year in defense spending 
although he has not been accused of any crimes or indicted 
published reports have linked him to a federal investigation into 
pentagon procurement practices armtec a small defense contractor 
he brought to palatka was raided by the fbi last summer as part of 
the federal investigation 
in new yorks westchester county democrat nita lowey making her 
first run for political office led twoterm republican rep joseph

lowey 51 who served as an assistant new york secretary of 
state declared victory tuesday night but dioguardi 48 refused to 
concede although he said it would be an uphill battle to 
overcome her lead 
he said he owed it to his supporters to get a full count and 
would allow a recount to go ahead until the numbers proved his loss 
beyond a doubt board of elections officials said the entire process 
could take two weeks 
the democrats also were ahead in oregon where challenger mike 
kopetski was separated from republican incumbent denny smith in the 
5th congressional district by 1304 votes 
with absentee ballots still to be counted in two counties

nasa put up 7 million conditionally to 
enable the sole supplier of a key material used in the space shuttle 
and some defense rockets to reopen a plant thursday officials said 
national aeronautics and space administration officials said the 
money will either get avtex fibers inc back on its feet or give the 
space agency the rights to an avtex rayon fiber needed in the space 
shuttle and other rockets 
if avtex can demonstrate by nov 18 that it will get enough other 
contracts to keep its front royal plant in business nasa will then 
take out an 11 million contract for enough of the fiber for 12 
shuttle launches said jr thompson director of the marshall space 
flight center in huntsville ala 
i dont look at it as a bailout because every time we give 
them something they give us something in return thompson said 
were not in the bailout business 
one week ago avtex abruptly shut down all production at its 
aging mill in front royal citing stiff foreign competition for its 
other products and environmental regulations that have led to 
numerous pollution problems 
the sudden announcement sent nasa and the department of defense 
scrambling to determine the impact on the shuttle and an array of 
military missiles that use avtexs carbonizable rayon fiber to form 
rocket nozzles avtex is the only company certified to produce the 
fiber 
aerospace contractors met last week in salt lake city with avtex 
to look for a solution nasa officials met monday with avtex 
officials at the philadelphia airport thompson said 
after nasa pays avtex the initial 7 million they transfer the 
rights to nasa as well as the cookbook to making this rayon fiber to 
our technical specifications thompson said 
before nasa will give the valley forge pabased avtex the 11 
million contract for 11 million pounds of the fiber avtex will 
have to show that it can find other contracts to make itself 
solvent thompson said 
they have to come up with others thompson said we are not 
doing the whole thing by any means 
by wednesday afternoon avtex chairman and chief executive 
officer john n gregg was confident enough that a deal would be 
reached that he told the front royal plants 1300 employees to 
report for work thursday gregg who has refused to return repeated 
phone calls from the associated press told winchester radio station 
winc on thursday that when he told workers to come back he had no 
deal in hand 
we took a risk that we were making progress and that things 
that had not been resolved would be resolved gregg said 
gregg said he cut the deal with nasa on wednesday night 
we signed a contract with them and we signed a contract for 
some medical specialty fibers and those enabled us to really put 
together a good business gregg said he would not provide the 
dollar amount for the contracts 
i think were in a very secure position probably the best 
position weve been in in a number of years gregg said 
thompson dismissed the suggestion that avtex had suddenly 
announced its closing complete with overstated information on how 
the shuttle would be affected with the intention of pressuring the 
government into funding a bailout 
my honest opinion is they felt like they were just strapped and 
felt like they were going to shut down thompson said 
such dependence of a single supplier is not uncommon in the 
aerospace industry said analyst mary e oneill of duff amp phelps 
its so specialized theres not a commercial market out there 
for rockets she said theres not perfect competition but 
theres not perfect competition in a lot of markets 
paul nisbet of prudential bache securities inc agreed 
weve got a lot of areas in the whole aerospace and military 
industries where there are a lot of potential problems if sources 
disappear from view nisbet said 
avtex employees returned to work thursday officials of the 
almalgamated clothing and textile workers union met with management 
and said the company promised business as usual 
asked about the mood of the rank and file james brinklow 
business agent of union local 371t said some of them are right 
happy and some are not 
some workers have already found other jobs and others said they 
wont return to the plant because of its history of workersafety 
and environmental violations

the foreign minister said thursday that 
norway may stop exporting heavy water used in producing nuclear 
weapons following reports that a shipment intended for west germany 
was diverted to india 
thorvald stoltenberg told parliament that it was the cabinets 
intention to ban the exports although the issue has not yet been 
handled and approved by the government 
norway refuses to sell the water to india which has tested 
nuclear devices because india has not signed the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty 
investigators said last week that the diverted shipment of 
norwegian heavy water arrived in india in 1982 around the same time 
as a supply of soviet heavy water which made it difficult to trace 
stoltenberg said the legal basis for banning future sales could 
be found in an export control bill passed last year the national 
ntb news agency reported he said he was discussing the issue with 
trade minister jan balstad 
heavy water is used as a coolant in some nuclear reactors it 
also can be used in the chemical process turning uranium into 
plutonium for nuclear explosives 
the water is made by norsk hydro as a byproduct in its fertilizer 
production norway has exported about 450 tons of heavy water to 
nearly 40 countries since the 1930s annual production has fallen to 
about two tons

the government protested to cuba on thursday 
about its refusal to allow a european human rights delegation into 
the country a foreign ministry spokesman said 
the president of the argentine committee on human rights in cuba 
said immigration officials in havana also refused to let her into 
cuba and put her on a plane back to mexico city 
senators loyola del palacio and javier camara and maria paz 
martinez prieto head of the spanish committee on human rights in 
cuba were part of the delegation that arrived in havana on 
wednesday 
ms del palacio said they were frisked by soldiers photographed 
and pushed onto a plane for the return trip 
we were repeatedly punched pushed around had our hair pulled 
then were shoved around she said 
the cuban embassy in madrid described the trip as a 
provocation 
cubas official news agency prensa latina said the visit from the 
socalled human rights group was a new type of aggression by 
the united states 
it was an apparently noble mission but the theme of human 
rights is like a trojan horse in the current confrontation between 
cuban and the united states said a prensa latina dispatch 
monitored in mexico city 
granma cubas official communist party newspaper said 
provocateurs penetrated our country agents of the cia in the 
guise of tourists 
maria teresa reviriego of the argentine committee said she was 
told she needed a special visa because of her human rights 
affiliation and the refusal to admit her shows a fear on the part 
of the government 
on the visa application i put the reason for my visit was to 
know cuban and the cuban people she said thats the truth why 
would you need a special visa for that 
she said she would apply for a special visa friday at the cuban 
embassy in mexico city 
ms martinez prieto quoted a cuban official at the havana airport 
as saying he had reason to believe the visit was suspect because 
former cuban dissident armando valladares us representative to 
the un human rights commission in geneva was seen with the 
delegation at madrids airport 
granma also mentioned valladares being at the madrid airport and 
said the visitors planned to orchestrate an anticuban show 
prensa latina said radio marti the us government station that 
broadcasts to cuba had been carrying advance reports on the visit 
for five months

to boaters a boston whaler is instantly 
identifiable by its smirk a horizontal crease in the bow of 
every one of the 165000 boats that the company has sold since its 
founding in 1958 
today however the boston whaler co has more justification than 
ever for that smirk 
the simple sturdy decidedly unsexy whaler has succeeded this 
year in transferring its appeal from the recreational boating market 
to the commercial market winning customers as diverse as the us 
marines the bangladesh ambulance corps and the kingdom of saudi 
arabia 
last week the company announced it had won a 27 million 
contract to produce 32 military patrol boats for saudi arabia two 
of the 27foot fiberglass launches are to be customized for king 
fahd and a mosque 
each of the kings two launches will have twin 300horsepower 
outboard motors an outsized powerplant that can push a whaler to 
more than 50 miles per hour 
the 30 other boats costing 80000 a piece will be equipped 
with sirens radar machine gun mounts and 225horsepower motors 
the saudia arabian contract which required state department 
approval came on the heels of a 5 million contract to manufacture 
122 small landing craft for the marines 
boston whalers also are standard equipment for the royal canadian 
mounted police us customs service and us coast guard and the 
company has sold boats to government agencies in asia and the 
caribbean 
its amazing said company spokesman paul d foster i 
dont know how these people find out about us but i know there are 
boston whalers being used as ambulances in bangladesh patrol boats 
in macao all over 
for 30 years the humble boston whaler has been a hotselling 
pleasure boat for one main reason it is virtually unsinkable 
that trait is a result of the boats composite construction a 
sandwich of buoyant foam in fiberglass it is a characteristic that 
appeals particularly to novice or safetyconscious boaters and one 
the company has trumpeted in a series of sensational advertisements 
in one ad a boston whaler remains afloat even though it has been 
cut in half in another the boat does not sink even when a crane 
lowers a volvo sedan onto it 
that seaworthiness makes the boston whaler a natural for military 
patrols and coastal surveillance but until the early 1980s the 
company sold virtually all of its boats to fishermen waterskiers 
and other pleasure boat users 
only in the last five years has boston whaler made a substantial 
move into the commercial market which now accounts for about 20 
percent of its 66 million in annual sales according to foster 
headquartered in rockland mass about 15 miles southeast of 
boston boston whaler has about 650 employees producing 5500 boats 
a year 
it is owned by cml co a publicly traded firm that also owns 
retail stores and clothing catalogs including the nature co 
carroll reed and britches of georgetown 
while boston whalers range in size from 9 to 31 feet and in price 
from 2300 to 127000 all have the same basic foam and fiberglass 
construction making them virtual life rafts 
the ads are real eyecatchers said foster but theyre 
also true

the future farmers of america took 
farmers out of its name thursday in a change designed to show 
there are other agricultural careers besides working down on the 
farm 
delegates to the national convention voted to change the name to 
national ffa organization the culmination of a fiveyear movement 
to broaden the organizations appeal about 23000 delegates are 
attending the convention 
the students who are already in have no concerns about the 
name said bill stagg director of information for the 
416000member organization 
but the new students those people have an awfully tough time 
getting beyond our name they are not interested in farming and it 
was difficult for them to take on a jacket and associate themselves 
with the word farmer he said 
the change was made in hopes of counteracting a 23 percent loss 
of membership that has occurred since the mid1970s 
the problem we were experiencing was in the suburban and urban 
areas where those kids are not preparing to be farmers said 
stagg adding that ffas largest chapter was in philadelphia and its 
third largest was in chicago 
interests of ffa members include horticulture forestry 
agriculture mechanics agricultural journalism research and 
marketing stagg said 
the ffa is made up of high school students who develop 
agricultural skills through competitions and also become active in 
community projects

the leader of the afghan rebel alliance on 
thursday criticized a un diplomat who mediated the afghanistan 
accords acusing him of bias against the islamic insurgents and of 
trying to keep them out of power 
burhanuddin rabbani leader of the sevenparty afghan guerrilla 
coalition also rejected any future role in government for 
afghanistans premier mohammad hassan sharq calling him a 
wellknown soviet agent whose hands are dirty with the blood of 
our people 
rabbani told reporters that presidentelect george bush assured 
him earlier thursday in washington that us aid for the rebels who 
call themselves the mujahedeen or holy warriors will continue as 
before 
he met in the afternoon with secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar at un headquarters the first time the un chief has met 
with any leaders of the afghan guerrilla alliance 
the united states has been supplying the rebels with stinger 
missiles and other military and humanitarian aid in their campaign 
to drive the soviet army out of afghanistan the soviets intervened 
in afghanistan in 1979 to bolster a communist government 
moscow began withdrawing its more than 100000 troops from 
afghanistan may 15 under the unmediated accords signed last april 
in geneva by afghanistan pakistan the united states and soviet 
union 
half the troops were out by aug 15 and the accords call for the 
withdrawal to be completed by feb 15 a soviet foreign ministry 
official said last week that the rebel attacks could delay the 
pullout 
rabbani accused the un mediator diego cordovez of trying to 
cut the rebels out of any future afghan government 
we believe that the united nations is not only cordovez the 
secretarygenerals special representative for afghanistan said 
rabbani speaking farsi and accompanied by a translator 
unfortunately mr cordovez could not be an impartial 
representative of the united nations he took sides and he took 
sides against the afghan people and the mujahedeen and this is why 
he failed in his mandate rabbani said 
he did not specify whose side he believed cordovez supposedly had 
taken 
cordovez who became foreign minister of ecuador last summer 
continues to serve as the uns special representative on 
afghanistan 
he has been trying to persuade afghanistans exiled king mohammed 
zahir shah who now lives in rome to form a government of national 
reconciliation with other former afghan politicians now in exile 
afghan president najibs government has refused to relinquish 
power and the rebels have sworn to continue fighting the red army 
rabbani has said the rebels will hold democratic elections among 
afghans in territory they now control said to be more than 
twothirds of the country and among refugees and exiles to elect a 
national council 
the council he has said would then adopt a constitution and 
hold national elections to form a broadbased government excluding 
only senior officials of the current communist government 
sharq and najib are among those whom rabbani said could have no 
role in any future afghan government

the worlds first dualchamber pacemaker to 
use nuclear power was implanted in the chest of a 47yearold man 
this week and doctors said the atomic energy source will help the 
device last as long as 40 years 
theoretically this pacemaker will last a lifetime said dr 
victor parsonnet who operated on john sniffen of clifton on tuesday 
at beth israel medical center here 
pacemakers which regulate the heartbeat have been around for 
years but the device given to sniffen is the first dualchambered 
design powered by plutonium while conventional batterypowered 
pacemakers must be replaced every five to eight years sniffens is 
expected to last from 20 to 40 years 
singlechamber nuclear pacemakers exist and last about 16 years 
but the twochamber design more naturally maintains the human 
hearts twostep rhythm when the heart beats the lower part 
squeezes blood into the upper chamber where a second squeeze then 
sends the blood into the rest of the body 
the pulsarn1 pacemaker an oblong device about 2 inches wide 
and an inch thick is placed between the skin and the muscle of the 
chest wall 
two wires are threaded through a vein to the heart where they 
are attached to the upper and lower chambers alternately jolting 
them with electrical impulses and adapting to the patients rate of 
activity parsonnet explained at a news conference thursday 
singlechamber pacemakers only stimulate the lower chamber said 
parsonnet who helped implant the first usmade singlechamber 
nuclearpowered pacemaker in 1973 
doctors developed a dualchamber pacemaker in 1974 but the power 
source was a lithium battery that has a lifetime of five to eight 
years 
nuclear pacemakers powered by plutonium 238 encased in titanium 
do not emit harmful levels of radiation doctors said 
of the 3000 to 4000 put in worldwide theres never been any 
evidence of the isotope plutonium doing any harm to the patient or 
the environment parsonnet said 
the average abdominal xray dose is about twice what you would 
get from the nuclear pacers said david l purdy president of 
biocontrol technology the indiana pa company that manufactures 
the device 
sniffen who was listed in good condition told reporters the 
singlechamber nuclearpowered pacemaker he received in 1975 gave 
him jolts every once in a while and i was totally aware of it 
now i feel good a little weak from the operation but other 
than that its real nice he said 
a photocopying and facsimile machine salesman sniffen suffers 
from intermittent heart block a condition that makes the heart stop 
occasionally and can cause the patient to faint 
parsonnet said that with its greater longevity the new device 
can eliminate the need for replacement operations reducing the 
physical and emotional stress on the patient and saving money 
but the new pacemaker also has its drawbacks 
hospitals have to be licensed to implant the nuclear devices and 
patients have to be registered with the nuclear regulatory 
commission to use them 
the dualchamber nuclear device also costs more about 6000 
compared to for 4500 for its lithium counterpart and it is also 
bigger and weighs more 
the major issue is the paperwork and the size purdy said

an animal welfare group on thursday 
returned to the north sea the first seal to be cured of a virus that 
has killed thousands of the mammals in northern european waters this 
year 
the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals said 
it released the 4yearold female gray seal nicknamed godzilla 
five miles off the eastern city of norfolk 
to everyones great relief godzilla stretched out lowered her 
head and then shuffled off into the sea a spokesman said it 
was a very moving sight because she was obviously glad to be going 
back where she belonged 
the spokesman said godzilla had been given seven weeks of 
intensive care after being brought ashore by divers sept 17 
the groups chief inspector mike goodenough said godzilla was 
named after the horrorfilm monster who fought king kong because of 
the horrendous noise she made thundering around in the pen 
at least 11000 seals have died this year in northern european 
waters of an epidemic western experts believe to be caused by a 
virus similar to the canine distemper virus 
when godzilla was first brought to veterinarians she weighed 55 
pounds and was coughing badly said the spokesman who requested 
anonymity after treatment to combat lungworm and other infections 
her weight more than doubled to 121 pounds and blood tests showed 
she had built up antibodies against the disease he said 
this isnt just a bambi story about rescuing a dear little 
animal and nursing it back to health he said we hope that 
godzilla with her high level of antibodies will breed and strengthen 
the remaining common seal population 
the sea mammal research unit at cambridge north of london said 
its latest figures showed between 80 and 90 percent of the 
7000strong seal population off englands coast had died in the 
epidemic

jim and tammy bakker along with a former 
top aide must repay 77 million to ptl for reaping undeserved 
profits and mismanaging the tv ministry us bankruptcy judge rufus 
reynolds ordered thursday 
reynolds said he determined that the bakkers and former ptl vice 
president david taggart were overpaid during their last four years 
at the ministry 
ptl now under administration of the bankruptcy court sued the 
bakkers and taggart last feb 1 for 52 million alleging they 
grossly mismanaged the ministry by taking huge sums for personal use 
between 1984 and 1987 while ptl couldnt pay its bills 
during the suits trial before reynolds in september and october 
ptl dropped its claim to all but 77 million reynolds judgment is 
the first time any court has ruled that bakker or other ptl leaders 
used ptl donors money improperly 
in the order signed wednesday and filed thursday reynolds said 
jim bakker who founded ptl and left in march 1987 after admitting 
to a tryst with former church secretary jessica hahn must pay ptl 
49 million tammy bakker his wife and former cohost of the ptl 
club television show must repay 677397 and taggart must repay 1 
million 
in addition reynolds ordered bakker and taggart jointly must 
repay ptl another 1 million taggart was fired in april 1987 after 
bakker handed over control of ptl to the rev jerry falwell 
reynolds in his 50page explanation for the judgments said the 
expenditures at ptl under the bakker administration were 
unbelievable and a waste of ptls money he also accused the 
administrators of gross mismanagement and total disregard for 
reality 
the judge rejected bakkers attempts during the trial to justify 
the 66 million in salary and bonuses he and his wife collected 
between 1984 and 1987 
reynolds said in his order in conforming with the religious 
overture of this case this court observes that james bakker either 
overlooked or ignored parts of the bible including 1 timothy 610 
for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some 
coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves 
through with many sorrows 
reynolds said galatians 67 should be applied to the ptl case 
be not deceived god is not mocked for whatever a man soweth 
that shall he also reap 
reynolds also said it appeared the ptl board of directors was 
never informed that the ministry and christian theme park near fort 
mill was in any kind of precarious financial position 
bakker and taggart reynolds said approached the management of 
the corporation with reckless indifference to the financial 
consequences of their acts 
we plan to appeal said ryan hovis an rock hill attorney 
representing the bakkers hovis said he could not comment on 
reynolds order but said bakker could not repay the ministry because 
he doesnt have anything 
hovis said bakker is obviously disappointed as i think anybody 
would expect him to be 
a secretary at the bakkers new organization jim and tammy 
ministries in pineville nc said jim bakker will not comment 
until he reads the order 
taggarts attorney ben cotten of washington did not immediately 
respond to a message left on the answering machine seeking comment 
a federal grand jury in charlotte has been investigating bakker 
and other former ptl officials for more than a year 
last month bakker and several former ptl associates were 
notified they are targets of that investigation which focuses on 
possible mail and wire fraud conspiracy and criminal tax violations 
ptl attorney brad leggett said thursday that although the bakkers 
and taggart have the right to appeal reynoldss judgment to us 
district court ptl intends to begin trying to collect 
we will start procedures to locate their property which can be 
sold to pay the judgment leggett said 
it was unclear how much money and property remains in the 
bakkers names as they are living in a home supporters rent for 
them

osteoporosis though most common among women also 
affects men and may be associated with alcoholism a hormone 
deficiency or both says a new report 
the disease in men and women can lead to injuries such as hip 
fractures that cause big public health costs mortality and 
disability said dr c conrad johnston an endocrinologist at the 
indiana university school of medicine 
traditionally osteoporosis is considered a disease of women 
but it affects men too said johnston it is a problem that 
involves older men and as men live longer it will become a bigger 
health problem 
his findings were published in fridays issue of the journal of 
the american medical association 
dr murray j favus an endocrinologist and director of the bone 
program at the university of chicago said research suggests that by 
age 70 onequarter of the women in north america will have 
sustained a fracture related to osteoporosis 
probably fewer than 10 percent of the known cases of osteoporosis 
are among men though im sure there is a lot more of it out there 
than we see he said thursday adding there has not been much 
research on osteoporosis in men 
osteoporosis results in a loss of bone density and may be 
accompanied by increasing porosity and brittleness most common in 
women it can lead to spinal crush fractures that cause dowagers 
hump and pain said johnston 
men have more bone mass than women at maturity and they do not 
have the accelerated loss associated with menopause said johnson 
so they have two advantages more bone to start with and not 
losing as much 
favus said a lack of estrogen following menopause is the main 
factor in osteoporosis in women but with men often we dont know 
the cause 
johnston said spinal crush fractures are six to seven times more 
common in women but hip fractures are only about twice as common in 
women 
the hip fracture is the one that produces the big public health 
costs mortality and disability said johnston 
he said there seem to be more secondary causes of osteoporosis in 
men particularly alcoholism and a lack of the hormone testosterone 
smoking also can increase the risk of osteoporosis johnston said 
if secondary causes are treated or ruled out doctors should make 
sure patients have an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin d 
along with exercise said johnston 
osteoporosis is silent there is no clue until they fracture 
something said favus there needs to be more awareness about 
osteoporosis among physicians and among men

maestro lorin maazel returned to his musical 
roots thursday night to direct the pittsburgh symphony orchestra 
which he first joined in his teens as a fulltime violinist and 
apprentice conductor 
maazel made his debut as music director of the 100member 
orchestra filling a vacancy created by the departure of andre 
previn more than four years ago 
it was a happy and muchheralded homecoming for maazel 58 who 
has worked with orchestras in west germany england and france 
i enjoy being here i am an american and i feel my place is in 
this country even though ive conducted so much abroad he said 
during a rehearsal break wednesday 
maazels presence on the podium thursday night was his first 
public appearance as the symphonys music director he had been 
serving since 1984 as music consultant and adviser for the symphony 
considered to be among the nations best orchestras 
orchestra officials are counting on maazel to be the symphonys 
ticket to greater international recognition and renewed financial 
success the symphony has a projected 198788 loss of 15 million 
its largest ever 
officials say the orchestras financial problems stem from fewer 
anticipated grants rising operating costs and the opening of the 
benedum center for the performing arts the new hall lured away the 
local opera and ballet companies resulting in lost rentals 
managing director gideon toeplitz said a 3 million grant from 
the vira i heinz endowment helps make maazel one of the highest 
paid conductors in the nation he declined to provide specifics 
i can guarantee to you if we would have paid less to somebody 
the quality would have gone by much faster than the money 
would toeplitz said 
maazel said his first priority is to make the pittsburgh symphony 
orchestra more visible worldwide 
its a question of presentation and projection he said 
now because of my appointment people are thinking about 
pittsburgh and discovering the values that theyve had all along 
he said classical music is on an upswing in america 
were rediscovering values like the family homegrown apples 
and with it i think will come a heightened awareness of classical 
music he said 
maazels formal highbrow style contrasts sharply with that of 
previn who shocked local audiences when he suddently shed his 
tuxedo for a black vest and open white shirt near the end of his 
reign in pittsburgh 
maazel born in paris to american parents moved to pittsburgh as 
a youth to study violin under vladimir bakaleinikoff he attended 
pittsburghs peabody high school and the university of pittsburgh 
where he studied literature and philosophy 
maazels mother marie recently retired as head of a local youth 
orchestra 
in 1984 maazel had resigned amid controversy as director of the 
vienna state opera a post he held for nearly two years following 10 
years with the cleveland orchestra 
maazel accepted the job of pittsburghs music director in late 
1986 his contract runs through the 199192 season 
toeplitz said maazels arrival in pittsburgh this week had an 
immediate impact 
he walked on stage wednesday and within a few second it was 
like a miracle it became a firstrate ensemble toeplitz said 
ive been around conductors all my life and i dont remember 
seeing that kind of thing happen

the justice department set off a confrontation 
thursday with the irancontra prosecutor by telling a judge that a 
prosecution brief filed in oliver l norths case mischaracterizes 
basic constitutional principles 
in an unusual move the department sought court permission to 
file a brief in norths case to articulate clearly and 
definitively the executives view of the relationship between the 
president and the congress 
the department said a brief filed last month by independent 
counsel lawrence e walsh contains numerous statements that are 
inconsistent with previously articulated statements of the law by 
the department of justice and other executive branch agencies and 
departments 
walshs brief in support of charges that north and three 
codefendants conspired to defraud the government by diverting 
usiran armssale profits to the nicaraguan contras 
mischaracterizes basic constitutional principles of separation of 
powers and executive branch authority the justice department said 
the filing was made by assistant attorneys general edward sg 
dennis jr head of the criminal division and douglas w kmiec of 
the office of legal counsel 
department officials refused to specify the legal disagreements 
with walsh 
but the filing referred to a pleading in which walsh discussed 
the workings of the boland amendment a series of restrictions on 
military aid to the contras that were enacted by congress 
walshs brief disputed norths position that the boland amendment 
didnt apply to the national security council where the former 
presidential aide had worked before he was fired two years ago 
a 1985 memo by bretton sciaroni the counsel to president 
reagans intelligence oversight board said the boland amendment did 
not apply to the nsc staff 
the justice department said it needs until nov 25 to file its 
legal views saying walsh effectively precluded the department of 
justice from advising the ic independent counsel prior to the 
filing of its memorandum of the departments views with respect to 
separation of powers and executive authority 
the filing drew a tart response from walshs office which issued 
a statement saying the independent counsel rejects the suggestion 
that it should have solicited the views of the department of justice 
or that it has mischaracterized the law 
while the independent counsel does not object to the submission 
of legal views by the department it strenuously opposes this wholly 
unjustified 11thhour motion for an extension of time the 
statement said 
the justice department said it does not seek to support either 
the motions filed by the defendant or walshs efforts to defeat 
those motions 
accordingly the department does not intend to argue for or 
against dismissal of count one of the indictment 
the department said it decided wednesday to make the filing after 
consulting the white house the national security council the state 
and defense departments and the cia 
the filing came hours after gesell had rebuked north in an 
opinion saying his argument to dismiss charges he lied reveals a 
skewed attitude toward our form of constitutional government 
gesell had denied defense motions to dismiss charges that the 
former national security council aide obstructed reagans november 
1986 inquiry into the irancontra affair by destroying documents and 
lying to thenattorney general edwin meese iii 
north fails to appreciate the gravity of his alleged conduct 
gesell wrote in a scathing opinion that denounced the retired marine 
lieutenant colonels contention that no laws were broken when he 
lied to meese and destroyed documents 
the judge rejected defense arguments that north cannot be 
prosecuted for lying to meese because the attorney generals 
questioning was not part of a pending proceeding before a 
government agency 
north is charged with lying when among other things he denied 
to meese any national security council involvement in diverting 
armssale proceeds to the contras 
gesell dismissed norths contention that he had an absolute 
right to lie to obstruct such inquiries and to remove or destroy 
official nsc records because he had not been warned that if he did 
so he might be indicted 
there is nothing in the constitution federal statutes or 
applicable decisions which warrants this cynical approach he said 
the judge also rejected norths suggestion that he cannot be 
prosecuted because he was not put on notice that criminal statutes 
long in effect would be applied to him if he acted corruptly as 
alleged 
walsh will need only to prove at trial that the specific 
questions posed to north by the attorney general were precise and 
material to this legitimate presidential inquiry and that north 
purposely lied the judge said 
north is charged with conspiring with former national security 
adviser john m poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim and retired 
air force maj gen richard v secord to illegally divert usiran 
armssale profits to the nicaraguan rebels 
no date has been set for any of the four trials ordered by gesell 
for each defendant

the president of parliament called the 
early years of the hitler era a glorious time for many germans 
triggering a walkout during the governments ceremony thursday 
marking the kristallnacht 
the remarks by philipp jenniger threatened to overshadow west 
germanys carefully planned ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary 
of the kristallnacht the night the nazis began their first 
organized assault against the jews 
but a leader of west germanys jewish community michael fuerst 
defended jenningers speech saying it was simply describing the 
situation in germany during those years fuerst said he did not 
understand the calls for jenninger to resign 
i welcome that the parliament president described in full 
clarity what was happening in germany between 1933 and 1938 
fuerst a deputy chairman of the central council of jews in west 
germany said in a television interview 
especially the fact that everything that hitler did was 
strongly supported by the masses of all germans he added 
jenningers remarks prompted demands for his resignation by 
members of the opposition greens and social democrats who were 
among about 50 who marched out of the hall during the nationally 
televised speech to parliament 
the national ard and zdf television networks both reported late 
thursday that jenninger was expected to resign shortly 
the bonn daily newspaper die welt which is close to chancellor 
helmut kohls conservative government said jenninger was expected 
to announce his resignation friday 
in its early friday edition die welt said kohl strongly 
criticized jenninger at a private meeting thursday but left it to 
jenninger whether to resign 
social democrat chairman hansjochen vogel said in a letter to 
jenninger a conservative that the parliament president had shown a 
disturbing lack of judgment in his speech 
in his speech the 56yearold jenninger had talked at length 
about the positive feelings of many ordinary germans early in the 
hitler dictatorship 
didnt hitler bring to reality what kaiser wilhelm ii had 
only promised that is to lead the germans to glorious times wasnt 
he chosen by providence a fuehrer such as is given to a people only 
once in a thousand years jenninger asked 
for the fate of the germans and european jews hitlers 
successes were perhaps even more fateful than his crimes and 
misdeeds jenninger said the years from 1933 to 1938 even from 
a distant retrospective and in the knowledge of what followed still 
are a fascinating thing today since throughout history there was 
hardly a parallel to hitlers triumphal procession during the first 
years 
jenninger then cited such events as inclusion of the saarland 
austria and part of czechoslovakia into the third reich as well as 
the 1936 summer olympics in berlin 
but some listeners also had sobbed when jenninger read an 
eyewitness account of the murder of concentration camp victims in 
1942 
blood was running over the shoulders of almost everyone he 
read some of those shot were still moving some lifted their arms 
and turned their heads to show they were still alive 
in jerusalem israels foreign ministry said it was astonished by 
jenningers speech 
we have known dr jenninger for years as the man who headed 
many friendly delegations to israel it said in a statement 
the way of interpreting the nazi era and the description of its 
historical background in his speech are unacceptable for any jew 
it said it was a miserable speech whatever the original 
intentions may be 
edgar bronfman president of the new yorkbased world jewish 
congress said in a statement that jenningers remarks were 
reprehensible and demanded an urgent explanation 
later thursday a greens lawmaker said jenningers speech showed 
that antisemitism exists in the hearts of many members of this 
house 
the statement by jutta oesterleschwerin brought loud jeers from 
other lawmakers and parliament vicepresident annemarie renger 
several times tried to interrupt mrs oesterleschwerins speech 
finally shutting off the microphone 
starting with the kristallnacht of nov 910 1938 the nazis 
made clear their intentions to wipe out european jews on that 
night nazi thugs destroyed jewish homes businesses and synagogues 
sending 30000 jews to concentration camps and killing 91 jews 
shattered glass covered the streets and the nazis in a boastful 
mood named it kristallnacht which in english is crystal night 
the nazis killed 6 million jews and many others during hitlers 
rule from 1933 to 1945 
before jenninger spoke at the governments ceremonies an 
88yearold nazi concentration camp survivor ida ehre read from paul 
celans poem todesfuge one of the most dramatic poems about the 
holocaust 
death is a master from germany his eye is blue ms ehre an 
actress and director in hamburg read he strikes thee with leaden 
bullets he strikes thee exactly 
in communist east berlin thousands of people gathered at one of 
europes largest synagogues for ceremonies marking the start of its 
restoration timed to coincide with the kristallnacht rememberances

fire touched off a chemical explosion at a 
printing plant thursday sending 17 people to hospitals with burns 
cuts and bruises and forcing an evacuation at the states largest 
newspaper 
the injured included 15 firefighters who were blown through the 
air by an explosion as they used water and chemicals to fight the 
second of two fires at the plant said city fire capt keith 
milliner he said none of the firefighters injuries were believed 
to be serious 
two pressmen at the standard gravure plant were taken to 
hospitals for treatment of seconddegree burns on their arms and 
faces officials said 
production of the courierjournal was disrupted by the evacuation 
of that newspapers building which is adjacent to the printing 
plant and also houses the main office for kentucky of the associated 
press workers were allowed back into the building at 10 pm but 
power was not fully restored immediately 
george gill president and publisher of the courierjournal said 
his staff was going to go back to the oldfashioned way to put 
out fridays editions 
courierjournal staffers set up with typewriters and telephones 
in an old companyowned building across the street 
gill said editors planned to dictate their copy to the lexington 
heraldleader 80 miles away and fridays editions would be printed 
there the two newspapers are statewide competitors but have an 
agreement to help each other through such emergencies 
naphtha a volatile chemical used to thin ink in printing was 
believed responsible for the explosion said art smithers night 
supervisor at the plant which prints magazines and color 
advertising materials 
smithers said the first fire broke out about 6 pm in one of the 
presses injuring the two pressmen a coworker press operator 
walter emert identified them as jim sitzler and jim lucas 
workers around them did what they were supposed to do we ran 
like hell said emert 52 
a chemical fire exinguisher came on automatically he said 
workers were cleaning up from the first fire when the second 
flared apparently ignited by embers contacting newsprint and ink on 
the floor smithers said 
firefighters had entered with chemicals and hoses to put out the 
inkrelated fire when naphtha on the floor and in the air ignited 
without warning smithers said 
milliner said the force of the blast lifted firefighters off 
their feet knocking some into walls and through doors 
the explosion which occurred about 1 hours after the first 
fire also left a gaping twostory hole in the rear wall of the 
sixstory standard gravure building 
injured firefighters staggered from the building coughing and 
gasping and some appeared dazed they were given oxygen masks put

a judge on thursday ordered federal prison 
officials to allow inmates to write bylined newspaper articles for 
pay and to stop retaliating against a prisoner who wrote an article 
criticizing a warden 
us district judge charles legge said he was persuaded that the 
inmate whose transfer started the case dannie martin posed no 
threat to safety or order within the institution by his writing 
and was being punished only for the content of his articles in the 
san francisco chronicle 
legge issued a nationwide preliminary injunction prohibiting the 
bureau of prisons from enforcing seldomused rules that forbid 
federal prisoners from receiving pay or using bylines when writing 
for newspapers and other outside publications 
he said officials had allowed many prisoners to write articles or 
books for pay and had failed to show that enforcement of the ban 
against martin or anyone else would promote safety or any other 
valid concern in running the prisons 
he also said a rule that prohibits inmates from running 
businesses in prison cannot be enforced against writers the 
injunction is binding until martins suit goes to trial 
since the case arose martin has been transferred from a 
california federal prison to a prison near phoenix 
the chronicle asked legge to return martin to california where 
his observations would have more value for the newspapers readers 
the judge said he was uncertain about security and space 
considerations and asked the lawyers to consult one another 
assistant us attorney sandra willis said she was surprised by 
the ruling and particularly by legges refusal to rule out damage 
awards against prison officials involved in martins case she said 
no decision has been made on an appeal 
martin 48 began serving a 33year sentence for bank robbery in 
1981 he started sending articles to the chronicle about two years 
ago on his observations about prison life and conditions at the 
federal prison in lompoc calif where he then was confined 
this june he was placed in solitary confinement three days after 
the chronicle ran his article criticizing lompocs new warden rh 
rison martin then was transferred twice in the next two weeks 
his suit joined by the chronicle contended that martin was 
being treated unfairly and that the regulations prohibiting bylined 
and paid articles by prisoners violated constitutional freedom of 
expression 
willis the governments lawyer declared this is not a 
censorship case and argued that the ban on bylined and paid 
outside articles was justified by security considerations 
the money that mr martin was trying to earn caused him to look 
for and say things he might not otherwise have said such as 
interviewing other prisoners willis said you cant control an 
inmate who has his own money 
but legge said other prisoners had been allowed to earn money 
and that there was substantial evidence that the actions against 
martin were based on the content of his writings

doctors announced thursday they have implanted 
fetal tissue into the brain of a patient with parkinsons disease in 
experimental surgery aimed at curtailing the diseases symptoms 
the doctors who performed the surgery at the university of 
colorado health sciences center said they believed the operation was 
the first of its kind in the united states 
curt freed who headed the surgery team said the operation has 
been performed on a few parkinsons patients in mexico and sweden 
but he added the results have been far from satisfactory 
freed said the eighthour surgery wednesday was on a 52yearold 
denver man who has had parkinsons for 20 years 
parkinsons disease results from the loss of brain cells that 
produce a substance called dopamine symptoms include tremors slow 
movement rigidity in the limbs and stooped posture 
freed a professor of medicine and pharmacology said his 
experiments on monkeys indicate that fetal tissue implanted in the 
adult brain can begin producing dopamine and possibly curtail 
parkinsons symptoms 
he said the fetal cells are exactly like seeds which could 
take up to six months to grow spread and reenergize the brain 
the controversial fetalcell implants have been used in recent 
years in an effort to help diabetics and most notably radiation 
victims of the nuclear power plant accident at chernobyl in the 
soviet union freed said 
some abortion opponents have claimed fetalcell implants could 
encourage more women to have abortions 
freed said many researchers in the us are primed to use 
fetalcell implants on parkinsons patients but he believes his 
experiment was the first 
cu neurosurgeon robert breeze who actually transplanted the 
cells wednesday said they were implanted with needles through a 
hole in the top of the skull to the area deep in the brain where 
dopamine acts 
the patient who has asked not to be identified was conscious 
throughout the operation and was recovering well thursday breeze 
said 
were happy to see that the patient tolerated the procedure so 
well and now its a waiting period said freed at a news 
conference 
the two milligrams of tissue used wednesday were obtained after 
an abortion performed by a physician who wasnt involved in the 
research the doctors said 
the cu researchers stressed that the woman gave her consent to 
the use of the tissue and she wasnt paid for it 
freed said his scientific research shouldnt be confused with the 
political issue of abortion 
wed like to separate the case of fetal tissue from the act of 
abortion which is clearly a political issue he said given the 
abortions happened can we throw this stuff away 
fetal cells have much more flexibility they will grow under 
conditions where adult cells wont grow he said 
the tissue must come from a fetus aged 6 weeks to 9 weeks 
the surgery was approved by the centers human subjects 
committee and was funded through private donations freed said he 
estimated the operation would end up costing about 10000 
the standard treatment for parkinsons disease has been a drug 
called ldopa which has proven effective in the early stages of the 
disease but becomes less effective as parkinsonism becomes more 
severe 
freed said the patient has been unable to work for several years 
despite heavy doses of drugs every 2 hours 
freed was cautious about predicting how much the mans condition 
could improve as a result of the surgery 
we expect general mobility would improve and hopefully a 
reduction in drug needs he said 
freed said the cu team intends to perform more fetalcell 
implants on parkinsons patients in the future

leaders of the church of england on thursday voted 
to set a quota of 24 black representatives on their 574member 
general synod which now has only eight blacks 
with little more than half its members present the synod debated 
for 2 hours then voted 21474 with 11 abstentions for the quota 
the archbishop of york the most rev john habgood said the 
change would encourage blacks to run for election to the synod in 
their church parishes 
we need to increase their representation in the church as a 
whole because black people in our midst have a great contribution to 
make habgood said 
the vote followed a report from the churchs committee for black 
anglican concerns proposing the change for the next synod elections 
in 1990 
the churchs first black bishop to serve in england 
barbadosborn bishop of croydon wilfred wood who chairs the 
committee said after the vote im gratified by it i hope 
black people will come forward and take their places in the church 
of england 
synod candidates for election in 1990 will have to complete an 
ethnic monitoring questionnaire if the number of blacks elected 
falls below 24 the quota will be made up from unsuccessful black 
candidates with the highest votes 
john gummer the conservative governments local government 
minister and a leading member of the synod opposed the motion which 
he called apartheid in reverse 
gummer said the problem was that not enough blacks ran for the 
synod and the church should do more by asking blacks to be 
candidates 
there are no statistics on how many blacks there are in the 
church of england which has about 1 million regular sunday 
worshipers and has been in slow decline for most of this century 
woods committee estimates englands black community may be 
almost 7 percent of the 49 million population

for three years charles s robb was out of 
the spotlight that had become so familiar first as the soninlaw 
of president lyndon johnson and then as democratic governor of this 
conservative state 
but on tuesday the 49yearold lawyer reentered the national 
arena in decisive style fashioning a huge victory over republican 
longshot maurice dawkins a retired black minister and washington 
lobbyist 
robb said today he won because we attempted to identify with 
mainstream values that are crucial to success at the national 
level such as strong defense and fiscal responsibility 
with 99 percent of the precincts counted robb had 1448389 
votes or 71 percent to dawkins 587887 votes or 29 percent 
the former marine combat officer has built a career by making 
democrats electable in conservative virginia 
once known only as the former white house military social aide 
who married lbjs daughter lynda bird johnson he won the 
lieutenant governors race in 1977 in his first bid for elective 
office 
four years later he ran for governor in the first sweep by 
democrats of the states top three offices since 1965 
robb was a popular governor who was credited with overhauling the 
state bureaucracy and making major gains in education funding he 
also opened positions of authority in state government to blacks and 
women and appointed virginias first black supreme court member 
the former governor was also one of the architects of last 
springs super tuesday presidential primary intended in part to 
give the southern vote collective strength 
but robbs tenure was shaken by prison troubles that drew 
national attention when six death row inmates escaped in may 1984 
robb who could not succeed himself under virginias 
constitution had been out of office for three years and practicing 
law until his bid for the senate 
ive been unemployed for a long time and it looks like i just

here is the text of remarks given as president 
reagan and his wife nancy welcomed presidentelect george bush and 
his wife barbara and vice presidentelect dan quayle and his wife 
marilyn to the white house rose garden on wednesday 
 
reagan thank you george and dan and bar and marilyn its 
wonderful to have you here and if anyone wants to know how nancy 
and i feel about this moment just read our smiles 
actually though i have some figures here that i thought you and 
the rest of the country might be interested in according to my 
calculations its only 1188 days to the iowa caucus 
now i think the country has heard quite enough political 
speechmaking from all of us in the past few months so i just want 
to make one or two simple but heartfelt points first i want you 
to know mr presidentelect and mr vice presidentelect how proud 
i am of both of you of the extraordinary perseverence and character 
and grit that youve shown in this difficult year 
and i think too your worthy opponents would agree what a 
challenge to human endurance a presidential campaign has become so 
i want to congratulate both of you as well as governor dukakis and 
senator bentsen in taking on the great challenge and your sense of 
public duty in seeing it through to the end each of you is better 
for it and so is the country 
now in this hardfought campaign george and dan i also want to 
compliment you for going to the people on the issues and asking for 
a mandate on critical matters like the taxing and spending power 
the nature of judicial appointments the strength of our defenses 
and the firmness of our foreign policy i think that mandate has 
been unmistakably delivered and i know in carrying it out you will 
be true to your promises and faithful to the peoples wishes 
with george bush and dan quayle i feel our achievements are 
secure our change now a permanent feature of american government 
but i also believe your mandate will make it possible not just to 
continue but to build upon the achievements of the past eight 
years this is not the end of an era but a time to refresh and 
strengthen our new beginning in fact to those who sometimes 
flatter me with talk of a reagan revolution today my hope is this 
you aint seen nothing yet 
and finally let me say that despite the long months of 
campaigning the seemingly endless controversy and the sheer human 
exhaustion of it all choosing our leaders is after all a decision 
critical to our own future to the future of this muchloved nation 
and to the cause of human freedom and thats why today americans 
of every political persuasion and background can come together as 
one 
even as we accept the verdict of the majority and pledge to 
protect always the rights of the minority we put behind us the 
divisions and controversies of the immediate past and begin anew so 
its a day for congratulations yes but its also a day for 
remembering that whatever may temporarily divide us is far 
outweighed by that which unites us 
america has much to be proud of today pledges of a new president 
and a new vice president and pledges of support from the loyal 
opposition republican democrat independent today were one 
nation one people and our national treasure our national mission 
the cause of human freedom continues to prosper and light the world 
thank you god bless you 
 
bush thank you mr president and all i will say just in the 
shadow of the office that you have enobled we are very very 
grateful to you i dont believe there is a case in modern 
presidential politics where a president has worked so hard to help 
someone else achieve this office and i will always be grateful 
i can hardly believe it but its sinking in now the enormity of 
what has taken place a peaceful election eventually a peaceful 
transfer of power 
and i just think for all the bush family and i expect i speak 
for marilyn and dan on this one and we are grateful to you and to 
nancy for going that extra mile 
and i can i really believe that the results would have been 
entirely different if we hadnt had this loyal steadfast campaign 
support and i know they would if i hadnt learned from a giant 
the good things about the united states of america 
thank you sir 
dan 
 
quayle well mr president as one who came to the senate in 
1980 thank you for all that you have done for america 
and now mr presidentelect yesterday the american people 
overwhelmingly placed their trust and their confidence in your 
leadership 
and i am delighted to be a part of that team ready to go to work 
and to continue to change america and make it even greater

a reputed mob figure in the 
philadelphiasouthern new jersey area was convicted wednesday of 
running a criminal enterprise loan sharking dealing in cocaine 
and importing a chemical used to make the drug speed 
a federal jury found albert reds pontani of trenton guilty of 
10 counts in a 12count indictment four associates also were 
convicted on various loanharking drug and illegal phone use counts 
authorities said the case struck a blow to the organization of 
alleged crime boss nicodemo little nicky scarfo who is on trial 
on racketeering charges in federal court in philadelphia 
pontani 61 faces up to life in prison 
the jury which deliberated nearly three days also convicted 
daniel marino 58 of cherry hill angelo cappy belardo 59 of 
trenton daniel muccie 58 of trenton and former camden police 
officer james wilson in his mid40s of camden 
all face lengthy prison terms at their jan 3 sentencing before 
us district judge maryanne trump barry 
the government relied on secretly taped conversations involving 
the defendants and the testimony of admitted or jailed drugdealers 
who served as paid government informants 
pontanis attorney donald manno said he would appeal the 
conviction 
its a sorry day when the government can decide in advance 
whos good and bad and set out to find a crime by paying people by 
giving immunity and other considerations none of which the 
defense could even think of doing with a witness he said 
its an even sorrier day when the jury believes those kind of 
people 
he would not comment on the governments allegations about 
pontanis organized crime ties which were not included in the 
indictment

police chief and a farmer in two attacks wednesday police said 
in perus eastern jungle dozens of guerrillas from the maoist 
shining path ambushed an army patrol killing the two soldiers and 
wounding two others police said the soldiers were patrolling on 
foot near huayranga a settlement in perus amazon jungle 270 miles 
northeast of huancayo which is 130 miles east of lima 
four soldiers were listed as missing after a brief clash that 
followed the ambush police said it was not immediately known how 
many soldiers were in the patrol and whether the guerrillas suffered 
any casualties 
the shining path has been fighting since 1980 to impose marxist 
rule in peru the insurgency erupted in the south central andes but 
has since spread to coastal urban centers and into the sparsely 
populated eastern jungle 
more than 12000 people mainly highland peasants have died in 
the violence according to the government 
also wednesday in the andean highlands a column of shining path 
guerrillas dragged a village police chief and a farmer from their 
homes before dawn and shot and killed them in the town square

students who enter livestock at a show next year 
may have their animals tested for drugs such as steroids organizers 
said 
leroy shafer assistant general manager of the houston livestock 
show said organizers wanted to assure the group of houstonians 
who support our youngsters and buy meat at our shows that the meat 
is free of any drug residue 
he said the show which attracts members of 4h and future 
farmers of america also wants to teach youngsters the 
responsibility of how to raise meat for the market under federal 
laws 
the program will affect those students who show steers pigs 
poultry and lambs that are slaughtered afterward for food it will 
not apply to professional ranchers and breeders who show animals 
used strictly for breeding shafer said 
no doubt this will be the pioneer said don goodman 
president of the greater houston large animal veterinarian 
practitioners association in my opinion if it goes off well and 
people stand behind it a lot of major shows will follow 
blood or urine samples could be taken at any time during the 
show shafer said animals testing positive for drugs would be 
disqualified prizes and money from animal sales will be held until 
drug tests are completed 
it is safe to assume that any animal who wins will be tested 
he said adding that other animals will be tested at random 
surveys at previous livestock shows in texas indicated that some 
animals had been given anabolic steroids tranquilizers and 
diuretics steroids help add bulk to animals

some editions of wednesdays ocala starbanner 
declared democrat kenneth buddy mackay the winner in his race 
against republican connie mack for the us senate 
hey buddy youre a senator read the headline on 5000 
copies of mackays hometown paper the headline parodied a 
television ad used by mack to put down mackay as a liberal 
the only problem is uncounted absentee ballots will decide the 
race 
editors decided to use the headline at 215 am wednesday when 
mackay was ahead by 10000 votes said executive editor mark mathes 
mackay made the most of the attention holding up a copy of the 
newspaper at a news conference in ocala 
ive been instructed in visual ads in this campaign mackay 
joked imitating harry s trumans reaction to the infamous headline 
that incorrectly declared thomas dewey the winner in his race for 
president 
the starbanner was not alone in its presumption all three 
television networks called mackay the winner shortly after 10 pm 
the science is not 100 percent said abc director of news 
information elise adde who said that of 68 initial projections abc

lowell p weicker jr conceded wednesday 
that his 18year career in the us senate was over and he called 
democratic joseph i liebermans victory by less than 1 percent of 
the vote a clear mandate by the people 
secretary of the state julia tashjian said wednesday night that 
the official vote totals showed lieberman won by 10052 votes a 
larger margin than the 8208vote spread the unofficial tallies 
showed 
she said it was connecticuts tightest statewide election since 
an attorney generals contest in 1970 but that it was not close 
enough to order a recount 
lieberman had 688494 votes 4976 percent to the liberal 
republicans 678442 votes or 4904 percent two thirdparty 
candidates shared 1 percent of the total 
weicker in a news conference in greenwich town hall shouldered 
the responsibility for his defeat and ruled out any future in 
politics or in the bush administration 
im a big guy i take care of myself i take shots ive given 
shots weicker said im responsible for last nights results 
i didnt lose this race by a few thousand votes he said 
in my mind and in my heart i lost it by 100000 this wasnt 
a close race it was a clear mandate by the state of connecticut 
that matters that i stood for are not to their liking and that 
matters that mr lieberman stood for are to their liking 
weicker a liberal republican said he might now choose an 
academic career he is a graduate of yale university and the 
university of virginia law school 
lieberman said the outcome reflected the voters desire for 
change and a desire for an advocate for the state which of course 
is what ive been as attorney general environment consumers 
jobs housing drugs 
secretary of state julia tashjian said final vote totals for the 
senate race would not be available until late wednesday 
connecticut voters chose republican george bush whose father 
once represented the state in the us senate over democrat michael 
dukakis bush had 739757 votes or 53 percent to dukakis 668482 
or 47 percent 
the connecticut congressional delegation three republicans and 
three democrats easily won reelection

john newton mitchell the gruff former attorney 
general who went to prison for conspiring to cover up the watergate 
scandal in his friend richard nixons white house is dead at 75 
after collapsing on a washington street 
mitchell was the highest ranking of the government officials who 
served time for the political scandal that brought about nixons 
resignation from the presidency in august 1974 
i considered john mitchell to be one of my few close personal 
friends nixon wrote in his memoirs i believed that i owed my 
election as president in 1968 largely to his strength as a counselor 
and his skill as a manager 
an ambulance crew alerted by a 10yearold boy who was 
skateboarding found mitchell unconscious on a street in the 
georgetown section of washington in early evening wednesday 
mitchell had suffered a heart attack

the male image gets something of a lift in a pbs 
series starting sunday night the nature of australia showing 
the animal world down under as more than just koalas kangaroos and 
crocodiles 
the six onehour shows on the pbs series nature are its way 
of celebrating australias bicentennial 
take for example the leafy sea dragon one of several creatures 
that practice a form of male pregnancy to protect their offspring 
this cousin of the seahorse lives off south australia and is named 
for its camouflage of leaflike outgrowths that make it look like a 
piece of kelp it hatches its young up to 200 of them in 
individual capsules that form soon after the female lays the eggs on 
the males tail 
then theres the marsupial frog a rainforest dweller whose 
hatchlings wriggle onto their fathers flanks and push their way 
into pockets that have formed there to complete their development 
brooding also is a male task in the great barrier reef among the 
australian pike fish a long thin speckled species that after an 
elaborate courtship ritual takes the eggs from the female into its 
pouch until the young emerge 
and another resident of the reef off the northeastern coast of 
australia is the yellowstriped cardinal fish which incubates 
hundreds of eggs clustered in a sticky ball in its mouth 
male pregnancy fascinates us because were used to thinking of 
females as the bearers of young but of course that seems to be only 
so among the higher mammals said john vandenbeld executive 
producer and writer of the nature of australia and author of the 
companion book for the series 
we tend to take a fairly speciescentric view of evolution and 
the world about us most creatures in the world tend to reproduce in 
very very different ways from the way we humans and most of the 
higher mamals do we probably are an exceptional group rather than 
the other way around vandenbeld said in a telephone interview 
from melbourne australia 
it fascinates us because its at such a variance with the way 
we look at things it all makes perfect sense its all logical for 
sea horses and those kinds of animals to organize their reproduction 
in that way said vandenbeld a longtime producer of 
documentaries on the environment for the australian broadcasting 
corporation 
the series episodes are a separate creation how australias 
wildlife came to be so different seas under capricorn where 
the male sea dragon gives birth the making of the bush for 
fans of maneating crocodiles the sunburnt country australias 
outback land of flood and fire with crocodileeating men and 
the end of isolation how conservationists are trying to bring 
parts of the continent back from the brink of manmade devastation 
until not so very long ago the idea most australians had about 
the environment was of a very rugged harsh and alien kind of place 
that you sort of had to conquer there was a lot of fear and 
loathing of what we call the bush among the early settlers and the 
only good tree was a tree that was cut down the only good tree was 
a dead tree said hollandborn vandenbeld 48 who emigrated to 
australia when he was 15 
that attitude obviously has changed dramatically over the last 
few years he said we have such a unique environment 
absolutely unique plants and animals in many ways its a kind of 
repository for things that have disappeared in the rest of the 
world and we still have the chance to keep many of these things 
vandenbeld also said he hopes the series will change attitudes 
about marsupials mammals that raise their young in pouches 
people tend to dismiss kangaroos and marsupials generally as 
rather secondrate animals because they organize their reproduction 
in what seemed for a long time as a kind of primitive way an 
intermediate step between reptiles and birds who have eggs and 
mammals like us who bear live young he said one of the things 
weve been able to do in this series is to demonstrate just how very 
intricately marsupial reproduction is organized how very precise 
the various facets of this reproduction are tailored to this 
particular environment and how well that reproduction is 
orchestrated

as anyone who follows the retail industry can 
tell you consumers just arent spending the way they used to sales 
at many of the nations biggest retailers have been slow for almost 
two years now 
the retailers have learned to adjust shifting the focus of their 
business from generating sales to maintaining profits and the 
investment analysts who track retail companies are stressing cost 
controls rather than revenue 
so everything is ok right maybe we dont need to worry about 
how many refrigerators sears sold last month or how the white sale 
went at lord amp taylor 
wrong the economists say 
the retailers may have figured out how to survive the slump but 
the economy and the rest of us are likely to suffer in the end 
if consumers continue to hold tightly to their purse strings 
any kind of slowdown in consumer spending will show up in 
lower production and unemployment warns david wyss chief 
financial economist for data resources inc a lexington mass 
firm that forecasts economic trends 
consumer spending accounts for about twothirds of the gross 
national product the broadest measure of the economys health if 
consumers make fewer purchases they could force the economy to slow 
down or even slip into a recession 
so far the slowdown in retail spending has not been readily 
apparent in the gnp figures the commerce department said overall 
consumer spending increased by 35 percent from july through 
september following a 3 percent rise in the second quarter 
although at the same time many big retailers reported their sales 
couldnt keep up with inflation 
whats happening is that americans are spending more on other 
things cars and the gasoline to drive them interest payments on 
mortgages and other loans medical care and their childrens tuition 
but the economists note as americans pay more for necessities 
and services they are shying away from whats known as 
discretionary spending purchases of clothing dishwashers 
furniture and other items they dont really need 
therein lies the problem a drop in such spending means 
consumers arent buying as many discretionary goods so companies 
dont have to produce as much 
and if manufacturers slow their assembly lines theyre likely to 
lay off workers 
what could save some of those jobs is continued growth in 
exports but as wyss noted exports are not a panacea for the 
entire us manufacturing sector the united states doesnt sell 
many refrigerators overseas so if the domestic market declines 
some workers may be on the street 
a slowdown is inevitable according to wyss 
the economy is expanding too rapidly he said it cant 
continue to go on 
the federal reserve board board has been tightening credit 
raising interest rates in the process to try to put the brakes on 
the economy 
but as rates rise the cost of borrowing goes up leaving 
consumers with less to spend at department and discount stores and 
so the cycle will continue 
in the long run the recession is going to occur wyss said

president rodrigo borjas first months in 
office have restored a sense of calm to ecuador wracked in recent 
years by political economic and natural disasters 
borja 53 a moderate leftist and leader of the democratic left 
party took office in august replacing his longtime political foe 
leon febres cordero a staunchly conservative and prous leader 
the mildmannered borja has spent time playing volleyball with 
reporters and officiating at local speedway races he has even 
deserted his bodyguards to get shoeshines in this colonial citys 
shady plazas 
president borja is not an autocrat enclosed in the presidential 
palace government television ads proclaim in an effort to draw a 
contrast with febres cordero who carried a colt 45 pistol and took 
pride in his macho image 
a recent poll of leading journalists indicated borjas major 
accomplishment so far has been restoring tranquility and avoiding 
repression the language was a clear reference to febres corderos 
turbulent style of governing and the frequent charges of human 
rights violations made against his government 
the currency exchange rate considered a key economic signal has 
stabilized at about 485 sucres to the us dollar after fluctuating 
wildly for the past year 
independent economists have praised recent government austerity 
measures to build up the nations depleted foreign currency reserves 
and to a cut a huge fiscal deficit and recordhigh annual inflation 
of nearly 80 percent 
in his inaugural address borja accused febres cordero of lying 
about the seriousness of the countrys financial plight and 
deliberately leaving it bankrupt to cripple his incoming government 
this coloradosized nation of 10 million people wedged between 
colombia and peru has suffered in recent years from severe economic 
problems and political instability 
the turmoil was sparked in great measure by bitter disputes 
between febres cordero and leftleaning parties that controlled 
congress which at one point debated impeaching him 
ecuadors fledgling democracy was threatened in 1986 by a 
military uprising led by gen frank vargas pazzos then air force 
commander the uprising failed and vargas pazzos was imprisoned 
febres cordero was kidnapped a year later by vargas pazzos backers 
and held for 11 hours until he pardoned the jailed general 
a devastating earthquake in 1987 that crippled the vital oil 
export industry for a half year and the collapse of international 
petroleum prices also had disastrous economic effects 
borja is ecuadors fourth president since democracy was restored 
here in 1979 following a decade of military and civilian 
dictatorships 
borjas party which is affiliated with the international social 
democrat movement controls the 71seat unicameral congress this 
has virtually eliminated any possibility of the opposition blocking 
borjas policies as occurred in the febres cordero administration 
borja has already made good on campaign pledges to seek closer 
ties with the nonaligned movment the third world and to replace 
febres corderos freemarket economic policies with greater 
government controls 
in one of his first official acts borja restored diplomatic 
relations with nicaraguas sandinista government which had been 
severed during febres corderos era cubas fidel castro in a rare 
visit to south america was a prominent guest at borjas 
inauguration so was us secretary of state george p shultz 
borja says he intends to maintain close relations with the united 
states ecuadors major trading partner 
i believe there can be good cooperation between our government 
and the government of the united states he said 
a government announcement in september of a plan to assume 
control of the petroleum production operations in ecuador of the 
us oil company texaco inc sparked concern in international 
financial circles of a leftist move to nationalize key industries 
borja quickly acted to restore confidence explaining that the 
governments intent was to gradually assume control over texaco 
operations as contracts expire 
we are open to foreign investment in terms of mutual benefit 
said energy minister diego tamariz 
borjas austerity package which included a 36 percent 
devaluation of the currency exchange controls and gasoline price 
increases has drawn its heaviest criticism from the left however 
the borja government has also announced plans to renew debt 
negotiations with foreign creditors ecuador has paid almost nothing 
on its 11 billion foreign debt since the 1987 earthquake

the dollar fell in moderate european trading this 
morning in continuing bearish reaction to george bushs presidential 
victory gold prices were mixed 
foreign exchange dealers said the dollar fell in asia and early 
european trading but recovered slightly as dealers bought dollars to 
cover short positions 
traders said the only factor preventing the dollar going lower 
was market fears of central bank intervention to prop up the us 
currency 
the bank of japan stepped in early today following intervention 
wednesday by the us federal reserve but no action by european 
central banks was sighted this morning 
there is still a bit of downward pressure but the room on the 
downside is limited one dealer at a large west german bank said 
because of the fed bank of japan interventions the market is 
hesitant to sell dollars 
a rome trader said he expected a period in which the us and 
asian markets would push the dollar lower while european markets 
would be net buyers of dollars 
he said the market was reacting to statements rather than 
fundamentals especially those by officials seeking to lay the 
groundwork for bushs economic policy 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day begins 
the dollar fell 055 yen to a closing 12410 yen later in london 
it was quoted lower at 12388 yen 
other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late wednesdays 
rates included 17595 west german marks down from 17665 14785 
swiss francs down from 14865 60059 french francs down from

the dollar fell against the japanese yen today 
while share prices edged down on the tokyo stock exchange 
the dollar finished trading at 12410 yen down 055 from 
wednesdays close of 12465 yen opening lower at 12395 yen the 
currency ranged between 12376 and 12430 yen it was the first time 
the dollar opened at the 123yen level since april 18 when it 
started trading at 12383 yen 
traders said the bank of japans intervention and buying by 
speculators near the 1237yen mark saved the dollar from declining 
further the central bank routinely declines comment on its 
activities 
meanwhile japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa said today 
the recent currency situation requires coordinated intervention 
the present currency movements arent good he added 
a dealer with mitsubishi bank said however the dollars 
downward trend still was strong in the market 
the dollar was only slightly affected by republican george bushs 
victory in the us presidential election 
although bush won as most market players had expected many of 
them are now cautious wondering how the us monetary policy will 
be after the election the dealer said speaking anonymously 
meanwhile the 225issue nikkei stock average which gained 
20551 points wednesday lost 4636 points or 016 percent to 
close at 2816642 the index gained 8622 points shortly after the 
market opened then gradually fell 
a dealer with nomura securities attributed the decline to 
profittaking mainly in electronics and hightech issues 
but the higher yen helped financial issues finish higher he 
said also speaking anonoymously 
trading was active with the volume on the first section estimated 
at 12 billion shares

just after winning a 40state election victory 
on a vow of no new taxes george bush is giving some appearances of 
flexibility on that stand at least on the topic of revenue 
enhancers 
at his first press conference as presidentelect on wednesday 
bush was asked whether his oftrepeated opposition to tax increases 
was meant to cover only a boost in personal income tax rates 
while personal income taxes provide the bulk of the governments 
revenues large sums of money are also raised by a variety of other 
taxes from gasoline levies to taxes on cigarettes and alcohol and 
from fees charged for government services 
politicians who dont like to talk about raising taxes sometimes 
say they would accept revenue enhancers 
bush was asked whether he would also categorically rule out 
revenue enhancements of any kind as a way of reducing the 
federal budget deficit 
he essentially sidestepped the question saying he would need a 
definition of a revenue enhancement before he could answer 
while bush was dancing around the t word wednesday talk of 
higher taxes filled the air in washington 
senate republican leader bob dole suggested stripping away the 
tax deductions businesses now enjoy when they use borrowed money in 
corporate buyouts dole said the huge corporate takeovers do not 
benefit the economy he said the tax deductions on buyout loans were 
loopholes in the tax code which should be closed 
former federal reserve chairman paul volcker told a conference 
sponsored by the american stock exchange that it will be politically 
impossible to balance the budget without tax increases volcker said 
he believed income tax rates could remain unchanged but he suggested 
boosting the gasoline tax by 60 cents a gallon over the next four 
years and hiking taxes on alcohol and tobacco 
the national economic commission the highlevel advisory panel 
created by congress to come up with solutions to the deficit 
problem announced a daylong hearing next wendesday to launch its 
postelection effort at coming up with a combination of spending 
cuts and tax increases acceptable to the white house and congress 
one of the leadoff witnesses will be federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan who has already gone on record in favor of increasing 
gasoline taxes 
officials of the commission said they are awaiting word from the 
bush transition team on the names of the two individuals the 
presidentelect will appoint to the panel many expect those 
appointments will tell a lot about bushs intentions on grappling 
with the budget problem 
in his meeting with reporters bush noted that he had been 
attacked during the campaign for supporting higher taxes because of 
his endorsement of the catastrophic illness insurance legislation 
passed this year by congress 
as he did during the campaign bush insisted that the measure was 
not a tax increase even though the new law hikes the monthly 
medicare insurance fee paid by social security beneficiaries and 
imposes an incometax surcharge on wealthier retirees to pay for the 
expanded health benefits 
im talking about holding the line on taxes and i dont plan 
to deviate and i think the american people must have understood 
that when they voted in rather large numbers for my candidacy 
bush said 
still some private economists said they believed bushs vague 
answer on revenue enhancers signalled a shifting position 
eventually bush is going to have to back off of his 
commitment said lawrence chimerine president of the wefa group 
an economic forecasting firm in bala cynwyd pa 
the deficit problem has not been resolved and there are 
enormous pressures building for increased spending to fight the 
drug problem and bail out hundreds of insolvent savings and loan 
institutions chimerine said 
after dropping sharply in 1987 the budget deficit began rising 
again in the justcompleted fiscal year climbing to 1551 billion 
with many economists predicting it could climb above 160 billion 
this year

c fred bergsten director of the institute for international 
economics in washington said foreigner investors could lose 
confidence unless bush acts quickly to get the federal deficit under 
control foreigners have grown in importance for the more than 100 
billion a year they lend the us economy 
a panic by foreign investors could send the dollar into a 
tailspin pushing up interest rates in this country and toppling the 
us economy into a recession bergsten warned in a new book 
published today america in the world economy 
without strong efforts to balance the budget bergsten forecast 
there would be a sharp fall in the dollar as much as 20 percent 
to 25 percent inflation doubledigit interest rates recession 
he added that foreigners probably would not wait much beyond the 
first two months of the new administration to see action 
by easter march 26 well be well on a good road or in the 
soup he said 
</TEXT>

harvard economist martin feldstein one of bushs economic 
advisers also voiced concern wednesday about the willingness of 
foreigners to continue financing us deficits without significant 
progress on the budget deficit 
but unlike many economists feldstein said he believed bushs 
plan for a flexible freeze on spending would be an effective way 
of reducing the budget deficit 
feldstein said the bush plan could reduce the budget gap to 1 
percent of the overall economy as measured by the gross national 
product in four years down from more than 3 percent currently

lower oil and textile imports in october helped 
boost japans trade surplus to 769 billion in october up 1309 
percent over a year earlier but slightly lower than in september 
the finance ministry said thursday 
but japans trade surplus with the united states fell for the 
10th straight month from yearearlier levels to 483 billion in 
october down 31 percent from 498 billion in the previous year 
but up from 465 billion in september 
exports to the united states rose 79 percent from a year earlier 
to 834 billion while imports from the united states climbed 277 
percent to 351 billion the ministry said 
officials noted major increases in usbound exports of 
semiconductors and passenger vehicles japans exports of 
semiconductors to the united states jumped 547 percent to 314 
million while vehicle exports grew 9 percent to 247 billion 
japans total 769 billion trade surplus in october compared 
with 68 billion in october 1987 and 774 billion this past 
september in august japans trade surplus was 494 billion 
japans exports during october rose 132 percent from a year 
earlier to 2338 billion from 2066 billion and imports also 
climbed 132 percent to 157 billion 
after rising for 15 months from yearearlier levels the nations 
trade surplus reversed direction in july this trend raised concern 
among officials that the surge could aggravate trade friction 
finance ministry officials said weaker imports from southeast 
asia and lower crude oil prices were the main reasons for the 
fastergrowing trade surplus crude oil prices averaged 1192 per 
barrel in october down 33 percent from a year earlier 
japanese customers bought less crude oil in the expectation that 
a meeting of the organization of petroleum exporting countries could 
further reduce global oil prices the officials said speaking 
anonymously crude oil imports fell 41 percent to 117 billion in 
october 
lower textile products from southeast asia boosted japans 
surplus with the region to 181 billion more than twice the 
yearearlier level 
octobers trade surplus exceeded the levels expected by local 
analysts and dealers in financial markets 
exports in october were figured at an average exchange rate of 
13204 yen to the dollar compared to 14450 yen a year earlier 
imports were pegged at 13258 yen versus 14459 yen 
japan measures its trade surplus on a customsclearance basis 
which includes freight and insurance costs on imports but not for 
exports its trade surplus would be higher if those costs were 
included in both categories

wholesale prices remained flat in october after 
seven straight monthly increases as the cost of food fell for the 
first time since february the government said today 
analysts said the stability in the labor departments producer 
price index for the first time in eight months signifies a tapering 
off of the effects of the summer drought which had sent food prices 
up 35 percent since may 
wholesale food prices led by large declines for fruits 
vegetables bakery products pasta beef and cooking oils fell 01 
percent last month that was their first decline since february the 
labor department said 
food prices had skyrocketed 12 percent in september 
seasonally adjusted energy prices rose by 03 percent last month 
after falling by 33 percent in september following sharp declines 
over the summer natural gas rates jumped 46 percent last month 
while gasoline prices held steady and home heating oil prices fell 
101 percent 
wholesale prices for goods other than food and energy were 
unchanged last month automobile home appliance drug and 
childrens apparel prices fell prices rose for womens and mens 
clothing household furniture cosmetics alcoholic beverages and 
prescription drugs 
before seasonal adjustments the labor departments index for 
goods one step short of the retail level rose 06 percent to 1093 
meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing 100 at the 
wholesale level in 1982 would have cost 10930 last month 
that same marketbasket of goods would have cost 10860 in 
september and 10770 a year ago 
the seasonal adjustment process is designed to remove 
predictable periodic influences from the calculation of price 
changes 
analysts said the difference between the seasonally adjusted 
prices and real ones was primarily connected with the introduction 
of 1989model automobiles 
because auto rebates on 1988 models were smaller than normal 
in september price increases in october were less than seasonally 
expected said donald ratajczak head of economic forecasting at 
georgia state university in atlanta also price rebates began 
almost as soon as new vehicles reached dealers 
sticker prices on 1989 models were an average of 75 percent 
above what the 1988 models were selling for in september the labor 
department said 
but it put the value of quality changes such as 
governmentmandated passive restraints new corrosion protection and 
improvements in powertrains at 15369 per vehicle or 346 percent 
of the average 44408 increase in price to dealers 
including seasonal variations intended to spread the increase 
associated with new models across the year new car prices were 
calculated as falling 17 percent 
alcoholic beverage prices rose 06 percent on the wholesale level 
last month after declining by 03 percent in september womens and 
mens apparel costs were up 01 percent and 02 percent respectively 
while prices for childrens clothing fell 03 percent after rising 
06 percent in the backtoschool buying month of september 
prescription drug prices rose 04 percent and are now 93 percent 
above what they were a year ago cosmetics rose 05 percent on 
october but are only 29 percent higher than for the same month in 
1987 
household furniture prices rose 08 percent last month and are 
45 percent above what they were a year ago including a 05 percent 
decline last month wholesale prices for household appliances have 
risen only 07 percent in the last year 
overall wholesale prices for finished goods other than food and 
energy have risen 41 percent in the last 12 months slightly less 
than a 45 percent increase in consumer prices over the same period 
energy prices on the wholesale level have fallen 59 percent over 
the year while food prices have risen a total of 45 percent the 
labor department said in all wholesale prices are 29 percent 
above what they were in october 1987 
price declines of 92 percent for fruits 19 percent for 
vegetables 58 percent for pasta 09 percent for fish 40 percent 
for cooking oils and 16 percent for beef and pork paced the 01 
percent drop overall in wholesale food prices last month 
offsetting those large declines were increases of 19 percent for 
processed chickens 80 percent for turkeys 73 percent for eggs 
and 10 percent for canned fruits and vegetables 
ratajczak said the lower beef and pork prices reflect unusually 
large prefrost slaughters because of high feed grain costs 
prices for intermediate goods further back in the production 
chain items such as plastic parts cement paints fertilizers 
lumber and chemicals also were flat in october but are 53 percent 
higher than they were a year ago 
raw material prices for crude products such as oil agricultural 
commodities scrap aluminium iron ore and timber declined 01 
percent last month and are only 05 percent above what they were a 
year ago the department said

business can be better served with south african ownership robert 
price control datas chairman said wednesday 
control data which began operations in south africa in 1964 
will maintain a legal entity in south africa for continuing several 
education and community development initiatives funded by a 
permanent trust the company said 
control data withdrew only from owning a subsidiary in south 
africa not from doing business there control data will continue to 
sell computers and services to south african customers through 
unidev said frank ryan a control data spokesman 
the companys johannesburgbased subsidiary accounted for less 
than 1 percent of the companys 1987 revenue of 34 billion ryan 
said 
the companys business involvement with south africa had in 
recent years generated considerable criticism from church groups and 
some pension funds opposing south africas racially separate 
apartheid society 
groups that owned stock in the company used control datas annual 
stockholders meetings as a forum for their protests 
as a result of its continuing indirect presence in south africa 
the pressure on control data from antiapartheid groups may be eased 
but not stopped 
many church groups colleges and others who have joined the 
divestment movement as a means to end apartheid are demanding that 
companies not just sell their south african operations but that they 
cut ties altogether 
control data south africas 123 employees will be transferred to 
unidev under the terms of the agreement

gte corp is taking a muchneeded step as 
well as following a national trend by announcing it would trim 7000 
jobs some through layoffs in the next four years analysts said 
they definitely have too many people relative to other 
telephone companies geoff johnson a telecommunications analyst 
with argus research in new york said wednesday after the company 
announced the planned cuts 
its also part of a broader trend in the industry everyone 
has been trying to cut costs and reducing through attrition early 
retirement he said 
gte said the previously announced restructuring of its telephone 
operations would result in nearly 7000 personnel reductions by 1992 
the company said in a statement the reductions would come from 
staff functions that support local service operations total 
employment for gtes domestic telephone companies and associated 
headquarters staff is about 85000 and about 28000 of those people 
are in staff positions 
gte announced plans to streamline its telephone operations in 
march to continue improving service quality and to become faster 
more flexible and responsive to customer requirements 
the company said some of the reductions would come from early 
retirement offerings 
we expect as many as 2000 people may take advantage of this 
early retirement option said kent b foster group vice 
president of gte telephone operating group in addition we have 
had a virtual hiring freeze in place throughout most of this year 
so a number of alreadyvacant positions simply will go unfilled 
he said some employees would be reassigned to positions in other 
gte businesses 
some layoffs are inevitable however and will be used only as 
a last resort foster said the majority of these will come from 
our management ranks and will occur over time 
the company would not project the number that would be laid off 
johnson projected that gtes plan could save them about 93 
million a year for three years he said that savings does not 
include severance costs 
james l johnson chairman and chief executive officer said 
these reductions are expected to generate substantial annual cost 
savings which will be reflected over time in rate reductions to gte 
customers and in improved earnings for gte shareholders 
johnson also said that additional reductions unrelated to this 
restructuring would occur over the next five years as the company 
institutes changes brought about by new technologies 
gte had revenue of 154 billion in 1987 its three core 
businesses telecommunications lighting and precision materials 
employ about 161000 people in 44 states and 38 other countries

grain and soybean futures opened modestly lower 
today on the chicago board of trade in reaction to an increase in 
the agriculture departments cornproduction estimate 
in a report issued wednesday afternoon the usda raised its 
projection for the 1988 us corn harvest to 467 billion bushels 3 
percent above last months forecast but still the smallest corn crop 
since 1983 
soybean production was forecast at 151 billion bushels up 1 
percent from last months estimate but within the markets 
expectations 
the unexpectedly high corn estimate led to a weaker opening 
across the board but wheat quickly turned mixed in response to the 
usdas downward revision of its world wheat production estimate 
analysts said 
the world production report indicated argentinas and 
australias wheat crops would be smaller than projected last month 
and those are major competitors so thats positive for the wheat 
market said walter spilka a grain market analyst with smith 
barney harris upham amp co in new york 
in early trading wheat was cent lower to cent higher with 
the contract for delivery in december at 425 a bushel corn was 1 
cent to 2 cents lower with december at 276 a bushel december 
oats the only active contract in early trading were 3 cents lower 
at 220 a bushel soybeans were 2 cents to 4 cents lower with 
november at 792 a bushel 
cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mixed 
in early trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle 02 cent lower to 15 cent higher with december at 
7317 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent lower to 18 cent 
higher with november at 8115 cents a pound live hogs were 20 cent 
lower to 33 cent higher with december at 4075 cents a pound

the 44 billion super collider project involves building a 
53milelong racetrackshaped tunnel around which two beams of 
tiny particles would race in opposite directions the purpose is to 
create headon collisions 
from the crashes physicists hope to learn whether matter is made 
up of even smaller building blocks than those identified so far and 
learn more about the particles of matter and the forces that act on 
them 
the super collider would use some 10000 superconducting magnets 
to guide the two beams of particles called protons it is called a 
super collider because it would accelerate the protons until 
they packed some 20 times the punch or kinetic energy that 
existing machines can create 
at that energy level a proton would have only about as much 
kinetic energy as a mosquito in flight but a proton is extremely 
small a row of 100 billion protons would extend the width of a 
human hair so it packs its energy very densely and the high 
density is what physicists are looking for 
as the two beams of protons intersect in the super collider most 
would pass through unscathed but when a collision smashed a 
quark or a building block of one proton into the quark of 
another proton a huge amount of energy would be released 
the energy would turn into jets of tiny new particles some of 
which may never have been observed before 
the trajectories and other properties of the particles created in 
the collisions would then be studied for clues to the world of the 
very very small

when robert maxwell won a takeover battle for 
macmillan inc the flamboyant socialist tycoon silenced his 
doubters and took a giant step toward fulfilling his dream of 
creating a global communications empire 
the success of his 26 billion bid for the us publishing and 
information services giant after months of opposition was sweet 
vindication for the 65yearold british press baron 
although he had succeeded at smaller us acquisitions maxwell 
had failed in previous attempts to take over major american 
companies namely harcourt brace jovanovich inc and bell amp howell 
co 
these highly publicized failures over the past few years had 
caused some maxwellwatchers to question his goal of building 
maxwell communication corp into one of the worlds top 10 media 
companies 
under the circumstances maxwells public response to the 
macmillan victory was uncharacteristically subdued i didnt feel 
anything he said at a new york press conference last week its a 
major responsibility that falls on my shoulders 
maxwell who is motivated in part by a desire to compete with his 
archrival publisher rupert murdoch said he plans further 
acquisitions as he tries to reach his revenue target of about 5 
billion to 9 billion 
the combined 1987 revenue of maxwell communication of which he 
is chairman and macmillan is about 26 billion 
overcoming obstacles is nothing new to maxwell a large dashing 
man with sweptback black hair and bushy eyebrows over mischievous 
eyes 
maxwell who declined to be interviewed for this article was 
born labji hoch the son of lithuanian jewish peasants who were 
killed by the nazis during world war ii 
of his early life maxwell said in a recent interview on london 
television if you really want to know what it is like you would 
have to go to dickens as it was 
maxwell emigrated to britain as a teenager in 1940 and he says 
he arrived penniless clutching a rifle and speaking no english 
the selfeducated maxwell who went to primary school for only 
three years taught himself the language which he speaks with a 
distinctly upper class accent and in a booming voice and joined 
the british army 
he became a captain and a war hero winning the coveted military 
cross for bravery 
in one episode characteristic of his ruthlessness at war maxwell 
executed a german civilian the mayor of a town who had hoisted a 
white surrender flag to decoy maxwells troops into an ambush by the 
german army 
maxwells letter about it to his frenchborn wife said i had a 
very amusing day yesterday 
in the tv interview maxwell recalled the incident with regret 
attributing it to his temper i was 20 years of age and one treats 
the war as partially fun he added in explanation of the letter to 
his wife 
after the war maxwell turned his attention to business and 
politics he bought pergamon press a publisher of scientific 
journals in 1951 and launched a political career as a labor member 
of parliament 
while some point to a contradiction in his socialist politics and 
capitalist ambitions such questions havent kept maxwell from 
enjoying all the trappings of his wealth he lives in a mansion near 
oxford and comes and goes from his offices near fleet street in a 
helicopter he entertains on a yacht previously owned by the wealthy 
khashoggi family of saudi arabia and he owns one of britains 
firstdivision soccer teams 
maxwell says that when he was young his mother blamed his 
fathers and other mens joblessness on conservative politicians 
all over the world 
and i have ever since then never been able to support anything 
conservative maxwell said 
maxwells first really big business break came in 1981 when he 
bought the struggling british printing and communication corp 
britains largest commercial printer and turned it around 
today maxwell communication employs 17000 people and had net 
earnings of 235 million on revenue of 16 billion last year 
ironically maxwell said after the macmillan victory that he 
intends to sell the pivotal british commercial printing business and 
possibly other maxwell communication and macmillan assets to focus 
more on publishing 
in 1984 maxwell bought the mirror group newspapers which he 
holds privately winning control of a national newspaper which had 
been one of his many ambitions 
maxwells leftwing daily mirror is britains secondlargest 
daily with a circulation of 325 million it competes with the 
conservative sun the no 1 seller with circulation of 41 million 
the sun is published by murdoch at whom maxwell constantly jabs 
although his london daily news folded within months of its launch 
in late 1986 the undaunted maxwell earlier this year announced 
plans to publish a newspaper called the european that would cover 
the continent maxwell expects the paper to debut in the spring and 
attract 600000 readers 
he says he has been motivated through the years by a desire to 
make a small contribution to halting the retreat of these islands 
which has gone on for so long that the natives have forgotten that 
they are walking backwards 
to say that maxwell is patriotic is an understatement 
britain became my home virtually from the day i landed here 
and i shall die here he said 
although maxwell loves britain not all of britain loves maxwell 
what puts many britons teeth on edge is his reputation for being a 
pushy selfpromoter maxwell who has been dubbed captain bob by 
the british press is often pictured in newspapers frequently 
wearing a cap 
maxwell lore has it that this selfmade man long has yearned for 
acceptance which he denies 
im in the information and communications business and the 
media inevitably that carries with it the high profile you 
mentioned maxwell said in the tv interview i dont want 
admiration 
maxwell says his biggest achievement is not businessrelated 
noting that he and his wife have been married 44 years and have 
seven children some of whom work in the business maxwell said i 
hope the major achievement youll accept is really the family

as the future leader of the worlds largest economy 
presidentelect george bush is making the adjustment from a seeker 
of peoples votes to a weigher of their demands 
bushs biggest job from now until his inauguration is to plan an 
agenda for business and the economy that balances the competing 
needs and desires of all the american people it wont be easy 
the associated press conducted interviews on the morning after 
the election with 13 americans in business and they predictably 
disagreed on their advice to bush 
the interviewees ranged from the heads of atampt and the uaw to the 
leader of a bailedout texas thrift a cookie millionaire a weight

the president faces no challenge more important than keeping the 
economy strong he has to make sure the economic expansion continues 
at a steady pace and work toward holding down inflationary pressures 
and interest rates 
he should take steps to encourage increased savings and 
investment in the united states we have a 4 percent savings rate 
japan has a 17 percent rate savings is the key to stimulating 
innovation in the economy and creating jobs 
as the baby boom population approaches retirement the strains on 
the social security system will be unbelievable we need tax 
incentives to encourage savings and investment

id like to see us compete in the world markets with our 
agricultural products we havent been able to do that until the 
last few years we need to move products overseas and keep our 
production plants running 
we know were going to have to buy something from them if they 
buy from us i want to see third world countries developed in terms 
of buying our goods we have to have some way to move products 
we know the world needs that food so we have to figure out ways 
to get it out of the country and still make it profitable for our 
country

the president certainly has to deal with the deficit we cant 
continue to spend more than we make and in that sense our 
government isnt a heck of a lot different from a household you can 
carry a certain amount of debt but were getting to the point where 
we have more debt than we can comfortably carry and its likely to 
have a material effect on interest rates 
its terribly important that the administration understands that 
the financial services industry in texas is in collapse its not a 
problem its a collapse thats not going to get fixed with a 
bandaid we should bring some sound and solid nonpartisan thinking 
to this problem 
he should execute a national housing policy that will enable 
lenders to provide loans for home buying were making loans but 
were not doing it successfully

the next president should put a stop to the open hostility toward 
unions that weve had from the past administration and the current 
national labor relations board 
the nlrb under president reagan took very onesided antilabor 
positions that have crippled organizing drives and made it much more 
difficult for unions to represent members effectively congress 
intended the nlrb to be a neutral agency and the president should 
seek to restore that neutrality 
there also are a whole range of workplace issues like an 
increase in the minimum wage a requirement that everyone who works 
receives minimum health care benefits from their employers child 
care and parental leave packages and notification of potential 
health hazards for those working in a highrisk environment its 
shear baloney that this would interfere with competitiveness 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
basically the president has to make the assets of this country 
more productive and if we dont do that we will fast become a 
second or thirdrate power we have to make top management 
accountable 
if top management doesnt do the job remove them we need simple 
legislative changes like those that exist in england where if 
somebody wants to make an offer for a company they have to have the 
capital and a simple rule that if someone makes a credible bid for 
a company shareholders should be given the right to vote on that 
offer 
management can recommend they reject the offer but shareholders 
should decide we shouldnt have to fight with poison pills court 
cases scorchedearth policies once you have a certain amount of 
stock and make an offer for a company the shareholders vote 
in addition pension plans should not be controlled by the 
corporation managers of the funds feel beholden to the company 
what should be done is have a board of say retired judges people 
above reproach with no agenda who are allowed to appoint pension 
managers so if a manager votes shares in the pension plan against 
incumbent management in a takeover their job is not threatened 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the president has to recognize that women are a huge and 
permanent part of the work force they will outnumber men as 
workers in the next 20 years 
there must be policies that reconcile their responsibilities at 
work and at home like child care and equal pay for parttime work 
so that parttime jobs are not a way to reduce labor costs but a way 
to fit the genuine needs for both management and workers 
we need to increase the minimum wage at the very least the 
minimum wage currently pays less than the poverty level for a 
working couple you will not build a strong work force that can 
improve its productivity on that basis 
in addition compared with our competitors the us has the 
lowest rate of literacy and its the only industrialized nation 
that doesnt have a family leave policy we also need minimum health 
insurance because so many workers are not covered by health care

energy secretary john herrington today 
announced the selection of texas as the site for the highly prized 
44 billion super collider atom smasher if the giant research 
installation is ever built 
seven states had vied for the project because of the economic 
benefits tied to the construction of the collider a 53mile 
underground ring of 10000 magnets capable of whipping proton beams 
together with 20 times the force of the worlds most powerful 
existing particle accelerator 
herrington said the texas site some 16000 farm acres in ellis 
county south of dallas was superior to the others 
the decision he said was based in part on site geology 
regional resources and environmental criteria 
the texas proposal clearly received the highest overall 
technical evaluation ratings of any proposal and exhibited no 
significant overall weaknesses herrington said 
the six other contenders were illinois arizona colorado 
michigan north carolina and tennessee they were chosen from a 
field of 25 bidding states by an independent panel appointed by the 
energy department 
officials of some of the losing states however linked texas 
selection to tuesdays election of george bush who lives in texas 
as president the department of energy made a decision based on 
politics rather than on merit and the good of the american 
taxpayer said sen alan dixon dill i do not believe that the 
timing of this decision and its proximity to the election is a 
coincidence 
sen donald riegle dmich said the decision has a strong 
smell of white house politics that was our major concern all along 
we and the other five finalist states got a raw deal 
but herrington told reporters the selection was made purely on 
technical merits and added i have to tell you there are no 
politics in this 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas and the unsuccessful democratic vice 
presidential candidate said todays announcement made this a 
wonderful day for our country and out state 
he pledged as chairman of the senate finance committee to do 
everything in my power to guarantee that the funds for 
construction are appropriated on time i am happy to have had a 
hand in bringing it about 
the energy department must now prepare a fullfledged 
environmental statement assuming nothing in the statement 
disqualifies the texas site herrington will make its selection 
final in january 
congress has not yet appropriated money to build the collider 
but did provide 100 million in the current fiscal year for 
engineering design and certain research and development items in 
all congress has appropriated only 205 million for the collider 
herrington said the facility if it is built will be named the 
ronald reagan center for high energy physics because reagan is 
the president who had the vision to move forward with the 
outstanding scientific project of this century 
texas sen phil gramm who announced his states selection 
earlier in the day called the collider the most important 
scientific project that will be built anywhere in the world in the 
last quarter of the 20th century 
the project is viewed as a plum for its host state because of the 
economic benefits it will provide thousands of construction jobs 
permanent employment for as many as 3000 people and an annual 
budget of 270 million 
the contending states spent years and millions of dollars trying 
to persuade the energy department to put the project on their turf 
lobbying continued right up to the last minute 
in an effort to attract the project texas voters approved a 11 
billion bond package that would reduce the federal cost of building 
the atom smasher south of dallas 
the concept behind accelerators is not new eo lawrence won a 
nobel prize for inventing the cyclotron in the early 1930s 
the texas project will be the most powerful accelerator ever 
built taking advantage of the discovery that at close to absolute 
zero or minus450 degrees fahrenheit certain materials lose all 
electrical resistance the loss of resistance is called 
superconductivity 
in the waxahachie accelerator protons will travel toward each 
other from opposite ends of the machine and will collide at speeds 
up to 20 times those produced by the fastest existing accelerator 
outside chicago 
when the protons collide they will break into smaller particles 
called quarks whose paths and behavior will be monitored closely as 
scientists explore the tiniest yetdiscovered building blocks of the 
universe and the laws that determine their arrangement

boosted in part by the drop in oil and 
natural gas prices the texas petrochemical industry is booming 
again 
texas plants are operating at full capacity along the gulf coast 
and are announcing expansions because theyre running out of room to 
produce ethylene and other basic petrochemicals 
the resurgence of the business comes at a time when the texas 
economy is feeling the pinch of lower crude oil prices but like 
other downstream refining and processing operations 
petrochemicals are benefiting from lower prices for raw materials 
petrochemicals are derivatives of crude that are used in a wide 
range of consumer and industrial products the list goes on and on 
plastic bags automobile springs water pipes computer chips 
paints medicines carpets clothes shoes luggage furniture heat 
shields for rockets even diapers made of polypropylene 
in my opinion its the bright star in the texas economy 
said state comptroller bob bullock 
the houston economic development council says 70 plant expansions 
valued at a total of 4 billion have been announced for completion 
by 1991 from corpus christi to louisiana a 250mile stretch of 
coastline that supplies twothirds of the nations major 
petrochemicals 
some of the biggest include a 600 million dow usa ethylene plant 
at freeport texas and three quantum chemical corp ethylene and 
polyethylene projects worth 400 million in houston 
the council said the proposed formosa plastic corp usa plant at 
point comfort texas a 3 billion complex is scheduled for 
completion by 1993 the project would create 1500 jobs and have an 
annual payroll of 85 million 
analysts estimate that in socalled bulk chemicals such as 
ethylene a 1 million investment equals only one new job but even 
so the petrochemical industry pumped more than 2 billion in 
wages and salaries into the texas economy in 1987 according to 
the state comptrollers office 
dr charles holland professor emeritus at texas aampm university 
and president of the texas institute for advancement of chemical 
technology called texas the hightech chemical center of the 
world 
the initial petrochemical boom came with the need for synthetic 
rubber and antiknock gasoline in world war ii it grew until the 
1970s when the arab oil embargo and worldwide overcapacity set it 
back 
the industry retrenched again during the 198182 recession when 
the oil companies cut costs closed plants and laid off workers 
in addition to lower crude prices a decline in the value of the 
dollar has contributed to the industrys recent recovery senior 
economist thomas plaut of the comptrollers economic analysis center 
said the dollars 30 to 40 percent drop from the middle of 1985 to 
the beginning of 1987 helped revive the export business by making 
us petrochemical products more competitive in world markets 
out of something bad comes something good observed bullock 
noting how when oil prices are down petrochemicals pick up 
petrochemical exports from texas in 1984 totaled 39 billion 35 
percent of the value of all manufacturing exports from the state 
plaut says 
texas had 45749 jobs in petrochemicals in the first quarter of 
1988 up 1081 jobs or 24 percent over the same period last year 
the comptroller said 
another 30000 texans were employed in petrochemicalrelated jobs 
according to holland of aampm the texas chemical industry and its 
associated consumer product industries support 11 percent of the 
nations gross national product 
the chemical engineering professor believes the chemical industry 
not computers electronics or space may be the best bet for 
texas economic future 
however holland says the public perception of all chemicals as 
bottles of fuming smelly liquids or poisonous gases must be 
changed 
in times past he said the industrys position on risks 
was not to say much let the public relations guy handle it now 
the industry is much more publicconscious minded and feels it is 
better to tell all 
holland says continued petrochemical growth is expected 
throughout the 1990s with a 65 percent increase in production over 
1982 recession levels by 1995 
the value of an 18 barrel of crude oil increases to 21 when 
converted in texas to gasoline and 54 when converted to chemicals 
he said the figure ranges from 840 to 2700 per barrel when the 
potential value of consumer products made with chemicals is 
estimated 
developing its own consumer product industry constitutes one of 
texas greatest opportunities holland said those industries 
would not have to be located near the chemical complexes but could 
be inland in any part of the state 
such industries might produce furniture wall coverings 
textiles bottles or paints 
everything that you lay your eyes on in a modern building came 
out of a chemical plant or was touched by chemicals said holland

a state judge today left intact the poison 
pill defense that pillsbury co is using to try to thwart a 523 
billion takeover bid by the british conglomerate grand metropolitan 
plc 
but in denying a request from pillsbury shareholders that the 
food companys board be forced to drop the pill hennepin county 
district judge thomas carey urged negotiations between pillsbury and 
its suitor 
the pillsbury board must be left to do its own work but it 
seems to this court that direct negotiations may be justified he 
said 
carey said there were no legal issues that would prevent 
pillsbury the minneapolisbased food and restaurant company from 
negotiating the 60ashare offer from grand met 
the british firm also has asked that the pill which allows 
shareholders to buy pillsbury stock at a steep discount and raises 
the cost of a hostile takeover be removed so shareholders can 
consider its offer 
but on monday retired justice william duffy of the delaware 
chancery court denied grand mets motion to suppress the pill he 
ruled that as of oct 17 pillsburys directors had not abdicated 
their responsibility to shareholders in rejecting grand mets offer 
pillsbury announced monday it was spinning off its burger king 
restaurant division to stockholders and grand met responded by 
renewing its motion before the delaware court 
on wednesday duffy denied grand mets request for a rehearing 
but said he could still consider scheduling another hearing on the 
issue if grand met files new evidence 
the poison pill would allow pillsbury to issue new stock that 
grand met would have to acquire to take control of the company the 
cost of a takeover would rise to about 20 billion 
analysts differed on whether the poison pill could stymie grand 
mets takeover offer 
the poison pill is a significant deterrent to closing the 
transaction said allen finkelson of cravath swaine amp moore 
grand mets new york law firm 
but craig carver of the investment firm dain bosworth inc said 
pillsburys poison pill defense was a small bargaining chip 
i would not anticipate that would hold much water given the 
fact that 75 percent of the shares have been tendered anyway he 
said frankly i would anticipate the two companies to sit down 
and negotiate at the table 
on wednesday grand met said nearly 634 million shares or 743 
percent of pillsburys outstanding stock had been tendered under 
its offer 
the british firm also increased the pressure on pillsbury by 
extending its offer which had been scheduled to expire tuesday 
night until midnight nov 14 
analysts had speculated grand met would extend the offer to 
demonstrate to pillsbury a strong showing among shareholders who 
have agreed to sell their shares 
grand met had to say how many shares were tendered or offered 
for sale if it was to extend the buyout offer with the offer 
extended however shareholders could take back their shares until 
the next grand met deadline 
carver said i think grand met is continuing to apply 
pressure to pillsburys board grand met is obviously dealing from 
strength here 
i think the ball is back in pillsburys court he said 
carver said he expected the two companies will sit down and 
negotiate at the table

the government on thursday blocked elders ixl ltd 
from buying any more stock in the british brewer scottish and 
newcastle breweries plc 
the move came after the australianbased elders bought up 10 
percent of stock following a government decision to investigate its 
hostile bid for britains fifth largest brewer 
the government also blocked elders which now holds more than 24 
percent of scottish and newcastles shares from exercising the 
voting rights of more than 15 percent of scottish and newcastles 
stock 
trade secretary lord young dramatically stepped in and issued 
the orders under the fair trading act after elders confirmed it had 
sharply boosted its holding in scottish and newcastle by purchasing 
about 35 million shares in the market thursday 
elders made the purchases after young referred elders 16 
billionpound or 28 billion offer to the mergers and monopolies 
commission to determine its effect on competition 
elders bid of 400 pence a share automatically lapsed because 
of the referral 
scottish and newcastle shares fell 16 pence to finish at 390 
pence on londons stock exchange 
the target company complained with very grave concern about 
elders stock purchase saying such actions were prohibited under 
british takeover regulations 
elders appears to be attempting to preempt the outcome of the 
monopolies commission inquiry it said scottish and newcastle 
regard this situation as quite intolerable 
elders countered that it had not broken the rules 
there is a brief window between the recommendation and the mmc 
actually sitting and reviewing the matter it was during that window 
that we acquired the shares according to a spokesman for elders 
courage subsidiary who was not identified in accordance with 
british practice 
earlier young saying the bid raises questions of competition 
in the brewing wholesaling and retailing of beer asked the 
commission to report its findings within four months 
john elliott elders chairman and chief executive said he was 
shocked and disappointed by the investigation 
elders said the company would argue its case during the 
investigation in the hopes of being allowed to resume its bid 
elders already owns britains sixth largest brewer courage 
holdings ltd the acquisition of scottish and newcastle would give 
the combined group a 21 percent share of the countrys beer market 
a department of trade and industry spokesman said 
elders has argued that its takeover of scottish and newcastle 
would increase competition in the brewing industry by presenting a 
more formidable rival to market leader bass plc which has about 22 
percent of the british market 
the commission also has been conducting a long investigation into 
the british system of tied public houses under which a brewer 
owns a chain of pubs and markets its own brands through them that 
report is due to be completed feb 3

texaco inc said thursday it signed a 
definitive agreement with saudi arabian oil co on their previously 
announced venture to jointly refine and market petroleum in the 
united states 
texaco will receive 812 million for a 50 percent interest in its 
refining assets and marketing system in 23 east and gulf coast 
states the oil company said it expects to enjoy an additional 1 
billion in cash benefits and savings resulting from the joint 
venture 
the agreement which was originally outlined in june provides 
saudi arabia the worlds biggest oil exporter with a secure outlet 
for its products while virtually guaranteeing texaco a steady stream 
of crude at market prices 
the joint venture will be known as star enterprises and will be 
headquartered in houston 
the company will operate three major texaco refineries in 
delaware city del convent la and port arthur texas it also 
will operate about 1450 owned and leased service stations and 
distribute products to more than 10000 stations it will employ 
5000 people and is expected to be in operation by dec 31 
the saudis will provide 75 percent of the star enterprises 
initial oil inventory the joint venture will retain the right to 
buy up to 600000 barrels of crude from the saudis each day at 
market prices 
at the signing of the agreement in london texaco president james 
kinnear called the joint venture one of several major steps we 
have taken to restructure texaco and to enhance shareholder value 
earlier this year texaco emerged from protection from its 
creditors under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code it has been 
selling off 5 billion in assets to offest the disastrous effects of 
prolonged litigation with pennzoil co which resulted in the 
bankruptcy court reorganization and a 3 billion payment to pennzoil 
the oil giant also survived a bitter power struggle with its 
largest shareholder financier carl icahn who attempted to acquire 
the company for about 14 billion 
observers have taken issue with the saudi venture on the grounds 
that it raises questions about increased foreign leverage over the 
us oil industry which has become increasingly reliant on imports 
the venture is believed to be the biggest of its kind between a 
foreign supplier and a domestic oil company in the downstream 
end of the business the process for changing crude into gasoline 
and other products 
the saudi government has hinted that saudi arabia is interested 
in forming more marketing joint ventures oil industry sources said 
the kingdom was interested in linking up with european companies

the most urgent problem facing the president regarding 
manufacturing is the twin deficits 
beyond that our concerns will unfold as the new congress 
attempts to put through a number of mandated benefits which are 
linked to the deficit like mandatory health insurance the 
parental leave issue the dualshop question and increased minimum 
wage 
thats pretty tough medicine to apply to a lot of companies 
trying to compete in the world marketplace the president has got to 
be alert to these heavy burdens on the competitive capabilities of 
companies and try to head off as many as possible in terms of the

being a mother of five and a businesswoman i see the most 
important issue as education its been weak in bushs campaign and 
he really has to take a strong look at it 
from kindergarten on we must start teaching our kids parenting 
human relations the peril of drugs history must be taught in 
better ways so our children have role models to grow up to we have 
bushes and dukakises who are young children now and if we dont 
take proper care of them how are they going to take care of 
themselves 
child care is very important and somebody has to supplement the 
cost of child care facilities and if we are to get the proper 
people into jobs we need to provide equal pay for women 
the president should take a mean hard look at the welfare 
system we are paying people and they are losing their self respect 
he has to find a way to give them jobs

of japanese products we hope its cured and not just in remission 
but in the access area they are not living up to their side of the

when government has sound economic policies and acts with fiscal 
sanity and allows the economy to grow in a noninflationary way i 
dont see any need for special favors for any industry segment 
whatsoever 
but were not there now and we cant be with the budget deficit 
if we are going to move forward into the next decade with the 
entrepreneurial renaissance that has captured the imagination of the 
world we have to defuse the ticking time bomb of federal debt 
the president should start by slowing the rate of government 
spending to match the rate of growth of the economy theres a 
crying need for strong presidential leadership with a far stronger 
use of the veto

ways we need to continue an open market 
encouragement of more companies building plants in this country

perhaps the most important test of the next presidents personal

investment nondefense rampd research and development and in the

correcting these deficits isnt a job for one man alone or one

gap inc on thursday reported its thirdquarter profit jumped 43 
percent from its severely depressed results of a year earlier 
meanwhile may department stores co said its earnings for the 
quarter increased nearly 50 percent in part because of gains from 
the sale of real estate and its loehmanns specialty store division 
gap reported net income of 266 million or 73 cents per share 
compared with 186 million or 52 cents per share in the same 
period last year 
thirdquarter revenue totaled 3228 million up from the 2736 
million reported for the comparable period in 1987 
the results were a marked improvement over the dismal performance 
of thirdquarter 1987 when gap and other retailers began a 
yearlong sales slump that decimated their profits 
the retailers have shown signs of recovery in the latest quarter 
but industry analysts are warning their profits may look stronger 
than they really are because of the comparison with last years weak 
showing 
gap operates 887 stores including 705 gap 108 banana republic 
66 gapkids and eight hemisphere outlets 
may reported net earnings of 133 million or 91 cents a share

bankers who lend money for housing urged 
presidentelect george bush on thursday to take early steps against 
rising home mortgage rates and said they favor a broadbased tax 
increase if necessary to ease the deficit and save the housing 
market 
we hope that the bush administration as a last resort 
will not foreclose the option of raising new revenues if necessary 
to bring down the deficit said warren lasko executive vice 
president of the mortgage bankers association 
he has to find a way to step away from his readmylips 
philosophy said lasko referring to bushs campaign pledge not to 
raise taxes 
but lasko told a news conference that housing lenders would 
oppose any effort by the administration or congress to eliminate or 
reduce the income tax deduction home buyers can take on their 
mortgage interest he said such a move would be a tax increase 
lasko said the association which represents 2800 mortgage 
companies and other lenders hopes bush will give increased 
attention to housing in line with his promise for a kinder 
gentler nation 
he said the new president and congress will have an opportunity 
to weave a stronger thread of home ownership and housing opportunity 
into the social fabric of the nation 
the association says home ownership is declining in relation to 
the population with eight percent fewer families headed by men and 
women between the ages of 30 and 34 owning homes now than did when 
reagan was first elected in 1980 
it also says home buying takes a bigger bite out of family 
income rents are higher lowincome housing is scarcer vacancies 
are higher among highincome units and 95 million american 
families live in substandard housing 
lasko criticized the department of housing and urban development 
under reagan for failing to work with congress or with state and 
local officials to combat the housing problem 
hud has been negligent in recent years in not attending to the 
fact that housing and community building are to be carried out with 
governors and mayors he said 
lasko noted that interest rates on home mortgages have been 
creeping up in the past week and said they could reach 11 percent by 
the end of the year further slowing housing markets 
increases in the amount of public and private debt tend to push 
interest rates up and lasko said the united states has become a 
nation addicted to debt 
he said bushs first priority for benefitting housing should be 
to decrease the deficit nothing affects housing affordability 
more than interest rates he said

texas beat out six other states thursday in a 
highstakes race to capture the 44 billion superconducting super 
collider which if congress finds the money to build it would be 
the largest scientific instrument ever constructed 
the announcement by energy department secretary john herrington 
drew immediate howls of protest from losing states where officials 
had waged a yearslong battle to win the giant atomsmasher and the 
jobs and scientific prestige that will accrue to the projects home 
state 
the texas decision has a strong smell of white house 
politics said sen donald riegle dmich we and the other five 
finalist states got a raw deal 
illinois officials also were angered with house minority leader 
robert michel calling on the president to review herringtons 
decision declaring texas the preferred site for what the department 
will name the ronald reagan center for high energy physics 
eight senators alan dixon and paul simon of illinois riegle 
and carl levin of michigan dennis deconcini and john mccain of 
arizona and tim wirth and william armstrong of colorado asked 
reagan to establish a bipartisan commission of physicists that would 
review all seven of the finalist sites the others sites are in 
north carolina and tennessee 
the senators said if the project is to have the slightest 
chance of being funded the president must demonstrate the texas 
decision was based solely on scientific criteria utilizing a fair 
open and competitive bidding process 
sen jim sasser dtenn said his state should be proud of its 
efforts 
herrington said the texas site some 16000 farm acres in ellis 
county 35 miles south of dallas was superior to the others for 
building the collider a 53mile underground tunnel capable of 
whipping proton beams into each other with 20 times the force of the 
worlds most powerful existing particle accelerator 
the texas proposal clearly received the highest overall 
technical evaluation ratings of any proposal and exhibited no 
significant overall weaknesses herrington said 
herrington said the texas site would best permit the highest 
level of research productivity and effectiveness at a reasonable 
cost of construction and with minimal impact on the environment 
i have to tell you there are no politics in this herrington 
told a news conference attended by such prominent texans as house 
speaker jim wright and sen lloyd bentsen both democrats and sen 
phil gramm a republican 
the decision was announced two days after bush an adopted texan 
was elected president 
questions remain whether money ever will be appropriated to build 
the super collider an unprecedently powerful machine that 
physicists hope will help them explain the very origin of matter 
itself 
many in congress argue the project will starve other more useful 
scientific research congress has kept the project on a short leash 
and only agreed to provide 100 million this year for research and 
engineering design none of that may be used for construction 
nonetheless states eagerly sought the projects which is 
expected to create 3000 scientific jobs and 3500 construction 
jobs great prestige and a nonpolluting industry with untold 
scientific spinoffs for the host state 
herrington said the collider is absolutely necessary to keep 
scientific leadership in the united states 
most of the leadership in highenergy physics is headed for 
europe he said we need to keep those people in the united 
states 
the collider will put texas on the cutting edge of highenergy 
physics bentsen said he pledged as chairman of the senate 
finance committee to do everything in my power to guarantee that 
the funds for construction are appropriated on time 
the department now must prepare a fullfledged environmental 
impact statement assuming nothing in the statement disqualifies the 
texas site herrington will make the selection final in january 
the departments site selection task force did not compare the 
sites but found that the texas site was the only one rated 
outstanding on the four most important criteria 
those were geology and the ease of tunneling regional resources 
such as schools and access to airports environmental problems and 
site problems such as acquisition of real estate 
on the other two important criteria site conditions such as 
vibration and utility service texas was rated good one notch below 
outstanding 
tennessee had three outstanding ratings but was rated only 
satisfactory below good on regional resources colorado 
illinois and michigan had two outstanding ratings each 
texas was about in the middle of estimated costs of building the 
collider and operating it for 25 years the department estimated the 
total at 108 billion in 1988 dollars for texas possibly as low as 
104 billion for illinois and as much as 115 billion for arizona 
and michigan with the others somewhere in between 
dixon an illinois democrat charged the administration was using 
the super collider as a political tool 
the department of energy made a decision based on politics 
rather than on merit and the good of the american taxpayer dixon 
said i do not believe that the timing of this decision and its 
proximity to the election is a coincidence 
herrington said all states had asked that the selection be 
delayed until after the election and that the department was 
confident that any examination of the decision would show that it 
was not politically biased 
the report of the departments site task force rated illinois 
poor on real estate factors the only such ranking given the 
report noted strong landowner opposition in the area and limited 
land acquisition expertise by state authorities 
herrington said the facility will be named after reagan because 
he is the president who had the vision to move forward with the 
outstanding scientific project of this century

copper futures prices plummeted thursday on reports that the 
southern peru copper co had reached a labor agreement with its 
white collar and clerical workers and was nearing settlement of a 
3weekold miners strike 
on other markets precious metals prices also fell sharply 
soybean futures plunged while grains finished lower livestock meat 
and energy futures were mixed and stockindex futures advanced 
the spot copper price on new yorks commodity exchange fell 875 
cents the steepest oneday decline in the comex spot copper 
contract since feb 1 to 14325 a pound more than 10 cents below 
the record high of 1538 established on nov 2 
the most active contract for delivery in december tumbled 885 
cents to 13675 a pound 
the selloff was prompted by a midday report that southern peru 
copper the biggest coppermining firm in the worlds sixthlargest 
copperproducing country had come to terms with striking clerical 
and whitecollar employees analysts said 
the companys miners remained on strike but company officials 
reportedly said they may reach an agreement with them by monday the 
workers have been on strike since oct 18 
earlier in the day southern peru declared force majeure on 
shipments of 3000 metric tons of copper to european customers 
meaning it would be unable to honor those commitments and said 
shipments of another 4000 metric tons would be delayed 
but the copper market failed to rally on that ostensibly bullish 
news 
the strike has been a major factor in the copper markets surge 
to record highs and while worldwide supplies are expected to remain 
tight well into next year the markets behavior may indicate that 
the dramatic rally has peaked analysts said 
whether theyre moving close to a settlement or not this 
raises a flag has the top been put in or not said craig sloane 
a metals market analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co in new 
york 
today feels more like weve topped than any other day weve 
had he said this is how the market acts when its at the top 
preciousmetals futures prices also fell sharply partly on 
profittaking ahead of the veterans day bank holiday on friday and 
partly in reaction to a rise in shortterm interest rates analysts 
said 
on the comex gold settled 410 to 450 lower with december at 
42050 a troy ounce silver was 137 cents to 146 cents lower with 
december at 644 a troy ounce 
soybean futures prices plunged on heavy selling near the close of 
trading on the chicago board of trade dragging down wheat and oat 
prices and spurring further declines in an already weak corn market 
the collapse apparently was triggered by a massive sell order 
from the iowa grain co a large commodities brokerage firm that had 
purchased about 5 million bushels of soybeans early in the session 
and sold them all back shortly before the close analysts said 
the corn market had been weak all day in response to a slight 
increase in the agriculture departments estimate for 1988 us corn 
production 
wheat settled 1 cent lower to cent higher with the contract for 
delivery in december at 424 a bushel corn was 1 cent to 5 cents 
lower with december at 274 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 7 
cents lower with december at 215 a bushel and soybeans were 13

the market turned in a mixed performance thursday

shortterm the market is trying to find its footing 
analysts said the problems that plagued the market before

deficits returned to prey on investor confidence those concerns 
kept institutional investors on the sidelines 
theyre concerned that they have lots of cash but theyre 
uncertain of the markets direction given the changing of regimes

ian burton of the institute for advanced studies in toronto 
canada advocated ecological equity in which the industrialized 
nations chiefly responsible for polluting the atmosphere would cut 
back more than third world countries on emissions that harm the 
ozone layer 
equity was one of several philosophical issues raised at the 
conference 
the hamburg manifesto does not point fingers at those responsible 
for the pollution or say who should clean up 
it concentrates instead on measures that would slow the melting 
of polar ice caps and destruction of the ozone layer which some 
predictions say will occur by the middle of the next century 
hansjuergen karpe chairman of the drafting committee said the 
conference would reassemble in two years to evaluate how well the 
recommendations had been followed he is a professor at the 
university of dortmunds institute for environmental protection 
in its first draft the manifesto did not set pollution limits or 
specific objectives for reducing harmful emissions that cause the 
greenhouse effect 
under pressure from third world representatives and environmental 
groups conference organizers inserted words specifying the aim of 
reducing cardon dioxide emissions 30 percent by the year 2000 and 50 
percent by 2015 
third world delegates represented about 10 percent of the 
participants when they sent the organizers a message saying they 
still were dissatisfied with the document karpe said another 
version addressing their concerns would be issued later 
a report last month by the us environmental protection agency 
echoed other warnings that average temperature would rise as much as 
four degrees in the next 50 or 60 years 
atmosphere specialists say such a rise would be enough to parch 
existing farm belts cutting crop yields by up to 25 percent water 
and energy shortages also are forecast along with more frequent

bond prices rose slightly thursday on 
speculation that central banks in europe would help prop up the 
dollar 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond rose point or 125 for 
every 1000 in face value its yield which moves in the opposite 
direction and is an indicator of interest rates fell to 898 
percent 
bonds received relatively little support from a labor department 
report that wholesale price inflation slowed to zero last month 
traders said 
low inflation preserves the value of fixedincome securities and 
a report of flat prices usually buoys the bond market but after a 
brief uptick following the morning report prices fell back 
traders said the treasury bond market had trouble absorbing 
primary dealers sales of three and 10year notes that they had 
bought at auction earlier in the week 
the rumor that helped the bond market was that the bank of japan 
would ask european central banks to join it and the federal reserve 
in supporting the value of the dollar according to joseph plocek 
chief economist of mccarthy crisanti amp maffei inc 
the one item that will be required to turn dollar psychology 
around is coordinated intervention plocek said prospects of a 
declining dollar cause investors to flee from dollardenominated 
securities 
despite the rumor the dollar finished the trading day unchanged 
against the japanese yen and slightly lower against other major 
currencies 
plocek said bonds were also helped somewhat by cuts in shortterm 
interest rates by the japanese and west german central banks 
in the secondary market for existing treasury bonds prices of 
shortterm government issues slipped 132 to 116 point 
intermediate maturities were unchanged and 20year issues rose 316 
point according to figures provided by telerate inc a financial 
information service 
the movement of a point equals a change of 10 in the price of a 
bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer rose 012 to 114421 
corporate bonds also rose moodys investment grade corporate

foreign investors wielding burgeoning 
influence over the us economy will give presidentelect george 
bush two months at most to get a grip on the troublesome federal 
budget deficit a washington research institute warned thurday 
meanwhile the administration unhappily projected the fiscal 1990 
deficit at 132 billion up 21 billion from its forecast just three 
months ago when bush was nominated and 32 billion over the legal 
limit allowed without new taxes 
the institute of international economics echoing concerns by 
private economists and us business leaders said that without 
quick action by the bush administration to reduce the budget 
deficit the country could face a financial crisis and possible 
recession as foreign investors pull out 
the precarious international economic and financial position of 
the united states represents the most serious threat to the 
countrys continued economic expansion and financial stability 
the institute said in its new book america in the world economy 
the united states is now forced to look abroad for more than 100 
billion in new foreign loans and investment each year the book 
noted 
if the new administration appears headed for further stalemate on 
the budget deficit foreigners might suddenly decide the united 
states was no longer a good investment opportunity said institute 
director c fred bergsten 
a panic by foreign investors could send the dollar into a 
tailspin and seriously threaten us wellbeing bergsten said he 
noted that that foreign investors fears have been cited as a 
primary cause for the black monday stockmarket plunge of 
october 1987 
without a concerted effort to get the budget under control 
bergsten forecast a sharp fall in the dollar as much as 20 
percent to 25 percent inflation doubledigit interest rates 
recession 
bergsten said foreigners are likely to turn pessimistic quickly 
if deficit reduction is not made a primary goal during the 
traditional honeymoon period when an administrations powers of 
political persuasion with congress are usually highest 
by easter march 26 well be well on a good road or in the 
soup said bergsten a former assistant treasury secretary for 
international finance during the carter administration 
the institute said that in addition to eliminating the federal 
budget deficit the new administration must step up efforts to 
encourage other major countries to buy more us exports and develop 
ways to improve americas competitiveness 
one primary worry with the budget deficit is that it has begun 
rising again after falling sharply in 1987 because of a onetime 
windfall in revenues from tax reform the deficit for the fiscal 
year which ended on sept 30 climbed to 1551 billion and many 
economists are predicting this years deficit could top 160 billion 
president reagan and the rest of the cabinet were presented with 
the glum news thursday that the estimated deficit for the 1990 
fiscal year which begins next oct 1 has climbed to 132 billion 
that is up from an estimate of 111 billion made by the 
administrations office of management and budget just three months 
ago 
since the grammrudman balancedbudget law sets a deficit target 
of 100 billion that means the administration will have to come up 
with 32 billion in spending cuts to meet the target or face the 
prospect of raising taxes 
omb spokeswoman barbara clay said that there was no intention in 
reagans last budget to propose a tax increase or cuts in social 
security 
we have some difficult choices ahead on where to cut 
spending she said 
omb director joseph wright stressed the need for quick review of 
this years budget submission in order to meet a jan 9 deadline for 
presenting it to congress white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said in briefing reporters on the cabinet meeting 
with estimates on future deficits rising many private economists 
convinced that bush will be forced to accept some type of tax 
increase despite his oftrepeated opposition to new taxes during the 
campaign 
they note the public demands for the government to do more in the 
fight against drugs and estimates topping 50 billion for the cost 
of bailing out hundreds of insolvent savings and loans institutions 
as examples of new spending pressures 
the deficit problem has not been resolved and there are 
enormous pressures building for increased spending said lawrence 
chimerine president of the wefa group a private forecasting firm 
in bala cynwyd pa eventually bush is going to have to back off 
of his commitment of no new taxes 
at his first press conference as presidentelect on wednesday 
bush gave some appearances of flexibility on the subject of what he 
would consider prohibited taxes 
he referred to a new surtax on highincome elderly enacted this 
year as a way of financing the new catastrophic healthcare program 
and said i dont think it was a tax increase 
he also refused to rule out categorically socalled revenue 
enhancements the euphemism politicians often use in referring to 
increased taxes bush said he would have to see a definition of what 
revenue enhancements were being considered before he could make a 
decision 
also giving economists hope for resolution of the problem are 
wide expectations that bush will name richard darman as the new head 
of the office of management and budget darman a longtime aide to 
former treasury secretary james a baker iii is considered a 
pragmatist who would seek to work with congress in crafting 
deficitcutting solutions 
bush must soon make known his two appointments to the national 
economic commission the highlevel advisory panel created by 
congress to come up with a blueprint for eliminating the budget 
deficit many believe those appointments will tell a lot about 
bushs intentions on grappling with the budget problem

gte corp handed its employees more 
unwelcome news thursday saying it expects to eliminate about 14000 
jobs in its domestic telephone operations over the next five years 
in addition to the 7000 jobs it announced wednesday it would 
eliminate as a result of streamlining gte said an equal number of 
positions would be lost as a result of factors unrelated to the 
streamlining program 
its really businessasusual occurrences as you become more 
proficient and learn to do things in better ways you have some 
downsizing said carole barns a spokeswoman for the 
stamfordbased corporation 
gte executives discussed the planned cutbacks during the 
companys biannual meeting with analysts at the corporations 
management development center in norwalk 
on the eve of the meeting the company had announced that 
restructuring of the telephone operations would reduce the size of 
the workforce to a total of about 78000 by 1992 in part through 
offering early retirement incentives 
gte said virtually all of those reductions would come from the 
ranks of the 28000 employees in staff and headquarters management 
positions 
the company had also said additional reductions would occur as a 
result of changes unrelated to restructuring mainly costcutting 
and new technologies but it did not indicate the size of that 
cutback until thursday 
the cutbacks will not be limited to staff positions as are the 
reductions that will result from restructuring barns said 
gte had announced plans in march to streamline its telephone 
operations to continue improving the quality of service and to 
become faster more flexible and responsive to customer requirements 
the streamlining involves the folding of seven gte operating 
companies into four units and shifting of the telephone business 
headquarters from stamford to a site in either california texas 
indiana or florida the site will be named later this month 
gte corp employs about 161000 people in 44 states and 38 
foreign countries it reported earnings of 313 million on sales of 
4 billion during the quarter that ended sept 30 after a 55 
million charge related to its reorganization

a federal judge said thursday he could rule by 
monday on some of the issues raised by lawsuits in farley incs 
attempted 14 billion hostile takeover of westpoint pepperell inc 
us district judge g ernest tidwell heard arguments from 
attorneys for pepperell which has asked the court to block farleys 
48 a share tender offer as illegal and for farley which wants 
georgias new antitakeover law declared unconstitutional 
pepperell claims the offer by farley which controls 98 percent 
of pepperells stock includes too much debt and not enough equity 
in violation of federal reserve margin regulations it also contends 
that by participating in the deal farleys financial adviser 
drexel burnham lambert inc is violating a standstill agreement it 
made earlier this year with pepperell 
pepperell has asked tidwell for a preliminary injunction blocking 
the offer 
farley claims georgias antitakeover law hinders interstate 
commerce via provisions allowing poison pill takeover defenses 
and others forcing a hostile suitor to purchase 90 percent of 
outstanding stock except in certain instances 
pepperell became the nations largest publiclyowned textile 
company earlier this year after it acquired the bed and bath 
operations of jp stevens amp co inc 
the transaction forms the basis for much of pepperells attempt 
to block the tender offer by chicagobased farley whose 
subsidiaries include the manufacturer of fruit of the loom underwear 
pepperells claims involving drexel stem from the firms role as 
financial adviser to odyssey partners in its battle with pepperell 
over stevens 
the two sides eventually agreed to split stevens holdings between 
them during negotiations leading to that arrangement odyssey 
agreed not to share confidential information received as part of the 
bidding process and agreed not to try to acquire parts of stevens 
until after march 3 1989 
the agreement stipulated that any of odysseys advisers agree to 
the same restrictions before being given access to any of the 
information 
pepperell attorney bob thornton argued that drexel was bound by 
those requirements even though it did not sign the agreement 
drexel attorney larry silverman contended the agreement was 
dissolved by subsequent merger agreements between stevens and 
odyssey silverman also said drexel set up a chinese wall so 
none of the people involved in the stevens deal participate in the 
farley offer 
farley attorney steve greiner attacked georgias antitakeover 
statute which was passed this year the law is patterned after a 
delaware takeover statute that has been upheld but which has 
slightly different provisions 
it allows companies to adopt takeover defenses that make it 
prohibitively expensive to undertake a hostile buyout the law also 
says a suitor that does not acquire 90 percent of a target companys 
outstanding stock may not complete the takeover for five years
