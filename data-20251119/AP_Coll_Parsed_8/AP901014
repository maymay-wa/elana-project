leonard bernstein the impassioned american 
maestro who thrilled an international multitude with his spirited 
shows on the town and west side story his podium 
pirouettes and his hundreds of recordings died sunday he was 72 
bernstein was a conductor pianist educator author and 
composer his compositions included the theatrical chamber music 
symphonies ballet and even a mass 
he was the most versatile musician and he did more than any 
other person in this century for the appreciation of american music 
and music culture said sir georg solti music director of 
chicago symphony orchestra 
the son of russianjewish immigrants he led an orchestra 
performance at a liberated concentration camp raised money for the 
black panthers and on christmas 1989 celebrated the demise of the 
berlin wall by conducting beethovens ninth symphony 
substituting the word freedom for joy in its last movement 
the ode to joy 
he won grammys emmys and a tony but in november 1989 refused 
to accept the national medal of arts to protest cancellation of a 
10000 national endowment for the arts grant for a new york art 
exhibit about aids 
bernstein died in his manhattan apartment his spokeswoman 
margaret carson said dr kevin m cahill who was present said 
the cause of death was progressive lung failure 
on cahills advice bernstein announced through carson last week 
that he would retire from conducting cahill said emphysema and 
lung infections left bernstein too weak 
bernstein who was once a heavy smoker canceled performances 
with increasing frequency in recent months his last conducting 
appearance was at tanglewood mass on aug 19 
violist isaac stern paused after his 70th birthday tribute at 
the academy of music in philadelphia sunday night to remember his 
friend of 47 years 
we knew he was critically ill stern said he hoped 
against hope he would be given a little more time for himself and 
his activity with him goes a spectacular special era in american 
music making he was in a way the epitome of this burgeoning 
exultant young powerful giant called music making in this 
country 
the loss is too great to consider said choreographer jerome 
robbins his voice breaking ive lost a very good personal 
friend and collaborator from early on 
morton gould a composer conductor and president of the 
america society of composers authors and publishers said 
lenny had the magic touch almost anybody he conducted he 
popularized whatever he did he had such involvement and such 
dedication when lenny did mahler he was mahler he put mahler 
symphonies on the map 
john williams conductor of boston pops said his departure 
creates an unfillable gap in our artistic and spiritual life he 
leaves us at a moment when we seem to need him the most 
pianist jerome lowenthal who had played bernsteins age of 
anxiety with bernstein conducting said bernstein related to 
this music he was a very tortured man and you just had to have a 
word with him to know that and at the same time he managed to be 
embarrassingly charming his success just exacerbated the 
torture he suffered from the pressures of superstardom 
bernstein was a wiry young man of 25 with high cheekbones and 
dark wavy hair when he got his first major break on nov 14 
1943 he filled in at the last minute for an ailing bruno walter to 
conduct the new york philharmonic in a concert broadcast on 
national radio 
the triumph of the orchestras newly appointed assistant 
conductor was was big enough to join the world war ii headlines on 
the new york times front page 
his surprise appearance seemed to fulfill the prophecy of one of 
his friends who said lenny is doomed to success 
i walked on with an awful hangover and dont remember another 
thing until i heard a thunderous ovation bernstein recalled 
years later 
on the podium his jabs contortions and leaps occasionally 
caused him to fall he shagged shimmied and believe it or not 
bumped the late composercritic virgil thomson once said 
bernstein rose vertically a la nijinsky and hovered there a 
good 15 seconds new york times critic harold schonberg wrote 
but later on the occasion of bernsteins 1000th performance 
with the philharmonic on dec 15 1971 schonberg wrote at this 
time it is only right to put reservations aside and salute 
bernstein for what he did and even for what he tried to do 
bernstein was a figure that no conductor in history has matched 
bernstein maintained that conductors should be actors 
i dont mean that when the music is tragic youve got to act 
like barrymore in hamlet he once said but you have to 
indicate to the orchestra by your body and your face which is all 
youve got what the shape of the phrase is 
born in lawrence mass bernstein got a relatively late start 
in music the boy genius was 10 when his aunt clara gave the family 
an upright piano but he always had an ear for music recalled his 
mother jennie 
when he was 4 or 5 he would play an imaginary piano on his 
windowsill mrs bernstein said in joan peysers 1987 biography 
bernstein a biography when we finally got a piano he did 
what he now says he did made love to it all the time 
his father sam however hoped lenny would join his beauty 
supply business lenny persisted with piano he went on to study 
under walter piston at harvard fritz reiner at curtis institute 
and serge koussevitzky at the boston symphonys summer tanglewood 
retreat

israel on sunday rejected a un investigation 
into the shooting of 19 palestinians on the temple mount 
the decision came after a fourhour meeting of israels cabinet 
and was announced by foreign minister david levy 
on friday the un security council condemned israel and 
decided to send a team under secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar to investigate the slayings monday 
israeli troops fired live ammunition at palestinian protesters 
on the mount known in arabic as haram alsharif or noble 
enclosure haram alsharif is considered islams third holiest 
shrine 
israel maintains its police were provoked by palestinian rioters 
who threw rocks from the moslem compound on the temple mount at 
jews worshiping at the adjacent western wall also known as the 
wailing wall 
it has mounted its own investigation by a panel of three senior 
public figures former mossad secret service chief zvi zamir 
leading lawyer yaacov neeman and retired civil servant haim 
kubersky 
before the cabinet meeting justice minister dan meridor said 
the un investigation would violate israels sovereignty over 
jerusalem the mount holy to both moslems and jews is in arab 
east jerusalem which israel captured in the 1967 middle east war 
and later annexed 
the un resolution did not specifically mention a un mission 
to jerusalem but referred only to a visit to the region 
it was the bloodiest incident in jerusalem since israel captured 
the citys arab sector from jordan in 1967 and the worst loss of 
life in a single day of the 34monthold palestinian uprising 
against israel occupation in the west bank and gaza strip

the persian gulf crisis is expected to cost 
the nations school districts nearly 250 million in additional 
fuel charges this year and some officials say that could mean a 
cut in service 
the national school transportation association said it found in 
a september survey that fuel prices for the 370000 buses used by 
us schools had increased an average of 253 cents a gallon since 
the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait 
the nations yellow school buses drive a total of some 35 
billion miles a year transporting about half of all us 
students said karen finkel executive director of the 
association 
no one wants to cut service to schoolchildren she said but 
added that school officials have begun looking at ways to cut fuel 
costs 
shortterm solutions include teaching drivers methods to improve 
fuel economy such as reducing time spent idling and parking buses 
at the schools to eliminate the drive back to the bus lot 
more drastic longterm solutions include reducing the number of 
routes by making children walk longer distances or serving more 
than one school with the same bus 
according to the associations survey the southeast and west 
have suffered the most with average increases of 369 cents and 
342 cents per gallon respectively 
in the northeast the average price was up 281 cents while 
fuel prices were up an average of 269 and 231 cents in the 
midwest and southwest respectively 
but carl janssens executive vice president of national school 
bus service inc says the increased price is obviously one 
thats built on speculation 
weve not had any problem with supply theres no shortage 
said janssens whose barrington illbased company operates 3000 
buses in new york massachusetts maine new hampshire new jersey 
pennsylvania michigan illinois wisconsin and minnesota 
the los angeles unified school district has had experience 
dealing with such a crisis about 20000 school students were put 
off school buses 10 years ago because of budget cuts said bud 
dunevant director of transportation 
and the persian gulf crisis is only increasing the problem 
dunevant said 
the district uses about 9 million gallons of gasoline and diesel 
fuel a year and dunevant said last years bill was 42 million 
however he estimated that by the end of this school year the 
cost will reach 62 million 
were dealing with it because we have to said dunevant 
noting the busing done now is required by the court to eliminate 
discrimination or by law to transport special education students or 
to relieve overcrowding 
about 2900 school buses are used daily to transport 82000 
students the school districts total enrollment is 625000 
dunevant estimates an additional 6000 students will be riding 
the bus by the end of the year with the bus fleet increasing to 
well over 3000 by the end of the year 
we can make some changes in the way we do transportation he 
said its possible that we might make some changes that we dont 
like to have to do that would save some money but wed only do 
that if it appears necessary and if the board authorizes us to do 
it 
william westcoat supervisor of automotive maintenance for 
marylands montgomery county public schools said it was a remote 
possibility that more schoolchildren would be forced to walk 
longer distances to school because of the fuel crisis 
in montgomery county 63000 of the 103000 youngsters enrolled 
ride school buses each day 
the district is not required to provide bus service to 
elementary schoolchildren who live with a mile of school middle 
school youngsters who live within 1 miles and high school students 
who live with 1 miles 
westcoat said increasing those distances to cut down on service 
and save money could put children at risk because they would have 
to walk farther to school 
its a remote possibility at this time he said id say 
it would have to be very critical before we would go to that 
extent 
the districts budget calls for paying 75 cents a gallon for 
fuel but the cost now is an average of 115 a gallon westcoat 
said about 2 million gallons of gasoline and diesel are used each 
year 
although the problem hasnt been considered formally westcoat 
said school officials could cancel field trips and athletic trips 
rather than cut daily bus service 
other options for urban areas westcoat said are enticing 
high school students to use mass transit as opposed to providing 
the yellow school bus

ludwig van beethoven the composer who gradually 
went deaf lost his hearing and died from a rare rheumatic disorder 
that is easily treated by modern medicine a doctor was quoted 
sunday as saying 
the theory challenges previous claims that the german composers 
deafness was caused by syphilis and that he died from liver failure 
brought on by alcoholism the sunday times said in reporting the 
findings 
the newspaper said dr tom palferman a rheumatologist and 
amateur cellist has spent 10 years sifting through beethovens 
private letters and autopsy reports to arrive at his diagnosis it 
said his findings will be published in the royal journal of 
medicine this month 
i approached the problem as if beethoven was one of my own 
patients palferman told the newspaper 
his theory is that beethoven died of sarcoidosis which affects 
hearing and eventually destroys the liver the newspaper said the 
doctor believes beethoven could have been treated with modern 
steroids and his life saved by a liver transplant 
the composer lived from 1770 to 1827

the british museum says 24 drawings from its 
celebrated rembrandt collection may not have been done by the 
master a newspaper reported sunday 
the conclusion by the museum which has the worlds largest 
collection of rembrandt drawings is expected to touch off a major 
dispute among art scholars the observer said in its report 
the british museum has the worlds largest collection of 
drawings by the 17th century dutch painter and etcher 
the suspect drawings nearly a quarter of the museums 
collection are now being attributed to rembrandts pupils or 
followers they include three of the museums bestloved drawings 
credited to rembrandt a picture of his sleeping son one of his 
wife and a nude study of his mistress the newspaper said 
the museum decided to reevaluate the drawings as it prepares for 
a major 1992 exhibition of rembrandt drawings 
the downgraded works were probably not made as fakes although 
some of them may have been fraudulently passed off as rembrandts at 
some point in their history said martin royaltonkisch the 
british museums curator and organizer of the exhibition 
christopher white royaltonkischs predecessor at the british 
museum opposes insists several of the downgraded drawings are 
genuine 
the questions mirror a similar debate over rembrandts 
paintings earlier this century about 1000 paintings were 
recognized as rembrandts but scholars now believe the number could 
be as low as 300

democrat harvey gantt found a bright spot 
in president bushs recent campaign appearance on behalf of his gop 
rival sen jesse helms it brought helms out in public 
i was delighted to be in the same town with sen helms 
today gantt said thats about as close as weve ever gotten 
to being with him 
helms refuses to debate gantt and the conservative gop senator 
has been limiting his public appearances this year 
his distrust of the news media runs so deep that his campaign 
takes reporters questions only by fax machine the answers are 
sent back the same way 
the major papers in this state are biased and they misquote 
and take out of context what our campaign says said beth burrus 
the spokeswoman for helms reelection effort this is a way to 
keep them accountable 
the conservative helms criticizes liberal media in virtually 
every stump speech he makes 
as in previous campaigns helms has flooded the airwaves with 
television advertising telling supporters in a recent fundraising 
letter that he needed another 1 million to buy television ads 
i guess his campaign has learned time and time again that you 
cant trust the unpaid media said thad beyle a political 
science professor at the university of north carolina reporters 
may not tell it exactly like you want it told 
with paid media advertising you can tell it the way you 
want to tell it and nobodys there to question it 
during the august congressional recess the helms campaign 
announced only a few public appearances although helms insisted he 
had been campaigning around the state without telling reporters 
since then the fax machine has been almost the only way for the 
news media to communicate with the helms camp 
helms himself has held only a few brief sessions with reporters 
and no campaign officials will talk with the press on the 
telephone 
in one fax exchange the charlotte observer inquired about a 
helms ad in it an unidentified woman accuses democrat gantt of 
supporting sexselection abortions and abortions in the last few 
weeks of pregnancy gantt says the ad is untrue 
who is the woman in the helms for senate abortion ad the 
observer asked in a question sent to the helms campaign 
the reply why do you want it 
the helms campaign only began releasing a schedule of public 
appearances in september after helms had returned to washington 
his campaigning since then has been limited to weekend rallies 
before select crowds of supporters and quick flyins such as the 
fundraising breakfast with bush last week 
gantt has tried to make an issue of helms reclusive campaign 
style 
it represents a double standard in coverage of the senate 
campaign said gantt press secretary susan jetton 
we go out of our way to have harvey out there every day 
answering questions talking to reporters we make sure reporters 
have a schedule days in advance of where harvey will be she 
said 
the widespread use of fax machines has given helms just one more 
way to hold reporters at arms length beyle said 
ive always found his relationship with the media curious 
given his background beyle said referring to helms stints as a 
newspaper city editor and broadcaster you would think with his 
background he would be able to play the media like a violin 
after bushs visit last week gantt said it was interesting to 
note that mr helms still needs to bring the president in to speak 
on behalf and to defend his record 
why doesnt he simply come on out now and speak for himself 
gantt asked hes got 18 years in the senate he seems to lack 
the courage to want to come out and speak to the people of north 
carolina and let them talk back to him 
in his three terms in the senate helms has fostered an image in 
north carolina as a downhome boy fighting the city slickers in 
washington 
but his political organization the congressional club has 
always been on the cutting edge of technology it raises funds 365 
days a year with sophisticated computerized mail techniques and 
over the years has finetuned the 30second attack ads it 
developed 
in 1980 beyle said the congressional club showed you could 
win an election with a candidate that wasnt seen by anybody john 
east 
east a political science professor and political unknown 
unseated us sen robert morgan with a hardhitting television 
campaign east a polio victim who used a wheelchair made few 
public appearances and his television commercials showed east from 
the shoulders up talking into the camera 
television ad campaigning reached new heights in 1984 when 
helms and gov jim hunt blitzed the airwaves in a 25 million 
campaign that was the most expensive senate race in history

police chief nicholas pastore is trading 
in his force of drugbusting doughnuteating militiamen for what 
he calls social engineers 
the new chief has banned leather driving gloves on police 
officers as too intimidating and has told the members of his force 
to steer drug users to treatment programs instead of jails 
hes also told his officers to knock off the frequent 
coffeeanddoughnut runs during their breaks because it gives them 
a bad image with the public 
i want the police to be perceived as a helpinghand agency 
said pastore who has been on the job for seven months 
that perception can be bolstered if officers among other 
things help drug users rather than just arrest them the new chief 
said 
weve tried the tanks the helicopters the big guns for many 
years it doesnt work pastore 52 said in a recent interview 
i dont subscribe to the philosophy that the more arrests you 
make its going to solve the crime problem 
arrests in new haven a city of 125000 dropped sharply when 
pastore discontinued sting operations to round up drug buyers he 
has also stopped dispatching teams of officers into highcrime 
neighborhoods for roundtheclock arrests and disbanded the 
departments canine unit 
instead he ordered about 20 more officers to walk beats placed 
officers at highvisibility posts throughout downtown and made 
extensive community outreach efforts to end what he calls the 
wethey mentality in druginfested neighborhoods 
he also walks the streets of crimeplagued neighborhoods 
himself frequently striking up conversations with known drug 
dealers 
when im seen in these neighborhoods people realize this man 
cares he said 
his actions have brought praise from various members of the 
public and business community but have put him at odds with the 
police departments union 
a group of downtown merchants recently presented pastore with a 
a plaque for his efforts to increase police visibility but sgt 
louis g cavalier the head of the police officers union 
complained that the steppedup presence has merely provided the 
community with a false sense of security 
pastore has also won the confidence of at least one drug users 
mother who called him recently to say she needed to talk to 
someone she could trust 
the chief believes marijuana use should be decriminalized and 
he said his efforts to encourage addicts to seek treatment reflects 
his belief that the drug problem should be resolved by physicians 
not lawyers 
such views earned him a prominent profile in the august issue of 
high times a magazine devoted to marijuana smoking 
pastore said he didnt know the freelance writer who spoke with 
him was doing the interview for high times but he added that he 
was accurately quoted and had no problems with the story 
his comments in a newspaper interview that there would be fewer 
coffeeanddoughnut runs now that he was police chief ruffled some 
feathers in the department union officials accuse him of 
frequently entering restaurants and asking officers what they are 
doing 
there is the sense that the chief is on their backs 
constantly cavalier said 
pastore said he recalls only one such restaurant incident he 
added that his doughnut policy is not an attack on his officers 
work ethic but on the traditional concept of police work 
police work should not be just doing what the dispatcher says 
then in between going to dunkin donuts he said 
he praises his officers but dismisses the unions criticism 
the union doesnt care about the public he said all they 
care about is whats good for them they have become a group of 
militant mercenaries 
pastore came into office with a mandate to shake up the 
department and move to a concept of communitybased policing in 
which officers are assigned to individual neighborhoods because of 
a tight city budget the new program has gotten off to a slow 
start 
firstterm mayor john daniels a friend since high school 
bypassed nearly 20 internal candidates in hiring pastore who had 
spent 18 years with the department before retiring in 1981 because 
of a congenital kidney defect the ailment has since been 
corrected 
his style is perhaps a little different from your typical 
police chief but if it serves a successful effort im all for 
it said michael dearington the chief state prosecutor in new 
haven some innovation is due in the area of law enforcement

nelson mandela and mangosuthu 
buthelezi are old friends who find themselves in a power struggle 
propelled by violence that could delay the opportunity for blacks 
to govern south africa 
the nations two most powerful black leaders have known each 
other since the 1940s both want black majority rule but they have 
different visions of the future and neither appears ready for 
concessions that might stop the bloodshed between their supporters 
if the violence becomes endemic this country could be worse 
off after liberation than before city press the largest 
blackoriented weekly said recently 
mandela who leads the african national congress and buthelezi 
conservative head of the zulubased inkatha freedom party 
repeatedly call for peace but each blames the other for the 
fighting 
people are actually dying because the anc will not talk with 
inkatha and mandela will not talk with me buthelezi said 
but then buthelezi who also leads the kwazulu homeland 
rejected an invitation to join other homeland leaders in talking 
with mandela 
buthelezi insists on a facetoface meeting with mandela 
mandela who is even willing to meet rightwing whites has 
refused 
anc leaders say buthelezi has orchestrated the factional 
fighting as a way to obtain such a meeting and enhance his stature 
buthelezi a quicktempered man bristles at the suggestion and 
accuses the anc of trying to crush its black rivals 
violence between followers of the anc and inkatha in black 
townships around johannesburg has claimed about 800 lives since 
early august but has eased somewhat in recent weeks in the 
eastern province of natal the ancinkatha conflict has left about 
5000 dead since 1986 
president fw de klerk says he wants to negotiate the end of 
the apartheid race policy that denies political power to blacks 
but that no progress is possible until the factional fighting is 
under control 
mandela also wants to negotiate but his militant young 
supporters in the black townships demand arms and want results 
buthelezi at 62 a decade younger than mandela insists inkatha 
be represented at blackwhite peace talks and claims the anc wants 
to exclude him 
his zulu supporters often are blamed for initiating attacks 
there are strong suspicions unproven that some inkatha supporters 
have acted with at least tacit approval from some sectors of the 
police 
the anc the largest black opposition group is 
socialistoriented and has fought the government with boycotts 
protests calls for sanctions and a guerrilla campaign that was 
suspended in august inkatha rejects those tactics and favors 
capitalism 
power more than ideology is the focus of their conflict 
thousands of young men beyond the leaderships control are 
waging what amounts to gang warfare 
in many neighborhoods a road becomes the dividing line between 
anc and inkatha followers young men fight in the name of 
mandela or buthelezi but know little about the groups the 
men lead 
buthelezis welltailored suits capitalist economics and 
opposition to violence against the government make him appear less 
threatening to whites than other black leaders the government has 
hinted at seeking an alliance with him 
when clad in his leopard skins at zulu ceremonies buthelezi 
also is the politician who appeals most strongly to tribal 
loyalties and the zulu warrior tradition 
he sees tribalism as a fact that must be addressed in any 
political settlement 
zulus although divided politically are the countrys largest 
tribe numbering about 7 million 
inkatha claims 18 million members virtually all zulus while 
inkatha is strong among the rural poor the anc gets much of its 
support from urban educated middleclass blacks 
the anc plays down ethnic differences and has national support 
that cuts across tribal lines most observers believe it would get 
the most votes if the countrys 30 million blacks were allowed to 
cast ballots 
mandela and buthelezi both joined the anc in the 1940s and 
exchanged warm letters during mandelas 27 years in prison 
i remain indebted to him because of our friendship and the 
support that he has given to me mandela has said 
exiled anc leaders gave their blessing to inkathas formation in 
1975 but were against buthelezi becoming leader of the kwazulu 
homeland the anc sees the 10 black homelands as part of the 
apartheid system while buthelezi considers them a step toward 
majority rule 
since de klerk began his reforms black groups have battled each 
other more than the government 
the trouble with our country is that we do not have a 
tradition of dissent of allowing different points of view said 
desmond tutu the black anglican archbishop

there is a saying have a glass of vodka in the 
morning and youll be free all day long said viktor who led a 
recent meeting of alcoholics anonymous in moscow 
more than 20 million soviet citizens regularly take that advice 
and the problem seems to be growing worse 
prosecutors say alcohol contributed to 70 percent of the citys 
violent crimes last year 
while viktor told two dozen recovering alcoholics of the motto 
that sustained his 26 years of drinking sasha swayed in his chair 
obviously drunk it was sashas first meeting and no one was sure 
whether he would return 
at the meetings tearful conclusion speakers told of broken 
marriages lost jobs and the struggle to stay sober 
alcoholics anonymous an american program enjoys some success 
after three years in moscow and has the grudging respect of 
authorities but the overall war on alcoholism in the soviet union 
is going badly 
theres enough work here to last three lifetimes said jeb 
byrd a psychotherapist with the caron foundation of pennsylvania 
his nonprofit organization has a clinic in moscow that combines aa 
methods with outpatient counseling 
alcohol abuse is increasing the number of heavy drinkers is 
estimated at 20 to 25 million in a total population of about 290 
million 
at truck garage no 21 in southeastern moscow supervisor sergei 
borisov said he had to fire 120 people for drunkenness between 1985 
and 1988 or 20 percent of his workers the garage is a dispatching 
point for bread trucks 
drunks stagger across moscows broad streets at night or 
panhandle in parks during the day some pool resources for a bottle 
and drink it on a street bench or in a stolovaya a sort of 
standup cafeteria 
many end up in drunk tanks or overcrowded ineffective treatment 
clinics 
in march president mikhail s gorbachev admitted the 
antidrinking campaign he started five years ago under which 
alcohol production was drastically reduced had not worked 
treatment and rehabilitation programs are acknowledged failures 
nikolai s chernyk of the allunion voluntary temperance 
promotion society asked parliament this month to revive the 
gorbachev program but some lawmakers oppose a return to coerced 
sobriety 
when the program was implemented shortly after gorbachev took 
power in 1985 long lines formed at liquor stores and public anger 
grew some alcoholics drank perfume cleaning fluids or glue 
others made moonshine which cut seriously into the sugar supply 
and angered more temperate citizens 
the government lost 47 billion rubles in alcohol sales during 
the three years that supplies were severly curtailed chernyk said 
in an interview 
production of alcohol has been increased again although it is 
not plentiful in stores the long lines are gone 
taking into account what is happening to our economy nowadays 
the government had to return to the old ways and so we again began 
increasing the sales chernyk said and as soon as we started 
increasing the sales we began to have the negative effects of 
alcoholism 
vladimir treml a duke university professor who has written 
extensively on drinking in the soviet union said statistics on 
crime life expectancy accidents and causes of death all point to 
increased alcohol abuse 
according to official figures and his own estimates treml said 
per capita consumption of pure alcohol and moonshine by soviets 
aged 15 and older amounted to 95 quarts in 1989 that did not 
include beer and wine 
a complaint from a spouse relative neighbor employer or 
police can land an alcohol abuser in one of the occupational 
therapy institutions known as ltps for their initials in russian 
they are barracklike camps run by the interior ministry and 
surrounded by fences topped with barbed wire 
in the ltps alcoholics are treated more like prisoners than 
patients treml said they receive no medical attention and are used 
as cheap labor receiving only onethird of their regular pay 
an estimated 200000300000 people are in the ltps and many 
have been drafted to pick potatoes in the current harvest crisis 
some reports say alcoholics have even been sent from the camps 
to work in distilleries 
inmates have gone on strike in recent months demanding an end 
to guards and punishment cells and such privileges as family 
visits and packages 
parliament is considering measures to reform ltps and put them 
under the ministry of health rather than the interior ministry 
which runs the national police 
chernyk said his temperance society had cured 8000 alcoholics 
in the past year but recovering alcoholics and such experts as 
treml say the organization is ineffective 
treml said the group advocates prohibition not temperance and 
tries to destroy the reputations of medical specialists who promote 
moderation 
chernyk said his group is ready to cooperate with such groups as 
alcoholics anonymous which has 12 chapters in moscow and 13 more 
in various soviet republics 
a recent dinner in moscow attracted about 450 recovering 
alcoholics who were using the aa method said jw canty chairman 
of the sovietus joint conference on alcoholism and drug 
addiction 
soviet programs employ some of those methods like having 
alcoholics keep journals and embrace some form of spirituality or 
religion including the russian orthodox church

winstonsalem nc ap a 58yearold former grocery store 
clerk accused of using arsenic to poison two husbands and a 
boyfriend over 16 years goes on trial monday and could get the 
death penalty if convicted 
blanche taylor moore once described by a police official as 
an average ordinary neighborhood lady is charged with 
firstdegree murder in the oct 7 1986 poisoning death of raymond 
reid who was her boss and later became her boyfriend 
although several women are on death row only one woman has been 
executed in this country since the 1976 us supreme court ruling 
allowing states to resume the death penalty velma barfield also 
of north carolina was put to death in 1984 at age 52 for poisoning 
a boyfriend 
prosecutors say mrs moore systematically poisoned reid james 
n taylor her first husband who died in 1973 and the rev dwight 
moore her second husband who survived 
nonfatal amounts of arsenic also were found in the bodies of 
her father who died in 1966 and motherinlaw from her first 
marriage who died in 1970 no charges were filed in those cases 
moore was hospitalized in may 1989 shortly after returning home 
from his honeymoon doctors were perplexed by his severe nausea and 
vomiting tests showed the burlington minister had ingested a near 
fatal dose of arsenic he remains disabled from it 
hospital officials notified police who began checking into the 
past of moores bride 
they discovered that reid 50 had died three years earlier 
after a long hospital stay his body was exhumed and an autopsy 
showed he died from arsenic poisoning 
a subsequent autopsy also found a fatal level of arsenic in the 
exhumed body of taylor who died at age 45 in 1973 at the time 
his death was attributed to a heart attack 
mrs moore will be tried later on the second murder charge in 
taylors death and assault charges in the poisoning of moore 
since her arrest july 18 1989 mrs moore has been held without 
bail in the alamance county jail in graham just a few miles from 
burlington where she had once lived and worked at the local 
krogers grocery store 
mrs moore has steadfastly maintained her innocence 
shes been stuck in a cell in the county jail and it has 
taken its toll one of her attorneys mitchell mcentire said 
last week but she has a spirit about her that remains very 
strong 
her innocence has given her the strength to overcome it all 
while prosecutors declined to discuss the case mcentire said he 
expects the trial to last from six to eight weeks including jury 
selection he said dozens of witnesses will be called by both 
sides 
i think it will be difficult to pick a jury he said adding 
that the judge denied a defense motion for a different location for 
the trial because of extensive pretrial publicity 
after mrs moore was charged in the three poisonings police 
also investigated the deaths of several of her relatives and 
friends 
medical examiners subsequently found abnormally high but not 
fatal levels of arsenic in the bodies of her father parker kiser 
sr who died at age 62 in 1966 after suffering his eighth heart 
attack and isla taylor mrs moores motherinlaw who died in 
1970 at 83 
no charges were filed in those deaths 
last spring there was a new spin in the case 
a fivepage handwritten letter was delivered may 25 to mrs 
moore at the jail the letter dated may 19 was signed by garvin 
thomas 59 of burlington who had died of natural causes may 22 
it letter said thomas was obsessed with mrs moore and that he 
confessed to the poisonings 
prosecutors have since claimed mrs moore wrote the letter 
herself but defense lawyers claim they have evidence to prove that 
thomas wrote the letter shortly before he died

two months after the united states recruited 
some unlikely partners to stand against iraq experts are asking 
whether the group can withstand the diverse views of its members 
the clash between the united states and its allies over a united 
nations resolution condemning israel and fridays assassination of 
an egyptian leader highlight the possible risks to the 
international coalition 
from its largest shareholders the united states and britain to 
its smallest participants norway and denmark the antiiraq 
grouping has achieved an unparalleled degree of unanimity 
its stated goal in defense of which members have deployed 
military forces and stopped trade with iraq is to oust president 
saddam hussein from kuwait and stop him from attacking other 
oilrich neighbors 
the first major test of the cohesion came last week when yemen 
an iraqi ally introduced a resolution condemning israel for 
killing 19 palestinians after jewish worshipers were attacked in 
jerusalem 
in an attempt to placate its arab coalition allies the united 
states broke with precedent and agreed to condemn israel but it 
also wanted the un resolution to criticize the palestinian 
violence and rejected language calling for un measures to 
protect palestinians under israeli occupation 
that put president bush at odds with egypt syria and other arab 
members of the antiiraq coalition as well as with his european 
partners including france 
its terribly important for bush to succeed on this if hes 
going to retain credibility as the head of the coalition said 
robert hunter a former presidential aide whos now an analyst at 
the private center for strategic and international studies 
white house chief of staff john sununu said sunday that there 
had been discussions about seeking further un sanctions against 
iraq 
there are some concerns about the terrible things that 
have been done in kuwait the dismantling of a population the 
atrocities that have taken place there sununu said on nbcs 
meet the press 
bush he said feels strongly that iraq ought to receive 
international condemnation on those matters 
saddam has from the start tried to drive a wedge between the 
united states and the arabs by portraying himself as the protector 
of palestinians and other downtrodden arabs in a class struggle 
against wealthy americans and their expansionist ally israel 
he has hit a responsive chord among egyptians syrians and other 
arabs splitting them from their governments which are lined up 
against him in the sands of saudi arabia thus the us refusal to 
strongly condemn israel has embarrassed those arab leaders who are 
called upon to defend their positions at home 
i dont think the coalition can withstand this sort of double 
standard by the united states said rashid khalidi associate 
director of the center for middle east studies at the university of 
chicago its a weak link 
but vice president dan quayle said sunday that there was no 
connection between the palestinian question and saddam 
the problem in the middle east is not israel quayle said on 
cbs face the nation we still have a special relationship 
with israel we always will the problem is saddam hussein 
the resolve of the arab leaders could also be threatened by more 
concrete forms of iraqi intimidation 
on friday gunmen killed egypts parliament speaker and four 
security men outside a luxury cairo hotel the shootings came days 
after the government warned that terrorists might punish egypt for 
opposing iraq 
there was no claim of responsibility in the slayings 
experts predicted the resolve of egypt and other arab nations 
that have traditionally struck a united front against the west no 
matter what disagreements they had could be systematically weakened 
if iraqi proxies start a campaign of terror 
other experts believe that time and an erosion of domestic 
support are the greatest enemies 
as time goes on each party discovers that its own interests 
arent necessarily compatible with those of the others said 
judith kipper a scholar at the brookings institution a 
washingtonbased research group 
if the confrontation with saddam drags on without resolution 
americans might start demanding that president bush bring home the 
165000 troops he has sent to the region 31 of whom have been 
killed in accidents 
japan which has contributed funds to the coalition also has 
problems at home 
the government under pressure from washington to increase its 
role in the gulf has proposed sending troops to the region but 
the legislation faces an uncertain future in parliament because 
lawmakers say an overseas force violates japans constitution 
another scenario for trouble envisions iraq trying to split the 
coalition by agreeing to negotiate on formulas that fall short of 
the us demand for an unconditional withdrawal from kuwait 
peace feelers from us allies france and the soviet union have 
fizzled but jordan and yemen are putting forth various proposals 
for resolving the crisis without war 
if saddam made a genuine offer to negotiate or began 
withdrawing his forces it is likely that some european and arab 
allies would press for facesaving concessions to saddam said 
marvin feuerwerger a fellow at the washington institute for near 
east studies 
negotiations could drag out allowing saddam to strengthen his 
hold on kuwait and to exploit differences in the international 
coalition and within the united states feuerwerger said

the marching band at grand junction 
central high school has gotten cold feet over doffing their 
footwear and hotfooting it across a bed of burning coals this 
month 
band members had planned to attend a motivational seminar called 
the firewalk experience it concludes with a barefoot walk 
across burning coals reputed to be 1200 degrees 
firewalking counselor michael douglas said the feat would be 
painless and will show people that they can shatter selfimposed 
limitations 
it motivates people to reach their peak performance said 
douglas who has used the technique in his work as a drug and 
alcohol counselor 
however parents got concerned over safety and liability and 
band leader gary ambrosier said central high school principal bill 
lange decided if a student got hurt the school could get in real 
trouble 
the last thing i want is a lawsuit brought against me and the 
school he said 
ambrosier said he had hoped the experience would improve the 
band members marching and music and also their grades and their 
selfconfidence 
ambrosier came up with the idea after seeing a video of the mesa 
state college football tam and coaching staff performing a similar 
feat last week after listening to douglas twohour presentation 
if those clunkheads can go across i can too ambrosier 
said 
john taylor a university of colorado physics professor known as 
mr wizard for his physics for fun television show has 
walked on redhot coals numerous times 
i think the main point is that these coals are poor conductors 
of heat as you stand on them briefly there isnt enough time for 
the heat to transfer into your feet said taylor 
he said the key is to walk deliberately and not dawdle you 
dont have to run but ive never heard of anyone standing on the 
coals taylor said

moslem guerrillas claimed on sunday 
they had captured strategic security outposts and killed more than 
200 afghan troops in the latest attempt to capture the capital 
kabul 
the afghan government in a broadcast on state radio said its 
soldiers killed 177 guerrillas trying to overrun the city and 
destroyed a huge cache of weapons and ammunition 
claims by both the guerrillas and the kabul government are often 
exaggerated and impossible to verify independently 
midia the news agency of the guerrillas governmentinexile in 
pakistan said guerrilla fighters had captured 16 outposts in 
intense fighting south and east of kabul and chipped away at the 
security belt surrounding the city 
the agency said 16 guerrillas were killed in the latest battle 
to unseat the sovietbacked government of afghanistan 
but official kabul radio monitored in the pakistani capital of 
islamabad said the guerrillas had suffered heavily losses in the 
twopronged attack 
the radio said sporadic fighting including handtohand combat 
continued in several places near the city but that the worst 
fighting was over 
fighting between the resistance and government troops usually 
intensifies from late september to early november before winter 
storms blanket the mountains that ring the capital 
diplomatic and guerrilla sources said fundamentalist guerrillas 
stepped up their attacks in early october and were preparing to 
launch a major offensive on the heavily fortified capital 
more moderate guerrilla commanders have opposed the plan and 
were drawing up a strategy to counter the fundamentalists 
the guerrillas financed by the united states saudi arabia and 
other arab states have been fighting for more than 12 years to 
topple the communist government that seized power in an april 1978 
coup 
soviet troops intervened in december 1979 to back the kabul 
government and withdrew in february 1989 under a unmediated 
agreement

a scientist planning to dig up a 
collection of ancient spear points says archaeology must be served 
but one critic dismisses the effort as a treasure hunt and indians 
say it may disturb a burial ground 
at the center of the controversy is a cache of 11000yearold 
stone spear points and other tools that may have belonged to people 
who crossed the land bridge from asia to north america at the end 
of the last ice age 
the excavation is to take place starting next week under the 
direction of michael gramly of the museum of science in buffalo 
ny 
local indians fear that graves will be disturbed and washington 
state university archaeologist peter mehringer charges that gramly 
is rushing into the dig needlessly 
mehringer was especially critical of gramlys tentative proposal 
to place artifacts from the site on display in museums across the 
country 
a traveling roadshow is no excuse for an awful desecration 
said mehringer who headed a preliminary dig at the site in 1988 
its not archaeology its a treasure hunt 
members of the colville confederated indian tribes say their 
concerns have been ignored they are planning a sitin when the 
monthlong excavation begins next sunday or monday 
they are digging up the remains of some of our ancestors 
said matthew dick jr cultural resources director for the tribe 
mehringer agreed the area may be a burial site but gramly said 
there is no evidence of human remains and that he has a state 
permit to dig he said the museum also intends to return whatever 
is found once it has been studied and displayed 
frankly what i see here is we are looking at the future of 
north american archaeology gramly said if i cant explore an 
archaeological site and make a decision on what is there we will 
have no archaeology in this country 
if human remains were found scientists would want to compare 
them with living people to see if there was a relationship with a 
specific group such as an indian tribe gramly said 
the site was unearthed in ma 1987 by two employees installing 
water sprinklers at an apple orchard in this small central 
washington city 
the orchard and the artifacts are owned by mack richey a renton 
doctor richey did not return a telephone call seeking comment on 
why he prefers to have gramly excavate the site 
mehringers preliminary excavation in 1988 revealed a cache of 
distinctive fluted stone points some up to 9 inches long also 
found were four tools made from the bones of extinct animals 
the items were taken to the buffalo museum and huge concrete 
slabs were placed over the site to protect the remaining artifacts 
the stone points known as clovis points were used during a 
500year period ending about 11000 years ago 
clovis points are named for a site near clovis nm where they 
were first found in the 1930s the base of each point was notched 
or grooved to make it easier to fasten to a spear shaft 
other clovis sites that have been uncovered were heavily damaged 
by the time they were found but this one was intact 
the items found at this site may have been set in their present 
positions by some of the earliest dwellers of north america 
mehringer said scientists want to learn the signficance of the 
placement 
jake thomas the state historic preservation officer who issued 
gramly his permit said there were no signs of human remains at the 
site because the site is privately owned and because gramly is a 
qualified scientist the state had little choice but to issue a 
permit thomas said 
mehringer suggested a oneyear delay until all the issues are 
resolved 
there is no reason to dig the site he said its not 
threatened 
but gramly said the site could be damaged by looters and farming 
activity 
he added that richey who owns the land has indicated he wants 
the artifacts to eventually go to a public institution in the state 
of washington 
george frison of the university of wyoming a highlyregarded 
clovis archaeologist knows both men and considers them both good 
scientists but says hes heard too many stories about the 
controversy to know what to believe 
he said he does not hold it against gramly that he has sold 
artifacts something gramly says he has never done for personal 
profit 
hes in the museum business and museums buy and sell 
artifacts all the time frison said he said his only problem 
with gramly is that he doesnt understand why hes in such a hurry 
to excavate the east wenatchee site

one of every four medical schools does not 
require students to be immunized contributing to outbreaks of 
rubella and measles in hospitals and schools according to a newly 
reported survey 
not one medical school surveyed followed all federal vaccination 
recommendations against preventable infectious diseases 
researchers reported in an article in mondays annals of internal 
medicine 
the findings come as public health officials worry about a major 
outbreak of more than 19000 measles cases in this country in the 
first 35 weeks of this year the majority of the cases were 
attributed to failure to vaccinate 
researchers from the mayo clinic in rochester minn and the 
veterans affairs medical center in minneapolis surveyed 144 medical 
schools in the united states and canada 115 responded their 
report did not name any participating schools 
the failure to require immunization has left students and 
patients unprotected against preventable diseases the researchers 
said 
when a medical student or doctor gets rubella and sees a 
pregnant woman or child or elderly patient the outcome could be 
deadly warned the studys lead author dr gregory poland of the 
mayo clinic 
the survey completed in 1988 found that 28 percent of the 
schools responding to the survey had no immunization requirements 
of entering medical students which number about 15000 a year 
thirtyone percent of the schools had no rubella immunity 
requirement 40 percent lacked a measles immunity requirement and 
44 percent did not require proof of polio vaccination 
the researchers noted that 97 percent of all the schools 
required at least one immunization before students began their 
clerkships a training period in which they help treat patients 
poland said he was shocked at the reports findings calling 
them unacceptable 
were exposed to so much more than the general population 
he said adding that previous studies have found that medical 
students in clerkships or residency are 13 times more likely to 
contract measles than the public 
poland said hospitals and medical schools were lulled into 
thinking these diseases werent a problem anymore because they 
saw fewer cases each year that lessened the perceived need for 
vaccinations he said 
but these viruses are there all the time waiting to come 
back he said 
since the survey was completed in 1988 poland pointed out the 
country has seen an outbreak of measles and mumps with cases 
nearing prevaccination levels 
poland said the study was sparked by the researchers earlier 
findings published in january that identified medical students as 
the source of 13 percent of reported measles and rubella outbreaks 
from 198088 
poland said not one of the schools surveyed followed all the cdc 
recommendations for vaccinations against measles rubella mumps 
tetanusdiphtheria hepatitis b and polio the cdc also urges 
medical students to receive annual flu shots 
even when state laws required vaccinations not all schools 
complied he said 
the authors urged schools to establishimmunization policies 
that include subsidized or free vaccines methods for monitoring 
student compliance and required proof of vaccination from a 
physician

the trial of a jamaican immigrant on 
charges he killed a boston policeman during a drug raid has focused 
on allegations that the slain officers partners lied to get the 
warrant that set up the raid 
the case has prompted questions about the validity of other 
warrants obtained by the drug squad and the general integrity of 
police investigations 
the allegations against the officers also have been raised by 
some who question the quality of recent boston murder 
investigations including the charles stuart murder case 
police now believe stuart killed his pregnant wife and then 
wounded himself in october 1989 then later committed suicide when 
the story began unraveling but they initially accepted stuarts 
account that he and his wife were attacked by a black man and named 
a man as a suspect 
arguments and testimony in the murder trial of albert lewin 
began in this northwestern massachusetts city oct 4 after the 
case was moved from boston because of extensive media coverage 
the case against lewin 34 stems from a drug raid feb 17 
1988 when detective sherman griffiths was killed by shots fired 
through an apartment door 
suffolk county prosecutors claim lewin later found sitting in 
the living room of another apartment was the unseen gunman 
three other people in the apartment where he was arrested have 
testified against lewin and in exchange prosecutors have dropped 
charges pending against them 
police have admitted making up an informant whose information 
supposedly was the basis of the search warrant used for the drug 
raid and lewin doesnt match the description of the drug dealer 
described in the warrant 
the case has prompted questions about the validity of other 
warrants obtained by the drug squad and the general integrity of 
police investigations 
the problem is that the law presumes that police officers are 
going to tell the truth the conditions of the job create pressures 
to not tell the truth and offers temptations to get away with it 
said david rossman director of boston universitys criminal 
clinical project 
it brings up the whole issue of the enormous discretion that 
police and prosecutors have in the criminal justice system said 
martin rosenthal managing attorney for harvard law schools 
criminal justice project 
following the admission that police officers had lied a 
commission was appointed to investigate the department changes 
implemented included tightening up monitoring and a special class 
on constitutional rights said spokeswoman jill reilly 
defense attorney max stern maintains lewin is the victim of a 
desperate effort by police to cover up a botched investigation 
the states case rests in part on the testimony of the three 
people all related in the apartment where lewin was found they 
identify lewin as the suspected drug dealer sought in the raid 
one of the three was initially charged with murder in griffiths 
death 
controversy also developed over a fingerprint on the ammunition 
clip of the murder weapon originally deemed useless by boston 
police it was reexamined by the fbi this summer using techniques 
unavailable in 1988 and was identified as lewins 
the print was photographed and then destroyed in a subsequent 
chemical test the defense challenged use of the print as evidence 
because it couldnt be reexamined but a judge ruled the 
photograph could be used 
detective carlos a luna and sgt hugo r amate are awaiting 
trial on charges they lied under oath about an informant and filed 
false police reports in a coverup attempt 
the affidavit filed by detectives to obtain the search warrant 
quoted an informant named john who said a 5foot 6inch hispanic 
drug dealer was dealing cocaine from the apartment where griffiths 
was killed lewin is 6foot2 and jamaican 
the informant was never produced and luna is accused of 
attempting to concoct a story that the man died or couldnt be 
found amate is charged with being an accessory after the fact in 
the alleged perjury 
the case against lewin was thrown out by a superior court judge 
but it was later reinstated by the supreme judicial court 
massachusetts highest court 
the justices called police conduct in the case contemptible 
and disgusting but added 
in order to express its outrage at the reprehensible police 
conduct in this case society need not punish itself by freeing a 
man who may be guilty of murder in the first degree and other 
serious crimes

the army has hushed up the theft of 
military guns explosives and even antitank rockets that have been 
found in the hands of criminals around the country a newspaper 
reported sunday 
since 1984 stolen military weapons worth tens of millions of 
dollars have been used in 349 bombings that killing 13 people 
injuring 165 and causing 16 million in damage the sunday 
patriotnews reported the harrisburg newspaper cited government 
documents obtained under the freedom of information act and 
interviews with officials 
military guns grenades mines plastic explosives and rockets 
have been sold to drug dealers hate groups motorcycle gangs hit 
men and mercenaries the newspaper reported other weapons have 
been stopped by customs agents as they were being smuggled out of 
the country 
antitank rockets capable of piercing armor and blowing up 
tanks buildings police cruisers helicopters and boats have 
been discovered in philadelphia new york city and the detroit 
suburbs the paper said some were in the hands of drug dealers 
in some cases the thieves are soldiers the newspaper reported 
the stolen goods can be sold on the international black market and 
wind up in the hands of terrorists abroad 
the pentagons latest report to congress on theft of government 
property doesnt mention of weapons and explosives despite 
instances across the country of such thefts the patriotnews 
reported 
army officials agreed only last month to abide by a 1987 law 
that mandates they report thefts of weaponry to the us bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms within 72 hours the paper said 
this has been a longterm problem with the military said 
dick helmer a deputy associate director for national security and 
international affairs at the general accounting office the 
accounting arm of congress we are very fortunate there has not 
been a major catastrophe or a lot of deaths 
among the munitions reportedly recovered have been more than 85 
rockets 400 grenades a dozen lad mines antiaircraft shells 
howitzer rounds cluster bombs 25pound fragmentation bombs 200 
pounds of plastic explosives 45 pounds of military tnt and 18000 
bullets 
the army doesnt say the recovered items are stolen reports say 
they come from unexplained origins although many have serial 
numbers that can be traced to any of a variety of bases the paper 
said 
the newspaper said it obtained documents that showed 
the pentagon doesnt know how many weapons or explosives have 
been stolen or what the losses cost the taxpayer 
in the 1980s government agents recovered more than five tons 
of stolen military tnt and c4 plastic explosives a quarterpound 
of c4 which costs the army 120 is enough to blow up an 
airliner 
customs agents confiscated 433 million in weapons and 
explosives that were to be illegally shipped overseas from 1981 
through march of this year 
security is loose at many bases especially where reservists 
train officials are often unable to tell if explosives used in 
training were actually detonated or pocketed for sale on the black 
market 
accounting and supply systems are in such disarray that the 
pentagon often doesnt know if something disappears from inventory 
unless it somehow is found later 
profits are good on the black market a grenade costs the army 
743 but sells on the black market for 50 experts told the 
paper antitank law rockets sell for more than 1000 each on the 
street

lebanon and france quarreled sunday over 
the fate of gen michel aoun whose 11month mutiny in the 
christian heartland was crushed by a syrianled military blitz 
aoun remained inside the french embassy where he fled during 
saturdays attack and was granted asylum 
lebanese officials were insisting the 55yearold general remain 
in the country for possible trial on charges including the alleged 
theft of 75 million from the state treasury 
we shall not violate international law and go get aoun out of 
the french embassy justice minister edmond rizk said in a 
statement but we shall exercise our judicial rights if the 
embassy decides to take him out of lebanon because he is wanted for 
trial 
staccato bursts of machinegun fire echoed across the pine woods 
surrounding the shellshattered presidential palace in the 
christian suburb of baabda helmeted syrian troops searched the 
hills for supporters of the defeated general 
aoun was forced into surrender saturday after 11 months of 
resisting the syrianbacked government his defeat moved lebanon 
closer to an end of its 15yearold civil war 
the christian general had opposed the governments peace plan 
which gives the moslem majority an equal share of power but gives 
no timetable for withdrawing the 40000 syrian troops in the 
country 
after fighting battles with the syrians moslems and a rival 
christian militia aouns territory had been reduced to an 
80squaremile enclave north and east of beirut 
he escaped an assassination attempt friday night and had pledged 
to die fighting but he fled his headquarters during the 
onslaught by syrian troops 
the casualty toll from the eighthour crackdown on aouns 
enclave stood at 160 dead and 800 wounded by police count 
the casualties included 32 syrian soldiers killed and 85 
wounded their bodies were flown to damascus by two syrian army 
helicopters police said 
syrian and lebanese troops set up checkpoints on roads leading 
to the french embassy in beiruts christian suburb of hazmiyeh 
embassy guards mined the walls 
syrian soldiers and troops of hrawis army besieged the embassy 
saturday night hours after aoun and three senior aides took refuge 
there the embassy compound also houses ambassador rene alas 
residence 
there were no soldiers in the embassys immediate vicinity later 
sunday 
a lebanese neighbor of the compound who identified himself only 
by his first name antoine said the soldiers left this 
morning 
antoine said aoun arrived at the embassy entrance in an armored 
personnel carrier early saturday 45 minutes after syrian warplanes 
and artillery started bombing the presidential palace 
he was met at the entrance by ambasador ala as they ran on 
foot toward alas residence shells started falling on the embassy 
compound they nearly got killed antoine said 
the embassys swimming pool was hit by shells as was the main 
lobby a carpet of glass shards and debris blanketed the main 
entrance 
france the traditional protector of lebanons christians 
promptly granted aoun asylum saturday 
ala met with hrawi in moslem west beirut on sunday to try to 
resolve the issue presidential spokesman may kahhaleh said ala 
left after two hours without making a statement 
france must pardon us for not swallowing its hasty decision to 
grant asylum to aoun said cabinet minister nabih berri he 
should stand trial as a plain criminal not a politician 
christian warlord samir geagea whose lebanese forces militia 
fought a fourmonth power struggle with aouns men early this year 
also said the defeated general should be brought to justice and 
tried as a criminal 
aouns fall tightened syrias hold on lebanon which the syrians 
consider their strategic backyard syria the main power broker in 
lebanon sent its troops to lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping 
mandate 
sources close to hrawi said his next step would be to move to 
the presidential palace they said a new government would be formed 
under prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem to supervise the 
unification of beirut 
the capital has been divided into christian and moslem sectors 
since outbreak of the civil war in 1975 
aoun had tried to establish himself as the legitimate authority 
in lebanon since september 1988 when he was appointed caretaker 
prime minister by president amin gemayel 
hrawi was elected president nov 24 1989 with a mandate to 
enforce the peace plan brokered by the arab league 
after his election hrawi promptly dismissed aoun as army 
commander and interim prime minister but the general denounced 
hrawi as a syrian puppet and refused to leave the presidential 
palace

iraqi leader saddam hussein indicated to a 
visiting soviet official last week he might remove his troops from 
kuwait in return for some kuwaiti territory along the persian gulf 
a soviet news agency reported 
the governmentrun novosti press agency said the shift in iraqs 
position raised the kremlins hopes for a diplomatic solution to 
the standoff but an editor at the official iraqi news agency 
denied iraq had made any offer of a partial withdrawal 
novosti in a dispatch published sunday by the labor newspaper 
rabochaya tribuna said saddam made the comments in talks with 
yevgeny primakov a top kremlin aide whom president mikhail 
gorbachev sent to baghdad last week to discuss the gulf crisis 
in talks with saddam hussein not once did saddam mention 
the historical rights of iraq to the territory of kuwait 
amounting to a definite softening of the iraqi presidents 
position novosti reported 
from these remarks it follows that iraq might withdraw its 
army from kuwait retaining for itself southern rumaillah and the 
islands warba and bubiyan opening up exits to the sea the news 
agency said 
soviet presidential spokesman vitaly ignatenko had said last 
week that soviet officials were optimistic after the 
saddamprimakov meetings but gave no details 
i can only tell you that we are today more able to look more 
optimistically at the prospect of a political settlement in that 
region ignatenko had said 
but the iraqi news agency in a dispatch sunday quoted an 
unidentified editor as denying any concessions the editor said the 
reports were sheer lies and baseless and those propagating them 
were known and their objectives known too 
historical claims to kuwaiti territory have been among saddams 
official justifications for iraqs aug 2 invasion of the oilrich 
kingdom he also claimed the kuwait government was taking oil that 
belonged to baghdad and that the rule of kuwaitis monarchy was 
illegitimate 
the islands of bubiyan and warba are off the kuwaiti coast near 
the border with iraq rumaillah is one of kuwaits major oil fields 
along the kuwaitiiraqi border near the coast 
by acquiring the three additional sites saddam could vastly 
expand his oil production capacity and open new ports iraq 
currently has only a small coastline from which to export most of 
its oil its main source of revenue 
a usled international economic embargo against iraq enforced 
by a unsanctioned air and sea blockade has cut off iraqs major 
oil markets 
us defense secretary dick cheney is visiting moscow wednesday 
and an official at the pentagon said cheney would ask for 
intelligence on iraq the official complained moscow had failed to 
provide washington with data on the iraqi military which the 
soviet union has been arming for a decade 
the soviet union has backed un sanctions against iraq and has 
two ships in the gulf but gorbachev has declined to send in more 
saying the conflict should be settled peacefully 
the weekly moscow news on sunday published an article by an 
international security expert who called for the soviet union to 
send a volunteer military contingent to the gulf 
such action could strengthen the armys prestige and its role 
as guarantor of stability law and order wrote alexei 
arbatov of the institute of world economy and international 
relations

police chief nicholas pastore is trading 
in his force of drugbusting doughnuteating militiamen for what 
he calls social engineers 
the new chief has banned leather driving gloves on police 
officers as too intimidating and has told the members of his force 
to steer drug users to treatment programs instead of jails 
hes also told his officers to knock off the frequent 
coffeeanddoughnut runs during their breaks because it gives them 
a bad image with the public 
i want the police to be perceived as a helpinghand agency 
said pastore who has been on the job for seven months 
that perception can be bolstered if officers among other 
things help drug users rather than just arrest them the new chief 
said 
weve tried the tanks the helicopters the big guns for many 
years it doesnt work pastore 52 said in a recent interview 
i dont subscribe to the philosophy that the more arrests you 
make its going to solve the crime problem 
arrests in new haven a city of 125000 dropped sharply when 
pastore discontinued sting operations to round up drug buyers he 
has also stopped dispatching teams of officers into highcrime 
neighborhoods for roundtheclock arrests and disbanded the 
departments canine unit 
instead he ordered about 20 more officers to walk beats placed 
officers at highvisibility posts throughout downtown and made 
extensive community outreach efforts to end what he calls the 
wethey mentality in druginfested neighborhoods 
he also walks the streets of crimeplagued neighborhoods 
himself frequently striking up conversations with known drug 
dealers 
when im seen in these neighborhoods people realize this man 
cares he said 
his actions have brought praise from various members of the 
public and business community but have put him at odds with the 
police departments union 
a group of downtown merchants recently presented pastore with a 
a plaque for his efforts to increase police visibility but sgt 
louis g cavalier the head of the police officers union 
complained that the steppedup presence has merely provided the 
community with a false sense of security 
pastore has also won the confidence of at least one drug users 
mother who called him recently to say she needed to talk to 
someone she could trust 
the chief believes marijuana use should be decriminalized and 
he said his efforts to encourage addicts to seek treatment reflects 
his belief that the drug problem should be resolved by physicians 
not lawyers 
such views earned him a prominent profile in the august issue of 
high times a magazine devoted to marijuana smoking 
pastore said he didnt know the freelance writer who spoke with 
him was doing the interview for high times but he added that he 
was accurately quoted and had no problems with the story 
his comments in a newspaper interview that there would be fewer 
coffeeanddoughnut runs now that he was police chief ruffled some 
feathers in the department union officials accuse him of 
frequently entering restaurants and asking officers what they are 
doing 
there is the sense that the chief is on their backs 
constantly cavalier said 
pastore said he recalls only one such restaurant incident he 
added that his doughnut policy is not an attack on his officers 
work ethic but on the traditional concept of police work 
police work should not be just doing what the dispatcher says 
then in between going to dunkin donuts he said 
he praises his officers but dismisses the unions criticism 
the union doesnt care about the public he said all they 
care about is whats good for them they have become a group of 
militant mercenaries 
pastore came into office with a mandate to shake up the 
department and move to a concept of communitybased policing in 
which officers are assigned to individual neighborhoods because of 
a tight city budget the new program has gotten off to a slow 
start 
firstterm mayor john daniels a friend since high school 
bypassed nearly 20 internal candidates in hiring pastore who had 
spent 18 years with the department before retiring in 1981 because 
of a congenital kidney defect the ailment has since been 
corrected 
his style is perhaps a little different from your typical 
police chief but if it serves a successful effort im all for 
it said michael dearington the chief state prosecutor in new 
haven some innovation is due in the area of law enforcement

the new york city opera performed martha in 
its first season in february 1944 on saturday night it performed 
the friedrich von flotow opera for the first time since then with 
serious singing and charming decor 
martha is almost an operetta when plunkett sung by dean 
peterson says early on that his brother lionel sung by martin 
thompson is a foster brother it sounds like gilbert and sullivan 
lionel is surely going to turn out to be noble 
all four leading singers in the new york state theater were 
excellent all sang as though in the most serious of operas which 
martha needs 
the production maximizes charm and fun the first performance of 
martha was in vienna in 1847 this one is set in the 1920s in 
england and sung in english with subtitles 
in the first scene chorus women are in attractive pastel 
flapper dresses later they wear them again with different color 
coordination 
comic cops enter bumping into each other cars are used 
cleverly but not too much in the second scene at a rural fair 
one tiny car careens along a background roller coaster when the 
two women are being rescued car lights are seen approaching in the 
distance and later going away much faster 
sheryl woods had a lovely tone and light unforced coloratura as 
martha lucille beer as her servant nancy has a marilyn horne 
kind of mezzosoprano voice strong on its deep side 
the music is pleasant one problem is that the story doesnt 
today seem very nice operas of villainous revenge somehow are 
easier to take 
lady harriet maid of honor to the queen is bored so she 
decides that she her servant and her cousin sung by joseph mckee 
should go to a fair dressed as peasants she calls herself martha 
plunkett and lionel farmers offer to hire the two women as 
servants for a year and they accept 
theres a funny scene with a crankturned washer and wringer 
which the men show the servants how to operate the two men 
have fallen in love lionel asks martha to sing to him and she 
sweetly sings the last rose of summer shes in love too but 
wouldnt consider somebody so far beneath her 
that night the women climb out a window into her cousins car 
when plot turns get lionels ring to the king its discovered 
that hes really the earl of derby martha now tells him she loves 
him he says that shes just interested in the earl of derby 
program notes say that having lost his reason he rebuffs her 
it sounds like he had a point 
the two couples wind up together 
the metropolitan opera has performed martha since it moved 
to lincoln center in 1966 but did not make of it such a jolly romp 
john lehmeyer directed and costumes were created from his 
designs john michael deegan who did the warm bright lighting 
and sarah g conly designed sets mary corsaro choreographed all 
were debuts with the company arthur fagen conducted

a court on sunday upheld the dismissal 
of prime minister benazir bhutto ruling that corruption and 
mismanagement had stalled her government after 20 months in office 
the lahore high courts decision will likely be challenged in 
the supreme court in any case national elections are set for oct 
24 so a victory for either side would be merely a moral one 
four lawsuits filed by supporters of ms bhuttos pakistan 
peoples party argued that president ghulam ishaq khan had 
overstepped his constitutional authority by abruptly dismissing ms 
bhuttos government aug 6 
khan fired ms bhutto on charges of corruption nepotism and 
abuse of power and installed a militarybacked caretaker 
government the former prime minister has denied the charges and 
called her dismissal a political move 
meanwhile a poll released sunday showed ms bhuttos opponents 
would likely win the october elections but that the ousted prime 
minister would command a formidable political force after the 
balloting 
the poll by gallup pakistan indicated ms bhutto and her 
pakistan peoples party would take 30 percent of the vote the 
largely rightwing coalition the islamic democratic alliance 
would win 40 to 45 percent it said the poll gave no margin of 
error 
the sixjudge panel on sunday rejected the contentions of the 
peoples party and cited eight grounds for ms bhuttos ouster and 
the appointment of a caretaker government 
we find that the president was justified in the opinion that 
the government could not be carried on in accordance with the 
constitution and an appeal to the electorate was necessary the 
court said in its ruling 
ms bhutto is being tried on the corruption and other charges by 
special onejudge tribunals in lahore and her hometown of karachi 
the high court noted that ms bhuttos government had offered no 
substantial legislation while in power faile to resolve disputes 
with the provincial governments and deprived them of vital revenue 
it alleged ms bhuttos government violated individual human 
rights by tapping the telephones of highly respectable people 
including supporters and was discriminatory in civil service 
appointments 
the court accused ms bhutto of publically ridiculing the senate 
and the judiciary and alleged she misused millions of dollars in 
government funds to buy political favors

a procession of hindu conservatives 
arrived in the capital sunday on a 6000mile pilgrimage to promote 
the building of a temple on a site claimed by moslems and now 
occupied by a mosque 
tens of thousands of supporters cheered the twomilelong 
procession as it reached the capital 20 days after setting out from 
the western city of somnath 
the procession was led by lal krishna advani leader of the 
indian peoples party who rode in a toyota pickup converted to 
look like a chariot used in festivals to carry hindu idols 
the pilgrimage was on a roundabout route to the holy town of 
ayodhya 300 miles southeast of new delhi and home to the disputed 
site hindus revere ayodhya as the birthplace of lord rama an 
important hindu god 
hindu fundamentalists want to tear down the mosque they claim 
replaced a temple destroyed in the 16th century by moghul 
conquerers moslem leaders dispute the claim and refuse to vacate 
the site neither side will compromise 
never in the 40 years of my political life have i seen such 
vast popular support for an issue advani told press trust of 
india 
news agencies said police put dozens of advanis supporters 
under preventative detention in towns along the route apparently 
fearing moslemhindu clashes 
earlier police used truncheons to clear a path for the 
procession through a crowd of 200 people protesting a new 
government policy that would reserve half of federal jobs for 
lowercaste hindus suppressed for centuries 
there are 17 million unemployed educated youths many of them 
from the upper castes the new policy over which more than 60 
students have committed suicide has overshadowed the deeper 
problem between the two religious communities 
while advani prepared for a rally expected to draw more than 
100000 supporters peoples party activists drove through the city 
on trucks garlanded with marigolds blaring a message that the 
temple will be built 
the dispute is also laced with politics piting not only hindus 
against moslems but prime minister vp singh against advanis 
peoples party which provides crucial support to keep the minority 
government in power 
the fundamentalists say they will tear down the mosque and begin 
building the new ram temple on oct 30 with or without permission 
the uttar pradesh local government has said it will not allow 
advanis procession into the state 
singh has urged restraint until a court rules on petitions 
submitted by both sides advani has said however it was not a 
matter for the courts to settle 
advani has said the peoples party will decide in november 
whether it will continue to support singhs coalition implying the 
temple issue may determine its stand a withdrawal of support could 
lead to an election next year 
hindus comprise 82 percent of indias 880 million people 
critics say mounting tensions fueled by the procession through 
eight indian states were responsible for two outbursts of violence 
between hindus and moslems over the last two weeks in which at 
least 80 people died

vice president dan quayle said sunday the bush 
administration is violently opposed to a democratic plan for a 
large increase in the top tax rates paid by the wealthiest 
americans 
but a principal supporter of the increase rep dan 
rostenkowski chairman of house ways and means committee said he 
would seek its approval this week as part of a deficit reduction 
plan in an election campaign test of strength 
im not going to deny that were trying to make a political 
statement and there certainly is evidence that theres now a 
division between democrats and republicans said rostenkowski 
dill 
quayle and rostenkowski made their comments on sunday television 
news programs setting the stage for this weeks attempt in 
congress to fashion a 500 billion fiveyear package of spending 
cuts and tax increases to rein in the federal deficit 
if congress fails to approve an acceptable deficit reduction 
plan before midnight friday white house chief of staff john sununu 
said chances were relatively high the federal government would 
shut down for a second time this month 
when congress refused to pass the first deficit plan that 
administration officials and congressional leaders had labored over 
for months bush closed the government for the threeday columbus 
day weekend the impact was tempered by the holiday and bush later 
agreed to a temporary spending measure 
aside from the deficit reduction plan congress hopes to 
complete work on comprehensive clean air legislation a civil 
rights bill a new farm bill and several other major pieces of 
legislation before it adjourns forthe year sometime in the next 
two weeks 
there are several hundred billion dollars in spending cuts in 
the package including more than 13 billion in agriculture 
spending 
any deficit reduction plan also is expected to curb the defense 
buildup cut medicare and restrain spending in hundreds of federal 
programs but most of the debate in recent days has centered around 
whose taxes should be raised and by how much 
rostenkowskis house ways and means committee approved a 
proposal that would raise the top tax bracket from 28 percent to 33 
percent 
we want to protect middle income and poor america and we want 
everybody to share in the pain of governing rostenkowski said on 
cnns newsmaker sunday 
he said he would be willing to compromise if need be but that 
he believes the 33 percent tax rate is necessary 
but sununu said on nbcs meet the press that the 
administration was opposed to playing around with the income tax 
rate for americans across the board 
an alternative plan was approved by the senate finance committee 
early saturday without the increase in the upper tax bracket that 
plan relies on limiting deductions taken by the wealthy to increase 
tax collections 
in addition both plans would raise the taxes on gasoline 
alcohol tobacco and such luxury items as furs jewelry and 
expensive cars 
i had tried to get a 33 percent rate and the president could 
not accept it at all said sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman 
of the senate finance committee 
so he said his committee came through the back door by 
limiting deductions on wealthy americans 
and that means that we have a progressive table that those 
making the highest income will pay the highest increase in the 
taxes he said on abcs this week with david brinkley 
bentsen said he would defend his plan on the senate floor but 
noted that some compromise is likely before a final bill emerges 
from congress 
quayle on cbs face the nation said bush was prepared to 
reject any deficitreduction plan he dislikes regardless of how 
long the process takes 
they are going to have to stay in town and pass a budget 
quayle said referring to members of congress the president is 
simply not going to let the congress go home until they pass a good 
deficitreduction plan that is going to avoid a recession 
the original package which included the budget for the 1991 
fiscal year that began oct 1 was killed by the house

deficitreduction plans backed by house democrats and the senate 
finance committee

the 9cent tax to 18 cents a gallon by 1992 neither bill would 
affect heating oil 
indexing the house would forgo for one year the annual 
adjustments to income tax brackets and personal exemptions which 
are designed to protect against inflationcaused bracket creep 
that would mean higher income taxes for everybody in 1991 the 
senate has no such provision 
alcohol house raise the 1250agallon tax on 100proof 
liquor by 1 double the beer tax to 32 cents a sixpack raise 
taxes on most wines including table wine which would go from 3 
cents a 750milliliter bottle to 25 cents senate raise liquor 
tax by 120 double beer tax raise wine tax to 21 cents 
tobacco either would raise the 16cent cigarette tax by 4 cents 
in 1991 and another 4 cents in 1993 snuff cigars and other 
tobacco would face 25 percent tax increases each year 
flying either would raise the 8 percent tax on airline tickets 
to 10 percent 
luxuries either would impose a 10 percent tax on the portion of 
the price of cars above 30000 boats above 100000 jewelry 
above 5000 furs above 10000 house or 5000 senate and 
private planes 100000 house or 250000 senate 
tax rates the house bill would raise the top rate paid by the 
wealthiest people now 28 percent to 33 percent it would impose a 
10 percent surtax on those with taxable incomes over 1 million 
the senate bill would do neither 
itemized deductions the senate would limit itemized deductions 
except those for medical expenses and investment interest of 
people with adjusted gross income over 100000 only 95 percent of 
deductions would be allowed against the portion of income above 
100000 
capital gains the house bill would allow a person to avoid tax 
on half of up to 200000 of capital gains earned in a lifetime 
the gains could come from most investments but not from stocks a 
person with annual income under 100000 could avoid tax on another 
1000 a year of gains including those on the sale of stock no 
capital gain would be taxed at a rate above 28 percent the senate 
bill has no capitalgains provisions 
lowincome both bills would increase the earnedincome tax

israeli soldiers received incredible orders 
to beat up arabs while quelling riots at the start of the 
palestinian uprising a senior officer was quoted as saying sunday 
the testimony by col yoni shimshoni coincided with growing 
world criticism of use of force by israeli security forces 
following the temple mount killings by police of at least 19 arabs 
during a riot last monday 
shimshoni spoke at the trial of col yehuda meir the highest 
ranking israeli officer tried during the 34month uprising who is 
charged with sanctioning excessive use of force 
meir is accused of ordering soldiers to break the bones of 
palestinian rioters in two west bank villages in january 1988 
while serving as commander of the nablus area 
he was charged march 29 on seven felony counts the most severe 
was causing bodily harm with malicious intent which carries a 
maximum 20year jail sentence 
according to the charges soldiers under meirs orders detained 
21 palestinians in two west bank villages bound and gagged and 
then beat them with rifles and clubs 
meir has admitted giving the orders claiming they were in 
keeping with instructions from former defense minister yitzhak 
rabin to beat rioters as a deterrent measure 
rabin has repeatedly said beatings were allowed to control a 
riot but that troops were told detainees could not be struck 
unless they resisted arrest 
the beatings were intended to reduce the number of deaths from 
gunshot wounds in the uprising which began dec 8 1987 
some beatings have resulted in deaths four officers were 
convicted on oct 1 of aggravated assault for a beating in which a 
21yearold palestinian died in february 1988 
testifying sunday shimshoni who served two years ago in the 
nearby tulkarem area suggested he also had given troopers orders 
to beat palestinians with backing from superiors 
shimshoni said meir and other commanders would voice despair 
over the instructions about which it wasnt clear how they should 
be carried out 
when i think about it now shimshoni reportedly told the 
radio it is hard to believe that i did that that i gave such 
orders 
today i understand that some incredible things were done 
there under the perception that we are in a state of war with no 
time to stop and think shimshoni was quoted as saying 
another officer brig gen david yaacov a former operations 
officer in the west bank was quoted as saying the orders were 
clear that rioters should be beaten with force to deter them from 
repeating their actions 
yaacov said many detainees reached detention centers with 
broken limbs or fractured skulls after being hit with clubs the 
top commanders knew well what was happening

highexplosive bombs for iraq that could radically alter the 
strategic balance in the persian gulf according to a newspaper 
report sunday

baghdads behalf with chilean arms manufacturer industrias cardoen

developed the explosives for the spanish air force in 1984 and 
1985 technology for the weapons was manufactured by ms systems

spanish prohibitions against arms sales to libya or iraq would 
have forced any spanish company to export through a third country

source is reported to have said 
cardoen developed fuses for the bombs the newspaper said the 
company is building a 60 million hightechnology fuse factory near 
baghdad it said it wasnt clear whether the factorys status had 
been altered by the unordered sanctions on doing business with 
iraq 
shortly after the un embargo was imposed on iraq cardoen 
tested fae about 50 miles north of iquique in chiles atacama 
desert the newspaper said the test attended by cardoen 
scientists and five spanish engineers was not reported to the 
chilean authorities it said 
beaver said the the british army was very concerned when it 
learned the soviets possessed the explosives which they reportedly 
used in afghanistan 
they would have wreaked havoc with tanks in europe so imagine 
the anxiety felt over iraq getting their hands on them he said

chain of pet stores by a wholesaler turned out to be poisonous but 
the mistake wasnt noticed until some had been sold to the public 
venomous asian water snakes known as redneck keelbacks were 
mistakenly labeled as harmless garter snakes some of the snakes 
bought by petland discounts were distributed among the companys 50 
stores in the metropolitan area 
the health department issued a public warning friday 
afterward the aspca picked up five snakes from pet owners who 
called for help two of them turned out to be keelbacks 
in addition 14 venomous snakes were removed from stores and 
taken to the zoo 
redneck keelbacks are not usually aggressive but a bite can be 
fatal if not treated said peter lynn a health department 
spokesman 
the snakes are about 18 inches long and about as big around as 
your pinky said marilynn levine spokeswoman for the bronx zoo 
they are orange but look like common north american garter snakes 
a selftaught snake handler whose discovery of the mistake led 
to a tristate snake alarm said he tried to tell people but 
initially no one would listen newsday reported sunday 
but they believe me now said tom robertson jr

noticed the keelbacks 
i told the police the federal wildlife service i called a 
lot of places to no avail robertson told newsday 
the guys in the store didnt believe me and got nasty about 
it said robertson i brought back a book but they still 
didnt believe me 
it was the city health department that took him seriously its 
inspectors called a new york university biologist who confirmed 
robertsons suspicions 
a person who answered the phone friday at the pet store 
headquarters refused to comment

a savings and loan became insolvent after 
lending president bushs son jeb and a partner about half the money 
toward purchase of a 9 million office building and the federal 
government ended up repaying most of the loan a newspaper reported 
sunday 
the new york times reported that the loan arrangement involved 
no criminal behavior but stood as an example of some savings 
institutions poor lending practices that led to the industrys 
troubles 
the transaction was unrelated to civil charges in denver that 
the presidents youngest son neil 35 acted improperly in his 
role as a director of silverado banking savings and loan 
association that sampl failed in 1988 after making questionable 
loans 
the miami deal involves jeb bush 37 and his partner armando 
codina who own a partnership called 1390 brickell 
in 1985 the two men bought a miami office building at that 
address for 9 million they used a 7 million mortgage from an 
insurance company and a 4565 million loan from broward federal 
savings and loan of sunrise fla the surplus money was to be used 
for improvements and a reserve account 
the loan from broward federal was obtained through je houston 
financial group headed by j edward houston a former fort 
lauderdale banker and associate of bushs and codinas 
broward federal became insolvent in 1988 and the federal 
government paid more than 4 million to make good the loan on the 
miami property as part of the bailout of the sampl industry 
bush and codina negotiated a settlement with regulators in which 
they repaid 505000 and retained control of the building the 
times said 
the times said that bush and codina expressed surprise that the 
settlement could be interpreted as the use of taxpayers money to 
bail out the loan asked if they were aware the money for the 
repayment of the broward federal loan came from the taxpayers both 
men said no 
federal officials defended the agreement the newspaper said 
saying it was the best settlement available because of the weakened 
commercial real estate market in miami and because the loan was 
secured by a risky second mortgage 
they said jeb bush received no preferential treatment the times 
said 
a lawsuit between the 1390 brickell partnership and houston over 
who should pay back the 4565 million was settled out of court 
under the auspices of federal regulators 
they were authorized to step in because of a dec 31 1988 
agreement under which the assets and liabilities of broward federal 
were sold to california federal bank a los angelesbased sampl 
the agreement called for the government to guarantee any loss 
experienced by cal fed in taking over browards affairs and to pay 
cal feds costs in managing the loans and any litigation to resolve 
them

iraq has said it will allow more than a 
hundred soviet military advisors and oil technicians to leave 
baghdad for moscow on sunday according to soviet diplomats in the 
iraqi capital 
four britons meanwhile arrived in amman jordan on sunday from 
baghdad with youssef islam a former singer known previously as cat 
stevens he said british nationals held in iraq and kuwait have 
suffered more than others because of prime minister margaret 
thatchers intransgent attitude toward iraq 
a soviet tupolev 154 arrived in baghdad to pick up the 120 
soviet nationals who were to leave late sunday the diplomats said 
on condition of anonymity 
their departure would leave another 180 military advisors still 
in iraq which before its aug 2 invasion of kuwait depended on 
moscow for the bulk of its advanced weaponry 
the diplomats said that when their contracts expired the 
remaining advisors would leave but that they could also choose to 
leave before then 
iraq threatened last week to restrict the travel of soviet 
military advisors if moscow disclosed any iraqi military secrets to 
the united states 
us defense secretary dick cheney will ask soviet officials for 
intelligence on iraqi weaponry when he visits moscow this week a 
senior defense department official has said in washington 
islam arrived in amman aboard a commercial iraqi airways flight 
along with the four britons shiite moslems stranded in iraq after 
the invasion the british embassy said the five would leave for the 
united kingdom early monday 
the men were identified as mohammad gulamhossein mohammad sh 
rahim said hassan askari and anwar haj abdullah a british 
embassy official said islam secured their release after a month of 
negotiations 
the four all of indian or pakistani origin were making 
pilgrimages to the moslem shrines of najaf and kerbela in iraq when 
the invasion occurred 
islam called their release a symbolic gesture by iraq 
he accused mrs thatcher of adopting a stubborn attitude toward 
iraq during the 2monthold standoff he did not however specify 
how the britons had suffered more than the hundreds of other 
westerners detained by saddam hussein 
more than 1000 us nationals and 1500 britons are still held 
in iraq and kuwait iraq has sent about 700 westerners to strategic 
sites to deter against attack by the usled multinational forces

hotel which they were free to leave he said they were overfed

kuwaiti opposition figures meeting 
with their governmentinexile said sunday they want guarantees of 
democratic reform in a future liberated kuwait 
one prominent arab nationalist blamed the aug 2 iraqi invasion 
on the lack of democracy throughout the arab world 
when we are liberated we have to go down to the roots and see 
what went wrong in kuwait and elsewhere in the arab world said 
ahmed alkhatib 
we live in an arab world where no government is really 
representative of its people he said no government came 
through elections 
his views unsually frank by kuwaiti standards were expressed 
as 750 kuwaiti businessmen economists and politicians gathered 
over the weekend to explore ways of ending the iraqi occupation of 
kuwait and charting out a democratic path for its future 
the kuwaitis here were impatient saying that the un trade 
embargo on baghdad will not work and expressing hope that the 
usled multinational force would launch military action against 
iraq 
international unanimity could be adversely affected in 
saddams favor of course unless the americans act without delay 
said former parliamentarian mubarak duweileh who fled kuwait to 
saudi arabia after the invasion 
those attending the conference were agreed on seeking national 
unity under the leadership of the emir sheik jaber alahmed 
alsabah but they said greater democracy would be necessary if 
kuwait were regained 
if we are liberated khatib said we have to present 
ourselves to the world and underscore our respect for free 
speech and human rights our demand for democracy at large 
the emir received strong support at the opening session 
saturday his crown prince and prime minister sheik saad 
alabdullah alsabah promised that kuwait would enjoy a 
democratic system of government based on the 1962 constitution 
which provided for westernstyle parliamentary rule 
parliament was suspended in 1986 because of pressure from 
opposition deputies at a time when the country was the target of a 
terrorist campaign meant to break kuwaits support for iraq in the 
iraniraq war 
opposition figures at the conference welcomed saads assurances 
but said sunday that they need guarantees 
we are optimistic about the promise the rulers made to return 
to the constitution of 1962 but there are not enough assurances 
said former parliament speaker ahmed alsaadoun who leads 30 
former parliamentarians who oppose the governmentinexile 
kuwaits ordeal has amply demonstrated that politically free 
people can be more instrumental in safeguarding their government 
saadoun told reporters free people stick to legitimacy and 
promote it 
in the past saadoun has accused the emir of violating the 
constitution because he dissolved parliament without holding 
elections within 60 days 
but saadoun insisted that the opposition strongly backs the 
exiled government in its efforts to achieve liberation and he 
denied iraqi claims that the opposition sought to get rid of the 
ruling alsabah family 
article 4 of the constitution states that kuwait is a 
hereditary emirate to be ruled by the alsabah family he said 
this article cannot be amended 
but he demanded the desired national unity be based on the 
basic freedom and participation of the people in shaping the policy 
of state 
saadoun rejected as absurd an iraqi call for a referendum in 
kuwait to determine whether the alsabah family are the legitimate 
rulers of kuwait 
the question of legitimacy has never been at issue saadoun 
said the whole country stands united behind the alsabah family 
we all stand with sheik jaber until kuwait is fully liberated 
afterward we would sit down and discuss whatever shape of 
government is deemed best for the situation 
a conference spokesman mohammed alrumaihi announced that the 
kuwaiti representatives at sundays meeting decided to provide 
military training for all capable kuwaiti youth 
he said they discussed methods of liberation in depth but 
did not elaborate a final communique will be issued monday when 
the conference ends he said

police have rounded up dozens of moslem 
extremists and foreigners suspected of involvement in the 
assassination of the parliament speaker including 25 palestinians 
and iraqis newspapers reported monday 
but iraq denied any involvement in the killing of speaker rifaat 
elmahgoub his driver and four security men friday in cairo 
the official iraqi news agency said the reports linking iraq to 
the slayings were based on the promotion of lies and meant to 
cover up popular indignation against egypts support of the 
usled forces in the persian gulf region 
the stateowned newspaper alahram said in its early edition 
that the suspects also included two pakistanis detained while 
trying to leave egypt it gave no breakdown on how many of the 25 
were palestinians or iraqis 
security authorities have firm evidence the killers were arabs 
who infiltrated egypt to carry out the assassination alahram said 
without elaboration 
another stateowned newspaper alakhbar said sunday that two 
men carrying forged syrian and iraqi passports were arrested at 
cairo international airport as they were leaving the country 
airport security officials said later that three arabs carrying 
australian american and syrian passports were arrested sunday 
all the arrested suspects resembled composite sketches of five 
gunmen compiled from witnesses 
a spokesman at the interior minister which is in charge of 
internal security and police declined sunday to comment on the 
newspaper reports 
in additon to the arabs alahram said an unspecified number of 
local moslem extremists were arrested for questioning it also said 
police were interrogating palestinians and iraqis who were arrested 
before the assassination 
interior minister abdelhalim moussa last week announced the 
arrests of 35 alleged saboteurs and warned of possible terror 
attacks by iraqi agents 
among the previously arrested palestinians were men suspected of 
belonging to abu nidals terrorist group recent reports said abu 
nidal who split years ago with the palestine liberation 
organization has moved his headquarters to iraq from libya 
but the iraqi news agency monitored in nicosia cyprus said 
egyptian news reports accusing iraq one way or another were 
published in accordance with egyptian media policy based on the 
promotion of lies and the misrepresentation of facts 
in the final analysis the fate of he who betrayed egypt and 
the arab nation and failed to keep their pledges will receive 
further blows until he returns to his senses it said in an 
apparent reference to egyptian president hosni mubarak 
a little known palestinian group called the world islamic 
liberation front claimed responsibility for elmahgoubs 
assassination in a telephone call to a western news agency in the 
jordanian capital amman sources in amman said the group was made 
up of publicityseekers who had a record of false claims

chancellor helmut kohls party strengthened its 
dominant national position sunday with a near sweep in elections 
across former east german territory projections showed 
kohls conservative christian democrats took four out of the 
five eastern states adding momentum for national elections dec 2 
and giving the party control of both houses of parliament 
preliminary returns indicated 
the dec 2 elections have not been won the results will come 
on dec 2 kohl said but we are in a good starting position 
according to preliminary returns the main opposition social 
democrats will lose their slim majority in the bundesrat the upper 
house of parliament which bases seats on how parties did in state 
elections the christian democrats already control the lower house 
the former communists who ruled east germany for 40 years 
apparently won seats in state legislatures indicating they may 
have enough support to grab a place in the united german 
parliament 
kohls party easily won in the four eastern states of thuringia 
saxony saxonyanhalt and mecklenburglower pomerania according to 
projections by the german television networks ard and zdf 
the christian democrats were losing the state of brandenburg to 
the leftleaning social democrats in the march national elections 
the christian democrats won that state 
the state elections were important because they finally gave 
those in the former east germany the governors and state 
legislatures who will have to assume a major responsibility for 
removing much of the entrenched communist system 
the december elections will be the first united german elections 
in 60 years kohl the politician most responsible for uniting the 
german states on oct 3 is widely favored to win 
wolfgang thierse a top social democrat in eastern germany said 
the christian democrats dominated because they promised quick 
prosperity to the downtrodden eastern germans 
we cant present ourselves and dont want to present 
ourselves as the party of big money he said we also cant 
present ourselves as miracle workers 
across eastern germany the television projections had the 
christian democrats with 44 percent of the vote the social 
democrats with 25 and the former communists with 11 percent 
if they clear 5 percent of the vote the former communists are 
guaranteed seats in the state legislatures 
the reformed communists now called the party of democratic 
socialism have been the thirdstrongest party in the nation since 
they were ousted from power 
party leader gregor gysi predicted the party would retain enough 
support to win parliament seats in the national elections 
we have good chances to enter parliament on dec 2 he said 
elections also were held in wealthy bavaria the largest of the 
states in former west germany the archconservative christian 
social union was again dominant according to the television 
projections 
the projections showed the ultraright republican party at just 
under the 5 percent hurdle needed to get into the bavarian 
legislature earlier they appeared over the amount needed to win 
seats 
the extremist republicans led by a former nazi ss soldier 
favor tougher restrictions on allowing foreigners to live in 
germany they garnered miniscule support in what was east germany 
according to the projections 
after 40 years without free elections voters in the former east 
germany have now held three in six months and face a fourth in 
december 
in march they chose their first democratic government to 
replace the ousted communist regime toppled by the peaceful revolt 
last year 
the christian democratled government quickly led the nation to 
german unification in may voters elected local governments 
the christian democrats have dominated all the elections by 
promising an unhindered free market economy and fast unification 
with west germany 
however the projections showed them winning by a margin that 
was substantially lower than the margin in the march balloting the 
first free elections in east german history 
the social democrats have tried to capitalize on the terrible 
economic problems in the east german territory since the former 
nation converted to a free market economy 
the five eastern german state governments face the monumental 
task of forming separate adminstrations from the vestiges of the 
old centralized communist system where all power emanated from the 
national party bosses 
the states will have to quickly assume responsibility for 
police education transportation and some social services

american telephone amp telegraph co has cut 
short its offer for us troops in saudi arabia to call home for 
free disappointing soldiers who said the calls boosted morale 
the troops racked up so many calls that saudi communications 
officials complained their longdistance lines were being clogged 
after just one week and an estimated 100000 calls at a cost of 
1 million atampt on wednesday notified the military it was 
scrubbing its free directdial service spokesman david bikle said 
sunday 
atampt had planned to offer usadirect service to troops for two 
weeks 
soldiers are now charged 1604 for a 10minute call home the 
charge is 1829 for a 10minute collect call said atampt spokesman 
rick wallerstein 
the volume of calls had peaked at 1500 an hour with 100000 
calls we gave most people a chance for one call home 
wallerstein said 
us troops have been deployed in saudi arabia since iraq 
invaded neighboring kuwait on aug 2 
in the eastern saudi city of dhahran soldiers formed long lines 
to use phones at the dhahran international hotel when the free 
service was in effect 
i wish they would keep it up sgt john tackitt 27 of 
concord calif told an associated press reporter thursday its 
a good morale booster knowing that you dont have to pay for 
something that you look forward to using 
talking to people at home picks you up a little bit echoed 
spc richard cloud 24 of atlanta you get tired of talking to 
people here because you hear the same stories i wish it was 
free i sure do i dont know how much it is going to cost but im 
calling anyway 
sgt moses clerk of st louis said phone calls made life more 
bearable you can call home and talk to your family and find out 
what is going on at home because sometimes the news does not get 
here on time he said

circuits including the us military reserving 40 lines for its 
own use and a satellite station in riyadh having to shut down for 
repairs 
all that was left were 400 lines and the saudi government 
suggested atampt open up more circuits on the satellite between the 
united states and saudi arabia said the officials speaking on

the romance between justice 
minister bernardo cabral and economy minister zelia cardoso de 
mello was the stuff of scandal sheets for weeks but it was a 
steamy bolero that blew the lid off the affair 
on saturday cabral resigned citing intimate personal 
reasons in his letter to president fernando collor de mello 
neither he nor his alleged mistress have seen fit to comment on 
the relationship that veja newsmagazine the countrys largest 
descriped on its cover sunday as the romance that brought down 
cabral 
but fully detailed reports on the extracabinet relations of two 
of the more important government ministers had been circulating for 
weeks 
even before the rumors started cabral was in hot water with 
collor over his job performance collor was reportedly angry that 
cabral had given him bad advice on the constitutionality of various 
bills 
but for the president who has promised to moralize 
brazilian politics the scandalous evidences of the tryst between 
the 58yearold married cabral and cardoso de mello 37 and 
single were apparently the last straw 
at a sept 19 birthday party for the economics minister she 
danced cheektocheek with her tipsy colleague at a posh brasilia 
club before hundreds of gawking journalists and dignataries 
the guests eyes bulged as cabral whispered in the ear of the 
former economics professor using the intimate diminutive 
baixinha or shorty the romantic ballad they danced to was 
entitled besame mucho which contains the line kiss me a lot 
like tonight was the last time and indeed it turned out to be 
cabrals swan song 
collor outraged only waited to demand cabrals resignation 
because he needed extra time to find a replacement according to 
news reports 
sen jarbas passarinho a widelyrespected conservative was 
named over the weekend to replace cabral 
even before the party the government had commissioned the vox 
populi polling institute to conduct a survey about the potential 
public fallout from the affair eighty percent of those interviewed 
said they were uncomfortable about the reported romance 
leading political commentator gilberto dimenstein noting that 
many gossip columnists were invited to the party where the 
ministers rubbed their noses said cabral had transformed 
adultery into governmental marketing 
the newsweekly isto esenhor published a caricature showing the 
two dancing closely as cabral sighed my god what cheeks 
cardoso de mellos job arguably the most important cabinet 
post in a country whose economy is reeling is the subject of much 
speculation 
local press accounts published sunday said collor had recently 
promised cardoso de mello who is no relation to the president 
she would stay others said she eventually would resign 
in any country of the first world a case like this would end 
with the dismissal of the two an unnamed minister told veja

the government decided sunday against 
cooperating with a un team investigating the shooting deaths of 
19 palestinians by israeli police and said the delegation should 
stay away from israel 
the ministers also delivered a slap to the united states by 
announcing plans to build apartments for immigrants in the occupied 
eastern sector of jerusalem the us government has linked a 400 
million loan guarantee to israels agreement to avoid settling 
immigrants there 
we have read the security councils decision and it is 
completely unacceptable a cabinet communique said as a result 
israel will not receive the delegation of the un 
secretarygeneral 
israel television said the cabinet decision came despite a 
personal appeal to foreign minister david levy from us secretary 
of state james a baker iii who said the un visit would make it 
easier to direct world attention to the struggle against saddam 
hussein 
radio stations said rightwing housing minister ariel sharon 
proposed that the investigators be barred from israel but sharons 
spokesman nimrod granit denied that 
israeli officials however made it clear that they expect the 
threeman mission to stay away 
this is not an invitation to come its an invitation not to 
come said deputy foreign minister benyamin netanyahu 
there is a limit to absurdity it isnt customary to break 
down the door netanyahu said on israel television it is not 
acceptable between countries and not between international 
organizations 
police opened fire last monday on palestinians during a riot on 
the hallowed temple mount sacred to both moslems and jews the 
moslems call it haramessharif 
the riot began when palestinians threw rocks onto worshipers 
praying below at the western wall judaisms holiest site police 
first used tear gas and rubber bullets then live ammunition 
the un security council voted friday to condemn israel and to 
send a delegation to investigate in a rare gesture the united 
states joined in the censure of its ally 
israels cabinet at its regular weekly session sunday said it 
saw no reason for the united nations to intervene when it had 
ignored worse incidents in other countries 
netanyahu said when hundreds of worshipers were massacred in 
mecca they did nothing when hundreds of worshipers were massacred 
at the golden temple in india they did nothing 
in a later meeting of a committee on immigration sharon 
announced plans to build 5000 apartments a year in eight 
neighborhoods six of them in east jerusalem said ida 
benshitreet spokeswoman for the immigrant absorption ministry 
she insisted the housing decision had been planned before the 
un resolution 
this wasnt done to flex muscles there is no doubt we must 
increase immigration to jerusalem mrs benshitreet said 
but the radio said sharon told reporters after the meeting 
jerusalem as the capital of the jewish people is stronger than 
any security council decision 
opposition politicians meanwhile questioned the cabinet 
boycott of the united nations 
haim ramon head of the opposition labor partys parliament 
faction said the un mission could not be prevented from coming 
and should be allowed into israel at a nondiplomatic level 
i wouldnt play angry with the whole world i would accept the 
delegation at a low level to meet with police officers ramon 
told israel television 
levy said the un investigation would violate israels 
sovereignty over jerusalem and pave the way for stationing un 
forces in the city 
the temple mount is in arab east jerusalem which israel 
captured in the 1967 middle east war and later annexed 
israel maintains its police were provoked by the barrage of 
stones onto jews at the western wall also known as the wailing 
wall 
an israeli human rights group on sunday accused police of 
indiscriminate shooting and criminal negligence in the 
bloodshed the group betselem said the government has attempted 
to hide the facts mislead the public and evade 
responsibility in the shootings 
the arab league has called a meeting in tunis to discuss the 
killings and egypt announced sunday it would attend the middle 
east news agency said that could be significant becaause the arab 
league has been split between countries that support iraqi 
president saddam hussein and those who oppose him 
egypt has led arab opposition to iraq while the plo has 
supported baghdad 
arab diplomatic sources in tunis said the other arab league 
members who would attend the meeting included iraq jordan sudan 
yemen algeria tunisia mauritania and morocco 
israeli officials first said palestinians planned the stoning of 
jewish worshipers in advance hoping to provoke an incident that 
would divert world attention from the persian gulf crisis 
but police commissioner yaacov terner later said he believed the 
riot was spontaneous 
it was the bloodiest incident in jerusalem since the 1967 war 
and the worst loss of life in a single day of the 34monthold 
palestinian uprising against israel occupation in the west bank and 
gaza strip 
levy said he hoped to avoid a collision with the united states 
our relations with the united states are very important but 
we should not accept and we should not ignore the sorry fact that 
the us administration has made a mistake levy said 
he added that the united states had followed this coalition it 
formed against iraqi president saddam hussein a reference to 
pressure on washington from moderate arab states to condemn israel 
the arabs have formed a coalition with the united states against 
iraq following its aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
even before the temple mount killings jerusalem was a sensitive 
issue between israel and the united states washington has insisted 
that israel not spend us aid on settling soviet immigrants in 
arab jerusalem 
the government has appointed its own comittee to investigate the 
killings the threeman panel consists of former mossad secret 
service chief zvi zamir leading lawyer yaacov neeman and retired 
civil servant haim kubersky 
it held its first session behind closed doors sunday and 
appealed to witnesses to come forward by noon wednesday 
in the occupied territories sunday one arab was shot and killed 
in clashes with israeli soldiers and ten others were injured one 
seriously 
abdel abu elnimer 73 from khan yunis refugee camp in the gaza 
strip was shot in the chest and arrived dead at nasser hospital 
arab reports said 
the army said it was checking the reports 
elnimers death brought to 761 the number of palestinians 
killed by israeli soldiers or civilians since the revolt against 
israeli occupation began in december 1987 about 279 palestinians 
have been killed by fellow arabs most on suspicion of 
collaborating with israel 
fortyeight israelis have also died in the violence

the longsecret fifth man of kim philbys spy 
ring was john cairncross a former highranking british 
intelligence officer according to a book by a former kgb double 
agent who fled to the west 
oleg gordievsky the soviet agent who came to britain in 1985 
makes the claim in a book kgb the inside story of its foreign 
operations from lenin to gorbachev it was written with 
christopher andrew a cambridge university intelligence historian 
serialization of extracts from the book began saturday in 
londons times newspaper the book was to be released in britain 
and the united states on friday 
in mondays extract gordievsky and andrews say cairncross was a 
spy before and during world war ii he worked during his spy years 
in the foreign office the treasury for a government minister for 
britains electronic eavesdropping center and for the mi6 foreign 
intelligence service the book claims 
the times said the scottishborn cairncross confessed to the mi5 
counterintelligence service in 1964 after interrogation and that he 
lives in the south of france 
this is not a new discovery said labor party legislator ted 
leadbitter this has been known for an awfully long time 
harold kim philby said to be the most damaging double agent 
in british history spied for the soviets for 26 years until he 
defected to moscow in 1963 he and three fellow agents guy 
burgess donald maclean and anthony blunt all now dead turned 
britains secrets over to the soviets 
some scholars of espionage have long suspected that soviet 
penetration of the british secret service did not end with the 
unmasking of the four and that there was probably a fifth man 
others have maintained that the kgb fostered the theory to keep 
western intelligence in doubt 
it was at cambridge university where all five of the men 
studied that blunt talentspotted cairncross and burgess 
recruited him the excerpt says 
philby who rose to become head of the mi6 antisoviet section 
responsible for the study of communism and the soviet intelligence 
services was on his way to becoming head of mi6 when he first came 
under suspicion in 1951 when maclean and burgess fled to moscow 
the times said cairncrosss involvement with soviet intelligence 
has been well documented but he had never been placed in the same 
category as the other four cairncross always claimed he was just 
a small fish the times said 
on the contrary cairncrosss achievements were the equal of 
any of the five except philby the excerpt quotes kgb officer 
dmitri svetanko as saying 
until the end of world war ii when philbys career began to 
take off i think he provided more important intelligence than any 
of the others coauthor andrews told the associated press 
writer chapman pincher and former mi5 officer peter wright 
whose book spycatcher the british government failed to suppress 
in a long court battle both alleged that former mi5 head sir roger 
hollis was a soviet spy 
earlier this year gordievsky said in a bbc television interview 
that hollis who ran the counterespionage service from 1956 to 
1965 was not a soviet agent 
gordievsky began working for the british while posted in 
copenhagen in the early 1970s 
the kgb soviet intelligence service sent him to london but he 
was recalled to moscow he eluded his kgb tail and escaped to the 
west in 1985 his defection led to the retaliatory expulsion of 31 
soviet and 31 british diplomats trade representatives and 
journalists

rep lynn martin assailed sen paul simon in 
their first senate campaign debate sunday for supporting more taxes 
and foreign aid while simon belittled her record on education and 
military spending 
on topics ranging from foreign relations to domestic spending 
the republican congresswoman repeatedly tried to paint democrat 
simon as a taxandspend liberal whose solution to the nations 
problems was to throw money at them 
my opponent will talk again and again about needing more 
money martin said in the televised debate i dont believe 
its just more money we need 
martin said she supports limiting government spending to natural 
revenue growth levels and discontinuing federal programs that prove 
ineffective 
in response simon said he supports modest increases in 
cigarette and alcohol taxes and higher taxes on the wealthy 
i dont believe its just more money but you just cant do 
what you need to do without more resources he said 
ive led my opponent has not said simon a member of the 
senates higher education subcommittee what we need is 
leadership in education and i have provided it 
but martin criticized simons support of additional aid to 
foreign countries when she said illinois ranks second to last among 
states in getting a return on residents tax dollars 
i think it might sadden you to know that guatemala gets more 
of our money than chicagos schools martin said thats under 
my opponents leadership 
simon said more of illinois tax dollars could go towards 
improving education and human services if the country spent less on 
defense and weapons research 
he criticized martin for opposing cuts in defense spending and 
especially in the federal governments proposed star wars 
spacebased ballistic missile system 
we spend three times more per capita for defense of western 
europe than western europeans do simon said what good does 
star wars do us anymore when theres no real russian threat 
anymore 
martin took occasional jabs at simons unsuccessful run for the 
presidency in 1988 saying he still had aspirations for higher 
office while she only wanted to be senator 
but after the debate simon dismissed the notion saying the 
only person in america whose talking about paul simon running for 
the presidency is lynn martin 
they are scheduled to debate again on oct 25

former sen lawton chiles won the endorsement 
sunday of floridas largest newspaper the miami herald over 
republican gov bob martinez in the governors race 
the herald said it endorsed martinez four years ago because he 
was prepared to provide mature leadership the former tampa mayor 
became the first republican to govern the state since 
reconstruction 
the ensuing four years have proved the inadequacy of that 
preparation and the tenuousness of that leadership the newspaper 
said instead of leading martinez settled for antitax 
expediency interspersed with divisive appeals to various 
narrowinterest constituencies 
the herald said chiles is the better choice on nov 6 because of 
his outstanding record and positive campaign promise to banish 
the states deepening political cynicism and because martinez 
has been a serious disappointment 
chiles decided in 1987 against seeking a fourth term saying 
bigmoney politics left him burned out after 18 years in the us 
senate
