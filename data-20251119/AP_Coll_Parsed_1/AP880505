prime minister david lange said 
friday that france has informed him it is allowing the return of a 
second french secret agent who took part in the 1985 bombing of the 
rainbow warrior off new zealand 
lange accused the french government of flouting international 
law with the move 
the new zealand prime minister said he was advised that capt 
dominique prieur was returning to paris forthwith from hao 
atoll 
ms prieur and maj alain mafart the other french agent were 
supposed to remain in exile on the south pacific island until july 
1989 under an agreement worked out by the united nations the 
accord stipulated that they could not leave the island without the 
consent of new zealand 
lange said he expected ms prieur to arrive in paris on friday 
or saturday and that he intends to pursue the matter with french 
authorities 
there has been no confirmation of departure but it is not 
consented to and should she leave it would be a clear breach of 
frances obligation under international law lange said in a 
statement 
ms prieur and mafart were sent to new zealand to stop the 
rainbow warrior from leading a protest flotilla to mururoa a south 
pacific island where france conducts underground nuclear tests 
one crewman on the rainbow warrior was killed in the bombing in 
auckland harbor 
the pair who worked for the french secret service the 
direction generale de la securite exterieure pleaded guilty in 
1985 to manslaughter 
mafart was repatriated in december last year after complaining 
of a stomach disorder 
frances decision to end ms prieurs exile on hao atoll follows 
the release of three french hostages from lebanon and thursdays 
bloody rescue in new caledonia of 23 hostages held by melanesian 
separatists 
all three events could boost the chances of conservative 
candidate prime minister jacques chirac in the runoff in frances 
presidential election sunday he is running against president 
francois mitterrand 
mafart and ms prieur originally were sentenced to 10 years in 
jail their conviction sparked an unprecedented diplomatic row 
between paris and wellington which ended after seven months when 
the sentences were commuted under the agreement worked out by 
javier perez de cuellar the un secretarygeneral 
under the agreement the pair was released into french custody on 
hao a tiny military outpost near mururoa 
in return paris apologized for the bombing paid 7 million 
compensation and promised not to block new zealand exports to 
europe

the national urban league on thursday issued 
an agenda for economic and social change saying presidential 
contenders should be evaluated on their commitment to reverse eight 
years of leadership by an activist against civil rights 
this document presents an agenda for change because it will 
make americas neglected poor people full participants in our 
nations economic and social life said league president john e 
jacob 
what we are trying to do with this document is to force the 
candidates to tell us where they stand on critical issues as they 
relate to our community jacob said 
the group issued a report entitled black americans and public 
policy perspectives of the national urban league 
jacob said the league hopes to help black voters evaluate the 
presidential candidates and to influence the democratic and 
republican party platforms those platforms should be designed 
not only to attract the black vote but designed to address black 
needs 
we believe civil rights and social justice to be an agenda 
item on any presidents program jacob said an agenda item in 
the sense that the pulpit of the presidency is used as a bully 
pulpit to be an advocate an activist president on the behalf of 
civil rights 
he said the greatest achievements in civil rights occurred 
during administrations in which the president expressed such a 
commitment 
the last eight years have also indicated that when we have a 
president who is an activist against civil rights weve had the 
greatest moving back on these kinds of issues he said 
jacob called for full employment programs including job 
training targeted to the most disadvantaged and increased 
educational services to help black youth 
this is the work force that this nation will be depending upon 
in the future he said 
he also urged presidential leadership on welfare reform saying 
the issue cannot be left totally to the congress 
we need a president who is articulating the need to eradicate 
the dependency phase of welfare reform and provide an opportunity 
for people to graduate into independence through training through 
education through skill development he said 
jacob also stressed the need for development of a black economic 
agenda to help foster a business class and increase economic 
stability in the black community and close the wage and the 
wealth gap that exists between the races

the socialist labor party scored heavily in 
municipal elections early friday overtaking the conservatives in 
the first electoral test of tory prime minister margaret thatchers 
radical thirdterm program 
the big loser in thursdays voting was the social and liberal 
democratic party however it was formed in march to merge the 
centrists but a breakaway faction remained a separate party 
with results in from most of the 211 councils being contested in 
england wales and scotland labor had a net gain of 109 seats 
while the conservatives had a net loss of three and the centrists 
lost more than 70 the british domestic news agency press 
association calculated 
at stake were onethird of the nearly 4000 seats in 158 english 
and welsh districts and the entire councils of all 53 cities and 
towns of scotland there are no elections this year in london and 
northern ireland 
a british broadcasting corp computer analysis showed labor took 
39 percent of the vote a ninepoint jump since the general 
election last june while the conservatives had 37 percent five 
points down and the centrists with 18 percent suffered a 
fourpoint drop 
the laborites kept birmingham britains second largest city 
and edinburgh the scottish capital and took control of cambridge 
despite a fivepoint swing against the conservatives compared 
with last june however the tories posted gains in the south and 
took control of five councils where previously no party had control 
the tories had control of 46 of the contested cities and towns 
up five labor had 94 up three the centrists eight unchanged 
while 63 authorities were run by independents or had no overall 
control 
labor tripled its narrow majority in the west england port of 
bristol a prime tory target 
however labor advances were mainly at the expense of the 
squabbling centrist parties while the conservatives made gains in 
their heartlands of the prosperous south 
were absolutely delighted said labors environment 
spokesman john cunningham 
in our strongholds and in the inner cities were making gains 
across the board in the southwest were making a small number of 
gains which is heartening cunningham said 
but mrs thatchers environment secretary nicholas ridley said 
the conservative showing was rather good for a government 
that is making major changes 
polls were open from 8 am to 9 pm thursday 
twenty million britons were eligible to vote in the elections to 
fill the seats last contested in 1984 about 10800 candidates 
were running 
the election was viewed as a litmus test of the sweeping social 
reform program of mrs thatchers government the opposition labor 
party focused on the tax and welfare changes which critics say 
will hurt the poor 
the tougher welfare standards are aimed at ending what the 
tories call britains dependency culture nurtured by the 
welfare state 
the opposition has also criticized new legislation that would 
change the property tax system taxes would be levied on each adult 
in a home rather than on the building critics say the tax would 
double or triple bills for millions of households

thinking a few moves ahead producers of the 
62 million broadway play chess have cut more than 10 minutes 
from the lessthanacclaimed show in an effort to improve its 
position and check overtime costs 
one comment we received from even the people who were 
enthusiastic about the play was that it was too long gerald 
schoenfeld chairman of the shubert organization one of the plays 
coproducers said wednesday we wanted to enhance the show 
we also save a bunch of money said bernard jacobs 
schuberts president but thats incidental if the show doesnt 
make it the amount spent in weekly operating costs is minimal over 
a longterm period 
before the cuts the curtain came down at about 1110 each 
night because overtime begins at 11 the extra 10 minutes a night 
amounted to about 25000 a week in part because its complicated 
sets and lighting requires more than 40 stagehands 
the cuts which total between 11 and 12 minutes bring the 
curtain down before 11 and save all the overtime 
they were agreed to last weekend by trevor nunn the director 
time rice the lyricist and benny andersson and bjorn ulvaeus the

a norwegian official confirmed wednesday that a 
shipment of heavy water which can be used in nuclear reactors 
and in making nuclear weapons was diverted to an unknown 
destination in 1983 the new york times reported 
we have confirmed today that 15 tons of norwegian heavy water 
is missing lasse seim a spokesman for the norwegian foreign 
ministry in washington told the times in an interview 
seim said the diversion appeared to be the result of an 
international conspiracy involving a west german company and that 
norway had asked west germany to investigate the newspaper 
reported in its thursday editions 
the heavy water or deuterium oxide had been sold to a west 
german company rohstoff einfuhr and was to be flown in december 
1983 from oslo to frankfurt seim said but the plane flew instead 
to basel switzerland and the heavy water was then shipped to an 
unknown destination he said 
the oslo government and the company that sold the heavy water 
were unaware of the diversion until press reports appeared in 
norway and germany seim said 
a man identified in norwegian press reports as the operator of 
rohstoff einfuhr alfred hempel has been linked in the past to 
trade in heavy water the times reported citing unidentified 
american officials one us government specialist said he was 
believed to have sold heavy water to india in the past the 
newspaper said 
heavy water can be used to enable nuclear reactors to run on 
natural uranium rather than enriched uranium fuel and to produce 
plutonium which in turn can be used in nuclear weapons india has 
several nuclear reactors that use heavy water

president reagan was asked for disaster 
aid thursday for this city rocked by explosions at a space shuttle 
fuel plant that killed two workers including a poliostricken man 
unable to run for his life officials said 
the man whose body has not been found since the blast 
wednesday had stayed behind to call the fire department said an 
official at the pacific engineering and production co of nevada 
plant 
the blasts leveled 12 buildings at the pacific plant and a 
marshmallow factory steel girders were twisted like pretzels and 
cars parked nearby were barely recognizable chunks of melted metal 
concussions from the blasts shattered windows 10 miles away in 
las vegas jolted airliners in flight peeled off roofs upended 
cars and threw workers through walls broken windows and cracked 
foundations were common in henderson 
more than 255 people were injured four critically 
union officials charged the plant was unsafe and the subject of 
numerous complaints the chairman of the company denied the charges 
the body of bruce bernard halker 56 vice president of 
operations at pacific was identified thursday pacific officials 
told employees thursday that they had concluded a second worker 
leroy westerfield died as well 
mr westerfield had polio some time ago and had difficulty 
moving rapidly said company attorney keith rooker employees at 
the meeting said westerfield couldnt run 
its my understanding that a number of people asked mr 
westerfield to leave and he said no because he had to call the fire 
department rooker said 
the fire and explosions were caused by an equipment malfunction 
said pacific chairman fred gibson jr 
us sen harry reid dnev toured the site after asking 
reagan in a letter to declare henderson a federal emergency 
disaster area a move that would open the door to lowinterest 
loans to enable residents to repair damage 
certainly being here confirms what i did was valid reid 
said 
i think were looking at tens of millions of dollars in 
damages said gov richard bryan 
there were miracles all over town said mayor lorna 
kesterson who declared thursday a day of thanksgiving in the 
community of 54000 
jim thompson president of steelworkers union local 4856 said 
thursday our big problem was trying to get standards and 
procedures developed for handling of this product through either 
federal or state osha occupational safety and health 
administration 
weve had people burned weve had people blown up minor 
explosions that severely injured workers thompson charged i 
think if we had had proper safety standards in effect and caring 
people we would not have what we have today a major catastrophe 
on our hands 
the union released a letter from john molovich safety and heath 
technician with the united steelworkers union following a 1982 
tour of the plant in the letter he called the plant one of the 
worst i have ever been into and added i cannot understand how 
this plant has not been blown off the face of the earth 
it is a safe plant and i am stating there have been no fires 
there gibson countered we had inspections from osha and we 
had no continuing problems with anything 
osha officials say they are barred by state law from discussing 
any companys record 
james candrell maintenance general foreman at the plant called 
the union officials hardnoses and contended pacific had the 
best safety program anybody had he called the explosion a freak 
accident 
greater loss of life was averted by hasty evacuation from the 
rocket fuel plant when a fire flared out of control 
but bill piper 34 a forklift operator at the kidd co 
marshmallow factory said the fire was burning at pacific 
engineering for quite some time before the explosions moments 
after he was told to leave the first explosion hit 
if wed been in there in the second blast forget it said 
piper who was critical of pacific for failing to warn its neighbor 
they underestimated what they had going there we could all 
have been killed he said 
the explosions sent a plume of acrid smoke high into the sky 
over the desert of southern nevada but it dissipated by nightfall 
wednesday and environmental protection agency officials determined 
thursday the site wasnt hazardous 
some shaken residents had abandoned their homes overnight 
pacific engineering is one of two plants that makes ammonium 
perchlorate an oxidizer that provides oxygen for burning fuel in 
the space shuttles solid rocket boosters and the minuteman and 
titan missiles 
the other company is kerrmcgee located just a mile away 
kerrmcgee manager patt corbett said plant operations were shut 
down after the pacific engineering explosions which ripped tiles 
from ceilings in the kerrmcgee buildings 
were trying to start back up he said adding employees 
were called to a thursday morning meeting to assure them their 
plant was safe 
the explosions were so strong they were picked up by earthquake 
monitoring equipment the most powerful of several explosions 
registered 35 on the richter scale said bob finn spokesman for 
the california institute of technology in pasadena calif

the snow lies nearly two feet deep 
under the fir trees around lake laflamme in the laurentian 
mountains but the pastoral scene masks one of canadas worst 
environmental hazards acid shock 
each spring as the snow melts airborne pollutants that 
accumulated over the winter in the boreal forest are flushed into 
the lakes of eastern canada causing up to 100 times the normal 
level of acidity and killing the fish 
lakes in quebec and elsewhere in canada are under siege 
federal environment minister tom mcmillan told reporters who 
traveled an hour north of quebec city to montmorency forest this 
week to observe the acid shock phenomenon at lake laflamme 
mcmillan said half the acid rain and snow falling there 
originates from us smokestack emissions and vehicle exhausts and 
he repeated canadas demand for us legislation to slash those 
emissions under a fixed timetable 
the offending sulfates and nitrates have killed all fish life in 
14000 canadian lakes and another 150000 lakes are being 
acidified he said 
its the north american continents no 1 environmental 
problem together we must act to defeat it if we dont it will 
defeat us the minister said 
prime minister brian mulroney made the same plea last month to 
president reagan and congress but won only a promise for more 
talks 
we didnt think it was going to be easy to convince a 
president who had attributed acid rain to trees and ducks and 
volcanoes said mcmillan 
the reagan administration argues that more causeandeffect 
research is needed before billions of dollars are spent on 
smokestack filters and scrubbers and other measures to curb the 32 
million metric tons a year of sulfur dioxide flowing across the 
border from the united states 
since 1980 a team of 40 canadian scientists has used lake 
laflamme as an acid shock laboratory to develop the worlds first 
computer model on the amount of acid pollution that can be 
anticipated during spring runoff 
but ironically the governmentorganized visit to the tiny 
remote lake underlined us reservations over canadas tough stand 
on acid rain 
for one thing the united states plans to spend far more money 
on acid rain research than canada 
reagan agreed in 1986 to ask congress for 25 billion us over 
five years to develop cleancoal technology with an equal amount 
coming from industry little has been appropriated thus far but it 
was a commitment 
in canada seven federal departments spend a total of just 18 
million 145 million us a year on acid rain 
mcmillan said this did not take provincial spending into account 
but added one of the problems in the united states is that 
research has become a buzzword for were not going to do anything 
about the problem itself 
mulroney and mcmillan often assert that acid rain is damaging 
canadas forests but claude godbout research director at the 
quebec ministry of energy and resources said there is no 
scientific proof of such damage 
thousands of dead trees along the road to lake laflamme fell 
prey to spruce budworm not acid rain godbout said theres been 
an epidemic since 1970 but there is some suspicion that acid rain 
weakened the trees 
mcmillan claimed the canadian maple syrup industry may collapse 
within 10 years because of maple die back in which acid rain is a 
major factor but godbout said high concentrations of ozone may 
cause more damage 
godbout nevertheless favored reductions in acid rain emissions 
he quoted the french philosopher pascals aphorism on the existence 
of god if heaven exists and i am a christian i win if i am not 
a christian i lose i cant take the gamble its the same with 
acid rain 
despite its high acidity lake laflamme still supports 2000 
brook trout scientists measure acidity and alkalinity on a ph 
scale from 0 to 14 with 7 representing neutrality and less than 7 
showing increased acidity lakes generally need a ph of 50 or 
above to sustain fish life 
the ph at lake laflamme dips to 39 during spring runoff and 
still supports life 
researchers explained that every lake is different and many 
factors are involved in destroying life including the degree of 
acid shock in springtime and the content and buffering ability of 
the nearby soil and lake bed

there are two main ways you can get aids first you can become 
infected by having sex oral anal or vaginal with someone who 
is infected with the aids virus 
second you can be infected by sharing drug needles and syringes 
with an infected person 
babies of women who have been infected with the aids virus may 
be born with the infection becuse it can be transmitted from the 
mother to the baby before or during birth 
in addition some persons with hemophilia and others have been 
infected by receiving blood

1 giving blood you are not now nor have you ever been in 
danger of getting aids from giving blood at a blood bank the 
needles that are used for blood donations are brandnew once they 
are used they are destroyed there is no way you can come into 
contact with the aids virus by donating blood 
2 receiving blood the risk of getting aids from a blood 
transfusion has been greatly reduced in the interest of making the 
blood supply as safe as possible donors are screened for risk 
factors and donated blood is tested for the aids antibody call 
your local blood bank if you have questions

the aids virus can be spread by sexual intercourse whether you 
are male or female heterosexual bisexual or homosexual 
this happens because a person infected with the aids virus may 
have the virus in semen or vaginal fluids the virus can enter the 
body through the vagina penis rectum or mouth 
anal intercourse with or without a condom is risky the rectum 
is easily injured during anal intercourse 
remember aids is sexually transmitted and the aids virus is 
not the only infection that is passed through intimate sexual 
contact 
other sexual transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea syphilis 
herpes and chlamydia can also be contracted through oral anal and 
vaginal intercourse if you are infected with one of these diseases 
and engage in risky behavior you are at greater risk of getting 
aids

dating and getting to know other people is a normal part of 
life dating doesnt mean the same thing as having sex sexual 
intercourse as a part of dating can be risky one of the risks is 
aids 
how can you tell if someone youre dating or would like to date 
has been exposed to the aids virus the bad news is you cant but 
the good news is as long as sexual activity and sharing drug 
needles are avoided it doesnt matter 
you are going to have to be careful about the person you become 
sexually involved with making your own decision based on your own 
best judgment that can be difficult 
has this person had any sexually transmitted diseases how many 
people have they been to bed with have they experimented with 
drugs all these are sensitive but important questions but you 
have a personal responsibility to ask 
think of it this way if you know someone well enough to have 
sex then you should be able to talk about aids if someone is 
unwilling to talk you shouldnt have sex

not so very long ago condoms rubbers or prophylactics were 
things we didnt talk about very much 
now theyre discussed on the evening news and on the front page 
of your newspaper and displayed out in the open in your local drug 
store grocery and convenience store 
for those who are sexually active and not limiting their sexual 
activity to one partner condoms have been shown to help prevent 
the spread of sexually transmitted diseases that is why the use of 
condoms is recommended to help reduce the spread of aids 
condoms are the best preventive measure against aids besides not 
having sex and practicing safe behavior 
but condoms are far from being foolproof you have to use them 
properly and you have to use them every time you have sex from 
start to finish if you use a condom you should remember these 
guidelines 
1 use condoms made of latex rubber latex serves as a barrier 
to the virus lambskin or natural membrane condoms are not 
as good because of the pores in the material look for the word 
latex on the package 
2 a condom with a spermicide may provide additional 
protection spermicides have been shown in laboratory tests to kill 
the virus use the spermicide in the tip and outside the condom 
3 condom use is safer with a lubricant check the list of 
ingredients on the back of the lubricant package to make sure the 
lubricant is waterbased do not use petroleumbased jelly cold 
cream baby oil or cooking shortening these can weaken the condom 
and cause it to break

it is very important that everyone understands that a person can 
be infected with the aids virus without showing any symptoms at all 
it is possible to be infected for years feel fine look fine 
and have no way of knowing you are infected unless you have a test 
for the aids virus 
during this period however people infected with the aids virus 
can pass the virus to sexual partners to people with whom drug 
needles are shared and to children before or during birth that is 
one of the most disturbing things about aids 
once symptoms do appear they are similar to the symptoms of 
some other diseases as the disease progresses they become more 
serious that is because the aids virus keeps your bodys natural 
defenses from operating correctly 
if you are concerned whether you might be infected consider 
your own behavior and its effects on others if you feel you need 
to be tested for the aids virus talk to a doctor or an aids 
counselor for more information see below

you have probably heard about the aids test the test 
doesnt actually tell you if you have aids it shows if you have 
been infected with the virus it looks for changes in blood that 
occur after you have been infected 
the public health service recommends you be confidentially 
counseled and tested if you have had any sexually transmitted 
disease or shared needles if you are a man who has had sex with 
another man or if you have had sex with a prostitute male or 
female you should be tested if you have had sex with anyone who 
has done any of these things 
if you are a woman who has been engaging in risky behavior and 
you plan to have a baby or are not using birth control you should 
be tested 
your doctor may advise you to be counseled and tested if you are 
a hemophiliac or have received a blood transfusion between 1978 
and 1985 
if you test positive and find you have been infected with the 
aids virus you must take steps to protect your partner 
people who have always practiced safe behavior do not need to be 
tested 
theres been a great deal in the press about problems with the 
test it is very reliable if it is done by a good laboratory and 
the results are checked by a physician or counselor 
if you have engaged in risky behavior speak frankly to a doctor 
who understands the aids problem or to an aids counselor 
for more nformation call your local public health agency 
theyre listed in the government section of your phone book or 
call your local aids hotline if you cant find the number call

today in some cities the sharing of drug needles and syringes 
by those who shoot drugs is the fastest growing way that the virus 
is being spread 
no one should shoot drugs it can result in addiction poor 
health family disruption emotional disturbances and death many 
drug users are addicted and need to enter a drug treatment program 
as quickly as possible 
in the meantime these people must avoid aids by not sharing any 
of the equipment used to prepare and inject illegal drugs 
sharing drug needles even once is an extremely easy way to be 
infected with the aids virus blood from an infected person can be 
trapped in the needle or syringe and then injected directly into 
the bloodstream of the next person who uses the needle 
other kinds of drugs including alcohol can also cause 
problems under their influence your judgment becomes impaired 
you could be exposed to the aids virus while doing things you 
wouldnt otherwise do 
teenagers are at an age when trying different things is 
especially inviting they must understand how serious the drug 
problem is and how to avoid it 
drugs are also one of the main ways in which prostitutes become 
infected they may share needles themselves or have sex with people 
who do they then can pass the aids virus to others 
for information about drug abuse treatment programs contact 
your physician local public health agency or community aids or 
drug assistance group

an infected woman can give the aids virus to her baby before it 
is born or during birth if a woman is infected her child has 
about one chance in two of being born with the virus 
if you are considering having a baby and think you might have 
been at risk of being infected with the aids virus even if it was 
years ago you should receive counseling and be tested before you 
get pregnant 
you must have a long talk with the person with whom youre 
planning to have a child even if you have known this person for a 
long time theres no way to be sure he or she hasnt been infected 
in the past possibly without realizing it that person needs to 
think hard and decide if an aids test might be a good idea so 
should you

children hear about aids just as we all do but they dont 
understand it so they become frightened they are worried they or 
their friends might get sick and die 
children need to be told they cant get aids from everyday 
contact in the classroom cafeteria or bathrooms they dont have 
to worry about getting aids even if one of their schoolmates is 
infected 
basic health education should be started as early as possible 
in keeping with parental and community standards local schools 
have the responsibility to see that their students know the facts 
about aids it is very important that middle school students 
those entering their teens learn to protect themselves from the 
aids virus 
children must also be taught values and responsibility as well 
as skills to help them resist peer pressure that might lead to 
risky behavior these skills can be reinforced by religious and 
community groups however final responsibility rests with the 
parents as a parent you should read and discuss this brochure 
with your children

who is infected you need to have a special understanding of the

becoming infected 
dont worry about getting aids from everyday contact with a 
person with aids you need to take precautions such as wearing 
rubber gloves only when blood is present

offer a helping hand become a volunteer you can be sure your help 
will be appreciated by a person with aids

the acquittal of mob boss anthony tony 
salerno on charges he helped rig the elections of teamster 
presidents roy williams and jackie presser strikes a crippling blow 
to government plans to take over the nations largest union law 
enforcement sources say 
salerno was convicted wednesday of racketeering in the 
construction industry but was acquitted with two other reputed mob 
figures on charges of fraud in williams and pressers elevations 
to the teamsters presidency in 1981 and 1982 
a federal law enforcement source speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the acquittal by a federal court jury in new york 
on the teamsterrelated counts is a serious setback 
in light of the verdict he said the government will have to 
conduct a major reevaluation of bringing a civil suit to oust 
presser and other top officials in the 16millionmember teamsters 
union and replace them with a courtappointed trustee 
the justice and labor departments a year ago began preparing the 
civil suit under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations 
rico act to wrest control of the teamsters from presser and its 
21member executive board 
government attorneys delayed filing the suit out of concern that 
it might prejudice the criminal prosecution of salerno and a belief 
that salernos conviction would enhance the case for taking control 
of the union through the rico statute 
john russell a justice department spokesman declined late 
wednesday to comment on the outcome of the salerno case 
teamster officials however said the verdict shatters once 
and forever the myth that pressers and williams elections had 
been engineered and manipulated by organized crime elements 
the fbi and the department of justice know that at this time 
no such influence exists said john r climaco the unions 
general counsel its a fiction pure fiction 
climaco said presser and other top union officials feel 
vindicated and are comforted by the fact that after over one 
year of testimony this jury was able to accurately ferret out the 
truth 
despite the setback in the salerno case some teamster 
officials speaking on the condition of anonymity said they still 
fear that rudolph giuliani the us attorney for manhattan will 
pursue a civil takeover attempt 
they have been extremely adamant and cocky the past 30 days 
about their intention to file this thing one union official 
said even this might not deter them 
the justice department used a similar suit under the rico law in 
1986 to place the 8000member teamsters local 560 in union city 
nj under the control of a courtappointed trustee 
the local one of the largest in the union had been under the 
control of convicted and now imprisoned mob figure anthony tony 
pro provenzano who has been liked to the stillunsolved 1975 
disappearance of former teamsters president jimmy hoffa 
however the governments takeover of local 560 lacked the 
political ramifications of its contemplated attempt to place an 
entire international union under the control of a courtappointed 
trustee 
when word of the anticipated suit was leaked by anonymous 
government sources last august the teamsters went on the 
offensive saying government takeovers of unions are nothing new 
communists have been doing it for years 
the aflcio which had ousted the teamsters on corruption 
charges in 1957 immediately came to their defense likening the 
suit to the soviet unions crushing of the solidarity labor 
movement in poland in 1981 
three months labor the teamsters were welcomed back into the 
aflcio in a move that the federations president lane kirkland 
said would not have happened had it not been for the contemplated 
takeover suit some aflcio leaders admitted the teamsters 
reaffiliation was a defensive move 
government prosecutors had acknowledged that if the suit against 
the teamsters succeeded their next targets were the laborers 
union the hotel and restaurant workers union and the international 
longshoremens association 
all three of those longtime aflcio affiliates along with the 
teamsters were identified in a 1985 report by a white house 
commission on organized crime as being under the control or 
influence of mob figures 
despite the salerno verdict the teamsters problems with the 
justice department are far from over 
presser is scheduled to go on trial july 12 in cleveland on 
charges of participating in a payroll padding scheme to embezzle 
700000 from a local there that he also heads 
his attorneys have acknowledged that two men with alleged 
organized crime connections were on the locals payroll while 
performing no work for the union but they said the fbi had 
acquiesced in and even encouraged the scheme and had used presser 
as a government informant for two decades

a series of thunderous explosions 
destroyed a space shuttle fuel plant and a candy factory wednesday 
generating a 5squaremile toxic cloud killing one person and 
injuring more than 250 authorities said 
it flipped cars over knocked pedestrians to the ground and 
windows in the whole town shattered said susan russo 37 of 
henderson who was outdoors when the first explosions occurred 
shortly before noon 
flames and orange smoke rose into the sky and buildings shook 
10 miles away in las vegas after the explosions at the pacific 
engineering amp production co in the southern nevada community of 
henderson 
fire chief roy parrish said a body was found wednesday night 
about 25 feet from the entrance to the fuel plant but all 12 
buildings leveled or severely damaged by the blasts had been 
searched and no other victims were found 
the logical conclusion is we wont find any more bodies 
parrish said everybody has been accounted for with the one 
deceased 
he said the fuel plant was evacuated seconds before the first 
explosion a move that may have saved many lives there was a 
small fire in the complex employees tried to put the fire out but 
it got out of control the supervisor then ordered the 
evacuation parrish said 
most of the employees had exited the building or were in the 
foothills around the plant when the first explosion occurred 
seconds later there was a second explosion that completely 
demolished the building parrish said 
hospitals reported treating more than 250 people at least four 
of them listed in critical condition most others had cuts and 
bruises from flying glass and debris others suffered burns broken 
bones or shock 
authorities initially said one person had died and relayed 
unconfirmed reports of nine deaths but official casualty reports 
fluctuated until midevening 
all roads to henderson a town of 54590 people midway between 
las vegas and hoover dam were closed emergency workers warned 
people away from the area as smoke billowed across the entire las 
vegas valley area schools were evacuated and united blood 
services of las vegas appealed for donations 
firefighters went housetohouse to evacuate 20 blocks of the 
housing development closest to the plant and another residential 
area in the western portion of the city where the toxic cloud 
formed 
most of hendersons other residents left voluntarily all 
residents were allowed back into their homes by 6 pm said gary 
bloomquist city manager for the community of more than 54000 
people 
two blasts which leveled the fuel plant and the kidd amp co 
marshmallow factory next door registered on earthquake 
seismographs 200 miles away at the california institute of 
technology in pasadena said spokesman bob finn 
the first blast at 1153 am measured about 30 on the 
richter scale of ground motion the second at 1157 am had a 
magnitude of 35 i find that absolutely amazing that is 
extremely powerful said finn 
we felt a little jolt said john conrad 62 a passenger 
aboard america west airlines flight 46 which flew over the plant 
about the time of the blasts there was a tall column of smoke 
going up 20000 feet 
joe hedrick 30 a worker at the fuel plant said he heard four 
explosions over several minutes with the fourth sounding the most 
powerful others reported three explosions 
the smoke was so thick it could choke you said a tearful 
hedrick who had cuts on his arms 
the fuel plant manufactures ammonium perchlorate an oxidizer 
used in fuel for the shuttles solid rocket boosters but nasa said 
the accident was not expected to delay resumption of shuttle 
flights 
the explosions followed a fire that began when one of our 
pieces of equipment malfunctioned pacific president fred gibson 
jr said the fire spread quickly and there was an explosion 
the blast ripped doors from their hinges broke windows and 
crumpled ceilings in homes in green valley two miles away said 
jack london spokesman at desert spring hospital in las vegas 
firefighters were unable to enter the site for nearly three 
hours after the explosions because of the threat of additional 
blasts and the toxic cloud 
two hundred people were believed to be at the fuel plant before 
the blasts and 25 to 35 people on duty at the candy plant few 
employees of either plant had been seen at hospitals authorities 
said 
the toxic cloud covering five square miles and moving to the 
northeast contained hydrochloric acid and it is very important 
that no one be within five miles of the smoke or fire said doug 
bradford a spokesman for the city of las vegas the strategy is 
to let it the plant fire burn 
more than 70 residents of the glen halla nursing home two miles 
from the blast were evacuated to the las vegas convention center 
after the explosion damaged their building officials said 
rick rieckmann 41 a welder was one of four pacific plant 
workers hurled through a wall in the first blast 
it blew us out of the building it sent us through a 
fiberglass wall and into the desert he said none of four was 
seriously hurt 
nasa said in washington that pacific engineering provides the 
ammonium perchlorate to morton thiokol nasas prime contractor for 
the motors as well as to some department of defense programs 
don amitor a spokesman for nasas marshall space flight center 
in huntsville ala said mortonthiokol had enough ammonium 
perchlorate in supply for the next five shuttle launches under the 
present schedule the fifth launch would be in mid1989 
pacific is one of two companies that supply ammonium perchlorate

como se adquiere el sida 
hay dos maneras principales como usted puede adquirir el sida 
primero usted puede infectarse por tener relaciones sexuales 
vaginales anales y tambien orales con alguien que esta 
infectado con el virus del sida 
segundo usted puede infectarse por compartir las agujas y 
jeringas para inyectarse drogas con una persona infectada 
tambien los bebes de mujeres infectadas con el virus del sida 
pueden nacer con la infeccion porque el virus puede ser 
transmitido por la sangre de la madre a la del bebe durante el 
embarazo o durante el parto algunas personas con hemofilia y otras 
que han recibido una transfusion de sangre se han infectado 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
puede usted infectarse 
si si usted sigue un comportamiento arriesgado 
los varones homosexuales fueron los primeros en sentir los 
efectos de la enfermedad en la nacion pero a pesar de lo que tal 
vez usted haya escuchado el numero de casos entre los 
heterosexuales sigue aumentando 
las personas que han muerto de sida en los eeuu han sido hombres 
y mujeres ricos y pobres anglos negros hispanos asiaticos y 
indios americanos

como se adquiere el sida por las relaciones sexuales 
el virus del sida puede se transmitido por el contacto seual ya 
sea usted hombre o mujer heterosexual bisexual u homosexual 
esto sucede porque una persona infectada con el virus del sida 
puede tener el virus en el semen o en los fluidos vaginales el 
virus puede entrar al cuerpo pr la vagina el pene el recto o la 
boca 
el contacto sexual anal con o sin condon es arriesgado el 
recto es lesionado facilmente durate el contacto sexual anal 
recuerde el sida es transmitido sexualmente y el virus del sida 
no es la unica infeccion que se transmite por el contacto sexual 
intimo 
otras enfermedades sexualmente transmisibles tales como la 
gonorrea sifilis herpes y clamidia pueden contraerse tambien por 
el contacto sexual oral anal o vaginal 
si usted esta infectado con alguna de estas enfermadades usted 
esta en alto riesgo de contraer el sida 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
usted no adquiere el sida aids por insectos ni por un beso 
no importa lo que usted haya escuchado el virus del sida sida 
es dificil de adquirir y facilmente se puede evitar 
usted no adquiere el sida como un resfriado o la gripe porque 
el virus es de un tipo diferente el virus del sida se transmite a 
traves del contacto sexual vaginal anal y tambien oral por 
compartir agujas para inyectarse drogas o a los bebes de madres 
infectadas durante el embarazo o durante el parto 
usted no adquiere el virus del sida por el contacto comun diario 
con la gente a su alrededor en la escuela en el tabajo en 
fiestas en guarderias infantiles o en supermercados usted no lo 
adquirere por nadar en una piscina aun cuando alguien que este 
nadando en la misma piscina este infectado con el virus del sida 
los estudiantes que asisten a la escuela con alguien infectado con 
el virus sida no estan en peligro por el contacto casual 
usted no adquiere el virus sida por la picadura de un mosquito 
el virus del sida no se transmite por las glandulas salivares del 
mosquito como otras emfermedades como la malaria paludismo o 
la fiebre amarilla usted no lo adquiere de los insectos de la 
cama piojos moscas u otros insectos 
usted no adquiere el virus del sida por la saliva sudor 
lagimas orima ni excrementos 
usted no adquiere el virus del sida por un beso 
el virus del sida no se adquiere del telefono la ropa ni del 
asiento de un inodoro excusado no puede transmitirse por usar un 
vaso o los utensilios para comer que alguien mas haya usado usted 
no adquiere el virus por estar en un autobus tren o elevador 
lleno de gente con una persona que esta infectada con el virus o

la diferencia entre donar y recibir sangre 
1 donar sangre usted no esta ahora ni ha estado nunca en 
peligo de adquirir el sida por donar sangre a un banco de sangre 
las agujas que se usan para las donaciones de sangre son nuevas 
una vez que se usan son destruidas no hay forma en que usted 
pueda entrar en contacto con el virus del sida por donar sangre 
2 recibir sangre el riesgo de adquirir el virus del sida por 
una transfusion de sangre ha sido reducido enormemente con el 
proposito de que el suministro de sangre sea lo mas seguro posible 
se investiga a los donadores para detectar probables factores de 
riesgo a la sangre donada se le hace la prueba de anticuerpos del 
sida si tiene alguna pregunta llame a su banco de sangre 
que clase de comportamiento lo pone a usted en riesgo 
usted tiene el riesgo de resultar infectado con el virus del 
sida si usted tiene relaciones sexuales con alguien que este 
infectado 
ya que usted no puede estar seguro de que alguien este 
infectado el riesgo de estar en contacto con el virus aumenta con 
el numero de companeros sexuales que usted tenga 
cualquier intercambio de sangre semen o fluidos vaginales 
infectados puede transmitir el virus y ponerlo a usted frente a un 
gran riesgo 
los siguientes comportamientos constituyen un riesgo cuando se 
practican con una persona infectada usted no puede saber a simple 
vista si una persona esta infectada 
comportamiento arriesgado 
compartir agujas y jeringas para inyectarse drogas 
contacto sexual anal con o sin condon contacto vaginal u oral 
con una persona infectada o con alquien ue se inyecte drogas o 
practique el sexo anal 
contacto con alguien que usted no conoce bien un encuentro 
casual o una persona que practique la prostitucion o con alguien 
que usted sabe que tiene varios companeros sexuales 
contacto sin proteccion sin condon con una persona infectada 
comportamiento seguro 
no tener relaciones sexuales 
tener relaciones sexuales con una sola persona que no este 
infectada y ser mutuamente fieles 
no inyectarse drogas 
y hablando de citas 
tener citas y concoer a otras personas es algo normal en la 
vida tener una cita no es lo mismo que tener relaciones sexuales 
el contacto sexual como parte de una cita puede ser arriesgado 
uno de los riesgos es el sida aids 
como puede usted saber si la persona con la que usted esta 
saliendo o le gustaria salir ha estado expuesta al virus del sida 
lo malo es que usted no puede saberlo pero lo bueno es que 
mientras evite las relaciones sexuales y no comparta las agujas 
para inyectarse las drogas no importa 
usted debe tener mucho cuidado con la persona con quien usted 
tenga relaciones sexuales haciendo su propia decision sobre la 
persona basandose en su buen juicio esto puede ser muy dificil 
ha tenido esta persona alguna enfermedad sexualmente 
transmisible con cuanta gente ha tenido relaciones sexuales ha 
experimentado con drogas 
todas estas preguntas son delicadas pero importantes pero 
usted tiene la responsabilidad personal de preguntar 
pienselo de esta manera si usted conoce a alguien lo suficiente 
como para tener relaciones sexuales entonces usted deberia hablar 
francamente del sida si alguien se niega a hablar del sida usted 
no deberia tener relaciones sexuales con esa persona 
pueden las personas casadas adquirir el sida 
las personas casadas que no estan infectadas que son fieles y 
que no se inyectan drogas no tienen ningun riesgo pero si siguen 
un comportamiento arriesgado vea la pagina 3 ellos podrian 
infectarse con el virus del sida e infectar a su pareja si usted 
cree que su conyuge pudiera estar poniendole en una situacion 
arriesgada hable con el o ella es su vida 
por que se habla tanto de los condones 
no hace mucho tiemo los condones hule la gomita o 
preservativo eran cosas de las que no hablabamos mucho 
ahora esto se discute en las noticias de la television o en la 
primer aplana de su periodico y los condones se exhiben libremente 
en su farmacia local supermercado o tienda 
para aquellos sexualmente activos que no limitan su actividad a 
una sola pareja se ha demostrado que el uso de los conones ayuda a 
prevenir la diseminacion de enfermedades sexualmente transmisibles 
por eso se recomienda el uso de los condones para ayudar a reducir 
la transmision del sida 
el uso de los condones es la mejor medida preventiva contra el 
sida fuera de no tener relaciones sexuales y de practicar un 
compartamiento seguro vea la pagina 3 
pero los condones no son absolutamente seguros usted debe de 
usarlos apropiadamente y usted debe usarlos cada vez que tenga 
relaciones sexuales desde el principio hasta el final si usted 
usa un condon debe seguir las siguientes recomendaciones 
1 use condones hechos de latex ya que el latex sirve como una 
barrera para el virus los condones lambskin o natural 
membrane no son tan buenos por los poros en el material busque 
la palabra latex en el empaque 
2 un condon con un espermicida puede proporcionarle proteccion 
adicional se ha demostrado en pruebas de laboratorio que los 
espericidas matan el virus del sida use el espermicida en el 
interior de la punta y en el exterior del condon 
3 el uso del condon es mas seguro con un lubricante revise la 
lista de ingredientes en la parte posterior del empaque del 
lubricante para estar seguro de que tenga base de agua 
waterbased no use lubricantes con base de petroleo cold cream 
aceite para bebes o manteca vegetal para cocinar estos pueden 
debilitar el condon y ser la causa de que se rompa 
como luce una persona con sida 
es muy importante que todos entiendan que una persona puede 
estar infectada con el virus del sida aids y no mostrar ningun 
sintoma 
es posible estar infectado por anos sentirse bien lucir bien y 
no tener manera de saber que usted esta infectado a menos que a 
usted le hagan una prueba para el virus del sida 
este periodo en que uno esta infectado sin saberlo es una de las 
cosas que mas preocupan del sida durante este periodo sin 
embargo las personas infectadas con el virus del sida pueden 
transmitir el virus a sus companeros sexuales y a la gente con 
quien comparten las agujas para inyectarse drogas las madres 
infectadas pueden transmitirlo a sus hijos durante el embarazo o 
durante el parto 
una vez que se presentan los sintromas estos son similares a 
los de algunas otras enfermedades mientras la enfermedad progresa 
los sintomas se vuelven mas serios porque el virus del sida no 
permite a las defensas naturales de su cuerpo funcionar 
correctamente 
si a usted le precoupa seriamente la posibilidad de estar 
infectado usted tiene que pensar que su comportamiento puede 
afectar a otros si usted cree que deberia hacerse una prueba de 
sangre para el virus del sida consulte a un doctor o a un 
consejero del sida para mas informacion lea abajo 
hay una cura para el sida 
actualmente no hay cura para el sida 
las medicinas tales como azt han prolongado la vida de alguna 
gente con sida existe la esperanza de que se desarrollen nuevos 
tratamientos 
tampoco existe una vacuna para prevenir la infeccion en gente 
que no esta infectada los investigadores creen que pasaran anos 
antes de que se descubra una vacuna segura y eficaz 
la manera mas eficaz para prevenir el sida es no exponerse al 
virus cosa que usted puede controlar con su propio comportamiento

the nations biggest junk bond underwriter has 
had a change of heart about its practice of letting employees buy 
into its own deals one week after being accused in congress of 
favoring them over its customers 
drexel burnham lambert inc announced wednesday that employees 
and partnerships formed by employees will no longer be permitted to 
purchase new issues of bonds underwritten by the firm 
the investigations subcommittee of the house energy and commerce 
committee in hearings last week released documents showing drexel 
employees reaped huge profits by purchasing bonds underwritten by 
the firm and then quickly reselling them in one case within 17 
days 
employees were permitted to buy bonds during initial offerings 
of muchsought issues even when the practice denied bonds to 
public customers the documents showed 
drexel was instrumental in developing the market for the 
highyield highrisk junk bonds which allow companies without a 
track record of earnings to obtain financing based on whether they 
have sufficient cash flow to pay off their debts junk bonds have 
been frequently used in corporate raiding 
of the 32 billion in junk bonds issued in 1986 40 percent were 
underwritten by drexel according to a congressional report 
drexel chief executive frederick joseph in a letter to rep 
john dingell dmich chairman of both the committee and 
subcommittee stuck by his assertions that the employee purchases 
were proper but said the firm was worried about appearances 
i indicated we supported such purchases nonetheless public 
perception is important to financial institutions such as ours and 
we recognize that even the best of motives can be misunderstood 
he said 
rep ron wyden dore a member of the subcommittee said 
drexels letter leaves a number of questions unanswered including 
whether drexel will be able to trade for its own accounts and pass 
profits on to employees in the form of bonuses 
he said he would also like to know if employee accounts will be 
able to trade in the secondary market which is heavily influenced 
by the underwriting firm 
steven anreder a spokesman for drexel said the firm had no 
comment beyond its brief announcement 
dingell in a statement released by an aide called drexels 
decision a very good step adding it should lay to rest 
questions associated with the fairness and legality of that 
particular practice 
however the aide dennis fitzgibbons said dingell has made no 
decision regarding his committees ongoing investigation of drexel 
dingell has been criticized by rep thomas bliley rva for 
subpoenaing michael milken chief of drexels junk bond unit to 
appear before the committee even though milken had indicated in 
advance he would refuse to testify based on his constitutional 
protection from selfincrimination 
when he refused to testify milken confirmed he is under 
investigation by a federal grand jury in new york which is 
reported to be looking into insider trading allegations 
dingell said the firms retreat on employee purchases 
indicates that the behavior of the committee was correct and fair 
in bringing these matters to light 
junk bonds pay higher interest rates than those issued by 
established companies and are considered riskier investments they 
have been used by corporate raiders to finance unfriendly takeover 
attempts

transmitir el virus a sus companneros sexuales y a la gente con 
quien comparten las agujas para inyectarse drogas las madres 
infectadas pueden transmitirlo a sus hijos durante el embarazo o

una vez que se presentan los siintromas estos son similares a 
los de algunas otras enfermedades mientras la enfermedad progresa 
los siintomas se vuelven mas serios porque el virus del sida no 
permite a las defensas naturales de su cuerpo funcionar

actualmente no hay cura para el sida 
las medicinas tales como azt han prolongado la vida de alguna 
gente con sida existe la esperanza de que se desarrollen nuevos 
tratamientos 
tampoco existe una vacuna para prevenir la infeccioon en gente 
que no estaa infectada los investigadores creen que pasaraan annos 
antes de que se descubra una vacuna segura y eficaz 
la manera maas eficaz para prevenir el sida es no exponerse al 
virus cosa que usted puede controlar con su propio comportamiento

when joseph pulitzer jr was an 
undergraduate at harvard university in 1935 he bought a striking 
painting by modigliani beginning an extraordinary collection of 
modern art 
the collection grew to more than 250 paintings drawings and 
sculptures in the ensuing halfcentury pulitzer recently returned 
to harvard for the opening of an exhibit featuring 86 of his those 
works 
more than 40 artists are represented in the exhibit which will 
be at harvards fogg museum until june 12 when it moves to the 
saint louis art museum in missouri from july 8 through aug 28 
there are perhaps only three or four museums in the country 
who could put together from their own collections a display to 
match the depth and breadth of this one said edgar peters 
bowron director of the harvard university art museums 
included are 12 works by picasso four each by monet klee and 
miro three each by degas matisse lipchitz and lichtenstein and 
pieces by cezanne brancusi pollock and warhol 
i wanted to buy creative art that would have a validity and 
vitality that would transcend fashion said pulitzer whose 
grandfathers will established the pulitzer prizes in journalism 
and the arts 
i was much more interested in the living rather than going 
deeply into the past he said explaining why he chose to collect 
modern art 
a fine arts major at harvard pulitzer graduated in 1936 and 
joined the staff of the st louis postdispatch he became its 
editor and publisher and now is chairman of the pulitzer publishing 
co 
he has been generous with his purchases giving pieces to 
museums including the fogg and the saint louis art museum which 
has that first modigliani elvira resting at a table some 
remain at his home 
joe started collecting from the purest of reasons love of 
art said michael shapiro chief curator of the saint louis art 
museum 
and hes not cashing in his chips shapiro added referring 
to collectors who sell for profit 
shapiro bowron and judith weisslevy curator of prints 
drawings and photographs at the saint louis museum made the 
selections from the pulitzer collection to put in the exhibit 
it was intended to demonstrate the quality and range of the 
collection bowron said of their choices and noted that pulitzer 
also had a say 
we made the initial selection but then joe with his unerring 
eye said you must put in this one and that one bowron said 
installing the exhibit was difficult because the works were so 
varied in size media and style 
one perspective on the exhibit said shapiro is that pulitzer 
bought the modigliani four years before richard serra who has a 
painting a drawing and a sculpture in the show was born 
the collection is very much a synopsis of mainstream modernism 
and its evolving shapiro said 
in a certain sense we distilled them the selections out of 
joes distillation a summary history of modern art in europe and 
america it is a history of modern art 
the exhibit also marks the publication by the harvard university 
art museums of the fourth volume of the catalog of the pulitzer 
collection 
it was written by angelica zander rudenstine a curator and 
scholar and as a member of the visiting committee an adviser to 
harvards fine arts department 
i have said to angelica if she ever departs from her 
profession as art historian i would like to hire her for the st 
louis postdispatch as an investigative reporter pulitzer said

the number of parttime college students in the 
average freshman class has increased 73 percent during the 1980s 
but total freshman enrollment has declined by a similar amount a 
survey shows 
the major exception to that trend private doctoral 
degreegranting universities where average parttime rolls plunged 
321 percent while freshman enrollments have risen 4 percent 
an annual report from the college board summary statistics 
annual survey of colleges 198788 included average enrollment 
data on 3134 institutions of higher education 
the survey shows that from 1980 to 1986 
the average freshman class at all kinds of institutions was 
down 74 percent 942 students to 872 twoyear public technical 
colleges experienced the biggest declines 198 percent on average 
964 students to 773 
the average institution had 1489 parttime students in 1986 
73 percent more than the 1388student average in 1980 leading 
the way were twoyear public technical colleges where average 
parttime rolls were up 247 percent from 1047 to 1306 
fulltime freshman rolls shrank 24 percent at all 
institutions and the biggest drop was at twoyear technical 
schools where the average freshman class shrank by 119 percent 
from 1264 to 1114 
minority freshman rolls at fouryear private universities rose 
15 percent the biggest increase of any kind of institution 
overall minority enrollments rose from 154 percent to 158 
percent of freshman attending all institutions 
the average number of applications to freshman classes at all 
fouryear institutions increased 63 percent the biggest average 
gains were 115 percent at public doctoral granting universities 
and 105 percent at private liberal arts colleges 
the sharp gain in parttimers results at least partly from 
aggressive marketing by colleges to attract older students said 
college board spokeswoman janice gams 
those increases have softened the impact of enrollment declines 
in the number of 18yearolds that trend is not expected to 
reverse itself until the mid1990s she said 
the college board is a nonprofit educational association whose 
members include more than 2500 secondary and higher education 
institutions

when chester wells closed his failing 
robotics firm in chicago he never imagined that six months later 
he would be making plows and harnesses in the african bush as a 
us peace corps volunteer 
for a man my age opportunities were limited and i was 
disillusioned said the 66yearold electrical engineer but i 
was not ready to retire i had too much to offer 
two years after arriving in this east african nation wells is 
working to open a training center to mass produce inexpensive plows 
and harnesses for peasant farmers with usgovernment money and 
land donated by the kenyan government 
he expects to open the mutomo community technical center by 
january with an class of 100 students 
the kenya rural enterprises program gave wells nearly 300000 
to build the center and the kenyan government donated a sevenacre 
site the enterprises program is financed by the us agency for 
international development usaid through world education inc of 
boston to help set up small businesses in rural areas 
wells who comes from park ridge ill left marquette 
university in milwaukee wis in 1951 with a bachelors degree in 
electrical engineering he worked as a design engineer managed a 
computer chips manufacturing company and helped various companies 
automate their operations before establishing his own company 
wells automation products in chicago in 1983 
he closed the business in january 1986 when the economy turned 
sour 
wells a widower said the children had gone their seperate 
ways so he decided to strike out on his own 
he joined the peace corps an organization usually staffed by 
people a third his age 
wells was sent to kenya in july 1986 and eventually wound up 
in mutomo a market town of fewer than 1000 people 140 miles 
southeast of the capital nairobi there the danish international 
development agency had asked other donor governments to help find 
someone to run a small operation making harnesses and plows 
i wondered what a man trained in electronics and used to big 
plants would do here recalled wells a stocky balding man 
he spent 10 weeks at the lakeside town of naivasha for 
orientation before coming to mutomo about 18 months ago he found 
workers turning out crude plows and harnesses by hand 
i was astounded he said the men sat on dirt floors 
hacking away at wood with pangas machetes and producing beautiful 
frames for harnesses 
he intends to introduce shop tools and power tools to the 
process so the men can make more harnesses and plows at a faster 
rate 
days are hot and nights chilly in mutomo which sits in the 
middle of scrubland rock outcrops and gulleys left by torrential 
rains that come twice a year 
peasants of the kamba tribe mainly women and children because 
men seek fortunes elsewhere try to grow corn sorghum and millet 
they also graze goats and cattle and keep donkeys 
but they lack affordable tools particularly plows 
wells pushed the idea for a training center writing proposals 
and seeking money 
josephat muliungi development coordinator for the kitui roman 
catholic diocese said the center will be the largest economic 
enterprise in mutomo 
the area is one of kenyas poorest average income for a peasant 
farm family is less than 100 a year 
once the students are gainfully employed we expect a sizeable 
increase in income for at least 1000 families within a year 
muliungi said 
wells said the center will continue making harnesses and plows 
but in larger quantities and better quality he hopes to reduce the 
price of a plow from the current 450 shillings 2650 
only 20 of the 100 students will remain at the center after the 
yearlong training the others will be organized into groups given 
a little money and sent out to make and repair plows and harnesses 
in the villages around mutomo 
the center will continue to offer advise on how to run simple 
businesses 
wells already is looking to expand production to include hand 
tools bicycles carts and solarpowered radios 
people say it cannot be done he said but i think it can 
be done it is possible 
wells whose peace corps stint has been extended by a year said 
the center can be duplicated in other parts of kenya and wants to 
stay after his peace corps time is up 
it is a beautiful thing what im doing here he said and 
its good for people like me 
im young again im thinking again

geneva chowdhury jealously guards the 
water stored in pots and pans in her house in a middleclass 
neighborhood she hasnt had a bath in more than a week and wont 
allow her husband and two daughters to use more than one bucket of 
water a day 
i have rationed water i do not want to be caught in a 
situation where there will not be enough left to drink mrs 
chowdhury said 
the 55yearold housewife is one of hundreds of thousands of 
residents facing an unprecedented water crisis in the indian 
capital 
lack of freeflowing water in many parts of new delhi has 
triggered demonstrations in the streets brawls over the occasional 
dribbles at public taps and debates in parliament 
in best of time there is not enough water for all of us in 
new delhi but what we are experiencing now is beyond 
comprehension said mrs chowdhury whose chitta ranjan park 
neighborhood of 16000 people has been without running water since 
april 25 
new delhis 8 million residents need at least 472 million 
gallons of water daily officials say but drought conditions in 
neighboring states low river levels and a dispute on watersharing 
rights have slashed the supply in half for the past week 
some neighborhoods are completely without water while others 
mainly upperclass areas are virtually unaffected in other 
areas people say they are getting 10 percent to 30 percent of 
their usual supply 
new delhis water crisis finally brought home what has been 
happening in other states since last years monsoon rains failed 
sixteen of indias 25 states were declared droughtaffected last 
year leading to crop failures starving livestock and hardships 
for poor villagers 
devout hindus in the city are offering special prayers to the 
rain god indra and the sea god varuna 
when man fails the only way left is to turn to the gods 
said ramrati ram a housewife in the congested mehrauli district 
where water taps are either dry or emit only thin trickles for an 
hour a day 
during last sundays full moon mrs ram joined dozens of women 
who walked to the yamuna river new delhis main source of water 
and threw coconuts in the shallow water as offerings to indra and 
varuna 
the river emerges from glaciers in the himalayan foothills and 
flows down the plains through utter pradesh and haryana states 
before reaching new delhi 
coconuts are auspicious symbols in the hindu faith and the 
women hoped their offerings would please the water gods 
the drought dragon has traveled to the capital city we feel 
the fire said santanu mohan a sales executive in new delhis 
fivestar ashoka hotel 
some luxury hotels including the ashoka have asked their 
guests to conserve water 
the water shortage has also hit the citys hospitals but no 
emergencies have been reported 
things are improving but still there is shortage said ss 
ramrakhiani chief engineer of delhi water supply and sewage 
disposal undertaking water is not something that you can churn 
out of a factory 
opposition members of parliament have accused the government of 
inefficient water management but neelam kapur spokeswoman for the 
ministry of water resources denied the allegation 
we are getting emergency supply from haryana state and things 
are not that bad she said 
the drought has forced the haryana state government to regulate 
the yamunas flow which public works officials are monitoring from 
helicopters 
the haryana government says it did not reduce the flow but only 
diverted water through a longer canal route to enable farmers to 
irrigate their lands 
as a result more farmers are using the water from the river and 
the amount reaching new delhi is reduced 
haryana has agreed to channel the river water back into the 
shorter route but only until may 16 
god willing it may rain before that said ramrakhiani

president najib former secret police 
commander is trying to polish his image abroad as he loses the 
soviet military might that has propped up afghanistans marxist 
government for the past decade 
his sales pitch for financial aid and political sympathy is 
aimed in three directions 
the united states which has been arming the moslem 
fundamentalist guerrillas fighting the afghan army 
india the strongest power in the asian subcontinent which 
shares afghan animosity toward pakistan 
islamic nations which have given lip service but little in the 
way of arms and money to the guerrillas known as mujahedeen or 
islamic holy warriors 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 and have been 
helping najibs government fight the usbacked guerrillas the 
soviet union agreed april 14 in geneva to begin withdrawing its 
estimated 115000 troops on may 15 
najibs appeal to the united states became most pronounced last 
week when he addressed a group of private american citizens and 
soviet academicians at the end of their weeklong conference on 
afghanistan 
while stressing his governments commitments of friendship with 
the neighboring soviet union najib professed an eagerness for 
political economic cultural and even military ties with the 
united states 
he also played on iranianus enmity comparing the 
fundamentalism of the mujahedeen to that of ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeinis regime in iran which borders afghanistan on the west 
what would be the consequences of the emergence of another 
iran in the region today najib asked his american visitors 
he played down commitments to socialism and emphasized what he 
called his governments encouragement of the private sector he 
invited the united states and its corporations to invest in 
afghanistan 
his economic pragmatism was an open acknowledgement that the 
communism or socialism espoused by his predecessors is doomed among 
his fiercely individualistic and capitalistic countrymen 
kabul moneychangers operate openly soliciting dollars and 
offering exchange rates more than three times the official rate 
cocacola is still the most popular soft drink the bottle looks 
like the real thing but the contents dont taste like it 
the burly najib former head of khad the kgbstyle security 
police also seemed to be seeking a gentler personal image 
towering over 6 feet and aften described as a bear bull 
or ox of a man he spoke more softly than he had in the past 
his eyes crinkled with smile wrinkles as he beamed at his listeners 
reshaping his image however will require other efforts 
according to western diplomatic sources the rate of executions has 
been increasing at pulicharki prison a circular complex on the 
outskirts of kabul 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said hundreds 
of inmates mostly mujahedeen have been executed in the last three 
months the sources said pakistani and iranian prisoners were 
beaten daily at pulicharki 
the 41yearold najib also has been courting india which like 
afghanistan is wary of a potentially powerful pakistan 
pakistan wedged between india and afghanistan has sheltered 
mujahedeen guerrillas and serves as their conduit for weapons 
supplied by the united states china and other nations 
najib arrived in new delhi on wednesday for a threeday state 
visit his first foreign trip since the signing of the geneva 
agreement 
at an april 27 sports festival celebrating the 10th anniversary 
of the afghan revolution the seat of honor next to najib was 
occupied by sunil dutt an indian movie star and member of 
parliament from prime minister rajiv gandhis congress party 
dutt later observed admiringly that najib knows how to be 
president 
india which is a founding member of the nonaligned movement and 
has a friendship treaty with the soviet union has been supportive 
of najibs government against the pakistanibased mujahedeen 
najib also has taken pains to portray himself as a champion of 
islam a change from his predecessors policies 
government officials when asked their priorities routinely 
mention reconstruction of the mosques first ahead of repatriation 
of refugees and rebuilding the economy turbaned clergymen are 
included in official delegations presented to foreign visitors and 
stops on governmentorganized tours include historic mosques 
najib himself was called najibullah at birth but he dropped the 
ullah a form of allah meaning god in 1986 when he 
replaced babrak karmal as general secretary of the peoples 
democratic party of afghanistan 
now however he is again referred to as najibullah by his 
underlings and the governmentrun news media

four years have passed since jesse 
jackson came to call on jobless coal miner karnell bryant since 
then the bryant family has started to leave the hard times behind 
but not their enthusiasm for jackson 
i voted for him in 1984 and im surely going to do so this 
time says bryants wife diane 
west virginias primary is tuesday and jackson along with the 
other candidates is campaigning in the state next week again he 
will pay a visit to a coal miners home this time in raleigh 
county 
during the 1984 presidential campaign jacksons visit with the 
bryants at their home at mudfork in logan county garnered national 
attention and gave a glimpse of the coalition of economically 
struggling americans both black and white that jackson was 
beginning to build 
at the time bryant was eking out a living in the depressed 
coalfields from occasional carpentry jobs he had met jackson 
nearly 20 years earlier when he was driven to chicago by tough 
economic times in his native state 
i went there because you couldnt get crackers in west 
virginia bryant said this week times was really hard here 
with the coal economy so down 
in chicago bryant was living in one of the numerous appalachian 
ghettos that sprang up when west virginians and others fled to 
urban areas to look for work 
there was a lot of poor white people a real raggedy area 
he said and i wasnt doing too hot either i was just a big ol 
knotheaded boy working as a janitor so i guess i was one of the 
people who was underprivileged 
though he may have considered himself underprivileged bryant 
still had time and energy to devote to people who were even less 
fortunate he went to work as a volunteer in a food pantry and 
when the pantry needed additional support he contacted jacksons 
operation push 
i worked around him and with him and i got to admire the 
guy bryant said he wasnt working for no personal gain just 
to help people 
these days the bryants are better off financially than they 
were during jacksons 1984 visit about 3 years ago they 
mortgaged their home and property to buy the store where mrs 
bryant worked as a butcher and now they run the wilcox grocery 
they work 12 hours a day six days a week jackson likes to say 
in his stump speech that many of americas poor people work hard 
every day 
the business is growing by leaps and bounds mrs bryant 
said were doing real good with the grace of god 
but bryant doesnt want to forget the hard times 
were blessed so we can be a blessing to other people thats 
how i look at it bryant said it seems like the people that 
has the money dont care about god country or human beings they 
just care about getting richer 
bryant said his support for jackson goes beyond a personal 
fondness for the man 
im getting a little bit disillusioned with our government and 
the way its been run he said if you ever ask a question 
seems like our government wants to say youre just a communist or 
a rebel or a redneck 
thats what attracted him to jackson bryant said 
jesse jackson dont believe in diplomacy he believes in 
honesty he said theres a spirit about the man that makes you 
want to be more like him 
what i like about the guy is hes specific and to the point 
bryant added and he dont believe in babying people if youre 
wrong youre wrong 
diane bryant agreed 
i think jesse is the only one who can do the job he has the 
ability and hes an honest person she said 
you know full well we already have too many crooks in 
government

the ghost of extremeright candidate jeanmarie le 
pen haunts the presidential campaign trail bedeviling conservative 
premier jacques chirac and like a poltergeist forcing cracks in 
his centerright coalition 
le pen who ran on an antiimmigration french first 
platform was eliminated in the first round of the election april 
24 but he won a surprising 144 percent of the vote and placed 
fourth 
now chirac and socialist president francois mitterrand the 
top two votegetters who advanced to sundays runoff are making 
overtures to le pen supporters 
chiracs rally for the republic party took its deepest swing 
into le pen territory last weekend when interior minister charles 
pasqua said le pens national front claims the same 
preoccupations the same values as the traditional conservative 
parties 
chirac placed a weak second with just under 20 percent of the 
april 24 vote he needs to win over supporters of the national 
front without distancing centrist voters who backed former premier 
raymond barre who came in third and was eliminated from the runoff 
mitterrand favored in sundays election also needs support 
from le pens voters if his image as a uniting force in a divided 
france is to be credible 
but pasquas remarks in an interview with the weekly valeurs 
actuelles unsettled the french political world 
some of chiracs other ministers demanded an explanation while 
a top national front official said pasqua would be welcome to join 
up 
the premier himself said the attention to pasquas statement was 
a maneuver invented by the left to mask the real debate 
economic competitiveness 
europe is in the making chirac said in a tuesday night 
television interview in reference to 1992 when trade barriers will 
dissolve he said talk should be focused on redressing the economy 
not on an abstract debate on values 
but the premier clearly has taken on the language of the 
national front he has used its favorite words family country 
national identity and even uses le pens preferred word 
decadence when referring to the left 
mitterrand has said he will not pursue a witchhunt of 
immigrants but has begun saying that immigration to france should 
be cut 
while making such subtle appeals to the national front he has 
sought the support of wayward centrists and moved the socialist 
program toward the political center 
we dont have the right to refuse any help offered honestly 
it is in union not separation that france will achieve its 
destiny mitterrand said this week at a rally in strasbourg 
because of le pens strong showing many french are worried 
about a rise in racism fascism and undemocratic values 
some centrists who have supported chiracs government have been 
unnerved by the open flirtation with le pen dozens who supported 
barre in the first round have announced support for mitterrand 
most are obscure political figures but four served as conservative 
cabinet ministers in the 1970s 
jacques chirac is caught between the devil and the deep blue 
sea socialist sen roger quillot said tuesday night if he 
moves toward le pen he loses from barres side if he moves too 
close to barre he loses from le pens side 
mitterrand is widely expected to lure other centrists into the 
government he will form if he wins the election 
analysts have attributed much of le pens support to a protest 
vote by people outside the economic and political mainstream 
le pen contends that france inundated with immigrants notably 
from its former north african colonies is in decline growing 
decadent and in danger of losing its identity he says france busy 
providing for immigrants has forgotten to take care of its own 
at a may 1 rally in paris tuileries gardens le pen called on 
about 30000 supporters not to vote for mitterrand he asked them 
to use their own judgment on a vote for chirac or not vote at all 
he vowed to stay active and called on followers to organize for 
municipal elections next spring

happen if the earth were invaded by a power from outer space 
and imagines that it would unite all nations of the world in a 
common defense 
he made the comment wednesday in chicago during a 
questionandanswer session after a speech about human rights and 
the soviet union 
his telling of the story followed one day after the disclosure 
that nancy reagan has consulted an astrologer about the presidents 
schedule and travel plans several members of congress chided 
reagan about the use of astrology and a group of scientists 
complained that it was a discredited practice 
reagan asked what he felt was the most vital factor in 
international relations spoke of the importance of frankness and 
about a desire for peaceful solutions 
he went on to say that there had been about 114 wars since 
world war ii including conflicts between smaller nations 
but ive often wondered what if all of us in the world 
discovered that we were threatened by an outer a power from outer 
space from another planet reagan said 
wouldnt we all of a sudden find that we didnt have any 
differences between us at all we were all human beings citizens 
of the world and wouldnt we come together to fight that 
particular threat the president asked 
the president found an analogy in the threat of nuclear 
destruction 
in a way we have something of that kind today mentioning 
nuclear power again we now have a weapon that can destroy the 
world and why dont we recognize that threat more clearly and then 
come together with one aim in mind how safely sanely and quickly 
can we rid the world of this threat to our civilization and our 
existence 
the comment drew applause from the audience a nonpartisan group 
that specializes in foreign policy and national security issues 
the national strategy forum 
as his next summit with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
approaches reagan has been emphasizing the need for arms control 
in particular and for cooperation among nations in general 
in light of his past antisoviet rhetoric he offered startling 
praise for gorbachev during his speech wednesday saying the soviet 
leaders reform programs are of tremendous significance 
it is my belief that there is hope for further change hope 
that in the days ahead the soviets will grant further recognition 
to the fundamental civil and political rights of all reagan said

the federal trade commission is under orders 
from a house panel to investigate whether the tobacco industry is 
waging an illegal scorched earth campaign of economic 
retaliation against corporate opponents of smoking 
rep thomas a luken dohio chairman of a house energy and 
commerce subcommittee instructed ftc chairman daniel oliver at a 
hearing wednesday to examine whether tobacco companies are engaged 
in illegal boycotts whether real or threatened against 
businesses that prohibit smoking 
luken referred to rjr nabisco inc which fired the advertising 
firm that handled the announcement by another client northwest 
airlines that it would prohibit smoking on all domestic flights 
except to hawaii starting april 23 
the ad firm saatchi amp saatchi dfs inc had been producing ads 
for nabisco cookies for 12 years and for life savers candy another 
product of the tobacco and food conglomerate for 18 years rjr 
nabisco cited philosophical differences in firing the agency 
the scorched earth efforts by conglomeration tobacco companies 
to hit back at those who restrict smoking and to use the economic 
power of their nontobacco components to effort their will are 
chilling and depressing luken said 
if the parent companies with tobacco and nontobacco 
subsidiaries use tactics of intimidation and threats against those 
who oppose smoking the ftc should be alerted he said it is 
the ftcs job to be aware of boycotts whether real or threatened 
and to examine their legality 
charles o whitley a senior consultant for the tobacco 
institute the industrys trade association said there is no 
evidence of any collusion among the six major tobacco 
manufacturers to take economic reprisals against northwest airlines 
or any other business 
but whitley said tobacco companies will take any lawful steps 
necessary to protect themselves and their customers against 
corporate discrimination 
whitley said the tobacco institute had not taken a position on 
draft legislation proposed by luken and rep bob whittaker rkan 
to allow states to require tougher health warnings on cigarette 
packs and advertising than those required under federal law 
major health organizations including the american lung 
association the american cancer society and the american heart 
association endorsed the measure at the hearing 
their spokesmen accused the tobacco industry of making false 
advertising claims that lowtar cigarettes are safer to smoke than 
others the only safe cigarette is no cigarette said scott d 
ballin vice president of the heart association 
the lukenwhittaker bill also would allow smokers and their 
families to sue tobacco companies for damages on the ground that 
deceptive cigarette advertising resulted in serious injury or death 
the measure seeks to nullify recent appeals court rulings 
favoring cigarette manufacturers who argued that 
governmentrequired warning labels protect them from legal claims 
that they failed to warn the public of the hazards of smoking 
the bill would require the federal trade commission to contract 
with a government or private laboratory unrelated to the tobacco 
industry to conduct annual studies of the chemicals contained in 
major cigarette brands including tar nicotine carbon monoxide 
ammonia cyanide formaldehyde and radioactive compounds 
the ftc closed its cigarettetesting laboratory in february 1987 
on budgetary grounds the only testing is performed by a tobacco 
industry laboratory which is monitored by the ftc and uses 
ftcapproved methods

an unlikely combination of mariachi music 
searchlights and the overhead drone of the goodyear blimp lured the 
last of thousands of aliens to the nations busiest immigration 
amnesty application center 
but a line of aliens that in the past few weeks had numbered in 
the thousands dwindled to only a few dozen wednesday night 
still hundreds of people merely wanting to watch the scene 
gathered in the adjacent parking lot and a steady stream of cars 
clogged traffic along the street just north of downtown 
with los arrieros a sixmember mariachi band playing 
hispanic music in the background richard rios director of the 
immigration and naturalization services amnesty center earlier 
surveyed the line of aliens 
it may be a 6000 day he said simply 
in the 12 months since the program began the houston office 
became the nations busiest single center with applications 
expected to top 110000 officials said 
one of the last minute applicants was maria flores who used the 
trunk of a car to fill out applications for two of her five 
children she already has submitted applications for her other 
children and husband 
we waited until now because we didnt have the money she 
said of the 50 fee for children and 185 for adults a 420 
ceiling was set for families 
she decided to take advantage of the amnesty program for the 
advantages of being an american citizen 
mexicos economy is so bad its so expensive and at least 
here we can make enough money for food and a decent living said 
mrs flores who has been in this country since 1979 
overhead the houstonbased goodyear blimp circled its lighted 
sign proclaiming in spanish and english time is growing short 
a searchlight pierced the dark sky 
entrepreneurs sold refreshments and portable toilets were set up 
to accommodate people who had camped out overnight 
i kept saying tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow said 24yearold 
florentino montiel explaining why he waited until the last day 
some attorneys conspicuous in their suits and other volunteers 
were seated at card tables outside the center helping applicants 
fill out the ins forms a spanishlanguage radio station broadcast 
live while an artist sketched pictures of applicants 
even police officers directing the traffic helped aliens having 
problems with the forms 
i brought my father down here officer joe garcia jr said 
pointing to a man working with aliens at a table outside the center 
many ins workers wore tshirts saying i survived the iraca 
crush referring to the immigration reform and control act 
others caught naps in a small lounge filled with sleeping bags 
id say we are putting in 12 to 16hour days yolanda

countless mothers hoping to live comfortably 
in their old age surrounded by loving families subscribe to a 
bitter myth since many will face only poverty and isolation says 
a grim mothers day message to congress 
for those women growing old brings an economic nightmare as 
they face life without a spouse steady income or adequate health 
benefits according to the older womens league a group working 
for social reforms for women 
america must do more than take a onceayear look at 
motherhood lou glasse the leagues president said wednesday 
it is not enough to buy us off with cards and flowers she 
said these women deserve significant economic support from a 
society which they have supported all their lives 
the group which has 20000 members launched a campaign on 
capitol hill for pension reforms better health care for the 
elderly and increased job protection and benefits for mothers who 
work 
too many americans believe that older women enjoy a golden old 
age surrounded by loving and adoring children spouses and 
friends ms glasse said 
we do not deny that this is the reality for some she said 
but there is another america in which older women do not reap the 
benefits of a lifetime of hard work in which older women live in 
poverty and isolation 
the group released a report compiled from census and other 
data showing that 72 percent of the poor over age 65 are women and 
that a womans chances of being poor increase if she is black or 
hispanic divorced widowed or separated 
women constitute the majority of the elderly living alone but 
more than half have been alone for at least 10 years and a quarter 
have no surviving children to provide assistance if needed the 
report said 
the disparity between men and women in median income is greatest 
for midlife women aged 4554 the report said only four women in 
10 are currently vested in pension plans and job interruptions for 
having children or caring for a family member affect promotions 
salary and retirement benefits 
this is a conspiracy of circumstances that work throughout a 
womans life to consign her to poverty ms glasse said 
the group presented members of congress with mothers day cards 
outlining the report and the legislation they want to have enacted 
the group supports medicare coverage for longterm home care 
expanded coverage of adult day care catastrophic health care for 
the elderly an increase in the minimum wage employee benefits for 
parttime workers passage of the family and medical leave act and 
other health care measures 
norma downey mother of rep thomas downey a member of the 
house select committee on aging gave her son a mothers day card 
with instructions to take its message to the floor of congress 
on mothers day this sunday too many women will spend the day 
wondering how they will be able to pay their rent feed their 
children and maintain some semblance of the american dream she 
said

a jury wednesday recommended life in prison 
rather than the death penalty for a teenager convicted of 
bludgeoning a classmate to death with baseball bats and putting the 
body in a cistern 
ronald charles clements 17 of carl junction cried quietly as 
the recommendation was read jasper county circuit judge herbert 
casteel who is not bound by the recommendation set sentencing for 
june 14 
earlier wednesday the jury deliberated 2 hours before 
returning a firstdegree murder verdict against clements in the 
slaying dec 6 of stephen newberry 19 of carl junction a 
psychiatrist had called the slaying a satanic sacrifice 
firstdegree murder carries either the death penalty or life in 
prison without hope of parole 
another teenager pleaded guilty to murder in the slaying in 
exchange for a promise from prosecutors not to seek the death 
penalty a third teenager is awaiting trial 
newberry was struck at least 50 times with baseball bats 
authorities said his body was found a day later in a cistern in a 
wooded area near the kansas border 
clements had conceded taking part in the crime pleading 
innocent by reason of mental disease or defect in closing 
arguments attorneys clashed over his mental state 
under missouri law a person is absolved of responsibility in a 
crime if it can be shown that a mental disease or defect prevented 
him from knowing right from wrong or being able to conform his 
actions to the law 
defense attorney ross rhoades asked jurors to reflect on 
evidence of clementss chaotic family life including his parents 
turbulent marriage and his dependence on drugs dabbling in 
satanism and lifelong fascination with violence 
jasper county prosecutor david dally said in closing arguments 
that it was clear that clements acted deliberately 
you heard one of the psychiatrists offer a possible reason 
this young man had been getting his high off drugs for a number of 
years dally said he had been getting his high off music that 
i dont care for and im sure you dont 
he decided it was time for the ultimate thrill to see what 
it would be like to kill another human being the prosecutor 
said and ladies and gentlemen of the jury he has to be 
punished for it 
clements listened wednesday as his attorney played one of his 
cassette tapes in which the heavy metal rock group megadeth sings 
i hack up my victims like pieces of meat 
this boy did not have the capability of differentiating 
between fantasy and reality rhoades said in his closing 
argument in fact he escaped into fantasy from the reality he 
had endured for 16 17 years 
dr william logan director of the department of law and 
psychiatry at the menninger clinic in topeka kan said clements 
followed along when his friends suggested making the ultimate 
sacrifice to satan a human sacrifice 
logan said clements understood the killing was wrong but could 
not separate the act from fiction 
he almost expected the victim to be there the next day at 
school logan said

soviet and us veterans of the cold war are 
proposing that the united states and the soviet union stop 
intervening in the developing world as a step toward reducing their 
military competition 
the motto for the group might be no more afghanistans no more 
vietnams said arthur macy cox a former cia official who 
organized the effort with georgi arbatov head of moscows 
usacanada institute 
in a position paper issued today the soviets and americans call 
for the progressive demilitarization of ussoviet 
competition including sharp cuts in strategic nuclear and 
conventional arsenals elimination of chemical weapons and 
adherence to the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
all those areas are under negotiation between the superpowers 
the proposal breaks new ground by proposing a deal to end the 
cold war in the developing world saying we believe that 
military intervention by the superpowers in regional conflicts has 
reached a dangerous dead end and should be terminated by mutual 
agreements 
now is the right time for such a rapprochement far better than 
during detente said one american in the group townsend hoopes 
undersecretary of the air force under president lyndon johnson the 
americans were all members of the american committee on ussoviet 
relations and include former cia director william colby former 
undersecretary of state george ball and former sen john culver 
detente a period of thawing superpower relations under 
presidents nixon ford and carter produced a series of arms 
control agreements and increased trade between the superpowers but 
floundered amid us accusations that the soviets were continuing 
their military buildup and using force to install allied 
governments in the developing world 
we have a clear idea of why detente was ruined hoopes said 
in an interview the soviets understood detente to exclude behavior 
in the developing world the opposite of the us understanding 
this time says hoopes we are convinced of the sincerity on 
the russian side 
during detente the united states withdrew from vietnam 
at the same time the soviet union was supporting marxist 
insurgencies that took power in south vietnam laos cambodia 
angola nicaragua and ethiopia the soviet invasion of afghanistan 
in 1979 and the military crackdown in poland in 1981 nailed shut 
the coffin of detente in the view of many american analysts 
president reagan on taking office in 1981 sought to reverse 
soviet advances in the developing world by supporting insurgent 
movements a policy that probably contributed to the kremlin 
decision to withdraw troops from afghanistan but has been less 
successful elsewhere notably nicaragua 
the sovietamerican group is proposing an understanding under 
which the soviets pull out of afghanistan their cuban allies 
withdraw troops from ethiopia and angola and most soviet bloc 
military advisers in the developing world go home 
in return said cox the reagan doctrine must end and the 
united states would stop supporting anticommunist guerrilla 
movements in nicaragua angola and elsewhere 
additionally the two sides would agree to a list of weapons 
which they would not supply to developing nations 
the main points of the proposal reflect suggestions that have 
been made by kremlin leader mikhail s gorachev arbatov and other 
soviets in the bilateral group valentin falin fyodor burlatsky 
henry trofimenko vitaly zhurkin and andrei kortunov 
every one of these people is a spokesman for soviet policy 
most of them are influential said cox

a government report says the contaminated 
three mile island nuclear reactor can be safely mothballed but a 
citizens group fears that would effectively turn the site into a 
highlevel waste graveyard 
the nuclear regulatory commission staff approved a plan by the 
pennsylvania plants operator to place three mile island unit 2 in 
storage for some 20 years while radiation decays inside 
significantly the nrc staffs report which was released upon 
request wednesday said the plan was no better or worse than an 
alternative under which further cleanup work would be performed 
before the unit was mothballed 
that is the approach favored by three mile island alert a 
citizens group based near the plant in the middle of the 
susquehanna river near harrisburg 
eric epstein of tmia criticized the nrc on wednesday for being 
willing to accept a highlevel waste site on an island in the 
middle of a river indefinitely he said the plan enables gpu 
nuclear the plant operator to walk away from their commitment 
to completely decontaminate and decommission the plant 
the idea gpu said was to place the plant in safe stable and 
secure condition while radiation was allowed to decay naturally 
and new technologies were developed to permit easier access to the 
insides of reactor 
after studying the plan the nrc staff concluded it could be 
implemented without significant environmental harm and that 
no alternative was found to be clearly preferable from an 
environmental impact perspective 
the nrc staff is soliciting comments from the public before 
making its conclusions final 
unit 2 was disabled in the nations worst commercial nuclear 
accident on march 31 1979 the reactor was allowed to lose vital 
cooling water that normally covers it uncovered material in the 
radioactive core melted partially 
the subsequent 1 billion cleanup expected to completed in 
mid1989 has focused on water decontamination waste shipment and 
removal of fuel from the damaged core

president reagan is softening his sharply 
antisoviet rhetoric as the moscow summit nears a meeting he 
contends shouldnt have a winner or a loser 
reagan in a speech wednesday in chicago offered a startling 
amount of praise for soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the human 
rights reforms hes begun 
the presidents remarks came in sharp contrast to a speech he 
gave april 21 in which he lambasted the soviet role in afghanistan 
and suggested they wouldnt keep their pledge to withdraw from 
their neighboring country 
in his address to the national strategy forum a group concerned 
with foreign policy and national strategy issues reagan lauded 
gorbachev for loosening restrictions on religion freedom of 
speech press and emigration 
we applaud the changes that have taken place and encourage the 
soviets to go farther reagan said we recognize that changes 
occur slowly but that is better than no change at all 
reagans speech was the nexttolast in a series of addresses 
designed to highlight the issues he intends to raise at the summit 
in moscow with gorbachev set for may 29june 2 
in recent months the soviet union has shown a willingness to 
respect at least some human rights it is my belief that there is 
hope for further change hope that in the days ahead the soviets 
will grant further recognition to the fundamental civil and 
political rights of all reagan said 
he took note of a development he termed of tremendous 
significance in recent months that the soviets themselves are 
beginning to talk and print stories about economic shortages in 
their country 
the president also said some 300 political and religious 
prisoners had been released from labor camps over the last three 
years and that the incarceration of dissidents in mental hospitals 
and prisons has slowed and in some cases stopped 
while reagan said much religious activity remains repressed in 
the soviet union but controls have been relaxed 
he added that he is heartened by the progress made in the 
increased numbers allowed to emigrate as well as the loosening of 
controls on family visits 
the president acknowledged that the united states has its own 
problems with homelessness racial discrimination and unemployment 
moscow has used the problems in an attempt to counter us 
criticisms of soviet human rights policies in a bow to soviet 
concerns reagan said their critique deserves a full response 
in a brief question and answer session with the audience reagan 
said he was willing to give gorbachev the benefit of the doubt 
up to a point that the soviet leader sincerely wants to achieve 
the program of economic and social reforms known as glasnost 
the president said he believes gorbachev is pursuing the reforms 
because of economic problems in the soviet union 
reagan said he hoped he could offer gorbachev some suggestions 
at the summit on how he could move ahead with glasnost 
that i think is preferable to staging a kind of contest with 
him so that someone looks like a winner or loser reagan said 
white house communications director tom griscom denied reagans 
remarks were designed to mollify gorbachev who took issue with 
reagans antisoviet attacks during a recent meeting with secretary 
of state george shultz 
griscom argued that reagans approach to the soviets was 
consistent but that his speeches varied because he addressed 
different topics 
the president also played down expectations for the moscow 
meeting saying he didnt expect to sign a new treaty on longrange 
strategic missiles he added that both he and gorbachev were 
hopeful their pact banning mediumrange weapons could be ready 
for signing but noted the us senate hasnt moved rapidly to 
approve the pact 
reagan said he continued to look for additional changes in the 
soviet union but was realistic given soviet history 
he said the west has observed progress before only to see it 
wither away 
that reagan said was the reason us dealings with the soviets 
must be based on candor and realism 
just as previous hopeful moments in soviet history ended all 
too soon so too glasnost todays new candor will succeed if 
the soviets take steps to make it permanent to institutionalize 
it reagan said

a house chairman says will move swiftly to 
fashion a plan to stop former members of congress and top executive 
branch officials from becoming instant lobbyists right after they 
leave government 
rep barney frank dmass says he plans follow the senates 
footsteps and begin moving revolving door legislation in a 
very short time in his judiciary government relations 
subcommittee 
there is broad agreement in the congress that we should be 
moving on this frank said wednesday at a subcommittee hearing 
prompted by senate passage last month of an ethics bill to put 
congress for the first time under postemployment lobbying 
restrictions 
during senate debate supporters referred to the cases of lyn 
nofziger and michael deaver who ran into legal problems in 
connection with highpriced lobbying after they left top white 
house posts 
witnesses gave franks subcommittee mixed reviews about the 
senate bill with john keeney acting head of the justice 
departments criminal division saying the reagan administration 
favored some parts of it and opposed others 
keeney said the senate plan is too broad because it would simply 
ban much forpay lobbying by former lawmakers and senior political 
appointees for a year after they leave their jobs 
instead keeney said prohibitions against cashing in on inside 
knowledge and connections should have a nexus between the 
lobbying and the officials former position or responsibilities 
a muchcriticized 10yearold ethics law does not cover congress 
which keeney says the administration feels should be covered 
and puts a years ban on topdrawer executive branch officials 
lobbying their former agencies 
critics say the law has been eroded by office of government 
ethics rulings that compartmentalize agencies banning a former 
officials contacts with his or her previous section but leaving 
them free to lobby elsewhere in the agency 
the senate bill would prohibit former high officials from 
lobbying anywhere in the executive branch and trying to influence 
members of congress for a year former lawmakers could not lobby 
congress or top white house aides and cabinet secretaries for a 
year 
if there ever was a bill whose time has come this is it 
said rep e clay shaw jr of florida the subcommittees ranking 
republican he said congress has been extremely hypocritical to 
exempt itself from the ethics law 
we have a real problem said rep howard wolpe dmich 
when richard nixon can go on meet the press and with a straight 
face comment on the washington sleaze factor then we have a 
problem 
rep marcy kaptur dohio said that while the deaver and 
nofziger cases have captured public attention problems exist 
elsewhere such as the office of us trade representative where 
15 officials departed in 1986 to become lobbyists or foreign agents 
their institutional memory and knowledge of us negotiating 
strategies gives foreign interests a clear bargaining advantage 
kaptur testified 
ann mcbride senior vice president of common cause the 
selfdescribed citizens lobby urged approval of a strong 
revolving door bill but morton halperin of the american civil 
liberties union said there is no proven need to include former 
members of congress and that doing so would be bad policy and 
possibly unconstitutional

an 8yearold boy who survived being submerged 
20 minutes in a pond in february is hoping to root for the 
cincinnati reds this summer 
james r reilly has been at childrens hospital medical center 
here since feb 16 when he fell through the ice while playing at 
an industrial park near his cincinnatiarea home in northern 
kentuckys boone county 
these days jr as he is known to family and friends spends 
his time writing talking with nurses and doctors and playing with 
a big brown teddy bear near his bed doctors arent saying when he 
can go home 
he keeps track of the reds his favorite baseball team eric 
davis and pete rose are my favorites he said 
his youth and vigor are advantages in recovery and he seems 
more alert his mother said he is active in his hospital ward and 
he knows the nurses and doctors names 
a physical therapist works on strengthening his legs and 
improving handeye coordination 
the youngster was rescued by his 14yearold brother michael 
i was scared and cold at first michael recalled but when i 
thought about jr i didnt feel cold at all 
after 2025 minutes michael pulled his brother to shore once 
james was out of the water charles deaton 17 of newport ky 
who was nearby performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
he remained in a coma for about a week but regained 
consciousness we didnt leave the hospital for two weeks said 
his father jim 
since then jr has made steady progress the accident 
decreased his lung capacity and he must work to regain his 
strength and coordination but there has been no sign of brain 
damage doctors say 
doctors have told the parents there will be some permanent lung 
damage though it will be some time before its extent will be 
known the boy still has a tube in his chest that he has to cover 
in order to speak 
his recovery is credited primarily to a body function called the 
mammalian diving reflex when the human body is submerged in cold 
water for an extended time the heartbeat slows and oxygenrich 
blood is sent from the arms and legs to the heart and brain the 
reflex is more active in children

perch he is like a captain confidently scanning the horizons of 
his world secure in the knowledge that his ship will carry him 
safely through any threatening seas children vulnerable and 
dependent desperately need such security and it has ever been a 
duty and a joy of fatherhood to offer it 
being a father requires strength in many ways above all it 
requires character raising a family is no easy task of course 
but one of trial frustration and disappointment great strength 
and more than a little courage are needed to persevere to fight 
discouragement and to keep working for the family in that 
strength and with gods grace fathers find the patience to teach 
the fortitude to provide the compassion to comfort and the mercy 
to forgive all of this is to say that they find the strength to 
love their wives and children selflessly and it is above all for 
this wondrous mysterious love that fathers shower upon their 
families and that allows them to ceaselessly put their families 
needs first that we honor fathers with their own special day 
our gratitude is not limited to fathers day but remains 
constant indeed there are not enough days in the year to express 
it properly still it is fitting that on such a day the american 
people pause to celebrate all fathers for their loving care for 
their youngsters our nation can only continue to prosper if our 
families prosper nothing can replace the familys role as prime 
nurturer and educator of children and nowhere are our countrys 
shared values more effectively transmitted to future generations 
so let us thank all fathers on this day but above all let us 
each take this occasion to express our thanks and our affection to 
our own fathers whether we can do so in person or in prayer we 
are perhaps no longer little children riding on our fathers 
shoulders yet we will forever feel their firm and loving guidance 
through lifes challenges 
now therefore i ronald reagan president of the united states 
of america in according with a joint resolution of the congress 
approved april 24 1972 36 usc 142a do hereby proclaim 
sunday june 19 1988 as fathers day i invite the states and 
communities and people of the united states to observe that day 
with appropriate ceremonies as a mark of appreciation and abiding 
affection for their fathers i direct government officials to 
display the flag of the united states on all federal government 
buildings and i urge all americans to display the flag at their 
homes and other suitable places on that day 
in witness thereof i have here unto set my hand this third day 
of may in the year of our lord nineteen hundred and eightyeight

the united states has taken its complaint 
about japans beef and citrus import restrictions to gatt where 
the reagan administrations chief trade negotiator says the dispute 
may be settled by the end of this year 
moreover us trade representative clayton yeutter says zenchu 
japans central union of agricultural cooperatives had better 
rethink a threat made to boycott imports of american feed grains or 
suffer the consequences 
yeutter predicted wednesday at a news conference that the 
japanese restrictions on beef and citrus imports will be declared 
illegal by gatt the general agreement on tariffs and trade such a 
finding would open the way to compensation or possible us trade 
reprisals or a combination of both he said 
japan accepted the process at a gatt meeting in geneva hours 
after breakdown of talks in washington on tuesday night a panel to 
consider the issue is expected to be convened soon 
however yeutter said overall trade relations between the two 
countries are still very good and the united states would be 
happy at any time to listen to new japanese proposals provided 
they reflect a whole lot more market liberalization than surfaced 
in the last few days 
the commerce department has estimated that annual us beef 
exports to japan of about 550 million could grow to about 1 
billion under free trade and exports of oranges and orange juice 
now less than 100 million a year could top 150 million 
we will not permit this case to spill into the next 
administration he said were going to resolve this dispute 
one way or another during this administration 
disclosing new details of his negotiations with japanese 
agriculture minister takashi sato however yeutter said the united 
states would have accepted a proposal for a threeyear phase out of 
the beef quota if japan had not sought to raise new barriers 
he also said a twoyear phase out of orange and orange juice 
import quotas could have been accepted but japan insisted on five 
years and offered only a 10 percent annual tonnage increase 
yeutter was asked about a threat by zenchu to boycott us feed 
grains because of the american request for gatt action on japans 
import restrictions 
i would certainly hope it doesnt happen because that would 
be met with a harsh reaction by everyone here in the united 
states including the agriculture department the office of the 
us trade representative the reagan administration as a whole 
and congress he said japan as a nation would pay a very high 
price for that kind of vindictive action 
at a later telephone hookup with farm broadcasters yeutter 
reiterated his view that a gatt decision on the us complaint 
would come relatively soon and said he made that clear to the 
japanese agriculture minister 
i told him that in no way would we permit this issue to spill 
over into the next administration which is obviously what the 
japanese would prefer yeutter said so theyre going to have 
to face it at the very latest toward the end of this year 
yeutter added were rather confident of winning the gatt 
dispute on both beef and citrus and were confident that the panel 
can come down with a recommendation and a decision in a relatively 
short period of time 
the national cattlemens association supported the move to put 
the issue in gatt because japans position left no choice to do 
otherwise said association president dale humphrey 
we cannot accept a proposal that would leave japans beef 
market essentially closed to producers he said japan has a 
responsibility as a major trading partner to open its market this 
is an opportunity for japan to demonstrate that willingness and 
settle the beef trade dispute once and for all 
john datt of the american farm bureau federation expressed 
disappointment that japan has again refused to eliminate clearly 
illegal import restrictions 
datt said japans offer to phase out its import quota system in 
favor of new permanent import levies would be just replacing one 
protectionist program with a worse one for a countrys thats a 
major player in world trade japan is refusing to act like one

an experimental drug that erodes a pigs 
natural defense against pigging out may be the key to producing 
leaner pork a us department of agriculture scientist says 
ordinarily pigs know when they are full and dont really pig 
out said jerome c pekas an animal physiologist at the us 
meat animal research center in clay center 
pigs aversion to stuffing their snouts is due to a naturally 
produced hormone that tells them when to lay off the feed he said 
wednesday in a telephone interview from las vegas nev where he 
was attending the 72nd annual meeting of the federation of american 
societies for experimental biology 
an initial study found pigs ate more but put on leaner tissue 
when injected with a compound that immunizes them against the 
hormone cholecystokinin or cck 
the pigs thought they were hungry so they ate more pekas 
said 
a pigs immune system treats the compound a harmless decoy 
as a foreign invader by developing antibodies to it he said 
pekas conducted the study in nebraska with animal physiologists 
bruce d schanbacher and william e trout pekas said he has 
researched appetite regulation and feeding of swine since 1981 the 
latest study began in the fall of 1986 
this is pretty brandspanking new stuff we are talking about 
here this is the first public disclosure pekas said 
the 12 leaner pigs in the test group consumed an average of 225 
pounds more feed and gained 11 pounds more during the 82day 
treatment period compared to the 12 control pigs he said 
the scientists injected the pigs first at 11 weeks and later 
gave three booster shots but pekas believes only one booster may 
eventually be used 
pigs that got the special injection continue to use feed 
efficiently digest extra feed and go to the feed trough more often 
than pigs in the control group he said 
pekas said researchers were somewhat surprised and dont really 
understand why the meat on pigs receiving the compound was leaner 
he added that more research was needed to determine if the drug was 
the cause 
i was impressed myself that the meat grows leaner id be 
almost inclined to say that was unexpected i would have been 
content to have observed that the animals were eating more feed and 
gaining more weight he said 
physiologists first recognized cck as a hormone that causes the 
gall bladder in humans and animals to contract pekas said its 
possible effect on appetite regulation became known within the last 
10 years he said technology for using the new compound could be 
available within a year but the usda would have to clear its use 
pekas said he envisions the hormone being further studied in 
human medicine to treat problems caused by low appetite such as 
anorexia nervosa or insatiable appetite such as obesity 
charles harness a spokesman for the national pork producers 
council based in des moines iowa said he was not familiar with 
the study but confirmed much research is being conducted to produce 
leaner products 
mike sondag executive vice president of the illinois pork 
producers association also said he was aware of efforts to make 
pork leaner but was not familiar with the latest study 
several years ago that was our campaign theme america youre 
leaning on pork sondag said 
you look at todays hog versus the one back in the 1950s or 
1960s and there is a tremendous difference in the composition and 
actual appearance of the pigs there is significantly less fat than 
there used to be we say pork is 50 percent leaner than it was 25 
years ago

requests he said he was mad as hell about it

businessman said harris a 1984 north carolina coordinator for 
the jackson campaign i would take my sister to court if she 
owed me money

times to pay me i have a beef with his staff not jesse 
harris said he was asked by jackson associates to make the loan 
to the concerned citizens humanitarian fund inc based in 
savannah ga records in georgia show the fund was incorporated on 
jan 3 1984 the day goodman was released 
jackson told the the associated press in a recent interview that 
his campaign attorney edward coaxum created a special 
humanitarian fund in 1984 to pay for the candidates two foreign 
trips to latin america during the campaign 
little is known about the humanitarian fund incorporated as a 
nonprofit organization the fund has never filed an annual report 
listing its officers or any details about how much money it has 
raised and spent said carolyn harris of the georgia secretary of 
states office 
harris said he was asked to lend the money to the fund by 
benjamin polote who owns a construction company in savannah and 
helped raise money for jacksons 1984 campaign 
the chicago tribune reported tuesday that bank records show the 
humanitarian funds account paid out 17876 of harris 25000 
loan to a travel agency that handled the syrian trip but that it 
was not clear what happened to the rest of the money 
i gave them a deadline to pay me back said harris but 
refused to say if the deadline had passed they are going to pay 
me i demand payment

glasnost is giving americans a rare glimpse at 
russian and soviet art ranging from religious icons to the 
avantgarde of the early 20th century and works of official 
contemporaries 
the corcoran gallery today opens a show of three contemporary 
soviet artists the national museum of american history next friday 
starts an exhibit of russian religious icons and in july the 
hirshhorn museum is showing 90 important but seldom seen canvases 
by russian avantgarde painters 
its kind of the glasnost of the day around here said 
sidney lawrence spokesman the hirshhorn gallery site of the most 
important of the three shows 
the exhibit is the first to come out of the soviet union made 
up exclusively of paintings from this period that will show in the 
west hirshhorn director james t demetrion said in statement 
many of the paintings by such greats as marc chagall vasily 
kandinsky and kasimir malevich were locked away for decades in the 
basements of leningrad and moscow museums while soviet authorities 
enforced the official style known as socialist realism 
for many americans this may the first and only glimpse of 
paintings that art historians describe as among the most important 
in the early 20th century 
malevich is particularly crucial because he is credited with 
painting the first abstract canvases in 191011 according to art 
historians 
the hirshhorn exhibit runs from july 12 to september 25 
the show at the corcoran marks another first part of a 
pioneering official exchange that sent canvases by the wyeth family 
to the soviet union 
in return the soviets sent works by boris ugarov tair salakhov 
and dmitri bisti three official artists whose work illustrates 
movement away from the sometimes stifling motifs of socialist 
realism such as tractors and smiling peasants and workers 
the work of ugarov a native of leningrad and winner of the 
state prize of the ussr in 1985 is reminiscent of such french 
postimpressionsts as degas and cezanne 
salakhov born in azerbaijan has traveled abroad and his 
canvases include such familiar images as the empire state building 
in new york 
bisti another state prize winner is a book illustrator who 
appears to draw more heavily on purely russian themes 
distancing himself from the abstract work that will be featured 
at the hirshhorn bisti told a news conference wednesday that 
realism is the russian tradition other styles are a departure 
from the mainstream 
of the three washington exhibits that at the american history 
museum has the most traditional russian art 50 metallic icons from 
the 17th to the late 19th century 
the overall collection of 350 icons was sold to the smithsonian 
in 1892 by george kunz a tiffany amp co buyer who picked them up in 
the russian city of nizhninovgorod now known as gorky 
although sizable collections of wooden icons exist in the west 
and soviet union the smithsonian trove of metallic icons is 
believed to be the largest of its kind in the west and possibly 
the most thoroughly studied in the world said curator richard 
ahlorn 
specialists began to restore and study the collection in the 
early 1980s and conceived the idea of holding an exhibition to 
coincide with the 1000year anniversary of christianity in russia 
which is being held in the soviet union this june 
the icons made of a copper alloy where used in churches in 
homes and were carried by members of the russian orthodox faith 
from about the 9th century when greek orthodox missionaries 
introduced christianity into russia said ahlorn

marianas chain in the western pacific officials said 
no injuries or damage were immediately reported 
the quake occurred at 147 pm hst wednesday 747 pm edt 
about 300 miles northeast of guam and measured 53 on the richter

the government says more than half the 7 
million undergraduates who enrolled in college fulltime last year 
received financial aid compared with less than a quarter of the 
42 million parttime students 
for the 58 percent of the fulltime students receiving financial 
aid the support from all sources the federal government states 
and the college itself averaged 3813 according to a survey 
released wednesday by the department of educations center for 
statistics 
for the rest the financial aid was 2199 on average 
overall 46 percent of the 112 million undergraduates received 
some type of aid with 35 percent getting federal help 
while 24 percent of the parttimers got help from some source 
less than 1 in 7 got any help from washington 
the cost of attending college including tuition room board 
books and other expenses averaged 6000 in the fall of 1986 for 
the students they were surveyed last spring about how they were 
paying for college and what it cost 
the center said 77 percent of all the students attended public 
colleges 18 percent private colleges and 5 percent proprietary or 
forprofit trade schools 
the trade school students were far more likely to draw financial 
aid 
the socalled national postsecondary student aid survey found 
that 84 percent of those enrolled in proprietary schools received 
aid and 81 percent of those got federal help nearly 35000 
students were questioned 
that compared with 65 percent of private college students who 
were getting help including 48 percent who got aid from 
washington and 38 percent of all public college students 29 
percent of whom got federal aid 
the college board has reported previously that 205 billion in 
aid was available in 198687 about 60 percent was in the form of 
federal pell grants outright gifts based on need and guaranteed 
student loans 
the college board released a separate survey wednesday that 
showed parttime enrollments grew up 73 percent while 
fulltime enrollments shrank by 24 percent between 1980 and 1986 
in another report the american association of university 
professors said the average full professor now earns 47400 after 
a 49 percent raise for 198788 the average salary across all 
faculty ranks was 37000 
the governments student aid survey found nearly 56 percent of 
black and 41 percent of hispanic undergraduates got federal help 
compared with 35 percent of all undergraduates 
some 94 percent of those receiving aid in proprietary schools 
22 percent in public institutions and 12 percent in private 
colleges never completed high school or obtained an equivalency 
degree 
under current law dropouts can get federal aid for college if 
the institution judges they have the ability to benefit from 
the training the reagan administration plans to ask congress this 
week to change the law and deny aid to those without diplomas 
chester finn jr the education departments assistant secretary 
for educational research and improvement said only 20 percent of 
undergraduates live on campus in dorms while 50 percent live 
offcampus and 30 percent reside with their parents 
finn said that belies the image of the typical college student 
if you want to figure out peoples costs and resources dont 
start by thinking of a dormdweller going to school fulltime with 
a check from his father to pay these costs finn said 
those living in dorms reported total expenses that averaged 
8187 for those living offcampus the figure was 5042 and for 
those living at home with their parents just 3970 
but the people who conducted the survey said the students living 
at home underestimated just how much their food and housing 
actually cost their family

a white house deputy wrote a note in 1982 to 
his boss edwin meese iii that your personal goahead to me led 
to a 32 million nobid federal contract going to wedtech corp a 
congressional report says 
wednesdays bipartisan report by the senate subcommittee on 
oversight of government management concludes that meese and the 
former deputy james jenkins violated white house ethics rules on 
government contracts resulting in improper favoritism to 
wedtech meese was counselor to the president at the time 
the subcommittees conclusion disputed by meeses lawyers is 
the latest in a series of disclosures and allegations that have 
harmed meeses tenure as attorney general 
meanwhile justice department aides to meese were busily 
answering questions about a new controversy surrounding the 
attorney general his letter soliciting 30000 lawyers and 
businessmen to accompany him to a conference in japan 
assistant attorney general charles j cooper head of the 
departments office of legal counsel concluded the meese trip and 
solicitation meet applicable legal and ethical standards said 
department spokesman terry eastland 
the matter is under investigation by the office of government 
ethics which polices a presidential order forbidding officials 
from conflicts of interest or actions that have the appearance of 
conflict or favoritism 
meeses letter was sent april 26 by the trip sponsors on the 
attorney generals stationery with the justice department seal 
when meese and other justice officials approved his letter they 
were unaware that the nonprofit sponsor people to people 
international of kansas city was working with its profitmaking 
arm to recruit participants in the trip and a private conference in 
japan on international legal and economic issues said eastland 
meese and jenkins got involved with wedtech despite at least 
three warnings at various times by two white house officials not to 
do so the senate subcommittee report found 
thencabinet secretary craig fuller told jenkins not to get 
involved but jenkins went ahead anyway because fuller wasnt my 
boss so he couldnt tell me not to jenkins told the senate 
subcommittee staff 
in addition the report said a note to jenkins initialed by 
fuller stated strongly recommend no white house action be 
taken 
finally former white house counsel fred fielding told the 
senate subcommittee staff that he had advised jenkins either 
directly or through fuller not to intervene on behalf of wedtech 
jenkins efforts culminated with the award of the engine 
contract to the south bronx ny defense contractor which had 
long been at odds with army officials who thought wedtechs price 
for building small engines was too high jenkins note to meese in 
the fall of 1982 said your personal goahead to me saved this 
project according to the senate report 
the bipartisan report said e robert wallach sent meese 16 memos 
in 1981 and 1982 detailing wedtechs efforts to get the contract 
wallach under indictment in the wedtech scandal was paid 13 
million by the company 
former counselor to the president edwin meese iii and former 
deputy counselor jim jenkins failed to observe the white house 
policy on contacts with procurement officials which failure 
resulted in improper favoritism toward a specific contractor the 
report said 
the white house procurement policy in effect since october 1981 
says obviously no member of the white house staff should 
contact any procurement officer about a contract in which he has a 
personal financial interest or in which a relative friend or 
business associate has a financial interest 
in looking under the wedtech rock the subcommittee has 
uncovered a picture of greed influencepeddling and corruption 
said the panels chairman sen carl levin dmich we have found 
improper and biased decisionmaking by top agency officials who 
were influenced by wellpaid wedtech consultants 
meeses lawyer nathan lewin said meeses actions didnt give 
the appearance of impropriety and did not fall within the scope of 
the white house regulation 
lewin said the white house policy was designed to prohibit a 
white house official from intervening at the request of a friend 
who was asking that a certain company be awarded a contract 
lewin said that in this instance meese was simply trying to 
ensure that wedtech was treated fairly when it was considered for 
the contract

republicans are grumbling that a quick rewrite 
by house democrats of the omnibus trade bill aims at winning enough 
senate votes to override a veto while retaining a plantclosing 
provision opposed by president reagan 
the house voted 253159 wednesday to remove curbs on exports of 
alaskan oil from the 1000page bill which won final passage last 
week the move was contained in a resolution authorizing technical 
changes in the bill 
the resolution would simply authorize an official known as the 
enrolling clerk to erase the oil provisions while he is dotting the 
is and crossing the ts in the mammoth piece of legislation 
republicans complained that deleting curbs on alaska oil exports 
after the bill was passed violated house rules and was designed to 
gain the votes of alaskas two senators democratic leaders 
however said their plan was fashioned as a compromise gesture to 
reagan 
what we need here is a good oldfashioned compromise rep 
david bonior dmich said wednesday 
but house republicans were scornful 
youve come the wrong half and youve done it the wrong way 
rep william frenzel rminn said when its over its over 
we have here a technical procedure said minority leader 
robert h michel rill with which the majority will attempt to 
surgically extract something from a piece of legislation that has 
been officially formally and finally adopted by both houses of the 
congress and should now by all rights be on the presidents desk 
for signature 
reagan has been expressing concern for weeks over a provision of 
the trade bill that would require companies with more than 100 
employees to provide 60day notice of plant closings and 
largescale layoffs 
house democrats citing the hardship of surprise plant closings 
on employees and their families said they will not drop that 
provision 
maybe they should consult their astrologer to find out when 
they are going to be out of work rep barney frank dmass 
told the house 
more recently reagan also has criticized the alaska oil 
provisions 
one of those provisions would limit exports of petroleum 
products from new refineries in alaska to 70000 barrels a day and 
50 percent of output the other would clear the way for sending 
50000 barrels of crude a day to canada but first the oil would 
have to be transported in a us vessel to a port in the lower 48 
states before turning around and going north of the border 
both provisions are favorites of politically influential 
maritime unions 
democratic leaders had been hoping to persuade alaskas 
republican senators ted stevens and frank murkowski to vote in 
favor of the trade bill when the leaders were unable to strip out 
the oil export curbs the two alaskans opposed the measure when the 
senate passed it 6336 last week 
stevens later said he could not guarantee that he would support 
the trade bill even if the alaska provision had been dropped

more than 200 older boeing 737s belonging to 
us airlines are under special scrutiny for possible cracking and 
corrosion as a result of last weeks terror aboard an aloha 
airlines jet in which the cabin tore open during flight 
the federal aviation administration announced wednesday that all 
boeing 737s with more than 30000 landings are to be visually 
inspected for cracks and corrosion in the upper part of the 
fuselage those with at least 50000 landings must undergo special 
tests with highfrequency electronic equipment the agency said 
the wider inspection was ordered in part because several 
additional reports of corrosion delamination and cracks were 
discovered in a number of aircraft since the aloha accident a week 
ago the faa said 
the agency did not say what airlines were involved in the 
discovery of additional cracks and corrosion the inspections apply 
to the top section of the plane from just behind the cockpit to the 
tail section 
the faa reiterated a warning issued in a directive last november 
that such cracks if close together and allowed to corrode could 
result in a structural failure of the fuselage if not corrected 
investigators believe such a sequence of events likely occurred 
aboard the aloha jet last thursday when a 20foot secton of the 
cabin wall and ceiling ripped away 24000 feet a flight attendant 
was swept to her death and 61 people were injured before the plane 
landed in hawaii 
the 19yearold plane was one of the oldest and most heavily 
used boeing 737s manufactured with a history of nearly 89000 
landings 
faa administrator allan mcartor nevertheless said the older 
boeing 737s subject to the increased inspections are just as safe 
as newer models he said the aircraft warranted closer scrutiny 
because in light of the aloha accident it is time for an 
abundance of caution 
david jimenez a spokesman for the boeing co said in seattle 
that there are 212 boeing 737s operated by 19 us airlines in 
domestic service that would be subject to the faa inspections 
announced wednesday 
another 161 boeing 737s with more than 30000 landings are owned 
by foreign airlines and fly outside the united states he said 
while these planes may be inspected they are not directly subject 
to the faa order 
the faa is concerned about the aircraft because the boeing 737 
is a shorthaul plane that normally accumulates a high number of 
takeoffs cabin pressurizations depressurizations and landings 
this cycle puts stress on the planes fuselage and can after time 
cause an increased number of cracks in the outer metal skin 
in addition the older boeing 737s also used a socalled cold 
bonding process to hold sections of the metal skin in place 
the faa has reason to believe that possible delamination of the 
bond requires mandatory inspections said mcartor 
according to jimenez all of the boeing 737s on which the cold 
bonding process was used the first 291 planes built have more 
than 30000 landings and are already subject to the faas broader 
inspection order 
last week the faa ordered many of the older boeing 737s to fly 
no higher than 23000 feet until they are inspected but that 
directive applied to only 66 planes that had 55000 or more 
landings the altitude restrictions remain in effect for the planes 
covered by the new requirements officials said 
the new order expands the visual inspections and requires those 
with 50000 landings to automatically undergo socalled eddy 
current inspections using highfrequency electronic devices 
mcartor said he does not think the inspection requirements will 
disrupt air travel because airlines will have between 250 and 500 
landings depending on type of inspection to comply the airlines 
must report to the faa within 48 hours on the results of any 
inspections 
the boeing 737 is widely used for shorthaul flights with more 
than 1500 of them in service around the world the older 737100 
and 200 series aircraft on which the concern about cracking and 
corrosion has centered total 1139 worldwide although many of 
them have had fewer than 30000 landings

cars were sent careening off highways 
windows shattered and a jetliner was jolted in the air by the chain 
of atomic bomblike blasts that tore through a rocket fuel plant 
here 
i was sitting in a booth eating pizza and the windows blew 
out officer michael peterson of the nevada highway patrol said 
wednesday after the explosions erupted from the industrial park 10 
miles from las vegas 
we thought the whole building was going down he said 
everybody took off right away 
cars traveling on highway 148 were knocked off the road by the 
concussion and motorists were injured said capt terry edwards of 
the clark county fire department 
people in their vehicles on this road were injured and their 
cars were damaged he said they just went off the road and 
wrecked 
authorities said more than 250 people were injured and one 
person was killed by the explosions which struck just before noon 
wednesday at the plant that manufactures ingredients for space 
shuttle rocket fuel 
the blasts which made gamblers briefly flee at least one 
casino were recorded by seismographs at california institute of 
technology in pasadena 200 miles away 
it flipped cars over knocked pedestrians to the ground and 
windows in the whole town shattered said susan russo 37 a 
henderson resident who was in her pickup truck at the time of the 
blasts 
gaming tables were briefly abandoned at sams town on boulder 
highway but 15 minutes later it appeared there was no danger and 
hundreds of gamblers went back inside said resort spokeswoman 
shelley roberts 
a las vegasbound america west jetliner approaching mccarran 
international airport was rocked by the blasts said passenger john 
conrad 62 of westlake village calif

miniatomic bomb he said there was a tall column of smoke 
going up 20000 feet 
there were no injuries aboard flight 46 which originated in 
burbank calif 
first we saw these very intense hot flames it didnt mean 
much to us at first we thought they were burning tires or 
something then there was another slight jolt he said 
several large windows and sliding glass doors at the airport 
less than 10 miles from the blast site were shattered by the 
explosion and some ceiling tiles were knocked loose said airport 
spokesman roy clawson 
pacific worker joe hedrick 30 said he heard a series of four 
explosions over several minutes with the fourth blast sounding the 
most powerful 
hendrick tearful and distraught with cuts on his arms said he 
an two coworkers were assembling a pollution control device when 
they heard a pop and the room filled with smoke 
the smoke was so thick it could choke you it smelled like 
plastic hedrick said the pop was followed by a blast that blew 
metal and fiberglass wall panels off the building 
hedrick said he fled in his truck and was about 2 miles from the 
plant when another explosion shattered the windshield 
youve seen pictures of a nuclear detonation with a cloud that 
runs across the ground it looked like that hedrick said of the 
final blast the further we drove it seemed the blasts kept 
coming 
the plant is in an isolated desert area on the western fringes 
of henderson southeast of las vegas the industrial complex dates

a house subcommittee has approved 100 million 
for the 44 billion super conducting supercollider physics project 
but barred use of the money for construction and equipment 
we feel like the 100 million is adequate to hold the team 
together the scientists and also to go ahead with the necessary 
research and all the preliminaries getting ready for 
construction said tom bevill dala and chairman of the house 
appropriations subcommittee on energy but we do not intend to 
start construction on that and put this project on the credit 
card 
the subcommittees decision on wednesday raised the proposed 
spending from the 60 million it had initially approved for fiscal 
1989 which begins oct 1 the higher appropriations level had the 
backing of democratic and republican leaders in the house bevill 
said 
president reagan had asked congress to approve 363 million for 
the project which would use a 53mileround particle accelerator 
to smash subatomic particles into each other physicists hope the 
research will give insight into the basic structure of matter but 
also say the project will have practical spinoffs as well 
supporters argue the super collider is needed to keep the united 
states competitive in the next century opponents say the project 
would siphon much needed money from other scientific research 
seven states have been selected as potential sites for the 
project arizona colorado illinois michigan north carolina 
tennessee and texas 
once were down to a single site it is going to be even 
harder to find support for the funding said rep carl pursell 
rmich and the only subcommittee member from a super collider 
state 
bevill said this money is not to be used for purchasing 
equipment or starting construction 
but pursell disputed bevills contention saying the use of the 
money will depend on the legal language adopted by the full 
appropriations committee 
i have maintained anything over 80 million involves 
construction pursell said

a congressional report says the united states 
never lodged an official protest with south korea over evidence 
that americandesigned rifles built in korea have been sold to 
foreign countries in violation of a uskorean agreement 
the general accounting office found there was little oversight 
of the program and confusion over which government agency should be 
in charge of the 1971 pact which banned sales of the m16 rifles 
to foreign nations without us permission and placed a cap on the 
number south korea could produce 
defense and state department officials in various agencies and 
locations told us that they were not responsible for managing the 
program said the report which was obtained wednesday by the 
associated press 
when presented with evidence of illegal foreign sales the state 
department usually instructed embassy officials to remind korea of 
the seriousness of such sales a strong official government 
protest was never lodged gao said 
the agreement included colt industries firearms division of 
hartford conn which set up the korean rifle plant in exchange

purchase from a developer a 600acre plot of land adjacent to the 
manassas national battlefield park where two important civil war 
battles were fought 
the congressmen say plans for a 12 million squarefoot shopping 
center would violate the battlefield site 
weve come to this conclusion because both of us feel theres 
no other choice said andrews both of us are convinced that 
the local developers and politicians intend to build the shopping 
mall

a fierce challenge by rep hal daub has 
sen david karnes fighting for survival in next weeks republican 
primary and the victor has to face a popular democratic 
exgovernor in the main event 
democratic state chairman tom monaghan says he hopes the gop 
rivals wake up after the voting bloodied and broke 
whoever wins tuesdays gop showdown will have to face former 
gov bob kerrey 44 whos expected to easily beat his democratic 
primary opponent ken michaelis a 45yearold disbarred lawyer 
from west point neb 
the gop race is a dead heat according to an omaha worldherald 
poll taken last week karnes was backed by 41 percent daub by 40 
percent and 19 percent said they were undecided the margin of 
error was 4 percentage points 
the same poll found kerrey leading either daub or karnes by more 
than 20 percentage points 
karnes 39 is in the unusual position of being an incumbent 
facing a tough bid for nomination he was appointed by republican 
gov kay orr in march 1987 to fill the unexpired term of the late 
sen ed zorinsky a democrat 
in announcing his appointment mrs orr said karnes was the best 
man for the job critics said mrs orr chose karnes because he 
wouldnt threaten her status in the state party she is a personal 
friend of president reagan and cochair of the gop national 
platform committee 
karnes was a virtual unknown but daub was among the gop 
regulars who sought the seat karnes had headed mrs orrs 
successful 1986 gubernatorial effort in omahadominated douglas 
county a traditional democratic stronghold 
daub 47 a fourterm congressman from the omahadominated 2nd 
district took the offensive several weeks ago 
at first the opponents bickered about voting records each 
accused the other of voting directly or indirectly for tax 
increases each effectively said the other was lying without using 
the word liar 
daub has more recently charged that karnes wouldnt fight for 
water projects in nebraska 
karnes says the tape recording of his statement during a debate 
made clear that he supported already planned projects but that 
water officials recognize that in the future we will not be able 
to start any new projects 
daub responded with a tv commercial using karnes statement 
contrasting it with a picture of cattle in a dry pasture and an 
announcer saying frightening as it it may seem a vote for dave 
karnes is a vote to cut off your own water 
those would be fighting words in the huge 3rd congressional 
district where cattle and crops are what counts and water is the

democrat paul simon says he is virtually 
certain michael dukakis will win the democratic presidential 
nomination but refuses to release his delegates in the unlikely 
event that michael dukakis stubs his toe between now and the 
convention 
the illinois senator who put his presidential campaign on hold 
a month ago said he would not surrender about 184 delegates 
committed to his campaign despite pressure to do so by supporters 
of jesse jackson 
chicago mayor eugene sawyer and some black lawmakers have urged 
simon to officially drop out of the presidential race jackson who 
finished second to simon in the illinois primary would then 
inherit the bulk of the states delegates 
im going to hold out until the california and new jersey 
primaries on june 7 and see whether i can still have an influence

a new method of determining chromosome 
abnormalities in a fetus as early as the eighth week of pregnancy 
may soon become much more widely available following a government 
study that shows it is safe and accurate a researcher says 
the technique is called chorionic villus sampling or cvs and 
can make an early identification of downs syndrome and other birth 
defects it is now restricted by the us food and drug 
administration to use by researchers on an experimental basis 
because the device used to obtain the sample is not approved for 
routine use 
because of the success of the nationwide study however the fda 
may decide to revise its restrictions and cvs may soon become much 
more widely available said one of the studys principal 
investigators dr laird jackson of thomas jefferson university in 
philadelphia jackson presented the findings in boston at the 
annual meeting of the american college of obstetricians and 
gynecologists 
he predicted that cvs might one day largely replace 
amniocentesis the current method of obtaining genetic information 
on a fetus 
cvs has been performed in the united states since 1983 but the 
government study is the first to carefully assess its safety and 
accuracy said dr george rhoads of the national institute of child 
health and human development which coordinated the research 
were encouraged rhoads said wednesday in an interview 
this was a diagnostic technique which is being used in the 
community and we wanted to assess its safety and accuracy so women 
could make more informed decisions 
in amniocentesis a small sample of the amniotic fluid that 
bathes the fetus is withdrawn fetal cells that have drifted into 
the amniotic fluid are extracted and analyzed for chromosome 
abnormalities 
that cannot be done until about the 16th week of pregnancy when 
enough amniotic fluid has been produced to allow some to be removed 
in chorionic villus sampling doctors snip off a tiny piece of 
chorionic villus tissue which grows from an enveloping membrane 
that eventually gives rise to the placenta the chorionic villus 
tissue while not part of the fetus is genetically identical to 
it so it will reveal any chromosome abnormalities carried by the 
fetus 
cvs can be done at seven to nine weeks into the pregnancy that 
allows mothers who choose to terminate their pregnancies to do so 
during the first trimester when abortion is safer and simpler 
cvs like amniocentesis is designed primarily to reveal 
chromosome abnormalities the most common of which is downs 
syndrome certain other genetic disorders can be identified but 
many birth defects and inherited diseases cannot be detected by any 
test 
the study was initiated partly to address the question of 
whether cvs would increase the risk of miscarriage which is known 
to be very small with amniocentesis 
the study compared 2278 women who received cvs and 671 who 
received amniocentesis it found that 2 percent of those who 
received cvs miscarried versus 13 percent for the others 
rhoads said that those numbers are not precise and the 
difference in risk could actually range from slightly higher than 
that to no difference at all 
the risk of amniocentesis is very low so even a slight increase 
in the risk of cvs could represent a doubling of the miscarriage 
risk rhoads said 
thats not very much risk but theres a little evidence that 
amniocentesis is safer he said 
jackson said that if there is a slight increase in risk it 
reflects the fact that not all doctors in the study were equally 
experienced at performing the procedure among those who had the 
most experience doing cvs the risk was virtually identical to the 
risk associated with amniocentesis he said 
i think thats a goal any prenatal unit can achieve jackson 
said in an interview the key in there is with good experience 
he said it has to be something they do every week

sunlight may make a dormant aids virus start to 
reproduce itself by activating a genetic trigger scientists 
reported today 
the results of new testtube experiments do not necessarily mean 
people infected with the aids virus should stay out of the sun 
scientists stressed 
but i certainly wouldnt tell somebody who had the virus or is 
seropositive possibly infected to go sit in one of these 
ultraviolet tanning spas said martin rosenberg of smith kline 
amp french laboratories 
rosenberg and smith kline colleagues from king of prussia pa 
and belgium report their work in the british journal nature 
they found that the virus grew faster in cells that had been 
exposed to ultraviolet light a component of sunlight and that 
exposing infected cells to ultraviolet light or sunlight activated 
a genetic trigger that controls virus reproduction 
since ultraviolet light damages a cells genetic material the 
work suggests that a dormant aids virus recognizes when an infected 
cell is under stress said rosenberg 
cells under attack are no longer a nice place to be latent 
so the virus reproduces and spreads elsewhere he said 
after the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
has infected a cell it can lie dormant for long periods before it 
begins to reproduce itself and spread to other cells 
scientists are trying to understand just what triggers a latent 
virus to start reproducing itself in hopes of finding ways to keep 
it dormant 
while most cells infected by the aids virus are deep within the 
body shielded from sunlight and its ultraviolet light the virus 
has been found in cells called langerhans cells that reside in the 
skin 
but so little is known about that kind of infection that the 
possible effect of sunlight is not exactly clear rosenberg said in 
an interview 
scientists do not know how often langerhans cells are infected 
or whether the virus spreads from there to elsewhere in the body 
he said 
donald belsito associate professor of dermatology at new york 
university said he knows of no experiments that show how much 
ultraviolet light reaches langerhans cells the minimum dose that 
produced an effect in the new experiments could reasonably be 
expected from natural sunlight exposure to reach the langerhans 
cells he said 
but aids researcher william haseltine of harvards danafarber 
cancer institute said more studies will be needed to determine any 
effect of sunlight on infected people 
it is far too early to draw any conclusions that would affect 
behavior he said in a telephone interview i dont think at 
this point people should be overly concerned that sunlight 
represents a substantial risk 
in one of the new experiments scientists exposed blood cells 
called tcells to ultraviolet light before infecting them with the 
aids virus they found evidence of viral reproduction four to five 
days after infection in the exposed cells significantly earlier 
than the seven to eight days required for untreated cells 
other experiments focused on a segment of genetic material 
called the long terminal repeat which regulates reproduction of 
the aids virus through genetic engineering researchers inserted 
the segment into an experimental cell line 
after the cells were exposed to ultravolet light the segment 
showed up to 150 times as much activity as it did when light was 
not used researchers reported activity was first detected two to 
four hours after irradiation reaching a peak 20 to 24 hours later 
the scientists also exposed the experimental cells to ordinary 
sunlight finding that a halfhour of exposure produced a 12fold 
increase in activity even 10 minutes was enough to cause a small 
increase they said

scientists say certain chemicals viewed 
as potential antidrunkenness drugs reversed anesthesia in tadpoles 
and rats and could lead to safer anesthetics and new medicines to 
save lives and money in hospital recovery rooms 
the researchers also said their studies are starting to solve a 
140yearold mystery how general anesthetics act on the brain to 
cause unconsciousness insensitivity to pain and memory loss 
if we understand how anesthetics work then we can develop 
anesthetics that are less toxic and safer but act on the same 
drug receptors on nerve cells in the brain said dr leonard 
firestone assistant professor of anesthesiology at the university 
of pittsburgh 
in addition studies like these may lead to development of 
safer drugs that reverse anesthesia and prevent some of the 
deaths of surgery patients 
firestone and debra yourick a university of kansas 
pharmacologisttoxicologist presented their findings wednesday 
during the annual meeting of the federation of american societies 
for experimental biology 
yourick and the kansas team led by richard tessel anesthetized 
rats and flipped them on their backs like limp dishrags tessel 
said rats that were then given a chemical called betacce regained 
consciousness and got up on all fours after only 19 minutes while 
other rats took 60 minutes to recover 
firestone knocked out tadpoles with a variety of anesthetics 
and found it took much longer for them to pass out if he first gave 
them a drug known as ro154513 
in 1986 government scientists raised hopes for eventual 
development of an antidrunkenness drug when they published studies 
showing that when drunken rats were given ro154513 the drug 
blocked the effect of alcohol on the brain allowing the rats to 
behave in a sober manner even though they still had high 
bloodalcohol levels 
but the drug can cause potentially fatal seizures and has other 
drawbacks so similar drugs must be developed to treat chronic 
alcoholics and to make anesthetized surgery patients regain 
consciousness more quickly said dr steven paul clinical 
neurosciences chief at the national institute of mental health in 
bethesda md 
betacce and ro154513 were developed to help scientists learn 
how anesthetics work the kansas and pittsburgh studies and similar 
research by paul and his colleagues found that the drugs reverse 
anesthesia by attaching to a certain type of receptor on nerve 
cells in the brain 
sedatives named benzodiazepines including valium and librium 
bind to the same receptors to calm the transmission of nerve 
impulses anesthetics attach to the same receptors to cause 
unconsciousness and memory loss although pain insensitivity may be 
produced by another reaction tessel said 
betacce and ro154513 also bind to the same receptors 
suggesting they reverse anesthesia by replacing the anesthetics on 
those receptors 
yourick and tessel said that differs from the traditional theory 
that anesthetics work by disrupting nerve cell membranes rather 
than by attaching to a particular target or receptor 
if similar safer antianesthetics can be developed we could 
administer one of these agents and speed their surgery patients 
recovery from anesthesia and save lives yourick said 
every single patient who gets general anesthesia could benefit 
from having their unconsciousness reversed as soon as surgery 
ends because unconscious patients are more likely to stop 
breathing vomit into their lungs or die from other problems 
firestone said 
time in the recovery room is very costly so drugs to 
reverse anesthesia quickly also would save patients money said 
donald miller a coauthor of the kansas study

widespread arrests in the palestinian uprising 
have crowded israels prisons with nearly 5000 new inmates and 
raised accusations that suspects are held unlawfully humiliated 
and sometimes beaten 
at least 1700 of the inmates have been sentenced to up to six 
months in jail without specific charges or an appearance before a 
judge this is done under emergency laws still in use 43 years 
after they were imposed by britain during its mandate over 
palestine 
israel has opened or converted five prison camps to house the 
burgeoning inmate population nearly double the 5000 palestinians 
jailed before the protests began dec 8 against israeli occupation 
of the west bank and gaza strip 
lawyers and civil rights advocates say facilities still are 
overcrowded and that toilets drinking water showers and other 
amenities are in short supply 
the number arrested is just way beyond anything anybody had 
planned for said joshua schoffman of the association for civil 
rights an organization similar to the american civil liberties 
union 
felicia langer an israeli lawyer who defends palestinian 
clients said so many people have been arrested that inmates are 
referred to not by their names but only by numbers assigned to them 
at the time of arrest 
they are calling them according to their numbers they have no 
names she said they announce no 70 is imprisoned for six 
months no 30 is imprisoned 
israeli army officials have said every effort is made to treat 
prisoners with dignity 
a army spokeswoman who cannot be identified under law said 
every charge of mistreatment is investigated and most complaints 
are found to be baseless she said she could not give specific 
figures 
schoffman said civil rights association lawyers who visited two 
camps found serious overcrowding and lack of basic facilities 
but no evidence of beatings but he added that the lawyers were not 
allowed to see areas of camps where suspects are interrogated 
mona rishmawi a palestinian lawyer trained in egypt maintained 
that beating takes place regularly during interrogation she and 
ms langer charged that the dahariya prison camp in the west bank 
is notorious for beatings 
salim albus a 19yearold palestinian told an arab reporter 
that he was beaten at dahariya in late march after refusing to 
curse plo leader yasser arafat albus said he was released after 
18 days the time a prisoner can be held by law before he must be 
charged or put under administrative detention 
reporters have seen arrested palestinians ordered to stand for 
hours with their heads bowed or heads leaning against a wall 
ms rishmawi said prisoners that she visited in dahariya were 
forced to stand bowed before prison guards 
humiliation is the rule its unbelievable she said 
in most cases palestinian prisoners are kept in tents 
surrounded by fences or barbed wire ketziot in israels negev 
desert and dahariya have just been put up to house palestinian 
prisoners and three other prisons have been expanded or converted 
for the purpose 
many of the prisoners are youths arrested for stone throwing 
but palestinian lawyers and doctors also are among those jailed 
the englishlanguage jerusalem post reported recently that the 
army moved prisoners under age 16 to separate facilities after a 
12yearold inmate was sexually abused by other prisoners 
the army will not discuss the numbers of arrests but defense 
minister yitzhak rabin told the cabinet in late april that 4900 
palestinians were being held and 1700 were under administrative 
detention the jerusalem post reported on april 29 that 8000 
palestinians had been arrested since december 
some of the inmates were sentenced in proceedings where as many 
as 50 people were tried at one time 
mrs langer suggested the number of detainees also was growing 
because the army canceled regulations requiring that administrative 
detention orders issued by three regional commanders be 
reviewed by military judges within 36 hours 
they have returned to the original infamous regulations of 
1945 mrs langer said referring to british orders that jewish 
settlers condemned as harsh and inhuman in the years before the 
state of israel was established in 1948 
two court cases have been filed against the government and both 
are now before the supreme court one challenges the emergency laws 
and the other maintains that transfer of prisoners from occupied 
territories to prisons inside israel violates international law 
but lawyers complained that its difficult to pursue individual 
cases despite procedures for appeal to a military tribunal and 
israeli courts because no specific charges are announced 
evidence is submitted in secret charges are submitted in 
secret how can you appeal asked ms rishmawi

the government said 15 tons of norwegian 
heavy water which can be used in nuclear reactors and in 
making nuclear weapons was illegally diverted in 1983 to an 
unknown destination 
the foreign ministry said on wednesday that its investigation 
had confirmed media reports that the shipment intended for a west 
german firm did not reach its licensed destination of frankfurt 
the oslo newspaper verdens gang reported april 21 that the heavy 
water was flown on a liberianregistered west african airlines 
plane via basel switzerland to dubai then probably to a nuclear 
reactor in bombay india 
norway does not allow the export of heavy water to countries 
that have not signed the international nuclear nonprolification 
agreement including india 
the ministry said it had so far determined only that the heavy 
water was sent by air freight to basel 
the prosecuting authority will be requested to start 
investigations in norway via diplomatic channels west germany will 
be asked to to do the same in order to reveal possible punishable 
offenses the ministry said 
it said the heavy water was sold by norsk hydro norways only 
producer of heavy water to the west german firm rohstoff einfuhr 
of duesseldorf the ministry said the firm had stated that the 
heavy water was for scientific use in west germany 
norsk hydro and norwegian authorities may have been tricked by 
rohstoff einfuhr a company owned by alfred hempel a former world 
war ii wehrmacht officer the verdens gang report said 
it quoted spokesman helmut swien of alfred hempel of 
duesseldorf the parent company of rohstoff einfuhr as saying 
you must understand that i cannot tell you who our customers are 
because of business reasons 
heavy water or deuterium oxide is used as a coolant in some 
nuclear reactors but it can also be used to produce plutonium for 
use in nuclear arms india has several nuclear reactors that use 
heavy water

a mysterious paralyzing disease that occurs in 
tropical climates may be caused by a virus that also triggers a 
rare form of blood cancer according to a report today 
the virus first isolated in 1980 is called human tcell 
lymphomaleukemia virus type 1 or htlvi it causes cancer of a 
variety of white blood cells known as t cells 
recently doctors have found that people with a mysterious 
disease called chronic progressive myelopathy or tropical spastic 
paraparesis sometimes show signs in their blood of infection with 
htlvi 
in the latest study doctors found direct evidence of the virus 
in these people strengthening the suspicion that htlvi can be one 
cause of the disease 
htlvi appears to be causally associated with many cases of 
otherwise unexplained myelopathy in patients from the tropics 
they wrote 
the research was directed by dr satyakam bhagavati of the state 
university of new york health science center in brooklyn it was 
published in the new england journal of medicine 
health experts say htlvi is spreading among drug addicts in the 
united states surveys estimate that about two of every 10000 
units of blood used for transfusions contain the virus blood bank 
officials have said they will start checking donations for the 
virus when screening tests are available 
clusters of chronic progressive myelopathy occur in tropical 
parts of the world including the caribbean where the virus is 
also relatively common the disease results in weakness numbness 
and gradual paralysis of the legs 
in their study doctors found direct evidence of the virus in 12 
patients who also had antibodies to htlvi 
in an accompanying editorial drs bruce j brew and richard w 
price of memorial sloankettering cancer center in new york said 
its puzzling why the disease is rare even where the virus is 
widespread 
even though there are other examples of low disease rates from 
common viruses they wrote it nonetheless raises the question of 
what other factors contribute to the development of the disease

prosecutors plan to push for a new trial of 
extremist lyndon larouche and his associates in a federal 
conspiracy case that continued for four months until a judge 
declared a mistrial 
we will press for a new trial and we will get this case to a 
verdict assistant us attorney john markham said after district 
judge robert keetons decision wednesday 
larouche six aides and five affiliated organizations are 
charged with raising money for larouches 1984 presidential 
campaign through credit card and loan fraud and with conspiring to 
stymie a grand jury investigation of the alleged fraud 
the slowmoving trial began in december among other twists 
defense lawyers charged the government with deliberately 
withholding information including a memo in which two key figures 
in the irancontra scandal discussed alleged infiltration of 
larouche groups 
keeton excused four jurors who complained about the length and 
conduct of the case forcing him to call a mistrial 
i find that it is clear that these four jurors will be unable 
to continue to serve as fair and impartial jurors after midjuly 
keeton said there is not the slightest possibility that we will 
complete this trial in that time 
the judge had to declare a mistrial because there were only 10 
jurors remaining and court rules require at least 12 unless both 
sides agree to continue with fewer defense lawyers refused to do 
so 
in a statement larouche charged the dismissal was caused by a 
twomonth delay for hearings on whether prosecutors deliberately 
withheld information 
the delays which led to the dismissal of the jury were caused 
by substantial acts of misconduct by the government including 
withholding of information and the manufacturing of evidence 
larouche said 
and the delays were caused by the need to have hearings on the 
issue of government misconduct 
larouche who has accused some western leaders of being soviet 
spies says the charges against him were organized by the reagan 
administration because he refused to support aid to the nicaraguan 
contras 
he is charged with one count of conspiracy for allegedly 
ordering supporters to destroy records and refuse to cooperate with 
investigators all six aides and the five organizations also are 
charged with conspiracy and four of the groups are charged with 
fraud 
three other larouche aides named in the indictment were granted 
later trials and three are fugitives 
keeton criticized both sides for giving grossly wrong 
estimates of how long the trial would last 
he also said aggressive behavior by defense lawyers in the 
presence of the jury was a factor in his declaring a mistrial a 
comment that likely will be at the center of the governments 
response to defense arguments 
defense lawyers sought to have five jurors excused because of 
their complaints keeton over the objections of markham excused 
four 
if keeton orders a new trial defense lawyer said they would 
appeal to the 1st us circuit court of appeals attorneys for both 
sides said the earliest a new trial could begin would be in the 
fall 
the prosecutor was beginning the portion of the case focusing on 
the alleged conspiracy to obstruct justice when keeton ordered 
hearings into possible government misconduct and infiltration of 
larouche groups 
during those proceedings the government declassified a memo in 
which retired air force maj richard secord told thennational 
security council aide oliver north about an associates efforts to 
get info against larouche 
a search of fbi files based on that disclosure led to the 
discovery of another classified document in which three 
intelligence operatives said top level cia and fbi officials had 
asked them to infiltrate larouche groups 
larouche presidential campaign spokesman dana scanlon said a 
larouche organization called the constitutional defense fund had 
spent more than 2 million in legal fees and some administrative 
costs on the boston case 
although she did not have figures for march through the first 
week of may scanlon said the funds costs had averaged almost 
200000 in january and february 
markham declined comment on the governments costs and referred 
a caller to us attorney frank l mcnamara jr who could not be 
reached after office hours wednesday

white men one of whom flashed a policelike badge she has since 
refused to tell her story to a state grand jury investigating the 
case 
attorney general robert abrams the special prosecutor for the 
case issued a statement saying all aspects of this case 
including reports that tawana brawley may have been seen in 
newburgh are under continuing investigation 
according to the news the first runaway incident allegedly

marijuana drinking beer and partying with a girlfriend and two 
men the report said 
miss brawleys mother glenda tracked her down at the house of 
the teenager and smacked her repeatedly with her fists the report 
said 
neither disappearance was reported to police 
the news said mrs brawley could not be reached to comment on 
the report but the rev al sharpton who has advised miss brawley 
not to cooperate with the officials investigating her case said he 
could not confirm the reports 
if anything it says tawana came from a family who cared and 
if she got out of line they attempted to take care of it he 
said 
sharpton who said he watched the wcbstv report with the 
brawley family in wappingers falls said he and family attorneys 
alton maddox jr and c vernon mason planned to hold a news 
conference today to comment on the reports 
in the wcbstv report a witness who was not identified and 
spoke on camera with his face concealed said he knew miss brawley 
saw her at the party and talked to her there 
he also said that during part of the fourday period when miss 
brawley claimed she was held captive she spent time with a former 
boyfriend and drug dealer identified by wcbstv as jason 
chico colon 
several newspapers have quoted other friends of miss brawley as 
saying they thought her claims of sexual abuse and racial assault 
were exaggerated or untrue

in a pair of mountaineering firsts 
multinational climbing teams scaled mount everest simultaneously 
from two directions today and made a live television broadcast from 
atop the worlds highest mountain 
signals relayed via satellite from a small video camera attached 
to the helmet of japanese climber susumu nakamura showed a 
panoramic view of the deep blue sky and rough snowcovered terrain 
at the top of the world 
gasping from the thin air and with frost on their eyebrows 10 
climbers from nepal china and japan in bright red blue and yellow 
mountaineering gear congratulated each other they erected on the 
summit a string of brightly colored banners during the live 
broadcast monitored in tokyo 
nakamuras speciallymade camera is so full of sensitive 
equipment that if abandoned on the chinese side of the mountain 
it could be viewed as a violation of western laws governing the 
transfer of high technology to communist nations said hiroshi 
yamazaki of japans nihon television corp or ntv which paid most 
of the expeditions 125 million bill 
nbc news sunrise monitored in new york began its 6 am edt 
show with footage of the climbers celebrating at the summit 
chinese television also broadcast part of the climb the live 
broadcast was the longest ever in china 
the expedition involving more than 200 people from japan nepal 
and china is the largest assault ever on everest one member of 
the japanese team hidetaka mizukoshi died of heart failure during 
the climb 
climbing began last month to celebrate the 35th anniversary of 
the first everest conquest by new zealander sir edmund hillary and 
sherpa guide tenzing norgay more than 192 people have since scaled 
the 29028foot mountain with 13 climbing more than once 
in this climb however members of two teams met at the summit 
after climbing simultaneously from the mountains north face in 
china and the south face in nepal the first such rendezvous in 
history 
this is the greatest event in the history of climbing said 
kunga sherpa leader of one of the nepalese base camp setups 
on the summit a cameraman asked one of the japanese climbers 
how he felt and he gaspingly replied i feel great 
ntv is japans largest commercial network and it too is 
celebrating its 35th anniversary 
as seen in japan the broadcast was one technical blitz after 
another 
aside from the broadcast at the summit the ntv producers were 
able to switch their broadcasts from the base camp on the south 
side of the mountain to the north side 
and at one point a japanese broadcaster held up a document that 
had been received in a base camp by facsimile transmission from 
tokyo relatives of the climbers were in the ntv studio in tokyo 
and were able to speak directly to the climbers atop the mountain 
during an earlier live broadcast chinese television showed 
members of the two teams approaching the peak from the south and 
north painstakingly making their way toward the summit 
the chinese broadcast said tibetan climber cering doje and 
nepals ang lhakpa sherpa the first climbers to reach the summit 
waited along with noboru yamada of japan in a small hut for others 
to arrive 
this is an exciting moment the motherland thanks you the 
chinese people thank you the chinese newscaster said senior 
leader deng xiaopeng called the television station to congratulate 
the great pioneers of all three countries 
the 10 climbers at the top then filled small bottles with 
samples of snow and spilled whiskey on the ground to honor 
climbers who have died in previous attempts 
soon after the 10 were shown beginning their descent to try 
another first three climbers who reached the summit from the north 
will descend southward and three who came from the south will 
descend to the north

police detained more than 25 
opposition leaders who had gathered to support workers on a hunger 
strike and held them for about two hours a spokesman for the 
opposition parties said 
a rally planned for wednesday in support of the striking workers 
did not take place demonstrations in nicaragua are banned unless 
they have government approval 
authorities told the leaders only that the police action was 
to frustrate an attempt to violate the laws of the country 
jaime bonilla of the independent liberal party said 
the interior ministry on tuesday barred the privately owned 
radio mundial and the roman catholic station radio catolica from 
broadcasting news for eight days it also closed radio corporacion 
for 24 hours for airing false news about the strike 
leaders from 14 opposition parties ranging from the communists 
to the rightist social christians had gathered at the office of 
the social democrat party 
they were to go from there to the general workers federation 
building a mile away where more than 30 workers were staging a 
hunger strike for higher pay the strike continued today for a 10th 
day 
as the leaders were about to leave police in military and 
civilian vehicles took them into custody lorena obando a member 
of the social democrat party said 
alma morales an interior ministry spokeswoman said the group 
was invited to meet with commander doris tijerino chief of the 
sandinista police 
police grabbed two others social christian leaders agustin 
jarquin anaya and armando guadamuz near the federation building 
and pushed them into a police vehicle guadamuz had been speaking 
with journalists a block from the building 
this is the repressive custom of the sandinista front 
guadamuz said before police led him away they are violent by 
tradition 
police cordoned off the federation building 
at a news conference late wednesday bonilla said opposition 
leaders who are in the national assembly and have immunity from 
prosecution were released before reaching a police station 
the rest he said were taken to a place called palo alto 
where they asked us our complete names home addresses age 
occupation and position in our political parties 
some of us were taken to jails and others to interrogation 
rooms which are more comfortable bonilla added 
tijerino ordered them released he said 
javier lopez a highranking police official was quoted in 
newspapers as saying the leaders were detained because they did 
not have authorization to carry out that mobilization 
it was unclear if he referred to the visit to the hunger 
strikers or the planned rally 
construction workers and car mechanics walked off their jobs 
feb 25 to demand higher salaries and better working conditions 
the federation a coalition of socialist unions says 4500 workers 
are striking interior minister tomas borge has said there are only 
400 people off the job 
erick ramirez leader of a faction of the social christian 
party said the parties have been holding activities in favor of 
the workers on hunger strike because their demands are just and 
because of the difficult economic situation that the workers in 
this country are living 
radio catolica had been closed for almost two years for failing 
to broadcast ortegas yearend message on dec 31 1985 the only 
opposition newspaper la prensa was closed june 26 1986 both 
were allowed to reopen last october

fire in a 62story downtown building showered 
broken glass on firefighters today and sent orange flames and 
plumes of thick black smoke shooting out of the citys tallest 
skyscraper 
the steady stream of heatblasted glass made the firefighting 
effort particularly dangerous capt mike bowers said the glass 
falling is severing our hose lines and we cant send 
firefighters to replace them because theyll get severed 
firefighters extinguished the blaze at the first interstate bank 
early this morning after it burned 3 hours spreading flames and 
smoke as it snaked upward inspector ed reed called it the citys 
worst highrise fire 
thousands of onlookers gathered downtown to take pictures and 
scoop up singed papers that fluttered to the street through broken 
windows 
gary stratton 20 of los angeles snared a singed page from 
what appeared to be an office manual and a few halfburned 
receipts 
ill definitely be keeping this as a souvenir stratton said 
people craned their necks as helicopter spotlights illuminated 
bright orange flames and plumes of thick smoke shooting out broken 
windows 
inside firefighters faced a hellish mix of heat and smoke 
we were on of the first fire companies up on the 12th floor 
where the fire was fire capt jeff marcus said today on cbstvs 
this morning we used the door as a barricade to keep the 
heat from coming into the stairwell 
water hitting the hot metal girders and pipes sent clouds of 
steam spewing at firefighters hampering visibility and spreading 
severe heat reed said 
fire crews wearing breathing gear trudged up closed streets to 
the blaze raging through the headquarters of the states 
thirdlargest bank evoking images of troops headed into battle 
the drone of helicopter rotors was mixed with the whine of 
sirens the sound of shattering glass and the roar of the flames a 
dozen stories overhead 
this is one of the alltime big ones fire capt steve 
varney said the whole square block building is just full of 
smoke and heat 
everything that was burnable burned down it was just metal 
and that was red hot it looked like dantes inferno 
the fire erupted shortly after 1030 pm wednesday as workers 
installed piping for an overhead sprinkler system police lines 
kept the crowds back and traffic snarled as motorists parked five 
and six cars deep at the curb

dancers and immigration officials early today as he became the last 
illegal alien in the united states to apply for legal residency

honor of becoming last applicant 
theyre fighting over being the last one said pamela 
legates chief legalization officer in the amnesty office theyd 
like to be the last person for historical purposes

for amnesty said sarah kim a legalization officer 
for the entire year 2082 illegal aliens from 61 countries

british and soviet media poked fun at president 
reagans reported belief in astrology but newspapers in other 
countries quoted him as saying the stars had played no role in his 
policies 
white house watchers wild about nancy reagan the 
stargazer blared the headline in wednesdays daily telegraph 
which reported that washington was abuzz with claims nancy 
really believes what the stars foretell 
newspapers in italy west germany and sweden gave relatively 
straightforward coverage to the presidents denial tuesday that his 
decisions and progarms were influenced by astrology 
british and soviet media also made fun of former reagan 
administration officials who have revealed juicy white house gossip 
there is no wrath like that of a former reagan aide 
apparently said britains independent newspaper or to put it 
another way former reagan aides will do anything to get their 
memoirs on the bestseller list 
donald t regan former white house chief of staff reportedly 
asserts in a forthcoming book that mrs reagan regularly consulted 
astrologers in shaping the presidents schedule 
the tabloid daily mirror devoted almost an entire inside page to 
the hubbub it also listed under the banner headline star 
struck the famous people who purportedly sought insight from 
astrologers 
among them were albert einstein queen elizabeth i and napoleon 
bonaparte 
einstein once wrote that astrology was a science in itself 
that taught me many things according to daily mirror 
columnist louise montgomery 
elizabeth i the 16thcentury english monarch rarely acted 
without the advice of astrologer john dee and french emperor 
napoleon commissioned at least two astrological charts and placed 
his trust in the movement of the stars she added 
a sober headline in the independent said reagan takes a dim 
view of stargazing tales while the tabloid daily express banner 
headline proclaimed ronnie and nancys starstruck white house 
in sweden aftonbladet bannered the story saying reagan 
governed by the stars while the liberal expressen had a large 
picture of the presidential couple and a headline reading nancy 
whats the stars predicting for today 
tass wondering in a dispatch what the stars are telling reagan 
it is difficult to say what the may night sky studded with 
stars predicted to the president but it hardly predicted that he 
would have to speak about the role of astrology in the politics of 
the usa the official soviet news agency said 
tass characterized as evasive reagans denial that the stars 
influence policy decisions now more americans are asking 
themselves may it be true that the president determines the 
countrys political course with the help of the stars

even before three freed french hostages made it 
home premier jacques chirac was peppered with reproach for dealing 
secretly with terrorists likely worsening chances for remaining 
and future hostages 
nine americans three britons and six others were still believed 
to be captive in lebanon 
after a morning of scattered sharp reaction interior minister 
charles pasqua today retorted to reporters 
we have not accorded any funds of any sort to anyone not a 
franc not a dollar not a deutschmark not a yen 
most french politicians publicly hailed the release calling it 
above politics even though it came four days before chirac faces 
incumbent francois mitterrand in presidential elections 
but jeanmarie le pen of the extreme right national front who 
polled 144 percent in firstround voting said he was struck that 
everyone cried victory over a defeat for france 
there is the other side of this a death and the price that i 
would like to know he said there is only one way to deal with 
terrorists that used in ouvea 
as the hostages were returned from beirut today troops stormed 
insurgents on the french new caledonian island of ouvea to free 22 
gendarmes held hostage two members of a french assault team and 15 
melanesian kidnappers were killed according to bernard pons 
french minister for overseas territories 
a fourth french hostage in lebanon michel seurat is believed 
to have died of cancer in captivity 
harsh reaction came from britain prime minister margaret 
thatcher refuses to treat with terrorists peter templemorris 
member of parliament and a lebanon specialist in thatchers 
conservative party said 
no responsible nation and no responsible government and i say 
that directly to the french government and the french people 
should deal with terrorism 
in an interview with the british broadcasting corp he went on 
i very much disapprove of the french action i think its 
corrupt both in electoral terms andgeneral terms i think its 
thoroughly bad 
he blamed the deal on frances system which on sunday pits a 
president and his prime minister against one another for the 
presidency 
by chiracs approach he said governments throughout the 
world had better give way to terrorism and let the terrorists 
completely take over 
john waite cousin of terry waite the church of england envoy 
detained since jan 20 1987 echoed templemorris criticism 
unfortunately when deals are done by countries like france 
then others position is made worse because they are isolated 
because we are the only country it seems who is not doing deals 
david owen leader of the social democratic party called the 
french deal brazen and cynical 
chirac confronted the charges after greeting the hostages 
outside paris on nationwide television he declared 
we have never ceased to act with dignity and honor conforming 
strictly to values shared with other countries adhering strictly 
the grand principles of our foreign policy to those of our 
friends 
pierre beregovoy a socialist and mitterrands campaign 
director praised conditions that do honor to our country 
but among ordinary frenchmen many private remarks reflected 
that of a senior western diplomat i wonder how much he paid 
in a brief but pointed statement the us state department said 
it was awaiting details but added we would be concerned by any 
sign that concessions were made we believe concessions encourage 
future kidnappings and could prolong captivity of other hostages 
another british conservative legislator hugo summerson urged 
summoning the french ambassador for an explanation the french 
have always looked after their own interests in a rather 
selfish way he said 
chirac himself refused to discuss negotiations leading to the 
release of the three the last french hostages in lebanon since 
june 1986 proiranian groups have freed 10 frenchmen 
weeks ago sources close to chirac reported that france agreed 
to repay to iran the remaining twothirds of a disputed 1 billion 
loan contracted with the deposed shah and that iran was prepared 
to broker a release 
the most persistent speculation never confirmed was that 
france also agreed to alter the balance of arms supplied to iraq 
and iran and to add a cash payment 
chiracs aides confronting criticism headon remarked 
privately that the united states might draw a lesson from france 
the french premier personally oversaw negotiations working with 
pasqua and repeatedly pressed senior iranian officials who were 
instrumental in obtaining the release 
the remaining hostages include nine americans believed to be 
prisoners of islamic zealots in lebanon the longest held is terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
who was kidnapped march 16 1985 
circuitous secret manuevers including arms sales to iran came 
to light dramatically in november 1986 and weakened the reagan 
administrations position 
french political analysts are divided on the effect of the 
timing days before an election which polls suggest chirac would 
lose 
as soon as he announced the hostage release at a campaign rally 
in strasbourg his followers began chanting were going to win 
were going to win 
but some analysts predicted a hostile backlash from people who 
suspected chirac himself had influenced the timing to give himself 
a badly needed boost in the final stretch 
islamic fundamentalists may have decided to give the 
conservative candidate an edge because mitterrand is regarded as a 
close friend of israel but it was chirac who first negotiated arms 
sales to iraq in his previous term as premier in the 1970s

a french assault team today stormed 
a cave in this french pacific territory and freed 22 gendarmes and 
a prosecutor held hostage by melanesian separatists an official 
said 17 people were killed 
bernard pons minister for overseas territories in the 
conservative government of premier jacques chirac of france said 
the dead included two members of the assault team and 15 kidnappers 
he also said two members of the assault team were seriously 
injured 
pons said the hostages were freed after a particularly violent 
battle in the nearly sevenhour assault on a network of caves in 
ouvea an island off the northeast coast of new caledonia 
the assault team attacked the cave with tear gas forcing most 
of the approximately 30 kidnappers out pons told a news conference 
after returning from ouvea where he had traveled for the operation 
the hostages freed themselves from their handcuffs before the 
attack after a key was smuggled to them by capt philippe legorjus 
chief of an antiterrorism squad 
legorjus had been captured during earlier hostage negotiations 
with the separatists then freed to act as an gobetween with 
french authorities legorjus made several trips to and from the 
caves during negotiations and was told that the hostages would be 
killed if he did not return 
legorjus also smuggled to the caves two pistols with which 
hostages defended themselves during the attack 
profiting from the smoke created by tear gas bombs the 
hostages were able to escape through a chimney in the back of the 
cave pons said 
police said the injured were taken to a hospital in noumea 
capital of this island territory 1300 miles northeast of australia 
in paris defense minister andre giraud said in a television 
interview that the kidnappers chief was among those killed 
giraud told french radio that the attack was ordered by chirac 
with approval from president francois mitterrand when negotiations 
with the kidnappers stalled 
the situation inside the cave had become extremely 
dangerous giraud said in any case it was entirely 
intolerable that representatives of the forces of order might be 
held hostage 
jeanmarie tjibaou president of the kanak socialist national 
liberation front the main melanesian separatist organization said 
the operation was a hard blow for the kanak people 
this will not stop the determination of the kanak people in 
their demand for independence tjibaou told the associated press 
by telephone from his home in hienghene at the northern end of new 
caledonia 
asked if he expected to be arrested tjibaou replied its 
always possible it would be completely logical since the 
government thinks there is no political claim but only a terrorist 
band 
authorities had imposed a near total news blackout for several 
days cut communications with ouvea and would not allow journalists 
to go there 
the melanesian kidnappers had demanded negotiations toward 
independence for new caledonia the french pacific island territory 
fifteen of the gendarmes had been held since they were kidnapped 
from a police station on ouvea april 22 four gendarmes were killed 
in that attack 
legorjus and seven other hostages were seized april 27 as they 
sought to negotiate the release of the other hostages 
the militants were demanding that french troops be removed from 
ouvea and that a mediator be sent to arrange a referendum on 
independence for new caledonia a french territory since 1853 they 
also had demanded the cancellation of elections which took place 
during scattered violence april 24 
as a result of that election mitterrand and chirac will face 
each other in a presidential runoff election in france on sunday 
new caledonia has become an issue in the campaign 
of new caledonias 145000 inhabitants 43 percent are native 
melanesian known as kanaks most of whom desire independence 
european settlers make up 36 percent of the population with the 
rest asian and polynesian this group generally would prefer to 
remain part of france

warshipescorted convoys 
moved through the persian gulf without incident but us warships 
that prowled the waterway were still on alert for mines and 
possible iranian attack 
its very quiet out there lt cmdr mark van dyke said 
wednesday on the 3700ton guidedmissile frigate that played a 
pivotal role in fierce fighting with iranian warships two weeks ago 
a usescorted tanker convoy arrived off the coast of kuwait on 
wednesday morning without incident after clearing through the 
narrow strait of hormuz gateway to the gulf the day before navy 
officials reported 
the two kuwaiti tankers reflagged as american vessels the 
townsend and the sea isle city were escorted by the destroyer uss 
merrill and the guided missile frigate uss sides the tankers were 
left in international waters off kuwait 
iran has threatened revenge for the april 18 battle in which 
washington claimed three iranian vesssels were sunk three others 
were hit by missiles and bombs 
adm william j crowe jr chairman of the us joint chiefs of 
staff told a pentagon media pool aboard the command ship uss 
coronado on tuesday that tehrans threats of revenge are taken very 
seriously 
they have considerable capability and they have missile 
capability which we are always concerned about crowe said during 
a surprise visit to the gulf he came to tour some of the 28 ships 
plying the vital oil trade route 
shipping executives said a civilian helicopter pilot reported 
tuesday seeing two ships thought to be iranian between das island 
an oil terminal off the united arab emirates and the iranowned 
sassan platform that us forces destroyed april 18 
his report raised fears the ships were sowing mines 
crowe met with senior bahrain government officials on wednesday 
the second day of a visit to the persian gulf where iran and iraq 
have been at war since september 1980 
although no new mines have been found since the april 18 sea 
battle minesweepers and lookouts in the bow of the williams and 
other passing ships kept lookouts on constant duty to survey the 
placid turquoise sea for fear iran may use mines to even the 
balance after its naval losses 
i dont care if one of my boys forces us to reverse speed for 
a dead sheep or cow says cmdr edward mann captain of this 
warship i still praise him for spotting it because it shows he 
his doing his job 
dead sheep and cattle with their four hoofs poking through the 
calm waters have provided a scary imitation of the mines the 
united states blames iran for floating in international waters 
one mine put on display yesterday aboard the coronado recovered 
in september from the minelaying iran ajr by the us navy has 
deadly hooflike prongs that can detonate 250 pounds of explosives 
crowe visited the badly damaged 3700ton guided missile frigate 
uss samuel b roberts which is in a gulf drydock undergoing 
repairs to pay tribute to its crew for its heroic effort in saving 
the ship from sinking last month after it nudged a mine as it tried 
to back away ten crew members were injured 
the incident prompted the us attack on iranian oil platforms 
april 18 which in turn led to the naval skirmish with iran 
as this warship sailed back into the central gulf to resume 
patrol duties after a brief port stop its officers and men seemed 
more concerned about mines than iranian attacks 
you can even plant one of those from a dhow said executive 
officer lt cmdr wally bloss of the bowshaped arab fishing boats 
that dot the steamy horizon 
while the pentagon has still not decided if iran actually fired 
silkworms at us ships in the april 18 engagement the williams 
crew shows little doubt 
they have ordered 1000 tshirts with the slogan on the front 
persian gulf escort service the back displays an empty tequila 
bottle with the words we drank the bottle but we didnt eat the 
worm 
president reagan has warned tehran of strikes against coastal 
silkworm missile batteries if they were ever fired at american 
ships but the pentagon says it lacks definite proof iran used them 
in the daylong battle

iraq said its warplanes attacked an oil 
tanker off the iranian coast today and a new convoy of 
usflagged kuwaiti tankers escorted by american warships headed 
south down the persian gulf 
the reported iraqi raid was the first in a week there was no 
immediate confirmation from independent shipping sources 
the convoy the fourth in the past week left kuwait as the us 
navy accelerated its escort operations in an effort to make up for 
delays caused by last months mine threat and a oneday naval 
battle with iran 
iraqs official news agency said a large naval target the 
iraqi term for a tanker was attacked this morning the report was 
monitored in cyprus 
it quoted a military spokesman as saying the planes scored a 
direct and effective hit on the unidentified vessel and 
returned safely to base 
the raid was aimed at depriving the iranian regime of its oil 
revenues which are used for aggressive purposes the spokesman 
was quoted as saying 
it was the first raid claimed by iraq since april 29 when it 
said two iranian tankers were attacked by its jets the day before 
but those raids also have not been verified by independent sources 
the last confirmed iraqi air strike on iranian shipping was 
march 30 when the 259000ton cypriot tanker anax was set on fire 
by missiles 
iraq and iran have been at war since september 1980 more than 
400 ships have been hit or damaged since the socalled tanker 
war broke out in early 1984 
the convoy the 29th this year and the 51st since the united 
states began escorting 11 reflagged kuwaiti tankers last july 
included the 79999ton oil products tankers chesapeake city and 
ocean city 
the ships had reached kuwait in a northbound convoy april 29 
they left a few hours after another convoy arrived in kuwait 
wednesday 
the movements have been stepped up in the past week after 
falling behind schedule because of irans mining of international 
waters and the subsequent naval clashes between us and iranian 
forces april 18 
shipping executives who reported the latest convoy did not 
name the escort warships and us officials were not available 
the warships were believed to be the destroyer merrill and the 
guided missile frigate john h sides which had accompanied 
wednesdays convoy to kuwait us warships do not normally enter 
kuwaiti waters

the government today appealed 
a court order that opened segregated beaches in the southern city 
of port elizabeth to all races 
the port elizabeth supreme court ruled wednesday that the city 
council acted without proper authority in 1966 when it passed a 
resolution proclaiming the beaches segregated 
the court declared the beaches in the countrys fifth largest 
city open to all races some blacks immediately went to previously 
whites only beaches and ran triumphantly along the sand 
but today constitutional development minister chris heunis and 
the administrator of cape province gene louw filed court papers 
seeking to appeal the decision the documents said the beaches 
should remain segregated until the court rules on their appeal 
city councilor graham richards who filed the application 
calling for desegregated beaches said louw was using procedures 
of the court as a purely political maneuver 
heunis and president pw botha have taken a middle ground on 
the volatile issue of beach apartheid contending that some 
beaches should be integrated while others remain reserved for 
whites 
most beaches in the two largest coastal cities durban and cape 
town are open to all races blacks are barred from many beaches in 
smaller communities 
in january 1987 port elizabeths beaches figured in a political 
confrontation between botha and the rev alan hendrickse leader of 
the mixedrace chamber of parliament 
hendrickse waded into the surf in a wellpublicized defiance of 
apartheid laws he later apologized to botha for causing any 
offense to the president lowering his credibility among his 
constituents 
somebody owes me an apology hendrickse said wednesday in 
parliament after learning of the court ruling 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

nobel laureate saul bellow has decided to sell 
all rough draft material from his 1970 novel mr sammlers 
planet in an unprecedented auction that is making librarians and 
scholars uneasy 
the four handwritten notebooks typescript galleys and all 
papers relating to the book will go on the block june 7 at 
sothebys it will be the first archive of a major living authors 
published work to be auctioned and the first manuscript material 
sold by bellow 
the presale estimate of the collections value is between 
60000 and 100000 according to david redden head of sothebys 
books and manuscripts department 
redden said it is difficult to evaluate because the sale will be 
the first of its kind the estimate is based on the 165000 paid 
for henry millers tropic of cancer at sothebys in 1986 the 
auction record for a published literary work 
bellow who won the nobel prize for literature in 1976 said in 
todays new york times that he is selling the material because he 
has no sentimental attachments to the manuscripts 
with the money he said he might endow a chair at a university 
for a writer 
the novel is about arthur sammler a polish jew in his 70s who 
survived the holocaust and lives in manhattan in the 1960s the 
material is on loan to the regenstein library of the university of 
chicago where bellow is a professor of english and social thought 
bellow has donated the draft material of other books to the 
library and the library had hoped to keep the sammler work 
librarians and manuscript curators discussing the sale echoed 
the concerns of lola szladits curator of the berg collection of 
the new york public library who worries that a purchase by an 
investor will cut scholars access to the archive 
for him bellow its over but its not over for the reader 
and the literary critic and it is not over in the flow of literary 
history ms szladits said the written traces of great 
creative minds will just disappear if their manuscripts do

united methodists who have condoned abortion 
in some tragic conflicts of life voted to oppose it as a means 
of birth control or because the expected baby isnt of the desired 
sex 
we cannot affirm abortion as an acceptable means of birth 
control and we unconditionally reject it as a means of gender 
selection says the amendment approved wednesday night by the 
denominations governing conference 
the 96millionmember denomination is the countrys second 
largest protestant group next to the southern baptist convention 
which sweepingly condemns abortion except to save the life of the 
mother 
several other protestant bodies in recent years have taken a 
sterner position about abortion modifying prochoice stands while 
others have turned completely against it 
the conference here acted after it defeated a broader 
condemnation of abortion that said unborn human life is a human 
being and therefore has a right to be born loved and cared for 
supporting that position eve g kirk of hinckley ill told 
the nearly 1000 delegates that if god is for the poor weak and 
helpess to take a human life in the womb is wrong 
she cited biblical passages saying god knows people before they 
come from the womb adding that those words are for the millions 
of unborn human babies that will never see the planet earth 
however the rev tex a sample a kansas city theologian 
opposed the proposal declaring if this view is carried it will 
take away from parents and children the right to safe medical 
abortion 
the proposal offered by a minority of a legislative committee 
lost by 649 to 308 while the majority proposal tightening 
limitations on abortion in some cases passed overwhelmingly 805 to 
130 
the rev edmond w robb of marshall texas said the approved 
statement was the strongest position the church has ever taken 
about abortion a more responsible position 
robb said the methodist rejection of abortions for birth control 
or convenience puts the church against about 90 percent of 
abortions carried out for those reasons in america 
the new reservations were added to the churchs past postion 
which said 
our belief in the sanctity of unborn human life makes us 
reluctant to approve abortion but we are equally bound to respect 
the sacredness of the life and wellbeing of the mother for whom 
devastating damage may result from unacceptable pregnancy 
in continuity with past christian teaching we recognize 
tragic conflicts of life with life that may justify abortion and 
in such cases support the legal option of abortion under proper 
medical procedures 
in another action the conference voiced opposition to the 
movement for a constitutional amendment making english the 
countrys official language 
opposing it methodist delegates declared these efforts and 
their implications are another manifestation of the systemic racism 
which has infected this country for generations

regime which massacred hundreds of thousands of people with 
soviet military aid the vietnamese have been fighting 50000 or 
more cambodian resistance guerrillas armed by china and politically 
backed by the united states 
we believe that hanoi did withdraw about 15000 troops from 
cambodia last november and that there would be about 125000 there 
right now said ross petzing spokesman for the us embassy in 
bangkok 
we dont have any evidence that fresh troops have replaced the 
personnel that departed but vietnam is able to very quickly return 
troops to cambodia if it so desires he said he quoted 
information the state department sent to us embassies in asia on 
april 28 
vietnam withdrew what it said were 20000 troops last november 
in the largest of six annual withdrawals made since 1982 most if 
not all of the previous pullouts were dismissed by the united 
states and other countries as mere troop rotations 
the us government estimate of vietnamese troop strength in 
cambodia is widely used by news organizations western diplomats 
and others the noncommunist nations of southeast asia generally 
give higher estimates 
the figure of 140000 had been the official estimate since 1986 
in an interview with the associated press early last month 
vietnams foreign minister nguyen co thach said hanoi had over the 
past six years withdrawn half of the forces it had stationed in 
cambodia hanoi will withdraw the remaining half over the next 
three years to keep its pledge of a total pullout by 1990 thach 
said without giving any figures 
petzing also quoted the state department as saying it had seen 
reports indicating vietnam has withdrawn some of its troops 
stationed in laos he said the department had no firm figures 
however 
western diplomats in hanoi also have cited such reports some 
said they believed it was part of vietnams effort to streamline 
its military in order to devote resources to economic development 
vietnams communists helped the laotian communists come to power 
in 1975 and since has maintained a special relationship with 
that country including the stationing of what some estimates have 
put at 40000 or more soldiers

a radio enthusiast who faked a plane crash 
was convicted in federal court of making a false report to the 
government after a neighbor testified he heard the man say i am 
in trouble i am losing blood 
the fake jan 8 report during the height of a snowstorm 
triggered a search for a downed plane three dead passengers and a 
weakening pilot the hunt involved 20 aircraft six police agencies 
and up to 100 people at a cost of 50000 
jurors deliberated for about two hours wednesday before 
convicting mark blair 29 blair faces a fine and up to five years 
in prison when he is sentenced july 1 by us district judge shane 
devine 
in closing arguments assistant us attorney peter papps 
portrayed blair as a radio enthusiast who enjoyed instigating the 
crash hoax during one of the worst storms of the year 
imagine the power he felt making this navy plane run east to 
west and north to south papps said referring to a plane that 
for nearly four hours flew low over risky terrain searching for the 
downed jet 
defense lawyer paul twomey said he will appeal the verdict on 
grounds of insufficient evidence saying this case is garbage 
absolute garbage 
but papps said the testimony of the neighbor and the navy pilot 
clearly identified mark blair as guilty 
blair had testified he couldnt have committed the hoax because 
he was asleep and wasnt aware that a plane was reported down until 
he woke and turned on a police scanner after 1047 pm 
blair said he then overheard the downed pilot tell the navy 
plane that he believed passengers were dead that he had lost a lot 
of blood was having trouble staying conscious and could see and 
hear the navy plane overhead 
but his account conflicted with times given monday by david 
webster the navy reservist and delta airlines pilot flying the 
navy plane he said conversations with the lost plane ended shortly 
after 1035 pm 
timothy dinan 24 who lived in blairs apartment building said 
he heard the scratchy sound of a twoway radio through an open 
window in blairs apartment and a voice clearly saying i am in 
trouble i am losing blood 
when police searched blairs apartment and a nearby storage 
shed they seized radio equipment and printed material that 
included the name dale the name given to searchers by the man who 
said he was the injured pilot 
the materials also contained highlighted references to a radio 
frequency used that night and information about police emergency 
codes

cuba will withdraw its troops from angola under a 
fouryear timetable if south africa ends its occupation of 
southwest africa a cuban official said today 
jorge risquet valdes cubas delegate in angolan peace talks 
outlined his countrys terms for withdrawing from angola at a news 
conference 
angola cuba south africa and the united states concluded a 
twoday conference wednesday aimed at ending the angolan civil war 
cuban troops were sent into angola in 1975 to defend the marxist 
government against prowestern rebels of the national union for the 
total independence of angola the united states aids the rebel 
group 
south africa troops also are in southern angola to back the 
rebel movement and to attack angolan bases of the southwest 
african peoples organization which is fighting for independence 
of the south africanheld territory of southwest africa or 
namibia 
risquet said havana would withdraw its troops from angola under 
a fouryear timetable hinging on south african readiness to give 
independence to namibia 
he also said south africa and the rebels must cease attacks on 
angolan soil 
a joint statement wednesday at the end of the talks said 
progress was made and the parties agreed to meet again in a few 
weeks at a still undecided african location 
our optimism could be defined as moderate risquet said

noninterference in the internal affairs of angola and assurances 
that angola is not going to be attacked again 
cuban forces in angola which he said numbered aver 35000 
would remain as long as angola needs us 
but if the abovementioned conditions are met then cubas role 
will have been fulfilled risquet said 
he declined to disclose cubas casualties in the 12 years it has 
had forces there but said the economic cost to havana had been 
heavy 
he also called for an end to us aid to angolan rebels chester 
crocker us assistant secretary of state for african affairs who

the nations 107 immigration offices closed their doors today to 
a onceinalifetime offer of amnesty for millions of illegal 
immigrants after processing tens of thousands on the final day of 
the yearlong program 
aliens who beat the deadline today exchanged hugs and kisses and 
waved american flags in los angeles immigration and naturalization 
service employees in houston popped open champagne bottles as the 
final applicants walked out the door in chicago workers waved a 
flag and burst a balloon at midnight 
thank god this is a blessing we have come so far and from so 
much suffering said rosa pineda a guatemalan who applied in 
albuquerque nm 
in honolulu commercial fisherman sione feiloakitau partied with 
native dancers and immigration officials today after becoming the 
last person in the united states to apply before the deadline 
no words can express my appreciation and my happiness at this 
time said feiloakitau 42 who moved to hawaii in 1979 from the 
south pacific nation of tonga this is something i have hoped for 
for a long time 
as they say better late than never said mark everson an 
ins deputy commissioner from washington who presented feiloakitau 
with a tiny statue of liberty replica 
as of tuesday 14 million people filed applications nationwide 
and 475000 people were seeking legal status under a separate 
program for seasonal agricultural workers the ins said the 
deadline for that program is nov 30 there were no figures 
available yet for wednesday 
at this time it appears we will break 2 million for the 
combined programs ins spokesman greg leo said in washington dc 
most of the applications were received in the west where 13 
million people have applied for amnesty under the two federal 
programs the western region is comprised of california nevada 
arizona hawaii and guam 
illegal aliens who have lived in the united states continuously 
since before jan 1 1982 were eligible for temporary residency 
and amnesty from deportation under the program they must apply for 
permanent residency with 18 months and can eventually apply for 
citizenship 
rogelio curriel 23 of jalisco mexico was among the last of 
the more than 68000 people to apply in los angeles on wednesday 
asked why he waited so long curriel said i dont know but i 
did 
the doors closed at the office in hialeah fla at 1202 am

sandra were allowed in 
we were home we saw the news i told him lets go for it 
said mrs pico out of breath 
the couple ran red lights to get to the office on time said 
mrs pico who is a us citizen 
more than 3000 applied for amnesty on wednesday bringing 
floridas total number to 114838 said richard smith regional ins 
deputy director 
ins employees cheered as rosa lopez walked into the houston 
center at midnight 
ms lopez 62 said she didnt file her application sooner 
because she didnt have enough money she still only had 40 in 
cash when she presented her application but the ins granted her a 
60day extension to pay the remaining 145 
im very happy she said 
in new york applicants were allowed to enter the ins office up

carmen siguenza 28 of ecuador was not so lucky she was in a 
bewildered group of six who were turned away shortly after midnight 
at an ins office in chicago where 9299 illegal aliens registered 
on wednesday 
now she said she might have to return to ecuador where her 
husband and two sons still live 
im scared i cant work she said 
but the guard at the office door told the group sorry youre 
too late you had a whole year 
an exception to the amnesty deadline was mandated in new york 
state wednesday by the 2nd us circuit court of appeals which 
extended it for some aliens until at least may 16 because of 
initial confusion about the programs application to parents of 
usborn children on welfare they were first ruled ineligible 
then eligible for amnesty and the state has been seeking a 60day 
extension 
a federal judge in sacramento calif scheduled a hearing for 
today on whether the deadline also should be extended through 
november for illegal aliens who did not apply because they had made 
brief trips outside the country without permission from immigration 
officials us district judge lawrence k karlton ruled tuesday 
that the ins wrongly made such trips grounds for disqualification 
in washington dc us district judge stanley sporkin gave 
certain nonimmigrant aliens such as foreign students who violated 
terms of their visas by working until aug 31 to show the court 
they were dissuaded from applying because of an ins 
misinterpretation 
but some who processed the aliens offered no hope for an 
extension beyond midnight wednesday 
theyve been hanging from the rafters the past few days 
said hazel leitch of catholic charities in tulsa okla 
after midnight thats it they cant come in here and say i 
had a flat tire the line has to be drawn somewhere

the soviet government regrets the labor unrest in 
poland but denies it has any relevance to soviet economic reforms 
a foreign ministry spokesman said today 
soviet media were silent about the crackdown by polish 
authorities on strikers at a steel mill outside krakow and a 
lockout of workers at a gdansk shipyard 
official radio moscow reported only that 61 percent of the 
people polled in the soviet unions western neighbor thought the 
strikes would damage the economy 
asked at a regular news briefing about the labor unrest foreign 
ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said we regret that such 
events take place in poland 
he declined to say whether soviet officials had offered advice 
or suggestions to the polish government 
asked whether the labor unrest sparked by price increases 
imposed by the government was a warning for soviet officials who 
say prices must go up to reform the soviet economy he said 
we closely follow the events in poland they go their way and 
we go ours i dont see any definite links we have our own 
problems here 
but gerasimov noted that among the economic reforms being 
discussed in the official soviet press are price increases and 
consumer demand that cannot be met because of a lack of goods 
soviet officials say prices will go up in the early 1990s to cut 
the billions of rubles the government spends every year on 
subsidies for food and other basic items 
that has caused an outcry among consumers and the communist 
party newspaper pravda has said it receives more letters about the 
pending price increases than almost any other topic 
polish workers are seeking pay increases of up to 60 percent to 
offset prices that have gone up 42 percent so far this year the 
polish government has said the price increases are necessary to 
straighten out polands economic problems and that the strikes 
damage the reform effort 
pravda on wednesday accused antipolish centers in the west 
and domestic dissidents of trying to exploit the unrest in poland

what the killer rabbit was for jimmy carter 
and the bump on the head was for gerald ford the signs of the 
zodiac may become for ronald reagan 
americans love to make fun of the occupants of the white house 
and the president and first lady nancy reagan have just given them 
an excuse 
actually not much of an excuse is needed almost anything will 
do 
lyndon johnson was subjected to endless jokes just for pulling 
up his shirt and showing his scar from gall bladder surgery 
abraham lincoln was a figure of fun because of his habit of telling 
tall stories even richard nixon not much of a standup comic 
drew guffaws for dressing up white house guards in goofy uniforms 
once in a while though something happens that strikes the 
public funny bone with special impact 
for carter it all started on a spring afternoon in 1979 when he 
told some of his aides gathered on the truman balcony of the white 
house about his encounter with a swamp rabbit as he fished in a 
pond on his farm in georgia 
carter said the animal was hissing and gnashing its teeth and 
seemed intent on climbing into his boat the commander in chief 
said he took action by splashing water at the rabbit with his 
paddle to shoo it away 
carters press secretary jody powell who was in the group on 
the balcony later wrote had i been doing my job i would have 
stopped the president at that moment pointed out the dangers to 
him and his administration if such a story ever got out and sworn 
him and all within reach of his voice to secrecy 
instead powell told the story several months later to a 
reporter brooks jackson of the associated press jackson wrote a 
lighthearted column about it and the fat was in the fire 
it was a nightmare said powell the story ran for more 
than a week the president was repeatedly asked to explain his 
behavior at town hall meetings press conferences and meetings 
with editors 
the former press secretary had his own tongue in cheek when he 
wrote that account but it is certainly true that the enraged 
rabbit added a new facet to the folklore of the president from 
plains 
ford inadvertently broke into comedy one rainy day in salzburg 
austria as he walked down the steps of air force one on arrival 
for an international meeting with one arm around his wife and the 
other holding an umbrella 
two or three steps from the bottom of the ramp by his count 
his heel caught on something with no arm free to grab a rail he 
tumbled onto the tarmac then jumped to his feet unhurt 
from that moment on every time i stumbled or bumped my head 
or fell in the snow reporters zeroed in on that to the exclusion 
of almost everything else ford complained in his white house 
memoirs 
not only that but johnny carson made jokes about the subject on 
his late night television show and comic chevy chase practically 
made a career out of mimicking fords supposed clumsiness 
their antics and ill admit i laughed at them myself 
helped create the public perception of me as a stumbler and that 
wasnt funny said ford 
now comes former white house chief of staff donald t regan 
reportedly saying in a forthcoming book that mrs reagan used 
astrology to determine the timing of presidential speeches and 
travel the report reminded people that the president also has 
professed interest in astrology 
both carter and ford had elections coming up when the snickers 
about the rabbit and the stumbles began both lost 
reagan doesnt have that to worry about he isnt running 
but vice president george bush is running and he lost no time 
joining in the fun 
aboard air force ii as he began a threeday presidential 
campaign swing through the west on tuesday bush was asked about 
joyce jillson a los angeles astrologer who says the stars told her 
bush would be reagans best running mate in 1980 
ill likely work closely with her bush said shes 
brilliant joyce jillson secretary of what

surgeon general c everett koop today defended 
the mailing of a sexually explicit pamphlet on aids to every 
american home saying the brochure is designed to prevent the 
greatest threat in the way of an epidemic weve ever had 
but the head of an antiabortion group called it a 
disreputable intrusion into family life 
koop appearing on nbctvs today show said when you 
send sexually explicit information into the homes of this country 
in order to prevent the greatest threat in the way of an epidemic 
weve ever had i think that that is defendable 
in another interview on cbs this morning koop declared 
my position in this goverment is that of surgeon general im not 
the chaplain to the conservatives and i have to be the surgeon 
general to all of the people of this country and if theres a 
health message it has to be delivered 
the eightpage pamphlet being mailed in sealed envelopes 
includes a description of the role of condoms in helping to prevent 
the spread of the fatal virus 
judy brown president of the american life league called the 
brochure a disreputable intrusion into family life 
also interviewed on nbc she said the pamphlet left out key 
scientific evidence that would discourage promiscuity she accused 
koop of suggesting that its all right to have sex with an 
unmarried partner if hes willing to discuss his former sex 
habits with you 
what this brochure does is degrade if you will sexuality to 
nothing more than a mechanical act that people are subconsciously 
going to be involved in that they cannot practice selfcontrol 
she said 
the american life league which describes itself as a national 
christian organization with 300000 members opposed president 
reagans nomination of supreme court justice anthony m kennedy and 
has called for the roman catholic church to excommunicate its 
members who support abortion rights 
koop and health and human services secretary otis r bowen began 
a series of appearances to draw attention to the massive mailing 
aimed at informing every us household about the dangers of 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome which has killed nearly 33000 
americans 
koop told nbc there is tremendous misinformation abroad in 
this land this will set the record straight it tells you how 
you will not get aids but tells you very explicitly how you can get 
the virus 
koop said his brochure was approved without changes by the white 
house although he did not know whether president reagan had 
personally gone over it 
koop was asked on cbstvs this morning about conservatives 
who do not like the publication 
this went to the white house it was seen by the domestic 
policy council it was seen by the chief of staff it was also 
tested on 80 different focus groups and 288 organizations with an 
interest in aids had a part in this preparation he said 
it is still a good idea because we will be able to get 
material into homes where famliies can discuss it and add their own 
moral religious ethical values and not be afraid their youngsters 
are going to learn things theyd rather not have them hear said 
koop 
bowen told a news conference wednesday the 17 million project 
is the first time the federal government has attempted to contact 
virtually every resident directly by mail regarding a public 
health crisis 
koops photograph appears on the cover along with a brief 
message over his signature 
some of the issues involved in this brochure may not be things 
you are used to discussing openly the surgeon general wrote i 
can easily understand that but now you must discuss them we all 
must know about aids read this brochure and talk about it with 
those you love 
bowen said koop was given the highprofile role in the project 
because americans know and have faith in the health advisories of 
the surgeon general and that trust will help ensure the success of 
this effort 
there were a few complaints that such a mailer should have gone 
out a year earlier but the slick and explicit booklet drew 
widespread praise for its contents 
this pamphlet should be required reading for every american 
citizen the american hospital association said in a statement 
everyone who reads this mailer will understand the disease 
better and i hope this understanding will lead to urgency and 
compassion and replace panic and fear said rep henry waxman 
dcalif who blamed unnamed white house censors for blocking 
such a project last year 
rep william dannemeyer rcalif criticized the mailing 
you get the impression that none of us have anything to fear 
from associating with people who have the virus arc aidsrelated 
complex or aids said dannemeyer whose district is next to 
waxmans nothing could be further from the truth the report 
should not go out to the american people 
the first batch of brochures is to be picked up by the us 
postal service in three days in preparation for deliveries starting 
may 26 posters have been distributed advertising you asked for 
answers about aids theyre in the mail 
the second page of the brochure bears the heading how do you 
get aids from sex and goes on to say it can enter the body 
through the vagina penis rectum or mouth 
anal intercourse with or without a condom is risky it 
continues the rectum is easily injured during anal intercourse 
the fourth page contains a headline asking what is all the 
talk about condoms 
for those who are sexually active and not limiting their 
sexual activity to one partner condoms have been shown to help 
prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases that is why 
the use of condoms is recommended to help reduce the spread of 
aids

a man impaled by 22 inches of a tree limb 
that penetrated his abdomen in a logging accident is out of 
intensive care today and says he considers himself very lucky to be 
alive 
gary crawford 31 of hazlehurst was listed in fair condition 
at a savannah hospital 
i remember everything crawford said i remember asking 
the lord to help me to get the stick out of me 
crawford was operating a skidder a heavy tractor used to haul 
logs near stilson on april 29 when a tree limb penetrated the 
heavy cage that protects the drivers seat from falling limbs 
candler county sheriff homer bell said crawford was driving over 
cutdown trees and a branch on one of those trees struck him 
crawfords mother colleen crawford said the branch entered her 
sons body in the groin area and bypassed his liver kidneys and 
bowels to press against the skin of his back 
it the limb didnt break the skin in his back she said 
but 22 inches of the stick were inside my sons body 
he underwent several hours of surgery at memorial medical center 
in savannah to remove the limb and was in an intensive care unit 
for almost five days 
crawford said he suffered only nerve damage i consider myself 
pretty lucky he said i dont know if i will be able to walk 
but i am not paralyzed i just cant s myth that pressers and williams 
elections had 
been engineered and manipulated by organized crime elements 
the fbi and the department of justice know that at this time 
no such influence exists said john r climaco the unions 
general counsel its a fiction pure fiction 
climaco said presser and other top union officials feel 
vindicated and are comforted by the fact that after over one 
year of testimony this jury was able to accurately ferret out the 
truth 
despite the setback in the salerno case some teamster 
officials speaking on the condition of anonymity said they still 
fear that rudolph giuliani the us attorney for manhattan will 
pursue a civil takeover attempt 
they have been extremely adamant and cocky the past 30 days 
about their intention to file this thing one union official 
said even this might not deter them 
the justice department used a similar suit under the rico law in 
1986 to place the 8000member teamsters local 560 in union city 
nj under the control of a courtappointed trustee 
the local one of the largest in the union had been under the 
control of convicted and now imprisoned mob figure anthony tony 
pro provenzano who has been liked to the stillunsolved 1975 
disappearance of former teamsters president jimmy hoffa 
however the governments takeover of local 560 lacked the 
political ramifications of its contemplated attempt to place an 
entire international union under the control of a courtappointed 
trustee 
when word of the anticipated suit was leaked by anonymous 
government sources last august the teamsters went on the 
offensive saying government takeovers of unions are nothing new 
communists have been doing it for years 
the aflcio which had ousted the teamsters on corruption 
charges in 1957 immediately came to their defense likening the 
suit to the soviet unions crushing of the solidarity labor 
movement in poland in 1981 
three months labor the teamsters were welcomed back into the 
aflcio in a move that the federations president lane kirkland 
said would not have happened had it not been for the contemplated 
takeover suit some aflcio leaders admitted the teamsters 
reaffiliation was a defensive move 
government prosecutors had acknowledged that if the suit against 
the teamsters succeeded their next targets were the laborers 
union the hotel and restaurant workers union and the international 
longshoremens association 
all three of those longtime aflcio affiliates along with the 
teamsters were identified in a 1985 report by a white house 
commission on organized crime as being under the control or 
influence of mob figures

the soviet news agency tass today issued a 
blistering comment on president reagans remarks on human rights 
and accused his administration of waging a massive onslaught on 
civil liberties at home 
in a speech wednesday in chicago reagan took an unusually 
moderate tone toward the soviet union and deplored unemployment 
homelessness and racial bigotry in his own country 
the speech was billed as a scenesetter for reagans may 29june 
2 summit meeting in moscow with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
but tass ignored reagans conciliatory remarks about the soviet 
union and focused on the presidents acknowledgement of problems in 
his own country 
reagan had to admit that the situation is unfavorable in the 
area of social and economic rights in the usa tass said 
but the president asserted that these problems belong to an 
essentially different category from civil and political rights 
in a more conciliatory tone soviet foreign ministry spokesman 
gennady i gerasimov told a regular news briefing today that the 
most interesting part of it reagans speech is that the president 
recognized there are problems in the united states 
but he added that reagan had spoken out for solving disputes 
peacefully and said we think thats a good idea for the moscow 
summit 
tass was silent on comments reagan had made about the human 
rights situation in the soviet union the president hailed the 
release of some religious and political activists but said he hoped 
for more improvements 
but the soviet news agency cited us sources and statistics in 
an attempt to debunk reagans claim that no government may 
violate the freedoms of expression and assembly protected by the 
bill of rights 
it is precisely under the current administration that a 
massive onslaught was launched on all these freedoms tass said 
reagan contended americans have the right to free assembly tass 
said but it said it was recently documented that fbi agents in 
198185 conducted active surveillance of more than 180 public 
religious and antiwar organizations who opposed administration 
policy in central america 
under the pretext of combatting terrorism fbi agents were 
present at meetings protographed participants in demonstrations 
eavesdropped on telephone conversations tass said 
those fbi activities were made possible by an executive order 
signed by reagan in 1981 which sanctioned largescale operations 
for the surveillance of americans even if they are not suspected 
of violating the law tass said 
tass quoted a prominent american lawyer floyd abrams as having 
said the reagan administration is apparently hostile to 
constitutional provisions that declare citizens must have access to 
information 
the first amendment to the constitution protects the freedoms of 
the press and speech among others 
over the past seven years tass said 50 percent to 70 percent 
of americans have consistently opposed aid to the nicaraguan contra 
rebels 
but the white house ignored the will of the majority of 
americans even organizing a secret operation that broke us law 
to supply the contras with weapons it said

vice president george bush says he sometimes 
holds back from speaking in white house meetings out of fear of 
leaks and reluctance to have the president choosing between his 
vice president and members of the cabinet 
he said the prospect of kiss and tell books about the reagan 
administration hinders the free exchange of views in the 
governments highest circles 
it inhibits freedom of expression the vehemence with which 
people express their views bush told a group of reporters 
wednesday during a campaign stop in sacramento 
he was referring to a recent book by former white house press 
secretary larry speakes and a forthcoming one by former chief of 
staff donald t regan 
if you think somebody is there writing a book putting his or 
her own spin on it you hold back he said 
i hold back speaking in meetings because i dont want the 
president to have to be choosing between his vice president and the 
other members of the cabinet said bush 
and i hold back sometimes because i worry about leaks 
the vice president planned to visit a high school in east los 
angeles today before flying to idaho as he continued a threeday 
campaign swing through the west 
calling california a major battleground in the fall 
election bush said ill be back ill be back have to got to 
win this state 
he said he would absolutely not rule out california gov 
george deukmejian as a potential running mate 
but he said he has not talked to the republican governor about 
the subject nor to anyone else at this point insisting he wants 
to wait until after the democratic convention in july before 
deciding 
bush made light of reports based on regans new book that 
nancy reagan has sought the help of astrologers in making 
recommendations to her husband on scheduling 
bush said i know it is a fascinating titillating subject for 
all with particular emphasis on the journalistic community 
i may get more interested he joked 
a spokesman stephen hart said the vice president does not 
consult astrologers or horoscopes or anything of the kind he 
doesnt even know where the horoscope is in the newspaper 
but speaking to reporters on air force ii on thursday bush 
said ill tell you one thing there are two edges to this 
sword 
there are a helluva lot of people across this country that 
read these columns otherwise they wouldnt be in the papers 
asked about joyce jillson a los angeles astrologer who contends 
she helped unidentified reagan campaign aides select bush as a 
running mate in 1980 bush said he had never heard of her 
but he joked ill likely work closely with her shes 
brilliant 
in sacramento bush said generally speaking i dont like 
kissandtell books 
bush also said panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega 
should go denying he had signed on to any possible white house 
compromise to enable noriega to step down from power instead 
i want him to leave the country bush said 
bush also reiterated his charge that both democratic 
frontrunner michael dukakis and jesse jackson lack foreign policy 
experience 
when a reporter noted that reagan did not have such experience 
either upon taking office in 1981 bush said maybe this guy 
dukakis could muddle through and make it maybe jackson could 
too 
well never know whether president reagan could have done an 
even better job if he had foreign policy experience he said he 
quickly added that reagans performance in foreign policy had been 
splendid

israeli troops seized 20 guerrillas and 
brought them back to israel after a twoday raid into southern 
lebanon that left at least 40 arabs dead sources said today 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said israel would not hestitate 
to make raids similiar to the strike that began monday into the 
area of southern lebanon that israel has designated its security 
zone 
three israeli soldiers were killed during the operation 
the point was to purge the security zone rabin told israel 
radio there is nothing worse than allowing terror elements who 
are active against us to establish themselves freely and feel free 
to act against israeli and targets in the security zone 
he said the proiranian hezbollah or party of god shiite 
moslem movement was singled out by the israeli forces this time 
because it has become one of the elements that most cooperates 
with palestine liberation organization chief yasser arafat 
the israelis confronted hezbollah guerrillas wednesday in the 
village of maydoun north of the security zone in the fiercest 
fighting of the operation 
reports from lebanon said israeli troops abandoned maydoun after 
blowing up houses and using bulldozers to cover up the rubble and 
the bodies of the guerrillas army officials denied the village was 
destroyed 
maydoun was not destroyed what was destroyed were the 
trenches the bunkers col raanan gissin deputy army spokesman 
told reporters in tel aviv 
israeli sources speaking on condition of anonymity said that 
israelibacked troops of the south lebanon army militia entered 
maydoun after the israeli withdrawal to conduct a cleaning up 
mission 
israel radio reported that the militiamen left maydoun after 
conducting searches and blowing up houses in the village army 
officials confirmed that the militiamen returned to the security 
zone 
military officials said a south lebanon army tank opened fire on 
a guerrilla vehicle approaching maydoun today and killed the 
guerrillas inside they did not elaborate 
the israeli sources also said today that israeli troops arrested 
20 guerrillas during the operation and brought them back to israel 
critics questioned the wisdom of attacking hezbollah noting 
that its guerrillas had not participated in any of the dozen 
infiltration attempts by palestinian guerrillas into israel since 
november 
why hezbollah asked military analyst uzi mahanaimi in a 
front page commentary in the yediot ahronot daily 
hezbollah is not the israeli armys main enemy in south 
lebanon and has not tried to penetrate into northern israel since 
1982 mahanaimi wrote 
on wednesday helmeted soldiers riding armored personnel 
carriers waved and made the vforvictory sign as they crossed 
back into israel 
the mission was intended to clear the area from terrorist 
strongholds serve a warning signal to the local population and 
enhance our deterrence against terrorist activity gissin 
said 
but some experts said the mission could backfire and lead to 
more guerrilla strikes against israel 
it was israels largest military operation in south lebanon in 
two years security sources said up to 2500 israeli troops took 
part 
soldiers searched five villages in southeastern lebanon on 
tuesday and wednesday and distributed leaflets telling residents 
not to assist guerrillas 
gissin said shiite moslem militiamen of hezbollah drove 
villagers out of maydoun last year and took over the community he 
described maydoun as a hezbollah stronghold fortified with 
trenches dugouts and gun emplacements 
army officials said maydoun threatened outposts of the 
israelibacked south lebanon army militia and civilians living in 
the christiandominated security zone a six to 10milewide strip 
north of israels border 
reporters covering the attack said there were 6070 guerrillas 
in maydoun 
israeli paratroopers surrounded the village on tuesday night 
and led by a dozen tanks moved into maydoun at dawn troops met 
fierce opposition as they advanced slowly while fighting in 
trenches and in housetohouse battles 
one soldier died in the fighting and two others were killed when 
hezbollah and lebanese army gunners shelled the assault force from 
nearby mashghara site of a 50man syrian garrison 
israeli troops fired on mashghara and israel radio quoted 
lebanese reports as saying five lebanese army gunners were wounded 
the israeli army said its attack helicopters and artillery struck 
at and destroyed lebanese army guns gissin denied lebanese 
reports that the syrian garrison was hit 
we took precautions that our artillery fire or even flat 
trajectory fire would not be directed against the syrians gissin 
said the results prove we succeeded the syrians did not make an 
offensive move

saudi arabia today rejected irans 
claim that it arrested a saudi spy and told tehran not to pursue 
misleading and venomous campaigns against the kingdom 
iran also claimed wednesday that the saudis beat up iranian 
diplomats before they left saudi arabia after riyadhs decision to 
severe relations with tehran april 26 
riyadh rejected the claims as totally baseless 
it is not difficult for the government of iran with its 
stigma of lying to hire a mercenary from among its followers to do 
and say what he is ordered a saudi government official said in a 
statement distributed by the saudi press agency 
we warn the rulers of tehran against exceeding the limits in 
this manner which is spurned by all sons of the islamic nation 
he said we have decided to confront this misleading and venomous 
campaign with all firmness and determination 
the official islamic republic news agency said wednesday 
security authorities arrested an agent of the riyadh regime who 
had entered the country illegally with 300 million rials 45 
million 
he will be dealt with as a spy the statement said 
convicted spies may be sentenced to death under irans islamic law 
irna also quoted an unidentified information ministry official 
as saying the man was planning to spread wahabi faith and the 
american brand of islam 
the wahabis are an ultraconservative sunni moslem movement 
most saudis including saudi arabias ruling family are wahabis 
the majority of iranians are shiite moslems 
irna earlier quoted iranian officials as saying the saudi 
authorities had dealt barbarically with iranian diplomats in 
their embassy in riyadh and consulate in the red sea port city of 
jidda tuesday 
that was the deadline for them to leave following the april 26 
rupture of ties 
saudi television today screened a 15minute film report showed 
75 iranian diplomats and their dependents at riyadh and jidda 
airports as they left calmly with saudi officials offering them 
coffee and refreshments in the vip lounges 
an iranian boeing 707 was allowed to pick them up 
saudiiranian relations have deteriorated sharply over the past 
year amid iranian charges that the saudis are aiding iraq in its 
war against iran 
the iranians have attacked saudi ships and vessels trading with 
the kingdom in retaliation for iraqi air strikes on their tankers 
in the gulf 
relations between the two countries plummeted after 
iranianinspired riots in the holy city of mecca during the annual 
moslem pilgrimage last july 31 
more than 400 moslem pilgrims including 275 iranians were 
killed in the violence 
the iranians accused saudi security forces of massacring the 
iranians an iranian mob later stormed the saudi embassy in tehran 
and fatally injured a saudi diplomat 
iran also has called for the overthrow of the saudi royal family 
and stripping it of custody of islams holy shrines in mecca and 
medina

the fourth student suicide in six months 
at the massachusetts institute of technology has spurred debate 
about the rigors of attending one of the worlds top technological 
schools 
since the death of mark kordos 18 who jumped from his 13th 
floor dormitory room april 8 students and faculty have questioned 
whether mit drives its already topflight students too hard 
kordos a junior from morristown nj was an excellent student 
majoring in computer science who apparently had no academic or 
personal problems family and friends said he was applying to the 
best graduate schools in the country 
but he left a note saying he considered himself a failure and 
friends said he was having trouble with some of his course work 
andrew fish editorinchief of the campus newspaper the tech 
blamed unwarranted pressures on students insensitive and 
overachieving faculty members and a climate that creates loneliness 
and depression 
the compulsion to constantly work often at the exclusion of 
all other activities can warp the minds and bodies of students 
sometimes with tragic results fish wrote in a column 
kordos was the sixth mit student to kill himself since 1986 all 
were young men and there is no evidence that any had known one 
another 
administrators at mit which has about 9600 students said the 
overall rate of suicide at the school is no higher than the 
national average of approximately 14 suicides per 10000 
collegeage students a year 
before the recent deaths suicides were rare at mit officials 
said there were none in 1985 one in 1984 two in 1983 and none 
from 197982 
the suicide rate of americans under 25 has tripled in the last 
30 years and suicide is now the secondleading cause of death of 
college students 
there is no evidence ive been able to come across that 
matters at mit are out of line with what is happening with youth 
throughout the country mit provost john deutch told the boston 
globe 
six members of mits faculty are nobel laureates and 14 have 
received the national medal of science because mit draws students 
who are in the top 5 percent of their high school classes it is a 
place where the best and brightest quickly can become average or 
below average 
ron kordos marks father said mit was absolutely a factor 
in his sons death 
he was a superachiever he never earned a b in his life 
kordos said but the issue was pressure the sleep deprivation 
and competition were so excessive he was just being driven by the 
system

justice department officials say theres 
nothing amiss in attorney general edwin meeses solicitation of 
lawyers and businessmen to pay 3240 to attend a conference put on 
by the group that paid his wifes expenses to a similar forum in 
china last year 
justices chief spokesman terry eastland dismissed a series of 
questions which have arisen since meeses solicitation letter on 
behalf of the groups conference in japan was disclosed in news 
accounts tuesday 
the private conference on usjapanese legal and economic 
issues is set for aug 29sept 1 and meese is to head a us 
delegation as part of an official visit he is making to japan at 
the same time 
the solicitation by meese is under investigation by the office 
of government ethics which is independent of the justice 
department and polices a presidential order barring conflicts of 
interest or actions which create an appearance of a conflict or of 
favoritism 
eastland said at a news conference wednesday that assistant 
attorney general charles j cooper head of the departments office 
of legal counsel had reviewed the news accounts earlier in the day 
and determined that meeses action does meet applicable legal and 
ethical standards 
eastland nevertheless acknowledged that department officials 
did not know when they approved the meese letter that a 
profitmaking organization the citizen ambassador program of 
spokane wash was recruiting conference participants and paying 
100 per traveler to its nonprofit affiliate people to people 
international of kansas city 
he added that although meese wrote his letter on plain 
stationery a department official joseph morris authorized people 
to people to reproduce the attorney generals official letterhead 
and justice department seal and assemble them atop the 30000 
copies of the meese letter sent april 26 to lawyers and businessmen 
unauthorized use of the department seal is a federal crime 
eastland said that at the invitation of people to people meese 
had attended a similar international legal conference in china last 
year and had sent a similar but smaller batch of solicitation 
letters then 
he said the group had paid the expense of meeses wife ursula 
on that trip and produced a letter showing that it also paid the 
expenses of morris wife deborah eastland said department 
regulations allow private reimbursement of spousal trip expenses 
under certain circumstances which were met in this case 
in a july 16 1987 letter to morris tom stillitano jr of 
people to people confirmed the group would pay the china expenses 
of mrs meese and mrs morris because their participation would 
help emphasize the human side of this type of program showing 
that while we are a nation of law the essence of mutual 
understanding is truly relating to each other on a people to people 
level 
eastland said because conferences of this kind clearly serve 
the interests of the department and the us government and 
because they benefit the american people the attorney generals 
role in this matter is entirely appropriate 
cooper ruled that its a question of whether its in the 
departments interest not whether a profitmaking group is 
involved eastland said 
meeses letter was sent to people whose names were provided by 
everyone from the american bar association the advisory committees 
on both sides to the american chamber of commerce in japan said 
norm swanson chairman of the citizen ambassador program 
eastland released an exchange of letters between meese and his 
japanese counterpart justice minister yukio hayashida 
on march 15 hayashida invited meese to make an official visit 
to japan to coincide with the conference twenty days later meese 
accepted the invitation and said he understood the two of them 
would be invited to cochair the conference called the usjapan 
bilateral session a new era in legal and economic relations 
people to people international is a nonprofit organization set 
up originally in the state department by thenpresident dwight 
eisenhower swanson said 
the citizen ambassador program however is a profitmaking 
organization that works exclusively to set up international 
exchanges for people to people swanson said

jesse jackson said today he will appeal 
for fairness to every super delegate and member of the 
democratic national committee and try to convince those party 
leaders that their support should correspond to the popular vote in 
the primaries and caucuses 
after spending the night with a farm family in this rural 
nebraska hamlet jackson told reporters that frontrunner michael 
dukakis lead in delegates is an inflated padded lead created 
by super delegates committed to dukakis 
super delegates are party leaders or elected public officials 
the democratic party designates 643 super delegates who have a 
large voice at the national convention 
of those 643 dukakis has the commitment of 166 thus far 
jackson 46 and the remainder are uncommitted overall dukakis 
holds a delegate lead of almost 600 over jackson 
jackson who in the last two days has begun outspoken criticism 
of the super delegate system said it gives voters the impression 
that their vote does not count 
asked if he intended to hold back his support for the partys 
ticket if the delegate count did not directly correspond to the 
popular vote jackson said thats immature why should we 
proceed in that atmosphere lets be reasonable rational and 
consistent 
talking to a small group of reporters at the farmhouse of peace 
activists maxine and fred schroeder jackson took a jab at dukakis 
gubernatorial problems in massachusetts he said there is a 77 
million shortfall in the state budget and added we cannot run 
our country on statebystate miracles 
he accused dukakis of cutting money for pregnant teenagers and 
senior citizens some of our most vulnerable people have to bear 
the burden of the cuts he said 
dukakis has maintained that no existing services will be cut to 
balance the massachusetts state budget 
jackson spoke to a gymnasium full of students at kearney high 
school before heading to campaign in new mexico and then california 
jackson has not said whether he intends to mount an allout 
challenge to party rules like the one he waged during his 1984 
presidential race 
jackson complained wednesday at a news conference and later in 
an address to the congressional black caucus that the popular vote 
candidates win is not directly tied to the number of delegates they 
receive toward the nomination 
there must be some reasonable correlation between the popular 
vote and the delegate count in a democracy he told the black 
congress members 
were not talking about generosity were talking about 
reciprocity 
and he suggested that he expects such reciprocity as a condition 
of his cooperation with the democratic ticket in the general 
election 
party leaders and the pundits he said are trying to figure out 
how you can get a combination of jackson support a short platform 
and win 
thats not a formula for winning he said 
the mention of the platform apparently was a signal that jackson 
wants more specifics in the party platform than does democratic 
chairman paul kirk who has indicated it should be streamlined 
asked by reporters what he would do about his concerns regarding 
delegates the democratic contender said i can only appeal 
for fairness 
although he has suffered a string of losses to dukakis 
including tuesday in ohio and indiana jackson said he would fight 
on and take the nomination he won the district of columbia which 
offered only a fraction of the delegates of indiana and ohio 
we never before in history had the mathematical chance of 
winning we can win he told the black caucus 
but that would require winning virtually all of the delegates at 
stake in the remaining seven primary states as well as the support 
of the super delegates 
jackson also met with members of the congressional democratic 
caucus in what chairman rep richard gephardt of missouri called a 
warm and successful meeting 
and he held a session with several liberal activists including 
consumer advocate ralph nader and representatives of peace and 
environmental groups

burning it doesnt seem to burn out said jimmy greco riding in 
a medical helicopter 1000 feet over the scene 
the blaze cast an eerie glare across the isthmus between the 
mississippi river and lake pontchartrain 20 miles upriver from new 
orleans thick acrid smoke billowed over the area looking like 
thunderclouds in the red glow 
the force of the blast blew out windows the entire metropolitan

an evacuation center was set up at destrehan high school but 
officials allowed everyone to return home after 9 am except those 
living on the two streets next to the refinery 
it was very very loud one thunder behind the other and it 
shook the house said one of the evacuees adam mashia 65 who 
lives less than a mile from the plant i thought well maybe 
the russians dropped a bomb 
the refinery sits in the middle of the heavily industralized 
corridor along the mississippi between new orleans and baton rouge

from the blast 
wendy jacobs another shell spokeswoman said 92 of the plants

nations no 1 advocate for educational opportunity and good 
schools not just during election years but every day and every 
week and every month

of commitment to excellence and high standards that launched an 
explosion in scientific and economic progress under john kennedy a 
generation ago dukakis said at the university of charleston 
were going to invest in our people wee going to invest in 
new technology were going to invest in research dukakis said

millions in profits while costing jobs

to nebraska to campaign both states have presidential primaries 
tuesday 
in boston meanwhile income tax reports made public today

veteran democratic political operative as his manager for the 
democratic national convention 
the dukakis campaign also has brought in richard moe kirk 
odonnell anne wexler and charles campion as campaign advisers and 
likely will add more veterans of national campaigns in coming weeks

informally advised missouri rep richard gephardts presidential 
campaign odonnell is a former aide to exhouse speaker thomas p 
tip oneil wexler worked for geraldine ferraros 1984 vice

it more advisers are being brought in to help prepare for

federal agents expect theyll have a record 
4ton cocaine seizure once they finish inspecting all 9000 boards 
in a shipmment of hollowedout cocainepacked brazilian lumber 
two colombians and an american meanwhile were in custody on 
drug conspiracy charges awaiting bond hearings friday before a 
federal magistrate 
the haul from the britishregistered amazon sky reached 3500 
kilograms or 7700 pounds by late morning said authorities who 
expect the yield to hit 8800 pounds by the time the inspection is 
finished later today or friday 
if true it would represent the largest cocaine seizure in 
us history us attorney robert merkle said at a news 
conference wednesday 
the largest previous cocaine seizure was 8700 pounds found 
stuffed inside picnic furniture delivered to port everglades in 
november 1987 
an anonymous letter from cali colombia in february tipped drug 
agents that the freighter amazon sky would be docking in florida 
with 4000 kilos of cocaine hidden in lumber authorities said 
us drug enforcement administration agents believe the cocaine 
with an estimated street value of 17 billion was imported by the 
cali cartel 
the cocaine was headed for new york chicago los angeles and 
miami centers of the cali cartels distribution network agents 
said 
the cali group is a worldclass competitor of the medellin 
cartel the violent colombian gang believed responsible for up to 
80 percent of us cocaine imports said tom cash head of the 
miami dea office 
michael tsalickis owner of the amazon sky and a tarpon springs 
warehouse where the cocainefilled lumber was stashed was charged 
with conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine as were fredy 
perez and pedro narvaez authorities said 
tsalickis 60 is an associate of two top cali cartel leaders 
gilberto rodriguez and jose santacruz londono according to dea 
files 
tsalickis a native of tarpon springs who has been written about 
in national geographic magazine has operated numerous businesses 
including a monkey farm and lumber mills in leticia colombia 
the amazon sky loaded 459 bundles of cedar in brazil then 
stopped in leticia colombia where perhaps half of the boards were 
hollowed out stuffed with cocaine in onekilo packets and 
resealed cash said 
the vessel then went down the amazon river and arrived at 
bayboro harbour in st petersburg on april 19 
dea and us customs service inspectors staked out the ship a 
customs inspector later slipped aboard drilled into a lumber 
bundle and found cocaine on his first try cash said 
federal agents set up roundtheclock surveillance obtained 
search warrants and brought in audiovideo and xray equipment 
the whole shipment was unloaded to a warehouse in st 
petersburg a few days later 224 bundles of 24 boards each were 
transported to tsalickis tarpon springs warehouse authorities 
said 
merkle said the cocainefilled lumber was found at the tarpon 
springs site not in the wood left behind in st petersburg

democrat jesse jackson complained today that frontrunner 
michael dukakis has an inflated padded lead in convention 
delegates that does not reflect the popular primary vote vice 
president george bush said he sometimes keeps quiet at cabinet 
meetings to avoid making the president choose sides 
for a second day jackson criticized his partys nominating 
rules he told reporters he will contact every super delegate 
the 643 party leaders and elected officials who have a voice in 
choosing the nominee with appeals for fairness and try to 
persuade them that the super delegate split should correspond to 
the primary and caucus vote 
of those 643 super delegates jackson has 46 dukakis 166 and 
the others remain uncommitted overall in the delegate chase 
dukakis has 1500 of the 2081 needed to clinch the nomination and 
jackson has 927 
despite the numbers jackson continued to insist were within 
striking distance as he campaigned in nebraska which holds its 
primary next week 
but the dukakis people were beginning to talk about being within 
striking distance too of the nomination campaign communications 
director leslie dach said dukakis could clinch it in the remaining 
five weeks worth of primaries a goal that seemed impossible in 
the muddled contest of a few months ago 
the arithmetic is clearly there said dach 
dukakis himself kept to a careful course avoiding any direct 
objections to the criticism jackson has been leveling at him lately 
i dont mind the competition at all as long as we can keep the 
campaign up where it belongs and keep it positive the 
massachusetts governor told reporters in boston 
dukakis headed today for the povertyscarred coal country of 
west virginia which also holds a primary next tuesday and 
criticized bush for his standard campaign line of wanting to be 
the education president 
the next president must be this nations no 1 advocate for 
educational opportunity and good schools not just during election 
years but every day and every week and every month dukakis said 
at home in boston the dukakis campaign released tax returns 
that showed the governor and his wife earned 108957 last year and 
paid 25892 in taxes 
on the republican side bush was campaigning in california 
today as aides talked of the importance of the west in the general 
election 
on wednesday bush said that fear of kiss and tell books has 
sometimes kept him from speaking up in cabinet meetings 
bush said wednesday that other times he keeps quiet at the 
meetings because i dont want the president to have to be 
choosing between his vice president and the other members of the 
cabinet 
since the vice president already has secured enough delegates to 
win the nomination the main suspense concerns his running mate 
bush said wednesday he would absolutely not rule out 
californias governor george deukmejian kansas sen nancy 
kassebaum meanwhile said shes not interested in the job 
bush has sometimes been criticized for not saying more about his 
opinions of reagan administration policies and his role in 
developing them dukakis for one has called him a blank slate 
on wednesday bush offered an explanation for his reticence 
saying it stems from concern about kiss and tell books written 
by former white house insiders 
the vice president cited books like the ones written by exwhite 
house spokesman larry speakes and former chief of staff donald 
regan 
it inhibits freedom of expression the vehemence with which 
people express their views bush told reporters in sacramento 
if you think somebody is there writing a book putting his or her 
own spin on it you hold back i hold back sometimes because i 
worry about leaks 
the vice president made lighthearted reference to one of the 
revelations in the forthcoming regan book that nancy reagan has 
consulted astrologers about the presidents schedule he joked that 
an astrologer claiming to have helped pick him as reagans running 
mate in 1980 might make a good member of his own cabinet 
shes brilliant bush said adding that if anyone was 
interested he and his wife barbara are both geminis 
spokesman stephen hart said bush himself doesnt consult 
astrologers or horoscopes himself but the vice president said 
ill tell you one thing there are a helluva a lot of people 
across this country that read these columns 
dukakis also had a little fun with the reports of astrological 
influence at the white house he joked to a crowd at a new york 
democratic dinner that his horoscope said he was headed for better 
things according to the stars dukakis said it was pointless to 
remain in his present position 
while dukakis studiously avoids saying he expects to be the 
democratic nominee in the past few days he has been recruiting 
some experienced political operatives to work in his likely 
campaign against bush 
he picked marcia hale as his manager for the democratic national 
convention and joining the campaign as advisers are democratic 
veterans richard moe kirk odonnell and anne wexler 
meanwhile democrat paul simon whose presidential campaign is 
on hold said he is 95 percent certain that dukakis will win 
the nomination but simon said hell hang onto his own delegates 
in the unlikely event that michael dukakis stubs his toe between 
now and the convention

the state has joined parents and civil 
liberties groups in opposing a federal judges decision that 
permits a school district to ban two classics criticized as 
promoting sex and womens liberation 
when us district judge susan black ruled for the columbia 
county school board on jan 29 she cited a controversial jan 13 
supreme court ruling that allowed school officials in hazelwood 
mo to censor a school newspaper 
the florida department of education joined the education 
departments of maryland california and wyoming and 14 other groups 
in an appeal of the ruling which upheld a ban on lysistrata 
and the millers tale 
the groups marshaled by people for the american way prepared a 
friendofthecourt brief that was submitted to the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals earlier this week 
syd mckenzie general counsel for the state department of 
education said the department was concerned because it involved 
a stateapproved textbook and for that reason we think judge black 
was overbroad in the authority she granted to the school board 
four parents filed suit against the columbia county school board 
after it banned the two works from high school classrooms 
black in her ruling said she did not like the action taken by 
the columbia county school board in 1986 after receiving complaints 
from a pastor that the works promoted pornography and womens 
lib 
but the judge ruled that the hazelwood decision affirmed the 
broad power of school boards to make curriculum decisions 
jan g levine an attorney for people for the american way a 
270000member organization founded in 1980 by television producter 
norman lear said the case is important because it is one of the 
first to follow the hazelwood ruling 
we hope the ruling is not interpreted so broadly that it 
allows banning of the classics she said 
in the ancient greek comedy lysistrata by aristophanes 
women of warring sparta and athens conspire to deny sex to their 
husbands until the men end their fighting 
in the millers tale written in the 14th century by 
geoffrey chaucer a carpenters wife deceives her husband and a 
wouldbe suitor to cavort with a tenant in her house

the house voted 38523 today to order 
president reagan to use us military might to stop the flow of 
illegal drugs into the united states 
the vote approved a proposal backed by conservative republicans 
to tell reagan to deploy equipment and personnel of the armed 
forces sufficient to halt the unlawful penetration of united states 
borders by aircraft and vessels carrying narcotics 
but the measure is a long way from becoming law even rep jack 
davis rill one of its strongest supporters admitted yes it 
is flawed 
the proposal was added as an amendment to a pentagon budget 
bill the final provisions of the huge bill will be worked out 
later this year by a housesenate conference committee after the 
senate approves its version of the bill 
in two previous years 1985 and 1986 the house also voted to 
use the military to help stop drug trafficking but those 
provisions were knocked out by the conference committee they were 
strongly opposed by the pentagon 
the problem is that our southern borders are just a sieve of 
cocaine and heroin coming over unchallenged every night davis 
told his colleagues we want to bring the front lines into this 
battle against this poison coming across our borders 
rep tommy robinson dark said its time to use the armed 
forces to stop the drug cartel 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee opposed the amendment because he said it should be 
considered as part of a separate package of antidrug legislation 
now being prepared 
we do not want to deal with this problem on a piecemeal 
basis aspin said we have a drug bill coming up in which we 
have to deal with not just the military involvement but all the 
questions about drugs 
but davis and other supporters didnt want to discuss 
technicalities americans arent going to understand what were 
doing here america only wants this amendment to be adopted they 
want the military involved in stopping drug traffic said davis 
todays vote came a day after defense secretary frank c 
carlucci warned that he might recommend a veto of the bill unless 
congress votes enough money for reagans star wars missile defense 
system 
his admonition came as the democraticcontrolled house voted 
223195 to provide 35 billion for the strategic defense 
initiative as star wars is formally known 
that is 13 billion less than reagan sought for the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 and is even below the current 39 billion budget 
for the 5yearold program 
but the decision wednesday is part of the maneuvering in the 
complicated congressional budget process according to rep les 
aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services committee 
the senate next week will begin considering its version of the 
defense budget bill and even though that chamber is also controlled 
by democrats it is more conservative and reagans defense program 
including star wars has generally fared better in the senate 
the senate bill proposes 46 billion for star wars if that 
figure remains the housesenate conference committee called to 
reconcile differences will likely reach a compromise at about 41 
billion aspin said 
well probably split the difference in conference between our 
35 billion we voted today and the senate number and come in 
around 41 billion aspin said after the long series of votes 
the house armed services committee had originally recommended 
41 billion but that was rejected on a 227190 vote earlier a 
312105 decision turned down an amendment to grant reagan his 
entire 49 billion request and a 299118 tally rejected another 
proposal to block all sdi spending 
carlucci in a letter read during the debate said he was 
unhappy with the 41 billion level voted by the committee because 
it would cause major restructuring and delays in the program 
further reductions in funding or other restrictions on the program 
would have the gravest consequences 
carlucci said that if the congress sends the president a 
defense bill that contains a funding level for sdi that is in my 
view inadequate i would have no choice but to recommend a veto of 
that bill 
but his letter didnt define that inadequate level aspin said 
i dont know exactly what it is but i would think that if we do 
come in at 41 billion that would be enough i would hope so 
aspin noted that reagan has threatened in past years to veto 
pentagon budget bills which contain democraticbacked restrictions 
the administration opposes but has yet to carry out that threat 
the house also voted 244174 wednesday to limit spending on 
sdis phase one to 40 percent of the total budget phase 
one is aimed at building an early version of the missile defense 
and current plans called for raising phase one spending from 40 
percent to 50 percent of the sdi program

province announced plans to again publish the novel in addition to 
a sixvolume collection of lawrences works

the soviet unions bolshoi ballet will give its 
first performance in china in 30 years in 1989 soviet minister of 
culture vg zaharov said thursday 
chinas official xinhua news agency quoted zaharov now visiting 
beijing as saying he hoped the visit would strengthen cultural 
ties between china and his country 
almost all political economic and cultural contacts between the 
soviet union and china were suspended after the two communist 
governments split over ideological and strategic matters in 1960 
china still refuses to normalize political ties because of the 
soviet military intervention in afghanistan and soviet support for 
vietnams invasion of cambodia 
however since the early 1980s there has been a gradual increase 
in trade and gradually improving cultural and academic ties 
there were no details on when the visit would take place or 
where the ballet would perform

ipsita roy chakrabarty selfdescribed 
witch and former schoolteacher is accusing officials of failing to 
protect witches in west bengal state where at least 20 suspected 
sorcerers were murdered last year 
the 44yearold housewife went public saturday after chief 
minister jyoti basu the top government official of west bengal 
state disclosed the slayings during a discussion on crime in the 
state 
are we repeating and perpetrating the misdeeds and mistakes of 
medieval europe mrs chakrabarty said why is there nobody to 
call the killing of witches in presentday india brutal and 
superstitious 
basu who heads the communist marxist party in west bengal said 
april 27 that at least 27 people had been arrested in the killings 
of the suspected witches in the eastern state which borders 
bangladesh 
basu had no details on how the women were killed or who was 
arrested but he said the women were slain only because they were 
suspected of practicing witchcraft 
tribal members in parts of west bengal believe that many women 
especially widows have the power to heal the sick and the ability 
to cast evil spells women thought to be witches often are attacked 
when misfortune befalls members of the tribe 
there is no such woman as the storybook witch mrs 
chakrabarty told a news conference in calcutta capital of west 
bengal state 
it is unthinkable that jyoti basu leading a marxist 
government which believes neither in god nor the devil should 
nonchalantly reel out figures of the murders of innocent women as a 
piece of statistics 
mrs chakrabarty said she is the eastern high priestess of a 
montrealbased coven which she refused to identify further 
she told reporters that she lived in the canadian city when she 
was a young woman before returning to her parents home in calcutta 
in 1968 to complete her education she majored in english 
literature and taught at a prestigious secondary school before her 
marriage 
her husband is a government official but she prefers not to 
publicize his name and job title for fear of repercussions the 
couple has a 10yearold daughter 
witchcraft is not black magic and it need not necessarily be 
evil mrs chakrabarty said it can be misused but that 
depends on the practitioner any science can be evil if put into 
the wrong hands 
i as the high priestess of a witches coven claim that we 
have worked successfully for the benefit of individuals who have 
been suffering from various disorders she said we are not 
superwomen but we have succeeded in helping where conventional 
science has failed 
mrs chakrabarty said witches use water electrically charged by 
touch or rock quartz to cure the sick 
our touch can calm our eyes can comfort or impart energy if 
the need be so she said we believe that the powers we invoke 
from the outer elements charge us with a certain strength which 
can pass onto others

fire still smoldered today at a 400foot 
crater in the ruins of a rocket fuel plant destroyed by 
earthquakeforce explosions that flattened an industrial park 
leaving one person dead one missing and injuring more than 250 
this thing could have been much worse we may have a 
miracle on our hands here gov richard bryan said late wednesday 
after blasts shattered windows 10 miles away in las vegas and 
tweaked seismographs 200 miles away 
the detonations destroyed or severely damaged 12 buildings at 
the site of the pacific engineering and production co of nevada 
plant and an adjoining marshmallow factory 
the blasts at least three powerful concussions and a string of 
lesser explosions peeled off roofs upended cars and even rocked 
a jetliner in flight more than 250 people were injured four 
critically most from flying glass 
the tattered body found in the ruins was identified today as 
bruce bernard halker 56 vice president of operations at pacific 
engineering a search continued for another possible victim 
we have a missing person but were not sure what it is maybe 
the person just left and hasnt contacted anyone said clark 
county deputy fire chief john pappageorge 
bryan said he was declaring the blast zone and its environs a 
state disaster area and would seek federal disaster relief for 
this southern nevada desert community of 54000 
all the windows are smashed in and the roofs are peeled 
back the governor said in one shopping center all the glass 
is blown out and the top part of the building caved in the force 
had to be enormous 
this morning fire still smoldered at the ruined plant said 
pappageorge but it was not threatening or causing firefighters any 
problems the blasts left a crater 400 feet across 
right now there are no fumes that are emitting from the ruins 
that were aware of pappageorge said on the cbs this morning 
program the last measurement that was taken the particles were 
measured at zero 
he said of the low death toll unbelievable would be the word 
as my first thoughts when i arrived out there was there would 
probably be several hundred but its remarkable there was only 
one 
the explosions also spewed a 5squaremile plume of toxic smoke 
into the sky but winds carried the cloud away from populated areas 
and it eventually dissipated by nightfall evacuated residents 
were back at home 
pacific is one of two manufacturers of ammonium perchlorate an 
oxidizer in fuel for the space shuttles solid rocket boosters and 
the minuteman and titan missiles the other is kerrmcgee also 
near las vegas 
the explosions and fire were caused by an equipment malfunction 
said pacific president fred gibson jr no monetary estimate of the 
damage was available 
the first explosion at 1153 am measured about 30 on the 
richter scale and the second at 1157 am had a magnitude 35 
said bob finn spokesman for the california institute of 
technology 200 miles away in pasadena 
i find that absolutely amazing that is extremely powerful 
said finn 
it flipped cars over knocked pedestrians to the ground and 
windows in the whole town shattered said susan russo 37 of 
henderson who was in her pickup truck when the blasts occurred 
it felt like somebody sent me back to vietnam said rick 
rieckmann 41 a maintenance welder who was one of four plant 
workers hurled through a wall in the first blast 
it blew us out of the building it sent us through a 
fiberglass wall and into the desert rieckmann said none of the 
four was seriously hurt 
gamblers briefly abandoned gaming tables at several casinos on 
the outskirts of las vegas but ducked back inside after it was 
clear the danger had passed 
a las vegasbound jetliner approaching mccarran international 
airport was rattled by the blasts said america west passenger john 
conrad 62 of westlake village calif 
we felt a little jolt the second explosion looked like a 
miniatomic bomb he said there was a tall column of smoke 
going up 20000 feet 
the pacific plant employed about 300 workers and about 200 of 
them on duty wednesday fled seconds before the first blast fire 
chief roy parrish said 
employees tried to put the fire out but it got out of control 
most of the employees had exited the building or were in the 
foothills when the first explosion occurred seconds later there 
was a second explosion that completely demolished the building 
parrish said 
kidd amp co based in ligonier ind expanded to the gibson 
business park and opened its 36500squarefoot marshmallow plant 
about two years ago it employed 85 people but only 25 to 35 were 
on duty at the time of the blast

an assault team stormed a secluded 
island cave in this french pacific territory thursday and freed 23 
hostages in a bloody rescue mission that left 17 people dead 
authorities said 
fifteen of the dead were melanesian separatists holding the 
captives and two were rescuers said bernard pons frances 
minister for overseas territories 
the team pelted the cave with tear gas canisters forcing most 
of the estimated 30 captors out pons told reporters in the 
capital noumea a particularly violent battle ensued he said 
three members of the assault team and three captors were injured 
in the nearly sevenhour battle in the thick underbrush of ouvea 
island in the loyalty island group he said 
the hostages 22 gendarmes and an assistant prosecutor were 
seized in two groups on april 22 and april 27 by melanesian 
separatists seeking independence for the island and protesting 
frenchdominated regional elections april 24 
the hostages freed their manacled hands with a key that had been 
sneaked in earlier and defended themselves with two pistols also 
obtained before the attack pons said 
taking advantage of the smoke created by tear gas bombs the 
hostages were able to escape through a chimney in the back of the 
cave he said 
the key and pistols had been smuggled in by capt philippe 
legorjus a hostage who at one point acted as intermediary leaving 
the cave for talks with french government officials 
during the negotiations the kidnappers told legorjus the other 
hostages would be killed if he did not return to the cave 
the situation inside the cave had become extremely 
dangerous defense minister andre giraud said in paris in any 
case it was entirely intolerable that representatives of the 
forces of order might be held hostage 
the rescue operation was carried out by an elite gendarmes 
squad paratroopers a marine commando unit and a special action 
unit of the french counterespionage agency military officials 
said 
the kanak socialist national liberation front the main 
melanesian separatist organization called for a mobilization to 
protest the assault which it called colonial barbary 
this will not stop the determination of the kanak people in 
their demand for independence jeanmarie tjibaou the front 
president told the associated press by telephone from his home in 
hienghene at the northern end of the main island 
premier jacques chirac said the operation was infinitely 
difficult given the rough terrain on ouvea and the almost 
inaccessable location of the cave the cave is at the bottom of a 
50yardby30yard crater 
he said it was decided on after friendly attempts to free 
the hostages failed 
chirac called on caledonians to work together for mutual 
understanding dialogue and a peaceful solution to the problems of 
new caledonia 
this french territory has clearly spoken about its wish to 
remain french he said in apparent reference to the elections 
the front boycotted the voting in which profrench settlers 
dominated 
the separatists took captive 27 gendarmes police under military 
orders in an attack on a police station april 22 in which four 
gendarmes were hacked to death 
eleven were freed three days later but on april 27 seven 
gendarmes and the assistant prosecutor were captured when they went 
to the hideout for negotiations a sick hostage also was freed that 
day 
besides cancelling regional elections the militants were 
demanding that hundreds of french troops be removed from ouvea and 
that a mediator be sent to discuss independence for the 
archipelago a french territory since 1853 
fortythree percent of the territorys 145000 inhabitants are 
native melanesians most of whom want independence european 
settlers make up 36 percent of the population with the rest asian 
and polynesian 
interior minister charles pasqua speaking on television 
defended the decision to take action saying you dont make an 
omelette without breaking eggs 
pasqua said he did not know if chirac decided on the assault 
before or after news of the release of three french hostages in 
lebanon 
jeanmarie le pen of the extreme right national front praised 
the operation and implied that similar tactics should have been 
used in lebanon 
there is only one way to deal with terrorists that used in 
ouvea he said

with heated races for governor and 
state supreme court competing for the voters attention sen 
robert c byrds bid for a sixth term has attracted little notice 
in west virginia and thats just fine with him 
byrd who recently announced he is giving up his post as senate 
majority leader faces only a nominal challenge in tuesdays 
democratic primary 
the 71yearold politician who has become a fiddleplaying 
institution in the mountain state held several fundraisers last 
fall but plans no campaign stops and no media blitz before the 
primary said tina evans a spokeswoman for the senator 
in the early stages of the campaign i am focusing on talking 
with individual west virginians getting around the state and 
working for west virginia in the senate byrd said 
his only opponent in the primary is 59yearold former state 
board of education member bob e myers who says no one should be 
allowed to run unopposed especially in a sixyear office 
byrd has amassed a 1988 election war chest of more than 1 
million while myers said in his latest spending report that he has 
raised nothing and spent 212 
in the republican primary freshman state sen jay wolfe faces 
bernie lumbert of buckhannon a welfare recipient whose campaign 
consists maily of telephoning reporters to relate tales of 
conspiracies by public officials 
byrds announcement that he would give up his majority leader 
job amid growing dissatisfaction over his style of leadership among 
fellow democrats in washington he said that if democrats retain 
control of the senate next year he would assume the chairmanship 
of the senate appropriations committee in an effort to funnel more 
federal dollars to west virginia 
byrd acknowledged that the economic recovery that other 
regions have enjoyed for the most part bypassed our state 
he said he cannot work miracles but will have a new 
opportunity to have a more direct influence on the allocation of 
our nations scarce fiscal resources 
byrds move has been labeled a demotion by some political 
observers and republican gov arch moore said he would be 
hardpressed to suggest west virginians will notice any 
difference as a result of the change 
wolfe 33 decided to try for byrds senate seat after backing 
out of the gubernatorial primary in which he would have faced 
moore and morgantown millionaire john raese 
wolfe flew to washington earlier this year to discuss his plans 
with the republican national senatorial committee and hopes to 
raise at least 250000 for the general election 
in the state senate wolfe primarily has been a proponent of 
righttowork legislation and also has called for a constitutional 
amendment to prohibit abortion on demand 
lumbert 57 said he is on welfare and cannot afford to spend 
money on the election he said he campaigns as often as he can 
for free by addressing groups and organizations but his 
requests to speak to groups nearly always are turned down 
im a very hated person lumbert said im probably the 
most despised person in the state 
the primary ballot will be crowded with contests including 
moore vs raese and seven democrats competing for their partys 
nomination for governor in addition five democrats are battling 
for two nominations to the state supreme court including 
incumbents darrell mcgraw and thomas miller two issues in the 
bitter campaign have been allegations that the court is 
antibusiness and complaints about mcgraws repeated runins with 
court employees sheriffs deputies lawyers amd reporters

soviet and us veterans of the cold war today 
proposed that the united states and the soviet union stop 
intervening in the developing world as a step toward reducing their 
military competition 
the motto for the group might be no more afghanistans no more 
vietnams said arthur macy cox a former cia official who 
organized the effort with georgi arbatov an adviser to kremlin 
leader mikhail s gorbachev and head of moscows usacanada 
institute 
in a position paper issued at a washington news conference the 
soviets and americans called for the progressive demilitarization 
of ussoviet competition including sharp cuts in strategic 
nuclear and conventional arsenals elimination of chemical weapons 
and adherence to the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
all those areas are under negotiation between the superpowers 
the proposal breaks new ground by proposing a deal to end the 
cold war in the developing world saying we believe that 
military intervention by the superpowers in regional conflicts has 
reached a dangerous dead end and should be terminated by mutual 
agreements 
the difficulty of interpreting such an agreement became evident 
during the news conference as cox and arbatov professing 
unanimity could not agree whether the use of prosoviet cuban 
troops in angola constituted proxy forces which would be 
barred under the proposal 
the us government calls cuban forces used in third world 
conflicts soviet proxies 
i cannot regard them as proxy forces said arbatov 
describing the cubans as friends 
we regard them as proxy forces said cox 
whether the cubans are soviet proxies or merely friends said 
arbatov superpower intervention in the developing world is 
counterproductive 
cox said that the two sides did not discuss the 1981 martial law 
crackdown against the solidarity trade union in poland as a form of 
indirect soviet intervention 
there was no intervention by the red army or proxies into 
poland said cox 
the reagan administration took a radically different 
interpretation at the time of the military crackdown then 
secretary of defense caspar w weinberger described polish leader 
gen wojciech jaruzelski as a russian in a polish uniform 
arbatov told a news conference that although many of the ideas 
in the paper reflect kremlin views it was a purely unofficial 
exercise 
the time is ripe for a us soviet rapprochement far better 
than during detente said one american in the group townsend 
hoopes undersecretary of the air force under president lyndon 
johnson the americans were all members of the american committee 
on ussoviet relations and include former cia director william 
colby former undersecretary of state george ball and former sen 
john culver 
detente a period of thawing superpower relations under 
presidents nixon ford and carter produced a series of arms 
control agreements and increased trade between the superpowers but 
floundered amid us accusations that the soviets were continuing 
their military buildup and using force to install allied 
governments in the developing world 
we have a clear idea of why detente was ruined hoopes said 
in an interview the soviets understood detente to exclude behavior 
in the developing world the opposite of the us understanding 
this time says hoopes we are convinced of the sincerity on 
the russian side

preliminary peace talks this 
week marked an unprecedented step toward ending angolas civil war 
but the warring parties face a daunting task in securing an outcome 
that allows them all to save face 
since the war began in 1975 the antagonists have been given to 
belligerent talk it will not be easy for them to tone down their 
rhetoric if they feel that national honor is at stake 
south africa has justified its support of the angolan rebel 
movement unita as necessary to thwart a communist onslaught in 
southern africa angolas marxist government backed by 40000 
cuban troops and about 1000 soviet advisers has derided unita as 
a puppet of south africas racist regime 
the twoday talks in london placed cuba angola and south africa 
at the same bargaining table for the first time a joint communique 
issued wednesday said they would meet again soon 
us assistant secretary of state chester crocker who served as 
chairman said the session was an important step toward withdrawal 
of cuban and south african troops from angola and independence for 
southwest africa the south africancontrolled territory known as 
namibia 
but it is fair to be skeptical crocker said there are 
big tough issues that lie ahead 
among those issues 
unita which was excluded from the london talks insists that 
it must be included eventually the rebels leader jonas savimbi 
is reviled by angolan government officials but he is a proud 
selfconfident commander who is unlikely to stand aside in the 
interests of a settlement the united states which helps arm the 
rebels says it wont abandon him 
angola will not want to be seen by other third world countries 
as yielding to the whiteminority rulers of south africa mere 
withdrawal of south african troops from its territory is unlikely 
to suffice and angola will probably insist on unconditional 
independence for namibia 
south african negotiators will likely balk at any steps that 
could be depicted by extremeright whites as capitulation to 
sovietbloc pressure there is skepticism about south africas 
public commitment to allowing unsupervised independence 
elections in namibia once cuban troops leave angola such elections 
would likely be won by the southwest african peoples 
organization the leftist guerrilla movement that has been fighting 
south african rule for 22 years south africa may pursue some 
arrangement that would lessen swapos chances of taking power 
even as the talks concluded the hostile rhetoric continued 
an angolan general claimed his troops had forced a retreat by 
unita and south african units in southern angola such boasts true 
or false are unlikely to induce concessions from south african 
leaders who view conservative whites as their main constituency 
in south africa the staterun broadcasting company issued a 
commentary describing cubas troop deployment as the central 
problem 
as in the case of the soviet troops in afghanistan the cubans 
in angola have been the cause of the destruction of that country 
the destabilization of the region and a growing threat to the 
strategic interests of the western world the south african 
broadcasting corp said 
south africas foreign minister roelof pik botha suggested 
that his country might try to play upon the us governments 
apparent eagerness to broker a settlement 
botha said us congressmen should understand that further 
sanctions against south africa would jeopardize the peace 
negotiations 
balancing the potential obstacles to peace are several factors 
conducive to a settlement perhaps foremost is the increasing cost 
of the war which has become the most intense conventional warfare 
in africa since world war ii 
the soviet union which supplies the cubanangolan forces 
appears interested in a nonmilitary settlement angola knows its 
battered economy cannot be rehabilitated without peace and it 
reportedly has held secret talks with unita recently south africa 
would like to avoid raising the death toll of its white conscripts 
the london talks focused on an angolan proposal for cuban troops 
to stage a phased withdrawal while south africa pulled its forces 
out of angola and namibia 
cuba has suggested a fouryear timetable and wants unita to be 
barred from military operations south africa has said the cuban 
withdrawal must be completed before it would begin moves toward 
namibian independence 
the cubans came to angola in 1975 helping the marxist movement 
which now runs the government to win a power struggle with unita 
following independence from portugal 
the united states has been trying for eight years to get the 
cubans out of angola but crocker said pressure for a settlement 
was on the warring parties not the united states because it is 
after all their boys who are dying

congressional demands that americas allies 
pay more for defense are misguided and amount to a highstakes 
game of chicken that the united states cant afford to play 
defense secretary frank c carlucci said thursday 
carlucci addressing the foreign policy association in new york 
city said recent attacks in congress on the north atlantic treaty 
organization and other allies like japan and south korea suggest 
a growing inclination towards isolationism a kind of withdrawal 
syndrome from our international obligations and interests 
it is now quite commonly assumed that the united states 
carries more than its fair share of the burdens of alliance 
defense and that in return america gets little in the way of 
support or even appreciation from its allies the defense 
secretary said 
calls for cutting back our contributions to our alliances or 
punishing allies who fail to contribute more are getting a 
hearing these proposals are sometimes recommended as a sort of 
shock treatment that will result in our allies deciding to shoulder 
more responsibility for alliance security 
well i do not think we should risk our security interests in 
what is in effect little more than a highstakes game of chicken 
we cannot trust to chance americas national security 
the pentagon released a copy of the speech in washington 
carlucci aides described the address as a statement of policy aimed 
at the growing number of members of congress who have begun 
attacking the nato alliance 
last week the house voted on two different proposals to reduce 
the number of american troops in europe while both proposals were 
defeated the debate featured harsh attacks on nato by the two 
sponsors reps john bryant dtexas and tommy robinson dark 
lets get smart and begin to tell our allies that we expect 
them to pay their fair share bryant said at the time we are 
subsidizing their defense 
robinson was even more blunt the real purpose of this 
amendment is to demonstrate to our allies that weve had it these 
people are stealing our jobs because we have been suckered into 
paying for their defense 
but in his speech carlucci said the united states does not 
maintain alliances as a favor to our allies we do so because it 
is in our interest collective security and the strategy of forward 
defense have been central to our national security for more than 
four decades 
over and beyond military factors americas economy depends upon 
international trade the secretary continued 
and we cannot expect to protect those interests and prosper if 
we isolate ourselves from the rest of the world carlucci said 
the implications for our national security should be clear we 
cannot hope to expand our economic horizons at the very moment we 
scale back our international security commitments 
on the other hand there is no question but that there remains 
room for improvement on defense spending among the allies he 
said 
determining an equitable allocation of roles risks and 
responsibilities among 16 sovereign nato partners is not an easy 
task carlucci said 
but clearly the united states will be hard pressed to 
persuade its allies to do more to bolster their defenses if we 
ourselves succumb to the temptation to do less he concluded

nationality has become somewhat irrelevant 
at the german heritage days as a british family is serving as 
honored guests the reason their last name is mccook 
tom and carol mccook and their children sarah helen and james 
have been getting the vip treatment in mccook this week and will 
serve as grand marshals of the german days parade saturday 
the idea for their journey began a year ago when sarah 13 was 
looking over a map and spotted the town of mccook 
she wondered how it got its name and i said it was probably 
named after a cattle rustler who got hung tom mccook joked 
according to perkeys nebraska place names mccook was named in 
honor of alexander mcdowell mccook a union general in the civil 
war 
sarah wrote to the mccook daily gazette requesting information 
about the city in march 1987 editor jack rogers sent her a 
centennial edition and many residents mailed letters 
through the correspondence she became a regular pen pal of 
three children and last summer a fundraising drive was begun to 
bring her to mccook 
enough money was raised to pay for sarah and one other family 
member to visit and the mccooks paid expenses for the rest of the 
family

a house committee approved legislation today 
urging the transportation department to widen its investigation of 
eastern airlines and its parent company texas air corp 
by a voice vote the public works and transportation committee 
sent the measure to the full house the resolution already has 210 
cosponsors nearly half the houses membership 
the resolution is nonbinding and simply states that the 
department of transportation should look more closely at the 
management labor practices and safety procedures of texas air and 
eastern 
but the issue has aroused strong feelings among lawmakers whom 
the companys management and labor unions have been lobbying hard 
for support the airline has been seeking wage concessions from 
workers and the two sides have been fighting each other for months 
in congress the courts and in newspaper advertisements 
morale is very much related to ability to do the job said 
the measures original sponsor rep norman mineta dcalif 
chairman of the house aviation subcommittee and to me that very 
much becomes a safety concern 
the transportation department said last month that it would 
examine the management and business practices of texas air 
eastern and continental airlines another texas affiliate the 
congressional resolution calls on the department to look more 
closely at how texas airs and easterns practices affect the 
public 
in another development eastern asked a federal appeals panel 
today to overturn a contempt citation and injunction barring the 
sale of its shuttle but the court questioned whether it had 
jurisdiction in the case 
philip a lacovara an attorney representing the financially 
troubled airline told the us court of appeals panel that selling 
the northeast shuttle operations was essential to easterns 
ability to survive 
eastern last year arranged to sell its profitable bostonnew 
yorkwashington shuttle to a newly created texas air subsidiary for 
225 million 
the international association of machinists and aerospace 
workers aflcio challenged the proposed sale and transfer to the 
new subsidiary of about 6000 jobs claiming a violation of the 
collective bargaining agreement 
this is part and parcel of a scheme to dismantle eastern 
airlines to rid texas air of its only unionized subsidiary 
contended union attorney joseph guerrieri jr 
in march us district judge john h pratt held eastern in 
contempt for trying to sell the shuttle in violation of his july 2 
1987 injunction directing eastern to maintain the status quo under 
its contract with the union he barred eastern from taking further 
steps to sell the shuttle 
appeals court judge harry edwards told lacovara that since the 
case was still pending before pratt and contempt citations could 
rarely be appealed there was doubt as to whether the appeals court 
had jurisdiction at this stage 
there is a significant question as to whether you are properly 
here because contempt citations are not generally appealable 
edwards said 
eastern contends that the proposed sale is a managerial 
prerogative that does not affect the collective bargaining 
agreement the union says the sale is in violation of the railway 
labor act because it changes working conditions without an attempt 
at bargaining

a fire raged through five floors of a 
62story office tower today killing a man trapped in an elevator 
and injuring at least 40 people while a rescue helicopter plucked 
10 people from the top of the citys tallest building 
it looked like dantes inferno fire capt steve varney 
said everything that was burnable burned down it was just 
metal and that was red hot 
the fire broke out before 11 pm wednesday on the 12th floor of 
the first interstate bank building and was put out shortly after 2 
am today said firefighter gary svider the cause of the fire was 
under investigation

white smoke poured through other floors glass from fireshattered 
windows sprayed the street

fire hoses and fire capt mike bowers said firefighters couldnt 
replace the hoses because they also could be cut 
some firefighters landed on the roof by helicopter and worked 
their way down to lower floors 
firefighters searched the floors above the burning levels for 
other people fire chief donald manning said 
one fire official said the blaze frustrated firefighters because 
they had to use portable oxygen tanks 
were running out of air real quick said capt steve 
varney youve got to walk up 15 stories and by the time you get 
to the 15th story you run out of air after five minutes thats no 
way to fight a fire 
tom scalia 29 said he was working on a sprinkler system for 
cosco fire protection when the blaze broke out 
we were installing sprinklers and they are not in service at 
all said scalia 
fire inspector ed reed who has been with the department for 23 
years said the blaze was the worst highrise fire in the history 
of the nations secondlargest city in terms of severity and damage 
four helicopters with searchlights swooped around the rooftop to 
locate people and a police department helicopter lifted 10 people 
from the roof officers said 
we came out and we couldnt see anything but smoke said 
radmila radich a cleaning woman who escaped 
the fire chief said the building contained no sprinkler system 
because it was built before local fire codes were modified to 
require them the water system in the buildings standpipe to be 
used in case of fire was turned off at the time the fire broke 
out because it was being upgraded he said 
manning said it was lucky the fire did not strike during the day 
you might have 6000 or 7000 people in there all trying to 
exit through heavy smoke the chances are we would have had a lot 
of injuries a lot of fatalities manning said on cbs this 
morning

a 24yearold man pleaded innocent today to 
15 counts of seconddegree murder and one count of arson in 
connection with a rooming house fire that killed 15 people four 
years ago on the fourth of july 
james carver broke down shaking and in tears during the 
reading of the indictment in salem superior court before judge 
peter brady he left the courtroom for 15 minutes to regain his 
composure 
carver of ipswich was accompanied by his wife maryjane 21 
his parents and his attorney dennis jackson 
carver was arrested wednesday night on a warrant after an essex 
county grand jury handed up a sealed indictment brady set bail at 
1 million surety or 10000 cash a pretrial conference was set 
for may 23 
jealousy and a lovetriangle were the apparent motives essex 
county district attorney kevin burke said today he said carver 
formerly was engaged to a woman who was dating a resident of the 
boarding house the alleged target of carvers jealousy died in the 
fire 
burke said carver was among many early suspects because he had 
been seen around the rooming house right after the fire but he 
said the case was cracked when an unidentified individual told 
police that carver had confessed 
but jackson said carver was asleep at home in danvers when the 
fire broke out jackson said carver feels pretty strongly that 
they dont have a case against him but that he was not surprised 
by the indictment 
the july 4 1984 predawn fire at the elliott chambers rooming 
house was the worst in beverlys history 
it shocked local and state officials into improving safety for 
boarding houses which accommodate people who often have nowhere 
else to go 
the 36 people staying at the seedy 35yearold rooming house 
the night of the fire were a mix of the elderly welfare 
recipients people released from psychiatric hospitals and drifters 
the fire began in the front stairway of the threestory wooden 
building trapping people inside the building had no sprinklers 
although it had a new fire alarm 
flames raced up the stairs and through the top floor trapping 
six people in their beds others died while trying to beat down a 
locked entryway one man died after jumping from a thirdstory 
window all told 14 people died in the fire and another died later 
six of the dead were so badly charred they could only be 
identified through dental records and jewelry found on their bodies 
investigators said the fire was deliberately set and that it was 
started in newspapers inside a locked front door 
in the aftermath of the fire in this town 25 miles north of 
boston fire officials stepped up enforcement of safety codes the 
state department of mental health expanded fire safety training for 
mentally ill patients and the state enacted a law giving the 
communities the option to require sprinklers in rooming houses 
after the fire the building was converted to office space

an prominent labor activist freed from a 
polish jail so he could receive medical treatment abroad said 
thursday he was forced off a plane and deported after he flew back 
to poland 
morawiecki leader of a militant splinter group of the outlawed 
trade union federation solidarity said polish officials initially 
told him he would be allowed to return home then blocked his 
attempt to return wednesday 
morawiecki a 47yearold physicist is the head of the 
underground group known as fighting solidarity 
he was flown from poland last week just as a series of tense 
labor strikes and political demonstrations were beginning he was 
allowed out under a deal worked out by the roman catholic church 
i think the church was cheated as much as i was the 
authorities broke their guarantee to me and to the church that i 
would be able to go back he said 
in warsaw a polish government official confirmed that 
morawiecki tried to return home wednesday the official said 
morawiecki was given the choice of jail or leaving the country and 
chose to leave 
morawiecki said he was jailed in november while authorities 
investigated what he called bogus charges of smuggling 
speaking through an interpreter morawiecki said he and fellow 
prisoner andrzej kolodzej were released from jail in warsaw on 
saturday on the condition they travel to rome for medical treatment 
but after learning of the labor strikes in poland the men 
refused to board the plane and were returned to prison morawiecki 
said 
two intermediaries from the roman catholic church persuaded the 
men to depart arguing that refusal to leave would jeopardize 
church efforts to solve similar cases for other prisoners 
morawiecki said 
the men flew to rome he said kolodzej started to receive 
treatment for suspected duodenal cancer but morawiecki said 
doctors found nothing seriously wrong with him and he decided to 
return to poland 
polish authorities had given the men passports containing stamps 
permitting them to return to poland until 1991 he said 
however morawiecki said he was denied permission tuesday to 
board a flight from rome to warsaw on polish lot airlines the next 
day he took a flight from frankfurt to warsaw but was taken from 
the plane by police held for four or five hours and then put on a 
plane for vienna 
morawiecki said authorities canceled the stamp on his passport 
allowing him to return to poland

malaria continues to pose a risk for us 
travelers to many countries striking about 1000 a year federal 
experts said thursday 
the national centers for disease control in its weekly report 
reviewed for physicians and other health and travel professionals 
the details of pretravel precautions and postinfection treatment 
for malaria 
the disease which causes fever and flulike symptoms and can be 
fatal is transmitted by mosquitoes 
although malaria is almost never reported in the united states 
transmission continues in parts of central and south america 
subsaharan africa the indian subcontinent southeast asia the 
middle east and the pacific islands the cdc said 
all travelers to malariaendemic areas are advised to use an 
appropriate drug regimen and personal protection measures to 
prevent malaria the cdc said however travelers must be 
informed that regardless of methods employed malaria can still be 
contracted 
the cdc recommends that most travelers to malaria areas begin 
taking antimalaria drugs a week or two before travel continuing 
during the trip and for four weeks afterward 
in some areas the drug chloroquine should be sufficient but 
resistance to that drug has become widespread in malaria areas the 
cdc said 
thats the reason that nowadays the risk of malaria is much 
higher than it used to be said dr hans lobel a cdc malaria 
specialist 
an alternate drug fansidar can cause severe and even fatal 
skin reactions the cdc cautioned travelers to areas with 
chloroquineresistant malaria should carry a dose of fansidar and 
take it only if they develop a feverish illness when professional 
care is not available the atlantabased agency said 
we really discourage the drug its caused so many serious 
adverse reactions lobel said we are really waiting for some 
more effective and safer drugs to come down 
each year malaria strikes about 1000 americans traveling 
abroad lobel said noting that if a traveler takes no precautions 
the risk in an area such as west africa is about one in 50 
the risk in kenya where many americans traveling to africa 
visit is about one in 200 
in addition to drug precautions the cdc urges travelers in 
malaria areas to take other precautions at night when mosquitoes 
feed these include wearing clothes that cover most of the body and 
using mosquito nets and insect repellent

a company that produces heavy water which 
can be used to make nuclear weapons said thursday it was confident 
its workers followed all the rules in shipping 15 tons of heavy 
water that disappeared 
the foreign ministry said police were beginning a criminal 
investigation into the apparent misdirection of the heavy water 
which was to have been delivered to west germany in 1983 
we are very strict on following all the rules for exporting 
heavy water said petter a christoffersen spokesman for norsk 
hydro as which produces the water we are quite certain that 
all the rules have been followed to the last comma 
he said norsk hydro had given all its files and papers on the 
matter to investigators 
foreign ministry spokesman lasse seim said the government traced 
the airfreighted consignment to basel switzerland but lost track 
of it there he said west germany also was been asked to 
investigate 
a report in the newspaper verdens gang which broke the story 
april 21 said the material was sent to dubai in the persian gulf 
and probably shipped to india from there 
norway refuses to sell heavy water to india because it has not 
signed the nuclear nonproliferation agreement 
heavy water or deuterium oxide looks like ordinary water but 
has an extra neutron and cools a nuclear reactor by moderating the 
speed of neutrons released in a chain reaction 
it enables the reactor to run on natural uranium instead of 
enriched uranium fuel and to produce plutonium which can be used 
for nuclear weapons 
about 40 of the worlds 330 research reactors and 28 of the 387 
nuclear power stations that were operating in 1986 use heavy water 
for peaceful purposes christoffersen said 
norway has made heavy water since the 1930s as a byproduct of 
ammonia fertilizer and norsk hydro norways only producer has 
made about 1020 tons annually over the last 30 years 
christoffersen said that is about 2 percent of world production 
german occupation forces took over the norwegian factory in 
world war ii and it was the subject of the movie heroes of 
telemark in 1965 
norwegian resistance fighters blew up the factory hampering 
germanys nuclear research it reopened after the war but ammonia 
production there has stopped 
norway tightened regulations on sensitive exports earlier this 
year after a weapons factory was found to have sold technology to 
the soviet union that would enable it to build quieter submarines

preliminary results show that two of 
three joints on the redesigned space shuttle booster rocket did not 
leak during an april 22 qualifying test a nasa official said today 
dave mobley nasa deputy project manager for the redesign 
effort said that engineers have inspected the aft and center field 
joints and found both to be working as designed results of tests 
on the forward joint are expected friday 
mobley said today that engineers found that the center field 
joint which had an intentional flaw built into it for an april 22 
testfiring at the morton thiokol plant 25 miles west of here did 
its job 
he said the center field joint flaw allowed superhot gases to 
reach insulation and the joints oring but the ring held 
there was no damage to the oring at all he said there 
was no evidence the gas got past the ring 
failure of an oring seal is blamed for triggering the jan 28 
1986 explosion that destroyed the space shuttle challenger and 
killed its sevenmember crew 
the booster tests are designed to evaluate the redesigned 
booster which is made up of several sections that are joined 
together and qualify the joints for use in an actual launch 
mobley also said engineers found no damage to the rockets 
nozzle section in a december testfiring a redesigned boot ring 
on the section came apart 
the april test used a boot ring that had proven reliable in the 
past 
mobley said engineering evaluations would be conducted late 
today on the redesigned boosters forward field joint with results 
expected friday he noted that while thorough results from the 
evaluations were tentative 
a final report based on more extensive study isnt expected to 
be ready for several weeks he said 
two more fullscale tests of the booster are planned for june 
and july and the shuttle launch is tentatively set for late august 
or early september

illegal aliens in this country face a 
miserable existence of exploitation on the job as immigration 
authorities move their emphasis from amnesty to employer sanctions 
according to groups working with undocumented residents 
life could get worse for the undocumented beginning june 1 when 
the employer penalty program becomes fully operational under the 
november 1986 immigration law if the concept works jobs will grow 
more scarce for the undocumented 
the concern is that employers who choose to violate the law 
may reduce wages and lower working conditions because these 
folks unlike in the past are not going to be able to quit and 
go somewhere else to work said charles kamasaki of the national 
council of la raza a hispanic advocacy organization 
the ins this month will end its yearlong phasein period for 
the sanctions during which first offenders were only issued 
warnings for knowingly hiring illegal aliens 
starting june 1 violaters face heavy fines whether a first or 
repeat offender in the phasein period there were 2200 citations 
issued against repeat violators and 80 fines imposed totaling 
250000 
bud coster ins associate commissioner for enforcement said the 
agency will have 8500 enforcement personnel to deal with the 
sanctions program although voluntary compliance still will be 
stressed 
the program of employer education and financial penalties is 
designed to dry up jobs for illegal aliens which by ins estimates 
could number 4 million following the end of wednesdays amnesty 
application period 
the fear is that people will be forced further underground 
into a more clandestine labor market said the rev monsignor 
nicholas dimarzio director of migration and refugee services for 
the us catholic conference they will have few if any rights 
or the ability to get out of those situations 
dimarzio said aliens facing a declining job market have few 
if any rights for the people who are stuck it will be a 
rather miserable existence 
kamasaki director of policy analysis for la raza said for 
people who dont have work it will be tougher to get a job for 
those who have jobs it will be more difficult to quit 
employers are going to have substantially more leverage over 
their undocumented employees than they did before the law passed 
groups in contact with the aliens predicted relatively few will 
go back to their native lands 
some fear political persecution in countries such as nicaragua 
el salvador guatemala honduras and lately panama others face 
such terrible poverty in their native lands that they will take the 
risk of getting caught by staying in the unite states if deported 
they would only be sent back home anyway 
jess quintero a vice president with the league of united latin 
american citizens said while aliens may not go home some may end 
up in canada 
some of us have personally spoken with salvadorans who have 
now left for canada quintero said they tried to get 
documented in the united states and were turned down as little as 
three weeks ago when they arrived in canada they were immediately 
accepted for documentation 
linda wong immigration director for the mexicanamerican legal 
defense and educational fund in los angeles said many aliens would 
remain in the country illegally as a last desperate effort to 
find security 
they have tried to make it on their own in their country of 
origin and were not able to support themselves and families she 
said 
she predicted that the illegal aliens will manage to get 
work because some employers will take the chance that they wont 
be caught but she said the available work will not be the type 
that will produce increased security for alien families much of 
the work will be temporary she said 
ms wong said a recent decline in public school enrollment of 
hispanicsurnamed students in her city could be a result of the 
1986 immigration law 
illegal aliens she said fear the immigration service will go 
to public schools and pick up students as well as parents 
and as job opportunities decrease she said there will be 
increased pressure on schoolage children to become principal 
breadwinners for families

the french jubilant at the return of their last 
three hostages from lebanon seemed largely impervious thursday to 
complaints that france had dealt with terrorists while 18 other 
foreigners remain captive 
the french government denied any deals were struck or payments 
made 
i think its thoroughly bad said peter templemorris the 
parliamentary specialist on lebanon for britains conservative 
party no responsible nation and no responsible government and 
i say that directly to the french government and the french people 
should deal with terrorism 
brazen and cynical added david owen of the social democrats 
in washington the reagan administration reiterated its refusal 
to deal with kidnappers we hope that deals were not made of a 
kind that we object to in our own policies on terrorism said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
french premier jacques chirac who received credit for the 
release four days before facing president francois mitterrand in 
presidential elections said after greeting the hostages thursday 
we have never ceased to act with dignity and honor conforming 
strictly to values shared with other countries adhering strictly 
to the grand principles of our foreign policy to those of our 
friends 
media reports said france agreed to pay iran the remaining 400 
million of a longstanding 1 billion loan frozen after the islamic 
revolution in 1979 
persistent speculation is that chirac also agreed to temper arms 
sales to iraq irans enemy in a 7yearold war and increase 
those to iran along with a direct payment labeled for some other 
purpose none of this could be confirmed 
interior minister charles pasqua insisted we have not ceded 
to any claim we have not accorded any funds of any sort to anyone 
not a franc not a dollar not a deutschmark not a yen 
 
peggy say sister of associated press correspondent terry 
anderson who has been held hostage since march 1985 said she 
thinks the united states is doing little to free the hostages it 
almost appears the french government places a higher priority on 
the lives of their people than the american government does she 
said in batavia ny 
despite the government denials remy leveau professor and 
middle east expert at the prestigious political sciences institute 
said he was certain a deal had been struck even so he said it 
would not encourage terrorists 
 
this phenomenon has become generalized and it is with you 
whether you pay or you dont pay he said the americans proved 
with irangate that they are also willing to deal in the end 
this has gotten to be the hotel business he said france 
paid the bill 
ivor stanbrook another british conservative party legislator 
directed reproach at chirac 
it is a desperate attempt by chirac to save his 
candidacydisgraceful the consequences for all europeans in the 
middle east will now be that much more dangerous and for the 
french they will be dire it is a desperately foolish thing to have 
done he said 
in london prime minister margaret thatcher reaffirmed her 
determination not to pay ransom to the captors of britons missing 
in lebanon we will not in fact pay ransom or make any particular 
payment of that kind in order for the hostages to be released 
she told parliament 
but mitterrands campaign manager pierre beregovoy said the 
hostages were released in conditions that do honor to our 
country 
jeanmarie le pen leader of the extreme rightwing national 
front who ran against mitterrand and chirac in last months 
preliminary presidential election and was eliminated from the 
runoff called the deal a defeat 
there is the other side of this a death and the price that i 
would like to know there is only one way to deal with terrorists 
that used in ouvea 
he was referring to the french police raid on melanesian 
separatists holding hostages in new caledonia fifteen 
hostagetakers were killed and the 23 hostages were freed 
abroad comment ranged from dubious to scathing the influential 
swiss daily tribune de geneve editorialized 
in freeing the hostages tehran raised stakes to the 
maximum what is the price paid by paris very high most 
likelynot counting eventual ransoms denied officially but 
insinuated privately 
reporters watched for a possible release of anis nacache held 
in a french prisoner for the attempted assassination of former 
iranian prime minister shahpour bakhtiar 
french papers offered triumphant headlines but subdued comment 
the normally iconoclastic and widely read daily liberation 
limited itself to a signed comment by marc kravetz its foreign 
editor 
first the joy undiluted joy he wrote adding later 
this liberation is certainly a considerable success for those who 
obtained it success for shadowy diplomacy and bargaining 
forget money paid to kidnappers secondary players in the 
operation iran wanted arms political concessions prisoners 
released we do not know will we ever know what was paid 
joy cannot hide the uneasiness kravetz concluded it is 
as absurd to deny this happiness as it is legitimate to worry over 
the immediate future 
the influential daily le monde published thursday afternoon 
did not mention british criticism and its editorial skirted 
foreign comment but it raised key questions 
what was algerias role why did iranian leaders and shiite 
lebanese who follow them accord to chirac what they refused a 
socialist prime minister two years ago 
and finally the question everyone is asking and no one has 
answered convincingly what was the price

officials at two federal prisons where cuban 
inmates rioted last november failed to secure the facilities partly 
because early signs of trouble were not relayed to them by prison 
personnel according to a justice department report 
officials at the oakdale la and atlanta ga federal prisons 
also had no plans for dealing with institutionwide disturbances 
said the report dated feb 1 but not made available until 
wednesday 
the rioting which lasted for eight days at oakdale and 11 days 
at atlanta included the taking of prison guards as hostages and 
resulted in one death of a detainee and millions of dollars in 
damage to the institutions it was triggered by a state department 
announcement of a pact with cuba that would have led to deportation 
of some of the inmates 
the report said takeovers as complete as those at oakdale and 
atlanta literally were unimagined 
it said oakdale officials ignored warning signs including 
an inmate food fight in the cafeteria and said important 
information was not conveyed to the warden or other officials 
on atlanta the report said warden joseph petrovsky would have 
attempted a lockdown had he received enough reliable information 
that a disturbance was likely it said he was told by his staff 
that atlanta inmates were calm after the oakdale rioting began 
in actuality the report said line staff had overheard 
detainees conversations about hostagetaking received warnings 
from informants and noticed other indications of potential unrest 
thomas boyd assistant attorney general acknowledged in a 
letter accompanying the report that justice department training 
programs dealing with emergency responses and hostage situations 
may be further improved

emerging from seclusion following the 
apparent suicide of his top aide rep roy dyson firmly denied that 
either he or the aide were homosexuals 
the maryland democrat said at a wednesday news conference that 
he thinks tom pappas committed suicide sunday because he believed 
his reputation would be destroyed by a story in the washington post 
the post had reported that pappas imposed unorthodox demands on 
young male staffers requiring them to attend social functions 
asking one to perform a strip tease at a staff retreat and firing 
another for leaving a party 
pappas dysons administrative aide and campaign manager died 
in a fall from the 24th floor of a new york hotel on sunday 
asked the nature of his relationship with the 46yearold 
pappas who had been with him throughout his political career 
dyson said the two were very very good friends 
he was like a brother we had a personal and professional 
relationship dyson said 
dyson was asked if pappas was a homosexual 
no he was not he said 
are you he was asked 
no i am not he replied firmly 
dyson complained that the post story was based on interviews 
with a few disgruntled former staffers and gave only one side of 
the story 
what i would certainly have preferred was that the other side 
be given a chance he said however he admitted that the post 
had asked him for comment on the original story and he had declined 
on the advice of his attorneys 
dyson said he pappas and todd skipper another staff member 
had gone to new york for a longscheduled trip to visit a defense 
contractors plant he said part of the expenses including 
saturday night tickets to the hit musical phantom of the opera 
were paid for by the contractor 
reviewing the hours before pappas died dyson said he talked to 
his aide twice after the post story was read to pappas by a staffer 
in maryland on sunday morning 
the impression i had was that he was very upbeat that we 
could cope with it dyson said but he said pappas also knew 
that his reputation would be ruined 
dyson said he doesnt recall the contents of a note left in the 
room by pappas but that it was not addressed to anyone did not 
mention any names and did not seem like a suicide note to me 
the congressman said he didnt think his chances of winning 
another term will be hurt by publicity surrounding pappas deathhe 
said he has a new chief of staff katie tucker and a new campaign 
chairman christopher robinson and is ready to get back to work 
dyson said pappas made some mistakes but called him a man of 
integrity of compassion

the destruction of a nevada plant that 
makes fuel for the space shuttle could delay production for the 
shuttles booster rocket but nasa says it probably wont delay the 
shuttles next flight 
the explosions wednesday leveled the pacific engineering amp 
production co plant at henderson nev but billie deason a nasa 
spokeswoman in houston said the kerrmcgee plant in henderson 
could provide morton thiokol inc with the oxidizer ammonium 
perchlorate used in the boosters 
the production of both suppliers was planned to support a 
shuttle flight rate of about 24 per year we dont expect supply 
problems she said 
don amitor a spokesman for nasas marshall space flight center 
in huntsville ala said thiokol had enough ammonium perchlorate 
for the next five shuttle launches under the present schedule the 
fifth launch would be in mid1989 
however thiokol spokesman rocky raab said there could be 
performance differences in the oxidizers produced by the two plants 
if the pacific engineering plant is down for an indefinite 
period of time there could be delays in our production raab 
said were looking into our stockpiles to determine how much of 
the material we have 
an oxidizer is needed in the booster rockets to provide an 
oxygen supply so that the rockets fuel can ignite and burn 
raab said the matter is complicated further because government 
specifications for solidfuel rockets are based on which plant 
produces the oxidizer 
whatever supplier made the materials for the motor you qualify 
for thats the supplier youre supposed to use in the kind of 
motor youre making he said 
were determining what motors were designed for the ammonium 
perchlorate we got from pacific engineering we just dont have an 
answer yet on exactly how well be affected 
every solidfuel rocket motor made in the united states has some 
ammonium perchlorate in it and only kerrmcgee and pacific 
engineering produce it thiokol buys material from both plants as 
do other aerospace companies and the department of defense 
the department of defense could step in and claim all the 
production at kerrmcgee raab said 
ted olsen spokesman for rocketmaker hercules inc in magna 
utah said kerrmcgee and pacific engineering also supply hercules 
with oxidizer he said company officials are working to determine 
what impact the plants destruction will have on hercules 
a pentagon official who asked not to be named said it was 
certainly premature to suggest the defense department might 
monopolize production at kerrmcgee 
we do not expect to see any immediate impact the official 
added 
according to the pentagon ammonium perchlorate is used on the 
mx titan and minuteman missiles and would be needed if a decision 
is made to build the midgetman mobile nuclear missile 
the pentagon and armed forces do not contract with pacific 
engineering directly however instead leaving that to three prime 
contractors morton thiokol hercules and aerojet 
the first 50 mx missiles are now being deployed and the accident 
wont affect that work the pentagon added

captain kangaroo is ok for kids but some 
students at western connecticut state university say it could be a 
tad embarrassing to have bob keeshan as commencement speaker 
this is the first time in 35 years i have encountered this 
reaction keeshan said wednesday from his babylon ny home 
i dont know what they expect mr moose and dropping pingpong 
balls i will give them stuff to think about and if they cant be 
open to my message then westconn did not do a good job on them 
supporters note that keeshan 61 has received the peabody award 
for outstanding television three times and six emmy awards among 
other honors 
but joshua p marks a senior wrote in a letter to the school 
newspaper im sure captain kangaroo is a delightful fellow but 
it is of the opinion of many students he offers no insight or 
inspirational impetus for our seniors to attain career pursuits 
rick haught the schools assistant director of student 
activities worked with the senior class in picking keeshan for the 
may 15 ceremonies 
ok ill admit it i love the captain haught wrote in the 
school paper but captain kangaroo is not the person who will be

israeli troops barking orders 
through megaphones demanded a threeday halt to all west bank 
commerce thursday and threatened to weld shut the shops of defiant 
arab merchants 
near the village of beita where an israeli teenager was slain 
last month hundreds of jewish settlers trudged along a mountain 
path waving israeli flags they chanted expel the arabs and 
vowed not to leave the occupied west bank 
in the occupied gaza strip troops fired tear gas at about 150 
children who set tires ablaze and raised the palestinian flag to 
protest the armys closing of arab schools 
israeli troops ordered the ban on west bank commerce to punish 
arab residents for a oneday strike wednesday that was called by 
the palestine liberation organization 
soldiers ordered shops to stay closed until sunday and they 
threatened to weld shut the shops of merchants who disobeyed the 
mandate 
in jericho the army shut down the west banks largest vegetable 
market and stores were ordered shut in nablus jenin tulkarem 
hebron and bethlehem 
in nablus troops erected roadblocks and prevented arab taxis 
and buses from leaving the city to punish residents for adhering to 
wednesdays work stoppage which paralyzed the occupied territories 
businessman saed kenaan of nablus said the army action was aimed 
at creating dissension between palestinians and the underground 
leaders who order the strikes 
its clear the israelis are trying to drive a wedge between 
the people and the leaders kenaan said but people are aware 
of the israeli games 
in gaza city scores of school children chanting plo yes 
israel no hoisted the palestinian flag onto a pole at a school 
run by the united nations relief and works agency an arab reporter 
said the palestinian flag is outlawed in israel 
troops fired tear gas to disperse the children who erected 
barricades of boulders and set tires ablaze in front of the school 
the reporter said 
during a fourhour march thursday about 1000 jewish settlers 
many with rifles slung over their shoulders retraced the route 
taken by teenage hikers when a bloody clash erupted april 6 at the 
arab village of beita a 15yearold israeli girl and two 
palestinians were killed 
we want to finish what we started 30 days ago said menachem 
ilan one of two armed escorts with the hikers last month we 
intend to show people everywhere that the nation of israel can walk 
freely in every part of the land of israel 
im proud to do it again but it feels like a nightmare 
said 15yearold ariel avivi one of 16 teenagers who took part in 
the april hike 
in a report that caused an uproar in israel the army determined 
the slain girl tirza porat was accidentally shot to death by an 
israeli guard accompanying the hikers but jewish settlers have 
accused arabs have causing her death by stoning the hikers 
the girl and a soldier are the only israelis to die since 
palestinians began their fivemonth uprising against israeli rule 
in the occupied lands according to un figures 183 palestinians 
have died in the violence 
on thursday the hikers clapped and sang nationalist songs as 
they trekked along a rocky path that began in the jewish settlement 
of tappuah about five miles south of beita it ended at an army 
base about eight miles away where the settlers held a ceremony in 
the girls honor 
the march did not go through the village of beita or to the dry 
riverbed nearby where the israeli hikers clashed with arab 
villagers organizers of the march said it followed the route the 
hikers intended to take before they were led by the arabs into 
beita 
a military helicopter circled overhead and dozens oftroops 
watched the march from a mountaintop 
we want to show those arabs they cant destroy us and were 
not afraid of them said 15yearold rina efrach from the nearby 
settlement of kadumim of course im afraid personally but we 
cant show that because then they will break us

a supreme court justice today refused to block 
the extradition of a former argentine general charged with 39 
murders in his countrys socalled dirty war against suspected 
subversives in the 1970s 
justice sandra day oconnor by denying an emergency request 
cleared the way for the return of carlos g suarezmason to 
argentina from san francisco where he is in the custody of federal 
marshals 
he had sought to stay in this country while a federal appeals 
court studies his case 
a federal judge and the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
previously had refused to grant suarezmason any emergency help 
assistant us attorney mark zanides who represented the 
argentine government in the case said oconnors action removes 
the last practical barrier to suarezmasons extradition zanides 
said all records in the case are now in the hands of the state 
department which makes the final decision on extraditions 
lawyers for suarezmason have said that if the courts refuse 
emergency intervention they will ask secretary of state george 
shultz to postpone action on an extradition until their appeal of 
last weeks ruling can be heard in full 
suarezmason 64 was a highranking general in argentinas army 
during the reign of a military junta that took power after 
president juan perons death in 1974 
suarezmason commanded one of five military zones the one in 
which the capital city of buenas aires was located 
according to us district judge d lowell jensen the military 
juntas method of dealing with suspected opponents was direct 
abduct anyone they suspected of subversion off the street or out of 
their homes transport them to secret detention centers torture 
them physically psychologically and often sexually and in vast 
numbers kill them 
jensen said more than 12000 people disappeared and were 
presumably killed during the juntas reign which ended in 1983 
the judge said some 5000 people disappeared in the military zone 
commanded by suarezmason 
he faces charges on 39 counts of homicide in argentina 
suarezmason asked oconnor to postpone his extradition which 
he said could be imminent until the 9th circuit court considers a 
formal appeal he has filed with it 
if suarezmason is turned over to argentine officials before 
then his lawyers said his appeal becomes meaningless 
the emergency request said a treaty between the united states 
and argentina forbids extradition for either political or military 
offenses 
suarezmason also has been sued in us courts by survivors of 
the military juntas dirty war 
a federal judge in san francisco recently ordered him to pay 
217 million in damages to horacio martinezbaca an argentine 
lawyer who was imprisoned and tortured for four years in the buenas 
aires area but now lives in oakland calif 
suarezmasons ability to pay any of the judgment against him 
remains a matter of contention 
the case is suarezmason vs robinson a847

three freed french hostages returned to france 
today after three years of captivity in lebanon and premier 
jacques chirac thanked iran for intervening to free the frenchmen 
iran said it intervened for humanitarian reasons chirac 
said normal relations with iran broken july 17 could be 
envisaged 
interior minister charles pasqua told reporters that no money 
was paid to free the hostages and that france did not negotiate 
with the captors but a syrian mediator said france repaid 670 
million in borrowed money to iran and made other compensation to 
the kidnappers 
diplomats marcel carton 62 marcel fontaine 45 and journalist 
jeanpaul kauffmann 44 arrived at the military airport of 
villacoublay in a special government jet they were freed wednesday 
evening in beirut 
its an incredible day kauffmann said looking thin but 
healthy but its also a day which remains overshadowed because 
we are just three 
kauffmann then spoke at length about michel seurat the french 
researcher captured with him who is believed dead kauffmann said 
earlier that seurat said to have been executed by his kidnappers 
probably died of cancer 
im a little ashamed to be here today kauffmann said he 
then recalled western hostages still being held in beirut leading 
that nightmare life 
carton said the three saw other hostages but did not know who 
they were 
chirac in a short address also thanked syrian president hafez 
assad and lebanese military authorities for their help in gaining 
freedom for the hostages who were held by proiranian extremists 
as we all know the liberation of our hostages falls into the 
framework of our relations with iran chirac said its the 
authorities in tehran who intervened with the captors so that they 
free our countrymen he said that france had been awaiting the 
releases for weeks and for months 
irans official tehran television monitored in cyprus quoted 
ali reza moayyeri a deputy prime minister for political affairs 
as saying that iran interceded with the moslem people of 
lebanon on behalf of the hostages 
the broadcast quoted moayyeri as predicting the release would 
lead to the restoration of diplomatic relations with france 
chirac evoking questions about the means by which the hostages 
were freed said the government never ceased to act with dignity 
and honor 
commentators immediately raised the issue of a deal and began 
speculating about what transpired ten french hostages have been 
freed since chiracs government took office in march 1986 
in response to questions from reporters pasqua said we have 
not accorded any funds of any sort to anyone not a franc not a 
dollar not a deutschmark not a yen 
there were no negotiations with the captors he continued 
i think that would have been completely useless 
there were reports in beirut that france agreed to repay irans 
fundamentalist rulers the outstanding twothirds of a 1 billion 
loan made by the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi 
a syrian mediator said in geneva today that france finished 
repaying the loan as part of the deal 
it was paid back in three installments the last one just very 
recently omran adham told the associated press this is my 
information from the french syrians and iranians 
adham a 41yearold syrian businessman undertook several 
mediation missions over the past two years in which he asked assad 
to intervene with iran for the freeing of the hostages 
he said he was certain the french government offered other 
compensation for the kidnappers though he had no proof the 
government expelled adham from france tuesday 
it was not known what effect the release might have on chiracs 
chances in sundays presidential runoff against president francois 
mitterrand the socialist president who is seeking a second 
sevenyear term has been considered the favorite 
the hostages arrived at the airport at 1037 am 437 am 
edt 
cartons wife denise left beirut today to join her husband in 
paris airport sources said she was flying via zurich 
as soon as the detention of our hostages in lebanon ended the 
reestablishment of normal relations between france and iran could 
be envisaged conforming to our concept of what rapport between 
states should be chirac said 
france and iran broke diplomatic relations last summer in a 
dispute over an iranian embassy employee wahid gordji who refused 
to submit to questioning about the series of bombings in paris in 
september 1986 
carton former embassy vice consul in beirut told a reporter 
aboard the plane that he and the other captives saw other 
hostages but we did not know exactly who they were 
seurat a 39yearold academic researcher was kidnapped may 22 
1985 along with kauffmann a magazine reporter with whom he was 
working islamic jihad or holy war claimed it killed him march 5 
1986 his body was not found but his wife said french officials 
confirmed his death 
carton and fontaine an embassy protocol officer in beirut were 
seized by islamic jihad on march 22 1985 
there are still 18 foreigners including nine americans missing 
and believed held hostage in lebanon terry anderson 40 chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press is the longest 
held he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
andersons sister peggy say responding to reports that carton 
had spent time as a hostage with anderson said she was encouraged 
i was very anxious to view the other hostages as they got off 
the plane she said in an interview in batavia ny the very 
fact that they were walking and talking was encouraging to me and 
especially now that i know that mr carton spent time with terry

the reagan administration today charged 
nicaraguas government with systematically undermining peace talks 
by moves that a republican congressman said are designed to hold up 
us humanitarian aid to the contra rebels 
we are very concerned by the systematic moves of the 
sandinista government to undermine the peace process and intimidate 
its political opposition white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said 
fitzwater said actions in the last 72 hours by nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega have once again held his true colors 
high showing that he has little intention of supporting a free 
press of allowing democratic dissent or making the reforms called 
for by the guatemala city peace plan 
meanwhile at a news conference contra political leader adolfo 
calero accused the sandinistas of trying to force the rebels into a 
choice between hunger and surrender 
he said the insurgents refuse to accept that choice and plan to 
continue negotiations with the sandinistas on the basis of the 
temporary cease fire agreement signed six weeks ago 
but he said the rebel forces will not enter the seven cease 
fire zones which have been mutually agreed to if there is no 
assurance of delivery of the aid which has been approved 
the aid of the us government has been held as hostage by the 
sandinista government all this time 
in managua nicaragua spokesmen for opposition parties said 
that police detained more than 25 opposition leaders who had 
gathered to support workers on a hunger strike and held the leaders 
for about two hours 
on tuesday the nicaraguan interior ministry barred the 
privately owned radio mundial and the roman catholic station radio 
catolica from broadcasting news for eight days it also closed 
radio corporacion for 24 hours for airing false news about the 
strike 
fitzwater said this intimidation of the media and political 
opposition can only be a further hindrance to the peace process 
rep william broomfield rmich who met with secretary of 
state george shultz along with other members of the house foreign 
affairs committee said there is a deep concern about the 
situation that is developing in nicaragua 
the sandinistas are stalling on the negotiations and holding 
us aid as hostage broomfield said after an hourlong 
closeddoor meeting with shultz who declined to answer reporters 
questions you could just feel his letdown on this development 
broomfield said a 49 million aid package approved a month ago 
to encourage peace talks between the two warring sides seemed to be 
having the opposite effect the action taken by congress has 
really helped the sandinistas jeopardize the contras he said 
it seems to me the democrat leadership has a responsibility to 
put pressure on the sandinistas to carry out the intent of congress 
and supply humanitarian aid he said 
house speaker jim wright dtexas acknowledged that aid was not 
flowing as congress intended but said the problem seemed to be more 
with state department officials administering the aid than with the 
sandinistas 
wright was scheduled to meet separately later in the day with 
officials of the state departments agency for international 
development and with a group of contra leaders 
were going to sit down with them and find out whats the 
holdup he said but he noted that none of the 10 million 
earmarked to pay expenses of a nicaraguan verification commission 
has been spent thats where the thing may have broken down 
the commission is made up of nicaraguan cardinal miguel obando y 
bravo and joao baena soares secretary general of the organization 
of american states and is to monitor the march 23 ceasefire 
agreement between the two sides 
among the commissions tasks is to inspect cargo destined for 
the contras in the field to ensure there are no weapons included 
and to mediate disagreements over what agency or contractor is to 
deliver the aid 
aid officials have awarded contracts to begin a 177 million 
program of medical care for children on both sides of the conflicts 
who are victims of the nearly sevenyear war and a small amount of 
that money has begun to flow a limited amount of food clothing 
and medicine also has been delivered to contra troops inside the 
honduran border 
negotiations to implement a 60day cease fire agreed to march 23 
in sapoa nicaragua have stalled and the situation has been 
further complicated by a split in contra ranks over negotiating 
strategy and who is to provide military leadership

deputy secretary of state john whitehead will 
hold talks with algerian officials next week regarding their 
governments role in ending the hijacking of a kuwaiti jetliner 
the state department announced thursday 
whitehead will visit algeria tunis and morocco between may 9 
and 15 said spokesman charles redman he will then travel to paris 
for talks with officials there and a meeting of the organization 
for economic cooperation and development an association of the 
major industrial countries 
in his talks in algiers whitehead will ask for information 
regarding the fate of the hijackers and the terms of the deal under 
which they released 31 hostages following their 16day ordeal last 
month 
algeria has been reluctant to disclose details of the case 
contending it must maintain its international credibility as a 
crisis negotiator 
redman said the united states still does not have any indication 
that the hijackers left algeria despite news reports that the 
iranianbacked extremists traveled from algiers to syria and then 
to lebanon 
us officials said last week that kuwait had apparently 
conveyed to the hijackers a promise that it would grant an early 
release to five of the 17 prisoners whose freedom was being sought 
by the hijackers the 17 were convicted in the 1983 bombings of 
us and french facilities in kuwait 
the officials say kuwait which has denied making any deal 
probably does not have any intention of keeping its promise they 
also say syria has firmly denied that the hijackers came there from 
algiers 
secretary of state george p shultz praised algeria for 
mediating the hostages release but criticized it for letting the 
hijackers get away

bishop eugene a marino was greeted with applause 
from priests parishioners and civil rights leaders today as he 
entered a packed auditorium for his installation as the nations 
first black roman catholic archbishop 
the audience at the 4580seat atlantic civic center included 
members of slain civil rights leader martin luther king jrs 
family the mass was also being beamed by closed circuit television 
to overflow crowds at a nearby theater and on local and national 
cable tv networks 
in march pope john paul ii chose the 53yearold cleric to 
become archbishop of atlanta 
the mass was also attended by more than 800 members of the 
clergy including nearly 100 roman catholic bishops and four 
cardinals as well as local officials representatives of local 
catholic congregations and other state religious leaders 
archbishop pio laghi the popes representative in the united 
states was leading the celebration 
claud shirley assistant director of communications for the 
archdiocese recalled that when atlantas last archbishop was 
installed the mass was held at the cathredral of christ the king 
a 50yearold gothic church in the upscale buckhead section of 
atlanta 
scant attention was paid to the installation of archbishop 
thomas a donnellan on july 16 1968 he said marino succeeds 
donnellan who died in october 
shirley said the differences in the two masses are attributed to 
more than marinos status as the first black archbishop in the 
country 
the pope has set the tone for these major events insofar as he 
enjoys seeing and being seen by as many people as possible 
shirley said the trend is towards large public events when it 
is a major event 
marinos installation has been divided into two services one 
wednesday night at christ the king where he presented his 
credentials and was received by the 200 priests in the archdiocese 
marino who spent the last 14 years as auxiliary bishop in 
washington dc said he is comfortable returning to the south 
despite the discrimination he experienced firsthand as a youth in 
his hometown of biloxi miss 
i think that the south has changed and come of age and 
grown he told one interviewer in many ways the race question 
has been more effectively addressed in the south than it has been 
in the north 
marino has been a pioneer for blacks within the us catholic 
church becoming the first black to hold office in the national 
conference of catholic bishops 
but he downplays his role as the churchs spokesman on civil 
rights even though he comes to atlanta the base of many past and 
present civil rights leaders 
he said his appointment presents a great sign of hope to all 
of our people to all of our black catholics and to black people in 
our country 
while in washington marino developed a reputation as an 
advocate for the poor the imprisoned and the homeless frequently 
serving as their spokesman in national and local legislative forums 
in the seven weeks since his appointment marino has kept up 
with developments in the atlanta area according to the rev peter 
dora director of communications for the archdiocese 
among those events was the indictment of a former priest at a 
large suburban church on charges of molesting altar boys 
authorities have said they are investigating whether 
archdiocesan officials knew of the allegations but withheld 
information and one priest at the church was disciplined after he 
blamed celibacy for sexual and behaviorial aberrations among the 
clergy 
marino also will face dissension at the cathedral that will 
serve as his home church 
the cathedral needs repairs and a consultant has recommended 
that renovation include the addition of chapels 
but opponents say the plans will ruin the churchs traditional 
beauty and they claim the proposals have caused people to leave for 
other churches in february the cathedrals administrator the 
rev richard kiernan promised no decision would be made without 
the wisdom and guidance of our next archbishop 
the archdiocese covers 69 counties of north georgia and has a 
catholic population of 156000 out of a total population of 37 
million about 200 priests are in the archdiocese

i dont remember ever having an argument said mrs stahly 
who was valedictorian we always saw eyetoeye on things 
their class originally had 16 members but by the time they were 
seniors all but elsie and louise had left school and the entire 
student body had dwindled to nine the school in danvers 
population 920 closed in 1967 
at last weeks reunion in mrs stahlys apartment the two 
talked fondly of their other friends at school and how the boys and 
girls each had secret societies and there was the war effort 
for which they remembered knitting white string washcloths 
those were the days mrs stahly said the two knew many in 
the war but said they could not recall any of their classmates 
leaving school for the war effort 
their graduation ceremony included a formal baccalaureate 
service despite its size 
we had the works mrs stahly said we had a real 
program 
although there were no caps and gowns a speaker came from 
springfield the girls chose a motto only a commencement 
and their colors were khaki because of the war and rose 
announcements went out and the girls decked out in their white 
graduation dresses were handed diplomas rolled in their class 
colors 
all at once it came to me mrs stahly said this is the 
end of high school this is the end i thought i was going to cry 
up there on stage 
mrs gaddis also was caught up in the emotion of the ceremony 
it was sentimental she said 
however their friendship was far from over both taught school 
after graduation and married farmers the same year their first 
babies were the same age and graduated together from danvers high 
now both are widows and live in apartments in bloomington 
about 10 miles east of danvers theyve celebrated about six 
reunions although last year they simply spoke on the telephone 
im so thankful were together yet mrs stahly said 
were figuring on hanging in there for our 80th reunion

a city commissioner has withdrawn a 
resolution calling for a week of official mourning for benjamin 
linder the former portland resident shot to death by nicaraguan 
rebels 
commissioner mike lindberg withdrew the resolution at 
wednesdays city council meeting which about three dozen people 
many wearing badges reading no honor for treason attended 
lindberg later said he withdrew the resolution because he didnt 
want the hearing to become a forum for a debate over us policy in 
central america 
i was afraid that what was supposed to be a simple memorial 
would end up being hurtful and damaging to the family he said 
opponents of the resolution said they were prepared to speak 
about linder at the hearing said mike wiley of the oregon 
citizens alliance in my opinion benjamin linder was a traitor 
hes not a hero or martyr hes a traitor wiley said 
linder 27 was killed in an attack by the usbacked rebels 
known as contras on april 28 1987 while he was working on a 
hydroelectric project in rural nicaragua relatives have traveled 
around the nation during the past year to speak out against us 
military involvement in nicaragua 
last year the city council unanimously approved a resolution 
honoring linder and opposing further us aid to the contras that 
resolution introduced by lindberg drew little opposition because 
of the lack of opposition last year lindberg said he hadnt 
expected a fight this time

advocacy groups asked monsanto corp to take 
lasso the nations most popular herbicide off the market thursday 
because of its cancercausing potential the company refused 
in a letter to monsantos chairman delivered to the companys 
washington office the groups asked that the company honor previous 
pledges not to sell unsafe products by recognizing the 
unacceptable risks posed by lasso 
though the names of 58 organizations were attached to the 
letter many were state or local affiliates of four groups whose 
staffs passed out leaflets or addressed a sidewalk rally six floors 
below clean water action project national coalition against the 
misuse of pesticides public interest research group and public 
citizen 
upstairs robert harness vice president for environmental 
affairs told reporters monsanto has absolutely no intention of 
pulling lasso from the market we are very proud of the product 
lasso is the trade name for alachlor a herbicide used widely 
for weed control on corn soybeans and peanuts more than 80 
million pounds are used each year 
after three years of special study the environmental protection 
agency in december decided to allow continued sale of alachlor but 
restricted use to statecertified applicators 
alachlor causes tumors in laboratory animals and epa classifies 
it as a probable cause of cancer in humans 
epa has required monsanto to undertake new studies of 
groundwater into which it says alachlor can leach the herbicide 
has been found in groundwater in 11 states 
an earlier monsanto study found alachlor in 4 percent of 246 
wells in the cornbelt in concentrations ranging from 02 to 22 
parts per billion epa said it believed a lifetime of drinking 
water contaminated at 1 ppb would increase the chance of cancer in 
humans by four in a million at most 
harness said monsanto does not believe alachlor can leach into 
groundwater and when it has been found there generally speaking 
thats been tied back to an improper well or a spill and thats 
sopmething that can be corrected 
outside rick hind of public interest research group noted that 
du pont co is supporting the withdrawal of ozonedestroying 
chemicals and said our last hope is the good will of companies 
like monsanto since federal pesticide law requires epa to permit 
sale of chemicals whose benefits outweigh the risks of use 
kevin thorpe an entomologist on the staff of the national 
coalition against the misuse of pesticides said epas riskbenefit 
calculation was flawed because it did not consider nonchemical 
weed control

two of three redesigned joints on the 
space shuttle booster rocket passed their first qualifying tests 
with flying colors morton thiokol inc engineers said thursday 
engineers have inspected both the aft and center joints between 
segments of the solid fuel booster and found both worked as 
designed during an april 22 fullscale testfiring dave mobley 
nasa deputy project manager for the redesign effort said 
results of tests on the forward joint are expected friday 
the center joint held up even though an intentional flaw was 
built into it for the testfiring at the morton thiokol plant 25 
miles west of here 
two more fullscale qualifying tests of the booster are planned 
for june and july and the shuttle is tentatively set for launch in 
late august or early september the first since challenger exploded 
on jan 28 1986 
mobley said the center joint flaw allowed superhot gases from 
the burning fuel to reach insulation and the joints oring gasket 
but the ring held 
there was no damage to the oring at all he said there 
was no evidence the gas got past the ring 
failure of an oring seal is blamed for allowing exhaust gas to 
escape from one of challengers boosters a presidential commission 
found the gas ignited the shuttles exterior liquid fuel tank 
triggering the explosion that destroyed challenger and killed its 
seven crew members 
mobley also said engineers found no damage to the rockets 
nozzle section in a december testfiring a nasadesigned boot 
ring on the section came apart the april test used a morton 
thiokoldesigned boot ring that was reliable in the past 
a final report based on more extensive study isnt expected 
for several weeks he said

the state department on thursday marked the 
conclusion of a twoday israeli raid into lebanon by equally 
condemning all parties to crossborder violence and declining to 
accept jerusalems explanation that the drive was aimed at 
terrorists 
we wont try to characterize this particular operation one way 
or the other department spokesman charles e redman said after 
issuing a statement that lent no support to israeli claims that the 
raid was retaliatory 
for more than a decade the statement said a long series of 
crossborder violence has left death and destruction in southern 
lebanon and northern israel 
theyre tragic and inevitably set back prospects for 
achieving security and stability in the area redman said 
during the raid at least 40 arabs were killed along with three 
israeli soldiers the israeli army said 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said israel would not hesitate to 
conduct more raids in its security zone in southern lebanon to 
purge it there is nothing worse than allowing terror elements 
who are active against us to establish themselves freely and feel 
free to act against israeli and targets in the security zone he 
said 
rabin said the proiranian hezbollah or party of god shiite 
moslem movement was singled out by the israeli forces because it 
has become one of the elements that most cooperates with 
palestine liberation organization chairman yasser arafat 
the state department however said security should be pursued 
through agreedon arrangements between israel and lebanon that 
could provide security for the peoples of southern lebanon and 
northern israel who deserve it 
redman also called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from 
lebanon as the only way to achieve security and stability in 
the region 
he apparently referred both to syria which plays a dominant 
role in lebanon and whose army controls large areas of the country 
and israel which periodically sends forces into a belt along the 
border manned by proisraeli lebanese soldiers

israelibacked lebanese militiamen blew up 
dozens of homes in a southern lebanon village thursday in the final 
stage of an assault by israeli troops against arab guerrillas 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said more similar raids by the 
militiamen could be expected 
israeli television said the south lebanon army destroyed about 
60 houses in the village of maydoun which israeli officials said 
was used as a base by the radical shiite moslem militia hezbollah 
or party of god 
israeli troops seized about 20 suspected guerrillas and brought 
them back to israel during the twoday thrust into lebanon that 
ended wednesday israeli sources said on condition of anonymity 
israel said at least 40 guerrillas were killed in the operation 
most of them hezbollah members killed wednesday in maydoun two 
miles north of israels selfproclaimed security zone in southern 
lebanon 
two of the three israeli soldiers killed in the assault were 
buried thursday 
sheik subhi tofeili a hezbollah leader said only 10 of his 
guerrillas were killed he also said the hezbollah would avenge the 
attack 
we shall retaliate the battle with israel is still in its 
initial stage he told a news conference in mashgara four miles 
north of maydoun the torch of resistance will continue to burn 
despite israels attacks 
lebanon protested the raid and requested an urgent meeting of 
the un security council to condemn the operation un officials 
said the 15member council likely would meet friday 
lebanese ambassador rachid fakhoury in a letter made public 
thursday said the lebanese government holds israel the security 
council and the united nations responsible for this fresh act of 
aggression 
according to lebanese reports israeli soldiers blew up homes 
and bunkers in maydoun after the fighting ended and used bulldozers 
to bury the rubble and the bodies of the dead guerrillas 
israel radio and television reported that south lebanon army 
returned thursday to destroy more homes apparently almost all that 
remained after the attack 
israeli officials said the missions aim was to halt escalating 
guerrilla attacks against israel soldiers and their christian 
allies 
our activity cannot only be defensive rabin said on 
israel radio from time to time we must initiate action against 
the terrorist bases that operate against us 
the security zone a 6to10 mile wide strip north of the 
israeli border was designated as a buffer zone after israel ended 
its threeyear occupation of south lebanon in june 1985 
israel will have to keep up its offensive operations the 
daily haaretz quoted maj gen yossi peled commander of israeli 
forces in the north as saying if you dont take the offensive 
you may save some lives in the short run but six or seven months 
later the number of casualties could be inestimably higher 
haaretz quoted unnamed military officials as saying israel would 
forfeit its success at maydoun unless it continued to take the 
initiative in its war with the guerrillas 
martin kramer a specialist on the hezbollah at tel aviv 
university said the shiite fundamentalist organization is israels 
implacable enemy 
they want to destroy israel kramer said on israel radio 
but some critics questioned the wisdom of the attack on maydoun 
noting that the hezbollah had not taken part in any of the dozen 
infiltration attempts by guerrilla groups since november 
why hezbollah asked military analyst uzi mahanaimi in a 
frontpage commentary in the yediot ahronot daily hezbollah is 
not the israeli armys main enemy in south lebanon and hasnt tried 
to penetrate into northern israel

hostages

liberated and according to the latest reports they returned to 
france moayyeri said

art and artists still connected to cuba have split 
the cuban exile community along generational lines as it struggles 
to find a balance between anticommunism and artistic freedom 
seventeen older directors and five top officials resigned from 
the cuban museum of arts and culture following a tumultuous 
emergency meeting wednesday night 24 hours after a pipe bomb blew 
out the empty buildings front door 
the resignation of the mostly older directors in their 50s and 
60s left the museum in the hands of younger less militant cubans 
older anticastro activists make no pretense of objectivity 
they say the museum has lost touch with the community it serves and 
the trauma suffered by cubans oppressed and sometimes imprisoned in 
the homeland and now separated from their families 
this is a museum of exiles said founder raul alvarez one 
of the directors who resigned this is not a museum in new york 
or little rock 
the resignations were triggered by their failure to oust two 
museum vice presidents who defended an auction that included 
paintings by artists still living in cuba 
many directors also wanted an upcoming exhibit by cuban painter 
amalia palaez canceled because they felt she is too close to cuban 
leader fidel castro 
exhibit curator giulio blanco said the chaos following the 
resignations may accomplish that goal 
pseudopatriotic hysterics are responsible for all this he 
said theyve made total fools of themselves and all of miami 
the remaining directors most in their 40s drafted a statement 
that energetically denounced the pipe bombing and vowed to 
guarantee respect for diversity of views 
the museum reaffirms its unswerving commitment to freedom and 
democracy and repudiates totalitarianism which has so made our 
people suffer they said 
wednesdays showdown followed increasingly bitter complaints 
about the april 22 art auction phone threats to the museum and 
slashed tires followed the event and culminated in the pipe bomb 
blast tuesday night 
no organization claimed responsibility for the attack but 
similar bombings have plagued other miamiarea facilities that have 
had dealings with cuba 
ramon cernuda one of the two vice presidents who refused the 
boards request to resign accused the directors of caving in to 
fear 
the issues are no longer censorship and intolerance said 
cernuda the issues are intimidation and terrorism 
a majority of the boards 54 members attended wednesdays 
meeting at which museum president nunzio mainieri offered his 
resignation saying im not up to the pressure anymore 
the president invited all the musuem officers including 
auctiondefenders cernuda and teresa saldise to join him all went 
along except cernuda and ms saldise 
the directors then voted 1916 to request their resignations as 
well again cernudca and ms saldise refused and 17 directors 
stalked out

a chicago advertising agency has turned the 
heartache over the baltimore orioles losing ways this season into 
a case of heartburn 
a fullpage newspaper ad with a picture of an orioles jersey a 
bottle of peptobismol and the words the one that coats is the 
only one you need started appearing tuesday in some large 
newspapers including papers in new york chicago and los angeles

beating the chicago white sox 90 friday 
everyone recognizes the situation that the team has been 
facing problems winning games said linda ulrey a spokeswoman

the ad also helps to lighten a tense situation she said 
thursday 
the orioles supported the concept created by the chicagobased 
leo burnett of usa advertising firm 
robert aylward the orioles vice president of business affairs 
said the team agreed to allow pampg to run the ad with the orioles 
jersey if it doesnt make a mockery of the team and it doesnt 
i think when people pick up the paper and see the ad they get 
a little smile on their face its obviously tongueincheek 
people laugh aylward said

the white house said thursday it deplored 
polands use of violence to squelch the latest outbreak of labor 
strikes and suggested the polish government seek a dialogue 
with the solidarity labor movement 
taking note of reports that polish police on wednesday used 
percussion grenades against strikers to end a 10dayold walkout at 
a krakow steel mill white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the administration was watching with concern 
it was the second such statement in as many days on wednesday 
president reagan said he hoped the government of gen wojciech 
jaruzelski will hear the voice of the polish people and that 
economic reform and recovery will soon begin 
in thursdays statement fitzwater said we deplore the 
reported actions of last night and we strongly urge the government 
of poland to begin a productive dialogue with all segments of 
polish society including solidarity the outlawed polish labor 
union movement he added 
such a dialogue would inspire confidence in economic reform in 
poland and in the countrys future any resort to repressive 
measures and particularly the use of force against peaceful 
demonstrators can only have the reverse effect fitzwater said 
the strikes that have swept across poland since april 25 amount 
to the most serious since the imposition of martial law and the 
1981 military crackdown on solidarity 
the problems in poland can only be resolved by the poles 
themselves and they can only be resolved with wisdom and foresight 
on the part of those in positions of authority fitzwater said 
we hope and pray that the polish government will hear the voice 
of the polish people 
asked if the statements reference to solutions being found by 
the poles themselves amounted to a warning against soviet 
interference in its warsaw pact allys affairs fitzwater said 
this is a matter best defined by dialogue between the polish 
government and the various elements that are involved in poland 
outside influences from whatever source are not always the best 
the spokesman said it was a helpful sign that the catholic 
church was attempting to mediate 
asked if the administration was concerned the unrest might 
affect the summit later this month between president reagan and 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev fitzwater said he did not 
expect it to present seriously detrimental effects but that it 
could come up for discussion 
the spokesman was asked if any more strongarm tactics by the 
polish government could trigger a new round of us sanctions or 
affect the countrys relations with such organizations as the 
internatinal monetary fund 
the united states imposed economic sanctions against poland 
after the imposition of martial law and attempts to repress 
solidarity 
i dont want to make any threats fitzwater said we 
simply point out there could be detrimental effects in terms of the 
reform process and we would urge them to be aware of those effects 
and hope that they dont happen 
an east german leader on a trip to washington meanwhile urged 
both superpowers to avoid interference in polish affairs

lawmakers on thursday lambasted the defense 
and state departments for allowing americandesigned rifles built 
in south korea to be sold to foreign interests despite a 
uskorean agreement forbidding such sales 
democrats and republicans on the house armed services 
investigations subcommittee charged that us officials ignored 
repeated warnings and evidence of illegal korean sales of m16 
rifles 
the warnings came from colt industries inc the hartford 
conn maker of the m16 
our government continued to sleep at the switch through 
repeated warnings from industry said rep larry j hopkins rky 
the hearing focused on a general accounting office investigation 
that said the 1971 uskorean agreement which banned sales to 
third countries without us permission and placed a limit on the 
number of m16s korea could build was violated on both counts 
gao associate director joseph e kelley said many of the 
problems stemmed from uncertainty over which government agency 
should have been in charge of the program in large part kelly 
said oversight of the program was left to colt which was a 
partner in the 1971 pact 
paul g gubbins a former assistant counsel at colt said the 
company repeatedly presented us officials with documented 
evidence of attempted sales of rifles and parts and several 
completed sales to indonesia through intermediaries but that 
produced little more than perfunctory inquiries 
in every instance when colt approached the government it 
received a polite hearing gubbins said 
in some instances there was a perfunctory inquiry or polite 
admonition to korea on more than one occasion government 
representatives wished us well in our efforts to resolve the matter 
privately but never was there any serious or meaningful effort 
to stop what was obviously happening 
in 1983 colt asked edwin meese iii the attorney general who 
then was counsel to president reagan that the m16 problem be 
brought up by the president during a planned trip to korea the 
request was rejected colt said 
glenn a rudd deputy director of the defense security 
assistance agency said the defense department for better or for 
worse treated the rifle program and the developing problems 
largely as a commercial matter 
colt sued the korean government after the company stopped 
receiving royalties of 7 per rifle that occurred in 1982 when 
korea turned over operation and ownership to a private company 
daewoo precision industries of a government operated armsmaking 
plant colt had helped build 
colt officials told lawmakers they never wanted to get into the 
program noting that they would have made much more money if they 
built the rifles at their connecticut plants and sold them to korea 
but the nixon administration wanted to give the south koreans 
weaponsproducing capabilities to keep it competitive with north 
korea 
gubbins said thendeputy defense secretary david packard 
personally lobbied for the proposal and colt eventually acceded 
to the wishes of its own best customer the pentagon buys about 
80 percent of the m16s colt manufacturers 
rep bill nichols dala chairman of the subcommittee has 
asked gao to investigate other weaponsmaking agreements the united 
states has with korea and other nations

two teams reached the summit of mount 
everest from opposite sides thursday and broadcast stunning 
pictures of azure skies and the craggy snowcovered himalayas 
rising above the clouds at the top of the world 
it was the first time two parties had scaled the worlds highest 
mountain simultaneously and it was the first live telecast from 
the summit 
the 10 climbers wept and congratulated each other some fell to 
their knees after wading through waistdeep snow to the 29028foot 
peak 
they were from japan china and nepal the nations that received 
the live broadcast 
this is the greatest event in the history of climbing said 
kunga sherpa the leader of the team that climbed from the nepal 
side as a camera recorded the breathtaking panorama 
images were relayed by satellite from a small camera attached to 
the helmet of japanese climber susumu nakamura 
we made it the climbers gasped their voices rasping in the 
thin air most wore goggles and oxygen masks along with their red 
blue and yellow parkas eyebrows were coated with ice in 
temperatures of about 30 degrees below zero 
they stretched brightcolored banners across the summit and 
scooped dry powdery snow into small bottles one poured whisky on 
the snow to honor mountaineers who have died trying to conquer 
everest including hidetaka mizukoshi he died of a heart attack on 
a climb last month 
the teams began their assaults on everest last month from base 
camps on the south face in nepal and the north face in tibet 
after the rendezvous in another first three climbers who 
scaled the south face descended by the north and three who ascended 
the north face went down via the south 
more than 200 people were involved in the project the most ever 
for an everest expedition 
it was timed to mark the 35th anniversary of the first 
conquering of everest on may 29 1953 by edmund hillary of new 
zealand and tenzing norgay his sherpa guide nearly 200 climbers 
have reached the summit since then some more than once 
sir edmund who was knighted for his feat could not be reached 
for comment thursday earlier this week he said of the simultaneous 
assaults i think some of the expeditions nowadays are on the 
gimmicky side but conceded that its one method of raising 
money 
the ones i admire are those who do a tough and difficult new 
route and do it cleanly and with style he said 
hillary now is his countrys ambassador to india nepal and 
bangladesh tenzing called tiger of the snows by other 
sherpas died in 1985 
nihon television corp of japan which paid most of the 
expeditions cost of 125 million arranged the telecasts all 
three countries received several hours of broadcasts thursday 
including footage of the ascents and descents 
thursdays telecasts were the first in which the nepalese had 
seen the top of their famous mountain 
many elderly people in the kingdom which was nearly closed to 
the outside world until 1950 have thought foreigners scaled the 
great peak seeking jewels and other treasure 
but i saw them today said ram jung thapa 74 they were 
just gathering and putting samples of ice in their bottles i now 
realize they go there in an adventurous spirit 
mathura man amatya who walked two days in 1953 to meet hillary 
and tenzing said the mountain was never so near as we have seen 
today until now we have only heard the story from the 
climbers

elliott trueluck is a familiar figure 
here a disabled veteran who used to sing to a pack of dogs that 
followed him on his daily walk to a coffee shop but he says hes 
afraid to walk downtown since a police officer opened fire on his 
followers 
it scared the idontknowwhat out of me said the 
61yearold trueluck i did what that boy police officer told 
me to do and got out of there what if he had turned the gun on me 
instead of the dogs 
the april 29 shooting which killed at least two dogs including 
one of truelucks own has angered residents who watched the little 
band pass by each day for years while defending the officer city 
officials also promised an investigation and charges have been 
filed by a judge 
ive walked right by them on the sidewalk and all they did 
was wag their tails said judy thompson who witnessed the 
shooting its bad to think you live in a town where the cops 
just pull up and go to shooting 
harriett dixon director of the okefenokee humane society in 
nearby waycross said police sgt james mock killed up to eight 
dogs some were killed by shotgun blasts while wounded dogs were 
then beaten to death with a billy club she said 
mock has refused to discuss the incident but mayor harry adams 
said the officer shot two dogs on orders from city hall adams said 
trueluck had laughed off warnings that the dogs presence violated 
the city leash law 
warrants issued by a probate judge charged mock with cruelty to 
animals and he is free on 500 bond the judge issued the 
warrants which allege that at least four dogs were injured or 
killed after hearing statements from the humane society and a 
witness 
several residents of this community of 3500 said dogs that 
followed trueluck each morning posed no threat 
we watched him every day said one resident rebecca 
jacobson he had different dogs with him every day hed walk and 
they would follow him if one of them strayed hed sing 
mrs jacobson said she was working in a drugstore when she heard 
shots and ran outside 
he was out there beating them with a stick she said 
there was one injured dog that was trying to get away hed run a 
little and sit down we could tell hed been shot in the back 
a town ordinance requires that dogs be on leashes when out of 
their owners yards but several people who work at the shopping 
center said unleashed dogs belonging to prominent white citizens 
roam the centers parking lot while their owners are inside 
ignored by police trueluck is black 
police chief dennis martin said he has asked the georgia bureau 
of investigation to conduct an independent inquiry to determine if 
any of the states anticruelty statutes had been violated 
but he added my officers havent done anything wrong 
truelucks wife myrtice said he receives a small monthly 
disability check because he never recovered from shell shock 
suffered during world war ii 
he aint been right since they shot the dogs she added 
hes got bad nerves 
a symptom of truelucks condition is that he laughs at just 
about everything during a recent interview he chortled constantly 
while recalling his fear during the shooting but he confirmed that 
he had been warned 
they had warned me that if i brought them back again theyd 
put me and the dogs in jail said trueluck 
now that he has stopped walking to town trueluck sometimes sits 
on the steps of his cinderblock home talking to nobody a black 
labrador retriever that escaped the gunfire and clubbing

a bodybuilder accused of beating a 
hitchhiker to death and tying his body between two poles was insane 
at the time of the murder because he was taking anabolic steroids 
his lawyer says 
attorney richard lubin will rely upon a defense of 
steroidinduced insanity during the trial of horace ace 
williams according to documents he filed with the court the trial 
is scheduled to begin monday 
anabolic steroids synthetic versions of the male hormone 
testosterone are used by some athletes and weightlifters to 
stimulate the production of proteins that increase muscle size and 
strength 
but the drugs which are available legally only by prescription 
are also blamed for making users more aggressive 
lubin said wednesday that williams 23 had taken the drug 
orally and by injection for months before the crime 
the combination of the steroids and beer he drank that night 
caused williams to lose his ability to understand or reason 
accurately lubin said 
in an effort to prove the steroids made williams insane lubin 
said he would offer the testimony of two experts doctors from duke 
and harvard universities 
williams 23 was charged with firstdegree murder in the sept 
6 1986 death of michael shane patterson police said williams and 
his weightlifting buddy william whitmore also charged with 
murder picked up patterson on a state highway 
they drove patterson to a remote field owned by williams 
father police said 
williams a high school dropout told officers he and whitmore 
21 were bored nothing to do so we figured were going to have 
fun with this guy according to police reports 
but williams told police he and whitmore never intended to kill 
we werent out to do this guy any major injustice you know 
williams told police we were all pretty buzzed and just laughing 
and were not nowhere near murderers 
police never asked williams if he had been using steroids but 
whitmore told police williams had been taking the drug 
there williams and whitmore allegedly beat patterson with a 
pipe and heavy pieces of wood cut hair from his head and 
underarms rammed pattersons body with a car and then hogtied him 
between two poles 
pattersons naked body was found the next morning 
in an article in the april issue of the amereican journal of 
psychiatry researchers said steroid abuse by athletes could lead 
to severe depression manic behavior and other serious mental 
problems

a national aids hot line is trying to hire 
more operators to deal with the calls expected after an educational 
pamphlet on the fatal disease is mailed to every household in the 
country officials said 
this is a pretty important subject and is hitting people in a 
personal way said carol humphries 43 coordinator for the 
national aids hotline operated in the research triangle park 
the american social health association operator of the 
tollfree hot line under a contract with the us centers for 
disease control will expand its staff by 50 percent over the next 
few weeks to handle the expected increase in calls she said 
the pamphlet understanding aids is being mailed to 110 
million homes by the federal government and should appear in 
mailboxes beginning may 26 surgeon general c everett koop 
announced wednesday 
humphries said the mailings have forced some highpowered 
recruiting of operators through advertisements and flyers this 
week humphries said the hot line had 130 operators fielding calls 
here but she hopes to recruit an additional 120 by the end of the 
month 
the 24hour hot line 1800342aids has had its headquarters 
in durham county since october the health association also 
operates a bank of phones in new york city 
some 200000 people called in april bringing the total for the 
past year to more than 1 million calls the number of calls is 
expected to double in 1988 
the hot line operation also is working with telephone companies 
to add 12 phone lines to the 32 already in use 
we heard about the mailout in march and started to plan for 
it this is not something you do overnight its taken quite a 
while to put things together humphries said this is pretty 
high tech when you get right down to it

mexicans watched the deadline for amnesty 
under the new us immigration law pass on thursday but didnt 
expect the measure would stop the flow of jobseekers crossing the 
border 
carlos salinas de gortari the governing partys candidate in 
july 6 presidential elections said the new law cannot defeat the 
economic reality that is experienced in the united states where 
mexican workers continue being needed 
he said however that extra steps must be taken to make sure 
workers human and labor rights are protected on both sides of the 
border and to increase employment opportunities in mexicos 
northern states 
salinas de gortari said in a campaign speech wednesday in 
morelos state southwest of the capital that some in the united 
states might try to take advantage of mexican workers after the law 
takes effect 
the concern that i have is that with the deadline passed 
this law might be invoked as a prextet to abuse mexican migrant 
workers he said we also must increase effort vigilance and 
attention for our countrymen who might return from the united 
states so that they might not be abused or exploited by mexican 
authorities on our territory 
salinas de gortari is the candidate of the institutional 
revolutionary party which has not lost a presidential race since 
its inception in 1929 it is almost certain he will defeat five 
minority candidates and be inaugurated to a sixyear term 
succeeding president miguel de la madrid on dec 1 
the speech dominated front pages thursday in local newspapers 
the newspapers gave ample attention to developments in the united 
states where 107 immigration offices closed their doors to the 
onetime offer of amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants 
rosario ibarra de piedra presidential candidate of the tiny 
revolutionary workers party said the mexican government must bear 
responsibility for workers need to go to the united states in 
search of jobs because of difficult economic conditions here 
the minimum daily wage in mexico is 8000 pesos or about 350 
she said the government doesnt defend the undocumented 
workers and accused the united states of giving dollars to mexico 
in exchange for cheap labor 
the government newspaper el nacional said in an editorial that 
no law alone can solve economic problems of any country 
it said that despite the law the united states still will 
require the labor the vigor of mexican workers who at extremely 
convenient prices for american employers made possible the 
economic flourishing of that country along with millions of other 
immigrants 
many here see the traffic across the border as part of 
centuriesold patterns that date back to when the american 
southwest belonged to mexico 
although some mexicans have said they returned because of the 
new law in the united states no statistical studies have been 
completed since the start of the period for amnesty began fears 
that the new law would lead to mass deportations of mexican workers 
in the united states appear to have largely abated 
others believe the impact of the new law will not be fully seen 
until after june 1 when companies employing illegal aliens could 
be fined 
hilda patricia neira a researcher at the colegio de la frontera 
norte in the border city of tijuana said the law will likely fuel 
a black market in false documents 
tijuana mayor federico valdes martinez told reporters there is 
space available there for any mexicans who might return at least 
on an emergency basis

preliminary studies have found that human saliva 
contains a factor that blocks the aids virus from infecting cells 
indicating the body may have a natural defense against the deadly 
disease researchers said thursday 
isolating and understanding the inhibitory element in saliva may 
help researchers learn how to naturally prevent transmission of the 
virus said philip fox head of clinical studies at the national 
institute of dental research and senior investigator in the study 
the significance is that its a demonstration of a natural 
defense that people have against the aids virus fox said in a 
telephone interview from the national institutes of health in 
bethesda md 
a report on the study appears in the may issue of the 
chicagobased journal of the american dental association 
the research also provides a biological explanation of why the 
mouth isnt a transmission route for the disease fox said thats 
good news for dentists and others concerned about catching aids 
through contact with the saliva of infected people 
this supports biologically what we have been seeing 
epidemiologically said irwin mandel director of the center for 
clinical research in dentistry at columbia university in new york 
there is essentially no chance of transmission of the virus 
through saliva 
fears about kissing contact with eating implements and so on 
could be dispelled by this kind of evidence said enid neidle an 
assistant director of the american dental association 
fox and four coworkers collected saliva samples from the mouths 
of three healthy men and secretions directly from their major 
salivary glands 
none of the three was at risk for acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome which destroys the bodys defenses against disease and 
leaves a person prey to lifethreatening infections and certain 
cancers 
the samples were mixed with the virus that causes aids and 
lymphocytes immune system cells that are the major targets of the 
virus 
the virus wasnt able to infect the lymphocytes in the saliva or 
the secretions from the submandibular and sublingual glands at the 
bottom of the mouth the researchers found 
however in two of the men lymphocytes in secretions from the 
parotid salivary gland near the ear were infected secretions from 
the parotid gland of the third man were not infected 
the researchers arent certain how the inhibitory element works 
but fox said it may interfere with the surface receptors though 
which white blood cells are infected by the aids virus 
the researchers are expanding their work to include women 
children and people infected with aids fox said 
the latest study expands on research done two years ago in which 
scientists found that the aids virus was neutralized by saliva from 
humans and chimpanzees fox said at the time researchers didnt 
know whether the neutralizing agent was a product of the salivary 
glands or one of the other elements of saliva such as blood 
components bacteria or cells 
the new study shows that the neutralizing element is a product 
of the submandibular and sublingual glands mandel said 
theoretically the study results could lead to the discovery of 
a natural immunization against aids mandel said 
researchers now must isolate the neutralizing element in saliva 
find out how it works and then learn how to activate it in the body 
as a defense against aids said mandel a pioneer in the study of 
saliva as a protective factor against disease 
the aids virus is spread most often through sexual contact the 
sharing of comtaminated syringes shared by drug abusers infected 
blood or blood products and from pregnant women to their offspring 
more than 60000 cases of aids and 34088 aids deaths have been 
reported in the united states from june 1981 through may 2 
according to the national centers for disease control in atlanta

ethiopias main ally bombed the town april 8 killing at least 50 
people 
wukro was an important fooddistribution center until the army 
withdrew from much of tigre and eritrea after rebel offensives in 
march western and government relief organizations also operated 
droughtaid stations in aksum and adigrat 
aksum 340 miles north of addis ababa was the capital of a

crop failures in eritrea and tigre have left an estimated 32 
million people in the two provinces threatened with starvation a 
huge relief operation has been hamstrung by the governments 
military priorities in the region 
western relief officials fear 2 million people are beyond the 
reach of the aid network because of the government withdrawal and 
its expulsion of foreign aid workers from the north

convention while jackson has 927 according to the associated 
press delegate count 
sen albert gore jr even though he has suspended his campaign 
still has 45 super delegates in his 419 delegate total sen paul 
simon who also has suspended campaigning has 285 super delegates 
among his 1845 gore has won 17 percent of the primary popular 
vote and simon under 6 pervent 
while campaigning in nebraska on thursday jackson complained 
that dukakis has an inflated padded lead caused by the super 
delegates he said he would be contacting them with appeals to 
fairness asking that they make their votes correspond to the 
popular vote in the presidential campaign 
earlier in the week jackson objected that the popular vote for 
the nomination is not directly reflected in the number of delegates 
each candidate wins 
there must be some reasonable correlation between the popular 
vote and the delegate count in a democracy he said were not 
talking about generosity were talking about reciprocity 
however tad devine who oversees delegate selection for the 
dukakis campaign said the super delegates have been following 
popular will 
a lot of this campaigns success in recent weeks with super 
delegates is directly related to its success with voters devine 
said in a telephone interview from boston

democrat michael dukakis said thursday he wants a vice president 
who speaks up and speaks out in a gibe at republican george 
bushs explanation for staying silent at cabinet meetings jesse 
jackson said dukakis delegate lead was disproportionately 
inflated padded by party leaders and elected officials 
jackson said he will make appeals for fairness to the 643 
democratic super delegates to follow the lead of voters in 
their districts 
there must be some reasonable correlation between the popular 
vote and the delegate count in a democracy jackson told 
reporters in kearney neb 
in the 29 primaries held to date dukakis received 67 million 
votes or 37 percent of the total while jackson got 51 million or 
28 percent 
in the associated press delegate count dukakis has 1500 of the 
2081 delegates needed for a convention majority while jackson has 
927 dukakis total included 166 socalled super delegates while 
jacksons total included 46 
jackson scheduled quick campaign stops in nebraska and then new 
mexico before heading to california where bush spent the day 
california offers a delegate treasure trove 314 democratic and 
175 republican bigger than all the other remaining state contests 
combined next up are west virginia and nebraska primaries on 
tuesday with a total of 62 delegates at stake 
bush told reporters in sacramento on wednesday that he sometimes 
keeps silent at cabinet meetings 
i hold back speaking in meetings because i dont want the 
president to have to be choosing between his vice president and the 
other members of the cabinet and i hold back sometimes because i 
worry about leaks he said 
bush spokesman stephen hart told reporters the next morning that 
bush reserves his advice for the president 
hart said bushs reserve at cabinet meetings has enabled him 
to have a uniquely individual relationship with the president 
hes been a very effective vice president due in part to that 
unique relationship he has had with the president for the past 7 
years 
dukakis campaigning in the coal country of west virginia said 
he liked his lively contentious cabinet in massachusetts 
thats the way you get good giveandtake i hope ill 
have a vice president who speaks up and speaks out said the 
governor 
dukakis also took a swipe at bushs repeated statements that he 
wants to be known as the education president 
the next president must be this nations no 1 advocate for 
educational opportunity and good schools not just during election 
years but every day and every week and every month he said 
bush was asked at a high school in a mexicanamerican 
neighborhood in los angeles about the prospects for federal help to 
pay college tuition he replied there would be a changing of 
priorities to some degree as part of his plan to stress education 
but he went on to say there has to be a limitation on what 
the federal government can do 
dukakis also released federal tax returns that showed the 
governor and his wife kitty had joint income of 108957 last 
year and paid 25892 in federal taxes

the conservativedominated california 
supreme court refused thursday to let the legislature cut medical 
payments for abortions for poor women a stinging defeat for 
antiabortion groups 
it is the 10th straight year that state courts have overturned 
the legislatures budget restrictions which would have eliminated 
state funding for all but a small fraction of medical abortions 
antiabortion groups hoped for a change this year because it 
was the first time the issue had been considered by a court with a 
52 majority of gov george deukmejian appointees the republican 
governor backed the restrictions on abortion funding and was 
prominent in the 1986 campaign that defeated the courts previous 
liberal majority led by chief justice rose bird 
only chief justice malcolm lucas and justice edward panelli 
voted to grant a hearing on the appeal by deukmejians 
administration of a lowercourt order requiring full funding of 
abortions to continue four votes are needed for a hearing by the 
sevenmember court 
it means that over 80000 poor women in california are going 
to continue to have the right to abortion and that the legislature 
cant restrict their reproductive choices to only childbirth and 
sterilization said martha kegel associate director of the 
american civil liberties union of northern california 
to the extent that the righttolife movement was hoping that 
a mere change in the composition of the california supreme court 
was going to mean the overturning of established precedent theyre 
dead wrong 
the 198889 state budget similar to every budget since 1978 
would have allowed statefunded abortions in only a few types of 
cases if childbirth would endanger the womans life if the 
pregnancy resulted from rape or incest reported to authorities if 
the woman was under 18 and had notified her parents of the 
abortion or if the fetus was severely deformed 
the budget set aside 1286 million for abortions and said no 
other funds would be allowed abortionrights groups said 
unrestricted funding would cost 25 million but that the 
restrictions would eliminate about 90 percent of all medical 
abortions 
the budget restrictions have never taken effect because of 
orders by state courts 
in 1981 the state supreme court ruled that as long as medical 
paid for childbirth the restrictions on abortion funding violated 
a poor womans right of privacy under the state constitution to 
decide whether to give birth 
that ruling conflicted with a us supreme court decision under 
lessprotective privacy standards of the us constitution 
allowing states to limit abortion funding california is one of 
only 14 states that has continued to pay for poor womens abortions 
since the federal government cut off most funding in 1977 
the san franciscobased 1st district court of appeal ruled feb 
19 that the abortion restrictions were invalid on two grounds a 
violation of the right to privacy as defined by the 1981 state 
supreme court decision and a violation of the state constitutional 
rule that a new law cannot cover multiple subjects 
because the medical law requires funding for all 
childbirthrelated medical services including abortions the 
budget restrictions conflict with that law and should have been 
contained in a separate bill rather than attached to the budget 
the appeals court said

soviet and us veterans of the cold war on 
thursday proposed that their nations stop intervening in the third 
world as a step toward reducing tension but they differed over the 
use of cuban forces abroad and agreed to overlook the 1981 
crackdown in poland 
the proposal was presented in a working paper that one 
coauthor arthur macy cox said could have been subtitled no 
more afghanistans no more vietnams 
cox a former cia official organized the 3year effort to 
produce the paper along with georgi arbatov who is an adviser to 
kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev and head of moscows usacanada 
institute 
we believe that military intervention by the superpowers in 
regional conflicts has reached a dangerous dead end and should be 
terminated by mutual agreements said the paper which was 
produced by seven soviets affiliated with official news 
organizations and research institutes and seven american former 
officials and scholars 
the paper also touched on areas that already are under 
negotiation such as sharp cuts in strategic nuclear and 
conventional arms strict controls on chemical weapons and 
adherence to the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty which would 
doom president reagans strategic defense initiative 
the new ground lay in the area of intervention in the third 
world a topic believed to be under hot debate in the kremlin 
following the decision to withdraw the red army from afghanistan by 
early next year 
the problem of defining limits to such intervention became 
evident during a news conference thursday as cox and arbatov 
professing harmony could not agree whether the use of 45000 
prosoviet cuban troops in angola constituted proxy forces the 
paper calls for a ban on such forces 
the us government calls cuban forces used in third world 
conflicts soviet proxies 
they are not our proxy forces arbatov said this is 
simply a friendly nation that has its forces on the invitation of 
the angolan government in angola i cannot regard them as our proxy 
forces 
cox interjected let me say that we do regard them as proxy 
forces and it is spelled out in here in the position paper 
so i hope we cannot have any mistaken conclusions 
on another area of eastwest tension the working paper listed 
the soviet invasions of hungary in 1956 and czechoslovakia in 1968 
as direct intervention but did not mention the martial law 
crackdown which crushed polands solidarity trade union in 1981 
the subject was not raised during the lengthy discussion that 
preceded release of the paper cox said there was no 
intervention by the red army or by other proxies into the affairs 
of poland 
the reagan administration had a radically different 
interpretation at the time of the crackdown thensecretary of 
defense caspar w weinberger described polish leader gen wojciech 
jaruzelski as a russian in a polish uniform 
and ryszard kuklinski a polish colonel who helped draft plans 
for the military crackdown and later defected to the west has said 
the soviets were involved in preparations for martial law and 
relentlessly pressured jaruzelski threatening to invade if the 
polish army did not suppress solidarity 
arbatov is a member of the policymaking communist party central 
committee and several other soviets on the panel are regarded as 
advisers to gorbachev 
soviet participants in the paper included fyodor burlatsky a 
prominent journalist valentin falin head of the semiofficial 
novosti news agency vitaly zhurkin head of a newly created 
institute on european affairs and several of arabatovs aides 
sergei plekhanov henry trofimenko and andrei kortunov 
the americans who contributed to the position paper were all 
members of the american committee on ussoviet relations and 
included besides cox townsend hoopes undersecretary of the air 
force under president johnson william colby a former cia 
director george ball former undersecretary of state john culver 
a former us senator william miller formerly head of the senate 
intelligence committee staff and adele simmons president of 
hampshire college in massachusetts

rep hal daub turned up the temperature 
thursday in the increasingly bitter republican primary for us 
senate criticizing incumbent david karnes as a rubber stamp 
for president reagan and gov kay orr 
karnes called the charge crazy but said he would not be 
drawn into negative campaign tactics before tuesdays election his 
top media aide brent bahler called daubs comments the rhetoric 
of a desperate candidate who knows hes lost the nomination 
mrs orr said it was sad that daub feels he has to take a 
desperate approach 
the race for the gop nomination is considered too close to call 
an omaha worldherald poll last week showed karnes backed by 41 
percent of those interviewed while daub was supported by 40 
percent nineteen percent were undecided and the margin of error 
was 4 percentage points 
the gop candidate likely will face former gov bob kerrey who 
has only token opposition in the democratic primary 
karnes was appointed by mrs orr to replace sen edward 
zorinsky a democrat who died in march 1987 
daub a fourterm congressman has mounted an aggressive 
campaign some party regulars have described him as a pit bull 
the latest assault by daub came as the candidates first daub 
then karnes appeared before 300 people at the nebraska life 
underwriters convention 
i havent been a rubber stamp for anybody daub said ive 
been independent of my governor and my president when i believe it 
to be in the best interest of nebraskans 
daub said karnes flipflopped on many votes to please 
reagan including last years highway bill that raised the speed 
limit to 65 mph 
david karnes first voted for the highway bill but then 
changed his vote when the president and the governor told him to 
he said when the trade bill came up i knew all along it was 
antiagriculture but david karnes voted for it until the president 
told him to change his vote 
karnes made no reference to daubs comments in his thursday 
speech to the underwriters 
were going to be positive for the rest of the campaign 
karnes said in an interview later if he daub wants to 
rubberstamp around the rest of the campaign thats fine 
daub was among the party regulars lobbying for the senate seat 
when mrs orr appointed karnes a political unknown who helped the 
governor in her 1986 election 
daub said mrs orr and political outsiders were working to 
reelect karnes against the wishes of nebraskans 
the governor and a small group of people in the republican 
party with a narrow view are trying to control the process the 
process of electing our next united states senator daub said in 
his speech 
i believe nebraska voters with our proud history of 
independent thinking will reject this control of the process by a 
few 
mrs orr was in meetings in omaha on thursday and could not 
immediately be reached for comment on daubs statements 
daub asked in a interview if he was trying to distance himself 
from the reagan administration said 
im trying to differentiate myself from my opponent and the 
approach we will take to speak for nebraskans in the us senate 
when the president is right ive supported him 
bahler said daubs comments were absolutely nonsense he 
said karnes had voted against reagan on several issues and he 
certainly has not been an arm of the governor 
reagan has been a popular figure in nebraska piling up huge 
margins of victory in both 1980 and 1984 in this traditionally 
republican farm state

george bush says he sometimes keeps quiet in 
cabinet meetings for fear of leaks or of forcing president reagan 
to choose between him and other officials but an aide said 
thursday that doesnt mean bush avoids giving reagan his opinions 
he reserves his advice for the president said bush 
spokesman stephen hart 
the vice president on a threeday campaign swing through the 
west told reporters in sacramento on wednesday i hold back 
speaking in meetings because i dont want the president to have to 
be choosing between his vice president and the other members of the 
cabinet and i hold back sometimes because i worry about leaks 
on thursday bush focused on the issue of education sitting in 
on a calculus class at james a garfield high school taught by 
jaime escalante who has earned a national reputation for his work 
in teaching advanced math concepts to disadvantaged students 
one student asked bush about possible problems class members 
might have in paying for college expenses in light of reductions in 
some federal educational loan programs 
bush said that if elected there would be a changing of 
priorities to some degree to reflect more emphasis on education 
in his administration 
but he added there has to be a limitation to what the federal 
government can do 
bush who has stressed education in his campaign drew scoffs 
from the class and the teacher when he asked if they used 
calculators or other machines 
im sorry mr vice president no calculators said 
escalante who was recently honored at a white house reception 
the day before talking of white house meetings and the 
possibility that private discussions would become public bush 
said generally speaking i dont like kissandtell books 
that was an apparent reference to muchpublicized books written by 
former white house spokesman larry speakes and former chief of 
staff donald regan 
if you think somebody is there writing a book putting his or 
her own spin on it you hold back bush said adding that concern 
about such a possibility inhibits freedom of expression in the 
white house 
hart denied that bushs comments on his reluctance to speak out 
reflected any meekness on the part of the man who has a lock on the 
gop presidential nomination 
some people may think hes ineffective but its only the way 
he operates hart said 
its been long established that the vice president does not 
give his advice in cabinet meetings hart added rather he 
reserves that for private meetings his weekly lunches with the 
president and morning staff meetings 
asked if bush had been afraid of speaking in front of former 
chief of staff regan hart said i cant point to any specific 
person who would cause him to worry about leaks 
in his own book looking forward published last september 
bush said reagans cabinet meetings were the only chance for many 
cabinet officials to communicate directly with the president 
knowing this i saw the vice presidents role at these 
sessions as limited bush wrote with open direct access to 
the oval office there was ample opportunity to weigh in with my 
opinion on administration policy without cutting into cabinet time 
or putting the president in a position of having to decide for or 
against his vice president 
in the past bush has not blamed concern about leaks or books as 
a reason for his reluctance to speak out 
bushs reserve at cabinet meetings has enabled him to have a 
uniquely individual relationship with the president hart said

the main defendant in the trial of 25 
officials indicted in a major financial scandal said thursday he 
was the victim of a power struggle and demanded that the case be 
moved to another yugoslav republic 
fikret abdic 49 director general of the agrokomerc 
foodprocessing plant went on trial before the high court of this 
bosnian town on charges of circulating uncovered promissory notes 
worth about 1 billion in the nations biggest postwar financial 
scandal 
both abdic who claimed that the bihac court was biased and 
most of the 25 defense attorneys challenged the courts ability to 
stage an impartial trial bihac is near velika kladusa where the 
agrokomerc company is headquartered 
court president rifat konjic head of a fivejudge panel 
adjourned the trial until monday to consider the defenses demands 
abdic also demanded that the national premier branko mikulic 
and raif dizdarevic who takes over the rotating federal presidency 
this month appear before the court 
the main charge against the defendants is the criminal offense 
of counterrevolutionary threat to the social system which 
carries a maximum of 20 years in prison 
the 25 officials also were indicted for abuse of authority to 
undermine the economy under especially grave circumstances 
embezzlement illegal dealings with foreign companies and attempts 
to disrupt yugoslavias banking and financial system 
abdic spoke of an an unprecedented struggle for power on the 
backs of 13000 people and the back of fikret abdic 
his statement was a reference to agrokomercs 13000 workers 
four thousand have quit since the financial scandal surrounding the 
firm was exposed by the statesupervised media last august about 
9000 are still on the payroll with minimum wages 
abdic and the attorneys contended that by expelling abdic from 
the communist party and denouncing other agrokomerc officials 
party leaders the staterun media and officials in bosnia have 
prejudiced the republics judiciary and made any trial in the 
republic unfair 
abdic himself demanded the trial be held in ljubljana capital 
of slovenia zagreb capital of croatia or novi sad capital of 
vojvodina province 
asked about prospects for a transfer of the trial kresimir abel 
of zagreb abdics chief attorney said with a smile the 
question is superfluous suggesting this would not happen 
other defendants include ibrahim mujic deputy chief of the 
foodprocessing enterprise alija alesevic the director of the 
agrokomerc bank and bankers ismeta junuzovic and mujo vukovic 
the circumstances have forced agrokomerc to engage in such 
business practices abdic told the court about the largescale 
issuance of bad bills of exchange 
he requested that the causes the essence and the 
consequences of the scandal be established rather than his 
personal guilt 
demanding the appearance in court of top leaders abdic made a 
fleeting reference to an alleged comment mikulic made april 30 
1987 to the head of a sarajevo company that it will all be 
settled in connection with uncovered promissory notes 
mikulic and other senior leaders have denied any guilt in the 
affair which was first reported by the belgrade daily borba last 
august 
abdic also sought to implicate the bosnian police and their 
chief dusan zgojanin we cannot influence a lot but we can 
influence some and assist you abdic claimed he was told by 
police investigators when he was asked to testify against hakija 
pozderac 
pozderac now a 69yearold pensioner is the second most 
important defendant and a former economics minister 
his brother hamdija pozderac died in april after resigning as 
federal vice president following allegations he was involved in the

the head of nasa contended thursday that the 
countrys civilian space program is facing extinction this year 
if congress carries out threats to cut space funds 
the outlook is grim said dr james c fletcher 
the proposed space station he said will be doomed if congress 
doesnt grant the money that the national aeronautics and space 
administration and president reagan have requested 
if there isnt enough money we just cant go on he said 
its curtains for the space station if congress appropriates 
much below the 900 million nasa needs 
fletcher carried his fight for funding to a symposium on science 
education saying the space programs future rides on the outcome 
of current budget deliberations in congress 
reagan has proposed 115 billion for nasa in the fiscal year 
that begins oct 1 but members of the senate and house 
appropriations committees have said the amount will be 107 
billion or less 
it may come as a surprise to you but the nations civil space 
program is facing extinction this year fletcher said while i 
remain optimistic about the launch of the space shuttle this 
summer i believe americans must know that the longterm future of 
the space program hangs in the balance this year 
fletcher said that if the amount set in the house budget 
resolution 102 billion prevails the civil space program will 
be stopped in its tracks 
originally nasa wanted 18 billion in 1989 for the station a 
manned facility designed for 30 years of scientific research and as 
a platform for exploration of outer space the president cut that 
request down to 967 million in the budget he submitted to congress 
fletcher would not say how much below a funding level of 900 
million would cause him to kill the station program but he told 
the educators that budget levels being discussed would spell 
death 
the result would be he said that major commitments to the 
stations international partners would have to be cancelled 
advanced astronomy observatories designed to be serviced from the 
station would never get off the ground and scientific research 
wont take place 
the shuttle program on which so much attention is focused 
today will be able to operate only at a reduced flight rate in the 
years ahead fletcher said that would mean he added that 
scientific and national security payloads would have to wait longer 
and the country would fall further behind while the soviet union 
japan and europeans move ahead 
i speak out today because the crisis is real fletcher said 
if the united states the richest nation on earth cannot afford 
to invest a fraction of 1 percent of its budget in its future then 
clearly it cannot afford to be a world competitor in space or on 
earth

the amnesty program that pulled in more than 
16 million aliens seeking to live legally in the united states 
wont be extended and has proceeded very successfully despite 
not hitting the 2 million mark the nations top immigration 
official said thursday 
well take our 85percent batting average on that as quite 
good immigration and naturalization service commissioner alan 
nelson told a news conference he said ins officials had been 
making a rough estimate a year ago when they predicted the 
program would attract 2 million undocumented residents 
he said the oneyear amnesty application period which ended at 
midnight wednesday would not be prolonged even in the face of two 
court rulings he said the courts have both been extremely narrow 
in their holdings 
a federal appeals court in manhattan extended the midnight 
deadline for aliens with children born in the united states who are 
receiving welfare benefits a federal judge in washington extended 
the midnight deadline for a broader group those aliens who 
overstayed their visas 
hispanic groups say some 100000 aliens could be eligible under 
that ruling but nelson questioned the figure 
the numbers we believe are very small and theres also a 
lot of question as to what the rulings are the ins commissioner 
said 
no one should read these court decisions as any indication 
that theyre going to be extensions here other than there might be 
some very narrow ones nelson added 
but charles kamasaki director of policy analysis for the 
national council of la raza a hispanic advocacy group said it was 
possible there could be a crazy quilt pattern of judicial 
extensions for the amnesty program which congress refused to 
extend last week 
kamasaki pointed to classaction cases in federal courts in 
california one involving people who were out of the country for 
extended periods after 1982 and the other for people who left the 
united states briefly after the amnesty program began and returned 
in addition he said there have been 15 changes in the ins 
regulations since the amnesty program went in effect last may 
i hope nelson will reconsider his position on simply resisting 
firm and then reluctantly complying with these court decisions 
kamasaki said 
the ins did a good job but they fell short said mario 
moreno legal counsel for the mexicanamerican legal defense and 
educational fund 
immigration officials could have done a better job on public 
information campaigns in the early months of the amnesty 
application period moreno said he estimated there were 600000 
to 800000 illegal aliens who would have qualified for amnesty but 
who did not apply 
nelson however said no one knows how many illegal aliens there 
are who might qualify who didnt apply he said the ins program 
succeeded in the face of heavy criticism 
the socalled fear factor in which people were believed to be 
afraid to submit applications directly to ins never 
materialized nelson said 
he said more than 80 percent of amnesty applications came 
directly to ins offices without the involvement of lawyers or other 
agencies 
many illegal aliens may have a trust and an appreciation for 
this country and this government beyond that of many citizens 
nelson said 
the amnesty program is part of the 1986 immigration reform and 
control act which was designed to stem the flow of illegal aliens 
across the nations borders under the amnesty portion of the law 
aliens who came to this country prior to jan 1 1982 and have 
lived here since then may apply for legalization 
following optimistic predictions by the ins of a heavy flow of 
applications turnout at many offices was light but there was a 
lastminute crush of requests under the program and on wednesday 
the final day of the program the ins received some 125000 
applications 
according to the ins california had the most applicants with 
55 percent of the total while texas had more than 17 percent and 
illinois nearly 7 percent new york was fourth with 59 percent and 
florida was fifth with 29 percent arizona was sixth with 17 
percent new jersey was seventh with 13 percent and new mexico was 
eighth with 11 percent 
more than 70 percent of the applicants were from mexico 8 
percent were from el salvador and less than 3 percent were from 
guatemala 
the median age of applicants was 30 years old and nearly 80 
percent of those applying were between the ages of 15 and 44 
there is a separate program for agricultural workers who may 
continue to apply for legalization the applications under the 
agricultural program have totaled 479500 to date

prime minister lynden o pindling 
attacked allegations that he accepted bribes from drug traffickers 
as absolutely untrue and said his government will stand up for 
its sovereign rights 
we will take our case to the world we are citizens of the 
world and we have a right to be heard pindling told a rally 
wednesday night at a government schoolhouse 
earlier pindling released a statement denouncing the 
allegations against him made in testimony during the us drug 
trial of reputed colombian cocaine kingpin carlos lehder rivas and 
news reports in the united states that federal grand juries are 
investigating him 
pindling who led the archipelago of 700 islands and 225000 
people to independence after defeating the whiteminority 
government in 1967 was overwhelmingly reelected last year in the 
aftermath of a 1984 royal commission of inquiry that studied 
corruption in the bahamian government and law enforcement the 
probe stopped short of linking pindling directly to drug bribes 
pindling said in his statement he wasnt surprised by the 
allegations that have been made at lehders trial but would be 
surprised if any of the grand juries reportedly investigating his 
affairs indicted him 
this is so because the testimony given concerning me is 
totally and absolutely untrue pindling said i have never been 
offered a bribe and have never accepted a bribe 
for any grand jury anywhere to produce indictments of the kind 
speculated about in the press i would regard as a gross miscarriage 
of justice and a serious breach of faith on the part of the us 
government his statement said 
several prosecution witnesses testified at lehders trial in 
jacksonville fla that pindling took money from smugglers such as 
lehder who allegedly used normans cay in the bahamas as a key 
transfer point for colombian cocaine bound for florida and georgia 
us drug officials have estimated some 40 percent of all south 
american cocaine reaches the united states from bahamian transfer 
points

two members of the student senate at winona 
state university have apologized to a black group for defacing and 
writing insults on a magazine cover picture of jesse jackson a 
school official said thursday 
jon kosidowski administrative assistant to the vice president 
of student affairs at the school said an investigation by the 
schools affirmative action office concluded the two students were 
not motivated by racism but that what was written on the picture 
was derogatory and insensitive 
kosidowski refused to identify the students and others involved 
in the matter also have refused to identify them he said the 
students will remain in the student senate 
the two students wrote individual letters of apology to the 
black cultural awareness association which had filed a complaint 
of harassment and discrimination with the schools affirmative 
action office last month the association is a multiracial group 
with about 25 active members 
the university about 120 miles southeast of minneapolis has 
6400 students about 96 percent of them white kosidowski said 
members of the student senate found the jackson picture from 
the april 13 cover of time magazine on a desk used by several 
people in the senate office senators and school officials who 
investigated the incident said the magazine did not appear to have 
been left for everyone to see it was taken to the school 
newspaper shown to black leaders and published 
the democratic presidential candidates face was disfigured 
horns were on his head and an arrow was drawn through it several 
disparaging slogans were written on the picture 
of the slogans some were racially neutral insults others 
included lets go get whitey and wheres those hymies the 
second was an apparent reference to jacksons offtherecord 
comment made public amid a storm or controversy during the 1984 
campaign referring to jews as hymies the bca also had 
demanded apologies from those responsible and it also sought their 
resignations from the senate 
but a bca spokeswoman said wednesday that the group has accepted 
the apologies and would no longer seek resignations were 
satisfied with everything so far bca president dena gosha said 
of the written apologies 
gosha a sophomore from chicago said the schools 
administration has been very fair about it especially president 
thomas stark he took us seriously that meant a lot to me and 
gave me a little more faith in this school 
at times we feel we dont belong here but the way this has 
been handled makes me proud that i go here gosha said she 
referred to complaints by some black students about racist remarks 
directed at them by some white students 
we definitely agree it magazine defacing was not done with 
racial motivation kosidowski said but he conceded there are 
complaints by black students that they are the targets of racial 
slurs by some white students on campus

the department of education on thursday called 
for new curbs on federal aid for college including mandatory 
credit checks on borrowers 21 or older a ban on assistance for 
high school dropouts and penalties for institutions that fail to 
educate their students 
the reagan administration has proposed some of these changes to 
congress previously and it has not yet lined up any sponsors for 
this new package of legislative proposals 
however bruce carnes the departments deputy undersecretary 
said that with defaults costing taxpayers a horrendous 16 
billion a year support is growing on capitol hill for cracking 
down on defaulters and schools that are eager to sign up 
prospective students but remiss at educating them 
secretary of education william j bennett stirred a controversy 
last fall by proposing to bar colleges or trade schools from the 
student aid programs if their students default rates exceeded 20 
percent 
bennett also has proposed stricter accreditation rules for 
colleges the department is still drafting such rules to be 
presented to congress 
in a statement bennett said thursday his new proposals would 
restore credibility and integrity to the 9 billion student aid 
programs by cracking down on defaults and closing loopholes that 
allow some schools to exploit illprepared often disdvantaged 
students 
both the house and senate are expected to act later this year on 
proposals to attack the loan default problem the lawmakers are 
considered less likely however to take up some of bennetts other 
proposals such as his call for college accountability plans 
bennett asked congress to require institutions to submit 
accountability plans to qualify for college workstudy and 
supplemental educational opportunity grant funds 
each college would have to develop a plan to assess in 
quantifiable terms its success in providing an education of 
demonstrable value to its students according to bennetts draft 
legislation 
we wont specify particular outcome measures the schools will 
do that but i expect they will include such things as performance 
on standardized tests dropout rates and job placement rates 
bennett said its high time in student aid to begin to 
reward success and penalize failure 
he also asked for repeal of a provision in the law that allows 
institutions to admit students without a high school diploma or 
equivalency degree if they are deemed to have the ability to 
benefit from the training 
too often these students are enticed into postsecondary 
institutions by promises of grants and loans only to end up 
dropping out and in debt bennett said 
among his proposals are 
mandatory credit checks on borrowers 21 and older and 
cosigners for those with poor credit histories lenders would be 
allowed to charge up to 25 for the credit checks 
requiring borrowers to give the school their drivers license 
number postgraduation address nextofkin address and other 
information when they leave school 
limiting pell grants to three years for students in programs 
lasting two years or less 
reducing the guarantee on loans from 100 percent to 90 percent 
for banks and even lower for student loan guarantee agencies 
strengthening the secretary of educations powers to suspend a 
school from participating in the aid programs when federal funds 
are at risk

thursday for michael s dukakis to step aside as governor while he 
pursues the democratic presidential nomination dukakis through a 
spokesman refused 
citing a major mess in state government the republican 
officials demanded that dukakis take an unpaid leave of absence 
but stopped short of calling for his resignation 
the call for dukakis to step aside came from state republican 
party chairman ray shamie state sen david locke who is a 
massachusetts election cochairman for republican vice president 
george bush and house minority leader steven pierce 
dukakis was reelected governor in november 1986 with nearly 70 
percent of the vote he has said he will not resign unless and 
until he is sworn in as president his press secretary james 
dorsey said thursday dukakis will not step aside 
we are persuaded that this is partisan tomfoolery and a 
somewhat befuddled attempt by the republican leadership to 
demonstrate that it has a sense of humor dorsey said 
dukakis was campaigning in nebraska and west virginia on

east germanys top foreign policymaker ended 
talks in washington on thursday with a call for broader trade and 
cultural relations with the united states but us officials said 
little progress was made toward settling major differences 
hermann axen a politbureau member and the highestranking east 
german to visit washington since the country was established after 
world war ii told a national press club audience we favor a 
broadening and stabilization of the political dialogue btween our 
governments an expansion of contacts between our parliaments 
the conclusion of a mutually advantageous trade agreement is 
important 
axen said that though the two countries have had diplomatic 
relations for 14 years real contacts are still at the 
beginning 
this fact is especially striking when one looks at the dynamic 
and continuous development of the german democratic republics 
interaction with the overwhelming majority of states in the 
world he said we have to catch up in our mutual 
relationship 
of the soviet unions allies east germany traditionally has 
been among those most willing to follow moscows lead on foreign 
economic and human rights policies 
as a result until the rise of soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev relations between the united states and east germany 
were icy in large part due to us unwillingness to expand 
relations with a country considered to have one of the worst human 
rights records in europe 
relations remain cool as evidenced by a bilateral trade of 
only 150 million last year but on the diplomatic level there 
have been some signs of thaw deputy secretary of state john c 
whitehead visited east berlin last year and secretary of state 
george p shultz met with axen on tuesday 
a us official speaking on condition of anonymity said shultz 
raised the issue of individual freedoms which according to the 
state departments latest human rights report are tightly 
restricted in east germany 
the official said the east germans continue to seek an increase 
in trade but there is no inclination on the part of the united 
states to grant special commercial privileges including most 
favored nation status it has given to hungary poland and 
romania 
the two countries also remain aprt on the settlement of us 
claims against east germany for seizure of american property during 
and after world war ii the claims total more than 78 million 
axen acknowledged that differences remain but said it is our 
belief that trustful dialogue and constructive bilateral ties can 
positively contribute to the betterment of the international 
situation 
his appeal included a personal note axen a jew who joined the 
communist party in the early 1930s was imprisoned in the nazi 
concentration camp buchenwald which was liberated when us army 
troops under general george s patton approached in april 1945 
on my first visit to your country i feel i owe a debt of 
gratitude to the great american people he told the press club

a panel of stockbrokers told a house 
subcommittee thursday that last octobers financial crash and the 
prevalance of program trading is frightening the average american 
away from the stock market 
the brokers told members of the house telecommunications and 
finance subcommittee that the dramatic price swings that have 
characterized trading in recent months and computerdriven 
transactions by huge institutions are making the public reluctant 
to invest in stocks 
the confidence level of the average investor in the stock 
market is today appreciably below any level that i have seen in 
almost 20 years in this business said george strum senior vice 
president of legg mason and co a baltimore brokerage firm 
strum said most of his clients are middleclass investors with 
portfolios that are in some cases worth less than 1000 yet have 
continued investing through tough economic times in the past 
however these same clients today are pulling back from making 
any investments in any equities fundamentally because they are 
worried that the market seems to go up and down very quickly and 
very substantially without any rhyme or reason he said 
they are absolutely disspirited over volatility in the market 
and look now at the market with almost disdain said richard j 
heckmann a senior vice president for prudential bache securities 
in rancho mirage calif 
the subcommittee has been examining the nations financial 
markets since the record 508point drop of the dow jones industrial 
average last oct 19 and the wildly surging prices that have 
become common ever since the panel has yet to propose any 
legislation 
a number of federal agencies and financial market organizations 
also have studied the crashs reverberations and several have 
concluded that a variety of programtrading strategies large 
transactions driven by computers have diminished stability in the 
markets 
some of the studies and several market participants have 
produced figures showing that heavy program trading has at times 
shoved the market downward despite an absence of bad economic 
news computer trading techniques such as index arbitrage are 
instead driven by price differences between the stock markets and 
the stock index futures and options markets 
our equity markets exist for the purpose of capital formation 
and to provide investment vehicles for our people said rep 
edward markey dmass the subcommittees chairman when they 
become playgrounds for computer traders arenas where a very few 
large institutions and investment banks can engineer nearly risk 
free profits while scaring the individual investor out of the 
market something must be done

the navy is going to take another week to 
decide whether to challenge the court ruling that freed dr donal 
m billig from prison officials said thursday 
billig the former chief heart surgeon at the bethesda md 
naval hospital was convicted two years ago at court martial of 
killing patients through surgical negligence 
on april 13 the us navymarine corps court of military review 
struck down that conviction and ordered billig freed from fort 
leavenworth kan concluding the evidence against him was simply 
not sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt 
lt brian cullin a navy spokesman said thursday the navy had 
decided to forego its legal right to ask the same court to rehear 
arguments in the case the navy had until wednesday to file such an 
appeal 
cullin declined to offer a reason for the navys decision but 
another official who asked not to be named noted the navymarine 
corps court had heard billigs case en banc or with all 
members participating and thus was unlikely to change its mind 
by foregoing the right to appeal the matter with that court the 
navy now has until may 13 to appeal the case to a higher court the 
us court of military appeals cullin said 
right now no decision has been made on an appeal the 
spokesman added but we are still within the time limit to 
request such a review 
the decision on whether to challenge the billig ruling will be 
made by the navys judge advocate general and navy secretary 
william ball cullin said 
according to the spokesman billig who holds the rank of 
commander is still in the service he has been assigned to the 
kansas city kan navymarine corps reserve center pending the 
next decision in his case 
billig 57 was the former chief heart surgeon at the navys 
flagship hospital he was convicted in early 1986 on charges of 
involuntary manslaughter and negligence in the deaths of three 
patients and subsequently sentenced on march 3 1986 to four 
years in prison last summer he was rebuffed in his first bid for 
parole 
billigs case attracted great public attention in part because 
of the sensational nature of some of the charges it also prompted 
congressional reviews of military health care in general and 
several large monetary settlements between the government and 
relatives of billigs patients 
prosecutors described billig as an egocentric man nearly blind 
in one eye who hid his visual handicap and continued performing 
complex heart operations despite numerous warnings that he was 
killing patients 
the appeals court concluded last month however the prosecution 
never really produced any evidence or testimony to demonstrate that 
billigs surgical technique and conduct in the operating room were 
so out of line as to constitute criminal conduct

a monthold 13state federal quarantine to 
curb the spread of tiny bee mites is being canceled because it has 
proved to be unworkable the agriculture department said thursday 
the states are florida illinois maine michigan mississippi 
nebraska new york ohio pennsylvania south carolina south 
dakota washington and wisconsin 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said the restrictions are being 
lifted effective friday on the movement of bees and equipment 
from those states 
although not known to be harmful to other creatures the mites 
are considered a major threat to the nations honey and beekeeping 
industry 
the tiny killer mites varroa jacobsoni were first discovered 
in the united states last september in a wisconsin apiary they 
since have spread to the other states 
the varroa mite is an external parasite of adult bees and their 
developing larvae or brood it causes decreased brood deformed 
bees and a weakening of the colonys ability to pollinate plants 
and produce honey infestation can occur so gradually that the 
mites may not be noticed until severe damage is done 
information received from state governments beekeepers 
growers and researchers has caused us to conclude that the 
regulatory program established under the quarantine is not the 
appropriate mechanism to contain the interstate spread of varroa 
mites glosser said 
the original purpose of the quarantines was to issue permits for 
outofstate movement of only bees and equipment found to be free 
of the mites 
however weve found that the requirements under the 
quarantine are not uniformly appropriate or workable because the 
role of honeybees in the agricultural economy varies widely from 
state to state glosser said many beekeepers have found it 
impossible to comply with the regulations and still meet their own 
deadlines 
for example he said a beehive might have to be moved out of 
its home state several times a year treating a hive against mites 
requires 21 days which is longer than most beehives are scheduled 
to stay in a state when they are moved for pollination purposes 
beekeeping is credited by usda with the pollination of many 
agricultural crops having an estimated annual value of around 20 
billion those include many fruits vegetables and hay crops 
glosser said other factors weighed on the decision to cancel the 
quarantines including a shortage of treatment materials and 
limited state and federal resources to conduct and coordinate 
surveys and inspections 
the movement of hundreds of thousands of hives and other 
regulated articles tends to occur during short periods in the 
spring and fall intensifying the demand for inspection services 
beyond the limits of current federal and state resources he said

a veterans group filed suit thursday accusing 
the veterans administration of violating law and procedure by 
paying productivity bonuses to members of appellate boards that 
rule on benefit claims 
the lawsuit by the vietnam veterans of america inc challenged 
the production quotas set by the board of veterans appeal for 
members who sit on threemember panels to review va denials of 
disability benefit claims for servicerelated medical injuries 
the suit also brought on behalf of a veteran who was denied 
disability benefits for psychosis and depression charged that the 
boards chairman kenneth eaton kept a list of senators and 
congressman whose constituents got favorable treatment of their 
appeals 
the practice of paying annual cash bonuses to members of the 
appeal boards for high productivity compromises the quality of 
bva decisionmaking and denies claimants due process said the 
suit filed in us district court 
in order to be eligible for annual bonuses panel members must 
decide at least 40 cases a week according to the lawsuit to speed 
up decisionmaking to meet the quotas one or two members of the 
panel would review the case and get a courtesy signature from 
the remaining members according to the suit 
as a result of these procedures the lawsuit charged thousands 
of vets have had and continue to have their appeals denied under 
circumstances where the deciding bva panel members do not review 
the appeals thoroughly and carefully 
va spokeswoman donna st john said we dont normally comment 
on pending litigation 
the lawsuit charged that complaints bearing supporting letters 
from lawmakers on eatons list were referred to the chairmans 
office for special consideration 
this procedure has no rational basis and bears no relationship 
to the purpose for which vba was established the suit said 
in the 1987 fiscal year the board decided 41296 appeals from 
initial reviews by va regional offices 
it allowed 128 percent of the disability claims denied 65 
percent and sent the rest back to va regional offices for further 
review according to eatons testimony earlier this year to a house 
government operations subcommittee

responding to questions about attorney general 
edwin meese iiis legal problems fbi director william sessions 
said thursday he would resign his own post if the public felt he 
had engaged in improprieties 
if it is perceived that the director of the fbi is not 
properly legally and ethically carrying out his responsibility i 
always have open the route of resignation for myself sessions 
said when asked in the context of meeses legal troubles what he 
would do if he sensed the public thought he was acting improperly 
sessions added that i think theres a great deal of difference 
between a hypothetical situation involving himself and the 
circumstances involving unproven allegations relating to meese 
who has been under criminal investigation since last may 11 
when a reporter asked whether sessions would be unhappy if his 
remarks were interpreted as suggesting that meese his boss 
perhaps ought to resign the fbi director responded 
no i think youll have to draw your own conclusions but he 
quickly added that im trying to talk about general principles 
that i do believe apply to conduct of public officials i can 
speak as to myself but i am not trying to speak as to those 
circumstances that might involve mr meese 
in an interview with reporters sessions refused to address 
meeses legal problems specifically but he did respond in general 
terms about the importance of the public perceiving that law 
enforcement officials uphold the highest legal and ethical 
standards 
independent counsel james mckay has been investigating meeses 
ties to scandalplagued wedtech corp a 1 billion iraqi pipeline 
and other matters sources familiar with the probe say mckay is 
expected to issue a report raising several ethical questions about 
the attorney generals ties to longtime friend e robert wallach 
who is under indictment in the wedtech case 
sessions said it would be pure speculation for him to 
address whether meeses legal problems have contributed to a 
general feeling among americans that they can pick and choose the 
laws they obey 
but the fbi director added 
i dont have any question in my mind that its very important 
to put leaders particularly those who are related to the import of 
the law to be generally perceived by the american public as being 
people who do abide by the law that they seek to enforce 
in the area of the fbi bureau itself its extremely 
important that we are like caesars wife above reproach 
sessions continued 
i read the newspapers i see the television and i know the 
attack he meese is generally under the fbi director said 
but until such time as there is a procedure that tells me that 
he is in violation of the law that is a charge with criminal 
offenses it would be pure speculation to address whether the 
attorney general has contributed to a loss of respect for law by 
the public 
asked about the prospect of ethical questions being raised about 
meeses activities short of indictment sessions said that 
ethical conduct in connection with lawyers particularly is a very 
sensitive matter 
i think its even more important when youre dealing with a 
person who is in fact the attorney general of the united states 
and i think that mr meese would strongly agree with that the 
fbi director added 
after checking with meese about sessions remarks justice 
department spokesman terry eastland declined to comment 
sessions a us district court judge in texas before coming to 
washington has been on the job about six months 
he said the bureau has not launched an investigation of graffiti 
written on justice department walls in recent weeks apparently 
aimed at meese one inscription near the attorney generals office 
said resign another said sleazy it is a crime to deface 
government property

the state department on thursday criticized 
jordans expulsion of an american television reporter and the 
removal of press credentials from two jordanian reporters 
were strongly opposed to penalties imposed on journalists for 
what they write and report said state department spokesman 
charles redman 
redman said its particularly disturbing to the us 
government when an american reporter is expelled from a friendly 
country for what hes reported 
jordan last week expelled nbc correspondent rick davis citing 
dissatisfaction with his coverage of the country and its ruler 
king hussein 
this week jordan withdrew the press credentials of two 
jordanians who write for overseas publications 
we have expressed our strong opposition to mr davis 
expulsion and our deep concern over restrictions against 
journalists in general were continuing to make these points to 
the jordanian authorities redman said

reflecting what one lawmaker called 
electionyear concerns the house voted overwhelmingly thursday to 
order president reagan to use the nations military might to end 
drug smuggling 
the 38523 tally approved a proposal by conservative republicans 
directing reagan to deploy equipment and personnel of the armed 
forces sufficient to halt the unlawful penetration of united states 
borders by aircraft and vessels carrying narcotics 
but even supporters of the measure admitted it is a long way 
from becoming law yes it is flawed said rep jack davis 
rill 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said before the vote of course it will pass easily 
in an election year it wont even be close drugs is an issue 
the proposal was attached as an amendment to the bill 
authorizing defense spending of 299 billion for the fiscal year 
starting oct 1 
the house passed similar antidrug amendments in 1985 and 1986 
on the same bill but the provisions were later dropped by the 
housesenate conference committees that reconciled the house bills 
with senatepassed versions 
no such antidrug proposals which are opposed by the pentagon 
are part of the senate bill that will be on the floor of that 
chamber starting next week 
in other action the house voted to spend 600 million for 
research into the singlewarhead midgetman nucleartipped missile 
and only 100 million for the railbased version of the mx missile 
the antidrug proposal came when aspin sought house approval to 
increase spending by 350 million for the coast guard which has 
reduced antidrug patrols by 55 percent because of budget problems 
the money would be used to pay for more coast guard patrols 
along with buying six more patrol helicopters six patrol boats and 
a pair of radar aircraft to track smugglers 
but davis and other republicans raised the total to 475 
million they also added an amendment ordering reagan to have 
military equipment and personnel seal the us borders against drug 
traffickers 
such equipment and personnel shall be used to locate pursue 
and seize such vessels and aircraft and to arrest their crews 
the measure said 
davis said the problem is that our southern borders are just 
a sieve of cocaine and heroin coming over unchallenged every night 
we want to bring the front lines into this battle against this 
poison coming across our borders 
rep tommy robinson dark said its time to use the armed 
forces to stop the drug cartel 
aspin argued that the proposal should be considered in separate 
antidrug legislation now being prepared we do not want to deal 
with this problem on a piecemeal basis he said 
but davis didnt want to talk technicalities americans arent 
going to understand what were doing here america only wants this 
amendment to be adopted they want the military involved in 
stopping drug traffic he said 
the decision on the nucleartipped missiles was a blow to the 
pentagon which is seeking to develop a railroad version of the 
10warhead mx and wants to eliminate the midgetman 
rep ron dellums dcalif termed the mx rail plan a mobile 
chernobyl referring to the 1985 accident at a soviet nuclear 
power plant 
reagan had sought 793 million for the mx plan and only 200 
million for the midgetman the pending senate legislation proposes 
700 million for the railbased mx and 50 million for midgetman 
by a 233171 margin the house decided to spend only 100 
million for the railbased mx and 600 million for the midgetman 
earlier the chamber voted down 309100 a plan to halt all 
midgetman spending rejected 265143 another amendment to 
eliminate all money for the railbased mx and defeated 247156 a 
third proposal to give 650 million to the mx and 350 million for 
midgetman 
the dispute involves the future of americas landbased 
missiles which are part of the nations nuclear triad that 
also includes submarinelaunched missiles and bombers 
the minuteman is now the heart of the landbased force but 
reagan after a long fight has won approval of congress to build 
50 mx weapons for deployment in landbased silos he wanted 50 more 
and the air force is studying a plan to build 25 trains and put two 
mx missiles on each 
by contrast tenative plans for the midgetman call for building 
up to 500 of the weapons which supporters say would make it more 
difficult for the soviets to attack

record supplies of red meat and poultry for 
the sixth straight year are expected to bite into the financial 
returns of livestock producers in 1988 the agriculture department 
said thursday 
although that is not good news for producers the huge supplies 
will help hold down meat and poultry prices at the retail level 
reduced beef supplies are being more than offset by increased 
volumes of pork and poultry the departments economic research 
service said feed costs are rising due to expanding exports 
increased domestic use and reduced production 
poultry output is being led by an expected 5 percent increase in 
broiler production with most of the increase coming in the first 
half of the year 
commercial pork production rose 7 percent from a year earlier in 
the first quarter of 1988 reflecting a gradual increase by hog 
producers production is expected to be up 10 percent in the second 
quarter from a year earlier 8 percent in the third and about even 
in the fourth 
returns to hog producers may fall to near breakeven before 
the third quarter ends the agency reported and negative 
rekturns are possible in the fall 
beef production will likely rise above yearearlier levels in 
the second quarter because of more feedlot cattle going to 
slaughter at heavier weights 
returns above cash costs for cowcalf producers are expected 
to remain positive in 1988 but returns to great plains cattle 
feeders may turn negative during the late spring and summer the 
report said

a drugstore with his wife maryjane 21 and their 6weekold baby 
kaitlyn who reportedly suffers from serious health problems

a blind lawyer who was arrested for 
refusing to change seats on an airplane at national airport outside 
washington said thursday the charges against her are being dropped 
the virginia state president of the national federation of the 
blind hailed the action as a victory but said the case 
demonstrates the need for better enforcement of a law prohibiting 
airlines from discriminating against the disabled 
peggy pinder 35 practices law in grinnell iowa but was 
visiting washington on republican party business when the incident 
occurred march 31 on a midway airlines jet she was charged in 
arlington county with criminal trespassing when she refused to 
change seats on a flight that was designated open seating 
pinder said that she had found a seat she liked on the plane and 
saw no reason to move she didnt leave until police came and took 
her away 
my attorney told me the charges were being dropped ms 
pinder said in a telephone interview from iowa 
our policy states that disabled passengers are to be placed 
near the floorlevel emergency exit said sandra allen director 
of corporate communications for the chicagobased midway airlines 
our position is that this isnt the end of it said charles 
brown virginia president of the blind federation 
the issue is institutionalized prejudice he said the 
airlines get away with it 
ms pinder said the air carrier access act of 1986 was intended 
to solve the seating problem but because it did not the blind 
have sought stronger legislation a bill pending in congress would 
bar air carriers from using visual acuity or a passengers use of a 
white cane or guide dog as the basis of seating

the reagan administration accused nicaraguas 
marxistled government thursday of systematic moves to 
undermine the peace process and intimidate its political 
opposition 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater commented on reports from 
managua that police detained opposition leaders suspended two 
radio stations from broadcasting and closed one station for 24 
hours 
house speaker jim wright dtexas also said he was concerned 
that the contras have wound up on the losing side of an unbalanced 
equation in the peace talks he promised to send a message to 
nicaragua warning against moves to snuff out remaining contra 
opposition 
in a meeting with contra leader adolfo calero rebel military 
commander enrique bermudez and other members of the contra 
political directorate wright promised to signal that the 
majority in the congress would not look with favor at all on any 
return or resort to military engagement and hoped instead for 
goodfaith negotiations 
wright also said he had asked the state departments agency for 
international development which is administering a 48 million aid 
package for the rebels and for children injured in the war to get 
the aid flowing quickly 
a near miracle happened at esquipulas the town in guatemala 
where the original regional peace accord was signed last aug 7 
the house leader said a near miracle happened march 23 at 
sapoa when the two sides agreed to a 60day ceasefire lets 
work for the third miracle 
in sharply critical remarks at the white house fitzwater said 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega had once again held his true 
colors high showing that he has little intention of supporting a 
free press of allowing democratic dissent or making the reforms 
called for by the guatemala city peace plan 
this intimidation of the media and political opposition can 
only be a further hindrance to the peace process fitzwater said 
in managua spokesmen for opposition parties said that police 
detained more than 25 opposition leaders for about two hours after 
they gathered to support workers on a hunger strike 
on tuesday the nicaraguan interior ministry barred the 
privately owned radio mundial and the roman catholic station radio 
catolica from broadcasting news for eight days it also closed 
radio corporacion for 24 hours for airing false news about the 
strike 
meanwhile on capitol hill members of the house foreign affairs 
committee met with secretary of state george p shultz rep 
william broomfield rmich said after the meeting there is a 
deep concern about the situation that is developing in nicaragua 
the sandinistas are stalling on the negotiations and holding 
us aid as hostage broomfield said shultz declined to answer 
reporters questions after the hourlong closeddoor meeting 
broomfield said the aid package approved a month ago to 
encourage peace talks between the two warring sides has really 
helped the sandinistas jeopardize the contras 
it seems to me the democrat leadership has a responsibility to 
put pressure on the sandinistas to carry out the intent of congress 
and supply humanitarian aid he said 
the sandinistacontra ceasefire agreement allows the rebels to 
receive humanitarian aid inside nicaragua but the only shipments 
thus far have been to rebels based on the honduran side of the 
border 
at a news conference contra leader calero accused the 
sandinistas of trying to force the rebels into a choice between 
hunger and surrender 
he said the insurgents refuse to accept that choice and plan to 
continue negotiations with the sandinistas on the basis of the 
temporary truce signed six weeks ago 
but he said the rebel forces will not enter the seven 
ceasefire zones which have been mutually agreed to if there is 
no assurance of delivery of the aid which has been approved 
the aid of the us government has been held as hostage by the 
sandinista government all this time he said 
wright said none of the 10 million earmarked to pay expenses of 
a nicaraguan verification commission has been spent and added 
thats where the thing may have broken down 
the commission was formed to monitor the march 23 ceasefire 
agreement between the two sides but negotiation have stalled the 
situation has been complicated by a split in contra ranks over 
negotiating strategy and who is to provide military leadership

soviet newspapers are challenging the limits of 
the kremlins policy of greater openness by saying opponents of 
mikhail s gorbachevs reforms should get also media attention 
the latest press comments run counter to guidelines issued last 
month by pravda the communist party daily and show the 
uncertainty and varying views on how far the staterun media can go 
in the campaign for glasnost or openness 
the boldest of the commentators moscow news columnist anatoly 
strelyany holds that banning dissenting voices will not guarantee 
the success of gorbachevs campaign for perestroika or social 
and economic change but could instead make reformers a lot like 
their foes 
im afraid that the conservatives will be forced to shut up 
and go underground strelyany wrote in the may 1 edition of the 
weekly if we seal their lips we may begin to resemble them and 
imperceptibly to ourselves to become them 
thursdays sovietskaya rossiya daily in a lengthy article on 
glasnost said limits are necessary in public debate but that 
outright taboos were not permissible 
writer lev ovrutsky interviewed in the latest edition of the 
weekly literaturnaya gazeta said a dialogue between proponents 
and foes of perestroika is normal in a democratic society 
in april sovietskaya rossiya which like pravda is an organ of 
the communist party central committee was forced to knuckle under 
after pravda criticized its decision to print a letter from a 
leningrad teacher who defended dictator josef v stalin 
nina andreyeva lauded the role of stalin in her countrys 
history and accused his detractors of subversion and ideological 
collusion with leon trotsky stalins archfoe 
pravda called the march 13 publication of her letter an 
attempt little by little to revise party decisions and said 
papers should not print material that criticizes gorbachevs reform 
drive 
gorbachev the communist party chief has condemned the 
political terror and repression of stalins 29year reign pravda 
said gorbachevs opponents continue to bring praise stalin because 
because they feel more comfortable with his tyrannical ways or 
because it serves their personal interests 
pravda added the soviet press is not a private shop and 
communists writing in the press and editors should be aware of 
their responsibility for articles and publications 
on april 6 two days after the pravda attack sovietskaya 
rossiya had to eat crow by reprinting the fullpage pravda article 
the communist party dailys criticism and sovietskaya rossiyas 
backtracking seemed to indicate that glasnost would not extend to 
conservative government critics or to stalinists at least 
moscow news protested and sovietskaya rossiya strongly implied 
that conservatives should be allowed freedom of expression 
a stalinist demands that my lips be sealed thats what makes 
him a stalinist and that people listen only to him strelyany 
wrote in moscow news i dont want his lips to be sealed or mine 
people should be able to listen to both of us 
sovietskaya rossiya said that it was impermissible that taboos 
be laid down that cover shifting opinions and judgments in 
general 
if that happens journalist nikolai yerofeyev wrote glasnost 
will resemble the heavyhanded censorship of the past 
it will easily put us on the same level with those who only 
recently exorcised the spirit of any dissent from literature 
cinema the theater and newspaper pages the paper said 
sovietskaya rossiya did not mention the dispute caused by the 
publication of the prostalin letter or pravdas response but the 
majority of its readers would be aware of those incidents and would 
regard the wednesday article as the latest chapter in the debate on 
glasnost

a television reporter paid two teens to say that 
tawana brawley was at a birthday party during the time she was 
allegedly kidnapped and raped by a white gang the girls advisers 
charged thursday 
and one teens father said his son never knew miss brawley and 
had treated the whole television interview as a big joke the 
boys received between 10 and 100 said the father gregory 
fleming sr 
the reporter who was covering the news conference called by 
miss brawleys advisers denied the charge but said he reimbursed 
one teenager 10 for gasoline 
the dispute was the latest volley of charges and countercharges 
in the highly publicized case that has pitted the black teenager 
and her family against state prosecutors and other officials 
miss brawley 16 of wappingers falls disappeared last nov 24 
and was found four days later huddled in a trash bag with racial 
slurs scrawled on her torso and feces smeared on her body near an 
apartment where she used to live 
she has said she was a victim of a sexual and racial assault 
involving up to six white men one of whom flashed a policelike 
badge 
but the girls advisers the rev al sharpton and attorneys c 
vernon mason and alton maddox have refused to allow her to appear 
before a grand jury investigating the case and have charged 
prosecutors with a coverup 
wednesday night wcbstv reported that miss brawley was seen at 
a birthday party in newburgh the day before she was found and the 
new york daily news said thursday that the girl had run away at 
least twice before and had been beaten by her family when she was 
found 
at their news conference miss brawleys advisers accused the 
media of racist journalism and journalistic rape 
sharpton labeled the wcbs report a media hoax built on the 
whims of young kids and the paranoia of some crack addicts in 
newburgh he promised legal action against the station 
i would call it bribery added mason i would call it 
paying for a story i would think there should be ethics even in 
racist journalism 
mike taibbi the wcbs reporter who broke the story said the 
only money he paid was for sodas at a fastfood restaurant for the 
two teens and 10 to one of the young men to reimburse him for 
gasoline used up driving around during the interview 
we offered no money and we specifically told them we do not 
pay for stories said taibbi 
in the wcbs report an unidentified witness who appeared on 
camera with his face concealed said he spoke with miss brawley at a 
nov 27 birthday party in newburgh for anthony prune burden 
he also said that during part of the fourday period when miss 
brawley claimed she was held captive she spent time with a former 
boyfriend and drug dealer identified by wcbstv as jason 
chico colon 
a second teenager also appeared briefly on the program taibbi 
said he didnt know his name but assumed that he was the young man 
that fleming said was his son 
gregory fleming sr said the mystery witness and his son came 
home laughing after they appeared on camera 
it was a big joke to them fleming told a roomful of 
reporters they didnt understand the position they were in 
they were taken advantage of by the reporter 
attorney general robert abrams who is the special prosecutor 
for the brawley case issued a statement saying all aspects of 
this case including reports that tawana brawley may have been seen 
in newburgh are under continuing investigation 
the daily news reported miss brawley twice ran away from home 
disappearing for more than 24 hours each time before last november 
according to the news the first incident allegedly occurred 
when tawana was 13 and she spent the night with a teenage boy 
watching television when the girl was 14 she took off from school 
on a friday afternoon and spent two days in beacon smoking 
marijuana drinking beer and partying with a girlfriend and two 
men the report said 
in each case her family searched frantically for the girl but 
did not report the disappearance to police the newspaper said 
quoting unidentified friends of the girl and in each case the 
girl was beaten by her mother when she was found the paper said 
the paper quoted sharpton as saying that he did now know if the 
stories of the girls running away and then being beaten were true 
but if they did hit her its not abnormal if anything it 
ways tawana came from a family who cared it doesnt follow she 
fabricated her story

irans fleet of armed small boats has 
grown and increased its activity since irans april 18 clash with 
the us navy in the persian gulf but observers said thursday the 
purpose of the buildup remains a mystery 
gulfbased shipping and salvage officials said commercial 
vessels passing through the strait of hormuz the southern gateway 
to the gulf noted more activity by iranian craft in the last two 
days 
the officials spoke on condition of anonymity 
people reporting in say there havent been any challenges but 
they see a lot of movement by the small boats said one executive 
in washington pentagon officials also reported an unexplained 
increase in numbers and activity of irans small boats along the 
hormuz coast this week 
the fast boats carry weapons ranging from machine guns and 
portable rocketpropelled grenades to mounted antiaircraft cannon 
irans revolutionary guards use them to attack neutral ships in 
retaliation for iraqi air raids on iranian oil tankers 
iraq on thursday claimed its warplanes hit a tanker off iran as 
the weeks fourth convoy of usflagged kuwaiti tankers headed 
down the gulf toward hormuz 
there was no independent confirmation of the raid reported by 
baghdads official news agency the report quoting a military 
spokesman was monitored in cyprus 
on tuesday irans parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani 
accused the united states of backing iraq in the 7yearold gulf 
war and said iran would continue its blowforblow attacks on 
shipping 
the pentagon officials speaking on the condition of not being 
identified said us intelligence monitors were alert for signs 
that iran might challenge washingtons new gettough policy which 
went into effect on tuesday 
the policy permits american warships to intervene in iranian 
attacks on vessels not flying the american flag previously the 
us vessels were restricted to defending americanflagged ships 
iran condemned the change as proof of us aggression and 
promised to avenge last months clash in which us forces wrecked 
two iranian oil platforms and sank or disabled six craft 
irans losses included two of its best naval frigates a 
missilearmed patrol boat and three swedishbuilt boghammar marin 
speedboats 
the us action was in retaliation for irans laying of mines 
one of which damaged the us frigate samuel b roberts on april 14 
and wounded 10 crew men 
tehran said 44 iranians were killed two marine corps pilots 
died when their ah1 cobra helicopter gunship was lost evidently 
to hostile fire 
pentagon officials said they were monitoring an increase in the 
number of small gunboats at bandar abbas irans main naval base 
overlooking the strait 
one source said the fleet had grown in the last two days to 
about 100 from a normal level of several dozen 
the officials said us intelligence analysts were not overly 
excited by the buildup but the reason for it was not known 
they said it was too early to conclude that iran was planning a 
largescale move to test the new us policy depite its losses 
irans naval force is still potent according to military analysts 
adm william j crowe jr chairman of the joint chiefs of 
staff said during a visit to manama that there are a number of 
threats that the iranian navy still represents 
iran has about ten large ships not all of them seaworthy 10 
fast patrol boats and a variety of other craft the lost boghammars 
were only a small fraction of hundreds of highspeed armed boats 
iran said three days ago that its patrol boats in the hormuz had 
resumed challenging commercial vessels in search of warrelated 
cargo for iraq 
iran also claimed that an american warship stopped an iranian 
cargo ship iran mehrab on tuesday and questioned its crew 
us officials in manama were not available to comment on that 
claim 
the official islamic republic news agency monitored in cyprus 
said the incident proves washingtons intentions to expand its 
aggression in the gulf 
the united states now has 17 warships in the gulf including a 
missile cruiser two destroyers and four missile frigates 
the convoy sailing southward included the 79999ton oil 
products tankers chesapeake city and ocean city the voyage began a 
day after another convoy arrived at kuwait

the middle ages have gotten a bad rap 
and the approximately 2000 medieval scholars meeting here are 
trying to improve the eras image and promote it as an avenue of 
study 
the 23rd international congress on medieval studies convened 
wednesday at western michigan university which has one of the 
oldest medieval studies programs in the country and holds the event 
each year 
it is very much a distortion to look at the middle ages as the 
dark ages full of misery and ignorance said otto grundler 
director of westerns medieval institute this was a period of 
enormous creativity and advancement in all fields 
the first conference was held in 1962 one year after the 
institute was established as a way to bring scholars in the field 
together and present their current research grundler said 
for the first few years it was a regional meeting with about 
150 participants now more than 2000 professors and graduate 
students representing 23 countries attend the fourday conference 
grundler said 
research is presented on nearly 100 subjects ranging from 
medieval magic and medicine to family relationships in the middle 
ages considered the period of european history from 476 ad to 
1450 ad ending with the renaissance 
there are a lot of academic conferences where historians talk 
to historians and people in old english talk to people in old 
english but here we talk across the boundaries of disciplines 
grundler said 
you cant understand the social history of the middle ages 
without understanding its political history or the economic 
conditions without knowing church history he said the whole 
field of medieval studies represents one of the best examples of 
the need for general knowledge and a broadbased education 
westerns program has graduated 50 students with masters 
degrees in medieval studies and grundler said hes seen a dramatic 
increase in interest in the program 
students get all kinds of romantic notions about the medieval 
period through movies and books and after taking a course simply 
become fascinated he said 
grundler said many students who earn masters degrees in the 
program later get their doctorates and go into teaching

a house subcommittee with relatively little 
dispute approved a 133 billion foreign aid bill thursday for the 
year beginning oct 1 largely continuing current programs 
the appropriations foreign operations subcommittee adopted the 
measure on a voice vote at the end of a closeddoor drafting 
session it represents about a 2 percent increase over last years 
aid spending level and now goes to the full appropriations 
committee which is trying to expedite passage of its 13 individual 
spending measures this year 
its a spare bill said chairman david obey dwis but it 
addresses the most urgent needs we have obey said the 
administration generally supported the measure the passage of 
which was eased by agreement on a spending ceiling in last years 
budget agreement between congress and the white house 
as usual the lions share of aid will go to israel which is 
guaranteed 18 billion in military aid and 12 billion in 
economic help egypt ranks a close second with 13 billion in 
military assistance and 815 million in economic aid 
pakistan which has served as a conduit for us aid to the 
rebels fighting the soviet army in neighboring afghanistan would 
receive 220 million in economic aid and 240 million in forgiven 
loans for purchase of military goods 
another 124 million in economic aid and 125 million in 
military aid was earmarked for the philippines and 90 million in 
economic support and another 655 million in economic development 
money would be used for african countries 
in central america honduras would get 85 million in economic 
aid costa rica 90 million el salvador 185 million and guatemala 
80 million military aid for those and other countries was not 
earmarked but would come out of separate military aid and credit 
accounts 
the bill also would give economic aid of 40 million to 
portugal 20 million to morocco 10 million to tunisia 15 
million to cyprus between 10 million and 35 million for ireland 
and 2 million for polands solidarity trade union 
some 34 million would be set aside for middle east development 
projects of which 11 million is for projects in jordan and 23 
million for those in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
the bill also would allocate 150 million to the peace corps 
101 million for international narcotics control 362 million for 
migration and refugee assistance 35 million for the prevention of 
aids worldwide and 254 million to pay pastdue debts of 
international financial institutions 
it would send 217 million to support a long list of united 
nations organizations and stipulate that the money for unicef must 
be obligated within 30 days of passage of the bill or the 
administration would suffer an automatic cut of 50 million in 
money for military aid

a day after a state lawmaker turned up two 
phantom workers in the treasury department treasurer robert bowman 
announced thursday that he was firing the ghostly bureaucrats 
bowman said the practice of signing phony names on letters to 
taxpayers had worked well for years but he no longer could defend 
the policy because it hurt the agencys credibility with the public 
today at three oclock we received the resignation of scott 
shepard and susan sally what was the other ones name susan 
stadler bowman told reporters at a whimsical press briefing in 
his conference room 
i had a hard time defending to myself why we do it bowman 
said noting that the policy began about 1981 two years before he 
took office 
state rep mat dunaskiss had called a news conference wednesday 
to complain that a constituent received warning letters signed by 
treasury department employees susan sadler and scott shepard 
neither of whom exist 
bowman who said he first learned of policy two weeks ago 
originally defended it wednesday as a way to speed up the handling 
of taxpayer calls 
on thursday he explained the problem weve run into in the 
past is theyve taxpayers asked for the person who signed the 
letter and the supervisors not there thats when they start 
playing telephone tag they want to talk to the person who signed 
the letter were hopeful we will be able to overcome that 
reporters had been told they would be attending a funeral 
for the two ghost employees and dunaskiss got into the spirit 
playfully presenting bowman with a bouquet of flowers 
your sensitivity as always to these employees is 
overwhelming bowman said with a laugh i greatly appreciate 
that we will send it on to their respective families 
on a more serious note dunaskiss said he was pleased the policy 
was dropped quickly he had described it as a serious breach of 
public trust 
he handed reporters a picture of a tombstone with an inscription 
reading here lies susan amp scott we thought they were but they 
were not we hope they eternally rest in peace and taxpayers 
harassment will finally cease 
bowman said its common for consumeroriented businesses across 
the nation to use the phony names to speed up service but said he 
also realized the state should behave differently 
we were not trying to dodge taxpayers to the contrary we 
were serving taxpayers well but i just couldnt dodge the 
accountability angle because if scott shepard does exist people 
ought to be able to come here and see scott shepard he said 
bowman said he didnt know how many phony names his department 
used during the past eight years 
from now on all taxpayer letters will be signed by the division 
supervisors with a note on the bottom for callers to ask for a 
specific division bowman said 
dunaskiss said the treasury department wasnt the first in 
michigan to be found to have ghost employees 
people were shocked a few months ago when a ghost named fred 
johnson surfaced in the department of natural resources now weve 
found ghosts in the area of tax collection dunaskiss had said 
wednesday

the securities and exchange commisssion acted 
thursday to reduce the opportunity for insider trading by 
authorizing brief trading halts across domestic markets when 
important news affecting a specific stock is pending 
the commission by a 32 vote voted to give the national 
association of securities dealers authority to ban overthecounter 
trading in exchangelisted stocks a practice called third market 
trading 
currently when the new york stock exchange or another exchange 
halts trading because of a pending announcement the nasd can bar 
its member firms from using the associations automated systems to 
offer quotes on the stock 
however it cannot bar brokerage firms from making a private 
market while exchange trading is halted 
some firms such as jeffries amp co have been willing to act as 
an intermediary for professional traders who want to buy and sell 
stock before announcements of takeovers major contracts and other 
news 
sec chairman david s ruder in supporting the proposal said it 
would reduce the opportunity for insider trading he also said he 
was troubled by the current arrangement which appears to favor 
professionals with more access to market information over small 
investors 
any perception that professional investors are being given an 
advantage will harm efforts to encourage small investors rattled 
by the october stock market crash to return to the market 
the action was opposed by commissioners charles c cox and 
joseph a grundfest who argued that it would unnecessarily 
restrict the freedom of the market 
grundfest said stock holders have a right to reduce their risk 
by selling stock before an announcement and that a trader willing 
to take on the risk had a right to buy he said the rights of small 
investors would not necessarily be enhanced by restricting 
professional traders 
cox said he has seen no evidence that small investors have been 
harmed by their inability to take part in third market trading 
he said insider trading is rarely caused by the ability to trade 
a few minutes before a news release you can always prevent 
insider trading by preventing trading but obviously we are not 
going that far he said 
joining ruder were commissioners aulana l peters and edward h 
fleischman they acknowledged that expanding trading halts could 
impinge on the freedom of the market but they said that concern 
was outweighed by the need to protect investors 
in another matter the commission voted 50 to ask congress for 
authority to issue subpoenas and take testimony on behalf of 
securities regulators and foreign governments 
as part of an international effort to combat insider trading and 
other securities fraud the sec is asking foreign governments to 
assist the united states in pursuing evidence of violations the 
sec needs additional authority from congress to reciprocate 
the sec and regulators in the canadian provinces of ontario 
quebec and british columbia signed a cooperation agreement in 
january ruder has said he is pursuing cooperation pacts with japan 
and great britain

a helicopter plucked office workers from the 
roof of calfornias tallest building as fire gutted four floors of 
the 62story first interstate bank tower and left one person dead 
and 40 injured early thursday 
damage was estimated at 450 million making the blaze the worst 
highrise fire in los angeles history fire officails said 
a sprinkler system was being installed in the 859foot 
skyscraper but was not quite complete 
it looked like dantes inferno fire capt steve varney 
said everything that was burnable burned down it was just 
metal and that was red hot 
a small but undetermined number of people were working in the 
office tower when the blaze broke out about 1030 pm wednesday 
during the workday the building is occupied by 3500 people 
it could have been a towering inferno it could have been 
worse said city councilman john ferraro the 1974 movie the 
towering inferno depicted a los angeles office building fire 
some workers fled down stairs in thick smoke others fled to the 
roof as the fire roiled around the 12th through 15th floors and 
rained glass and flaming debris on downtown streets 
four helicopters with searchlights swooped around the rooftop 
and one helicopter lifted 10 people to safety officers said 
we came out and we couldnt see anything but smoke said 
radmila radich a cleaning woman who escaped 
firefighters wearing air tanks had to lug hoses down stairs from 
the roof and up from the ground to attack the flames some air 
tanks ran out and firefighters had to do without them said fire 
chief donald manning 
they had 2000degree temperatures they were fighting 
manning said of the 300 firefighters the individuals in there 
were committed so far in on the fire that they would run out of 
air they could not back out they had to stay there and fight that 
fire or they knew as they told me they were gonna die 
this had a potential of killing a lot of my people manning 
said 
damage was estimated at a preliminary 450 million said fire 
department spokesman greg acevedo 
the cause of the blaze was under investigation said fire cmdr 
donald anthony 
if a sprinkler system had been operating it would probably 
would have contained the fire to a very small area anthony said 
a preliminary inspection indicated the structural framework 
remained sound said frank kroker an official of the department of 
building and safety 
a cleaning supervisor zora imamovic said that while she and 
five others made their way from the 58th floor to the roof to be 
flown to safety she heard a man calling for help over her twoway 
radio 
one of the men was saying car 33 a freight elevator was in 
flames and he was screaming please help she said 
the badly burned body of janitor alexander handy 22 of 
palmdale was found in an elevator stuck on the 12th floor said 
county coroners spokesman steve stewart 
thirtyseven maintenance workers and three firefighters were 
treated for burns or smoke inhalation but no one was hospitalized 
officials said 
the fire was declared under control 3 hours after it was 
reported two survivors werent brought down from the 37th floor 
until about dawn 
the skyscraper had no sprinkler system because it was built in 
1973 before fire codes required sprinklers manning said workers 
were installing a 35 million system after the bank voluntarily 
decided to do so 
william siart chairman and president of first interstate bank 
said the system was 90 percent installed 
art devine chief of management in the building department said 
he will meet with the fire department to determine whether city 
council should be asked to revise the code 
workers were told by radio stations to remain at home thursday 
but some were too curious to stay away 
when i got to the corner and i saw the firefighters i said 
oh my god said claudia gonzalez 26 a trust administration 
specialist im still counting the floors i could have been 
there said the 11thfloor worker 
first interstate has assets of 585 billion and is the nations 
eighth largest banking company with 44 banks and offices in 19 
states the fire is not expected to affect customers said 
spokesman john popovich 
operations on the gutted floors included foreign exchange 
trading corporate loan administration personal trusts economics 
advertising and public affairs 
the bank keeps backup copies of customer records but 
correspondence and some other files were lost popovich said most 
of the computers that control checking and savings accounts and 
other business are in a building six blocks away he said

weary strikers in the shipyard where the 
short life of free unionism began roused themselves to chant 
there is no freedom without solidarity hundreds of riot police 
ringing the yard listened impassively 
the workers began thursday morning to prepare for an assault by 
police after riot squads stormed the nowa huta steel mill in 
southern poland ending a 10dayold strike their only question 
was when 
lech walesa said he would be the last to leave as the deadlock 
continued into the night in this baltic port he is the shipyard 
worker who built a fledgling strike in august 1980 into a movement 
that brought down a government and won him the 1983 nobel peace 
prize 
after withdrawing a blockade of the huge lenin shipyard for a 
few hours early thursday police returned in force before 9 am 
and put it under virtual siege 
officers diverted traffic several blocks from the main gate and 
a cordon of riot police prevented entry to the plant strikers in 
poland occupy the place they work rather than leaving it 
security forces patrolled the streets of gdansk which are lined 
with solid brown brick buildings and workingclass apartment 
houses and they occasionally checked the papers of pedestrians 
only people living near the yard were allowed through the blockade 
dozens of people watched the shipyard scene from their balconies 
or windows 
a huge solidarity banner hung from the main gate dozens of 
strikers sat on the gatehouse roof 
crowds of several hundred had gathered in front of the main gate 
before the blockade but riot police dispersed them 
shouts of there is no freedom without solidarity from 
inside the yard could be heard several blocks away 
police built a metal fence during the day around the square 
outside the gate 
the squares dominating feature is a huge monument with three 
crosses honoring baltic coast workers killed during strikes in 
1970 that brought down another polish government 
building it was a promise walesa made in 1980 and it was 
dedicated later that year solidarity the first independent union 
in the soviet bloc was suppressed and crushed after martial law 
was imposed dec 13 1981 
dozens of police vehicles were parked about 300 yards from the 
gate during the day so the strikers could see them clearly 
management refused to meet with the strikers who gradually 
became convinced a raid was imminent unless they gave up walesa 
told them ill be the last to leave 
the blockade appeared to relax somewhat by late afternoon 
regular police withdrew leaving only the riot officers and most 
of their vehicles moved out of view

soviet union in late may for 10 days of symphonic summitry 
coinciding with president reagans summit talks with soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev orchestra and soviet officials announced 
thursday 
the orchestra will be performing in leningrad while reagan and 
gorbachev are meeting in moscow and neither leader was expected to 
attend a concert during their fiveday summit officials said 
the philharmonic making its first soviet tour with music 
director zubin mehta and only the third in its 146year history 
will travel to moscow for a series of concerts starting june 4 two 
days after the reagangorbachev talks officially end 
albert k webster managing director of the orchestra said he 
told soviet officials the tour would be an exercise in symphonic 
summitry but they did not comprehend his meaning the idea is 
totally untranslatable in russian he said 
at a news conference in an oakpaneled chandeliered salon of 
the soviet embassy cultural attache alexander potemkin hailed the 
philharmonic tour as an important event in the us and soviet 
cultural exchanges that have proliferated since the first 
reagangorbachev summit in geneva in 1985 
i assure you the soviet public is awaiting you with great 
interest potemkin told mehta 
the soviet attache said plans are being arranged for a us tour 
by the soviet state symphony orchestra starting next october 
the climax of the philharmonics seven performances in leningrad 
and moscow from may 28 to june 9 will be a joint final concert with 
the soviet state symphony orchestra in moscows famed gorky park on 
june 8 
mehta will lead the combined orchestras in hector berliozs

the philharmonic also will present the world premiere of a 
symbolon a work which the orchestra commissioned for the tour 
from pulitzer prizewinning american composer ellen taaffe zwilich 
mehta told reporters he did not anticipate any difficulty 
communicating with soviet musicians in rehearsal even though he 
doesnt speak their language because musical notations are 
traditionally written and spoken in italian 
piu forte louder is understood by every musician in the 
world mehta said 
the philharmonic tour arranged at the invitation of the soviet 
ministry of culture is the first since 1976 when it was led by 
erich leinsdorf and thomas schippers the first soviet tour took 
place in 1959 under leonard bernstein and schippers 
i believe it has been too long since the new york philharmonic 
has been in the soviet union and in contact with the great musical 
community there said stephen stamas the philharmonic president 
mehta said he has taken the philharmonic on tours around the 
world in his 10 years as music director but never to the soviet 
union the last cultural vacuum in my life will be filled he 
said 
the tour is sponsored by the cocacola co combustion

an izvestia photographer was killed and another 
seriously wounded by a grenade attack on the military convoy in 
which they were riding in afghanistan soviet media reported 
thursday 
izvestia the government newspaper published frontpage 
photographs of alexander sekretarev 29 who was killed in the 
attack wednesday and his wounded colleague sergei sevruk the 
headline on an accompanying article was while fulfilling 
professional responsibility 
the newspaper and a tass news agency report said others were 
killed or wounded in the ambush three miles north of kabul the 
capital of afghanistan but it did not say how many 
grief from afghanistan has visited many a home in our 
country izvestia said 
tass said sekretarev was killed when three armored personnel 
carriers came under fire from a grenade launcher in a vineyard 
along the road to the salang tunnel which runs under the hindu 
kush mountain range 
anticommunist rebels have fought the sovietbacked government 
since a communist coup in april 1978 soviet military forces 
entered the country in december 1979 
about 115000 soviet soldiers now are in afghanistan but the 
kremlin has agreed to pull them out in nine months beginning may 15 
izvestia said sekretarev was sent to afghanistan two weeks ago 
to report on the withdrawal 
his memory will be preserved in the photos which he took and 
transmitted to the editorial office tass said 
the convoy probably was one of the military units preparing to 
leave since the route out of afghanistan for the soviets is 
through the salang tunnel 
western diplomats based in kabul told reporters who have been 
there in the past few weeks that rebels plan to attack soviet 
convoys leaving the country

a namibian rebel leader said thursday the 
united states should support independence for his homeland without 
regard to the presence of cuban troops in neighboring angola 
sam nujoma president of the south west africa peoples 
organization met with senior us officials on thursday and called 
on the united states to pressure the racist south african 
regime into granting independence and black majority rule to 
namibia africas last colony 
nujoma visited the state department after talks earlier this 
week in london with officials from the united states south africa 
angola and cuba 
among the issues they discussed was the situation in namibia 
where nujomas forces have fought south african colonial rule for 
more than two decades 
the united states and south africa believe independence for 
namibia should be linked to the withdrawal of the more than 40000 
cuban troops from angola 
we hope the us will not continue to insist on linking 
namibias independence with the withdrawal of cuban troops 
nujoma said reaffirming a longstanding position after his 
meeting with michael armacost the state departments third ranking 
official 
we dont want that linkage swapo disagrees with that 
linkage he said adding that swapo is ready to sign a ceasefire 
with south africa 
nujoma said he wants immediate implementation of a un security 
council resolution that sets down procedures for a transition to an 
independent government in namibia 
south africa would benefit from an independent namibia he said 
because the war is a drain on south african resources and the 
occupation army has been suffering numerous casualties 
while supporting independence for namibia the united states has 
been wary of swapo because it has received soviet backing for 
years nujoma expressed hope that the atmosphere of 
reconciliation between the united states and the soviet union 
will speed the independence process in namibia

a us attorney who formerly ran the justice 
departments narcotics division announced through an aide thursday 
he is being considered as head of the departments criminal 
division 
on wednesday an administration source speaking on condition of 
anonymity said that edward sg dennis jr us attorney in 
philadelphia was the choice of attorney general edwin meese iii to 
fill the position 
if approved dennis would be the highestranking black 
appointment in the justice department during meeses tenure meese 
has been faulted for a dearth of appointments of blacks and women 
first assistant us attorney thomas lee confirmed that dennis 
is under consideration but declined further comment pending a 
formal decision dennis was in meetings with the justice department 
on thursday lee said 
the source on wednesday said that dennis is apparently the only 
name meese has submitted to the white house for the position a 
background check is under way 
dennis 43 has built a reputation during his five years as 
united states attorney through a vigorous prosecution of political 
corruption 
dennis would fill a vacancy created by the resignation of 
assistant attorney general william weld chief of the criminal 
division 
also forwarded to the white house was the name of harold g 
christensen of salt lake city for the job of deputy attorney 
general christensen 67 is a partner in the firm of snow 
christensen amp martineau 
weld and deputy attorney general arnold burns resigned march 29 
out of concern that meeses continued tenure at justice despite a 
nearly yearlong criminal investigation hurt the departments 
operation several top level justice department posts have been 
left vacant 
the two vacancies at the top have been an embarrassment for 
meese and the reagan administration other candidates for the jobs 
have rejected the offers or have withdrawn their names after 
damaging disclosures about their personal lives 
republican senate aides have said privately that anyone meese 
nominates for the vacant top posts in justice may have a difficult 
time being confirmed but one such aide said dennis might have a 
better chance because he is a career justice department employee 
weld said wednesday that dennis is an outstanding us 
attorney and would be on my short list for any top job at the 
justice department 
my understanding is that the attorney general has met and 
talked to dennis and the attorney general thinks very highly of 
him said justice department spokesman terry eastland 
any announcement on who will fill the criminal division post 
is a matter for the white house to decide said eastland 
weld said dennis did an excellent job running the narcotics 
section in the criminal division before taking the post in 
philadelphia in 1983 dennis also has moved aggressively against 
organized crime he said 
i cannot say enough good things about him he said 
dennis attended the university of pennsylvania law school he 
worked as an assistant us attorney in pennsylvanias eastern 
district in 1980 he became chief of the justice departments 
narcotics and dangerous drugs division 
when he took over the philadelphia office an investigation of 
police corruption had just started dennis set out to crack the 
code of silence that prevented police officers from testifying 
against each other 
after a fouryear investigation his office won more than 25 
convictions ranging from patrolman to deputy commissioner 
in his most notable case dennis personally won convictions 
against reputed mob boss nicodemo scarfo city councilman leland 
beloff and beloffs chief aide on charges of trying to extort 1 
million from a developer 
scarfo was sentenced to 14 years in prison

production of a fuel component for the 
space shuttle and military rockets was halted thursday after a 
blast destroyed one plant and a defense contractor closed the only 
other plant making the compound 
nasa and pentagon officials said the accident should not 
immediately affect the shuttle or military programs such as the mx 
missile 
however morton thiokol inc a prime contractor on the shuttle 
said the blast wednesday that leveled a pacific engineering and 
production co plant near henderson could delay production of 
shuttle booster rockets 
the earthquakeforce blast killed two people and injured more 
than 250 four critically the plant manufactured ammonium 
perchlorate which is used in solid rocket fuel for the shuttle and 
the mx titan and minuteman missiles 
kerrmcgee corp of oklahoma city on thursday shut down 
production of ammonium perchlorate at its plant in henderson a 
mile from the pacific plant 
the contractor said it wanted to determine what went wrong at 
the pacific plant and assess the minor damage that the kerrmcgee 
henderson plant sustained from the blasts concussion including a 
damaged wall and broken windows 
kerrmcgee officials would not say when the plant would reopen 
were just being absolutely certain theres no problem 
kerrmcgee spokesman paul reed said in a telephone interview from 
oklahoma city if weve got any doubt theres a joker in the 
deck we would take another look 
at this point we have no idea how it happened said mp 
grotheer director of process technology at kerrmcgee 
grotheer said the army armament and research development command 
tested ammonium perchlorate in 1982 and found the compound is not 
explosive per se 
the tests mixed the compound with blasting caps black powders 
and matches and although the mixtures would burn they would not 
explode he said 
pentagon officials said thiokol has a twoyear supply of 
ammonium perchlorate they said pacific produced about 60 percent 
of the ammonium perchlorate needed for the shuttle with kerrmcgee 
producing the rest 
thiokol spokesman rocky raab said the defense department might 
claim all of the ammonium perchlorate produced at the kerrmcgee 
plant for missiles 
if the pacific engineering plant is down for an indefinite 
period of time there could be delays in our production raab 
said 
a pentagon official on thursday said it was too soon to say if 
the military would monopolize keermcgees production of ammonium 
perchlorate 
nasa officials have said that solidfuel boosters have been made 
already for the next five shuttle launches including the planned 
late august launch of discovery the first shuttle mission since 
the challenger accident

a syrian businessman involved in efforts to free 
the last french hostages in lebanon said thursday that france 
finished repaying a 1billiondollar iranian loan in order to free 
the men 
it was paid back in three installments the last one just very 
recently omran adham said in an interview with the associated 
press this is my information from the french syrians and 
iranians 
adham 41 a commodities trader with a syrian diplomatic 
passport was expelled from france tuesday night and is staying at 
a geneva hotel 
he said he was certain the french government offered 
compensation for the kidnappers although he had no proof 
there were presents for everybody he said declining to 
elaborate 
reports in paris and beirut said that in exchange for the 
release of marcel carton marcel fontaine and jeanpaul kauffmann 
france agreed to repay the outstanding balance on a loan originally 
totaling 1 billion made by the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi 
the french government froze payments after the 1979 islamic 
revolution in iran 
radio france internationale citing diplomatic sources said two 
payments had been made and the french government will sign a check 
for 400 million in the next few days 
interior minister charles pasqua vigorously denied thursday that 
france paid a ransom 
adham said french president francois mitterrand asked him to 
mediate in march 1986 and gave him a letter for president hafez 
assad of syria 
adham said he contacted assad about 10 times in two years and 
asked the syrian leader to pass messages to iran which was 
believed to have influence over the kidnappers 
adham said he most recently traveled to damascus the syrian 
capital on march 9 as part of an official french delegation 
including negotiator jeancharles marchiani pasquas personal 
representative 
prior to his expulsion adham lived in paris for 11 years with 
his french wife and four children 
he charged prime minister jacques chirac ordered him to leave in 
order to monopolize credit for the release of the three hostages 
held since 1985 chirac is a candidate for the french presidency in 
a runoff election on sunday 
in paris arab diplomatic and french government sources have 
said that pasqua who is close to chirac was annoyed by adhams 
statements to the media about an imminent release of the three 
hostages just before the first round of the presidential elections 
april 24 
adham said the french government wanted to divert all credit 
from me they are seeking maximum advantage from the hostage 
affair they knew on tuesday that the liberation was nearly at 
hand he said 
he said he drew no material benefit from his missions 
i dont need the french government financially because i have 
good business all over the world i can live wherever i want he 
added 
but he said lawyers are challenging the expulsion and he expects 
to return to paris

awaited the day for three years premier jacques chirac hinted that 
france might restore diplomatic relations with tehran

jeanpaul kauffmann 44 arrived at the military airport of 
villacoublay outside paris in a government jet 
iran said its intervention brought about the release of the 
three tehran television monitored in cyrpus quoted ali reza 
moayyeri a deputy prime minister for political affairs as saying 
iran interceded for humanitarian reasons 
french goverment officials denied they paid ransom for the 
hostages release comment abroad however ranged from dubious to 
scathing complaints from britain and elsewhere accused france of 
dealing with terrorists while 18 other foreigners remain hostage 
fontaine said his cellmate was terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press 
we survived he told a reporter from french televisions 
channel 5 i passed the time playing dominoes and chess with my

alexander approached him then when he recognized him kauffmann 
expressed delight at how much the boy had grown 
alexanders eyes filled with tears as he put his hands on his 
fathers shoulders and looked him at him silently 
as we all know the liberation of our hostages falls into the 
framework of our relations with iran said chirac who greeted 
the men at the airport its the authorities in tehran who 
intervened with the captors so that they would free our 
countrymen

iranian embassy employee wahid gordji refused to submit to 
questioning about bombings in paris in september 1986 gordji was 
allowed to leave paris two days after two french hostages were 
freed in beirut

also a day which remains overshadowed because we are just three 
the journalist for the weekly magazine levenement de jeudi said 
earlier that michel seurat the 39yearold researcher captured 
with him on may 22 1985 probably died of cancer rather than 
having been executed as claimed by the kidnappers 
carton and fontaine were kidnapped march 22 1985 
kauffman praised seurats courage and said seurat encouraged his 
companions during his early days in captivity that he could die 
all alone after contributing so much is awful i cannot forget

hospital in southern paris for two days of observation and were 
visited by president francois mitterrand 
at the airport chirac thanked a friend of france and iran 
but provided no details political observers said he was referring 
to algeria which was believed to have played a key role in the 
hostage negotiations 
the premier also thanked syrian president hafez assad and 
lebanese military authorities 
interior minister charles pasqua supervised the negotiations 
reports in paris and beirut said that in exchange for the three 
frenchmen france agreed to pay the outstanding balance on a loan 
originally totaling 1 billion made by the late shah mohammad reza 
pahlavi

jesse jackson sharpened his criticism of 
the democratic delegateselection process thursday complaining of 
a push for coronation of rival michael duakis 
we must not give the impression by the inflated padded lead 
made by the super delegates and their friends that the race is 
over resulting in a feeling among jackson supporters that their 
vote does not count he said 
jackson complained vigorously about party rules during his 1984 
presidential bid but has generally steered clear of such objections 
this year 
he said thursday he has no intention of formally challenging the 
rules as he did in 1984 but expects party leaders to intervene when 
the delegate count especially among atlarge delegates and the 
643 super delegates varies widely from the popular vote in 
the democratic primaries 
thats all were asking for a matter of good judgment he 
said 
jackson has won 28 percent of the votes in primaries so far but 
is publicly supported by just 46 super delegates the massachusetts 
governor meanwhile has won 37 percent of the votes cast in the 
primaries and is supported by 166 super delegates 
the super delegates were created for this years campaign 
specifically to give the party establishment a significant voice 
outside the primary process in choosing the nominee they are party 
leaders and politicians including governors and members of 
congress who are delegates to the democratic national convention 
by virture of the offices they hold 
overall dukakis has about 1500 delegates while jackson has 
about 930 according to the associated press delegate count 
jackson brought up the delegate matter as he ate breakfast with 
a nebraska farm family outside kearney and again in talking to 
reporters at the airport 
he said his campaign will contact super delegates and atlarge 
delegates in congressinal districts where he won and try to 
persuade them to follow the voters choices when they vote at the 
party convention this summer 
well be making appeals for fairness and we certainly hope 
people will respond he said 
jackson delegate counter steve cobble said he and other 
officials recognize that the rules do not require delegates to 
commit themselves proportionately with the popular vote 
were saying heres another way they could behave cobble 
said 
some states do choose delegates in proportion to the popular 
vote but in pennsylvania for example which does not have such a 
system jackson got 28 percent of the vote and only 8 percent of 
the delegates cobble said 
the race is much closer than the pundits and the press 
project jackson said what the people are saying must not be 
covered up by all the horse talk of the coronation and the race is 
over the race is on he said 
jackson said he was not threatening to withhold support from the 
party if his wishes are not met but he also recounted past 
elections in which he said republicans won a embittered democrats 
stayed home 
he cited the 1980 reelection bid of thenpresident carter who 
had been challenged in the primaries by sen edward kennedy dmass 
after the divisive primary race many of kennedys followers 
became embittered by the process and some had taken an 
anybodybut carter position jackson said carter lost to ronald 
reagan 
at this point lets be positive about it lets be hopeful 
about it the most positive consequence of being fair is that 
people are inspired when people are inspired and diligent they 
work diligently jackson said 
however he added that the perception he was being treated 
unfairly could keep his supporters away from the polls in november 
they get discouraged he said 
jackson addressed a high school audience in kearney a small 
rural town of mostly white residents 
dressed for the day in blue jeans a vest and truckers cap 
jackson then flew to albuquerque nm for a rally 
talking there with a busload of hispanic and civic leaders 
jackson spoke against the idea of making english the national 
language saying that is not reaching out its pushing out 
the movement is strongly opposed by hispanics 
he also spoke about immigration affairs saying us policy 
should begin with efforts to help latin american nations improve 
their standards of living 
jackson flew from albuquerque to los angeles where his schedule 
included a visit to the citys historic downtown olivera street 
traditional hub of hispanic culture and a hollywood fundraiser

a canadian trawler was arrested 
thursday by authorities from the frenchheld islands of st pierre 
and miquelon which are the subject of a boundary and fishing quota 
dispute between canada and france 
tom rideout newfoundlands fisheries minister said preliminary 
reports indicated the trawler was stopped in contested waters about 
48 miles from st pierre 
if that is the case both countries have agreed not to arrest 
boats in that area and this is a very very serious matter 
rideout said the only motivation i can think of is political 
the french presidential elections 
he was referring to the runoff elections this sunday between 
incumbent socialist francois mitterrand and conservative prime 
minister jacques chirac 
a french military vessel arrested the trawler said john banys 
a federal fisheries department official in ottawa 
residents in st pierre said the trawler the maritimer fishes 
out of fortune newfoundland and has a crew of five or six after 
the arrest at sea the trawler was directed into port at st pierre 
and miquelon 
im outraged by it and im sure all newfoundlanders will be 
outraged as well said richard cashin head of the fishermens 
union that represents the crew its an example of french 
arrogance 
the incident appeared to be retaliation 
last month a trawler from st pierre was arrested in canadian 
waters and 21 french citizens on board including four politicians 
were jailed for fishing illegally the french government posted 
bail of 510300 us to get them released and temporarily 
withdrew its ambassador from ottawa 
at the heart of the dispute is frances claim of a 200mile 
economic zone around st pierre and miquelon where the population 
of 6000 relies on fishing and tourism to survive 
canada recognizes only a 12mile french zone around the islands 
whose closest point is just 10 miles from newfoundland 
the two countries dispute the international boundary of st 
pierre and miquelon and the share of cod and other fish they can 
take from the waters south of newfoundland when attempts at a 
negotiated settlement failed last year canada closed its ports to 
all french fishing vessels and banned them from the nearby gulf of 
st lawrence 
talks resumed last month in paris and both sides agreed to seek 
a neutral mediator

women in denmarks armed forces can 
now drive tanks and perform other duties once carried out 
exclusively by men the defense ministry announced thursday 
the decision was based on a study of womens performances in the 
army air force and navy 
women have been training and serving alongside men on naval 
vessels on an experimental basis for several years psychologists 
and physicians monitored the experiment and recommended that the 
arrangement be made permanent 
after evaluating the reports from the experiments i am 
satisfied that the time has come for opening up generally for women 
in the armed forces said defense minister bernt collet 
the action was in keeping with a government policy of moving 
toward full equality in all fields collet said in a statement 
in principle equality applies throughout the military but a 
final decision on allowing women to train as f16 jet fighter 
pilots depends on the results of continuing medical 
investigations collet said 
so far no country allows servicewomen to fly supersonic f16s 
defense authorities did not say whether women would enter combat 
but it appeared they would do so under new policy 
the minister stressed that admittance and education reqirements 
in the military will be the same for men and women 
we cannot compromise with respect to the units combat 
readiness and efficiency the statement said therefore 
everybody regardless of sex must fulfil requirments set by the 
different branches

a group of 42 striking construction 
workers and car mechanics ended their 10day fast thursday after 
the sandinista government agreed to negotiations next week union 
leader alejandro solarsano said 
solarsano a leader of the general workers federation said the 
fast for higher wages was a success because it restored dignity 
to workers 
the group began a hunger strike at federation headquarters on 
april 25 to back a strike that began feb 25 and is supported by 
4500 workers according to the union 
rolando velasquez the federations secretary of labor relations 
and one of the hunger strikers said the construction workers and 
auto mechanics would continue their walkout 
the hunger strike is suspended but the work stoppage will 
continue until the demands of the working class are obtained he 
said 
the federation groups socialist unions the fast has been a 
particular irritation to a leftist government that considers itself 
in the vanguard of workers rights 
sandinista police diverted traffic from a fourlane highway at 
the site of the federation headquarters the strikers filed out and 
were loaded into civilian cars some held their arms above their 
heads 
police barred journalists from approaching and roughly pushed a 
tv crew 
solarsano said four of the hunger strikers were taken to a 
hospital for treatment 
labor activist nilo salazar said 42 workers took part in the 
fast 
federation director carlos salgado told reporters thursday the 
deteriorating physical condition of the hunger strikers was a 
factor in calling off the fast he said the government cut off 
water supplies to federation headquarters and kept relatives from 
bringing medical supplies inside 
police have detained more than 70 people since the hunger strike 
began 
the interior ministry shut down news shows for eight days on two 
private radio stations for broadcasting what it said was false 
information a third station was shut down completely for 24 hours 
but allowed to reopen thursday 
also on thursday the foreign ministry said a cia center based 
in neighboring costa rica provided false documents to sully the 
nicaraguan governments image 
it has been increasing in direct relation to the negotiation 
process with nicaraguan rebels alejandro bendanda the 
ministrys secretarygeneral told a news conference 
he blamed the reagan administration saying the line is to 
prove negotiations have not produced results 
the sandinistas have been trying to work out a definitive 
ceasefire agreement with the usbacked rebels known as contras 
an agreement between the two sides was signed march 23 shortly 
after the us congress voted down additional military aid for the 
rebels 
the contras have fought the sandinista government since late 
1981 two years after it came to power in a revolution that ended 
42 years of rule by the rightist proamerican somoza dynasty 
bendana said the cia documentation center was in san jose the 
costa rican capital and was uncovered by an interior ministry 
investigation he declined to elaborate 
he said at least eight false documents surfaced recently and 
said they were an attempt to rob the government of credibility 
in san jose a person answering the phone at the costa rican 
governments organization of judicial investigation said the agency 
knew nothing of any such activity the person refused to give a 
name

fire broke out late thursday in the capitol 
hill office of house speaker jim wright dtexas and the blaze 
raged unimpeded for 10 minutes due to a lack of fire hoses and 
alarms says a congressman who was one of the first at the scene 
two us capitol police officers were treated for smoke 
inhalation at the scene but they did not require further medical 
attention said officer dan nichols 
the fire in wrights secondfloor corner office of the longworth 
building across the street from the capitol was caused by an 
electrical problem said district of columbia deputy fire chief 
jamelia jackson he estimated the damages at 120000 and said the 
offices will need extensive restoration 
rep curt weldon rpa whose offices are next door to 
wrights said the fire was able to spread for at least 10 minutes 
after it broke out shortly after 6 pm because fire hoses which 
are supposed to be in emergency cabinets throughout the building 
were missing 
im totally frustrated by a congressional building that has no 
fire alarms and absolutely no fire hoses in the standpipe 
cabinets said weldon who is a former fire chief 
wed have had the fire out we knew where it was we were in 
there and we just couldnt get to it he told reporters on the 
sidewalk outside his shirt smudged with soot i guarantee you 
ill raise cain about it the next time were in session which i 
guess is monday 
the house had adjourned for the weekend a short time before the 
fire erupted 
weldon said he and some capitol police officers smelled smoke 
and ran to wrights office where they found the fire just starting 
in a kitchen area and climbing one wall they tried to use small 
drychemical fire extinguishers which were just no good he 
said 
there is no alarm system in the sevenstory building so guards 
had to be sent running down hallways to evacuate congressional 
offices weldon said when district of columbia firefighters 
arrived they had to drag hoses up to the second floor to get water 
on the blaze he added 
and this is supposedly the nations capitol were going to 
have some heads spinning next week weldon said 
rep jim kolbe rariz was forced onto the sidewalk in the 
rain dressed in a tuxedo a party he had been holding in the 
building to pay off a bet on the ncaa basketball tournament had 
been interrupted by the fire 
i dont think anybody was upset a fire is a fire you gotta 
get out kolbe said nobody had even gotten any food we had to 
leave all the food there 
the speakers office is pretty much burned out theres a lot 
of heat damage said weldon that whole corner is going to have 
to be redone 
wrights primary office as house speaker is in the capitol 
building the office where the fire occurred primarily handles his 
congressional district business 
weldon said he had just formed a congressional fire caucus a 
group of members concerned about fire prevention issues three 
months ago because america doesnt have a fire policy 
he pointed to a rocketfuel plant explosion in nevada a fire in 
a los angeles highrise and the capitol hill incident all in the 
past two days as the best examples you could have of the need 
for such a policy

the state supreme court on thursday allowed 
the california coastal commission to require an exclusive los 
angeles club to take an antidiscrimination pledge in exchange for 
permission to develop beach property 
the jonathan club admitted its first black and female members 
last summer and said in court papers it does not discriminate in 
its membership practices 
however the club has refused to comply with a coastal 
commission requirement of declaring a nondiscrimination policy in 
order to receive a permit to expand its santa monica facilities 
part of the land the club occupies is leased from the state 
the supreme court refused a hearing on an appeal by the club of 
a lowercourt ruling in the coastal commissions favor 
however the high court unanimously withdrew the ruling as a 
precedent for other decisions leaving the scope of the 
commissions power unclear 
attorney john shiner said the club had not decided whether to 
appeal 
deputy attorney general anthony summers the commissions 
lawyer said club officials publicly stated their policy for the 
first time in their court papers 
it seems to me that if they were willing to tell the 
commission the same thing they would be complying he said 
that misses the point countered shiner the coastal 
commission lacks the authority and the jurisdiction to impose a 
condition of this sort on any applicant 
in his court papers shiner said the commission was seeking 
the power to intrude into the private affairs of every citizen of 
this state 
the case illustrates how perfectly wellintentioned persons 
who are seeking to remedy a social evil may develop a witchhunt 
vigilante approach shiner wrote 
the club wants to build new paddle tennis courts and a parking 
lot all restricted to members only on 122000 square feet of 
santa monica beach property 58000 square feet of which are on 
lots leased from the state 
the leases do not contain antidiscrimination clauses but when 
the club applied for a development permit in 1985 the commission 
said it would require a written promise not to discriminate against 
minorities or women 
the club refused saying its membership policies were irrelevant 
to the issue but a superior court judge ruled in the commissions 
favor and was upheld in january by a state appeals court

group holding 13 foreigners and colombians attacked an eastern 
border town before dawn thursday and battled with police for four 
hours officials said 
one officer was killed and four were wounded in the attack on 
salazar de las palmas a town of 15000 by about 60 members of the 
national liberation army police said 
the guerrillas said in a news release that the hostages 
captured monday and tuesday in various colombian cities were in no 
danger and will be released by weeks end with an important 
message the captives include two west germans two swiss men and a 
frenchman 
in the statement delivered wednesday at the medellin home of 
west german honorary consul helmut luecker one of the captives 
the group said the hostages were held in the new colombia camp 
in northeastern colombia 
the news release a glossy pamphlet in spanish german and 
french was delivered in an envelope with lueckers car keys other 
copies were delivered to news media organizations in bogota and 
bucaramanga 
the release said european countries should make their 
positions known about the dirty war that sweeps our country today 
and demand that the colombian government stop the genocidal 
practices this was an apparent reference to recent killings of 
peasants in several areas of the country in which 122 people have 
been killed in less than two months 
police said thursday they had no clues they identified the 
abducted foreigners as sigfried markert and luecker the west 
german honorary consuls in bucaramanga and medellin jean 
christophe rampal a press attache at the french embassy in bogota 
and richard aufereggen and wilfred lehner two swiss nationals 
working for the colombianswiss chamber of commerce in bogota 
the guerrillas were also holding eight colombians including 
journalists and the president of the santander state assembly and 
two politicians of that city 
the news release signed by roman catholic priest manuel perez 
head of the guerrilla group said the purpose of the abductions was 
to denounce that the colombian oligarchy has surrendered the 
best of the country its natural resources and the national 
sovereignty to american imperialism 
the group says the colombian government has placed its oil 
resources in the hands of usbased occidental petroleum which 
has a 15 percent stake in a 2billionbarrel oil deposit in eastern 
colombia 
ecopetrol the state oil company owns 60 percent anglodutch 
shell oil 20 percent and a spanish company 5 percent

have staged 22 attacks against an oil pipeline with a capacity of 
215000 barrels per day it runs from the cano limon fields near 
the venezuelan border to the caribbean port town of covenas

riot squads stormed a steel mill in 
southern poland on thursday on the 10th day of a walkout but 
workers vowed to continue their strike 
in gdansk thousands of police surrounded a shipyard in a tense 
standoff with defiant strikers solidarity chief lech walesa said 
he would be the last to leave if police tried to crush the 
strike at the lenin shipyard in the baltic port city 
at the huge nowa huta steel mill in krakow riot police rousted 
sleeping steelworkers hurled deafening percussion grenades and 
rounded up 38 people 
the government denied there were injuries but opposition 
spokesmen said that strikers were beaten and that at least 32 
required treatment including a man with two broken legs 
strikers said a protest against the raid was held on the 
steelworks grounds after the police left and many workers refused 
to return to their jobs 
the strike committee in its first statement after the raid 
called on workers to stay home in protest 
the brutal actions by the zomos riot police and the sb 
secret police did not break our strike the statement said 
strike committee sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said andrzej szewczuwaniec chairman of the 16member committee 
escaped along with five other members the rest were detained 
at the lenin shipyard chants of solidarity solidarity 
could be heard inside the steelyard 
the moment of the solution similar to that at nowa huta is 
approaching walesa said in a taped interview smuggled out of the 
yard 
shortly before midnight police convoys moved about gdansk in 
an apparent show of force 
hours before at 630 pm a note smuggled out of the shipyard 
by the strikers said as far as we know they the authorities 
are preparing for a police raid it said civil defense troops 
were already in the yard and secret police functionaries were 
in the management building 
as officials cracked down on the two major strikes other work 
stoppages were reported in polands worst wave of labor unrest 
since the military declared martial law in 1981 
strikes and protests were reported among bus drivers in the 
northwestern cities of szczecin and police students in warsaw and 
gdansk and shipworkers in gdynia near gdansk 
riot squads stormed nowa huta just one day after roman catholic 
church mediators had persuaded plant directors to negotiate with 
the strikers 
government spokesman jerzy urban told a news conference that the 
decision to storm the steel mill was inevitable 
the majority wanted to work we must protect our meager 
economic potential he said 
this was a normal restoring of order when the law was being 
violated he said 
recent events proved that walesa and his followers want to 
evoke crisis and a confrontation urban said and the 
government has not does not and shall not talk with such 
people 
police entered the strike center in the steelworks pressing 
department at 2 am only hours after the strike committee which 
said it represented 15000 of the 32000 employees was told it 
would have its first talks in a week with management 
the police set off percussion grenades terrorizing the 
paralyzed defenseless and sleeping people said krzystof 
kozlowski a senior roman catholic journalist in krakow 
the rev tadeusz zaleski was with the strikers at the time of 
the raid and was turned over to church officials 
the riot police were beating people with very long heavy 
sticks he said some people were chased and beaten the riot 
police were very brutal and on many occasions beat people who 
already had been caught 
most strike committee members were detained immediately later 
special riot police entered and ordered all strikers to leave 
the whole thing took place without one bruise urban said in 
a telephone interview nobody suffered any harm or injury 
but zygmunt lenyk of the conservative opposition group 
confederation of independent poland said 32 people suffered cuts 
eight people were left unconscious and one man had two legs broken 
the staterun news agency pap said some plant departments 
resumed work thursday while others remained idle for maintenance 
but workers emerging from nowa huta at thursday afternoon said 
some people inside had resumed striking pap reported that 
absenteeism at the plant was 30 percent to 40 percent 
in gdansk the area around the lenin shipyard was cordoned off 
by thousands of police the shipyard went on strike monday the 
fourth strike since april 25 
walesa joined the strikers and has remained in the plant since 
wednesday 
once again the possibility of logical and necessary solutions 
are being ruined walesa said in the taped statements they are 
sinking our country into ruin this is unnecessary they are unable 
to do it otherwise 
he continued its certainly obvious that ill be the last to 
leave 
the strike committee led by veteran worker alojzy szablewski 
issued a communique that the strike was still on 
the events dominated staterun radio and television newscasts 
solidarity born in a historic strike at the gdansk shipyard in 
august 1980 says its banning 16 months later after the 
introduction of martial law was unjust and that it wants dialogue 
with the authorities 
police kept up pressure on opposition activists around the 
country among those reported detained with solidarity national 
spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz wroclaw solidarity leader jozef 
pinior and gdansk area solidarity activist andrzej gwiazda phones 
to opposition activists were also cut off

the united methodists on thursday narrowly 
voted in favor of a boycott of royal dutch shell petroleum parent 
company of shell oil usa to protest its business dealings in 
racially segregated south africa 
on vote of 475 to 418 the denominations governing body 
endorsed a resolution urging methodists to refrain from buying 
shell products 
the vote at the 96million member denominations conference 
came after a sharp debate in which several blacks pushed for the 
move and two texas delegates argued against it saying shell is 
using its influence to end apartheid 
numerous protestant and catholic groups below denominational 
level and labor organizations previously have called for such a 
boycott as has the unitarian association a relatively small 
denomination 
in october the 17million member united church of christ 
became the first major protestant denomination to join in urging a 
boycott 
the american subsidiary has emphasized it has no operations in 
south africa and that it and royal dutch shell firmly oppose 
apartheid 
in a statement thursday shell expressed disappointment with the 
vote by the nearly 1000 methodist delegates saying those who will 
be hardest hit are the innocent american service station owners 
and jobbers who sell shell products 
delegates also urged the use of full moral and corporate 
resources to end south africas system of racial apartheid but 
stopped short of an outright call for complete disengagements of 
companies and banks doing business there 
the delegates at the 11day conference running through friday 
noted that there is disagreement over such methods 
the boycott is part of a campaign endorsed by such groups as the 
united mine workers the aflcio the national association for the 
advancement of colored people

the headline in usa today could read 
proud prairie people pounce on polyester pundit

the polyester wars began tuesday when usa today wrote a story 
about cliffs notes those yellowandblack booklets explaining 
literary classics that have been a boon to untold legions of high 
school and college students the company that puts out cliffs 
notes is based in this town of 172000 
some might call this birthplace of cliffs notes the edge of

polyester wrote the reporter karen s peterson 
in mock retaliation scott young cohost of kfor radios 
morning show urged lincolnites to participate in the plethora of 
polyester pileup the plan was to send peterson pounds and 
pounds of polyester

one of three men who kidnapped 
and buried a busload of chowchilla schoolchildren in 1976 was 
denied parole a ninth time thursday 
the threemember state board of prison terms panel voted 
unanimously to keep richard schoenfeld 33 in central mens prison 
here for his role in the abduction of the 26 children and their bus 
driver in 1976 
alameda county assistant district attorney don whyte had argued 
that continued imprisonment would be a deterrent to others 
i have no doubt in my mind that mr schoenfeld would not 
commit an offense like this if released said whyte but im 
not sure there arent others lurking around who might 
the panel agreed schoenfeld poses an unreasonable risk of 
danger to society 
schoenfeld along with his brother james and frederick n woods 
are serving life sentences for abducting the bus at gunpoint from 
rural madera county about 150 miles southeast of san francisco the 
men shut the victims in a poorly ventilated moving van buried in a 
quarry about 100 miles away in livermore 
it took the captives 16 hours to dig their way through the 
woodand earthcovered hole to safety 
karen snell schoenfelds attorney said he will seek parole

retired chicago bears running back 
walter payton the alltime career rushing leader of the nfl says 
car racing takes total concentration skill and finesse just like 
football does 
racing is so mental payton said its exactly like 
football you have to be concentrating on every down in racing 
you have to be concentrating on every lap 
when youre out on the track youre not only competing for a 
fast lap but youre competing against the other guy he said 
besides i love to go fast 
payton who retired from the nfl after last season took part in 
a driving school at the fourmile road america sports car racing 
course here and it was his third driving school in six weeks 
as for the interest in car racing he told the milwaukee 
sentinel that was nothing new 
ive always been interested in racing payton said ever 
since i was a kid and looked under the hood of my dads car its 
just the natural thing 
i thought about racing motorcycles about four or five years 
ago but then that was impossible he said about three years 
ago i thought about racing sports cars when i retired from 
football 
in the training sessions here he took the classroom studies as 
required in a formula ford 
during break times he got some practice in his own sport 2000 
racer 
payton said he hopes to return to the road america course to 
compete in the june sprints and he can feel his improvement as a 
driver

police arrested 401 antiabortion 
demonstrators outside a gynecological service thursday but the 
district attorney said he does not want to prosecute because he 
feels they did no wrong 
i do feel very strongly that when one trespasses at an 
abortion clinic in a peaceful and nonviolent way they are doing 
so to save lives said nassau county district attorney denis 
dillon 
dillon said he was asking a nassau county administrative judge 
to appoint a special district attorney to handle the arrests 
the demonstrators from operation rescue were accused of blocking 
the entrance to the clinic they were charged with disorderly 
conduct and released said officer peter lambert a nassau county 
police spokesman 
you can use the analogy of someone trespassing on private 
property to save the life of someone being strangled the 
trespassing becomes relatively unimportant in that case in my 
view dillon said 
a federal judge on wednesday had continued an order prohibiting 
operation rescue and its director randall terry from blocking 
entrances to abortion clinics 
us district judge robert j ward had threatened 25000aday 
fines that would be turned over to the national organization for 
women 
however city attorney lorna bade goodman said it was unclear 
whether the fines could be levied because terry apparently had not 
been served with the order prior to the protest in this new york 
suburb 
demonstrations by operation rescue on monday and tuesday in new 
york city resulted in hundreds of arrests

a federal appeals court ruled wednesday 
that private unionized employees cant use state privacy laws to 
challenge drug testing allowing random screening to resume at the 
san onofre nuclear power plant 
the san onofre workers can fight a company testing program only 
by claiming a violation of their contract through national labor 
relations board grievance procedures said the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals in a 30 decision 
the court rejected arguments by the 850 workers that the privacy 
rights involved in drug testing are so fundamental that they cannot 
be negotiated away union contracts often authorize employers to 
search workers possessions the panel noted 
in the san onofre case the union contract did not mention drug 
testing but the company has interpreted it as allowing such a 
program 
the union has asked the nlrb to review the dispute but in a 
case where a contract expressly authorized drug testing 
wednesdays ruling would appear to leave workers without recourse 
im quite dismayed said attorney john true of the 
employment law center a legal aid office whose clients include 
workers challenging drug testing 
the rulings scope is limited to unionized workers in 
california since nonunion workers still could invoke the right to 
privacy against a private employer under the state constitution 
southern california edison co the operator of san onofre 
praised the ruling saying in a statement that unannounced 
testing is legal and appropriate under the circumstances to protect 
the public health and safety 
although the suit had been filed only on behalf of 850 union 
members edison spokesman lou phelps said the company had halted 
testing of a total of 2000 to 3000 workers including nonunion 
employees

throughout the week investors awaited the 
latest report on employment confident that in these numbers there 
would be a signal of where the economy is headed 
if todays report was strong it would indicate to investors 
that they had better beware of inflation if inflation arose 
wouldnt higher interest rates certainly follow and wouldnt that 
be bad for stocks 
if employment didnt rise strongly or if unemployment didnt 
shrink the report might signify resiliency investors might view 
inflation and higher interest rates as more distant and that would 
be good for the markets 
but all that concern may be wasted because employment reports 
tell us only where we have been not where we are going that at 
least is how they have been viewed for years and years 
why then the interest in the job data 
because it seems the securities markets are looking for any 
hard news to give them direction and the employment report seems 
to have been the latest cue available even if it is not a leading 
indicator 
latest however is not always best or even good as albert cox 
jr points out cox a former merrill lynch economist and now 
economic adviser to other firms points out there are some older 
indicators available to investors 
some of these indicators have been on record since before the 
oct 19 debacle in the securities markets based on historical 
experience they all remain pertinent and all of them have 
something to say about the 1988 economy 
the first of these is the index of leading economic indicators 
which has an average lead time or forecast term of about 11 
months it reached a peak last august thus it implies a peak in 
the economy for around july 1988 
stock prices themselves are an indicator peaks or valleys in 
the market generally are followed by economic change about 10 
months later stock prices peaked last august that would indicate 
an economic peak this june 
the length of the manufacturing workweek is another arrow into 
the future on average it gives about 11 months notice it peaked 
last october which suggests the economic expansion will reach its 
peak in september 
unemployment claims are another leading indicator giving on 
average about 14 months notice of economic changes to follow this 
indicator also peaked in october suggesting that the economy 
itself will peak this christmas 
changes in housing permits have one of the longest lead times of 
any indicator averaging about 16 months they peaked way back in 
december 1986 if accurate they indicate the economy is even now 
descending from its peak 
none of these indicators is infallible all are subject to 
various human misconceptions and miscalculations that go into them 
they have failed in the past they seem to have worked in the past 
they are only indications 
but as cox views them their arrows all suggest that we are in 
what he calls the recession zone and that we will remain in 
that zone until the fall 
while acknowledging the direction of the needles however he 
observes that such indicators are good only as long as they last 
that is they have meaning until they are made meaningless by new 
statistical peaks and valleys 
so far they have not been made meaningless except in the eyes 
of some investors 
oddly these investors choose to ignore them and instead seize 
the latest set of numbers out of washington even if those numbers 
tell them where they have been economically speaking rather than 
where they are headed

mario van peebles was an economics student he 
dealt in limited partnerships in films and worked as a new york 
city budget official but he wanted to be a star and he went to 
his father for help 
he got advice nothing more 
i think it was hip that my dad let me do it myself because if 
i couldnt then i shouldnt be here said van peebles star of 
nbctvs detectivecomedy series sonny spoon 
his father is melvin van peebles the authorproducerdirector 
who created the controversial movie sweet sweetbacks baadasssss 
song broadways aint supposed to die a natural death and 
waltz of the stork 
the elder van peebles never interceded on the behalf of his son 
except to caution show biz is a business learn that business 
side 
so he took the tortuous route to stardom from columbia 
university to wall street to city hall and finally to broadway and 
hollywood 
following small parts on stage and in the movies van peebles 
appeared in the play waltz of the stork his film appearances 
include heartbreak ridge jaws the revenge exterminator 
ii and the cotton club he also has appeared on the cosby 
show la law and the daytime soap opera one life to 
live 
having a famous father helps van peebles said 
but if you dont have the talent to stay there theyll slam 
the door on your foot he said theyre not going to give you a 
lead in a show based on who your dad is and people are not going to 
watch you 
mario van peebles was born in mexico city he his father and 
mother maria traveled and lived throughout europe for eight years 
before settling in san francisco the time in europe served him 
well 
i learned a lot of accents like that he said i speak a 
little french i speak a little spanish a little uptown a little 
downtown it helps me a lot now in my work 
his character on sonny spoon is a streetwise detective who 
regularly slips into other characters a japanese chef an old fat 
man a frenchman a church woman an attorney to get the job done 
van peebles finds that having the ability to change characters 
helped prevent him from being typecast 
when i first came to la los angeles people sort of said 
youre a young harry belafonte youre going to play black 
leading men which sort of meant unemployment if you missed a 
soldiers story he said referring to the critically acclaimed 
film and play 
the actor decries the lack of film and tv roles for blacks and 
other minorities you have to understand whatever you look 
like whether youre fat with red hair you have to deal with that 
its hard 
this is the deal the bottom line is the golden rule he who 
has the gold rules he said so just get in there do your own 
show and shut up have a handle on how youre presented if you 
can 
van peebles said blacks have been supportive of sonny spoons 
a lot of people have come up to me and said are you worried 
because youre doing a show and theres no hour show where a tan 
guy like yourself is in the lead 
maybe i would feel more pressured if i didnt feel i was 
showing a positive image or they black community didnt seem to 
feel it or we didnt seem to feel that we were showing a positive 
image 
i insisted the cops and villains be mixed races so we break 
away from this silly color stuff i want a human show if i have a 
black show ive lost he said 
van peebles said his ultimate goal is to become a filmmaker he 
is working on a feature film he wrote and coproduced with his 
father called identity crisis he stars and his father directs 
my dad once said you got two loves in your life who youre 
with and what youre doing im working with my dad and people i 
love and care about im doing what i like doing van peebles 
said 
its funny he said i remember people used to say the 
only reason you got the job is because of your daddy and now 
they say the only reason your dad got the job is because of 
you so it all comes around you just have to laugh on it on both 
sides and do your thing

the actors yves montand likes are the kind of 
actor he is himself 
i admire sean connery very much he said i like columbo 
peter falk i like this kind of actors who become older but they 
dont lose their youth really they go on with some charm and are 
human beings they dont destroy themselves with face lifts which 
are terrible 
montand was recently in new york to receive this years tribute 
from the film society of lincoln center the 17th person to be 
honored and the first frenchman his two most recent films are 
jean de florette which won the british film academys prize 
for best picture and manon of the spring in both he portrays 
a farming village patriarch cesar soubeyran 
the reason i didnt want to make the movies was not because i 
look 20 years older said the 66yearold montand i said let 
the years do their job it was because i wanted to go on tour 
montand started as a singer was discovered by the legendary 
edith piaf made his first movie with her in 1945 and sang on stage 
and made movies until 1968 when he decided to concentrate on film 
acting in 1982 he made a world singing tour which was a smash 
success and planned to repeat in 1984 but made the two movies 
instead 
i think it is a very good story based on a wonderful book 
marcel pagnols leau des colines but it was courageous to 
make this kind of part contrary to what people wait for from you 
he is a nasty man he could be very cruel in some ways he said 
montand and actress simone signoret who were married from 1950 
until her death in 1985 used to read each others movie scripts 
sometimes she would say youre going to shoot this thing it 
is awful i would say youre right but i promised this young 
director of course the movie is a flop he recalled 
sometimes you fall in love with a story youre reading if a 
director has good taste he puts you in his pocket 
montand has advice about getting older humor tenderness and 
lucidity cannot change and are important in life as you become 
older you need to laugh have a sense of humor first of all 
against yourself everybody needs tenderness tenderness cannot 
become old never and if you are clear this is right this is 
not right you stay a young man or woman 
im going to look a little pompous now but i say never never 
stop working with your memory you remember a girl what is her 
name you say it isnt important forget it no no make the 
effort to discover again the name of this girl even if it is not 
important this is exercise like for the muscles 
for physical exercise montand walks four or five miles every 
day when he can sometimes i make a seven or 10minute dance in 
the morning then i take a shower and thats it 
at the tribute french filmmaker louis malle called montand 
one of the most romantic figures the french cinema has ever 
known 
montand however still hasnt figured out romance i 
remembered this morning lying in bed the first time a girl kissed 
me or i kissed her i didnt like it two months later someone 
else comes you collapse both are very nice looking its very 
peculiar 
when you are an adult it is a mystery you love me i love 
you its the only thing you can say you are mad its 
unbelievable its a volcano inside what does it mean we can 
understand nothing death love we dont know anything about 
maybe its better i dont know its a wonderful mystery anyway 
thank god 
during the interview in montands suite in hotel maxims the 
telephone rang several times and a film society representative 
spoke to women who wished to stop by im sure it is only for 
autographs the actor said with a charming smile 
since jean de florette and manon of the spring montand 
has done a few tv appearances he plans a tv version about alfred 
dreyfus the french army officer who was convicted for treason but 
later found to be the victim of antisemitism he also plans to do 
a movie about terrorists 
montands next movie though will be a musical three seats 
for the 26th directed by jacques demy with music by michel 
legrand who collaborated on the umbrellas of cherbourg 
i dont want to tell you the story i want it to be a 
surprise he said it will not be a beautiful masterpiece as 
made by gene kelly or fred astaire

habib bourguibas statue still dominates a 
square in central tunis but the man who towered over tunisia for 
32 years has slipped into oblivion six months after his ouster 
his successor as president zine el abidine ben ali has 
proclaimed a new era for the north african nation appealing to 
the nations islamic and arabic heritage a stand that has won him 
immediate widespread support 
bourguiba who had set the nation on a western course after he 
won independence from france in 1956 now is 84 years old and 
confined to a chateau outside tunis he was declared no longer 
capable of governing when he was removed from office nov 7 
ben ali took power during a tense crackdown on islamic 
fundamentalists and is universally credited even by political 
opponents with sparing the nation from a more serious upheaval 
he has sought to make peace with the islamic fundamentalists and 
others in the bourguiba opposition 
newspapers once banned by bourguiba are back on newsstands many 
people say they no longer fear the police tunis university 
disrupted three days a week last year by demonstrations is quiet 
about 5000 prisoners many of them members of an outlawed 
islamic fundamentalist group have been pardoned 
the national legislature dominated by bourguibas ruling party 
since tunisias independence in 1956 has moved toward pluralism 
with a new law on political parties 
in his most risky move however ben ali has extended a hand to 
the growing islamic fundamentalist movement bourguibas chief 
target in his waning years 
television and radio now broadcast the five daily calls to 
islamic prayer 
islam has alway been the official state religion but bourguiba 
maintained a secular character in government and daily life 
ben ali a military man once in charge of the crackdown on 
fundamentalists invokes allah god at the start of his speeches 
its life thats changed not just politics said chakib 
douss a brassware merchant in the tunis bazaar now everyone is 
free we feel it every day every minute its not something you 
read about in the newspaper its something you touch 
many in the opposition approved of the new climate if only for 
now 
incontestably nov 7 was a comfort to everyone said a 
leading member of the socialist democrat movement the largest 
opposition party speaking on condition of anonymity 
its still the honeymoon so everyone feels obliged to 
publicly approve him commented mhamed jaibi editorinchief of 
the weekly maghreb reopened in september after being shut down 
four years ago 
i hope this is a temporary situation he said of ben alis 
popularity otherwise well be back in the old system with a 
president who thinks he is infallible 
that was an allusion as well to bourguiba who had become so 
dominant that he was declared presidentforlife a benign dictator 
in charge of a nominal democracy his destourian socialist party 
controlled all seats in the national assembly none of the three 
legal opposition parties had a meaningful voice 
but ben ali has promised that his new era would open the 
horizons to a truly democratic and evolved political life 
since taking office he has moved to abolish the lifelong 
presidency change the electoral code and press laws dismantle the 
feared state security court and given amnesty international the 
londonbased human rights group a permit to operate here its 
first in the arab world 
ben ali has also restored diplomatic relations with neighboring 
libya and stresses closer ties with the arab world 
while citizens appear won over by the changes some opposition 
politicians remain cautious and fundamentalists are reserving full 
judgment 
the final year of bourguibas leadership was marked by a battle 
against the fundamentalist islamic tendency movement culminating 
in a trial in september of 90 fundamentalists on charges of 
plotting against the state 
the islamic dossier remains the hottest one on ben alis 
desk said hassen ghodhbani an islamic lawyer who defended some 
of the 90 in the trial 
he contended the measures taken by ben ali remain insufficient 
islam isnt just prayer and pilgrimage its an entire life 
system he said 
in late april the legislature quashed any hopes that the 
islamic tendency movement might become a legal opposition party 
one of its demands a new law allowed new political parties but 
forbade those based on religion language race or region 
the government has adopted a double attitude toward islam 
said the opposition politician who spoke anonymously 
it is a position both clever and dangerous

the specter of drought hovers over both sides 
of america and climate experts fear that recent rains wont be 
enough to alleviate the dryness 
while some rain has fallen along the pacific coast and parts of 
the southeast in recent days both areas remain dry 
its one of these very elusive things right now we are 
getting rains so were keeping our fingers crossed commented 
paul sabol of the federal climate analysis center 
if this summer brings drought it will fit into a decade that 
has been more often dry than wet 
indeed a look back at weather records since 1980 shows only 
1982 with no serious drought areas 
much of the southeast is 12 percent below normal in rainfall in 
this decade the equivalent of a year without rain some parts of 
georgia are 70 inches below normal according to water resources 
officials in that state 
across the country dryness has prompted water rationing in san 
francisco and may threaten crops in washington oregon and idaho 
the agriculture department has established a task force to 
monitor conditions in both regions 
northern california is experiencing its worst water shortage in 
11 years and farmers businesses and residents have been asked to 
cut back on water use some water districts have adopted rationing 
san franciscans have been told to cut consumption by 25 percent 
in oakland some residents are protesting a plan to limit water use 
and significantly raise fees for households exceeding the 
allocation 
this winters precipitation was normal or even above normal 
until the end of january said gary barbato a hydrologist with the 
us weather service at san francisco international airport but 
february and march of this year were dismal droughtproducing 
months 
officials say the dryness in california isnt as bad as 197677 
when rainfall was only 25 percent of normal 
in nevada the drought is still on with a passion said the 
states climatologist john james who chairs a committee 
considering both longrange and shortrange measures to alleviate 
the problem 
farmers are not the only ones affected by drought forest fires 
reduced hydroelectric output and increased river and stream 
pollution also can be blamed on the dryness 
back in november people were beginning to become concerned 
again about the pacific northwest said tom ross of the us 
geological survey 
that region suffered a drought last year which extended into 
the normally wet winter season 
rivers and streams in the northwest were 35 percent below normal 
in march according to a study by the us geological survey in 
the southeast streamflows were 54 percent of normal for the month 
record low flows were recorded at 11 streams in the southeast and 
two in the northwest 
thomas heddingshaus of the federal agricultural weather center 
said that despite recent coastal rains the interior of eastern 
washington and southwestern idaho remain very dry in addition to 
california the center is operated jointly by the national oceanic 
and atmospheric administration and the department of agriculture 
in the southeast many regional reservoirs are even lower than 
they were at this date in 1986 preceeding the drought of that 
summer ross said 
rainfall in parts of north carolina and tennessee measured as 
little as 25 percent of normal in the first three months of this 
year according to ross and problem areas extended into virginia 
south carolina georgia and alabama 
the 1986 drought stemmed from a shift in the jet stream the 
strong upper atmosphere wind that tends to move weather from place 
to place said heddingshaus 
in normal weather the jet dips south over the mississippi 
valley and then turns back to the north again pulling along 
moisture from the gulf of mexico to water the southeast 
in 1986 the jet stream dip occurred farther east with the 
result that the return movement north missed the southeast he said 
elsewhere in america portions of central and northern minnesota 
also could be vulnerable to drought even with normal rainfall 
through the summer according to state climatologist jim zandlo 
researchers set odds at from 21 to 31 in favor of a drought in 
those areas this summer zandlo said 
its almost like you saw in the typical 1930s scenes where 
clouds of dust are moving across the fields said fred kollman 
district conservationist for the soil conservation service in 
norman county you see drifts of dirt almost like snowdrifts in 
the road ditches there is lots of dirt in the air and lots of dirt 
in the houses 
here is a yearbyyear outlook at dryness in this decade 
1980 
hot and dry summer from the missouri valley throughout the 
southeastern states rainfall was 25 percent to 50 percent of 
normal across much of the nation the heat wave has been blamed for 
as many as 1200 deaths and crop and livestock damage estimated at 
20 billion 
dryness records were reported in parts of texas kansas 
wyoming arkansas and virginia 
1981 
much of the nation remained in the grip of the drought which 
began in 1980 light winter snowfall meant that groundwater was not 
recharged and municipal water supplies in the northeast slipped to 
dangerously low levels 
rains starting in may brought relief to some farm areas 
although abnormally dry weather continued in the northern great 
plains southeast and middle atlantic states 
1982 
there were no extensive areas of drought as cool canadian air 
helped produce active rain fronts during most of the summer 
1983 
searing heat struck in july and august producing severe drought 
east of the rockies 
the drought was similar to that of 1980 but centered slightly 
farther north in the western corn belt states corn and soybean 
crops were severely damaged and the dryness extended to the 
midatlantic region rain was less than onequarter of normal in 
parts of texas kansas oklahoma nebraska missouri iowa and 
illinois 
1984 
damage to wheat crops totaled more than 1 billion in montana 
and north dakota where rainfall was only onethird of normal in 
the first half of the year many brush fires were reported 
persistent dryness also damaged crops and grasslands in central 
texas 
1985 
dry conditions led to serious brush and forest fires in 
california and in the northern rockies and northern plains states 
1986 
virginia the carolinas georgia alabama and tennessee were hit 
by a drought that has been described as the worst in more than a 
century less than onequarter the normal rain fell in some areas 
some relief came in august when rains helped soybean crops but 
it was too late for hay and corn regional damage estimates topped 
1 billion 
1987 
forest fires scorched more than 2 million acres when a dry 
winter was followed by a sweltering summer in parts of idaho 
washington oregon and california water shortages occurred in 
spokane and some other communities 
hot dry conditions in july and august also contributed to 
drought conditions in the southeast reducing crop yields sharply 
heavy rains came along in september but excessively dry conditions 
returned to the southeast in october and november particularly 
affecting west virginia kentucky and tennessee

here in a milehigh valley called 
paradise a religious group is building its home a retreat for 
thousands that some local people say threatens the pristine 
environment bordering yellowstone national park 
the group is the church universal and triumphant a new age 
sect that moved its headquarters in late 1986 from california to a 
12000acre ranch it had bought five years earlier in southwest 
montanas paradise valley 
with that move came 200 followers doubling the number already 
there construction plans for a selfsufficient community and the 
promise of more church members moving into a valley with a 
population of about 1000 
next door is yellowstone whose wildlife herds often migrate 
into the valley during the winter 
this is a place of international significance says hank 
rate a local resident if they do what they say they want to do 
that value is going to be diminished not only for our time but 
for all time 
rate and others fear the groups building plans and its summer 
conclaves that attract thousands will cause environmental damage in 
the valley 
some critics say theyre uncomfortable with the groups beliefs 
the church was founded 30 years ago in washington dc by mark 
prophet who said he received messages from spiritual figures of 
the past including christ buddha and pope john xxiii upon his 
death in 1973 his widow elizabeth clare prophet became the 
leader 
church members believe a human soul is continuously reincarnated 
until people realize the god within themselves they use praying or 
chanting to attempt to influence world conditions or personal 
concerns tobacco alcohol and drugs are forbidden 
ms prophet 47 says her visions suggest a war between the 
united states and the soviet union before the end of this century 
the church supports president reagans strategic defense initiative 
and a nationwide civil defense system 
we have a lot of downhome nice type of folks on this ranch 
who are just like the people that are our neighbors ms prophet 
says i dont think that all the hullaballoo thats been made in 
the press is the reality here 
critics draw comparisons between paradise valley and the tiny 
town of antelope ore taken over in the early 1980s and then 
abandoned by followers of the baghwan shree rajneesh 
church universal and triumphant bought some modular housing from 
the defunct rajneeshee community but church leaders say the 
similarities end there 
since the church bought the ranch in 1981 its leaders have hit 
the local rotary and kiwanis club circuit to calm fears that it is 
a farout religious cult bent on political control 
church vice president ed francis married to ms prophet says 
church members political persuasion generally resembles that of 
the area conservative and republican 
not everyone is reassured 
im concerned about the numbers says leonard sargent whose 
2000acre property borders the churchs royal teton ranch no 
matter what they happen to believe its still an awful lot of 
people to bring into a fragile area 
church officials counter that they chose the valley because of 
its natural beauty which they want to preserve 
the church bought the royal teton ranch in 1981 from magazine 
publisher malcolm forbes for a reported 7 million 
since then the church has purchased an additional 21500 acres 
in the paradise valley including 5200 acres of hilly prairie near 
emigrant intended for settlement by church members about 25 miles 
north of the royal teton ranch it also owns a printing shop in 
livingston that employs 100 people 
the church wont reveal its income but says it comes from 
members donations and various business ventures largely the sale 
of religious books and videotapes it also leases land to members 
the church has advertised the ranch to its members as a 
spiritual retreat offering protection from economic collapse civil 
disorder or war thousands of followers gather each summer for an 
annual conclave in a spectacular mountain valley called the heart 
of the inner retreat 
ms prophet and francis say the royal teton ranch will become a 
monastic selfsufficient community for 500 or so church members 
with the help of ranch staff church members who receive 
room board and small monthly salaries the church has installed 
an extensive irrigation system grows a wide variety of vegetables 
and grains operates a dairy and raises 2500 head of cattle and 
sheep 
members also began work in 1986 on the developments central 
complex located near the west bank of the yellowstone river 
several miles north of yellowstone park it would include housing 
for 260 a church school kitchen dining hall and recreation 
facilities 
but that work halted in november 1986 when the state prodded by 
local residents launched an environmental review 
a draft of the review completed in march said the project 
should be able to proceed without damaging wildlife water quality 
or aesthetics as long as the church takes several steps to cushion 
impact of the development the state found no threat to the 
environment that would justify denying sewage and water permits if 
the conditions were met 
following a public comment period we were overwhelmed with 
comment both for and against said steve pilcher chief of 
montanas water quality bureau the state is completing a final 
report 
the draft said the church should build a bearproof fence around 
a tree farm and vegetable fields monitor groundwater maintain 
minimum flows in three creeks crossing ranch property and postpone 
any use of a geothermal spring near the yellowstone river 
the church wants to pump water from laduke hot springs for use 
at its central complex park officials are concerned the pumping 
might affect mammoth hot springs nine miles to the south 
francis says the church is willing to accept the 
recommendations but a number of groups have suggested the state 
review is inadequate 
since the 1970s the church has occupied and later abandoned 
land in colorado idaho and california a series of steps to get 
here francis says adding that the church has no intention of 
moving again 
but critics say the church has not been forthcoming about its 
plans in the past 
basically ed francis credibility with me is zero says 
richard parks owner of an outdoor equipment shop in nearby 
gardiner and a member of the bear creek council a local 
environmental group if he told me it was thursday id check the 
calendar 
when church universal and triumphant bought the ranch francis 
said its rural nature would not be changed 
francis maintains he has been largely consistent i feel that 
a 1 percent use of property in this area for anything other than 
open space and wildlife is appropriate and not something that 
should cause a lot of alarm 
parks says the church changes the ambience of the whole 
area bringing the impact of a development but no direct economic 
benefits 
francis contends that whats really bothering the critics is 
simpler they just dont want others to have a piece of their 
paradise

the first impression of dodges new luxury 
fullsize sedan the 1988 dynasty le was of a refined dodge one 
better than the rest 
the exterior had some of the same styling of chryslers kcars 
but was updated with a nicely squaredoff trunk lid in the rear 
the interior on first glance seemed a comfortable mix of modern 
touches and familiar old gauges all with good quality 
unfortunately first impressions dont always hold up 
more than 300 miles after picking up the test car a few things 
had gone wrong the power antenna stuck midway through the test and 
wouldnt go up until i pulled off the highway and pried the antenna 
free with my fingernails 
the cigarette lighter didnt fit right and never popped back up 
once it was pushed down the temperature control lever fell out so 
heat could not be regulated in desperation one day i finally 
figured out a way to jam the lever back in and maneuver it along a 
horizontal axis to get some warmth 
the dashboard was admirably designed as one piece to prevent 
squeaks and rattles but in the test car it didnt seem to fit 
quite right though there were no squeaks a passenger noticed he 
could see right down to the underlying metal through a gap between 
the dash and window pillar 
and like chryslers kcars on which it is based the dynasty 
had a pentastar logo capped over the trunk keyhole that kept 
snapping back and pinching fingers as the trunk was opened 
the dynasty also had the characteristic kcar hole in the center 
of the trunk for a fullsized spare tire that without a tire 
there meant garment bags would fall inside in a rumpled heap 
the dynasty does have decent leg room in the rear a back seat 
that is comfortable and doesnt feel like a bench and a fine 
optional infinity ii sound system 767 
the exterior fit and finish was excellent and a standard 
feature that automatically locks all doors when the car is in gear 
and speed reaches more than 15 mph was startling at first but later 
comforting 
the optional electronic fuelinjected v6 660 performed 
smoothly 
additionally chrysler motors corp priced the car below many 
competitors the lowestpriced dynasty starts at 11666 compared 
with more than 14400 for an oldsmobile delta 88 and more than 
14000 for a pontiac bonneville 
that fits with chryslers plan to lure less affluent buyers 
median income of targeted dynasty buyers is 36000 compared with 
40000 annually for the average buyer in this market segment 
target dynasty buyers also are a bit younger age 55 compared 
with the average age of 61 in this market segment chrysler said 
seventy percent of the dynasty buyers are expected to be male 
chrysler said it introduced the dynasty in the 1988 model year to 
lure new buyers 
in a press release the automakers dodge division says the 
topoftheline dynasty will compete with oldsmobile delta 88 and 
pontiac bonneville for the younger more upscale and better 
educated buyer looking for uptotheminute technology in a 
traditionally styled family car 
but buyers of any age and income expect better quality than what 
was on the test car especially considering that with options the 
price came to 16700plus 
for that price the dynasty had best hold up under close 
inspection 
because the vehicle is new there are no reliability reports

deep in debt and scarred by scandal 
this ragged riverfront town has witnessed political brawls and 
street shootouts now its fighting again to survive 
too little money and too many problems have created what some 
say is the worst crisis ever in this long troubled city where 
crime and corruption are so common the mayor has 24hour bodyguards 
and excons have lined up for his job 
east st louis has garbage on its streets debts in the millions 
and bill collectors at its doors it also owes 41 million to a 
man who suffered brain damage after being beaten by a cellmate in 
the city jail

its in worse shape than ive ever seen it before 
weve got a lot of poor people a lot of problems and no money 
to deal with them said lawyer rex carr a member of a panel 
convened to study those problems i see no hope of getting 
adequate funds there is no hope for east st louis under present 
circumstances 
someone i heard say they expect cities like east st louis 
to lift themselves up by the bootstraps he added people have 
no boots to lift on youve got to give them the boots 
mayor carl officer criticized by some for running a 
reckless administration is defiant in the face of bankruptcy 
rumors

not bad financial condition he said thats poor financial 
planning 
political squabbles are frequent the citys twicemonthly 
paychecks were finally issued three days late last monday after 
money was borrowed from other accounts the treasurer argued the 
city didnt have the money the mayor said it did 
east st louis was once a vibrant town with chemical metal and 
glass works until crime corruption and labor troubles beginning 
about 1960 led to white flight and job losses this virtually 
allblack city has shrunk to 55000 people from 82000 in 1960 
today most of the major industries operate outside city limits 
and provide no tax base residents are poor recent estimates

prime location officer a thirdgeneration funeral director hopes 
to breathe new life into his city with a 500 million riverfront 
development plan that includes housing a recycling facility and an

businesses and trash on the streets 
crime has become so routine its a sight gag in the movie 
national lampoons vacation when the familys hubcaps are

third of the workforce may have to be laid off officials say 25

fall and sued its only one among scores of unpaid vendors a 
350000 contract has been signed with a new service but officer 
contends the city cant afford regular garbage pickup gentry 
already has strict priorities payroll then gas for fire and 
police vehicles then he said you pay off who raises the most 
hell

actress victoria principal has a mothers day 
message for millions of american women pay attention to aches and 
pains that could be early signs of arthritis 
you dont have to live the last years of your life with the 
degree of discomfort that elderly people have lived with for 
years she said in a recent interview 
one in seven americans some 37 million people have been 
diagnosed with arthritis the disease affects twice as many women 
than men 
the key miss principal said is to take a few minutes to learn 
the basic symptoms of the 100 various forms arthritis and then seek 
medical attention if it seems warranted 
if youre more aware of your body if you seriously listen to 
the indications of your body that something is wrong and go to a 
doctor you arent being an alarmist she said you are simply 
listening to your body and taking good care of yourself 
miss principal head of the arthritis foundations national 
campaign since 1983 emphasizes early detection not because there 
is a cure for the disease but because research advances of the 
past few years have developed more and better ways to alleviate 
suffering 
crippling pain is no longer something that is inevitable 
she said we dont have all the answers yet but we have more 
answers than weve had before by an early diagnosis you can 
perhaps prevent the kind of crippling that we have seen in 
generations of americans in older age 
miss principals mother and father have lived with arthritis for 
years 
arthritis sufferers can find help at arthritis foundation 
chapters in all 50 states which provide referral to free local 
selfhelp programs 
for those not yet aware of problems the warning signs of 
arthritis are soreness or redness or swelling of the joints and 
morning fatigue that persist for two weeks or more 
the inflamation is a tipoff she said if you have that 
then something is definitely wrong even if you dont think you 
have arthritis that indicates you should go see a doctor 
a major problem she said is that most people eventually 
diagnosed with arthritis didnt see a doctor until three years 
after their first symptoms appeared 
if you suspected you might have cancer or heart disease you 
would probably go out and see your doctor right away she said 
were asking people to take it seriously in a medical sense 
because things can be done particularly the sooner you get it 
diagnosed 
generally those things are a combination of medication and 
exercise 
the range of medication ranges from the very mild such as 
aspirin to some very very very powerful drugs if you have a real 
severe form or arthritis that is not responding to other types of 
medication said peter g mathon a vice president of the 
atlantabased arthritis foundation 
in the most extreme cases surgical joint replacement can be an 
option as it has been for mathon who has had seven hip joint 
replacements 
while medication would to be taken under the guidance of a 
physician exercise too should be carefully monitored 
there is a fine line said mathon you want to keep the 
joint moving enough so it doesnt freeze up yet you dont want to 
overwork to the point where you do more damage to the joint each 
person is going to be a little different 
in addition to medication and exercise researchers are working 
hard to link certain diets with the onset of arthritis 
i think were starting to see some preliminary results in that 
area and i think that eventually we will have better answers and 
there will probably some links between some types of arthritis and 
some foods said mathon 
miss principal who has written books on diet and exercise said 
she is convinced the links will be found 
its that old thing your mother used to say you are what you 
eat she said i really believe that i think were going to 
discover that certain foods can perhaps trigger more profound 
reactions 
scientists have discovered there are genetic patterns but miss 
principal said the reason something fires that genetic marker no 
one really understands yet 
the actress said she became involved with the arthritis 
foundation at first as a highprofile fundraiser to try to do 
something for her parents on a larger scale something more 
than just helping with their own treatment 
after i got involved it escalated to an even larger scale and 
i discovered how many people i know who have arthritis and had 
never told me she said 
miss principal and mathon were in washington for a 
governmentbacked general health care forum 
one of the new and different programs sponsored by the 
arthritis foundation is selfhelp classes around the nation mathon 
said 
in addition to learning more about the disease the programs 
sometimes involve exercise programs run in conjunction with local 
ymcas and similar organizations 
we also offer support groups he said they get together 
to talk about their experiences and share little tips and tricks 
with each other one of the main things is they realize theyre not 
the only ones going through these feelings of up and down because 
arthritis does tend to be a roller coaster disease you can feel 
better some days and worse some days you can got into remission 
in effect you can be lulled into a false sense of security 
locations of state arthritis foundation offices can be obtained 
through local telephone directories or by writing the national 
headquarters at 1314 spring st nw atlanta ga 30309 
the foundation also works through the american association of 
retired persons or aarp to get out information about its programs

back in the last century or thereabouts it was 
pretty easy to forecast the weather by how the sky looked or how 
birds caterpillars and other creatures behaved anybody could do 
it and many did 
everybody talked about the weather especially farmers and their 
neighbors there was talk about hard times too and how it seemed 
nobody was doing anything about it 
if times were good farmers kept their mouths shut knowing that 
another drought or something bad was right around the corner 
not much was heard about economic forecasts though somebody in 
the government or a bigshot financier occasionally said something 
but scientifically developed projections did not abound 
todays economic forecasting once as primitive as predicting 
the weather from the loops in chicken entrails has come a long 
way to be sure but agricultural economists still have their 
problems with weather the greatest single variable confronting 
farmers 
and the agricultural economists weather map is a lot bigger 
these days global in fact hundreds of people in the agriculture 
department for example look at and analyze world weather 
conditions 
clark edwards of the departments economic research service says 
weather isnt the only guidepost domestic and foreign polices of 
other countries demand trends population growth and economic 
growth are all part of the package 
farmers have little defense against uncertain events that 
occur because of government actions or as a result of major 
variations in world weaher patterns he said that was evident 
during the agricultural boom of the 1970s and the bust of the 1980s 
who could have foretold the devastatingly late and poor 
monsoon in asia and its effect on the 1987 crop and on world 
prices edwards said what farmer could have said in the early 
1980s i choose to farm in an economy with a larger money supply 
and therefore with lower interest rates 
edwards added because of the unpredictability of major events 
that affect the national and international agricultural economies 
it is getting harder to know how to use economic forecasts 
one solution would be to simply accept a forecast and act 
accordingly farmers often do that when dealing about events and 
processes with which they are familiar he said the likely 
response of corn yields to fertilizer applications or milk yields 
in response to feeding rates are examples 
and some economic forecasts are hedged by giving users a set of 
possible outcomes that illustrate the uncertainties for example 
the agencys forecast of net cash farm income this year is in a 
range of 50 billion to 55 billion 
a farm equipment manufacturer for whom this forecast is 
important might determine then consequences if the actual outcome 
is at one end of the range or the other and then attach a degree 
of confidence to each of the two outcomes edwards said using 
this information a manager can work out the best position to take 
this is one way to allow for known risks 
but edwards acknowledged in an article published in the may 
issue of agricultural outlook magazine that it is getting harder 
for farmers to make decisions when they are increasingly faced by 
uncertainties caused by events which they can neither predict nor 
control 
greater exposure to these uncertainties has come along with 
us farmers increasing dependence on world markets he said 
two major sources of risk are climatic events in other 
hemispheres and the policies and actions of governments 
a classic example of a global influence on american farmers is 
the soviet union since 1972 when moscow secretly bought the 
equivalent of onefourth of that years us wheat crop weather in 
the soviet union has been watched almost as intently as it is in 
kansas and iowa 
the huge 1972 purchases led to a bilateral agreement several 
years later pledging the soviet union to buy us wheat and corn 
on a sustained annual basis that was one attempt to soften some of 
the variables connected with the export trade 
united states and soviet government policy changes can 
exacerbate the effect that russian weather patterns have on us 
wheat producers edwards said there was a time when the 
ussr tended to tighten its collective belt after a short crop 
now the soviets are more likely to seek imports to stabilize their 
livestock economy with larger needs in some years and smaller 
needs in others 
the export enhancement program or eep is a more recent example 
of the us government trying to soften some of the variables for 
american farmers by providing subsidies of taxpayerowned surplus 
grain to exporters so they can sell wheat and other designated 
commodities to selected foreign buyers including the soviet union 
at bargain prices 
other usda activities such as the targeted export asssistance 
program or tea help promote us commodities in foreign markets 
its all part of the forecasting business and must be taken into 
consideration when department economists make predictions 
still farmers plans based on forecasts can receive as great 
a shock from say the weather affecting the soybean crop in south 
america this may and june as from the weather on their own farm 
edwards said

the treasury department has set plans to 
borrow 26 billion to replenish government coffers next week down 
37 percent from the borrowing needs in the first three months of 
the year 
the lower borrowing resulted in part from efforts by foreign 
governments to prop up the value of the dollar by making heavy 
purchases of us securities in recent months 
treasury has been able to reduce its public borrowing demands 
because of the large volume of securities sold to foreign central 
banks which have been selling their japanese yen german marks and 
other foreign currencies to buy dollars as a way of stabilizing the 
dollars value 
the foreign governments then used their newlypurchased dollars 
to buy us treasury securities 
at a briefing wednesday william bremner deputy assistant 
secretary for federal finance told reporters that the purchases by 
foreign central banks totaled 12 billion from october through 
december last year and 165 billion from january through march 
this year 
the heavy purchases of us debt by foreign governments have 
raised concerns about the growing influence us allies have over 
the us economy if they suddenly curb their purchases of us 
debt it could send interest rates up sharply in this country 
the announcement that 26 billion in new debt would be sold next 
week was in line with market expectations the auctions known as 
quarterly refundings provide the main source by which the 
government finances the 25 trillion national debt 
the auctions next week call for 
875 billion in threeyear notes in minimum denominations of 
5000 to be auctioned on tuesday 
875 billion in 10year notes in minimum denominations of 
1000 to be auctioned on wednesday 
850 billion in 30year bonds in minimum denominations of 
1000 to be auctioned on thursday 
the 26 billion to be raised includes 95 billion in new cash 
and 165 billion to pay off maturing securities 
a total of 15 billion of the new cash will be used to retire 
existing debt something the government has not done since the 
first year of president reagans first term in office 
but bremner said that did not mean the total national debt would 
be reduced by 15 billion during the quarter because the 
government also borrows money from such nonpublic sources as the 
social security trust fund 
a reduction of the public debt during the spring quarter was 
commonplace before reagan took office because the government always 
benefited from the april tax deadline 
however this debt reduction has not occurred since 1981 because 
the level of the governments borrowing needs has grown 
dramatically with the string of huge federal deficits 
the 26 billion to be borrowed next week is down from 27 
billion raised at the last quarterly refunding in february

coleco industries inc will have to 
intensify its costcutting and streamlining efforts to bounce back 
from a string of financial losses according to the outgoing chief 
of the toymaker 
arnold c greenberg the companys chairman and chief executive 
officer resigned his posts wednesday but will remain a consultant 
and director of the company 
colecos board of directors named morton e handel to succeed 
greenberg as chairman and chief executive and promoted handel to 
the board coleco said in a statement j brian clarke will 
continue as president and chief operating officer 
in the statement announcing his resignation greenberg said 
it is necessary to intensify and accelerate cost cutting actions 
already begun and to further contract the size of the company to 
help it recover from a string of financial losses 
greenberg said financially directed leadership is desirable 
during this period and i believe morton handel working together 
withclarke can accomplish these critical objectives 
coleco which once rode high on the success of its cabbage patch 
kids dolls has suffered declining sales in recent years along with 
other major toy manufacturers the toymaker posted losses of 1054 
million in 1987 and 1112 million in 1986 following record 
profits of 642 million in 1985 
coleco has slashed its work force by more than 50 percent since 
last november including layoffs of about 475 workers announced 
tuesday 
the company also is attempting to stave off having to file for 
bankruptcy protection from creditors by seeking to restructure 335 
million in debt 
coleco paid 596 million in interest during 1987 or nearly 12 
percent of the years sales compared with 427 million in 1986 
it failed to make a 19 million interest payment due on debentures 
on april 1 
however coleco debt holders have been cool to its proposal to 
exchange their debt securities for a combination of new debt and 
common stock and coleco has been forced to extend the deadline for 
the offer twice the new deadline is friday may 13 
coleco also announced wednesday that it had hired hallwood group 
inc to help it restructure its balance sheet and provide working 
capital hallwood is an international merchant banking group 
specializing in financial restructurings 
greenberg has said the company planned to pare its 1988 
operating costs by about 70 million or 25 percent 
after a series of spotty financial performances in the late 
1970s and early 1980s coleco began moving toward prosperity in 
1982 with the introduction of its colecovision home video game 
system but the 600 adam home computer it unveiled in 1983 proved 
a flopm sales of colecovision cooled and in 1984 coleco lost 
798 million 
colecos fortunes soared on the phenomenal strength of its 
cabbage patch kids 
the dolls accounted for sales of 67 million when introduced 
quietly in 1983 but skyrocketed during a national craze that 
boosted sales to 540 million in 1984 and a peak of 600 million in 
1985 
coleco boasted total sales of 776 million in 1985 but by 1986 
was on a downward trend led by cabbage patch sales that plummeted 
to 230 million

late april domestic car sales sagged below 
yearearlier levels while for the full month import car makers 
showed signs of rebounding despite pricing disadvantages stemming 
from the weaker us dollar 
combined domestic car and truck sales fell 26 percent to 
420626 in the sales period of april 2130 the automakers reported 
wednesday 
general motors corp car sales for the late april period fell 
197 percent from a strongerthanusual sales period a year 
earlier leading a 67 percent decline in domestic car sales 
chrysler corp car sales rose 103 percent from the year earlier 
and ford motor co sales were up 87 percent 
domestic truck sales for all makers rose by 65 percent 
industry analyst david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc in 
new york said the figures were skewed because gm sales surged last 
april due to sales incentives 
they were 55 percent of the market so the comparison will be 
kind of distorted gm will look poor healy said 
for the month gm car sales were down 142 percent to a total of 
314671 fords were down 14 percent to 186175 and chryslers 
sales rose 88 percent to 95170 
gm held a 472 percent makret share during the late april 
period compared with 279 percent for ford and 139 percent for 
chrysler gms share in the yearearlier period was 549 percent 
due largely to the special sales incentives 
imported car sales totaled 236451 up 07 percent for april 
though imported light truck sales plunged 374 percent to a 50318 
monthly total importers report their sales monthly 
the decline of the dollar over the past three years has forced 
japanese and european automakers to raise their prices to reflect 
the strengthening of their own currencies 
as a result the japanese imports have begun using the tactic of 
sales incentives that domestic manufacturers have focused on for 
the past couple of years said chris cedergren analyst at jd 
power amp associates in agoura hills calif 
nissan with aggressive incentive programs sold 31197 imported 
cars for the month up 73 percent and 6545 usproduced cars 
up 28 percent 
toyota sold 43605 imports up slightly from 43339 and 2200 
usmade cars up from 2187 
honda import sales dropped 36 percent to 19702 but sales of 
domestically made hondas rose 75 percent to 17512 
volkswagen import sales dropped 25 percent to 11922 and 
domestic sales sank 75 percent to 2712

united airlines said wednesday it would ban 
smoking on all its flights of 1000 miles or less within the united 
states or canada as of june 1 in an attempt to remedy confusion 
over a new federal rule banning smoking on shortduration flights 
federal regulations that took effect april 22 prohibit smoking 
on flights scheduled to take two hours or less 
but because of headwinds or air traffic flights between the 
same cities can take different amounts of time when travel is in 
different directions united spokesman rob doughty said wednesday 
that has caused some confusion among united passengers and crew 
he said 
the new rule will add 53 pairs of cities to the list of 
nonsmoking united flights said john r zeeman a united vice 
president 
doughty said the twohour rule affects 57 percent of all united 
flights and the new 1000mile rule would affect 77 percent of the 
airlines flights 
we certainly think it works better for the customers and for 
united airlines to make the criterion mileage instead of time 
doughty said

a tentative twoyear labor agreement 
completed in marathon negotiations between chrysler corp and the 
united auto workers now faces the scrutiny of the unions national 
chrysler council and the rank and file 
union and chrysler negotiators finished twoandahalf weeks of 
bargaining capped by nearly 40 hours of nonstop negotiations 
wednesday over a contract covering 66000 hourly and salaried 
workers in 15 states 
the pact which largely mirrors the jobprotecting contracts 
already in force at chrysler rivals ford motor co and general 
motors corp will go before the uaws 140member national chrysler 
council on friday before it can be put to a ratification vote next 
week 
chryslers chief negotiator vice president anthony st john 
called the agreement equitable and affordable and said the 
settlement cleared the way for improved labor relations after 
months of bitter conflict 
unlike the ford and gm contracts it also prevents chrysler 
executives from receiving cash or stock bonuses in years when 
workers receive no profitsharing 
the clause is important to chrysler workers who were angered at 
the generosity of 1987 executive compensation that included 179 
million in earningsy by chrysler chairman lee iacocca 
we think its a breakthrough we think its time in america 
that this disparity come to an end said uaw vice president marc 
stepp the unions chief negotiator 
the contract includes the same profitsharing formula contained 
in the ford and gm contracts and will produce its first payout in 
march 1989 out of 1988 profits 
also unlike the ford and gm pacts the chrysler contract 
includes a 1000 bonus for signing the pact which replaces a 
threeyear contract set to expire sept 14 chrysler workers 
received a 2120 signing bonus in 1985 for agreeing to a 
threeyear contract 
the new contract if ratified would expire with the gm and ford 
contracts on sept 14 1990 allowing the uaw to bargain with the 
big three simultaneously for the first time since 1979 
under the pattern contract workers will receive lump sum 
bonuses of 3 percent of wages in 1989 and 1990 
the contract prevents plant closings not already announced when 
negotiations began and requires purchasers of any chrysler plants 
to accept the contract 
it forbids layoffs for any reasons except slow sales halves the 
rate of attrition and makes it more difficult for the company to 
move work to outside companies or foreign countries chrysler 
agreed to spend up to 230 million on the base employment levels 
program which will continue paying workers the automaker must 
place in a job bank if it eliminates their jobs for reasons other 
than production cuts 
uaw leaders agreed to encourage local unions to consider 
adopting japanesestyle work agreements that organize workers into 
teams increasing efficiency and product quality 
chrysler agreed to uaw representation of salaried workers at 
three new locations and the uaw agreed to allow chrysler 
flexibility in using those workers 
chrysler and the uaw began bargaining on april 18 in an effort 
to heal a series of wounds that inflicted beginning with chryslers 
announcement in january that it planned to close a 5500worker 
kenosha wis assembly plant that had been scheduled to run five 
more years 
that was followed by plans to sell chryslers 28000worker 
acustar inc parts subsidiary which sparked companywide protests 
and plans for crippling plantbyplant strikes 
in early march chrysler backed down from the sale and agreed to 
early talks 
but negotiations were nearly derailed at the start by by 
disclosure of iacoccas 1987 earnings the companys demand to 
severely restrict when workers could retire with full benefits and 
confirmation that chrysler planned to move its kcar production to 
mexico in the summer 
iacocca mended those blunders last week by announcing kcar 
production would stay in detroit until years end and that the 
kenosha plant would stay open until years end

the cabinet on thursday approved proposals 
that would allow the setting up of new securities firms ending a 
15yearold ban on the issuing of such licenses a government 
official reported 
the new rules proposed by the finance ministry also allow 
foreigners to invest in local brokerage houses said lu daungyen 
vice chairman of the securities and excahnge commission 
lu told reporters the new rules were part of government measures 
to expand access to the local securities market for taiwans 
cashrich investors 
taiwan now has 28 licensed securities firms including 14 banks 
acting as brokerage firms 
under the new rules each foreign investor will be allowed to 
invest up to 10 percent of the total shares of a local securities 
firm while total foreign shares should not exceed 40 percent lu 
said 
lu said the new rules would become effective in two weeks when 
details are worked out 
the government suspended the licensing of new securities 
companies in 1973 saying new firms were not needed because of the 
small size of the local stock market 
trading on the local stock market has however increased 
recently daily trading volume of the market last year averaged 93 
billion taiwan dollars or 3253 million about four times the 
1986 average

officers of integrity insurance co 
illegally drained the company of cash and committed corporate 
racketeering that caused its 300 million collapse last year the 
state says in a lawsuit 
the lawsuit filed here wednesday by the state department of 
insurance accuses former company president christian yegen of 
tenafly and others of doctoring financial records to convince 
regulators and customers alike that the company was sound and able 
to pay its claims 
the lawsuit describes the paramus companys deficit at more than 
300 million one of the largest insurance failures ever according 
to state officials the deficit may eventually exceed 1 billion 
once all claims are settled several years from now the state 
alleged 
we are trying to get the money back said state insurance 
commissioner kenneth d merin the collapse has had a major 
impact not only on people who bought insurance but on the 
industry because it has raised questions about its ability to 
carry out its mission 
in its lawsuit the state charged that integrity was insolvent 
as early as 1981 six years before the state ousted its owners and 
took control of the company 
yegen denied that the company filed false financial reports 
we stated the numbers as they appeared at the time yegen 
told the record of hackensack 
to hide its deepening financial woes the state charged the 
company periodically transferred cash among related corporations 
and fraudulently inflated its worth by claiming uncollectable debts 
as assets 
company officials including yegen also authorized up to 13 
million in illegal dividends to shareholders and furnished 
falsified reports to the state department of insurance the federal 
securities and exchange commission and other regulatory agencies 
the state alleged in the superior court suit 
the company is also under investigation by the state attorney 
generals office which could file criminal charges

a group led by united airlines pilots is making 
a new 4 billion bid to take over the airline saying the takeover 
would benefit shareholders and energize workers 
the pilots offer their third in a year to propose an employee 
takeover or restructuring of the carrier includes payment of 110 
cash per outstanding share of allegis corp the airlines parent 
company the refinancing of certain allegis debts and wage cuts 
and other concessions to trim labor costs said william r howard 
chairman of airline acquisition corp 
the corporation was formed by the united air lines pilots master 
executive council to oversee a proposed takeover of the airline 
we are excited about our proposal howard wrote in a letter 
to stephen m wolf chairman of allegis which is based in suburban 
elk grove village 
it offers allegis stockholders a significant premium over 
current market for their shares howard said it also offers 
united an opportunity to be the premier airline in the united 
states and employees an incentive to achieve that result by 
allowing them to reap directly the fruits of their own labors 
wolf said wednesday he would have no immediate comment on the 
offer 
allegis stock closed at 90 a share wednesday up 525 in 
trading on the new york stock exchange 
the takeover would be financed through 31 billion in bank 
loans provided by a syndicate of banks led by chemical bank a 600 
million bank credit facility and the sale of 800 million in 
subordinated notes howard said 
chemical and the investment firm salomon brothers have indicated 
they were highly confident they could raise the needed financing 
the pilots group said 
in a statement read by allegis spokesman dan sheehy wolf said 
the board of directors has indicated it will do what is in the 
best interest of our shareholders and our employees and we will 
respond as soon as we have had a chance to understand whether this 
is a valid offer 
the pilots group made two offers last year to buy or 
restructure the airline and company officials rejected both 
in his letter howard proposed a 25 percent pay cut for some 
pilots a reduction in company contributions to a pilots benefit 
plan and changes in compensation and workrules of noncontract 
employees those moves he said would save as much as 350 million 
a year 
but the proposed takeover hinges on the unions success in a 
lawsuit challenging the companys takeover provisions 
last week the united pilots group sued the airline along with 
allegis and the machinists union to strike down machinists 
contract provisions that the lawsuit claimed could block an 
employee takeover of united 
hank krakowski a pilots union spokesman said at the time the 
contract prohibited the pilots union from participating in an 
employee ownership plan unless the machinists agree to the terms 
unless parts of the machinists contract are declared 
unenforceable by the us district court in chicago the 
protective covenants in them would be a significant 
obstacle to wednesdays proposed takeover howard said 
howard former chairman of piedmont aviation proposed in his 
letter that he be chairman and chief executive officer of the new 
company formed by the employee takeover 
the proposal also states that all employees would participate 
on a fair and equitable basis in the ownership of the company 
howard also indicated that the group might seek to have its 
proposal put to a vote of united shareholders once it resolved the 
machinists issue

usg corp said it has received commitments to 
finance a 22 billion recapitalization plan designed to thwart a 
hostile takeover bid from desert partners lp 
in making the announcement wednesday usg chairman and chief 
executive officer robert j day said lets make it clear usg is 
not for sale 
earlier in the day desert partners a partnership headed by two 
texas oilmen offered to acquire the chicagobased building 
materials company in a negotiated deal that wall street analysts 
estimated would be worth about 50 a share or about 26 billion 
under one of two proposals desert partners would pay 39 in 
cash and 9 in bonds for each outstanding share of usg stock 
shareholders also would receive stock representing 15 percent of a 
new company 
under a variation desert partners offered to pay 50 a share in 
cash for 371 million or 72 percent of usgs outstanding shares 
the remaining shares would be exchanged for bonds and stock in the 
new company valued at the same aggregate amount desert 
partners said in a statement 
day said the proposals are not credible desert partners 
financing commitments prohibit it from offering more than 45 per 
share 
after jumping 162 a share on wednesday usg declined 75 cents 
a share to 4587 in early trading today on the new york stock 
exchange 
texas oilmen cyril wagner jr and jack e brown who head the 
partnership have been trying to negotiate a deal for some time in 
a letter to usgs board of directors on wednesday wagner stressed 
that the time has come for you to stop spending time and money in 
an effort to avoid discussing an acquisition of usg with us 
desert partners also has a 42ashare tender offer outstanding 
that bid including cash for up to 39 million shares and debt 
securities and warrants valued at 42 each for the remainder has a 
value of about 22 billion 
usg has been fighting off desert partners for months 
under its recapitalization plan usg would borrow 22 billion 
to pay its shareholders 37 in cash debentures with a face value 
of 5 and a share of stock in the recapitalized company for each 
common share it said it would have to sell off its masonite and 
kinkead businesses to finance the restructuring 
desert partners owns about 99 percent of usgs shares and said 
that as of friday about 193 million shares or 375 percent had 
been tendered under its 42ashare offer 
in addition to masonite and kinkead usg owns united states 
gypsum usg interiors and several other operating subsidiaries

brazil the worlds third largest sugar exporter 
has decided to join the new international sugar agreement the 
pacts spokesman said thursday 
constantin politoff said he hoped the necessary legal procedures 
could be completed by may 18 when leading sugartrading nations who 
signed the agreement meet in london 
brazil had refused to join the new accord when it came into 
force march 24 because it provides for the cost of running the 
londonbased international sugar organization to be borne most 
heavily by producer nations 
the agreement reached at a london meeting called by the united 
nations is set to run until the end of 1990 
it has no provisions for controlling world sugar supplies and 
prices but politoff said he expects the may 18 meeting to discuss a 
clause allowing members to negotiate a new pact with regulatory 
powers

four of the nations biggest cable television 
companies announced today the formation of a research and 
development consortium that will focus on developing high 
definition tv and other new technologies for the cable industry 
cable television laboratories inc is expected to have an annual 
operating budget of 75 million the companies said 
their announcement followed the national cable television 
associations threeday annual convention that ended here tuesday 
and an association board meeting thursday 
this will allow us to develop our own technology more 
effectively and fully and that will be good for consumers who 
can benefit from research to improve reliability capacity and 
picture quality of cable systems said trygve myhren chairman of 
american television and communications corp the nations 
secondlargest cable company 
we want to make sure were doing the best job for consumers 
and be competitive with others he said 
joining atc in making an initial threeyear financial commitment 
to participate are telecommunications inc the largest us cable 
company no 3 continental cablevision and comcast cable 
communications the seventh largest 
combined these companies operate cable systems with more than 
11 million subscribers about a quarter of all the countrys cable 
subscribers 
other cable companies are expected to join the effort said 
myhren monthly dues will be 2 cents per subscriber 
the projected annual operating budget of 75 million is based 
on anticipated contributions from cable systems serving a total of 
about 31 million subscribers he said 
cable labs early research will include how best to use high 
definition tv technologies and fiber optics he said 
high definition tv still in a development phase is considered 
the next generation in television hdtv delivers a clearer picture 
with more brilliant color on a wider screen 
fiber optics could significantly increase capacity of cable 
systems and would help the cable industry compete with telephone 
companies if laws restricting phone company participation in the 
cable tv business were relaxed as many in the cable industry fear 
they might be 
unlike most of the wire now used by phone and cable companies 
fiber optic cable has capacity sufficient to bring voice data and 
video into the home through a single wire 
why cant that wire be our wire rather than the phone

some smokers will be able to purchase a virtually 
smokeless cigarette during the last three months of this year as 
the new product is testmarketed by one of the nations largest 
cigarette makers 
whether sales will make the enterprise worthwhile is open to 
speculation according to tobacco company analysts 
i think its a possibility somewhere greater than zero it 
could be a major thing it could be enough of an impact to slow 
down some of the antismoking campaign said neal kaplan an 
analyst with interstate securities in charlotte nc 
f ross johnson president and chief executive offer of rjr 
nabisco inc told company stockholders wednesday the cigarette 
would be available in lead markets sometime during the fourth 
quarter 
we are very positive about the prospects for this new 
cigarette and believe it will provide consumers with another 
alternative in their selection of cigarette brands and styles 
johnson said 
the company remains secretive about its plans for the product 
developed in a threeyear project codenamed operation black 
hole for competitive reasons 
there will be no information on the test markets the products 
brand name projected sales or inventory until just before the 
product is available according to david fishel spokesman for rjr 
subsidiary rj reynolds tobacco co in winstonsalem nc 
the product will be manufactured at one of rj reynolds plants 
in the winstonsalem area fishel said 
rj reynolds tobacco manufactures about onethird of the almost 
600 billion cigarettes sold domestically each year its brand names 
include winston salem camel and vantage 
the new cigarette will emit almost no smoke from the lit end 
and smoke exhaled will dissipate more rapidly that normal 
cigarettes rj reynolds said 
the cigarette does give off nicotine and carbon monoxide and 
medical groups including the american medical association and 
american heart association have asked the federal food and drug 
administration to regulate the cigarette a decision on that 
request will take several months 
financial analysts are unsure of the impact the smokeless 
cigarette will have on the cigarette market rjrs stock fell 87 
cents to 49 in slow trading on the new york stock exchange 
kaplan of interstate securities said brand loyalty is high 
among smokers who might not be inclined to try the new cigarette 
but smokers who find their habit restricted at work and in 
public might turn to the product as an alternative but keep 
their pack of winstons to smoke in their car he said 
lawrence adelman an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in 
new york said the products development was a correct and 
aggressive response to the cigarette smoking controversy and 
antismoking campaigns 
but he said it was to early to tell whether the product will be 
a success no other tobacco companies have announced plans to 
produce a similar cigarette although they are figured to be 
working on the technology adelman speculated competitors were 
letting rjr nabisco pave the way and go forward and have all the 
initial headaches

two more public utility districts that are 
defendants in the securities fraud case brought against the 
washington public power supply system have announced outofcourt 
settlements 
the two kittitas county and ferry county will not have to 
raise rates to cover the 175 million they agreed to pay to be let 
out of the case said malcolm harris a seattle attorney 
representing the utilities 
the case was filed in 1983 after wppss defaulted on bond 
payments for two scrapped nuclear plants 
the settlements and defense costs if approved by a federal 
court judge will be paid by the utilities insurance companies 
harris said 
neither utility was among the 88 participants in the two nuclear 
plants nos 4 and 5 but both are members of wppss and were named 
as defendants in a federal suit brought by holders of the bonds 
that financed the two plants the plants were terminated in early 
1982 
the settlement reached on april 27 was not made public until 
wednesday 
the lawsuit is scheduled for trial sept 7 in tucson ariz 
the ferrykittitas settlement was the ninth to be announced 
since the suit was filed and brings total settlement amounts to 
about 242 million among others that were settled were the bond 
underwriters for 92 million and seattle 50 million three 
other public utility districts that were participants in the 
projects settled for 20 million 
wppss terminated the two plants no 4 at hanford and no 5 at 
satsop in 1982 after 225 billion had been invested no 4 was 
24 percent complete and no 5 was 16 percent finished 
termination of the plants eventually resulted in default on the 
225 billion in bonds sold to finance the construction of nos 4 
and 5 it was the biggest default in the history of the municipal 
bond market most of the litigation has been consolidated into the 
case set for trial in tucson

mike halstead mopped his face with a 
towel as he walked away from an exhausting session that had nothing 
to do with making cars at the local mazda motor corp plant 
halstead headed for the shower while other mazda employees 
continued grunting through repetitions on weight machines pedaled 
away on manual exercise bikes and worked on balance and agility on 
a simulated crosscountry ski unit in one corner of the flat rock 
plants fitness center 
job one the first mazda car made at flat rock rolled off 
the assembly line in september in november the company opened the 
1 million fitness center in a 90000squarefoot section of one of 
the plant buildings 
fitness programs once the reserve of management are moving 
from the front office to the plant floor at many companies said 
thomas merry midwest region vice president for fitness systems 
thats where we see the direction of this thing going 
its been an administrative headquarters whitecollar kind of 
phenomenon said merry whose los angelesbased company designs 
sets up and operates fitness programs now he said we do see 
more plant sites getting involved 
reasons range from simple economics an unhealthy worker costs 
more to keep on the job to companies desire to be involved with 
employees as a way of keeping them involved in their work 
at flat rock the matter was never in question said don r 
kricho personnel safety and health director 
japanese corporations routinely provide extras for improving the 
health and lifestyle of their employees single workers may even 
live in company dormitories there 
it was always pretty much taken for granted that we were going 
to do something in terms of a fitness center kricho said in 
japan its something they do 
a study conducted last year on the staywell program control data 
corp of minneapolis implemented for its employees linked higher 
health insurance claims with various risk factors including lack 
of exercise smoking excess weight and high cholesterol 
for example sedentary employees have 30 percent more hospital 
days than those who get adequate exercise and employees who smoke a 
pack or more of cigarettes a day have 18 percent higher medical 
claims costs than nonsmokers 
there are some very solid practical business reasons for 
wanting to do this mazdas kricho said fit happy workers 
produce more they are less likely to be absent they are less 
likely to be injured 
before and after work at flat rock as early as 530 am and as 
late as 9 pm the sounds of weight machines dribbling 
basketballs and squeaking sneakers footfalls on the onefifth mile 
track volleys on the tennis courts golf balls driven into a net 
pingpong games and players shouts echo under the high plant 
ceiling 
some nights i call over here and its so loud you cant even 
talk on the phone said cynthia t nemon plant medical services 
coordinator and fitness center director 
domestic companies get the message general motors corp and 
ford motor co plants offer a scattering of exercise rooms and 
aerobics classes chrysler corp is surveying some assembly plant 
orkers to see if they want aerobics classes 
kellogg co in battle creek mich offers a healthy 
lifestyle program for employees that includes newsletters and 
reimbursement for participation in fitness activities said dick 
lovell company communications manager 
kellogg opened a fitness center at its corporate headquarters in 
1986 and followed in january with a center at its battle creek 
cereal plant where the exercise bikes rowing machines 
weightlifting equipment jogging track and aerobics room are in 
such demand among the 3200 employees that hours have been extended 
to midnight lovell said 
at flat rock mazdas center is part of an involvement with 
employees similar to that in its japanese plants 
the number of japanese employees at flat rock 600 of the 
plants 3500 eventually will fall to about 100 but the company 
wants us employees to be instilled with japanesestyle team 
spirit 
we were not so much interested in building a recreation center 
for employees its great if they want to use it for that but we 
wanted to emphasize the team concept kricho said we were 
interested in building a facility that would cater to team 
activity 
team activity caught on immediately nemon said intensely 
involved employees formed committees for baseball volleyball 
weight training running martial arts aerobics and golf 
all the committees have established classes and leagues she 
said the employees themselves completely run those activities 
they have 20 different teams in the basketball league 
i worked at jeep before they never had anything like this 
said halstead just out of training as an assembly worker at mazda 
he compared the center favorably with outside programs 
explaining that he and his wife had spent 400 at the y which 
didnt have a place to run 
i cant wait till they get that heavy bag up he said 
kricho said he envisions annual physicals for employees with 
prescriptions for good health habits quitting smoking weight 
control cholesterol reduction and hypertension control 
center activities already go far beyond traditional gymnasium 
fare nemon said including a diet support group and available 
literature on subjects ranging from smoking to personal 
relationships 
kricho said japanese companies view corporate responsibility as 
going beyond a paycheck 
and he said if we are responsible for human beings 
spiritual and mental well being and everything else a fitness 
center becomes a very central ingredient a focal point

these are heady days for light beer 
while overall growth in the beer business has flattened out 
light beer sales remain effervescent they have nearly doubled in 
the past seven years and now account for more than 24 percent of 
the overall beer market 
the major brewers are encouraging the growth by spending nearly 
220 million a year on advertising light beers about a third of 
their total ad budgets according to leading national advertisers 
which tracks such spending 
in the latest indication of the importance brewers attach to the 
segment miller brewing co recently began testing a light version 
of its miller high life genuine draft beer which has been on the 
market less than two years 
industry executives and analysts say the nations weight and 
healthconsciousness continues to propel the segments growth 
you can drink the same amount of beer and take in less 
calories what more can one ask out of life said emanuel 
goldman who follows the beer industry for montgomery securities in 
san francisco 
the light beers typically have a third fewer calories than the 
140150 calories in regular beers and slightly less alcohol 
beverage industry analysts say another important ingredient in 
the success of light beers has been the ability of brewers to make 
and market a drink that traditional beer drinkers arent ashamed to 
order 
in the 1960s industry watchers said light beers had been 
pitched mainly as diet drinks for women 
michael bellas president of the research firm beverage 
marketing corp in new york said the country wasnt ready for a 
lowcalorie approach then 
pitching the drink to women may also have alienated some men 
which is something brewers normally try to avoid since men 
reportedly consume about 80 percent of all the beer sold 
robert s weinberg a brewing industry consultant and professor 
of marketing at the john m olin school of business at washington 
university in st louis said another flaw in the light beers of 
the 1960s was taste 
they were horrible and usually died a fast death they didnt 
taste like beer and were poorly marketed he said 
milwaukeebased miller began to turn that around in 1973 when it 
started testing a new light beer under the lite name it bought from 
another brewer 
everything you always wanted in a beer and less was the 
original theme the brewer used former athletes and celebrities to 
sell its beer an approach that it continues to use 15 years later 
the approach infuriated critics who said it encouraged young 
people to drink but it helped miller convince customers that it 
was acceptable for tough guys to drink light beer 
others brewers were skeptical about lites chances and stayed 
out of that end of the market for a few years 
it was the only significant consumer packaged good industry 
where a company could bring out imaginative new products and not 
have competitors follow suit immediately weinberg said 
by the time others woke up miller had a grip on the market that 
it has been slow to yield 
we will never enjoy that kind of competitive advantage 
again admitted miller spokesman bob bertini 
beverage marketing said 451 million barrels of light beer were 
sold last year up 71 percent from the previous year while sales 
of all kinds of beer slipped 02 percent to 1872 million barrels 
there are about 70 light brands 
sales of miller lite were flat at about 193 million barrels 
but it is the secondbest selling beer overall budweiser is no 1 
at about 50 million barrels and holds a 2to1 lead in share of 
the light beer segment 
its main competition comes from bud light from anheuserbusch 
inc of st louis which sold an estimated 86 million barrels last 
year and from coors light from adolph coors co of golden colo 
which sold 79 million barrels 
beverage marketing estimates lite held 428 percent of the light 
segment in 1987 compared with 191 percent for bud light and 175 
percent for coors light 
bud light has grown at a furious pace since its introduction in 
1982 scoring well in consumer surveys with ads that show quirky 
responses to customers who ask for a light without specifying 
the brand and with commercials featuring party animal spuds 
mackenzie 
coors light introduced in 1977 has been advertised as the 
silver bullet that wont slow you down and the right beer 
now last year its sales surpassed those of coors premium beer 
for the first time 
other leading light beers include michelob light at 58 percent 
of the market and natural light at 51 percent from anheuserbusch 
stroh brewery co of detroit has captured about 62 percent of 
the market with two brands old milwaukee light and stroh light 
light beer accounted for 241 percent of overall beer sales in 
1987 up from 131 percent in 1980 can its share growth continue 
weinberg said the increasing incidence of brewers attaching 
their regular brands names to light beers show brewers are taking 
the segment seriously even if they are doing so partly just to get 
more shelf space 
others say as the median age of the population moves higher 
even more people will find themselves worrying about their weight 
thirty percent of the market doesnt seem to be 
unattainable said eric shepard executive editor of the industry 
newsletter beer marketers insights but can it get to 40 percent 
i just dont know

nasa administrator james c fletcher said 
today that space budget levels being discussed in congress will 
cripple americas space program and bring 30 years of progress to a 
halt 
it is not a pretty prospect to imagine the united states as a 
secondrate or even a thirdrate power in space fletcher said in 
remarks for a symposium on science education that is what this 
country will quickly become if congress doesnt act responsibly and 
give nasa the resources it needs to do its job 
the reagan administdration asked congress to give nasa 115 
billion in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 but key lawmakers have 
said that the agency can expect no more than 107 billion and a 
house budget resolution would slash the amount to 102 billion 
the civil space program will be stopped in its tracks at 
those levels fletcher said and it would spell death to the 
space station the key to our future in space he said the space 
shuttle would be able to operate only at a reduced flight rate in 
the years ahead 
at an authorization hearing wednesday the house space science 
subcommittee turned its back on a reagan administration plan to 
sign a contract this year to lease a robot space factory from a 
private company 
the probabilities are that there is going to be only one lousy 
bidder on it and thats a group of guys who couldnt sell to the 
private market said rep david nagle diowa 
that fear and a suspicion that building the factory might drain 
funds and future support for the planned large us space station 
prompted the house space science subcommittee to vote wednesday to 
prohibit contracts for the commercially developed space facility 
the national aeronautics and space administration will be required 
to obtain express permission from congress first 
nagle said the proposed lease was a project to benefit a group 
of people in houston 
space industries inc of houston has proposed leasing 70 percent 
of a robot space factory to the government for five years at 140 
million a year and leasing the rest to private industry the 
facility would be carried into orbit aboard the space shuttle and 
be serviced periodically by astronauts 
a vote for this is a vote to cripple the space station 
nagle said a vote for this is a vote to intimidate the efforts 
to build a space station a vote for this is to reward an 
incompetent presentation by the space agency that this committee 
should not tolerate 
his reference was to complaints by members of both the house and 
senate that nasa which once said it had no use for such a 
facility reversed itself but failed to make a case for why the 
space factory was needed 
nasa was obviously told to change its position said rep 
bill nelson dfla chairman of the house space science 
subcommittee 
the panel voted against a nagle amendment that nasa should not 
even be allowed to issue a request for industry proposals for the 
facility but it expressly forbade the agency to sign any contracts 
for it 
the instructions are included in a bill approved by the 
subcommittee wednesday to authorize 115 billion for nasa in the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 that amount an increase of 25 
billion over the current spending was asked for by president 
reagan and includes 967 million for the proposed us space 
station 
the space factory prohibition decision is a rebuff to reagan 
whose space policy announced in february included the intention 
to sign a contract in midsummer for such a facility to be available 
by late 1993 
reagans overall funding request for nasa also could be in 
trouble the house and senate appropriations committees which 
actually allocate funds have said they will not approve more than 
107 billion for the agency 
the committees bill also authorizes funds for the advanced 
communications technology satellite which the administration 
opposes it would grant arrest powers to private security guards on 
nasa facilities and it would require nasa contractors to maintain 
a drugfree workplace

it was noontime in front of a bank of elevators 
and takeover artist carl c icahn texaco incs largest 
stockholder was cornered 
yes or no the reporters asked would he vote his shares in 
favor of the companys bankruptcy reorganization plan or not 
icahn who had all but said yes at a press conference continued 
to hedge lunging for the elevator as the down bell rang 
but each time the doors opened the car was full packed no 
room for the tall gangly icahn the doors closed and the 
questions resumed 
two edgy advisers pulled their boss aside after a brief 
animated discussion icahn flicked the back of his hand walked 
back to the reporters and fired off his answer yes im voting 
for the plan 
always his own boss the brassy corporate bearhunter is at once 
a book thats open and shut a master strategist who knows the 
value of a wellkept secret but whos not afraid to make a quick 
decision 
icahn who recently described himself in fortune magazine as 
obsessive in everything i do draws attention easily in 
manner and presence 
he stands over 6 feet tall and his face bears a startling 
resemblance to comedian mel brooks often reluctant to speak to the 
press he is actually quite loquacious in person people who know 
him say 
i talk to him all the time i mean i listen to him all the 
time theres a difference joked texaco president james w 
kinnear recently 
icahns involvement with texaco has been no laughing matter to 
texacos managers especially kinnear 
they believe he wants to gain control of texaco in order to milk 
its assets dry a process that would leave the company in 
shambles holding 148 percent of texacos stock icahn has 
demanded that texaco put itself up for sale and has nominated his 
own slate of candidates including himself for the companys 
board of directors 
not long ago more than a few industry analysts were betting 
privately that icahn would win saying disgruntled shareholders 
were itching to get back at texacos management for its 
multibilliondollar pennzoil debacle 
now they say the tide may have shifted in texacos favor 
especially since the company reinstated its annual dividend to 
shareholders 
texaco on tuesday asked a federal court to block all of icahns 
maneuverings against the company charging him with a long list of 
securities laws violations 
icahn denies the allegations and says hes not through with 
texaco yet 
ive learned one thing what counts is which way the tide is 
going on the last day he said 
whatever happens it is generally agreed that if anyone could 
dislodge the status quo at texaco its icahn the man whose very 
name can send shivers through boardrooms across the land 
the 52yearold financier has made his reputation by buying up 
shares in companies with assets worth more than their stock price 
then selling the companies off later in whole or in pieces at a 
higher price 
sometimes companies agree to buy the stock back at a premium to 
get him to leave them alone a practice known as greenmail other 
times as with trans world airlines inc and acf industries inc 
icahn has retained a management role but always with the intent of 
using the company as a vehicle for later takeover attempts 
recently for example he offered to buy the 23 percent of twa 
stock he does not already own twa holds nearly 60 percent of his 
texaco stake by taking the company private icahn would be freer 
to sell twa or use it as an investment vehicle 
one way or another icahn almost always walks away millions of 
dollars richer some of his more than 20 takeover targets have 
included chesebroughponds inc marshall field co hammermill 
paper co phillips petroleum co unocal corp and usx corp in 
which he still holds a sizable stake 
to his critics icahn is little more than a pirate in a coat and 
tie 
icahn says the real villains are corporate chieftans who are 
wasteful inefficient and more interested in protecting their 
highsalaried jobs than looking out for the interests of their real 
bosses the stockholders 
that more than the money which he does not need is what 
keeps him in the takeover game icahn told the associated press 
i think theres no question theres a competitive force in me 
but its also a sense of outrage about the way companies are run 
he said 
in the case of texaco icahn has said he would withdraw his 
slate of board candidates if the company were put up for sale at a 
minimum 55 a share selling his stake at that level would net 
icahn about 757 million before costs compared with roughly 540 
million if he sold out now 
but icahns holding is too big to unload on the open market 
quickly without diluting its value unless he wants to stay in the 
oil business icahns only other choice may be to sell to another 
big entity such as an oil company 
some were watching hungrily as texaco emerged from a year of 
bankruptcy court protection paying 3 billion to pennzoil co to 
settle the lawsuit texaco lost over its 1984 acquisition of getty 
oil co and promising to unload billions of dollars in assets 
analysts say those potential buyers could provide a way for 
icahn to make his profit without having to worry about running 
the company 
actually icahns management has been paying off at both twa 
which he took over in january 1986 and acf a conglomerate he 
bought in 1984 and stripped down to its core railroadcar business 
airline industry analysts acknowledge that twa has recovered 
remarkably under icahn reporting its best earnings ever in 1987 
after a string of big losses but they also say he was lucky 
particularly in winning labor concessions from unions eager to 
escape texas airs frank lorenzo whom they perceived as antiunion 
in the end icahn is in it for himself primarily said louis 
a marckesano of janney montgomery scott inc i dont think he 
really cares what happens to twa in the future hes a financier 
who happens to own an airline 
icahn argues in response that twa would have been bankrupt if 
he hadnt come along sure we used a lot of leverage to do this 
thing but whats wrong with that basically we saved the 
airline 
indeed regardless of his intentions icahns financial wizardry 
often evokes praise 
the guy is a deal man one of the toughest negotiators 
youll ever see said john pincavage of painewebber inc we 
ought to use him against the russians i mean this guy is good

kraft inc said thursday it was selling its 
fastgrowing duracell battery division to a group led by management 
and the investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co in a cash 
deal worth 18 billion 
kraft said it agreed to sell duracell inc the worlds leading 
maker of alkaline consumer batteries to concentrate on its core 
food business 
proceeds from the sale would be used to buy back up to 12 
million kraft shares to reduce debt and for possible foodrelated 
acquisition the company said 
we are excited about the many opportunities available to 
kraft in the food industry and the sale of duracell will enable us 
to focus our total management and financial resources on those 
opportunities said kraft chairman john m richman 
kraft informed its shareholders of the definitive agreement at 
its annual meeting thursday in chicago kraft which acquired 
bethel connbased duracell in 1980 had announced in december 
that it planned to sell the unit 
henry r kravis a partner in new yorkbased kohlberg kravis 
called the agreement the first step in the creation of a great 
new independent consumerproducts company 
we are very excited about the future growth prospects of the 
company and our future association with the management and 
employees of duracell he said 
some analysts expressed surprise at the price kohlberg kravis 
agreed to pay for duracell which had been widely expected to fetch 
between 1 billion and 12 billion 
it never ceases to amaze me what a good brand is worth in 
todays marketplace said john w mcmillin of prudentialbache 
securities inc this was pleasant news for kraft shareholders 
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange kraft rose 
150 a share to close at 5350 
mcmillin said kohlberg kravis probably was attracted by 
duracells strong growth potential 
duracell which has about 9000 employees had an operating 
income of 140 million and sales of 11 billion last year krafts 
1987 sales excluding duracell were 99 billion 
duracells coppertop alkaline batteries account for about 28 
percent of all us consumer battery sales 
the company is tied with ralston purina cos eveready unit for 
the lead in domestic sales of alkaline batteries the 
fastestgrowing segment of the battery market 
together eveready and duracell have more than 80 percent of the 
domestic alkalinebattery market mcmillin said duracell does not 
compete in the carbonzinc battery market which is dominated by 
eveready 
with all these walkmans and portable tape recorders that have 
to use batteries the alkaline segment has been exhibiting strong 
volume growth and that is what had to attract these investors 
mcmillin said 
analysts said they did not expect duracell to diversify as a 
standalone company 
it could happen in time but certainly not immediately said 
lawrence adelman an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in new 
york 
when you do a leveraged buyout youve got to use the cash 
generated internally to reduce debt so youve got to pretty much 
stick to your own business 
duracell is being sold to duracell holdings corp the new 
company formed by kohlberg kravis and duracells management 
kohlberg kravis specializes in leveraged buyouts in which a 
company is acquired mainly through borrowed funds repaid from the 
target companys profits or asset sales

pork futures prices climbed sharply thursday on the chicago 
mercantile exchange as cash markets reflected strong demand for 
pork products and chart signals indicated the market was ripe for a 
rally 
most cattle futures also advanced 
on other markets energy futures were higher grains and 
soybeans were mixed gold gained slightly and stockindex futures 
retreated 
the movement of hogs to market this week has been running about 
equal to a year ago but slaughters are up and so are prices said 
tom ohare an analyst in new york with smith barney harris upham 
amp co 
today more than anythying i think the cash markets did a 
little better than most people had thought he said and with 
beef as high as it is i think retailers are probably going to be 
featuring more pork so the demand is there too 
technical factors also played a role in thursdays rally 
especially in the pork belly pit where prices have been trending 
lower due to a glut of frozen bellies 
cattle futures advaned on followthrough buying from wednesdays 
strong close steady cash markets and gave the cattle market 
additional support ohare said 
live cattle settled 05 cent to 55 cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in june at 7215 cents a pound feeder cattle 
were 08 cent lower to 30 cent higher with may at 7975 cents a 
pound hogs were 15 cent to 120 cents higher with june at 5165 
cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 28 cent lower to 120 
cents higher with may at 5237 cents a pound 
news reports of a fiery explosion at a shell oil co refinery in 
norco la boosted energy futures prices on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
that set the tone right off the bat with people buying 
gasoline outright as a supply hedge and as a speculative trade 
buying gasoline and selling crude against it said john azarow 
an analyst in new york with shearson lehman hutton inc 
the positive technical implications of thursdays higher opening 
and the june crude oil contracts close above 1737 a barrel 
should bode for higher prices azarow said 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent lower to 19 
cents higher with june at 1739 a barrel heating oil was 37 cent

the nations money supply grew sharply in the 
week ended april 25 the government reported thursday but the 
increase had no impact on financial markets and economists regarded 
it as largely inconsequential 
they attributed the rise to an unexpectedly higher rate of

taxpayer checks which inflated the categories of money included in 
the supply figures

117 billion to a seasonally adusted average of 778 billion from

and nonbank travelers checks 
a broader measure of money known as m2 averaged a 
seasonallyadjusted 2996 trillion up 51 billion from a week 
earlier m2 equals m1 plus accounts such as savings deposits and 
moneymarket mutual funds 
the broadest measure of the money supply called m3 averaged a 
seasonally adjusted 37635 trillion up 35 billion from the 
previous week m3 equals m2 plus lessliquid accounts such as 
certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of 100000 
in judging monetary policy the fed has indicated it is 
monitoring the value of the dollar commodity prices and the 
difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted attention from m1 to the two broader money supply measures 
in other reports 
the federal reserve bank of new york reported commercial and 
industrial loans at major new york banks rose 331 million in the 
week ended april 27 compared with a gain of 234 million the

reserve system averaged 575 million a day in the week ended

embattled teamsters president jackie presser 
is taking a leave of absence from the job just as a jurys verdict 
in the trial of a new york mob boss has set back federal efforts to 
oust him and other leaders of the nations largest union 
john r climaco the unions chief attorney said thursday that 
presser had advised the other 20 members of the teamsters 
executive board over the previous 24 hours that he will be 
temporarily unavailable for the next 120 days because of his 
health 
climaco said presser is hospitalized at the cleveland clinic in 
ohio where he is undergoing a new round of radiation treatments 
presser 61 underwent surgery in january 1987 for lung cancer 
and has not returned to work fulltime since then while undergoing 
a series of radiation and chemotherapy treatments 
however he has made several appearances at various union 
functions including the aflcios convention last october at which 
he gave an often rambling speech on the occasion of the teamsters 
reaffiliation with the labor federation after a 30year period 
in pressers absence the 16 millionmember union will be 
directed by secretarytreasurer weldon l mathis teamsters 
officials said presser was expected to keep receiving his salary 
now about 600000 annually they said 
meanwhile federal law enforcement officials acknowledged their 
efforts to wrest control of the teamsters from presser through a 
civil takeover suit was faltering under a jurys verdict wednesday 
in the trial of new york mob boss anthony salerno 
salerno was convicted of racketeering in the construction 
industry but was acquitted with two other reputed mob figures on 
charges of rigging the elections of roy williams and presser to the 
teamsters presidency in 1981 and 1983 
a federal law enforcement source speaking on condition of 
anonymity said salernos acquittal on the teamsterrelated counts 
was a serious setback 
because of the verdict the source said the government will have 
to conduct a major reevaluation of the prospects for bringing 
a civil suit to put a courtappointed trustee in charge of the 
union 
climaco said presser made the decision to step asie temporarily 
after he was told by his physicians to avoid stress conserve his 
health and undergo additional therapy 
however climaco answered not necessarily when asked if 
presser would seek another delay of his trial on federal charges of 
racketeering in connection with an alleged payrollpadding scheme 
at a teamsters local in cleveland that he also heads 
the trial already postponed several times because of pressers 
health is now scheduled to open in us district court in 
cleveland on july 12 
mr presser is looking forward to his july trial and hopes he 
will be physically able to stand trial so that he can once and for 
all vindicate himself climaco said 
presser is accused of participating in a scheme in which two men 
with alleged organized crime ties were placed on the cleveland 
locals payroll at a cost of 700000 over several years while 
performing no work for the union 
he has pleaded innocent to the charges and his attorneys have 
contended the fbi acquiesced in and even encouraged the employment 
of the two men in their use of presser as a government informant 
the justice and labor departments a year ago began preparing the 
teamsters takeover suit under the racketeer influenced and corrupt 
organizations rico act 
but federal prosecutors had delayed filing it out of concern the 
suit might prejudice salernos trial and the belief that his 
conviction would enhance their case for seizing control of the 
union 
john russell a justice department spokesman declined to 
comment on the outcome of the salerno case 
climaco however said the salerno verdict shatters once and 
forever the myth that the elections of presser and williams had 
been engineered and manipulated by organized crime elements 
the fbi and the department of justice know that at this time 
no such influence exists he said its a fiction pure 
fiction 
some teamsters officials nonetheless said they still feared 
rudolph giuliani the us attorney for manhattan would pursue a 
civil takeover attempt of their union

kaisertech ltd hampered by uncertainty 
over its control and a legal dispute with chairman alan clore said 
thursday its board of directors is considering selling the company 
the worlds fifthlargest aluminum producer said the board 
appointed a special committee of independent directors to consider 
proposals to acquire all of kaisertech after being informed that 
one or more such offers are expected 
kaisertechs stock jumped more than 2 in the first hour of 
trading on the new york stock exchange and closed up 287 at 18 
at least one of the acquisition proposals is expected to involve 
a leveraged buyout of the company in which its current management 
would be offered participation kaisertech said 
the oaklandbased kaiser aluminum amp chemical corp also said 
its board has adopted what it called a very limited 
stockholders rights plan designed to permit the directors and 
shareholders to consider a possible sale 
the board of directors believed that given the possibility as 
to the future direction of the company and given the 
possibility of protracted litigation it makes sense to explore the 
possibility of a transaction which would offer all of the companys 
stockholders a fair price for their stock said james pasman 
president and chief executive officer 
kaisertech filed suit last month against clore and the maxxam 
group investment group to resolve a dispute over rights to nominate 
directors the suit is part of an effort to block the financially 
troubled clore from passing on control of kaisertechs board to 
houston investor charles hurwitz who has agreed to buy clores 27 
percent voting stake for about 200 million 
kaisertechs management also has sued clore for alleged 
securitieslaw violations and a group of directors have sued him 
for alleged breach of contract both deal with his handling of 
company stock 
robert irelan a kaisertech spokesman cautioned that the board 
has not yet decided to sell the company despite forming the 
special committee

government lawyers are investigating possible 
perjury by officials during sworn testimony about a firms charge 
it was driven into bankruptcy by the justice department 
sources who spoke only on condition they not be identified said 
the justice departments public integrity section is examining 
conflicting testimony by two former federal bankruptcy trustees and 
justice department officials during a us bankruptcy court 
proceeding last year involving inslaw inc 
public integrity investigators also have allegations in the 
inslaw case against attorney general edwin meese iii those 
allegations were relayed to the public integrity lawyers by 
independent counsel james c mckay who has been investigating 
meese for almost a year 
we are not conducting an investigation with respect to the 
inslaw matter said carol bruce mckays deputy any 
information we have received relating to it we have referred to the 
justice departments public integrity section 
inslaw alleges that meese arranged to have their attorney leigh 
ratiner dismissed from his washington law firm in 1986 after meese 
discussed the case with one of ratiners partners leonard garment 
garment who described the allegation as pure baloney said 
he was interviewed by public integrity lawyers about the allegation 
two months ago 
if the public integrity section finds the allegations about 
meese are serious enough to warrant further investigation it would 
send them back to mckay according to a source close to the 
independent counsel 
the perjury investigation is the latest twist in a complicated 
case in which inslaw inc charged and a bankruptcy judge george 
f bason jr found that the justice department stole computer 
software the company had provided under a 10 million contract with 
the department 
bason ruled that the villain was a fired inslaw employee who 
went to work for the justice department with a consuming desire for 
revenge 
bason ordered the government to pay inslaw 68 million for use 
of the software he ruled last june that the justice department had 
engaged in trickery fraud and deceit to steal the software the 
case has been appealed 
lawyers for inslaw have alleged that cornelius blackshear a 
former us trustee lied in sworn depositions when questioned 
about an attempt to force inslaws liquidation sources said 
but the inquiry is focused on all the conflicting testimony in 
the case 
blackshear a bankruptcy judge in new york city changed his 
testimony about events that occurred when he was a us trustee in 
an affidavit and a second sworn deposition 
inslaw inc which filed for reorganization under bankruptcy 
law in early 1985 charged in another action before bason that the 
justice department had deliberately withheld 177 million in 
payments on the contract to computerize 94 us attorneys offices 
last year bason accepted inslaws contention that thomas j 
stanton head of the executive office of us trustees also tried 
to pressure blackshear into helping liquidate inslaws assets a 
move that would have put the company out of business 
when he announced his decision bason rejected stantons sworn 
denial of inslaws allegation that he had asked blackshear to send 
his chief deputy to washington to convert inslaws bankruptcy 
reorganization into a liquidation proceeing 
i found mr stantons testimony in crucial respects to be 
evasive and unbelievable the court simply finds that testimony 
to be utterly incredible and unworthy of belief said bason who 
left the bench earlier this year when his court appointment was not 
extended 
on march 25 1987 blackshear testified in the deposition that 
he refused stantons request because it was improper the next day 
blackshear signed an affidavit to retract the testimony stating 
that he was confusing inslaw with another bankruptcy matter 
blackshear gave a subsequent sworn deposition consistent with 
the affidavit both of the judges depositions were given in 
blackshears chambers he did not return a reporters repeated 
telephone calls 
bason noted that blackshear changed his testimony after 
receiving two telephone calls from william c white then the us 
bankruptcy trustee in alexandria va who allegedly refused 
stantons initial request to liquidate inslaw 
the inference is rather strong that mr white was trying to 
persuade judge blackshear that mr whites recollection was correct 
and judge blackshears recollection was incorrect bason said in 
his june 12 1987 ruling from the bench 
i believe that judge blackshears original testimony is 
accurate and his recanted testimony is inaccurate bason said 
calling the judges recantation an honest mistake 
bason also found that white may have mistakenly remembered 
events when he denied that stanton pressured white to liquidate 
inslaw bason ruled that people do have a capacity to forget 
things when it is painful for them to remember or maybe even 
inconvenient for them to remember 
the judge found there was clear and convincing evidence that 
stanton retaliated by whites refusal by refusing to expand whites 
staff in alexandria 
anthony pasciuto a former justice department official who also 
testified in the inslaw case meanwhile has provided a fresh 
allegation that blackshear lied when he retracted his first story 
pasciuto who had been stantons deputy director for 
administration charged that blackshear told him last summer i 
felt the easiest thing i could do was recant 
i felt less people would be hurt if i just bailed out 
blackshear was quoted as saying in a letter by pasciutos attorney 
gary simpson to the justice department 
i thought that by changing my story i would hurt less 
people simpson quoted blackshear as telling pasciuto 
pasciuto has since joined a new york financial firm he left the 
government after the justice departments office of professional 
responsibility tried to dismiss him for violating department rules 
by talking about the inslaw case with william hamilton the 
companys president and hamiltons wife nancy 
pasciuto told the hamiltons last year that he had information 
from blackshear about pressure to liquidate the firm but he 
retreated from this story during his courtroom testimony 
on the verge of tears in basons courtroom pasciuto had 
testified that he made up the story because he was angry with 
stanton about delaying his longawaited promotion 
simpson included the charge about blackshear in a march 17 
letter he wrote to thenassistant attorney general arnold i burns 
to protest plans to fire pasciuto who was allowed to resign 
the conflicting testimony of blackshear white stanton and 
pasciuto is the subject of the public integrity inquiry according 
to sources 
bason ruled that stanton sought to liquidate inslaw to curry 
favor with higher justice department officials after he spoke 
with c madison brewer who administered the inslaw contract his 
conduct has been the subject of a longstanding investigation by 
the departments office of professional responsibility 
in a subsequent ruling last year bason concluded that brewer 
was consumed by hatred and an intense desire for revenge 
because he had been fired by inslaw before going to work for the 
justice department 
bason ruled that brewer and others in the department stole 
enhancements to inslaws casetracking computer program known as 
promis and engaged in an outrageous deceitful fraudulent game 
of cat and mouse designed to destroy inslaw

the head of united airlines parent allegis corp 
dismissed as illusory thursday a new 4 billion buyout offer 
for the airline by a group led by its pilots 
stephen m wolf allegis chairman and chief executive officer 
said the buyout proposal was not in the best interest of the 
companys stockholders or employees and has no real prospect 
of being successful 
thus the price stated in the proposal is illusory and does 
not reflect the value of the airline wolf said 
wolf commented in a statement to all united employees from 
company headquarters in suburban elk grove village one day after 
the pilots made their third offer in a year proposing an employee 
takeover or restructuring of the carrier the company rejected the 
two previous offers 
the pilots offered to pay 110 cash per outstanding allegis 
share refinance certain allegis debts and accept wage cuts and 
other concessions to trim labor costs up to 350 million a year 
allegis stock fell 262 to 8737 a share thursday on the new 
york stock exchange 
the pilots group said the takeover would benefit stockholders 
and energize workers 
but wolf said that even if the takeover could be accomplished 
he did not see how employee ownership of a debtladen united 
benefits our pilots or other employees 
he said allegis had reacted to concerns raised by the pilots by 
selling its hotel and carrental businesses in order to concentrate 
on running the airline wolf also said it was time for employees to 
start working together with management rather than engage in 
rhetoric and divisiveness 
no one answered the telephone after business hours thursday at 
the suburban office of the pilots union the air lines pilot 
association only recordings answered the telephones at the home of 
an alpa spokesman james damron and at the unions national 
headquarters in washington 
william r howard who heads the corporation the pilots formed 
as a vehicle for the buyout had stated in a letter to wolf that 
the pilots bid offered allegis stockholders a significant premium 
over their shares current market value and would give employees an 
incentive to make united the nations leading airline 
but wolf said he believed most employees would not be interested 
in the buyout once they realized it would include substantial wage 
cuts and other multiyear concessions 
the wage cuts would impair uniteds ability to keep qualified 
workers at all levels he said 
wolf also said the heavy borrowing needed to finance the buyout 
would leave the airline unable to finance aircraft and other 
capital expenditures 
he said the airlines available credit and employee concessions 
should be used to expand the fleet provide new service and make 
the airline more competitive 
the proposed takeover would be financed through 31 billion in 
bank loans provided by a syndicate of banks led by chemical bank a 
600 million bank credit facility and the sale of 800 million in 
subordinated notes said howard the former chairman of piedmont 
aviation 
under the deal some pilots would take a 25 percent pay cut 
there also would be a reduction in company contributions to a 
pilots benefit plan and changes in compensation and workrules of 
noncontract employees

bank of new york co said late thursday it had 
reached agreement with more than twothirds of the holders of a 
class of irving bank corp preferred stock to modify antitakeover 
provisions contained in the issue 
bank of new york which has made a hostile 108 billion offer 
for irving stated that more than twothirds of the 15 shareholders 
had agreed to waive a provision that would prohibit irving from 
merging for three years with any company if the merged corporation 
did not meet certain restrictive requirements 
a twothirds majority was necessary to change the provisions 
the agreement would become effective only upon the election of 
bank of new yorks nominees to the irving board the statement 
said irving shareholders meet friday to vote on rival slates of 
board nominees proposed by irving and bank of new york 
irving issued the 1001 million of cumulative convertible 
preferred stock in an effort to bolster its takeover defenses and 
place a block of stock in friendly hands 
the owners of the new shares were given more voting rights than 
common stockholders with each of the preferred shares carrying 
1471 votes the new shares also contain convenants which irving 
said at the time of the issue could adversely affect the ability 
to accomplish any acquisition should they be breached 
among other things the covenants would require the merged bank 
to maintain relatively high levels of capital according to irving 
and they would restrict the companys ability to issue new stock 
a telephone call late thursday to irvings offices was not 
answered although the company in the past has indicated it 
believed bank of new yorks announcements on the matter were 
calculated to influence fridays proxy vote 
bank of new york is offering 15 in cash and 1575 shares of its 
stock for each of irvings 185 million outstanding shares 
irving supports a rival bid by banca commerciale italiana spa 
which is offering 75 a share bid for 95 million of the bank 
companys outstanding common shares 
irving fell 50 cents to 6037 a share thursday on the new york 
stock exchange bank of new york stock fell 12 cents to 3012 a 
share 
bank of new york stated that the pact with the preferred 
shareholders increased the likelihood that irving shareholders 
would not have to pay tax on the stock portion of its buyout offer 
the company said that under the agreement the preferred would 
pay a 95 percent annual dividend through feb 24 1993 after 
then the dividend would be determined by an auction mechanism
