senator negotiators agreed tuesday to boost 
the war on drugs to 94 billion capping a week of talks with the 
white house and lifting a republican blockade that stalled action 
on four money bills 
it seems that everything is worked out so we have an 
agreedupon package said sen robert c byrd dwva the chief 
senate negotiator 
as part of their deal republicans and democrats agreed that 
later this year the senate would consider elements of a 
crimefighting package unveiled by president bush in june but 
dormant since then 
with the agreement in hand the senate passed two of four 
appropriations bills that had been stalled by republicans for more 
than a week in a move to gain leverage in bargaining over the drug 
package 
within an hour the senate passed a 144 billion foreign aid 
measure and a 1574 billion bill for labor health and education 
programs 
the white house indicated its approval of the agreement earlier 
in the day before it was cemented presidential press secretary 
marlin fitzwater said the outlines of the plan appeared 
consistent with our objectives 
we do expect to accept this arrangement and hopefully we can 
get on with implementing the drug plan fitzwater said 
the negotiations began early last week after democrats proposed 
to add 22 billion to the 79 billion proposed by president bush 
in his sept 5 address to the nation on the scourge of drugs 
they said that education treatment and prevention programs were 
underfunded in the administrations battle plan for fighting the 
drug war 
the freshly minted package funds the bush administrations 
initial 79 billion war on drugs plus 400 million in other 
crimefighting money requested by the president in june as well as 
200 million for juvenile justice programs and the 900 million 
boost that had been the center of weeklong negotiations 
the 900 million would provide 100 million for law enforcement 
and the rest for prevention education and treatment the demand 
side of the drug war that democrats say was underfunded in the 
presidents original plan 
without building up the demand side then were really caught 
fighting the drug war with one hand behind us byrd said 
actually the 200 million for juvenile justice already was 
contained in a bill to provide money for the state commerce and 
justice departments moving them into the drug package raised the 
total added by the senate to 11 billion exactly half the amount 
that byrd initially had sought 
the increase would be funded through reductions in other 
spending programs that would be 043 percent if applied 
acrosstheboard under the plan however appropriations 
subcommittees would be able to pick and choose among programs 
allowing some to escape the full brunt of the cuts 
many elements of the presidents crimefighting package are 
contained in the drug strategy but some highly controversial 
elements are missing and the administration has been pushing for 
action on them 
they include applying the death penalty to a wider range of 
crimes than under current law 
another key provision would place limits on the number of 
appeals that could be filed by certain prisoners and a third would 
ease restrictions on how police and prosecutors obtain certain 
kinds of evidence

handicapped protesters who occupied a federal 
building for two days won a pledge of government support tuesday 
but failed to win an order requiring wheelchair lifts on all new 
public buses bought with federal funds 
the department of transportation cannot issue a summary order 
commanding immediate access including wheelchair access for all 
transit said steven diaz chief counsel for the urban mass 
transportation administration who met with the protest leaders 
we would if we could 
but diaz said dot officials and the protesters had agreed on 
three points 
transportation secretary samuel skinner will be urged to meet 
promptly with disabled activists to ensure a principle of 
accessibility until congress passes the americans with 
disabilities act 
the protesters will be allowed to continue a symbolic 
presence at the richard b russell building in downtown atlanta 
officials will relay to skinner the protesters concern that 
new rules for handicapped accessibility to air travel are not being 
drafted quickly enough 
this agreement by no means resolves the problem of access it 
just brings us a step closer said mark johnson 38 of 
alpharetta one of the protest leaders who met with diaz and other 
dot officials 
he said he didnt know if the protesters would leave the 
building where they blocked elevators and entrance doors earlier 
tuesday but by late tuesday it appeared the protesters had left 
none were visible inside the building 
we may stay here through thursday or we may just leave a 
sticker on the wall there could be a constant vigil at the 
building or we could all leave he said earlier 
the protest by members of adapt or american disabled for 
accessible public transportation began monday when skinner was in 
atlanta to address the convention of the american public 
transportation association at least two dozen protesters chained 
themselves to doors or blocked exits with their wheelchairs monday 
authorities attempted to eject several protesters from the 
building monday evening but president bush intervened and let them 
spend the night inside rather than send them out into the rain 
on tuesday the protesters made good on a threat to block 
entrances to the buildings main level at noon if their demands 
were not met by then 
about two hours later while federal officials met with protest 
leaders outside the building about 160 chanting singing activists 
kept federal employees and visitors from using 12 of the 14 
mainfloor elevators by blocking them with wheelchairs 
security officers were able to keep two elevators open by using 
plant stands to keep wheelchairs away from them 
about 100 protesters spent monday night in the building eating 
takeout food and sleeping under blankets provided by attendants 
early tuesday a group of atlanta bartenders brought them coffee 
and doughnuts 
it was an uncomfortable night said rick james 39 of salt 
lake city but he added the misery that were going through is 
worth it if we get what we want all we are asking for is a lift on 
every bus so that we can be more independent were not asking for 
a million dollars 
but government officials have estimated that putting wheelchair 
lifts on all new public buses would cost 90 million a year 
adapt also has been trying to force the installation of lifts on 
all new buses through the courts in philadelphia a federal 
appeals court panel backed their lawsuit saying federal law 
requires lifts on new buses 
but in july the full 3rd us circuit court of appeals 
overturned that ruling saying government officials did not have to 
put lifts on all buses if they thought some other method of serving 
the handicapped would be better 
michael churchill an attorney for adapt said the group was 
waiting to see what congress did on the bus issue before deciding 
whether to appeal

a washington teenager was arrested tuesday on 
charges of selling the crack cocaine that president bush displayed 
on television to illustrate the seriousness of the nations drug 
problems 
keith jackson 18 was indicted earlier in the day by a federal 
grand jury on four counts of unlawfully distributing crack and one 
count of using a telephone to help arrange an alleged sale 
the alleged distribution started in april on one occasion near 
eastern high school in washington in july according to the 
indictment 
jackson was picked up at his home in southeast washington by 
city police and drug enforcement administration agents said dea 
spokesman cornelius dougherty 
us magistrate pattrick attridge ordered jackson held without 
bond pending another hearing wednesday 
in a sept 5 televised speech bush held up a clear plastic bag 
containing a handful of crack nuggets and said they had been seized 
across the street from the white house a few days previously 
the alleged dealer was lured to lafayette park not one of 
washingtons drug markets four days before by undercover drug 
agents after white house staffers asked for a sample from the 
vicinity of the white house to show that dealing could happen 
anywhere 
officials of the dea said they had planned to make the purchase 
a few blocks away before the white house request 
the transaction with an undercover dea agent was photographed 
but the dealer was not taken into custody then because agents hoped 
he would sell a larger amount later and identify his supply 
organization officials said 
a planned arrest last week fell through when the suspect did not 
show up

with thousands of east germans going west in the 
past few months those staying behind have found themselves without 
the services of some important people from the village baker to 
the town plumber to medical specialists 
there are visible signs of the people drain in east berlin 
an official sign on a shuttered bar called restoration 1900 
says the establishment has received permission to close because 
the manager is ill 
local residents say that in truth the manager fled to west 
germany two months ago 
an operator of three other bars in this area also went west a 
while back hes since been replaced said a middleage east 
german walking past the bar on the citys husemannstrasse 
a vegetable shop a few blocks away is shuttered as well and 
residents say its owner also has gone to the west 
east german reform activist jens reich says his eye doctor has 
fled to west germany i fear my dentists gone as well said 
reich an east berlin founder of the fledgling new forum 
prodemocracy group 
about 100000 east germans have either fled or emigrated legally 
to west germany this year the greatest flood of east german 
refugees since the berlin wall went up in 1961 more than 17500 of 
them have gone through hungary since that country opened its 
western border to east germans sept 10 
the refugees say they left their homeland because they could no 
longer bear the lack of democratic freedoms and because they want 
better lives in the west 
the exodus has produced a new rash of demands for political and 
economic reform among many east germans who remain behind within 
two weeks of the exodus reichs group collected signatures of more 
than 2000 citizens supporting its prodemocracy demands 
church officials in east germany have intensified their calls 
for democratic change as well they say leaving the country is no 
way to change it 
someone who is in bavaria cannot be of service to a patient at 
the catholic hospital in erfurt east germany east german roman 
catholic bishop joachim wanke has said 
sources within the ruling communist party speaking on condition 
of anonymity said the drain of medical personnel is so severe in 
the district of suhl that doctors there have been forbidden to 
travel out of the country 
officials have not released any figures on how the exodus has 
affected medical care or any other professions or businesses 
the west german frankfurter rundschau newspaper said sept 18 it 
was told by church officials a number of hospitals have had to 
replace employees ranging from student nurses to chief physicians 
the refugees who have fled west in the past few months are 
mostly young people who left behind good jobs and in many cases 
promising careers 
according to a study released sept 12 by west germanys 
ministry for innergerman relations the refugees worked in 
industry medicine and other servicesector areas crafts 
administration and education 
east germany has a population of 166 million no one has said 
the refugee exodus means economic disaster but the communist 
leadership has acknowledged it is causing problems 
residents across the country have reported that some department 
stores are operating with drastically reduced staffs many gas 
stations are shortening their work days and other establishments 
are closing down completely 
the frankfurter rundschau said that at times cynical humor 
takes over when those left behind talk about employees who have 
gone west 
a hairdresser in erfurt coolly tells a customer so you want 
to make an appointment with bettina then youd better call passau 
or make a complaint to west german chancellor helmut kohl 
said rundschau

the city leaped at a chance to put 
its frog crossing signs back up and the mayor even thinks hes 
figured out a way to keep souvenir hunters from slipping away with 
them 
i am going to have a tshirt made of the frogcrossing sign 
mayor scott schultz said after the signs were reposted last week 
maybe if we get people to buy tshirts they wont steal the 
sign 
the two signs have been missing since shortly after they were 
erected in july 1987 on a stretch of road through the schmeeckle 
reserve suspicious minds linked the signs disappearance with the 
return of students that year to the university of wisconsinstevens 
point 
the signs were posted along two ramps that were cut in the curb 
to help frogs and other small animals cross the road 
a city worker came up with the design featuring four frogs in 
various stages of leaping 
recently one of the original signs was recovered and repaired 
and officials decided to give it another try 
the general reaction is that folks are glad the sign is back 
up schultz said the real purpose was to highlight that there 
is a nature preserve 
when the first signs disappeared so quickly official decided it 
would be pointless to keep putting them up in a battle with 
souvenirhunters 
this time tshirts arent the only deterrent to theft schultz 
said they welded the bolts this time

a million refugees have flooded back into 
beirut after six months of fighting many impoverished by their 
ordeal and some fearful lest the savage shelling flares up again 
long lines of cars began streaming into the shattered capital 
within minutes of the announcement friday by christian leader gen 
michel aoun that he was accepting an arab league ceasefire 
hundreds more lebanese booked passage for the threehour ferry 
crossing from larnaca cyprus to the christian port of jounieh 
while others flew into the newly reopened beirut airport 
the six months of fighting killed at least 929 people and 
wounded 2741 
issam baydoun a sunni moslem bank employee who fled during the 
shelling battles that pitted aouns mainly christian fighters 
against syria and its moslem militia allies was among the 
returnees 
i have spent most of my 30 years savings during the 2 months 
of forced migration to the south said the 55yearold father of 
two 
baydoun said he fled his beirut home in a sevenstory apartment 
building in the heavily shelled district of ras elnabeh in july 
when things could not be borne anymore 
my wife had started taking sedatives he said my daughter 
screamed every time a shell crashed nearby or because of the sound 
of a rocket passing overhead 
just like many other west beirutis baydoun headed south he 
rented a tworoom house for 900 a month in iqlim kharroub in the 
chouf mountains 
in all i spent 3000 in only 75 days of exile he said 
believe me now that were back i cant afford to restore my 
shellpocked house 
asked whether he would be able to rent another house in the 
south if fighting broke out again baydoun said 
i am a conscientious employee and have a good reputation at 
the bank the bank manager might be willing to lend me some money 
on temporary basis but to tell you the truth god knows when i 
will be able to pay him back 
he was glad to be back albeit impoverished saying theres no 
place like home 
the baydouns neighborhood is in a section of west beirut where 
syria and its allies installed their advance artillery batteries 
on the opposite side are aouns troops as well as christian 
militants from the lebanese forces 
east beirut residents also breathed relief when the arab league 
commitee announced the opening of all crossings linking both 
sectors of the capital the lifting of the 6monthold blockade of 
the christian heartland and the opening of the airport 
may god guide them to the right path said samira gobril a 
maronite catholic housewife who expressed hope that the leaders of 
lebanons factions would work together for a durable peace 
may god keep utmost in their minds the plight of the poor 
population 
mrs gobril 38 and mother of an 11yearold boy and an 
8yearold girl lives in the frequently battered christian area of 
ashrafieh a few miles from the green line that divides east from 
west beirut 
she had fled to the fashionable mountain resort of faraya 20 
miles to the northeast 
this time we could afford it she added but itll take my 
husband five years of hard work to recoup the amount of money we 
have spent during the last four months 
police said at least 1 million refugees who fled beirut have 
returned since friday beirut took the brunt of the shelling 
forcing all but 150000 of its remaining 15 million people to flee 
some of those that did not travel to safer areas of lebanon took 
the ferry to cyprus either to wait out the fighting or to apply 
for american canadian australian and other visas as a gateway to 
a new life away from their country shattered by 14 years of civil 
war 
estimates vary immigration officials in cyprus say about 20000 
lebanese are on the small east mediterranean island whose 
population numbers just 691000 
but relief agency officials working to ease the refugees plight 
said the actual number of lebanese in cyprus probably reached 
30000 at the height of the fighting and perhaps more 
the christian refugees only exit to the outside world has been 
through a hydrofoil ferry service from the port of jounieh north of 
beirut to larnaca on the south cyprus coast 
moslems too have been fleeing to cyprus though they are still 
a minority of the lebanese refugees on the island

a bomb exploded monday night in the 
cartagena hilton on the caribbean and reports said two doctors were 
killed and another was wounded the chief of the police in that 
coastal resort said 
another bomb exploded at a cartagena bank monday night injuring 
a passerby col luis herrera told the associated press in a 
telephone interview 
a fireman at the hotel told a colombian tv news crew the blast 
ripped through the sixth floor of the cartagena hilton whose 
majority owner is the colombian governments national tourism 
council 
the bomb exploded in room 642 the colombian radio chain caracol 
said in a report from the scene the two doctors who were killed 
were attending a medical convention at the hotel caracol said 
their identities were not immediately available 
the one who was injured was also thought to be colombian 
witnesses told caracol 
herrera said no one had claimed responsibility for the bombs 
however colombian government security forces have presumed that 
scores of bombs that have exploded in major colombian cities in the 
last month have been the work of drug traffickers who declared war 
on the colombian government 
including the two bombs in cartagena and one monday night in the 
capital of bogota there have been 110 bombings killing eight 
persons and injuring 132 persons 
the hilton was evacuating the approximately 1500 guests to 
other hotels in cartagena caracol said quoting its correspondent 
who filed a report by radio telephone with bogota 
thousands of americans canadians and other foreigners flock to 
cartagena each year 
a group of canadian tourists at the cartagena airport last week 
told the wife of an ap reporter they were cutting their vacations 
short and going home because the canadian embassy warned them of 
the war possibly spreading to cartagena 
police told the ap the third bomb was at a billing office of the 
government electric company in bogota but that no one was reported 
injured 
it was the first time bombs hit cartagena since drug traffickers 
declared war on the colombian government last month 
a leading presidential candidate was quoted earlier monday as 
saying colombia may have to legalize drugs in order to fight the 
powerful cartels waging war on the government 
also monday two politicians said the government should 
negotiate with drug lords 
representatives of the nations 4600 judges were to meet with 
the acting justice minister carlos lemos simmonds the judges 
threatened sunday to go on strike unless simmonds promised them 
better protection from drug cartels who persistently threaten 
their lives 
since 1981 about 50 judges and 170 judicial employees have been 
killed mostly by drug traffickers 
justice department spokesman david runkel said in washington 
that us officials sent 100 bulletproof vests and other security 
items to colombia last week to help protect judges he said it was 
the responsibility of colombian officials to distribute the items 
four bombs exploded sunday night in bogota but there were no 
injuries national police said 
sen ernesto samper seeking the government liberal partys 
nomination for the presidential election in march said of the drug 
war if the repressive action fails the road left is 
legalization of drugs 
samper made the comment in an interview published monday by the 
bogota daily la republica he is the first serious presidential 
candidate to suggest legalizing drugs 
the government began its crackdown on the drug cartels when 
leading presidential candidate luis carlos galan was assassinated 
aug 18 at a bogota political rally 
president virgilio barco who by law cannot run for reelection 
said he would extradite drug lords to the united states prompting 
the cartels to declare war on the government 
there have been reports the traffickers are willing to pay 
billions of dollars to get the government to end its crackdown but 
barco has refused to negotiate 
the mayor of the city of medellin juan gomez said monday that 
after this war is over and there are many dead we are going 
to end up at the negotiating table talking with the drug 
traffickers 
the dialogue would be christian because it would avoid many 
deaths the mayor said in an interview with caracol 
also coming out monday in favor of negotiations was the 
president of the house of representatives or lower chamber of 
parliament norberto morales 
we have to open the way toward this initiative because we are 
bleeding to death and our economy is in ruins morales told 
caracol 
on saturday morales said two of colombias major drug 
trafficking suspects had called him with an offer to negotiate with 
the government he said he passed the information along to barco 
pablo escobar and gonzalo rodriguez gacha offered to invest 
millions of dollars from their cocaine profits in colombian 
industry if a truce is reached morales said 
government officials have said in the past that drug traffickers 
apparently invest the bulk of their money outside colombia 
escobar and rodriguez gacha are on the justice departments list 
of most wanted drugtrafficking suspects they are the strongest 
members of the medellin cocaine cartel which is said to supply 80 
percent of the cocaine reaching the united states 
the traffickers have made earlier offers 
recently a us narcotics official with the embassy in bogota 
said in an interview that the traffickers want pardons so they can 
emerge from years of hiding 
in return the official said the traffickers apparently offered 
to move their operations to other countries possibly bolivia or 
peru 
also he said the traffickers suggested they would finance much 
of the governments 30yearold war against leftist guerrillas 
the biggest offer from the traffickers came in 1984 when the 
medellin cartel offered to pay off colombias foreign debt then 
about 10 billion in exchange for amnesty the government refused

investigators hope columbias next 
scheduled space mission wont be delayed by damage caused by a 
surge of fire protection water that sprayed the shuttle 
i have not given up launching on the 18th said thomas e 
utsman deputy director of the kennedy space center who heads the 
investigation into sundays accident columbia is scheduled for 
liftoff on dec 18 
utsman said monday the problem started when a valve failed and 
then two workers in their haste to shut off the system mistakenly 
turned on most of the sprinklers 
im chalking it up to a combination of equipment error and 
human error he said the guys who did it were only trying to 
help good intentions sometimes go wrong 
as many as 200 of the shuttles 500 woven fiberglass heat 
shields may have to be replaced he said the blankets about the 
size of a beach towel protect the top of the shuttle 
the thermal blankets are our major concern utsman said 
he said initial inspection revealed no damage to any of the more 
than 20000 silica thermal tiles these are much smaller and 
tougher than the blankets and are bonded to side and bottom areas 
of the shuttle subjected to the highest heat 
while there appeared to be no damage to electrical or electronic 
systems we wont know for sure until we power up the vehicle 
utsman said 
he said investigators should know within a few days if the 
launch will be delayed 
if we have to replace only a couple hundred blankets there 
shouldnt be a hit utsman said 
utsman said the accident occurred sunday after three workers 
performed routine maintenance on the water sprinkler system in the 
building where the shuttle was being processed 
when the workers finished the job they tested the system by 
pressurizing it but a gate valve that they were certain was closed 
failed and water began flowing from sprinklers in one of six safety 
zones 
two other workers who tried to help inadvertently turned on 
the other sprinklers and water poured onto work platforms and 
splashed onto the shuttle utsman said other workers were able to 
quickly turn off the water 
he did not know the amount of water released 
he said a small amount of water leaked into the closed cargo bay 
but didnt damage electronic systems there he said no water 
entered the crew cabin

east german leader erich honecker 
appeared in public for the first time six weeks after gallbladder 
surgery putting to rest rumors he was gravely ill but facing a 
crisis posed by an exodus to the west 
west german officials say the number of east germans that have 
fled to the west since hungary opened the floodgates on sept 11 
has surpassed 20000 
as communist east germany nears its 40th anniversary its 
leaders say they are discussing reforms that could stop the flow of 
refugees to the west a phenomenon that is draining the countrys 
labor pool 
the 77yearold honecker resumed some official duties monday as 
about 8000 people demonstrated in leipzig to protest his 
governments refusal monday to grant legal status to a 
prodemocracy group called new forum 
leipzig police arrested scores of demonstrators many of whom 
sang we shall overcome and shouted such slogans as liberty 
equality fraternity 
east germanys staterun news agency adn said honecker who had 
not been seen in public since aug 14 resumed some official duties 
on monday meeting with the new ambassadors of zimbabwe and turkey 
east german communist party sources said the party chief was 
expected to fully resume his duties by oct 7 when the country 
marks its 40th anniversary soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
is expected in east berlin for the ceremonies 
after his midaugust surgery some west german media reports 
said honeckers condition may have been more serious than indicated 
by east german officials and that he had lost the will to live 
the east german leadership has been hampered by honeckers 
protracted recovery leading one communist party official to call 
the country a ship without a captain 
west german media have said that some east german communist 
leaders have accused honecker of misjudging the meaning and scope 
of the exodus to west germany which grants east germans automatic 
citizenship because its constitution does not recognize the 
division of germany 
honecker a hardline communist who has led east germany since 
1971 has staunchly resisted reforms sweeping much of the soviet 
bloc 
as of early monday 20130 east germans had fled through hungary 
to west germany since the channel to the west was opened west 
german border police said 
in addition more than 1200 east german refugees waited in 
cramped west german embassy compounds in prague and warsaw hoping 
a diplomatic solution could be worked out to allow them to get to 
the west 
east and west german officials spoke several times by telephone 
monday trying to reach a compromise on the embassy occupations 
said herbert schmuelling a west german government spokesman 
bonn is hoping to find a quick solution and the talks are in a 
highly sensitive phase schmuelling told reporters 
in stuttgart west germany the communist party chief for the 
east german city of dresden said he thinks changes are needed to 
stop east germans from leaving their homeland 
hans modrow said he agreed with a recent remark by retired east 
german intelligence chief markus wolf that the east german 
government must think over the causes of the east german exodus 
on this point i am of the same opinion as my friend mischa 
wolf modrow said on the first day of a fourday visit to west 
germany 
modrow however refused to say what kind of reforms are needed 
in east germany this is something we have to discuss at home 
not here he said 
the number of east germans occupying west german embassies in 
prague czechoslovakia and warsaw poland has nearly reached its 
saturation point west german government sources said 
about 980 east germans have sought refuge inside the prague 
compound and 300 at the embassy in warsaw the sources said their 
numbers have grown by 50 to 100 per day over the past week

us rep roy dyson admitted to mistakes 
in judgment during a speech announcing his reelection and 
promised to return 18000 in campaign contributions from people 
linked to a defense contractor 
dyson also said monday he would take ultimate responsibility 
for the embezzlement of 7275 of his former top aide who 
committed suicide in may 1988 by jumping from a new york hotel 
mistakes were made by my staff i have made mistakes of 
judgment the fiveterm democrat told several hundred supporters 
i regret the controversy these matters have caused but i want 
the people of maryland to know that these were mistakes of the 
head not of the heart 
dyson a member of the house armed services procurement 
subcommittee said he was returning the contributions from 
employees and consultants for unisys which is under investigation 
by the us justice department for possible contract procurement 
violations 
i am returning these funds because individual pleas entered as 
part of the justice departments ill winds investigation point to 
a systematic attempt on the part of unisys to circumvent the 
federal laws governing campaign contributions said dyson 
the investigation involves charges that defense firms or their 
employees hired private consultants who bribed pentagon officials 
for information needed to win multimilliondollar contracts 
the congressman also said he would donate to charity a 2000 
speaking fee he received from the oshkosh trucking co on the day 
he voted in favor of a bill that benefited the company 
dyson said he will report the apparent violations in accepting 
the speaking fee to the federal elections commission 
because of these errors i anticipate that the fec will levy a 
fine which the campaign will pay to the fec as a civil penalty for 
the violations dyson said 
dyson also told supporters that the late thomas pappas his 
former top aide had improperly pocketed 7275 in campaign funds 
i must accept ultimate responsibility for these errors in 
judgment because tom pappas was my campaign manager dyson said 
i was not aware that tom was writing checks to staff members and 
asking them to cash those checks and return the cash to him 
luis luna an attorney who describes himself as an all but 
declared republican candidate for dysons seat said the 
congressmans admissions were welcomed but didnt go far enough in 
explaining his connection to unisys

president bush wants a consensus on improving 
schools at the education summit starting wednesday not more funds 
for a basically wellfed system but some governors say more 
money is a key issue 
i dont think youre going to find a consensus on the issue 
of money said iowa gov terry branstad a republican who chairs 
the national governors association 
bush and several key republican governors are adamant that the 
two days of discussions at the university of virginia in 
charlottesville va will not focus on more money for schools 
the educational system is basically wellfed but its 
undernourished and we must find innovative accountable ways to 
improve performance the president told reporters at a recent 
briefing 
however a key concern of some governors particularly 
democrats is that without a federal financial commitment the 
states and local governments will be forced to reshuffle scarce 
cash or impose higher taxes 
we have enormous problems to surmount if we are to educate our 
children and we need a real federal commitment to that effort not 
just rhetoric said massachusetts gov michael dukakis a 
democrat who said that during the reagan administration the federal 
share of school funds fell to 6 percent from 9 percent 
the real problem for the federal government and the president 
is how do you shift resources for greater investment instead of 
ending up simply lecturing people on things they ought to do 
without any real help said michigan gov james blanchard a 
democrat 
i am hopeful we will see some increased federal funding for 
education added south dakota gov george mickelson a 
republican but the federal government needs to balance its 
budget i think they are going to rather than give us a whole lot 
of money begin to set an agenda and hold us accountable in the 
spending of the money 
states already are pumping huge sums into education for 
example virginia spent 4069 per pupil in 198788 up from 1524 
per pupil in 197879 nevada gov bob miller a democrat said that 
over the past 10 years state financial support for public schools 
has risen by more than 100 percent 
branstad said i think there is a feeling that there is 
considerable amount of money being spent on education we want to 
spend it as wisely as possible 
bush who vowed to be the education president has indicated 
a willingness to free states from cumbersome federal rules that 
dictate how some federal funds are spent 
democratic gov rudy perpich of minnesota said it would be a 
mistake for governors to hammer bush at the meeting for federal 
funding but he stressed he would like more federal money for 
preschool programs such as head start 
according to perpich the money for basic kindergarten through 
12th grade education should be provided by states 
alaska gov steve cowper a democrat agreed in terms of 
federal funding my biggest priority is for the federal government 
to expand head start so that every eligible child has an 
opportunity to enroll 
educators said only about 20 percent of the eligible students 
are served by the head start program that cost the government 12 
billion last year bush has proposed a 250 million increase 
money could overshadow discussions on other topics such as 
allowing parents to choose which public school their children will 
attend restructuring the learning environment revitalizing the 
teaching profession and the proper role of government in education 
the parental choice issue is the centerpiece of bushs education 
initiatives and conservatives want the president to promote the 
issue by challenging the governors to advance the idea at home 
education secretary lauro cavazos said the issue of equity 
and transportation are key to the issue of choice asked who 
would pay for school buses to take children to the school of their 
parents choice he said its going to be a statebystate 
solution and its going to be worked out

breaks bill garlands heart 
garland is a sales representative for the tension envelope 
corp a firm which produces about onefifth of all the envelopes 
used by the direct mail industry his territory is central ohio and 
he singlehandedly sells 100 million envelopes a year enough to

a plain brown envelope is insane said garland the 
biggest opportunity for blowing the products whistle is lost 
he stood before a display of envelopes that were anything but 
plain some had rippled edges zippers to the trade that all 
but compel the recipient to open the envelope which is the point 
the latest wrinkle in envelopes is one in which the address flap 
flips over allowing the recipient to reply using the original 
envelope 
it saves storage space garland explained if you insert a 
return envelope into the outgoing envelope and youre using a 
million envelopes a month youve got to find space for 2 million 
envelopes not 1 million

few viewers are seeing it yet but the auto 
industry already is crying foul over a public service ad on global 
warming that environmentalists are sending to radio and tv stations 
nationwide 
and detroit wants equal time 
the ad was unveiled a week ago by the environmental action 
foundation which said it was distributing the 30second spots to 
hundreds of radio and television stations to spread the warning 
about global warming and specifically what part the automobile 
plays 
thomas h hanna president of the motor vehicle manufacturers 
association quickly dispatched a letter to 200 tv stations and 850 
radio stations calling the ad clearly political and full of 
misinformation 
he wrote that if the environmentalists spots are used as a 
public service announcement we intend to demand equal time to 
rebut the misinformation and misleading material they contain 
on monday ruth caplan executive director of the 
washingtonbased environmental group distributed a copy of hannas 
letter at a news conference and accused the industry group of 
trying to muzzle public education on the environmental impact of 
automobiles 
she characterized the industrys call for equal time as 
ludicrous and denied the thrust of the 30second advertisement 
which calls pollution from automobiles a major cause of global 
warming is misleading 
in a telephone interview hanna defended his sept 19 letter to 
the radio and tv stations 
hanna charged the environmentalists were misusing free air time 
under public service provisions by making a political statement and 
advancing their legislative agenda thats grass roots 
lobbying 
he maintained the ad overstates the threat of global warming 
which he said was still disputed in the scientific community and 
puts too much of the blame on pollution from us automobiles 
carbon dioxide which is released in the burning of fossil 
fuels is a major contributor to the socalled greenhouse 
effect the creation of a gaseous veil in the atmosphere 
scientists are concerned that if accumulation of these 
greenhouse gases goes unchecked the earth may warm 
significantly by the middle of the next century 
us automobiles however are only one source of carbon dioxide 
and are believed to be the source of only about 25 percent of all 
the greenhouse gases worldwide according to the environmental 
protection agency nevertheless a reduction of carbon dioxide 
emissions from motor vehicles and other sources is widely seen as 
essential to reducing the global warming threat 
the environmental groups 30second spot opens with a shot 
directly into the sun and the announcer calling global warming a 
disease of the earth it quickly pans a desert landscape and then 
shifts to highway and city streets clogged with cars and trucks 
while the announcer says a major cause of global warming is 
pollution from automobiles 
we need more fuel efficient cars continues the announcer 
over a scene of a family with its car followed by a closeup of 
arid parched earth 
hanna said he would not object if the spots were run as paid 
advertisements that give a point of view but said the 
environmentalists should not be given free air time 
detroit spends millions of dollars each year to advertise 
their new model cars and light trucks replied ms caplan for 
the industry to request free air time to respond to our modest 
public education campaign is ludicrous 
hanna said there are no plans to prepare a counterad in case 
equal time is granted by a tv or radio operator but he said 
spokesmen would be available to make people aware theres another 
point of view

a republican hispanic says conditions for 
hispanic youth arent as bad as described by a federal study and by 
bush administration officials 
linda chavez who served at the us civil rights commission 
during the reagan administration provoked strong disagreement with 
her testimony at a hearing on hispanic children monday by the house 
select committee on children youth and families 
she disputed remarks education secretary lauro cavazos made last 
week when he released a report on school dropouts and said the rate 
among hispanic students is a national tragedy 
the future looks quite good for individual hispanics said 
chavez 
nativeborn hispanics despite the ominous report from the 
department of education appear to be staying in school longer 
she said 
she challenged the statistical basis for the report and said the 
departments finding like other statistical studies of hispanics 
were skewed by large influxes of recent immigrants arriving at a 
rate she estimated at 400000 a year 
chavez said hispanic immigrants will eventually move into the 
economic mainstream as have earlier european immigrants who also 
faced high dropout rates in their first generations 
the studies diminish the very real and significant progress 
of hispanics in this country 
her remarks put her at odds however with a panel of hispanic 
experts appearing with her before the committee who cited severe 
poverty and education problems among hispanics 
shes not right said ann rosewater staff director of the 
committee following the hearing they other expert witnesses 
made a very clear point theres lots of research showing not just 
first generation but second and third generation hispanics are 
not doing well in school 
raul hinojosa of the university of california at berkeley said 
hispanics of varying national origins are falling further behind 
economically he said hispanics have been hurt by discrimination 
low educational achievement and changes in the national labor 
market that have reduced the availability of middleincome jobs 
he said the higher fertility rate among hispanics is a more 
important factor than the arrival of recent immigrants 
committee chairman george miller dcalif said hispanics face 
severe poverty and incredible disparity with other ethnic 
groups regardless of the statistics used 
the numbers are overwhelming he said 
chavez is a senior fellow with the manhattan institute for 
policy research a conservative new york research organization and 
is a former unsuccessful republican candidate for the senate from 
maryland

some sixthgraders say they use cocaine as 
often as every week according to a survey released today that 
shows an alarming trend of drug use among junior high school 
students 
at the same time illicit use of drugs and alcohol declined 
among high school students according to the nonscientific survey 
of almost 400000 secondary school students by the national 
parents resource institute for drug education 
whereas we have seen some drops in drug use at the upper 
grades at the lower grades there is an alarming trend of more 
use said doug hall vice president of pride 
dr thomas j gleaton jr president of the atlantabased drug 
prevention organization that has been conducting the nationwide 
surveys since 1982 said the study detected weekly cocaine use in 
the sixth grade 
of the 29116 sixthgraders who responded to the question about 
cocaine use about 233 said they used cocaine weekly or daily 
according to the report about 58 sixthgraders said they used 
cocaine once or twice a month and another 87 sixthgraders said 
they used cocaine one to six times a year the survey found 
the survey covered 392003 students in grades 6 to 12 who 
answered the anonymous questionnaire given in 958 schools in 38 
states according to pride 
overall for junior high students of the 161907 who responded 
to the question on cocaine use 07 percent or 1133 said they used 
it weekly or daily an equal number used it infrequently and 648 
said they used it once or twice a month 
the study showed 249 percent of junior high school students 
said they had drunk an alcoholic beverage this year two years ago 
263 percent said they had done so and in 198485 212 percent 
said they had 
in senior high school grades 912 the use of cocaine 
marijuana beer and liquor declined from the levels of two and four 
years ago the study found 
a total of 46 percent of the 223036 students in grades 912 
who responded to the question on cocaine use said they used the 
drug this year compared with 57 percent four years ago and 64 
percent two years ago the pride survey found of the 10260 this 
year who said they used cocaine 2900 said they used it weekly or 
daily according to the report 
the national high school seniors survey released in february 
also found that drug abuse among high school seniors declined last 
year reaching its lowest level since 1975 that survey by the 
university of michigans institute for social research found that 
the proportion of seniors who have used cocaine at least once in 
their lifetime dropped from 15 percent in 1987 to 12 percent in 
1988 
gleaton said only 22 percent of the senior class of 1989 was 
drugfree with the other 78 percent saying they had used a drug or 
alcoholic beverage in the previous year 
it is a matter of grave concern to the nation that thousands 
of young and promising brains are being impaired daily said dr 
gabriel g nahas of columbia universitys college of physicians and 
surgeons who is prides medical advisor 
cigarette smoking while not considered a drug by pride gained 
popularity in all the grades surveyed with 387 percent of high 
school students and 281 percent of junior high school students 
saying they had smoked a cigarette increases over both two and 
four years ago 
extrapolating from the survey pride estimated that 690000 
american students in grades 612 tried cocaine last year and about 
223000 used cocaine weekly or daily pride did not provide a 
margin of error for this estimate however

president bushs chemical weapons proposal 
might play in moscow but his call for a global ban is not likely to 
get much of a hearing in libya and iran which are thought to 
possess the grisly substances experts say 
addressing the un general assembly in new york on monday bush 
proclaimed readiness to destroy 80 percent of us chemical weapons 
if moscow follows suit and urged other nations to sign a 
multilateral pact to outlaw them entirely 
bushs proposal made virtue of necessity said one senior 
senator because in 1985 congress passed a law requiring the 
destruction of all old chemical weapons by 1997 while authorizing 
production of a new generation 
i consider it a good positive move said sen sam nunn 
dga chairman of the senate armed services committee getting 
the soviets to join in would be very good and if both superpowers 
lead the way bilaterally i think it will give some impetus to the 
overall world move in that direction which is the ultimate 
objective 
the united states and soviet union are the only two states to 
acknowledge having chemical weapons although bush said that as 
many as 20 nations possess or have the capability of producing them 
experts have estimated up to a dozen nations can make chemical 
weapons there was no explanation from the white house for the 
figure of 20 bush used 
delegates to the 40nation conference on disarmament ended their 
most recent meeting in geneva last month without any indication of 
an agreement on a chemical weapons ban 
the conference which meets again in november is stalled on the 
issue of how to monitor the production of chemical weapons which 
experts say can be made in factories similar to those that make 
fertilizer or other compounds 
also in dispute are the size of chemical weapons stockpiles and 
even the number of countries that have them 
the extent of the us stockpile is classified although private 
analysts estimate it at 30000 tons soviet spokesman said their 
government had no more than 50000 tons of chemical warfare 
agents 
it may take more than a superpower deal however to provide rid 
the planet of chemical weapons according to two private arms 
control experts in washington 
bushs proposal might focus international attention on 
chemical weapons and lead to a multilateral treaty said lee 
feinstein of the arms control association a disarmament lobby in 
washington 
but it may instead produce a ussoviet agreement and divert 
attention from production by other countries he said 
elisa d harris of the brookings institution in washington 
called bushs call a pretty disappointing response from a 
president who has committed himself to eliminating chemical weapons 
from the face of the earth 
she said it was unlikely to win the support of libyan leader 
moammar gadhafi who us intelligence accuses of trying to build a 
chemical weapons plant gadhafi has said the plant is for 
pharmaceuticals 
we are giving the gadhafis of the world a veto power we are 
saying that we will not implement the treaties until the gadhafis 
agree to it said harris 
other nations thought able to make their own chemical weapons 
are burma china iran iraq israel libya north korea syria 
taiwan and probably egypt she said 
other uncertainties surrounded bushs proposal 
there are questions whether the proposal would require the 
united states to destroy any of the binary weapons that it is now 
producing said feinstein 
in 1987 the united states ended an 18year moratorium on the 
making of chemical weapons but the current and planned level of 
binary production is classified 
bush did not announce an end to production of the new generation 
of binary chemical weapons in which two toxic chemicals mix to 
form a lethal chemical 
since the size of the us stockpile is secret it was not clear 
exactly how many weapons bush was proposing to destroy 
the us government has already started destroying its old 
chemical weapons 
the soviet union suspended chemical weapon production on dec 
26 1987 seven months after the us resumed production and they 
said their stockpile consisted of the nerve agents sarin soman 
vx two mustard blistering agents and one irritant they have said 
they will destroy some chemical weapons but not spelled out how 
many

a man under investigation in the green river 
serial killings will be transferred to federal custody in spokane 
to face charges he possessed a firearm while a fugitive a 
magistrate ordered 
police meanwhile disclosed that william jay stevens ii talked 
for the first time with green river task force which is 
investigating the slayings of up to 48 young women in the northwest 
from 198284 
the interview failed to clear up a number of investigators 
questions said king county police capt robert evans who heads 
the task force 
on monday stevens completed a sentence at the king county jail 
he had been jailed there since his january arrest in spokane for 
escaping from a workrelease facility while serving a term for 
burglary in 1981 
during a hearing monday before us magistrate john l weinberg 
the 38yearold stevens agreed to the transfer to spokane if 
convicted on the firearms count he could be sentenced to 10 years 
in prison and fined 250000 said susan dohrmann assistant us 
attorney 
the green river task force has characterized stevens as a 
viable suspect in its investigation into the deaths of 40 women 
and the disappearances of eight others 
the description was contained in an affidavit filed to support a 
search of two spokane residences where stevens lived while 
attending gonzaga universitys school of law 
no charges related to the killings have been filed against 
stevens who has denied he is the killer 
late last week evans said his officers needed two more weeks to 
finish evaluating their information on stevens 
the decision would be to determine whether this person is a 
murder suspect or merely a victim of some bizarre circumstances 
said evans 
the green river slayings take their name from the south king 
county river where the first victims were discovered

benjamin franklin once implored a young 
tradesman to remember that time is money time in a curious 
way has given a new twist to his advice 
franklin apparently willing to test whether a penny saved is a 
penny earned left bequests to the cities of boston and 
philadelphia 1000 pounds sterling each 
in the nearly 200 years since his death april 17 1790 the 
money has grown in trusts to millions of dollars 
when the 200th anniversary of his death arrives state and city 
officials in accordance with his will will decide what to do 
with the money 
in boston and philadelphia the prospect has started people 
thinking 
rather than just see it go to ben franklin museum we should 
try to be more creative said state sen vincent fumo a 
philadelphia democrat who is shopping around for worthy causes he 
referred to the franklin institute a science museum in 
philadelphia 
i think it should be something symbolic of ben franklin 
fumo added noting that the citys bequest had grown to 2 million 
in a philadelphia trust 
in boston mayor raymond l flynn also is looking for creative 
solutions said his spokesman mike lynch the boston share also 
administered in a trust has grown to about 4 million lynch said 
at the 100th anniversary of franklins death some of the money 
was designated for public works in both cities a request made in 
the will on the 200th anniversary franklin specified that the 
money should be divided between state and city governments with 
about threequarters going to the states and onequarter to the 
cities 
that would give the state of pennsylvania about 15 million and 
philadelphia 500000 massachusetts could receive 3 million and 
boston 1 million 
but its unclear how the money will be used there are ideas 
but no plans have been approved 
fumo said he has been asked to consider using the money for an 
arts fund but wants the state to weigh as many options as 
possible as a starting point he has introduced legislation to 
give the states share to the franklin institute 
in boston officials have been reviewing the issue for about two 
years said robert fleming executive secretary for the citys 
trust office he said a recommendation was expected next year 
franklin asked that the money be used to help young 
artificers meaning craftsmen or inventors and in a way 
thats what its been doing in the hands of the trusts 
in philadelphia much of the money is invested in mortgages in 
boston the bulk of the money has been used for loans to medical 
students 
fleming said there is interest in continuing to use the money 
for student loans 
he really understood the value of thinking for the future 
fleming said of the inventor philosopher and statesman he 
really had a lot of faith in this county he wanted to help those 
who helped him

christina and james kimball scrapped 
their honeymoon dream in puerto rico last week as hurricane hugo 
bore down on the island instead they went to a beachfront 
condominium in south carolina 
the condominium was on the isle of palms off charleston the 
bullseye of hugos first strike on the us mainland 
im just going to remember it as basically a nightmare the 
bride said monday after the couple returned to springfield 
chased from the resort island by evacuation orders the couple 
rode out the storm thursday night in the bathtub of a charleston 
motel they then fled the devastated city driving home nonstop to 
arrive sunday 
the condo 100 feet from the beach was flooded by hugos 
17foot surge the kimballs managed to get to charleston in time to 
escape harm and as the wind picked up huddled in the motel room 
listening as the tar and gravel roof began tearing off 
you couldnt open your door because of the wind pressure 
said mrs kimball then our window smashed open and we ran into 
the bathroom with all our stuff jamie kept running back into the 
room to get everything but we finally sat in the bathtub with a 
candle and the champagne for about an hour 
all you could hear was glass breaking and windows going 
said the bride a package store clerk and community college 
student then the eye of the storm came over about 130 am 
and everyone came out of their rooms 
their car was one of the two left undamaged in the motel parking 
lot 
the kimballs never considered a us landfall for hugo in making 
their plans

residents who got their first look at 
the devastation wrought by hurricane hugo say it will be years 
before this barrier island returns to being a quaint seaside 
village 
on a normal day this was like being in heaven said paul 
traywick whose first floor was buried under an inch of muck 
its not like that any more traywick said not for a long 
time 
the island heavily damaged by wind and water and cut off from 
the mainland because of a downed bridge was declared under martial 
law 
island officials on monday began a daily ferry service allowing 
some residents to return home for a few hours 
hugos 135 mph winds bashed the island located across the 
harbor from charleston and a wall of water swept through homes and 
businesses 
few houses were left undamaged most of the taller trees were 
felled and huge potholes were scooped out of the roads the beach 
has shifted and the entire marina dock was torn loose from its 
pilings and swept to nearby goat island 
it looks like what happens after artillery fire said 
resident tom harper a retired air force officer who served in 
europe during world war ii 
for many residents angry at what they consider government 
inaction in getting them on the island it was a relief to see what 
hugo had wrought 
im glad to know what the situation is said traywick at 
least i know now we can sit down and get started on some plans 
for john bozzelli it wouldnt have made much difference when he 
got to the island his house now split open like an overripe 
melon is about 50 yards from where it was last week 
i pretty well figured it might be gone he said 
the us army corps of engineers began work monday on a 
temporary pontoon bridge linking isle of palms and adjacent 
sullivans island to the mainland isle of palms city councilman 
harry oneal said that should give most residents of the islands 
land access by weeks end 
monday afternoon army barges transported bulldozers to the 
island to clear the fallen trees 
most residents said they would return to rebuild even with the 
firsthand knowledge of what a powerful hurricane can do 
i think most people will be back said muriel metz who owns 
a house and a rental duplex on the island its like an 
addiction the laidback style and the quiet 
al collins manager of the sea cabins development that once 
existed on the beach said the cabins would be rebuilt 
its the tranquillity of the island when its not under a 
storm seige collins said itll be back to that one of these 
days

rebellion aimed at negating the leadership of the communist party 
of china and overthrowing the socialist system 
the june 34 military attack on studentled protesters in 
central beijing was unavoidable he said because of foreign forces 
trying to undermine chinas socialist system and a handful of 
people within china who engaged in all kinds of conspiracies in 
an attempt to overthrow the existing government 
the army killed hundreds of unarmed civilians in the assault 
jiang 63 who reportedly has been named by deng to succeed him 
as top leader when he leaves the political scene said much is at 
stake in the question of when the 85yearold deng should leave 
his last post as chairman of the central military commission 
he noted that deng had on numerous occasions expressed a wish to 
pass on power to a new generation but it was still up to the party 
and state to decide when the architect of chinas past decade of 
economic reforms can step down 
jiang did not mention a party decision revealed in may by zhao 
to continue accepting dengs leadership on major issues regardless 
of his formal resignation from all but the military post 
dengs resignation from that post would not be likely to alter 
his position as the final arbiter of political matters but would 
reflect his efforts to put in place successors he trusts 
jiang acknowledged that the party central committee which could 
make a formal ruling on dengs retirement will be meeting soon to 
map out economic development plans for the next two or three years 
jiang and the others refused to answer repeated questions on the 
number of people arrested and executed in the crackdown on dissent 
qiao shi who is responsible for legal matters within the party 
said we have dealt with some people but all those executed were 
convicted of serious crimes he said china has acted prudently 
toward students and intellectuals and called a foreign report of 
120000 arrests since june unfounded nonsense 
jiang told by a reporter that a woman student had been sent to 
the countryside after participating in the prodemocracy movement 
and been raped there by peasants described the case as a fairy 
tale out of the arabian nights 
he stressed that chinas policy toward students who demanded 
democratic reform was to unite them and educate them 
since taking office jiang has pressed for greater attention to 
ideological matters particularly among young people 
he indicated that in this way he could escape the fate of his 
two predecessors zhao and the late hu yaobang both were purged 
for failing to combat western liberal ideas while trying to open 
china up to the world 
jiang declined to say what will happen to zhao he said the 
party was making further investigations into charges zhao 
supported the prodemocracy movement and thus split the party 
both jiang and li zhaos rival for power blamed zhao for 
letting the political unrest get out of hand but jiangs tone 
indicated zhao may escape criminal charges 
jiang said the party recognized that zhao had done some positive 
things in his nine years as premier and party general secretary 
zhao who has not been seen in public since he went to central 
tiananmen square on may 19 to talk to student hunger strikers is 
leading a quiet and comfortable life jiang said 
jiang added that since zhao had served the party longer than he 
had he enjoys better treatment in fact he enjoys a better 
salary than me 
on other topics vice premier yao yilin who heads the state 
planning commission reiterated that china will stick to such 
economic reforms as developing exportoriented industries along the 
coast 
he said private enterprise would continue to play a necessary 
and beneficial supplemental role in the socialist economy but 
added that appropriate restrictions would check the growth of 
private industry 
premier li spoke at length on corruption a major issue during 
the spring protests saying the party was taking the lead by 
cracking down on nepotism use of luxury imported cars overseas 
trips giftgiving and banqueting at public expense 
jiang like the other five speakers was dressed in a dark 
western suit and tie a former student in the soviet union who also 
speaks good english he used a russian phrase in answering a 
question from a soviet journalist and used english words on several 
occasions

hes got dark legs closely cropped hair and 
is about 4feet8 and at the behest of a group of matchmakers he 
recently flew from san diego to memphis to ease the loss of two 
widowed mares 
hes an asian wild horse otherwise known as przewalskis horse 
and his mission is to be fruitful and multiply especially now that 
his kind are extinct in the wild 
where he goes and with whom he breeds is up to a group of about 
1000 zoologists meeting at a downtown hotel this week to determine 
the fate of more than 7000 animals from 50 endangered species kept 
in north american zoos and aquariums 
what happens then is up to mother nature 
we recognize that we can make a genetic plan but were 
dealing with individual animals and they dont always read the 
books we do but so far hes showing the right interests oliver 
ryder of the san diego zoo said monday 
ryder oversees the captive breeding of przewalskis horses 
through the american association of zoological parks and aquariums 
an umbrella organization of 140 institutions in north america 
the organization is trying to rescue animals from extinction by 
breeding them in captivity with the hopes of eventually 
reintroducing them to the wild 
zoos cant hope to save everything they can only hope to save 
a small portion of the species of the world said dennis meritt 
jr a board member of the association and assistant director of 
the lincoln park zoo in chicago 
its better than not having anything said jack grisham of 
the oklahoma city zoo who oversees the nationwide breeding of 
cheetahs 
remember the bison back at the turn of the century there was 
just a handful and the new york zoological society took them to the 
wichita mountains in oklahoma and they started breeding again 
theyre the basis of all the bison in north america grisham said 
but problems remain 
any place in the world today theres a problem with finding 
space for wild animals said ryder whether they continue to 
exist is completely up to one species us its our decision 
whether we make the space and provide them with protection to 
survive its up to us do nothing and theyre gone 
the association counts several successes among its special 
survival plans 
only about 50 bali mynah birds remain in the wild but american 
zoos have been so successful in breeding them that several hundred 
are expected to be released into the rain forests of bali in coming 
years meritt said 
there are no known freeranging arabian oryx a type of antelope 
once found on the arabian peninsula but thanks to captive 
breeding the oryx is being returned to the desert meritt said 
tom foose association coordinator of the species survival plans 
for all the zoos said zookeepers want to spread animal genes 
around different zoos to avoid sterility mutations and other 
problems in breeding 
our objective is to stop evolution and preserve as much as the 
gene pool as we can get these animals back in the wild and let 
natural selection sort it all out again foose said

congressional investigators say that almost a 
year after a pan am jet exploded over scotland the federal 
aviation administration cant say that its promised tighter 
security precautions are in place 
airlines are not meeting their security requirements and the 
training of security workers appears to be the biggest problem 
according to a general accounting office report that was summarized 
monday by a congresswoman 
faa has not established minimum training standards needed to 
ensure that airline security personnel working at high risk 
airports overseas are sufficiently trained to carry out required 
security measures rep cardiss collins dill quoted gao the 
investigative arm of congress as saying 
collins said the full report would remain secret but she said 
investigators found the faa cannot assure itself that required 
security procedures are being properly carried out by the airlines 
at designated highrisk airports 
airlines are responsible for security at airport gates 
generally using guidelines set by the faa 
the airports considered highrisk for americans were identified 
during the hearing as those in europe and the middle east 
two hundred seventy people died when pan am flight 103 which 
started in frankfurt west germany and stopped in london blew up 
over lockerbie scotland last dec 21 investigators found the 
midair explosion was caused by a bomb in a radio cassette player 
the syrianbacked popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command is considered the prime suspect behind 
the act though the groups leader has denied involvement 
witnesses told the hearing of the house government operations 
government activities and transportation subcommittee which 
collins chairs that intelligence about antiamerican groups likely 
to attack airlines isnt good enough 
security begins with an understanding of the threat it faces 
our intelligence services must provide this understanding said 
noel koch former defense department expert on terrorism now 
president of international security management inc 
they dont do it especially well and it isnt especially easy 
to do he said the faa should have an independent intelligence 
capability 
edward cunningham managing director of corporate security of 
pan american world airways inc said the government should take 
more responsibility for combatting travel dangers and should share 
some intelligence with airlines 
information like the types of passports these groups are 
using cunningham said when information is floating around 
that a group is planning something we should be told 
pan am was fined recently for alleged security lapses at 
heathrow airport and frankforts airport including failure to 
properly screen passengers improperly checking some carryon 
baggage and failure to search cargo areas before loading 
about a dozen members of two organizations of family members of 
passengers on flight 103 also told the congressional panel the 
government should get tougher on security 
placing responsibility for security procedures in the hands of 
airlines is a conflict of interest said testimony prepared by 
the victims of pan am flight 103 airlines are in the business to 
make money precious dollars are cut from vital security budgets to 
raise bottomline profits

benjamin ward the citys first black police 
commissioner has resigned after almost six years leaving a legacy 
of innovation despite budget constraints a tough war on drugs and 
his own verbal gaffes 
im not always right ward once said but im never dull 
ward 63 cited chronic asthma in a resignation letter sent 
monday to mayor edward i koch his departure is effective oct 22 
during wards time in office crime rates soared and city 
streets got more violent fueled by crack 
ward said combating the drug war was his highest priority from 
the start noting that the narcotics division grew almost 
fivefold during his term which began jan 1 1984 he also 
created tactical narcotics teams that are deployed to crackridden 
neighborhoods 
but ward added in his letter i must acknowledge that the 
greatest problem when i came in is even more serious as i depart 
the plague of illegal drugs that has wreaked such tragedy 
violence and crime 
koch who called ward one of the greatest police commissioners 
that ever served appointed first deputy commissioner richard j 
condon wards own choice as commissioner 
koch who lost his bid for reelection in septembers democratic 
primary to manhattan borough president david dinkins leaves office 
at the end of the year 
koch said ward indicated before the primary that he wanted to 
resign but waited at the mayors request he said ward would return 
to private life but would not elaborate 
ward has been working since june on his memoirs tentatively 
titled cop to be published next fall 
ward ran afoul of some black groups in july 1987 when he called 
black crime against blacks our little dirty secret 
the next month he apologized publicly for saying to a woman who 
spoke at a town meeting about being afraid of rapists youre out 
here tonight you cant be too frightened youre the kind hes 
looking for under 30 beautiful blonde 
in apologizing for what he called that insensitive remark 
ward said the woman had been heckling him and that he had taken 
asthma medication that may hype me up 
ward joined the force in 1951 as the first black police officer 
in a brooklyn precinct 
i think they were surprised to see me he recalled in 1984 
i had an irish name and i came from a predominantly white 
veterans housing project in bath beach but when they saw me they 
developed a sudden shortage of lockers at the precinct house 
by the time he was through the positions he held included 
detective head of the internal legal department commissioner for 
community affairs city traffic commissioner state correction 
commissioner chief of the city housing police and city correction 
commissioner 
the commissioner oversaw a department with 26790 officers in 
resigning he noted that it had grown by 2129 officers during his 
tenure and that the number of black officers rose 17 percent 
hispanics 60 percent and women 85 percent 
the uniformed force now is 11 percent black 115 percent 
hispanic and 124 percent female he said 
ward also cited increased educational requirements for certain 
ranks a stronger stand on domestic violence and a program to 
put officers back on foot patrol in all 75 precincts

twentythousand teachers were returning to 
classes today following a oneday walkout but pledged to maintain 
pressure for greater funding for a crowded school system that ranks 
last in perpupil expenditures 
we will keep the pressure on said utah education 
association president jim campbell 
the walkout gave 435000 children an unexpected holiday when all 
but two of utahs 40 school districts were closed down monday 
the strike was incited by the legislatures decision during a 
special session last week to give residents a 384 million tax 
rebate and not to allocate money to education from a 94 million 
surplus 
the walkout began with a wildcat strike friday morning at davis 
high school in davis county just north of salt lake city and 
spread to schools in three other large school districts by the end 
of the day 
republican gov norm bangerter and the republicancontrolled 
legislature who drew the wrath of teachers as they previously drew 
the ire of taxpayers for a record tax hike two years ago pledged 
money would be found for education during the regular legislative 
session which begins in january 
with a population of 17 million utah has the largest average 
household size at 317 compared with the national average of 262 
nearly 70 percent of its residents are members of the mormon 
church which encourages large families and the state has the 
nations highest percentage of schoolage children with 37 percent 
under 18 
with a studentteacher ratio of 254 to 1 utah also has the 
most overcrowded classrooms and at 22621 a year its teachers 
earn smaller salaries than educators in 43 other states according 
to the union the state ranks 50th in the average annual 
expenditure per student of 2326 according to the union 
years of budget cuts have produced increasing complaints about 
outdated textbooks and inadequate supplies with many teachers 
saying theyve had to pay hundreds of dollars out of their own 
pockets to provide basic supplies 
weve had truck drivers steelworkers housewives retired 
workers and parents calling to say its about time said 
campbell whose organization represents up to 90 percent of the 
states teachers 
bob chase vice president of the national education association 
assured more than 3000 teachers gathered at liberty park on monday 
that they had the support of some 2 million teachers for their 
courageous act of conscience 
bangerter defended the tax cut 
you have to remember i was the one who raised taxes two years 
ago he said 
that record tax hike sparked taxslashing initiatives that were 
defeated by nearly a 2to1 margin in novembers election but the 
governor and legislative leaders decided to cut taxes when an 
economic resurgence brought the budget surplus 
the governor has said teachers should have waited until the 
regular legislative session to press their demands but he 
acknowledged the walkout got attention 
there is a perception out there that all of the money has been 
given back it hasnt bangerter said after the tax cut that 
was passed by the legislature we still have a 55 million surplus 
this year and 100 million from the last two years 
he said education would be treated honorably and honestly in 
january

most papers in the storms path through south carolina managed 
to keep printing but it wasnt easy 
in columbia the state newspaper temporarily housed two other 
papers the staff of the charleston papers didnt go home for 
several nights in myrtle beach the sun news staff used portable 
toilets because the city sewers were out of commission 
we got the paper out friday and have been doing it ever 
since said bob hawkins an editor at the news and courier and 
the evening post in hardhit charleston 
a couple of nights everyone slept on the floor at the 
newspaper hawkins said we didnt smell too good 
the newspapers emergency generator provided enough electricity 
to run the printing press computers and a few lights but the 
staff was still without running water monday 
hugo struck south carolina late thursday killing at least 17 
people and leaving more than 3 billion in damage 
some papers were able to gather and print the information their

in an electoral battle between the 
ruling sandinistas and their ussupported opponents the 
sandinistas showed superior organization at a convention replete 
with balloons whistles and bells 
a gathering of 1746 delegates nominated president daniel ortega 
on sunday as the candidate of the leftist sandinista national 
liberation front for what may become the most hotly contested 
election in nicaraguan history on feb 25 
the sandinistas have an apparent victory under their belts in a 
long war against contra rebels 
opposition assets include an economy in disarray and a 
wellknown candidate violeta barrios de chamorro widow of a hero 
of the revolution that toppled dictator anastasio somoza in 1979 
but the opposition is also a shaky coalition of 14 parties that 
range from communist to conservative their bitter closeddoor 
nomination meeting contrasted sharply with the lively sandinista 
convention 
ortega promised fair elections in return for a central american 
agreement to disband the ussupported contras by early december 
while that date might not be met it appears that the end of the 
war is in sight 
the war against the sandinista government is paralyzed because 
of the peace accords said wycliff diego leader of a major 
indian resistance group from eastern nicaragua 
diego became the latest leader to drop out of the armed 
resistance when he said monday that he would return to nicaragua 
this week to investigate setting up a political party and 
supporting mrs chamorro 
but while the electoral process seems to be drawing in the 
opposition and weakening the armed resistance the sandinista 
platform slogan everything will be better exposed a crack in 
an otherwise slick surface 
the slogan is a reminder if any were needed that nicaraguas 
economy has gone steadily downhill to the point that it rivals 
haiti as the poorest nation in the americas 
in an effort to control hyperinflation the government has had 
to implement an austerity program that left thousands jobless 
the sandinistas blame their problems on the war and a us 
economic boycott but promises of better times ahead are being met 
with skepticism by voters who must struggle daily to make ends meet 
with less money higher prices and food shortages 
it was no surprise that ortega and vice president sergio ramirez 
were renominated they have worked together smoothly in the past 
ortega is the tough firebrand exguerrilla who doesnt miss a 
chance to bait the us government while ramirez is the cool 
moderatetoned polished intellectual 
in his acceptance speech ortega predicted the sandinista would 
win and that the united states will have to accept an 
understanding with nicaragua 
the bush administration has already given signs of 
accommodation recently a top state department official visited 
nicaragua and met with ortega the first time that has happened in 
years 
ortega knows that winning us acceptance however reluctant is 
probably vital to economic recovery but also that this depends on 
his party winning the elections cleanly 
the sandinistas are intent on having the vote declared free and 
fair and have invited international observers including former 
president jimmy carter who monitored panamas presidential 
election in may and called it a fraud 
in an editorial mrs chamorros newspaper la prensa said 
ortegas speech showed the sandinistas were depending on sterile 
antiamericanism and did not have a vision of the future to sell 
the electorate 
the bush administration is trying to devise a way to assist 
nicaraguas fledgling democratic process without providing direct 
support to the opposition 
a figure of 9 million has been mentioned by us congressional 
sources that would be more than 4 for each of nicaraguas 19 
million voters but there are no signs of any big money yet 
the sandinistas has already called on its organizations which 
cover every neighborhood in the country to begin housetohouse 
campaigning using the threat of a superfinanced opposition for 
motivation 
the wellplanned sandinista convention to which the press and 
the diplomatic corps were invited contrasted sharply with tense 
deliberations of the political parties comprising the national 
opposition union 
the uno as it is known for its spanish initials chose virgilio 
godoy as mrs chamorros running mate three weeks ago but the 
choice almost split the coalition 
the choice was considered important because many view mrs 
chamorro as a figurehead conservatives supported businessman 
enrique bolanos but godoys supporters said bolanos would tilt the 
ticket too far to the right

wally floody the captured fighter pilot who 
engineered the tunnel through which 76 allied officers fled from a 
nazi prison in a story portrayed in the film the great escape has 
died at age 71 
floody died in a hospital monday after a lengthy illness 
he had chronic lung disease partially due to the tunneling he 
did during the war said his son brian it only got severe 
during the past several years 
a royal canadian air force officer floody used the mining 
experience he gained in kirkland lake ont to engineer and dig 
the 350foot tunnel out of stalag luft iii 
of the 76 allied officers who fled the camp on march 24 1944 
only three eventually made good their escape at least 50 of those 
recaptured six of them canadian were executed 
floody was moved to another camp just before the escape 
every time i tell my wife i might have been one of the 
prisoners who got away she reminds me yes but you might have 
been one of the ones they shot he said in a 1986 interview 
the mass breakout was the subject of the 1963 movie the great 
escape starring steve mcqueen james garner and charles bronson 
floody was a technical advisor for the film 
floody was 23 when his spitfire was shot down over france in 
1941 he often served as the lead digger and passed buckets of the 
sandy gravel back to a brigade of men working in the tunnels which 
were named tom dick and harry 
the gravel was hidden in the camps gardens 
floody became trapped several times in caveins and had to be 
pulled out by his heels 
the germans eventually discovered tom dick was abandoned and 
harry became the escape route 
about 600 of the 1500 officers in the camp helped dig the 
tunnels but it was floody who designed the lighting ventilation 
and electrical systems 
wally was living canadian history clem pearce another 
canadian flyer who spent time in stalag iii said monday 
he always kept on fighting and other men took inspiration 
from that whenever veterans got together wally was a center of 
attention because of his fame as the tunnel king pearce said 
floody remained in prison camps until the war ended the 
chatham ont native returned to canada and began his business 
career in toronto he also helped found the rcaf prisonerofwar 
association 
he is survived by his wife elizabeth and sons brian and 
michael

ten years ago linh trang was one of the 
first vietnamese soldiers to enter cambodia in a surprise invasion 
that toppled the khmer rouge government in phnom penh 
it was hell in cambodia 10 years of it said trang 33 who 
commanded a battallion in the guerrillainfested jungles of western 
cambodia im just glad to be going home 
this morning those 10 years in hell ended as trang and 10000 
other troops marched home through the gates of this sleepy border 
town 
up and down the border vietnamese troops are coming home in 
what the hanoi government says is the withdrawal of its last 26000 
troops in cambodia 
returning by ship ferry truck and on foot the soldiers faced 
a governmentorchestrated heros welcome today but an uncertain 
future 
like many of his comrades trang was stricken by malaria during 
the war he also said hes lost 15 pounds which means a lot to his 
small frame 
but he said none of his health problems concern him what is 
important now is to find a job 
last week the chief spokesman of the vietnamese defense 
ministry said vietnam would demobilize an unspecificied number of 
solidiers after its war with cambodia 
major gen nguyen van thai said returning veterans would be 
given preference in finding work and economic assistance if they 
had difficulties 
but many wonder whether vietnam which is one of the poorest 
countries in asia and already faces an unemployment crisis will be 
able to provide jobs for the returning soldiers 
i am not a young man said trang so i dont think i can 
return to school i want to work in textiles maybe as a tailor 
before i entered the army i was a tailor in ho chi minh city 
still he said nothing had been settled 
luon van dang is a little more sure about what he wants to do 
but just as worried 
the 23yearold from can tho province says he will try to stay 
in the armed forces his home for the last five years 
i like a soldiers life he said as he squatted in the 
buffer zone between cambodia and vietnam i lost my family during 
the vietnam war so the army is my family they feed me and clothe 
me i believe in them 
dang said he hoped he would not be demobilized 
my officers know i love the vietnamese army he said but 
after i walk through the gate to my country over there everything 
could change 
hanoi has demobilized more than a halfmillion soldiers in 
recent years gen tran cong man editor of vietnams official army 
newspaper said in a recent interview with the associated press 
he said the armed forces manpower peak was 15 million in 1979 
50000 were demobilized between 1982 and 1987 and over the past 
two years hanoi had released 500000 
some soldiers said they will miss cambodia 
earlier last week at a goodbye ceremony at pursat a 
provincial cambodian capital cao viet sat weeping in the corner as 
he hugged a cambodian brotherinarms 
we are very close to the people in the countryside said the 
vietnamese officer who spent six years in cambodia and speaks good 
khmer we died for these people and they know it i will never 
forget the people here 
behind him a cambodian cultural troupe played salsa music 
vietnamese soldiers danced with cambodian women bottles of western 
scotch were passed from hand to hand 
fighting in the jungles was difficult viet said lack of 
transportation makes for shortages of drinking water and food many 
nights he and his men went hungry he said 
a guerrilla enemy is very hard to destroy viet said they 
would attack and then disperse and chasing them with difficult 
the vietnamese army began as a guerrilla force when it battled 
the french and american armies but it used more traditional methods 
in fighting its war in cambodia viet said he saw no irony in this 
we were the liberators of cambodia he said we did what 
we had to do

inmates to prepare them for the real world

not going to teach people how to sue collins said but we will 
do articles on things like the services provided for inmates by the 
inmate attorney

cambodian resistance groups claim 
tens of thousands of vietnamese troops have disguised themselves as 
cambodians and will remain in the country despite hanois claims of 
a total troop withdrawal 
the resistance charge is emerging as its central argument to 
justify an escalation of the war in cambodia despite the absence 
of any hard evidence of a largescale plan by the vietnamese army 
to remain in cambodia 
vietnam said the last of its forces will be out of cambodia 
which it invaded in late 1978 by midnight today but officials of 
all three major resistance groups characterize the pullout as an 
elaborate hoax 
the vietnamese will not withdraw from cambodia said prince 
norodom rannaridth in a recent interview we are not fighting a 
civil war it will remain a war to liberate cambodia from 
vietnamese occupation 
the prince leads the army loyal to his father prince norodom 
sihanouk who heads a loose coalition which also includes the khmer 
rouge and the noncommunist khmer peoples national liberation 
front 
the sihanoukists charge that more than 30000 vietnamese have 
already been disguised as troops or militia of the phnom penh 
government or as vietnamese civilians living in the country others 
are operating in remote areas as regular vietnamese troops they 
claim 
khmer rouge radio claimed in a recent broadcast that the number 
of disguised vietnamese troops is 110000 
while the resistance and defectors fleeing to the thaicambodian 
border often cite specific units and figures where the subterfuge 
is supposedly occurring western analysts following developments in 
cambodia are still uncertain 
i have heard many reports of vietnamese disguised as phnom 
penh troops but we cannot confirm anything one analyst said 
i am not saying it isnt happening but we have no proof 
all they the resistance need is one piece of hard evidence 
one captured document or officer said another cambodia watcher 
but until then nobody will believe them nobody except 
cambodians who are always ready to believe in the worst intentions 
of the vietnamese 
cambodia experts point out that a total vietnamese pullout would 
greatly undermine the resistance battle cry that they are fighting 
their historic enemies the vietnamese and preventing them from 
swallowing the country 
but should there be truth in the resistance claims vietnam 
would jeopardize its sorely needed economic assistance from 
noncommunist nations which have shunned it since the invasion 
hanoi hopes the withdrawal will end its isolation 
the resistance groups say disguised vietnamese units are used 
only to support government troops who are faring poorly in combat 
against their fighters 
the vietnamese are in cambodian prime minister hun sen 
uniforms i have seen many of them said 25yearold mao souen a 
defector from the phnom penh army in my unit there were six 
vietnamese experts they are in hun sen uniforms like me before 
they were in vietnamese uniforms but three months ago they 
switched 
the chief military analyst of the khmer peoples national 
liberation front dr abdul gaffar said a number of disguised 
vietnamese were fighting in pailin khmer rouge and phnom penh 
troops are reportedly locked in fierce battle for the gemrich 
thaicambodian border town 
gaffar said two regiments of hanois 330th division had been 
integrated into phnom penhs 92nd division while three other 
vietnamese regiments had shed their own uniforms 
the resistance also points to vietnamese civilians living in 
cambodia as proof of hanois intention to colonize their country 
it places the number of these settlers at 125 million vietnamese 
officials say there are only 80000 while some western diplomats 
estimate 200000 
most are shopkeepers skilled workers and fishermen many have 
left or are leaving fearing for their safety after the vietnamese 
military shield is withdrawn

the liberal party governing quebec retained its 
majority over a steady challenge from the separatist parti 
quebecois and a surprising protest vote from the provinces 
englishspeaking minority 
results of mondays vote in the largest and second most populous 
canadian province showed the liberals led by premier robert 
bourassa with 92 seats in the 125seat provincial assembly 
the parti quebecois won 29 seats a gain of six and a new 
equality party captured four in traditional liberal strongholds 
i believe that this is a sign of confidence a smiling 
bourassa whose early hopes for a calm campaign capitalizing on 
four years of continuing prosperity in canadas largest province 
had been dashed by environmental protests and labor unrest said at 
his district headquarters 
the parti quebecois had been reeling from its provincial 
election debacle four years ago in which it lost power to bourassa 
and fell to only 23 of the then122 seat assembly 
jacques parizeau who won an internal party battle to put it 
back on a hardline course last year ran a strong campaign on a 
platform of eventual independence for the majority frenchspeaking 
province 
we have progressed solidly toward the goal that we think is 
the right one parizeau said monday night in reiterating his 
separatist aims supporters chanted le quebec aux quebecois or 
quebec for quebecers 
the equality party was formed by english speakers irate over 
quebecs language policies that still restrict all outdoor signs to 
french supporters at party headquarters sang o canada the 
national anthem at their victory celebration 
i have never been so proud to be a canadian and a quebecois in 
my life said robert libman 29yearold architect who formed the 
equality party just months ago 
bourassa an economist counted on quebecers being more 
interested in pragmatic issues related to prosperity than to 
independence he pointed to a 4 percent annual economic growth 
rate the creation of 233000 new jobs and the social stability 
that lasted most of his term 
but the idea of separatism for quebec thought to have been put 
to rest in a 1980 referendum in which 60 percent of the voters 
rebuffed it held on to its current of support 
the parti quebecois won 387 percent of the popular vote in the 
december 1985 provincial election projections were that it had 
increased slightly to 40 percent monday 
bourassas support among quebecs englishspeaking minority 
which traditionally had voted liberal was hurt by his refusal in 
december to allow more than a token change in provincial laws 
restricting commercial signs to the french language 
his compromise solution allowed bilingual signs only indoors as 
long as the frenchlanguage portion was significantly larger than 
the english 
quebec which has a population of 65 million is 81 percent 
frenchspeaking 
supporters of language restrictions argue they are necessary to 
protect french and quebecs special culture surrounded by english 
elsewhere in north america those who oppose the restrictions say 
they violate basic rights 
bourassas term before the language uproar last winter was 
unusually quiet as quebec settled into a period of strong economic 
growth leading to speculation that the parti quebecois could be 
facing its last days 
the separatist party had controlled the provincial government 
from 1976 at the height of the period when power in quebec shifted 
from the englishspeaking minority to the french majority to their 
defeat in 1985 
mondays victory confirmed the comeback by bourassa whose 
colorless style could almost be considered a trademark 
he was the youngest premier ever elected in quebec when he won 
the 1970 election at the age of 36 but the parti quebecois then 
ousted him six years later at the height of separatist sentiment

the office of a newspaper that has been 
criticized for running photographs of a man electrocuted in an 
accident was rammed by a bus spraypainted with messages demanding 
respect for the dead man 
police questioned a man whose wallet was found under the bus 
that crashed into the lobby of the mesa tribune early monday the 
man whose surname is the same as the dead mans refused to 
cooperate said police spokesman mike hayes 
no one was injured in the incident 
the tribune printed two color photos last week with a brief 
story on the death of mark tracy 25 who was killed sept 18 when 
he touched a power line while trimming a palm tree 
the newspaper ran one photo showing tracys legs as paramedics 
lowered him from the tree the other photo showed a relative 
leaning against an ambulance hyperventilating after seeing tracy 
die 
tracys friends and relatives flooded the paper with angry calls 
and letters about the photos 
an anonymous caller to phoenix television station ktsp claimed 
responsibility for ramming the building because the newspaper 
disgraced tracy said mary morse a morning producer 
the wallet found at the scene led police to lloyd ray tracy 33 
hayes said officers also found a bill of sale for the bus made out 
to tracy though it was still registered to another man hayes said 
police were unsure of the relationship between lloyd tracy and 
the dead man hayes said 
the 1956 school bus was spraypainted with we love you mark 
rest in peace and we demand respect for mark tracy 
tribune publisher michael laosa said the decision to publish the

on a daily basis 
laosa added they think it and rethink it and make a decision 
to run or not run it we will continue to make those kinds of 
judgments as the situations present themselves i wish there was an 
easy answer

the satanic verses is one novel that shook 
the world but one year and 11 million hardback copies after it 
was released the factors publishers weigh in deciding what to 
print remain the same experts say 
the book was one of a kind i mean it was a fictional fantasy 
that happened to affect large numbers of people and particularly 
people in positions of power and i think thats a very unlikely 
thing to be repeated right now said john baker editorinchief 
of publishers weekly a trade magazine 
viking penguin inc published the book a year ago 
five months later on feb 14 irans ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini fixed the worlds attention on it when he put a 52 
million bounty on the life of its moslem author salman rushdie 
khomeini also urged moslems to kill his publishers 
the book which most moslem countries banned because they said 
it blasphemed islam plunged iran into a confrontation with the 
west 
viking penguin says its decision to publish the book was not 
influenced by its potentially inflamatory content 
we certainly didnt buy the satanic verses because we 
thought it would be controversial we bought it because we think 
salman rushdie is one of the most distinguished authors of the late 
20th century said paul slovak a spokesman at the publishing 
house 
slovak declined monday to disclose sales or profit figures for 
the book but he added that despite the huge sales viking penguin 
may just about break even because of costly security measures it 
was forced to take 
we cant let our guard down completely even now he said 
on sunday a london newspaper reported that a paperback edition 
of the book would come out this winter but that the exact date was 
being kept secret for security reasons earlier there were reports 
that plans for a paperback edition had been shelved for fear of 
more violence 
the books hardback release in england on sept 22 1988 led to 
a series of bookstore bombings and other troubles including the 
refusal of some stores to stock it out of fear for their safety 
the satanic verses first appeared in us stores in january 
though it wasnt officially released in this country until feb 22 
david rubin a new york university journalism professor said 
the determining factor among book publishers in deciding what books 
to offer is profitability not whether it will be controversial 
the notion of publishing a book because it is critical of 
government or some group palestinians moslems or jews and 
banking on that and the publicity that may come from it is much too 
speculative a strategy for people who are basically kind of 
accountants rubin said 
and barbara reno a spokeswoman for simon amp schuster said 
people assume a lot of the time publishers arent publishing a 
book because theyre worried about controversy in fact theyre 
making business decisions 
jeffrey robinson who wrote a bestselling controversial 
biography of former saudi arabian oil minister ahmed zaki yamani 
published in england said profit motivated viking penguin to print 
more copies of the satanic verses when demand skyrocketed 
thats just fueling the fires said robinsoni think most 
publishers would be very wary of getting involved with a book like 
that again 
but there will always be somebody 
morgan entrekin an independent publisher under the umbrella of 
atlantic monthly press said it gets very dangerous if you let 
yourself get censored a priori i dont go looking for trouble but 
i try not to let it influence me too much 
charles hayward president of simon amp schusters trade division 
said controversy should not factor into a books rejection 
i dont think you can be selective youve got to publish 
books that deserve to be published otherwise thats where the 
selfcensorship would begin and where would it end 
satanic verses was such an extreme theres no way to 
anticipate that type of outrageous reaction 
but he admitted we sometimes buy controversial books to 
generate news

a physician free after two years in jail for 
refusing to let her daughter visit her former husband says she 
realizes she could wind up back behind bars in her bitter child 
custody battle 
i dont know that anything is over dr elizabeth morgan 
said shortly after she was released monday from the district of 
columbia jail i could be jailed again and i know that and my 
daughter remains unprotected 
morgan 41 was jailed on civil contempt of court charges in 
august 1987 after failing to produce her 7yearold daughter hilary 
for courtordered visits with dr eric foretich her exhusband and 
the girls father she has alleged that foretich sexually abused 
hilary foretich has repeatedly denied those charges 
her release was the result of a law passed by congress and 
signed by president bush last week limiting civil contempt jail 
terms in the district of columbia to 12 months the law expires 
after 18 months 
sen orrin hatch rutah who sponsored the bill which resulted 
in her release said today that morgan still could be charged with 
criminal contempt so i suspect this case is not over he said 
on abcs good morning america program 
foretich appearing on the same program said im delighted 
that elizabeth morgan is out of jail i only wish this could be 
coupled with some concern for my missing daughter i would have 
been in support of that bill if the bill had a provision mandating 
a government agency such as the fbi be required to find my 
daughter 
while morgan smiled during a news conference and held hands with 
her fiance federal appeals court judge paul r michel she 
acknowledged that her legal fight is far from over 
i intend to stay here and work through the legal system until 
hilary is safe morgan said i will never give up 
i cannot say where she is if there is a possibility she would 
be returned to foretich she said 
elaine mittleman foretichs attorney said after morgan was 
released that further proceedings against her are quite likely 
morgan remains in contempt of court and this law doesnt 
change that ms mittleman said thats not being vengeful 
its just what the law is about 
foretichs attorney maintained in court papers that the new law 
was unconstitutional because it infringed on the power of the 
judicial branch to enforce its orders 
ms mittleman also charged in her papers that the law violated 
several of foretichs constitutional rights among them the right 
to due process of law 
district superior court judge geoffrey alprin signed the order 
freeing morgan 
a cold driving rain greeted her as she emerged from the jail 
riding in a car accompanied by michel and her attorney stephen 
sachs 
i feel very happy and very grateful to everyone that has 
helped me she said wearing an orange prison jumpsuit and 
clutching a dozen yellow roses given her by michel i will 
probably cry when i say this but i want to thank god for every 
angel on earth who has helped me 
meeting reporters later after changing into a blue dress with 
white polka dots morgan said she was stunned its a bit like 
being born again 
refusing to disclose hilarys whereabouts she said her daughter 
is better off than she was when morgan started the jail term 
shes happy where she is morgan said shes made a 
remarkable recovery she obviously misses me as i miss her but 
she has no desire to return if it means further incest 
asked whether she had heard from her daughter during her two 
years behind bars morgan responded yes but i wont tell you 
how and added if i were going to my daughter i would not tell 
you 
morgan was asked what the future holds and replied i hope it 
doesnt hold jail she said she was going wherever my fiance 
will take me 
morgan was asked what she would say if she could talk to her 
daughter 
she paused then said youre a wonderful girl and it was 
worth every minute i hope the last two years were just the 
beginning of a lifetime of safety

the fire that killed two people and 
injured dozens aboard a huge north sea passenger ferry apparently 
was deliberately set police said today 
the 600foot tor scandinavia was traveling from goteborg 
sweden to harwich england with 650 passengers and crew when the 
fire broke out at dawn monday 
the fire was put out within a few hours and the danish ferry 
owned by the shipping company scandinavian seaways sailed under 
its own power to its home port esbjerg 
esbjerg police inspector herluf mogensen head of the 
investigation said the fire started in a hall with linen closets 
close to a staircase on a passenger deck in the bow the staircase 
leads up to the radio room mogensen said electric failure had been 
excluded as a cause of the blaze 
theoretically a cigarette could have been accidentally dropped 
in one of the 10 trolleys standing in the hall with linen but the 
violent development of the fire indicates it was helped and that it 
was deliberately set mogensen told the associated press 
he said a crew member carried out a routine inspection 40 
minutes before the fire started and found everything was normal 
mogensen declined to say if there were any suspects 
a middleaged swedish couple was found dead in a cabin close to 
where the fire started 
mogensen said 35 persons suffering from smoke inhalation were 
treated in hospital shipping company officials said monday that 10 
were injured danish radio reported monday night that about 50 were 
taken to hospital when the ferry reached esbjerg the reason for 
the discrepancies was not immediately explained

experiments at the university of utahs 
new national cold fusion institute have shown no sign of producing 
fusion says the director of the research center 
we have a conference coming up here next february said 
director hugo rossi if we dont have any papers to present then 
this place will be closing up shop im not saying i will do that 
im just saying i think that is what would happen 
the center was set up by the state after chemists b stanley 
pons and martin fleischmann announced at the university in march 
that they had harnessed the energy source that powers the sun by 
achieving fusion at room temperature in a jar 
rossi said monday the institutes more than 20 electrochemical 
cells all variations of pons and fleischmanns experiment have 
produced no excess heat and no fusion products such as neutrons or 
tritium 
its gotten to be time for us to start wondering if were 
doing anything wrong said rossi he called the situation 
unnerving 
scientists around the world have had difficulty duplicating pons 
and fleischmanns experiments which held out the possibility of a 
cheap relatively safe and virtually inexhaustible supply of energy 
conventional nuclear energy or fission splits atoms fusion 
produces energy by fusing them together 
rossi said the institute is negotiating with the electric power 
research institute in menlo park calif for funding the 
institute so far has only 43 million in state money to spend on 
research neither rossi nor fritz kulhammer epri vice president 
for exploratory research would say how much money is involved 
in another development a scientist from the european laboratory 
cern said that a worldwide examination of attempts to duplicate 
cold fusion shows there is little hope that it is real 
douglas morrison a selfdescribed student of pathological 
science said that in most cases the experimenters found no 
effect or found something early on but couldnt repeat it 
morrison a physicist at the european organization for nuclear 
research in geneva was in utah last week to visit with university 
of utah scientists pons and fleischmann were in japan and are not 
expected to return until thursday 
morrison said cold fusion fits the mold of other wrong 
experiments in scientific history that appeared to hold huge 
promise 
it is normal when you have a wonderful dream to accept the 
positive and suppress the negative he said everyone does it 
scientists are human too 
rossi said morrison gave his talk as if the book has been 
closed and i think its premature

the supreme soviet today began a stormy debate on 
the future of small private businesses that president mikhail 
gorbachev says are facing an ultimatum from soviet consumers upset 
about price gouging 
gorbachev questioned why soap for example is sold by the 
businesses for as much as 9 when it should sell for 150 or less 
we have to take into account the mood of the people he told 
the legislature as it began debating proposed amendments that would 
decentralize control of private firms and give local governments 
more power to regulate them 
the amendments were to be submitted to a legislative committee 
but both opponents and supporters of the private businesses called 
cooperatives used the joint session to debate the enterprises 
future 
the debate came a day after the soviet government presented a 
crisis budget including a reduction in defense spending by more 
than 8 percent and measures to cut the budget deficit in half 
gorbachev initiated legislation that beginning in 1987 allowed 
individuals to set up small cooperative businesses to provide goods 
and services the governmentrun economy could not 
he said he stands by cooperatives for the innovation and 
competition they can bring to the soviet economy but that price 
gouging and corruption must be controlled because of public outrage 
several groups including trade union activists and a group of 
farmers who met with gorbachev last weekend are demanding a 
crackdown on cooperatives which charge prices that are not 
regulated by the state 
deputy veniamin yarin of nizhni tagilsk said that cooperatives 
engage in open robbery of the working man 
but deputy anatoly sobchak head of the law school at leningrad 
state university said cooperatives in some areas were facing 
wholesale closure by local governments that were ignoring the law 
deputy premier leonid abalkin one of gorbachevs closest 
economic advisers presented the amendments and told the deputies 
that cooperatives are making the first step toward forming a 
socialist market which we have been talking about for so long 
abalkin said problems that cause public outrage with 
cooperatives actually are the problems of the entire soviet 
economy such as severe shortages of basic goods and services 
he said soviet society must recognize that cooperatives are an 
important part of the economy agree to treat them equally with 
staterun business and allow local governments to regulate them in 
order to take into account local needs and viewpoints 
finance minister valentin pavlov who presented the 1990 budget 
proposal on monday described the countrys economic problems as a 
crisis the supreme soviets twomonth session will consider 
about 80 bills aimed at altering some longtime tenets of soviet 
politics 
with a need to generate more revenues and cut expenses the 
kremlin plans to implement a progressive income tax for soviets 
earning 1076 a month more than three times the average workers 
wage and float a 92 billion bond issue the nations first 
domestic offering to help finance new construction pavlov told 
the lawmakers 
the 542member bicameral supreme soviet chaired by gorbachev 
has reconvened at a time of widespread turmoil and discontent 
caused by the demands of various ethnic groups and by the staterun 
economys failure to meet many soviets basic needs 
the governments plan for the economy in 1990 calls for a 
onefifth increase in factorymade consumer goods according to 
deputy premier lev voronin 
pavlov said the government plan to cut military spending from 
119 billion to 109 billion is in keeping with the directive from 
the congress of peoples deputies to slash defense spending by 14 
percent by 1991

thousands of vietnamese soldiers pulled 
out of cambodia today rumbling across the border in aging trucks 
and buses in what hanoi says is the end of its involvement in the 
decadelong war in cambodia 
led by officers riding in a usmade jeep and a string of 
sovietmade armored personnel carriers the troops passed by 
thousands of schoolchildren waving flags along highway 1 
the narrow potholed road was one of the main routes from which 
vietnamese forces invaded cambodia in late 1978 and ended nearly 
four years of khmer rouge terror installing a prohanoi government 
there is widespread fear that the khmer rouge which from 1975 
to 1978 sent hundreds of thousands of cambodians to their death as 
it tried to turn the country into a primitive agrarian commune 
could fight its way back to power 
in a radio report received today khmer rouge guerrillas said 
they captured two more positions in western cambodia and killed or 
wounded a number of vietnamese soldiers 
and in a message to his countrymen cambodian president heng 
samrin today appealed to the army the communist party and the 
people to unite as a rocklike bloc to prevent the reemergence 
of the khmer rouge 
in ho chi minh city today government officials said vietnam and 
cambodia would renegotiate a peace and friendship treaty 
imposed on the cambodian government soon after it was installed 
the treaty in essence a mutual defense pact conflicts with 
cambodias stated goal of neutrality 
the officials said vietnamese arms shipments military advice 
and intelligence will last as long as nations such as china and 
thailand continue to support the guerrilla resistance front 
vietnamese foreign minister nguyen co thach today urged a halt 
to outside military support for cambodias warring factions in 
order to avert a civil war 
vietnamese schools were closed to mark the troops return and 
relatives of soldiers ran across the border at moc bai 
i am so happy to be leaving cambodia said a soldier from 
can tho province as his 3yearold daughter tugged at his hair 
my wife is more beautiful now than ever said another 
soldier as he held hands with his spouse the young woman dressed 
up in a skirt and blouse had sprinted the last few yards to 
embrace her husband 
in addition to the 10000 troops crossing at moc bai vietnam 
soldiers crossed over at port towns on the mekong river and at 
several other locations overland in all vietnam said its last 
26000 troops were coming home today 
logistics and artillery divisions along with wounded soldiers 
crossed the border at samat several miles north of moc bai tanks 
and armored personnel carriers arrived at the port town of rach gai 
outside of moc bai villagers crowded around the trucks to cheer 
the soldiers many waved vietnamese flags some threw flowers to 
the troops 
welcome home many people shouted 
but many soldiers said they were worried about their future 
vietnam has said it will demobilize many after the withdrawal and 
unemployment is high 
for the past decade tens of thousands of vietnamese troops have 
been in cambodia helping the phnom penh government battle a 
coalition of guerrilla groups whose strongest faction is the khmer 
rouge 
both the hanoi and pnom penh governments hope the withdrawal 
will convince countries to end economic and diplomatic boycotts 
imposed after vietnams invasion 
phnom penhs premier hun sen says he also hopes the pullout will 
persuade china and thailand to stop aiding the three guerrilla 
groups 
after the withdrawal of vietnamese troops the war will 
continue hun sen told reporters sunday as to the scope of the 
war we think it will depend on foreign countries he said 
the guerrillas have called the troop withdrawal a sham and say 
thousands of vietnamese troops will remain disguised as cambodians 
at a series of farewell ceremonies over the past six days in key 
provincial towns cambodians cheered the departing troops and 
praised the communist solidarity between the two neighboring 
countries 
some cambodians said they welcomed the withdrawal while others 
said they feared the khmer rouge which has been on the offensive 
as the vietnamese withdraw 
on monday in a report received today in bangkok khmer rouge 
radio claimed its forces had captured two more positions in the 
west at peam ta and toek sok the guerrillas also claim to have 
captured a major strategic position on the road between the key 
towns of battambang and pailin in western cambodia 
pailin is the center of a remote ruby mining district near 
thailand where the guerrilla groups are based 
western diplomats do not normally consider khmer rouge radio 
reports reliable sources of information 
phnom penhs defense minister gen tea banh has acknowledged 
the guerrillas have seized teritory near pailin but said the area 
remained under government control 
cambodian officials have repeatedly assured reporters that they 
are capable of fighting the guerrillas without vietnamese military 
support but concede that some phnom penh residents have begun 
stocking rice and other staples in anticipation of a cutoff of 
supplies to the capital 
in 1975 khmer rouge forces encircled the city forcing the 
withdrawal of us embassy personnel on april 12 and the fall of 
the usbacked lon nol government five days later 
in the decade since vietnams invasion the number of khmer 
rouge troops has fallen from 170000 to 17000 vietnamese army 
officials say

on the basis of a new sectarian compromise contained in the 
committees draft plan declared walid jumblatt leader of the 
syrianbacked druse moslem progressive socialist party 
his remarks published by the independent annahar daily 
reflected the hostility between syrias moslem and leftist allies 
and the christians who have long dominated lebanons political 
system 
shiite moslem militia chieftain nabih berri also criticized the 
proposed reforms which aim to split power equally saying they 
were not enough 
the constitution which they want to change gives us more than 
the arab committees plan for reforms he said 
berri did not elaborate but he has been insisting that 
lebanons 12 millinstrong shiites the countrys largest sect 
should have a greater share of power than other sects 
the remarks by jumblatt and berri underlined the fragility of 
the ceasefire brokered by an arab league committee that took 
effect saturday 
the truce was part of a sevenpoint peace plan forged by king 
fahd of saudi arabia king hassan ii of morocco and president 
chadli bendjedid of algeria in an effort to end the civil war that 
has claimed more than 150000 lives 
the criticism came as arab league mediator lakhdar alibrahimi 
an algerian met christian legislators to discuss a planned meeting 
by lebanons parliament in saudi arabia on saturday on the proposed 
political reforms 
ibrahimi deputy secretarygeneral of the arab league later 
told reporters the balls now in the legislators court 
legislator jibran taouk said maronite deputies will announce 
our stand on the reforms wednesday after a meeting with gen aoun 
beiruts leftist assafir daily reported that aoun was also 
exerting pressure on christian parliamentary deputies prior to 
their departure for saudi arabia 
aoun a maronite was believed to be pushing the christian 
deputies not to give too much away in saudi arabia 
the venue was selected because it will allow the deputies to 
discuss the reforms far from any pressure by the powerful militia 
leaders 
the militias do not have representatives in parliament which 
was elected in 1972 the civil war has prevented elections and the 
house has regularly renewed its fouryear mandate 
a sunni moslem parliamentary deputy speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the warlords were upset because deep down they 
dont want an end to the war 
it gave them privileges which theyll lose the moment peace 
prevails a parliamentary meeting is stripping them of the 
capability to steer events thats why theyre rejecting in advance 
what well agree on in saudi arabia he said 
the arab league peace plan calls for ending the christians 45 
years of domination of lebanons political system 
the shiites long downtrodden but now the most powerful moslem 
faction in lebanon in particular are demanding sweeping reforms 
that would strip the maronites of their privileges 
at the vatican today pope john paul ii issued the vaticans 
first formal appeal to moslems and pleaded for their help in saving 
lebanon 
let your voices be heard and even more unite your efforts 
with those who demand for lebanon the right to live the pope 
said 
the pontiff also said i firmly intend to go to lebanon but a 
vatican spokesman said no immediate trip was planned

jurors wont be treated to a bette midler 
concert in her 10 million lawsuit against ford motor co but they 
may hear her recordings a judge ruled 
us district judge a wallace tashima on monday said midler may 
not sing in court at the trial which will decide whether ford and 
the young amp rubicam ad agency used a soundalike to impersonate 
her in a 1985 car commercial 
lawyers for ford and the ad agency sought the ruling contending 
that midler might alter her voice in court to mimic the singer in 
the commercial 
midlers lawyer peter laird said it hasnt been decided 
exactly how her music will be presented to the jury 
young amp rubicam hired a former backup singer for midler to sing 
do you want to dance in a mercury sable commercial after 
midlers manager turned down an opportunity for her to sing in the 
tv ad the court said 
midler known to music fans as the divine miss m sued in 
1987 
a judge threw out the case saying the ad agency had acted like 
the average thief but broke no law but an appeals court 
reinstated the lawsuit last year ruling that to impersonate her 
voice is to pirate her identity 
the singeractress recently has focused her talents on movie 
roles in such films as beaches outrageous fortune and

an entire lake has been liquidated so to 
speak sold to two businessmen for 110000 at a lakeside auction 
the bidding for hoosac lake a 120yearold reservoir built to 
provide water power for mills was part of a bankruptcy proceeding 
begun eight years ago by the nowdefunct arnold print works the 
sale is subject to court approval 
the winning bid in mondays auction held on a causeway spanning 
the 566acre lake in the berkshire hills of western massachusetts 
was entered by raymond shea jr of framingham and s john loscocco 
of north oxford 
shea said he and loscocco own about half a dozen bodies of water 
in central massachusetts that are used mainly for recreation 
we have an interest in water shea said we havent really 
developed anything and we dont have any plans at this point to do 
any developing 
along with the lake they get 50 acres on the shore 
some cheshire residents were aprehensive about the sale fearing 
that a private owner might charge admission or erect large 
developments 
some had hoped the auction would flop proving the lake doesnt 
have commercial potential and possibly opening the door for its 
donation to the town or state cheshire had been paying 750 a year 
to use the lake 
town officials had said the lake would be a bad buy because of 
the cost of weeding expected to be 31000 this year and because 
of the age of its dam 
the lake was created in the 1860s when a group of manufacturers 
bought land and dammed the hoosac river to produce water power 
in 1912 the hoosac reservoir co was formed to oversee 
management of the water arnold print works was the last remaining 
shareholder of that company

two days after a shootout between offduty 
soldiers and neighbors suspected of selling drugs officials moved 
to ease tension by holding a community meeting doubling patrols 
and calling in a justice department specialist 
army sgt bill foulk whose neighborhood barbecue turned from an 
anticrime gathering into a 30minute gunfight saturday night 
maintained monday that he and fellow members of an elite rangers 
unit acted in selfdefense 
they shot at us and we fired back he said pointing at a 
reputed crack house across the street 
police arrested two suspected gang members on assault and 
weapons charges confiscated guns including two semiautomatic 
rifles from the rangers and doubled patrols in the workingclass 
hilltop neighborhood 
no one was injured but scuffles and brickthrowing followed on 
sunday between rangers supporters and neighbors who said they were 
being falsely accused of drug dealing 
the hill is feeling such intensity right now the rev david 
alger said monday these people up here need to be protected im 
surprised it escalated the way it did thats not whats meant by 
community mobilization but on the other hand people are really 
frightened 
what we do now is the question 
police chief ray fjetland said the incident could have been 
avoided had residents called police 
foulk said the gang members were upset that he was videotaping 
their activities he said he called additional rangers to his party 
when he felt threatened because police are too slow and equipped to 
act only after violence begins 
when somebody starts shooting at me and my family im going 
to shoot back he said 
a neighbor complained that racism was involved prompting police 
to call in a us justice department community relations 
investigator 
the gang members are mostly black and of course they want to 
turn this into something racial said foulk who is white he 
said the neighborhood antidrug coalition is multiracial and no 
racism was involved 
fellow ranger sgt russell nolte who is black said four of the 
rangers involved in the shooting were black 
fjetland attended a monday night community meeting organized by 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
were seriously concerned about the way blacks are treated by 
the police said the rev oscar tillman tacoma chapter 
president he also criticized residents 
you do not get trained soldiers using weapons of death in a 
neighborhood that small and believe youre going to come out a 
winner he said 
foulk said the rangers acted on their own time with their own 
weapons army officials said they would await completion of a 
police investigation before deciding whether disciplinary action is 
warranted 
but maj clyde newman secondincommand of the 2nd ranger 
battalion at nearby fort lewis said that from everything i am 
told by the city police the rangers were right they were having a 
party and they were attacked

vote wednesday on whether yugoslavias most liberal republic should 
be allowed to secede despite warnings that authorities could 
impose a state of emergency 
the communist partys policysetting central committee the 
slovenian central committee and the federal parliament scheduled 
emergency sessions today to discuss the political crisis sparked by 
the proposed amendments to the republics constitution 
slovenian lawmakers in the federal parliament said they would 
boycott the belgrade session

lasting and inalienable right to proclaim selfdetermination 
including the right of secession

and to authorize the use of yugoslav army units in the republic 
slovenia which borders italy austria and hungary is the most 
prosperous and westwardlooking of yugoslavias six constituent 
republics it has already allowed an unprecedented degree of 
democratization including the formation of several independent 
political parties

the amendments as being contrary to the federal constitution 
the collective state presidency in charge of the armed forces 
said monday it will use all legal measures to prevent the 
adoption of the amendments indicating it might proclaim a state of 
emergency in the northern republic

do they conflict with the yugoslav constitution

an aids patient advocacy group says it will 
import a widely prescribed aids drug because the us manufacturer 
is overcharging for it an accusation the company strongly denies 
today we fight business with business derek hodel director 
of the people with aids health group said monday he charged that 
the drug pentamidine is priced now for the privileged few 
hodel said his organization a selfdescribed guerrilla 
drugstore is arranging purchases of pentamidine in england at 
less than half the us price the group hopes to pressure the 
american maker to lower its price here 
a spokesman for the us manufacturer lyphomed inc of 
rosemont ill said its price was appropriate given what the 
company spent on research and said importation of the drug 
probably violates federal law 
pwa health group maintained its action is legal 
the food and drug administration is investigating a spokesman 
said 
aids cripples the bodys defenses against disease there is no 
cure but some drugs have been shown to help aids patients live 
longer one of the best known azt has also been the focus of 
criticism from aids activists who say it is overpriced 
pentamidine inhaled as an aerosol helps ward off a form of 
pneumonia that is the leading cause of death for aids patients 
lyphomed sells monthly doses wholesale for 9945 and 
pharmacies mark that up to 105 and more in europe a version 
produced by a french company rhonepoulenc sells for about 30 
per monthly dose retail pwa health group said it can fill us 
prescriptions abroad at a retail cost of 40 per dose including 
handling 
lyphomed spokesman stuart fischer said the drug is profitable 
but he would not give figures he said the company spent 20 
million testing it and developing the procedure by which it is 
inhaled rather than injected 
no other manufacturer was willing to do that he said 
when the chips were down lyphomed was there fischer said 
yes the drug is profitable but we are not profiteers 
he said lyphomed agreed to research pentamidine in the early 
1980s when the fda concerned about erratic supply sought a us 
manufacturer the fda granted lyphomed an exclusive license for 
seven years beginning in 1984 
dr bernard bihari an aids specialist who joined the pwa health 
group at its announcement called lyphomeds price for the drug 
unconscionable 
its a wonderful treatment a very effective one a 
lifesaving treatment bihari said and for anything to 
interfere with the availability of that lifesaving treatment is 
unacceptable 
pwa health group chiefly helps aids patients buy personal 
supplies of prescription drugs that are legal abroad but not 
licensed for sale in this country such purchases are allowed by 
the fda so long as the drugs are not bogus or dangerous 
the group helps fill prescriptions for several hundred people 
mostly in the new york metropolitan area with sales of about 1 
million last year 
the importation of pentamidine is the first case in which the 
group has imported a drug that is already sold here 
pwa health group said virtually everyone diagnosed with aids may 
be put on pentamidine at some point to help prevent pneumonia the 
group said it hopes to to supply the drug to several thousand 
people mostly in the metropolitan area 
federal authorities report that more than 100000 people have 
been diagnosed with aids in the united states about 40000 of whom 
are still alive they estimate that more than 250000 people will 
have been diagnosed with aids by the end of 1991

the author of legislation virtually 
eliminating congressional mass mailings and using the savings for 
drug treatment programs criticized housesenate negotiators today 
for their decision to drop the measure 
that is a disgrace sen pete wilson rcalif told his 
colleagues on the senate floor 
wilson who is running for governor of california next year and 
hopes to leave the senate complained that federal aid for drug 
treatment programs is not remotely sufficient he said 
lawmakers refusal to transfer funds from mailings to drug efforts 
is a signal to the public that as far as congress is concerned 
our first priority is ourselves 
the decision monday by a housesenate conference committee to 
save the mailings was an embarrassing aboutface for the house 
only two hours before in a nonbinding 245137 vote the house 
instructed its conference members to back senate language virtually 
ending the free mailings 
the conferees accepted a compromise to continue the mailings 
but drop the number from six annually to three the proposal was 
introduced by rep vic fazio dcalif who pronounced the house 
vote a fraud as soon as it ended 
this was not a vote to instruct the conferees so much as it 
was a vote to pose for holy pictures he said its pure 
demagoguery but its great politics 
in the conference however fazio and rep david obey dwis 
saved their wrath for the senate for starting the antifree mailing 
campaign on sept 7 at the time senators voted 838 for an 
amendment to ban all newsletters town meeting notices and mailings 
to more than 500 households 95 percent of the mass mailings 
according its sponsor sen pete wilson rcalif 
fazio told senate conferees harry reid dnev and don nickles 
rokla that senators wanted the house to do your dirty work 
by saving the mass mailings after senators went on record as 
opposing the newsletters 
reid accepted the compromise to continue the mailings on a 
reduced scale nickels opposed the move but no formal conference 
vote was taken once he admitted that fazios compromise would pass 
the conferees must now submit their proposal separately to the 
house and senate each of which would face the possibility of an 
embarrassing reversal the bill approved by the conferees would 
appropriate 19 billion to run congress in the next fiscal year 
wilson sought to transfer the estimated 45 million in savings 
from the antimailing plan to a treatment program for pregnant 
women addicted to drugs 
fazio said he was angry the senate tried to meddle in house 
affairs by controlling the mailings of both chambers and obey 
threatened future amendments to change senate rules which are far 
less strict in the use of campaign money for office expenses 
they want to keep their slush funds while posing for 
headlines obey said of senators 
obey said the senate used the same tactic earlier this year by 
overwhelmingly rejecting a proposed 51 percent pay raise for 
congress while secretly counting on the house to pass an increase 
the pay plan collapsed 
rep silvio conte rmass who offered the house resolution on 
mailings to follow the senates lead said he would refuse to sign 
the conference report because we gave away the store 
conte documenting what he called abuses of mass mailings said 
that in the 1988 fiscal year which ended about a month before 
congressional elections the cost of house newsletters rose 
steadily as the election approached from 59 million the first 
quarter to 16 million in the last quarter senate mass mailings 
rose from 38 million in the first quarter to 10 million in the 
fourth quarter 
we really created a frankenstein conte said the only way 
were going to free ourselves from this monster is to cut its head 
off and use it for something worthwhile 
the language on mass mailing would establish separate mass mail 
accounts 545 million or 65 percent of the total for the 
435member house and 293 million or 35 percent for the 
100member senate in addition the provision calls for 317 
million to cover mailing costs through the end of 1989 
currently there are six mass mailings of newsletters a year 
but they would be reduced to three beginning next jan 1 there 
would be a twosheet limit

investigators believe they have found traces of a 
powerful plastic explosive in the wreckage of a french dc10 
airliner that exploded over the niger desert two french newspapers 
reported today 
the dailies liberation and le parisien said the discovery 
strengthened the link between last weeks uta crash and the 
december 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland 
the news accounts quoting unidentified sources involved in the 
inquiry said the presence of semtex a malleable and 
difficulttodetect explosive made in czechoslovakia still had to 
be confirmed by laboratory tests in paris 
liberation reported the explosive may have been hidden in a 
shipment of farm chemicals put on the plane in brazzaville congo 
where it originated 
the plane disappeared less than an hour after takeoff following 
a stopover in ndjamena chad all 171 people aboard were killed 
french investigators have said it appears certain an explosive 
substance in a front cargo compartment caused the crash but have 
not elaborated publicly on what explosive may have been used 
the parallels between last weeks crash and the dec 21 
lockerbie disaster have already been widely noted 
it is believed that a radiocassette player rigged with semtex 
was placed aboard the pan am flight in frankfurt that made a change 
of planes in london before the explosion 
the syrianbacked popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command is considered the prime suspect behind 
that attack though the groups leader ahmed jibril has denied 
involvement 
police in west germany seized an air pressureactivated bomb 
hidden in a radio when they raided houses and apartments occupied 
by suspected radical palestinians in october last year 
a british television inquiry into the flight 103 bombing said 
monday that west germany committed major blunders including 
releasing the probable bombmaker after the october raid 
the british broadcasting corps current affairs program 
panorama said investigators are convinced jibrils group 
masterminded the attack 
west german authorities arrested 16 men in the october raid but 
released 14 of them including a jordanian marwan khreesat 
panorama said khreesat is widely believed to have made the 
lockerbie bomb and several others 
asked why khreesat was released hansjuergen foerster 
spokesman for the west german prosecutors office said monday 
he was released because there was no urgent suspicion of his 
connection with a crime 
claims of responsibility for the uta crash from anonymous 
callers in beirut and london on behalf of the moslem extremist 
group islamic jihad and a previously unknown chadian organization 
have not been authenticated french police appear to be treating 
the claims with great skepticism 
on monday investigating magistrate jeanlouis bruguieres an 
antiterrorism specialist heading the criminal investigation 
officially called on the dst frances counterespionage police to 
aid in the probe judicial sources said 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said bruguieres 
made a specific written request to the direction de la surveillance 
du territoire for assistance the sources said they did not know 
exactly what tasks the agencys officers were called on to 
undertake

urine samples taken two days after a usair jet 
skidded into the east river contained no sign of drug or alcohol 
use by the pilot or copilot prosecutors say 
the test results were made public by the office of queens 
district attorney john j santucci on monday the same day he 
announced that a grand jury would look into the crash that killed 
two people last week 
tests on samples taken from the pilot and copilot on friday 
showed no evidence of drugs such as cocaine heroin or 
amphetamines or alcohol said santucci spokesman richard piperno 
results of similar tests by the national transportation safety 
board will not be available for several weeks 
the captain michael w martin and copilot constantine 
kleissas were criticized by federal officials for failing to 
submit to testing immediately after the crash although they are 
not legally required to do so 
medical experts said alcohol would not normally show up in urine 
samples taken two days after ingestion but that traces of drugs 
such as marijuana or cocaine probably would 
the test means that they were free of drugs and or alcohol at 
the time that the sample was taken piperno said today 
the jet en route to charlotte nc skidded into the east 
river after the crew tried to abort takeoff at laguardia airport on 
wednesday 
investigators said the copilot reported he inadvertently 
punched a button that cut the throttle and the pilot told 
officials that he aborted takeoff because of a vibration and 
because the jet began to veer for some reason 
the pilots lawyer frederick hafetz said the results come as 
no surprise we had fully anticipated they would be negative and 
indeed peoples observations of the pilots on the night of the 
flight was totally consistent with their being in full control of 
themselves 
piperno said he also knew of no evidence indicating the men were 
under the influence at the time of the crash 
in announcing the criminal investigation santucci said he had 
no prospective targets and would not seek specific criminal 
charges among the things the grand jury would investigate was how 
the crew was picked for the flight he said 
the two men flying together for the first time had been chosen 
from a pool of pilots with the least seniority the copilot who 
had flown a boeing 737400 only once before on a regular passenger 
flight was attempting his first takeoff in that model with 
passengers aboard both pilots had been working about 12 hours 
santuccis decision to investigate is unusual if not 
unprecedented airline insiders said 
were not aware of criminal charges in the past ever being 
brought here in the united states against an airline pilot 
following a crash said john macor a spokesman for the air line 
pilots association in washington 
hafetz said he had no comment on the investigation 
charges that a grand jury might be asked to consider include 
criminally negligent homicide vehicular manslaughter and leaving 
the scene of an accident according to sources in santuccis office 
who requested anonymity 
an airplane is considered a vehicle under new york law

37 million in ministry money to live in style he faces up to 120 
years in prison and more than 5 million in fines if convicted on 
all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy 
on monday a former builder for bakker testified that the rev 
jerry falwell who took over ptl after bakker resigned in a sex and 
money scandal offered bakker a 300000 annual salary for life and 
other perks to keep quiet 
defense attorney george t davis never asked messner what bakker 
was supposed to keep quiet about it was not clear whether bakker

vice president richard dortch told him im going to ask you to 
do a big favor im asking you because i know youll keep it 
confidential 
dortch told messner that if he didnt pay a woman from new york 
265000 then she would go to the charlotte observer with 
allegations that bakker raped her five days later messner said 
he wired the 265000 to an account number in california that was 
given to him by dortch 
messner said he asked dortch if bakker knew about the payment 
and dortch replied no im acting on my own

us embassy officials trying to curtail a 
constant line outside the embassy on tuesday announced new rules on 
emigration procedures aimed at lightening the work load in moscow 
and limiting the number of wouldbe emigrants 
the announcement was made to an agitated crowd of several 
hundred soviets who were gathered around the embassy seeking 
permission to emigrate or visit the united states dozens pushed 
and grabbed for the onesheet explanation of the rules which take 
effect oct 1 
according to the document applications for emigration now will 
have to be sent to washington instead of being dealt with in moscow 
because of the flood of requests pouring into the embassy here 
lines of hundreds of people have been forming around the embassy 
every day since soviet officials began liberalizing emigration 
policies last year there have been reports recently that spaces in 
line are going for hundreds of dollars 
the united states will continue to receive applications from 
all interested soviet citizens but priority in scheduling 
interviews will be given to those with close relatives who are 
citizens or legal residents of the united states as well as those 
of special concern to the united states according to the 
document handed out tuesday 
many who have no close family ties in the united states will 
face long delays and may wish to explore alternative destinations 
not all those who apply will be given appointments it warned 
soviets will be notified by mail from washington if they are to 
be interviewed in the embassy in moscow 
soviets using israeli visas mostly jews will not be able to 
apply for entrance to the united states in rome or vienna if their 
soviet exit visa is dated after oct 1 the document said many 
soviet jews are waiting in those cities for admission to the united 
states instead of going to israel 
the genevabased international commission for migration said 
more than 30000 soviet jews had arrived at its transit point in 
vienna from january through august 
the head of the soviet visa office rudolf kuznetsov said on 
aug 22 that 200000 soviets are expected to emigrate this year 
besides the united states many want to go to west germany about 
50000 people mostly ethnic germans had left for west germany by 
the end of august 
a senior us official in moscow said earlier this month that 
the embassy had received 10000 new applications in august alone 
adding to a backlog of 32000 cases 
the number of people applying to go to the states is 
skyrocketing and going far beyond the cap on refugees he said 
the great majority of people leaving cannot qualify under the law 
to be refugees and most are not claiming to be refugees 
compared to 1988 when 85 percent to 90 percent of the 
applicants were armenians in august 45 percent of the applicants 
were jews 35 percent were armenians and 10 percent were russians 
he said he said 70 percent of the russians had no relatives at all 
in the united states 
a us official said the embassy will monitor the list of 
interviews granted by washington and the number of people who 
appear for an interview to determine whether the soviet mail system 
can be trusted to deliver notification

parliament today adopted liberal laws 
that guarantee free travel abroad and emigration the first of a 
sweeping set of changes intended transform communist hungary into a 
multiparty democracy 
the new laws lifted most restrictions on travel meaning that 
hungarians no longer require permission from authorities for 
foreign travel or emigration 
hungarys liberal policies in this respect were demonstrated by 
a government decision in may to begin removing barbed wire fencing 
and other obstacles on its border with austria 
this warsaw pact country also allowed thousands of east germans 
seeking to emigrate to the west to cross legally into austria 
angering its hardline allies 
the session that opened today is to decide a series of key bills 
that are to pave the way for next years elections in june the 
first free and open multiparty balloting in more than 40 years of 
communist rule 
the volume of legislation prompted lawmkers to vote for an 
extension of the session in october after a twoweek break to allow 
lawmakers to study the draft laws the current session was 
originally scheduled to end friday 
legislators will have to vote on six key bills including one on 
the functioning of political parties a new electoral law the 
establishment of a constitutional court and changes in the penal 
code 
the legislators today approved membership of four opposition 
members who received a majority at recent byelections marking the 
first time members of the opposition took their seats in the 
communistdominated assembly 
gabor roszik the first opposition member elected in july was 
accompanied to the parliament building by supporters waving flags 
democracy has returned to parliament after a 40year exile 
roszik told the house 
this is one of the most significant steps of the revolution 
underway in hungary as we move from dictatorial socialism to 
democracy roszik said the millions of hungarians have never 
paid such close attention to our work as they do now 
the bills before parliament this week are designed to bring 
legislation in line with preparations for the multiparty 
elections which would be the first since the communists 
consolidated power in 1948 
more than 70 percent of the 387 members of parliament are 
communists socalled independent candidates elected after 1985 
when hungary instituted multicandidate elections had to be 
approved by a communistaffiliated organization 
parliament is also expected to discuss the creation of a post of 
president which would replace the current 21man collective 
presidency and determine the date and form of his election 
there has been considerable pressure for the president to be 
elected before the end of the year to provide political stability 
during the transition phase before the elections 
hungary like warsaw pact ally poland has embraced and in fact 
exceeded the liberal reforms and progressive politics encouraged by 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
both nations are seeking closer trade and investment ties to the 
west to improve their economies as they pursue social reforms 
moves that have alienated them from such hardline warsaw pact 
nations as east germany and czechoslovakia

a military tribunal in burma has 
sentenced five people to death for beheading three people they 
wrongly suspected of poisoning drinking water during last years 
prodemocracy uprising state radio said 
rangoon radio said in a broadcast monday that two men and one 
woman were beheaded at the junction of u wisara and shwedagon 
pagoda roads in rangoon during last years disturbances 
the victims were falsely accused of poisoning drinking 
water the radio said 
the report received in bangkok on tuesday did not give the 
date of the incident but western news reports at the the time 
described the beheadings on sept 8 last year when crowds of up to 
a million paraded through rangoon demanding an end to years of 
authoritarian rule 
rangoon radio said the tribunal heard that ma may khine kicked 
the woman accused of poisoning the water and barbarously severed 
her head another defendant aye cho used a sword to behead 
one of the men it said 
two others nan lwin and shwe toe helped with the killings and 
helped hang the severed heads on a signboard at the road junction 
the report said 
the fifth convicted po lu also assisted in the murders 
posed for pictures with the severed heads tied one on a bamboo 
pole and displayed it by marching along and helped burn the 
corpses the radio said 
at the end of last month a military tribunal in northwestern 
burma sentenced 11 people to death for beheading four policemen 
also during the uprising 
last years demonstrations were crushed after a series of bloody 
army clampdowns in which thousands were killed 
the government has used the sporadic violence that occurred 
during the largely peaceful protests to justify its use of force 
against dissent saying the country was on the verge of anarchy it 
continues to rule by martial law 
some dissidents have blamed the violence and rumors such as 
those surrounding the poisoning of drinking water on 
governmentpaid provocateurs 
western diplomats in rangoon say several thousand prodemocracy 
activists have been arrested since opposition leaders aung san suu 
kyi and tin oo were placed under house arrest july 19

handicapped people demanding wheelchair lifts on 
public buses blocked entrances to a federal building for a second 
day today after president bush let them spend the night rather than 
send them out into the rain 
two officials of the urban mass transit administration arrived 
with a third unidentified official just before noon today to meet 
with protest leaders 
but the 80 or so demonstrators many in wheelchairs made good 
on a vow to block entrances of the main level of the richard b 
russell building at noon if their demands were not met 
the activists began the demonstration monday when at least two 
dozen chained themselves to doors or blocked exits with their 
wheelchairs 
this is a real national effort and we want people to know 
about it said marca bristo 36 of chicago one of the protest 
organizers 
the demonstrators want a federal order requiring all new public 
buses bought with federal funds to be equipped with wheelchair 
lifts government officials have estimated this would cost 90 
million a year 
bush intervened monday night after authorities ejected several 
protesters and organizers said they would continue demonstrating 
outside in a cold downpour 
gary cason regional administrator for the general services 
administration said the president ordered that the demonstrators 
be brought in out of the rain 
hes concerned about their plight and their safety cason 
said 
but protest organizer mike auberger of denver colo said his 
group american disabled for accessible public transportation 
would step up the protest to dispel the notion that bush is openly 
addressing their demands 
the administration up to now was willing to throw us out if 
we dont do something theyll just let us sit here auberger 
said 
were going to close it back down again they need to know our 
issue isnt going away 
adapt members are demanding that us transportation secretary 
samuel skinner sign an executive order requiring the lifts they 
said they also want the administration to implement a 1986 law 
requiring better disabled access at airports 
the protesters say they wontt move until skinner who visited 
atlanta on monday for the american public transportation 
associations convention signs the order 
cason said no decision had been made as to whether the 
protesters would be removed today 
well play it as we go he said 
the demonstrators blockade near the main entrances to the 
building monday forced employees and others to leave use an exit on 
the lower level 
adapt has also been trying to force the installation of lifts on 
all new buses through the courts in philadelphia a federal 
appeals panel backed their lawsuit saying federal law requires 
lifts on new buses 
but in july the full 3rd us circuit court of appeals 
overturned that ruling saying government officials did not have to 
put lifts on all buses if they thought some other method of serving 
the handicapped would be better 
michael churchill an attorney for adapt said the group was 
waiting to see what congress did on the bus issue before deciding 
whether to appeal

with growing international prestige 
president hosni mubarak goes to the united states this week seeking 
american help with an israelipalestinian peace plan and dialogue 
he has proposed 
mubarak will urge president bushs administration to take 
concrete action instead of just expressing cautious approval as it 
has done so far egyptian officials said 
egypt wants washington to nudge israels likud party led by 
prime minister yitzhak shamir into accepting the dialogue and a 
10point guideline plan according to egyptian officials speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
mubarak arrives in new york on thursday and will meet bush in 
washington on monday egyptian officials call the washington talks 
crucial 
its crucial in the sense that it may make or break current 
peace efforts involving the dialogue proposal israels plan for 
palestinian elections and mubaraks 10point formula to spruce up 
that plan a senior government official said 
osama elbaz mubaraks political adviser told reporters that 
mubarak will talk with bush to crystallize an american position 
bolstering egypts efforts to open a palestinianisraeli dialogue 
a government official who asked that his name be withheld for 
diplomatic reasons spoke bluntly we want the united states to 
step in with its full clout and put pressure on israel 
israels labor party junior partner in shamirs cabinet 
coalition generally approves mubaraks suggestion of an 
israelipalestinian dialogue in cairo to discuss palestinian 
elections in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
shamir has rejected mubaraks key ideas in public remarks but 
his divided cabinet is to take a final decision next month 
in may shamir proposed elections to choose representatives to 
negotiate with israel on interim selfrule for the two territories 
where about 17 million palestinians live in july mubarak put 10 
questions to israel urging affirmative answers that would make the 
election proposal more palatable to the palestinians 
the mubarak approach would guarantee freedom of the balloting 
under international supervision and allow 140000 palestinian 
residents of israeliannexed east jerusalem to vote it also would 
link the election to an eventual final settlement based on israel 
giving up occupied territory for peace 
mubarak has said palestine liberation organization leader yasser 
arafat accepts the egyptian blueprint but the plo which wants an 
official israeli stand first has delayed an official position 
pending a meeting of its central council in midoctober 
mubarak whose peacemaking efforts have turned cairo into a 
diplomatic beehive has seen his stature grow considerably in the 
arab world in the past two years 
most arab countries that broke with egypt over its 1979 peace 
treaty with israel have restored diplomatic relations and cairo 
regained its arab league membership in may after a 10year 
suspension 
in february mubarak arranged for visiting soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze to meet separately in cairo with 
arafat and israeli foreign minister moshe arens 
during his new york stop mubarak will thrash out his and 
israels peace ideas at meetings with shevardnadze arens and 
finance minister shimon peres of israel

the following are excerpts from soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadzes speech tuesday to the 
general assembly 
 
we welcome the proposal concerning chemical weapons put forward 
yesterday by president bush 
generally consistent with the wellknown initiatives of the 
soviet leadership it indicates to us that we share the desire to 
rid mankind of those barbaric weapons 
the soviet union is ready together with the united states to 
go further and assume mutual obligations prior to the conclusion of 
a multilateral convention 
cease the production of chemical weapons as we have done 
already i am referring also to binary weapons 
on a bilateral basis radically reduce or completely destroy 
soviet and us chemical weapons regarding it as a step toward the 
global destruction of chemical weapons 
renounce the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances 
institute rigorous verification of the cessation of production 
of chemical warfare agents 
i think that there is no need to say how beneficial that would 
be for the overall climate in the world 
if nato countries agree to start talks on tactical nuclear 
weapons the ussr will respond by further unilateral cuts in its 
tactical nuclear weapons in europe 
the problem of missile proliferation is also ripe for 
multilateral discussions 
no one in the world can as yet bid a farewell to arms but we 
can abandon once and for all and do it now the practice of 
unconstrained and uncontrolled international weapons transfers 
the ussr is ready to reinstate its moratorium on all nuclear 
explosions any day and hour if the united states reciprocates 
secondly it is time finally to end the procedural impasse at 
the conference on disarmament and start concrete discussions there 
on the problem of a complete test ban 
thirdly as one possible way toward such a ban we are now 
considering the possibility of extending the 1963 treaty to cover

vandals sliced a cable inside a manhole 
cutting service to 12000 telephone lines in what new york 
telephone co said today was the worst case of sabotage since a 
strike against its parent began aug 5 
because of the way it was done it could take several days to 
restore service to everyone said spokesman tony pappas 
about 4000 suburban new york city telephone customers plus 
8000 customers with data lines such as computer services and 
burglar alarm companies lost service he said 
nassau county police officer john lambert said the cable was cut 
monday night pappas said most of the lines cut were copper and 
crews will have to go through neighboring manholes and break 
through walls to run new cable 
you have to have a special tool to lift the manhole cover and 
then have cable cutters he said it was a professional job 
new york telephone says it has sustained 325 acts of vandalism 
statewide affecting about 75000 customers since the communications 
workers went on strike against nynex 
a union spokeswoman did not immediately return a telephone call

los angeles gangs have found a new market for 
their drugs in the midwest and the resulting violence has stirred 
a group of fathers calling themselves mad dads to fight back 
the mad dads armed only with radios patrol ganginfested areas 
of north omaha to break up drug deals and reclaim neighborhoods 
marked as gang turf 
earlier this month they announced plans to use a helicopter 
but a spokesman said monday the group was grounding that idea 
because it caused too much controversy 
formed by fathers angry about gangs known as the bloods and 
crips dealing drugs in their neighborhood mad dads has expanded 
its reach throughout the city 
we felt we had to get out on the streets and start offering to 
our community some semblance of security eddie staton an 
organizer said last week 
if mad dads have done anything citywide its created an 
atmosphere that there are some folks fighting back who have been 
perceived as part of the problem staton said 
police estimate there are about 50 hardcore crips in omaha and 
an equal number of rival bloods each gang also has about 200 
associates and wannabe members in the city police said 
the los angelesbased gangs have established a drug trade laced 
with a kind of violence new to this largely middleclass city of 
350000 
driveby shootings are becoming commonplace and one public 
housing project is so racked by drugs and violence that residents 
have nicknamed it vietnam 
after gang members beat john fosters son foster staton and 
four other men formed a committee that in may became mad dads men 
against destruction defending against drugs and social disorder 
the group has grown from to more than 200 85 percent of whom are 
black staton said 
we had to figure a way of giving the good men in our 
community who are not involved in pimping in drugs in drug sales 
and violence an opportunity to band together and really be heard 
he said 
besides running neighborhood foot patrols mad dads paint over 
gang graffiti and organize drug and alcoholfree parties for 
youths 
other groups as well as police and prosecutors also are fighting 
drugs in omaha and businesses raised 700000 this summer for a 
program to provide needy youngsters jobs job training and 
educational and recreational programs 
staton said the drug and gang problem is rooted in the economic 
conditions of north omaha which he said include 30 percent 
unemployment poor housing inadequate educational opportunities 
and institutional racism 
here comes somebody saying you can take this dope and 
sell it and heres how you can make money a lot of money and you 
can sleep all day and be out having a good time all night thats 
tempting for adults let alone young people staton said 
mad dads believe their strategy of offering positive male role 
models alternatives to gang activity and making drug dealers 
uncomfortable will help crush the gangs 
but the group is gearing up for a long fight 
this is not a battle that just starts today and is going to 
end next week staton said this is a program thats got to be 
put in place now for the next 10 to 20 years of community 
involvement of men being involved in their community in a positive 
way

orders to us factories for big ticket 
durable goods accelerated 38 percent last month riding brisk 
automobile sales to the biggest gain since december the government 
said tuesday 
but some economists questioned whether that volatile 
manufacturing sector could keep up the pace in the face of a 
slowing economy and said the first decline in unfilled orders since 
february 1987 was a sign of weakness 
the commerce department said demand for durable goods items 
expected to last more than three years totaled a seasonally 
adjusted 1267 billion after declining 25 percent in july the 
july figure was revised from a 19 percent drop reported earlier 
after rising 74 percent in december durable goods orders have 
seesawed this year rising in march april june and august and 
falling in january february may and july 
orders in the transportation sector last month rose 63 percent 
to 363 billion as a big increase for motor vehicles offset a 
decline in aircraft transportation orders had risen 18 percent in 
july 
even without the transporation sector durable goods orders were 
up 27 percent after falling 4 percent the previous month 
i doubt that the automobile pace will continue said cynthia 
latta an economist with drimcgrawhill a lexington mass 
business forecasting organization 
she noted that some automakers are reducing their production 
schedules and offering rebates and subsidized financing to spur 
sales of 1990 models even before they get to the showroom 
both ms latta and robert brusca chief financial economist for 
nikko securities co international inc in new york pointed to the 
03 percent decline in unfilled orders as evidence of weakness 
the backlog of orders declined everywhere except 
transportation and thats only because of autos brusca said 
that decline says demand is slackening 
the federal reserve which raised interest rates for 14 months 
to slow the economy and control inflation began in june to nudge 
rates down durable goods orders are particularly sensitive to 
interest rates because consumers and businesses often have to 
borrow to finance such purchases 
nevertheless analysts said tuesdays report would not spur the 
fed to further action 
for now it probably tends to keep the fed on hold brusca 
said 
ms latta agreed saying it cant tune policy to bail out the 
durable goods manufacturers it has to look at the whole economy 
orders for nonelectrical machinery which includes computers 
and a wide variety of industrial equipment increased 92 percent 
to 228 billion but that was a rebound from a 104 percent 
decline in july 
other sectors were down including the closely watched 
nondefense capital goods sector which fell 98 percent to 374 
billion economists watch this category as a barometer of business 
investment plans 
electrical machinery orders declined 09 percent to 196 
billion with communications equipment showing the largest 
decrease primary metals including steel were off 19 percent to 
113 billion 
excluding the defense category which swings widely from month 
to month orders gained 39 percent after falling 15 percent in 
july military orders increased 19 percent to 78 billion after 
plunging 147 percent in july 
shipments of durable goods in august rose 95 percent the 
biggest increase since a 45 percent advance in january 1983 but 
automobiles again accounted for this gain since the commerce 
department considers auto orders and shipments to be the same

the white house today welcomed as a very 
constructive response the soviet unions acceptance of president 
bushs offer to reduce chemical weapons jointly and go beyond that 
to ban the devices under a global agreement 
house speaker thomas p foley called bushs plan for ussoviet 
reductions a good first step but said it does not answer the 
question of how to control chemical weapons production by other 
countries 
shevardnadze in a united nations speech today said moscow will 
join the united states and radically reduce or completely 
destroy all its chemical weapons stockpiles 
he also challenged bush to join the soviet union in stopping 
production of all chemical weapons halting nuclear tests and 
stopping the manufacture of weaponsgrade plutonium and uranium 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
shevardnadzes response shows that we are on the same wavelength 
it was a very constructive response our ultimate objective is 
total elimination of chemical weapons and it appears that both 
nations are now ready to act 
foley said after a meeting of congressional leaders with bush 
something were concerned about trying to bring about is 
participation of third countries and countries that have a 
potential but not yet a significant production 
administration officials contend agreement on chemical weapons 
reduction by the united states and soviet union could also spur the 
smaller countries to sign a ban 
these are steps in the right direction foley said of bushs 
plan i dont think many of us feel that all the potential has 
been explored yet and wed like to urge the president forward but 
certainly these are positive steps 
he said shevardnadzes proposal for a complete abolition of 
chemical weapons by the two superpowers apparently regardless of 
when or whether the smaller countries sign on to a treaty seems 
like an issue worth discussion 
we welcome the proposal concerning chemical weapons put 
forward yesterday by president bush shevardnadze said 
generally consistent with the wellknown initiatives of the 
soviet leadership it indicates to us that we share the desire to 
rid mankind of those barbaric weapons 
bush returned monday night from new york after outlining before 
the united nations his offer of an 80 percent cut in us chemical 
weapons stockpiles 
the proposal designed to spur a 40nation conference in geneva 
to ban all chemical weapons within 10 years would have the two 
superpowers reduce their stockpiles to a level equivalent to 20 
percent of the current us level that would mean deeper cuts for 
the soviets because us officials contend moscow has far greater 
stockpiles than the united states an acknowledged 50000 tons 
compared to an estimated 30000 tons for the united states 
bush proposed a ussoviet agreement to begin those cuts at 
once while a 40nation treaty is being worked out in which the 
united states would destroy 98 percent of its chemical weapons over 
eight years if the soviets joined the ban 
the remaining 2 percent would be destroyed within 10 years if 
all nations capable of building such weapons agreed to a total ban 
while only the united states and soviet union acknowledge having 
chemical weaponry bush said more than 20 nations have such weapons 
or the capability to produce them 
baker told reporters the smaller countries would be persuaded to 
join the ban because i think you bring the force of public 
opinion to bear worldwide on any country that says that theyre 
going to keep them and theyre going to use them 
baker and bushs national security adviser brent scowcroft 
said the united states would consider imposing economic sanctions 
against nations that refused to sign on to a treaty ban 
the united states has condemned iran and iraq for using such 
weapons and said libya was on the verge of production some 
officials suspect syria has a chemical weapons program 
these horrible weapons are now finding their way into regional 
conflicts bush said in his speech this is unacceptable 
bushs proposal came after two days of talks between 
shevardnadze and baker that produced agreement to hold a superpower 
summit next spring or summer the two sides also agreed to exchange 
information about us and soviet chemical weapons and conduct 
crossinspections of arsenals 
bush in his speech heralded signs of a new attitude that 
prevails between the us and ussr 
serious differences remain but the willingness to deal 
constructively and candidly with those differences is news that we 
and indeed the world must welcome he said 
the president said a new world of freedom is emerging around 
the globe 
today we are witnessing an ideological collapse the demise of 
the totalitarian idea of the omniscient allpowerful state he 
said 
twice as vice president bush blocked legislation to destroy 
us chemical weapons by breaking a tie vote in congress but those 
would have been unilateral reductions not tied to soviet 
compliance 
during his first trip to the united nations as president bush 
also met separately monday with the presidents of brazil 
guatemala bolivia and venezuela and israeli deputy prime minister 
shimon peres and foreign minister moshe ahrens then hosted a 
reception and dinner for diplomats and heads of state

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze said today that moscow will match us reductions in 
chemical weapons and he challenged the united states to ban the 
devices completely plus halt nuclear testing 
shevardnadze in a speech to the general assembly said moscow 
will join the united states and radically reduce or completely 
destroy all the chemical weapons it has stockpiled 
but he also issued a new set of challenges he said the soviet 
union will stop production of chemical weapons halt nuclear tests 
and stop making weaponsgrade plutonium and uranium all if 
washington reciprocates 
the speech was a prompt reply from moscow to president bushs 
proposal monday to drastically reduce chemical weapons stockpiles 
the proposal was given to the soviets during the weekend and 
announced by bush in his un address 
bush offered an 80 percent cut in us chemical weapons 
stockpiles if the soviets reciprocate 
the delegates in the hall including secretary of state james 
baker and us ambassador thomas r pickering gave shevardnadze a 
warm round of applause after his speech 
baker met with the soviet foreign minister for about seven 
minutes after the speech but declined to say what they talked 
about 
he said shevardnadzes speech was very responsive to the 
presidents statement he said he had to study it more closely 
but did not think the proposals went beyond those of president bush 
speaking to delegates of 159 nations shevardnadze said moscow 
is ready to reinstate its moratorium on all nuclear explosions 
any day and hour if the united states reciprocates 
moscow has declared several such moratoriums which the united 
states has declined to join us officials said the soviets 
initiated such moratoriums after completing a series of tests 
the soviet foreign minister once again stressed disarmament 
saying that if nato countries agree to start talks on tactical 
nuclear weapons the ussr will respond by further unilateral cuts 
in its tactical nuclear weapons in europe 
he also proposed that the production of nuclear fissionable 
material for weapons be halted and that the ban be verified 
the soviet union has announced that is halting the production of 
enriched uranium 
in 1987 it closed one reactor producing weaponsgrade plutonium 
and shevardnadze said we plan to close down in 1989 and 1990 a 
few more such reactors by the year 2000 all the remaining reactors 
will have been shut down 
he proposed that international atomic energy agency safeguards 
be used for verification and unilaterally offered to put one 
soviet reactor under iaea control to study the feasibility of 
fullscale verification 
on chemical weapons shevardnadze said we welcome the proposal 
concerning chemical weapons put forward yesterday by president bush 
generally consistent with the wellknown initiatives of the 
soviet leadership it indicates to us that we share the desire to 
rid mankind of those barbaric weapons 
he said the soviet union is ready together with the united 
states to go further and assume mutual obligations prior to the 
conclusion of a multilateral convention currently being discussed 
by 40 nations meeting in geneva 
the soviet foreign minister said his nation would join 
washington in 
stopping the production of chemical weapons including binary 
weapons which the united states still manufactures 
agreeing to radically reduce or completely destroy soviet and 
us chemical weapons regarding it as a step toward the global 
destruction of chemical weapons 
renounce the use of chemical weapons under any 
circumstances 
institute rigorous verification of the cessation of 
production of chemical warfare agents 
i think that there is no need to say how beneficial that would 
be for the overall climate in the world said shevardnadze 
bushs proposal designed to spur a 40nation conference in 
geneva to ban all chemical weapons within 10 years would have the 
two superpowers reduce their stockpiles to a level equivalent to 20 
percent of the current us level

the white house gave its endorsement today to 
a senate compromise for funding the war on drugs that would boost 
the presidents plan by 900 million 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said that while 
some details of the bipartisan agreement still need to be worked 
out the plan does appear consistent with our objectives 
we do expect to accept this arrangement and hopefully we can 
get on with implementing the drug plan fitzwater told reporters 
sen robert c byrd dwva chairman of the senate 
appropriations committee earlier said the agreement is not a 
final solution but it is a good first step toward fighting the war 
on drugs 
the american people wanted more than the president requested 
and this gets more byrd told reporters in outlining the plan 
monday night 
the agreement subject to final approval by a handful of key 
senators who were returning to washington today would raise to 
88 billion the antidrug funds for the fiscal year that begins 
oct 1 it includes an acrosstheboard cut of about 043 percent 
in other federal programs to pay for the steppedup drug war 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan called the agreement on 
financing the plan fairly final but he noted disagreements 
remained on when to take up separate legislation enacting parts of 
bushs anticrime package including capital punishment and drug 
testing for those arrested on drug charges 
sen mark o hatfield rore the chief negotiator for senate 
republicans said the white house had agreed to the plan in general 
terms 
bush was traveling monday and had not analyzed the details of 
the proposed agreement said white house spokesman roman popadiuk 
but if it proves consistent with news reports then it may form a 
basis on which we may proceed popadiuk said 
the accord was expected to break a twoweek logjam keeping four 
major spending bills from final senate passage transportation 
foreign aid veterans housing and space and labor health and 
education 
but it appeared impossible for congress to pass in time all of 
the 13 spending bills needed to keep the government running after 
sept 30 and the house was expected today to approve a 25day 
stopgap spending measure the bill would continue the flow of cash 
to federal programs at current levels 
the compromise antidrug figure would be 900 million more than 
bush sought in his sept 5 speech to the nation and 31 billion 
more than is being spent on antidrug programs in the current 
fiscal year congressional democrats had criticized bushs request 
as too little to make headway against the drug scourge 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said the 
agreement would substantially improve the presidents drug 
package and added he was gratified that the administration has 
agreed to support necessary funding for the drug program 
while the compromise figure went a little less than halfway 
toward the 22 billion increase byrd originally proposed nearly 
all of the increase 800 million would be devoted to drug 
treatment education and prevention programs that democrats said 
were most seriously underfunded in bushs outline 
hatfield sought to minimize any democratic advantage from the 
accord by pointing to bushs leadership in proposing the antidrug 
package in the first place 
this is a bipartisan war hatfield said adding that he 
expected many senate republicans to support the compromise package 
the democrats dont have any greater degree of support for the 
drug war than the republicans 
left unresolved were several legislative initiatives bush had 
proposed on habeas corpus and the death penalty to strengthen the 
prosecution of drug dealers those awaited talks with senate 
judiciary committee chairman joseph biden ddel who was out of 
town on monday 
discussions aimed at finding a compromise broke off on friday 
after an apparent stalemate was reached byrd the chief democratic 
negotiator complained that the white house had been a shadow 
participant in the negotiations and was causing the breakdown 
but hatfield said byrd telephoned him friday night and the two 
met on saturday to begin putting the talks back on track 
a substantial part of the compromise involved the mechanism to 
pay for the increased antidrug programs the acrosstheboard cut 
would hit most government programs equally excluding social 
security and other federal benefits 
that would mean a dent of about 13 billion in next years 
2882 billion pentagon budget but in the case of defense 
spending the agreement allows the flexibility the administration 
had sought to allocate the cuts to areas where the pinch can be 
minimized 
sen ted stevens ralaska the senior gop member of the defense 
appropriations subcommittee said the cuts probably would be aimed 
at plans for new weapons procurement in order to protect crucial 
areas like personnel and military readiness and weapons 
productions lines already in operation

an east german emissary today told 
east germans holed up in the west german embassy that they can 
legally emigrate to the west but first must return home a 
spokesmen for the refugees said 
wolfgang vogel arrived today to speak to representatives of 
about 1200 east germans who have crowded the garden of the west 
german embassy in hopes of obtaining safe passage to the west 
after meeting with vogel between 50 and 60 east germans boarded 
a bus that reportedly took them to a prague railroad station for 
their journey back to east germany the others however remained 
in the embassy quarters and it was unclear if they refused the east 
german offer 
vogel is an east berlin lawyer who has close contacts with the 
east german leadership 
refugees who took part in the negotiations told reporters 
waiting outside the embassy that vogel gave them a personal 
guarantee they could emigrate once they returned home 
already more than 20000 east germans have fled to west germany 
via hungary which incensed east germanys communist leaders when 
it opened its border to the west on sept 11 
in warsaw poland dozens of other east germans arrived monday 
outside the closed west german embassy to seek passage to the west 
some said they swam rivers by night or walked through forests on 
the polisheast german border 
in prague a western reporter on monday afternoon witnessed some 
40 new arrivals scale the 7foot fence of the west germany embassy 
in the conspicuous absence of czechoslovak police who had earlier 
patrolled the street outside urging reporters to leave 
by nightfall the number of east germans holed up inside the 
compound had reached around 980 refugees reported 
some said theyd had to spend sunday night in the open air for 
lack of red cross tents but new tents arrived during the day 
in the area near the embassy police have towed away all east 
german cars 
the situation is getting ever more difficult said a 
40yearold east german who like all the others asked for 
anonymity 
he said that his wife and children had successfully made it to 
the west via hungary but he himself was intercepted by 
czechoslovak border guards as he drove in his car toward the 
czechoslovakhungarian frontier 
other wouldbe refugees were also caught 
fearing imprisonment at home he told a reporter where else 
should i have gone the bonn embassy was the last way out 
those camping in the embassy garden are mostly people aged 
3040 but there are also 200 children including several infants 
there was hardly any space left to put up new tents 
in warsaw at least 300 east germans are being accommodated 
either in a group of west german embassy houses in the villa 
district of saska kepa or in a parksurrounded former seminary in 
tarchomin just outside warsaw 
the embassy was closed to the public last week to prevent more 
refugees from entering 
the east germans were anxious to be allowed onto embassy grounds 
on monday but guards stood inside the locked gates however 
embassy officers after making an announcement in the afternoon 
could be seen escorting small groups away from the embassy 
presumably to a shelter for the night 
a tall young east german who identified himself as paul 23 
described his escape from his homeland 
he said he blew up an air mattress placed his belongings on it 
and then swam with the mattress across the neisse river that forms 
the polisheast german border in southwest poland

water damage to columbia is less 
than originally thought and the shuttle has a good chance to meet 
its december launch target the director of the kennedy space 
center said tuesday 
it certainly does not have the dimensions of doom we were 
concerned about after fire protection water drenched columbia on 
sunday forrest mccartney said in an interview 
weve not really assessed what the impact will be on the 
launch date but my personal assessment on it right now is that it 
will be minimal if any he said 
sunday we had a very bad day and we had a very gloomy 
outlook but its tuesday morning and while we see some 
additional work to be done we feel that work can be 
accomplished he said 
the accident occurred as three workers were performing routine 
maintenance on the fire sprinkler system in the hangar where 
columbia is being readied for a dec 18 launch the national 
aeronautics and space administration reported a valve in one 
sprinkler head failed causing a leakage of water 
two other workers in their haste to stop the flow 
inadvertantly turned on other sprinklers and several thousand 
gallons of water poured onto work platforms and the shuttle other 
workers were able to shut off the water after several minutes 
im chalking it up to a combination of equipment error and 
human error said thomas utsman deputy director of the space 
center and head of a team investigating the incident 
utsman said monday that as many as 200 of the shuttles 500 
woven fiberglass heat shields might have been damaged by the 
soaking and might have to be replaced 
but mccartney said tuesday the number was closer to 70 or 80 and 
that most of them were off the shuttle sitting to the side on 
racks they had been removed to give technicians access to a series 
of steering jets in the spaceships nose 
mccartney said there had been some concern that damage might 
have occurred to columbias electrical system but when power was 
turned on tuesday morning there were no problems detected 
the system has to be flexible enough to accept these 
disruptions mccartney said i dont want to downplay the 
problem but i think we are professional enough and flexible enough 
to cope with this one 
columbias crew of five is to deploy a communications satellite 
and retrieve for return to earth a scientific payload that has been 
orbiting for more than five years 
two prior shuttle missions are scheduled atlantis is to carry 
the galileojupiter probe into space on oct 12 and discovery is 
being groomed for a nov 19 liftoff with a defense department 
payload

gov rudy perpich said tuesday he is 
asking the us supreme court to review an appellate decision 
upholding a law that stripped governors of their veto power over 
national guard training missions 
congress enacted the law known as the montgomery amendment 
after several governors in 1985 and 1986 objected to deployment of 
national guard personnel on maneuvers in central america where the 
governors felt there was a danger of involvement in wars 
the law presents a states rights issue of historical 
importance perpich said at a news conference because of 
conflicting decisions in the lower courts this issue warrants a 
final resolution by the supreme court 
perpich said he has never disapproved of any federal training 
deployment of the minnesota national guard but is challenging the 
laws constitutionality because it invades on a governors 
authority 
perpich initially challenged the montgomery amendment on jan 
28 1987 the amendment to a 1986 defense bill says governors may 
not withhold their consent to national guard missions because of 
any objection to the location purpose type or schedule of such 
active duty 
the amendment was upheld in us district court but a 
threejudge panel of the 8th us circuit court of appeals ruled it 
was unconstitutional at the request of the us department of 
justice the full 8th circuit considered the matter and on june 
28 it held 72 that the law is constitutional 
minnesotas lawsuit contends the law violates the militia clause 
of the constitution which reserves to states authority to direct 
or consent to peacetime training of the national guard 
a statement issued tuesday by the office of the amendments 
author rep gv montgomery dmiss said the case already has 
been argued exhaustively 
the courts have ruled the amendment to be constitutional 
montgomery said its time now to let the national guard get back 
to the business of training and away from the courtroom it would 
be a terrible mistake to deny our guard personnel the chance to 
train in real world conditions that cant be duplicated at bases in 
the united states 
jack tunheim minnesotas chief deputy attorney general said a 
decision from the supreme court on whether it will hear the case is 
expected in two to three months 
the supreme courts refusal to hear a similar challenge to the 
law filed by massachusetts and rejected by the 1st us circuit 
court of appeals should have no bearing on whether the high court 
considers minnesotas challenge tunheim said 
that case was not nearly as welldeveloped as the minnesota 
case tunheim said the 1st circuit issued a onesentence order 
affirming the law while the decisions in the minnesota case have 
prompted lengthy dissents tunheim said

the populaton of blackfooted ferrets 
once believed extinct is growing in captive breeding and eventually 
the animals will be set free in wyomings high plains 
this week the state game and fish department is holding hearings 
in meeteetse cody and casper to discuss a reintroduction plan that 
could see the first of the small masked mammals released into the 
wild by 1991 
four years ago an epidemic of canine distemper nearly wiped out 
the only known colony of the nocturnal weasellike creatures and 
wildlife biologists trapped the last 18 for a captive breeding 
program 
the program centered at the departments sybille canyon facility 
has boosted the known population of ferrets to some 120 
this weeks hearings will draw public comment on plans to return 
some of the ferrets to the plains surrounding meeteetse where they 
were found in 1981 after being considered extinct 
its only right said town recreation director jim sessions 
who keeps in his office meeteetses only remaining blackfooted 
ferret stuffed 
but some objectives must be met before reintroduction 
scientists are working on a vaccine to immunize the animals 
against distemper said tom thorne a state veterinarian who 
directed the breeding project 
and the ferrets must be taught how to kill prairie dogs their 
natural prey to help the animals learn game and fish has built 
caged outdoor prairie dog colonies 
but theres no fear that captivebred ferrets wont recognize 
predators that can kill them said thorne 
if anything they are wilder and more afraid of us than the 
wildcaught ferrets he said my hope is that theyre going to 
regard everything except prairie dogs as a predator 
critics worry that human activity particularly the areas 
ranching and oil industries will be a bigger problem 
exxon has proposed drilling a well a few miles from prime ferret 
habitat and a public hearing on that proposal is scheduled 
thursday in meeteetse 
but pitchfork ranch manager jack turnell 43 a member of an 
advisory board on the ferret program said he has zero concern 
about drilling 
the ferret doesnt give a damn about people or machinery or 
cattle or anything else said turnell theres only one thing 
they care about thats a food source 
turnell said scientists want him to persuade other ranchers to 
let ferrets be introduced into prairie dog towns on their ranches 
but the ranchers are afraid not of ferrets but of 
bureaucrats and environmentalists because they go overboard with 
their rules and regulations he said 
wildlife officials hope to ease that fear by having the 
reintroduced ferrets declared a nonessential experimental 
population under the endangered species act that would lift 
restrictions that protect every individual of a threatened species 
and reduce bureaucratic reaction to ferret deaths

a survey of almost 400000 junior high and 
high school students nationwide found that the percentage using 
drugs has dropped in the past two years but those who use cocaine 
are getting higher 
im discouraged that the levels of intoxication are 
increasing thomas j gleaton jr president of national 
parents resource institute for drug education said tuesday in 
announcing the survey results 
the percentage of students in grades 912 who said they use 
cocaine dropped from 64 percent in 198687 to 46 percent in the 
198889 school year however those users who reported getting 
very high or bombedstoned from the drug rose from 714 
percent to 745 percent over the twoyear period according to the 
pride survey 
in the junior high grades of 68 17 percent of the students 
said they had used cocaine in the past year a drop from 23 
percent in 198687 but 682 percent of those users said they got 
very high or bombedstoned compared with 652 percent in 
the earlier survey 
the drop in the percentage of students who said they used 
cocaine means the casual user is more careful more frightened of 
the drug gleaton said 
outlining a profile of the student cocaine user gleaton 
described a venturesome and sociable youth who wants to 
be first hes got a wonderful little ego 
although the use of beer liquor marijuana and cocaine showed 
declines from the 198687 survey for students in grades 612 
levels of junior high students use of liquor and cocaine remained 
higher than they were in the 198485 survey 
the percentage of students in grades 68 who said they used 
liquor was 212 percent in 198485 peaked at 263 percent two 
years ago and dropped to 249 percent in the latest survey the 
percentage who said they used cocaine was 13 percent four years 
ago peaked at 23 percent two years ago and dropped to 17 percent 
in the new study 
in addition the latest survey detected weekly cocaine use in 
the sixth grade 
of the 29116 sixth graders who responded to a question about 
cocaine use 08 percent or about 233 said they used cocaine 
weekly or daily about 58 sixth graders said they used cocaine once 
or twice a month and another 87 said they used cocaine one to six 
times a year 
for junior high students of the 161907 who answered the 
cocaine question 07 percent or 1133 said they used it weekly or 
daily an equal number used it infrequently and 648 said they used 
it once or twice a month 
whereas we have seen some drops in drug use at the upper 
grades at the lower grades there is an alarming trend of more 
use compared with four years earlier said doug hall vice 
president of pride 
gleaton said the reduced levels among high schoolers may reflect 
that those who start using drugs early drop out of school and 
therefore were not surveyed 
the survey covered 392003 students in grades 6 to 12 who 
answered an anonymous questionnaire given in 958 schools in 38 
states 
hall said the survey represented a crosssection of the united 
states from inner cities to rural areas but it was not a 
scientific random selection of students 
cigarette smoking gained popularity among all levels of students 
surveyed with 387 percent of high school students and 281 
percent of junior high students saying they had smoked a cigarette 
increases over both two and four years ago 
gleaton said that might be because the public is focusing so 
much now on crack on cocaine on drugs that less attention 
is paid to cigarettes 
the educational level and employment status of parents did not 
differ widely between cocaineusing high school seniors and those 
who abstain the survey found 
in fact the parents of cocaineusing students were slightly 
bettereducated the study said

former hud secretary samuel r pierce today 
refused to answer questions from a house subcommittee investigating 
scandals at the agency during his eightyear tenure citing his 
fifth amendment right against selfincrimination 
pierce appearing before the subcommittee under a subpoena said 
criticism of him by members of the panel leads me to the painful 
conclusion that i have been prejudged by this body 
pierce made the dramatic announcement in a brief opening 
statement to the subcommittee at his insistence television 
cameras and photography equipment were barred during pierces 
appearance 
the subcommittee chairman rep thomas lantos then posed a 
series of eight questions to pierce regarding his tenure at hud 
and each time pierce refused to answer citing his constitutional 
rights 
lantos said pierce may have waived his rights not to answer by 
testifying voluntarily before the same committee in may but lantos 
said he would not rule immediately on that question as chairman and 
told pierces lawyers to submit written arguments on the 
constitutional question within a week 
lantos dcalif also said he would again urge current hud 
secretary jack kemp to cooperate with pierces request under the 
freedom of information act for hud documents 
pierce refused to answer questions from reporters as he left the 
hearing room 
his attorney paul l perito said he hoped pierce would be 
ready to testify on oct 27 the next time the subpoena requires 
him to appear this man is an innocent man perito said this 
man wants very much to tell his story 
among the questions lantos put to pierce were ones about his 
approval over the objection of other hud officials of hud funds 
for an elderly housing project in durham nc 
lantos also asked pierce to explain an announcement by president 
reagan of the awarding of a hud grant for elderly housing in ewing 
nj during a campaign appearance in 1982 on behalf of the 
republican candidate for the us senate millicent fenwick lantos 
questioned how that announcement was consistent with pierces 
previous contention that the housing program was not run on a 
political basis 
lantos ended his questioning saying it is obvious the 
witness is determined to invoke his fifth amendment 
prerogative 
rep donald e buz lukens the ranking republican on the 
panel told pierce i am truly disappointed and frustrated by 
his refusal to testify 
virtually every member of the panel said that they hoped pierce 
would agree to testify but said even before he spoke that they 
expected him to invoke his constitutional right against 
selfincrimination 
pierce was originally scheduled to testify on sept 15 but 
refused to appear saying he had just hired an attorney and was not 
ready the subcommittee then subpoenaed pierce and demanded that he 
appear today 
pierce showed up as scheduled but after being sworn in as a 
witness read a brief statement in which he said he would not answer 
questions because he still had not had enough time to prepare he 
also said he had determined that the committee would not grant him 
a fair hearing 
under these circumstances my counsel has advised me to assert 
my constitutional rights under the fifth and sixth amendments by 
refusing to answer questions he said 
pierces appearance came after an angry exchange between his 
attorneys and lantos perito had objected to having three lawmakers 
who are not members of the subcommittee present at the hearing 
when perito asked that those three be barred from asking 
questions lantos said that under house rules pierces attorneys 
had no right to speak but only to advise pierce 
in this hearing you are in fact a potted plant lantos told 
perito 
that was a reference to the 1987 irancontra hearings when 
oliver norths attorney brendan sullivan forcefully told a 
different investigating committee i am not a potted plant 
during a round of lengthy opening statements lawmakers 
criticized pierce for refusing to appear voluntarily and suggested 
he was reluctant to testify because he had something to hide 
lantos also dismissed pierces contention that he would not be 
treated fairly 
we are not engaged in a punitive mission lantos said 
perito told reporters later however that he still believed the 
subcommittee had a vendetta against pierce what they want to do 
is rush him to judgment they want to try convict and sentence 
him and we will not let that occur perito said 
rep charles schumer dny said that by seeking delays and 
forcing the committee to subpoena him pierce was playing a game 
of legal hide and seek to avoid testifying about problems at the 
agency he headed for the eight years of the reagan administration 
pierce refused to answer questions after insisting that no 
television cameras still photographers or radio reporters be 
allowed to record or photograph his testimony 
house rules allow subpoeaned witnesses to ask for such 
restrictions on media coverage and pierce refused when lantos asked 
him to reconsider the request 
pierce testified in may that he was not a handson manager 
and he also told reporters that some of his aides had apparently 
betrayed him 
since then however several former deputies challenged pierces 
account that he was not directly involved in major funding 
decisions agency records disclosed since then also show a greater 
pierce role in major decisions than he indicated neither the 
testimony nor the records however suggest any wrongdoing by 
pierce

a highly decorated police officer who 
has difficulty reading because of a learning disability has won his 
battle to have someone read him the test he must pass to be 
promoted to sergeant 
officer curt spanos first request for a reader was rejected 
last week p william herndon howard countys assistant personnel 
administrator noted that spanos had passed the written test 
without a reader two years ago and would be given ample time to 
complete it this time 
but monday after spanos challenged the decision with help from 
an advocate for the disabled herndon said a reader would be made 
available for the test sunday 
i feel relieved spanos said i dont know why they made 
me jump through the hoops if i hadnt enlisted the help of an 
advocate i wonder where i would be 
he said the fact that he had passed the test without a reader 
should not have been used as grounds to deny him one now 
spanos 41 a 17year police veteran and the countys most 
decorated officer has dyslexia a disability that makes it 
difficult for him to read and write some words that did not stop 
him from graduating from college 
because of dyslexia he was held back a grade in school and a 
police department supervisor once sent him to class with elementary 
children to improve his reading and writing he said 
i have to memorize words he said there are times when i 
simply dont recall a word and i try to put it in context and 
sometimes i get it wrong also there are times i read a word and 
the letters run together or when i write i leave a letter out 
four years ago he said he narrowly flunked the written part of 
the sergeants test disqualifying him from the promotional list 
two years later he passed the test and other requirements to be 
placed on the qualifying list but the county decided not to fill 
all of the sergeant vacancies because there were no minorities on 
the list the list expires every two years 
i felt disappointed extremely frustrated and angry spanos 
said i think it is worth taking a chance i am not a rookie any 
more if this comes back to haunt me so be it maybe someone else 
will benefit in the future 
spanos enlisted the help of robert ardinger an instructor of 
us government at howard community college who is a member of the 
countys commission on disability issues and a cofounder of the 
advocacy group disabled in action 
ardinger said he was taken aback by the original denial 
it was such a reasonable request for this kind of disability 
there is no question officer spanos is entitled to this 
accommodation he said

country musician russell smith says he 
organized a benefit concert to aid cleanup of the alaskan oil spill 
because he believes exxon has reneged on its promise to restore the 
area 
besides smith other performers slated to appear wednesday at 
nashvilles center stage include rodney crowell jc crowley guy 
clark vince gill maura oconnell jonelle mosser new grass 
revival and alaskas hobo jim 
smith whose new album is titled this little town said 
monday he was moved by the plight of the wildlife and people living 
along the hundreds of miles of shoreline soiled by the spill 
nearly 11 million gallons of oil poured into prince william sound 
after the tanker exxon valdez struck a reef on march 24 
the bodies of more than 30000 birds and about 1000 animals 
have been found biologists say those figures probably represent 
only 5 percent to 10 percent of the deaths caused by the spill 
when i found out about this i became concerned more than 
concerned i became extremely angry about it smith said their 
economy was shot to hell because of this everyone needed money so 
bad fishermen have lost their boats because they missed the 
fishing season 
exxon spent at least 12 billion on the cleanup before stopping 
its efforts earlier this month because of worsening weather and 
dwindling daylight 
alaska gov steve cowper said the state would conduct a 21 
million program to continue cleanup work left by exxon 
exxon has said it will reevaluate the shorelines next spring 
and decide then whether to resume the cleanup on a large scale 
one of the main things we are trying to do is keep this before 
the publics attention to keep pressure on exxon to keep their 
promise and clean it up smith said 
the concert is expected to raise 16000 to 20000 95 percent 
of which will go to the prince william sound cleanup and 
rehabilitation fund administered by the alaska conservation 
foundation only the cost of printing and selling the 
20perperson tickets was not donated smith said 
the money will be used to help wildlife and clean the area the 
alaska conservation foundation is a 10yearold nonprofit group 
that pays for environmental education and policy studies 
rounding up artists for the concert wasnt difficult smith said 
most of the people i have asked are pretty much concerned 
people concerned about the environment period he said

the senate voted overwhelmingly today to back 
a federal commissions decision to shut down 86 military bases and 
scale down five more as lawmakers weighed a 2282 billion military 
spending bill 
by a vote of 8614 the senate approved an amendment that 
effectively kills a provision that would have withheld 300 million 
to close the bases until an audit found that the savings from 
shutting down the installations would exceed the cost 
meanwhile defense secretary dick cheney said that further cuts 
in the defense budget by the democraticcontrolled congress may 
force him to close more bases 
the audit would have been conducted by the general accounting 
office the investigative arm of congress 
were just asking that the comptroller general analyze 
otherwise these bases have no appeal sen daniel inouye 
dhawaii said on the senate floor in support of the amendment 
there is no supreme court this is the supreme court 
but sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the 
senate armed services committee argued against undermining the 
commissions recommendations which were approved by former 
secretary of defense frank c carlucci and upheld in the house 
if we set a precedent now that you can reopen the package 
im fearful future commissions wont be as effective warner said 
the commission in issuing its recommendation last year 
estimated savings of 56 billion over 20 years 
since the commissions announcement last december lawmakers 
whose homestate bases would be affected complained that the panel 
based its selection on inaccurate or incomplete data 
prior to the senate action cheney met on capitol hill with 
lawmakers from illinois who made a lastditch appeal to save 
chanute air force base near rantoul ill the session did not 
change plans to close chanute 120 miles south of chicago 
given all the demands to redirect dollars from the defense 
budget to other areas ive got no choice but to find ways to close 
additional bases cheney told reporters the day after senate 
democrats and the administration reached a tentative agreement to 
boost president bushs antidrug effort by 900 million 
the drug plan requires a cut of about 13 billion in the 
pentagon budget 
on the senate floor sen alan dixon dill criticized the 
recommendations made last year by the faceless nameless members 
of the commission 
they cooked the books dixon said waving a copy of a 
general accounting office report that had found problems in the 
commissions report the gao is an investigative agency of congress 
residents and businesses in several illinois counties and cities 
near chanute pooled their money to hire an influential lobbying 
firm to argue for inouyes measure the cost for hiring patton 
boggs and blow is estimated at about 30000 
the senate also was weighing legislation that cuts president 
bushs request for star wars and the trident 2 missile but leaves 
other strategic programs relatively intact 
among the major provisions of the spending bill are 
a cut of about 800 million from bushs 49 billion proposal 
for the strategic defense initiative in the fiscal year beginning 
oct 1 senate minority leader bob dole of kansas and fellow 
republican sen pete wilson of california plan to introduce an 
amendment to raise the spending level for star wars 
elimination of all 18 billion for procurement of the trident 
2 missile and an increase of 70 million to bushs request of 216 
million for research and development of the submarinelaunched 
weapons the trident 2 missile suffered two successive failures in 
undersea test firings one month before the committee action 
a requirement that 820 million of the 37 billion for star 
wars be used for research on lasers and particle beams sen 
bennett johnston dla sponsor of the amendment expressed 
concerns that the administration will sacrifice longterm research 
on directed energy weapons in favor of a quick deployment along the 
lines of the brilliant pebbles scheme favored by many in the 
administration 
provisions similar to those in an earlier authorization bill 
with most of bushs strategic programs left intact including the 
mx and midgetman nuclear missiles and the b2 stealth bomber the 
spending plan also accepts the presidents decision to cancel the 
navys f14d jet fighter 
earmarking 255 million for the marine corps to test the v22 
osprey a verticaltakeoff plane the administration sought to 
cancel

former hud secretary samuel r pierce jr 
refused to answer questions tuesday from a house panel 
investigating housing scandals citing his constitutional right 
against selfincrimination he contended he had been prejudged by 
this body 
pierce compelled to appear by a subpoena accused the 
subcommittee of trying to rush him into testifying without adequate 
preparation and said he hoped to tell his story later 
his refusal to testify came at a dramatic meeting of a panel 
that has been investigating allegations of billions of dollars 
worth of fraud mismanagement influence peddling and political 
favoritism at the department of housing and urban development 
which pierce headed throughout the reagan administration 
disagreements between the subcommittee and pierce even extended 
to news coverage of the hearing pierce invoked house rules that 
forced subcommittee chairman tom lantos dcalif to bar 
television radio and photographic coverage despite the chairmans 
complaint that the move was unwarranted 
pierce read a brief statement saying he had not had time to 
prepare did not have the hud documents he needed and would invoke 
his constitutional right not to testify 
lantos then posed eight questions to pierce some raising new 
suggestions of political influence involving hud and the reagan 
white house 
each time pierce refused to answer 
the subcommittees desire to rush me through this process 
together with various statements made by members leads me to 
the painful conclusion that i have been prejudged by this body 
pierce said 
under these circumstances my counsel has advised me and i 
have agreed to assert my constitutional rights under the fifth and 
sixth amendments by refusing to answer questions before this 
subcommittee he said i trust this subcommittee will remember 
that these rights are intended as shields for the innocent and that 
they do not create any inference or presumption of wrongdoing 
paul l perito his attorney said he hoped pierce would be 
ready to testify on oct 27 the next date he has been ordered 
before the employment and housing subcommittee of the house 
government operations committee 
but perito outside the committee room told reporters the 
subcommittee wanted wouldnt give pierce a fair hearing and wanted 
to rush him to judgment 
they want to try convict and sentence him and we will not 
let that occur perito said this man is an innocent man 
this man wants very much to tell his story 
perito and lantos engaged in a brief but heated exchange after 
the lawyer attempted to challenge the presence of three lawmakers 
who are not members of the subcommittee 
lantos said that under house rules pierces attorneys had no 
right to speak but only to advise their client 
in this hearing you are in fact a potted plant lantos told 
perito a remark that recalled the 1987 irancontra hearings when 
oliver norths attorney brendan sullivan told a different 
investigating committee i am not a potted plant something to 
be ignored 
pierce himself cited public comments about a need for a special 
prosecutor as well as comments by panel members alleging 
inconsistencies in his voluntary testimony last may as evidence he 
had been prejudged 
however rep charles schumer dny said pierce had thrown 
roadblocks in the way of the truth coming out the longer he 
does it the more he digs himself into a hole 
a republican on the subcommittee rep christopher shays of 
connecticut said before the hearing that if pierce refused to 
testify he would support calling for the justice department to 
appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the former secretary 
lantos said after the meeting he was studying the issue 
pierce delivered the same response to each of the eight 
questions posed to him a brief sentence citing his rights and his 
attorneys advice he sat expressionless facing the panel as 
members criticized his refusal to testify he occasionally closed 
his eyes and shook his head slightly 
lantos said pierce may have waived his rights not to answer by 
testifying voluntarily before the same subcommittee in may lantos 
told pierces lawyers to submit written arguments on the question 
within a week 
among the questions lantos put to pierce were ones about his 
approval over the objection of other hud officials of money for a 
housing project for elderly people in durham nc 
lantos also asked pierce to explain an announcement by 
thenpresident reagan of the awarding of a hud grant for housing 
for the elderly during a new jersey campaign appearance in 1982 on 
behalf of the republican candidate for the us senate millicent 
fenwick 
the congressman questioned how that announcement was consistent 
with pierces statement in his may testimony that the housing 
program was not run on a political basis 
i cant see how it could be any more political lantos said 
lantos showed copies of a sept 17 1982 memo in which pierce 
was informed by a deputy that the president who is en route to 
new jersey has agreed to fund with section 8 new construction 
funds the 125unit housing project for ewing nj 
the subcommittee chairman said the new jersey units were taken 
away from the durham project which was later financed anyway 
the memo bears pierces initials and the handwritten word 
noted 
lantos also showed a report on reagans appearance the following 
day in the trenton times newspaper the account said the projects 
developer didnt know hud had approved the project until seeing it 
on an evening news program and it quoted reagan as saying after 
his announcement if you dont elect her as senator well take it 
away

police are guarding public buildings 
following a weeklong series of suspicious fires and telephone 
threats against schools and school officials 
this might be related to our attempt to break up a drug 
pipeline at the school earlier this year said school 
superintendent george french there was an attempt by drug 
dealers to get a foothold in it and weve worked very hard to 
eliminate drugs he said 
french also speculated the fires could be reprisals against 
administrators for the expulsion of a guntoting 14yearold male 
student several weeks ago 
we had a student expelled because he brought his fathers gun 
to school with the intent to kill another student he said he 
declined to identify the minor 
french said the student fired one shot that hit a portable 
classroom 
the consensus is that the fires are all connected said 
state chief deputy fire marshal john chamblee of jackson 
its giving us indications that someone has a vendetta or a 
loose screw he said of the investigation adding that his office 
will post a 1000 reward 
monday morning someone pushed a burning wad of paper behind a 
ceiling tile at the countys temporary welfare office downtown the 
fire did little damage and was being investigated as arson said 
hazlehurst public safety director thomas quarles 
another fire early sunday gutted a vacant building being rented 
by woodrow purcer a candidate in a special election for 
supervisor quarles said 
quarles said the fire is believed to be also arsonrelated 
purcer said it had nothing to do with the election it just 
happened 
four fires set at hazlehurst elementary school and hazlehurst 
high school early thursday and a fire that demolished the copiah 
county welfare office early friday were under investigation as 
arson police said authorities said there are no suspects 
french said he received a series of telephone threats sunday 
night from a woman who threatened to destroy the schools and 
kill him 
this is the first time that i have confirmed that this is a 
vendetta french said adding that he believes the threats and 
fires are the result of a grudge against the school administration 
in the second call they said for me to meet them somewhere 
and they were going to kill me nothing but me he said and 
in the third call they said they were going to kill me and just 
hung up 
a bomb squad combed the campuses and the athletic field for 
explosives before a home football game on friday french said 
french said authorities are working around the clock to protect 
the campuses and quarles said city and county law officers are 
guarding public buildings from dusk to dawn

relatives rushed across the border from 
cambodia on tuesday to greet their sons fathers and husbands 
returning from vietnams nearly 11yearold war in the neighboring 
country 
vietnam said the withdrawal marked the end of its military 
involvement in cambodia but guerrillas claim thousands of 
vietnamese soldiers remain wearing cambodian uniforms 
schoolchildren peasants and city dwellers lined highway 1 
waving flags and tree branches at the thousands of passing troops 
in a governmentorchestrated welcoming ceremony 
my wife is more beautiful now than ever one soldier said as 
he held hands with his spouse who dashed the last few yards to 
embrace her husband 
vietnam had promised it would have all of its 26000 troops out 
of cambodia by sept 26 and the withdrawal sparked fears that 
cambodia will slide into protracted civil war as government troops 
try to fight the threeparty guerrilla coalition without vietnamese 
help 
vietnams invasion in december 1978 ousted the khmer rouge 
regime which had ruled cambodia since 1975 during that time the 
khmer rouge killed hundreds of thousands practicing a radical 
brand of agrarian communism now the khmer rouge is the strongest 
of the threeparty guerrilla front 
guerrilla radio reports monitored in bangkok on tuesday claimed 
resistance forces had seized two more areas in a gemrich region in 
western cambodia killing some vietnamese troops in the fighting 
cambodian defense minister tea banh recently confirmed that 
guerrillas held some areas near pailin 
at moc bai a vietnamese cultural troop serenaded hundreds of 
soldiers with popular tunes as they sat in a footballfield size 
buffer zone between the two countries several military officers 
gave patriotic speeches praising the solidarity of the 
vietnamese and cambodian peoples 
then with the whine of a motorcycle siren the convoy began 
led by an americanmade jeep and sovietmade armored personnel 
carriers the soldiers scurried into trucks and roared home 
followed by trucks of their comrades 
i am so happy to be leaving cambodia a soldier from can tho 
province said as his 3yearold daughter tugged at his hair 
many men said they were worried that after receiving a heros 
welcome they will have trouble finding jobs hanoi has demobilized 
more than a halfmillion soldiers in recent years gen tran cong 
man editor of vietnams official army newspaper said in a recent 
interview with the associated press unemployment is also high 
freshly painted posters praising vietnams army lined highway 1 
the narrow potholed highway was one of the main invasion routes 
used by vietnamese troops almost 11 years ago when they poured into 
cambodia 
in addition to the 10000 troops at moc bai vietnamese soldiers 
crossed over at port towns on the mekong river and at several other 
locations overland logistics and artillery divisions along with 
wounded soldiers crossed the border at samat several miles north 
of moc bai tanks and armored personnel carriers arrived at the 
port town of rach gai 
outside of moc bai the convoy stopped and started as local 
villagers crowded around the trucks to cheer the soldiers 
at go dau a toothless farmer ran to one truck and tossed the 
soldiers packets of rice and pork wrapped in banana leaves 
thank you grandfather one soldier said many of the troops 
had spent the night on highway 1 sleeping under trucks 
staterun television tuesday night devoted a lengthy program to 
the pullout as did the newspaper of the vietnamese communist party 
in an editorial the paper said vietnams special relationship 
with cambodia would continue cambodian resistance groups have 
claimed vietnam wants to colonize cambodia 
in ho chi minh city vietnamese government officials confirmed 
that vietnam and cambodia would renegotiate their treaty of peace 
and friendship imposed on the cambodian government soon after it 
was installed in phnom penh 
the treaty which is basically a mutual defense pact conflicts 
with cambodias stated goal of neutrality cambodian prime minister 
hun sen had earlier said he hoped the treaty would be renegotiated 
soon 
however the officials said such renegotiation would not affect 
vietnamese military support of the phnom penh government they said 
such support through arms transfers advice and intelligence 
would last as long as nations such as china and thailand continue 
to support the guerrilla resistance front the soviet union is 
cambodias main arms supplier

the senate finance committee found no 
agreement tuesday on a new plan to prevent repeal of catastrophic 
medical insurance for retirees 
there obviously is not bipartisan support for any proposal at 
this point committee chairman sen lloyd bentsen dtexas told 
reporters after a closed session 
the administration says it is for the new package but i 
dont see any republican members for the package he said 
sen david durenberger rminn said he saw signs members might 
be drawing closer to a compromise bentsen he said is swimming 
uphill and he ought to have republicans he ought to have the 
president in the boat with him 
the yearold program designed to prevent a serious illness from 
financially ruining retirees is under attack from many older 
americans 
some object because they already have catastrophic coverage and 
some higherincome retirees are upset because they must pay a large 
share of the programs cost 
the house ways and means committee has agreed to shift more of 
the cost to those with lower incomes allow retirees to drop 
coverage if they also give up medicare part b physicians fees 
and to scale back reimbursement for prescriptions 
there are indications the house may vote instead to repeal the 
program 
the latest proposal considered by the finance committee would 
cut the 800 maximum annual surtax paid by higherincome retirees 
to 400 slow scheduled increases in the 4amonth flat fee for 
catastrophic coverage that most retirees pay permit beneficiaries 
to drop catastrophic protection if they also give up medicare part 
b require retirees to pay more of physicians fees before the new 
protection kicks in and eliminate coverage for most prescription 
drugs 
another element being considered by the panel would pay some 
costs of the program by requiring that all state and local 
government employees pay the share of social security taxes that 
finances medicare 
present law requires that state and local employees hired on or 
after april 1 1986 pay the medicare tax which this year is 145 
percent of the first 48000 of annual earnings 
about 3 million employees would face the tax increase under the 
finance committee proposal

just as american television viewers are 
beginning a new season of jr ewing intrigues and angela channing 
plots their fans here are suffering the pain of soap opera 
withdrawal 
its a hard comedown for viewers who for the past few months 
have enjoyed an almost nonstop run of dallas dynasty 
knots landing and falcon crest 
channel 55 bahrains governmentrun englishlanguage television 
network presents the shows nightly instead of once a week as in 
the united states this means an entire seasons 30 installments 
are shown in one month 
hamad almutlak director of foreign programming said this has 
enabled the network to catch up with the series in the states 
whereas they previously lagged as much as two seasons behind 
falcon crest ended this month with angela channings claim 
on the tuscany valley vineyard again in doubt and her son richard 
headed for jail because the shows must be sent off for subtitling 
in arabic it will be sometime next summer before local viewers 
find out what happens next 
while dedicated fans may look in vain for acceptable 
substitutes the end of the american soaps does not mean television 
in this desert region has become a wasteland 
the tv fare in the persian gulf in fact might be considered 
couch potato heaven with perhaps more to choose from than in most 
countries including the united states 
top documentaries and educational programs from american 
public televisions smithsonian world to britains all the 
worlds a stage run in prime time along with bbc shakespearan 
dramas sixty minutes sitcoms cop shows wildlife programs 
movies and miniseries from the united states britain canada and 
australia 
foreign tv addicts might find the periodic prayer 
intermissions on gulf networks a bit disruptive and they might 
be annoyed by the odd transitions that result from moslem censors 
excising scenes of kissing and what one local tv producer called 
the passionate stuff between the sheets 
on the other hand theres hardly more than a hint of 
advertising 
ads on bahrain tv run in twominute commercial breaks once or 
twice an evening 
viewers here may also watch tv from qatar dubai saudi arabia 
even from iran depending on their antennae and the regions 
freakish atmospheric conditions 
the other arabic countries also have a wide range of programming 
for foreign as well as local viewers 
saudi arabias aramco station which basically serves the oil 
companys foreign employees brings top sports events from abroad 
it is currently showing this years national basketball association 
finals 
the saudi channels offer news in arabic english and french and 
last week gave their late night audiences the videotaped 
confessions with english voiceover of 16 kuwaitis convicted of 
terrorist bombings in mecca just hours after they were all 
beheaded 
americans make up a relatively small segment of the foreign 
audience but since dallas was first shown here in 1975 the 
us soaps with their fastpaced plots and lively characters in 
luxurious settings are the most popular programs mutlak said 
by contrast one local tv critic complained of being bored by 
the australian soap sons and daughters because all the action 
seems to take place in somebodys kitchen mutlak said many 
viewers agreed and it wont be renewed 
when on the tube the american soaps are even bad news for 
bahrains video shops accounting for a 25 percent drop in 
rentals according to ahmed rashid manager of a local video 
distributor 
he said that after watching knots landing or falcon 
crest from 9 to 10 pm people are too tired to watch a 
video

communist party leader jiang zemin took a hard 
line tuesday at his first news conference insisting that those 
arrested in the spring democracy movement were criminals and 
refusing to rule out more executions 
asked by a reporter if the tiananmen tragedy could have been 
avoided jiang said we believe it was not a tragedy 
tiananmen was a counterrevolutionary rebellion opposing the 
communist party leaders and seeking to overthrow the socialist 
system he said 
premier li peng who also took part in the news conference 
reaffirmed the partys determination to end rampant corruption and 
said new limits on official perks would be announced in a few days 
the 62yearold jiang whose highest previous post was head of 
the shanghai party committee was catapulted into the national 
leadership in june after soldiers retook beijings tiananmen square 
by force from studentled prodemocracy protesters killing 
hundreds and possibly thousands of people en route to the square 
his predecessor zhao ziyang was accused of supporting the 
protests and ousted 
jiang took a mild tone toward zhao on tuesday saying he was 
leading a comfortable life and receiving full salary he said 
zhao was still under investigation but did not suggest he might 
face further punishment or be put on trial 
the unusual news conference for both local and foreign 
reporters appeared intended to demonstrate the solidity of the new 
party leadership in time for the 40th anniversary of the founding 
of communist china on oct 1 
when zhao took office in 1987 he was the first party leader to 
hold a news conference with foreign reporters in more than a decade 
but while zhao shook hands and joked with the reporters jiang 
sat behind a table in the great hall of the people and answered 
most questions with wellworn phrases from official speeches and 
editorials 
he appeared relaxed however and ventured a few personal 
remarks complimenting two young taiwanese reporters on their 
mandarin chinese mandarin is the official language of both the 
mainland and taiwan but many older chinese speak regional dialects 
in an apparent effort to emphasize a collective leadership 
jiang was joined by li and the four other members of the politburo 
standing committee the partys top body each answered at least 
one question 
song ping in charge of party organization and yao yilin in 
charge of economic planning read their answers indicating the 
questions they were asked were arranged in advance 
the leaders comments held no surprises reiterating the party 
emphasis since june on opposing western bourgeois influences 
and promoting traditional socialist values 
jiang said the party was understanding toward most students and 
others who took part in the massive prodemocracy marches of the 
spring and would seek to unify and educate them 
the youth are the hope of the future he said we are full 
of warmth toward thembut there is no denying that there have 
been some conspirators who acted with ulterior motives to overthrow 
the communist party and the government they have violated chinese 
law 
asked if he could rule out that dissidents who advocated 
nonviolence such as student leader wang dan would be executed 
jiang said it was up to the courts to decide 
we cannot substitute the party for the government or for the 
judicial system he said 
at least 12 executions have been reported of people clearly 
accused of taking part in the prodemocracy protests in some form 
jiang confirmed that the partys central committee its main 
policymaking body soon will hold its first plenary meeting since 
june but said no date has been set he said the committee will 
discuss economic problems 
he did not say if the retirement of senior leader deng xiaoping 
will also be discussed deng 85 stepped down from most of his 
official posts in 1987 and has suggested several times that he 
also resign as chairman of the state and party military 
commissions jiang said 
but much is at stake so it still depends on the decision of 
the party and the state to decide the appropriate time at which 
comrade deng xiaoping can retire and the person who might succeed 
him jiang said 
several top officials including jiang president yang shangkun 
and defense minister qin jiwei are reportedly vying for dengs 
posts 
dengs actual power as key policymaker far exceeds the scope of 
his military posts however and he is likely to continue as 
chinas supreme leader even if he resigns from them 
jiang said some have pointed out that the last two party chiefs 
zhao and hu yaobang both lost their posts in disgrace for 
failing to take a stand against liberalism but he declined to 
assess his chances for staying in office

the rural roads of illinois are a world away 
from the shiny floors of the capitol but folks who want to save a 
military base understand one thing about washington clout can 
carry a price 
so they went after some but lost a vote in the senate anyway 
residents of champaign county population 150000 hired an 
influential lobbying firm patton boggs and blow to help them 
as senators considered a 288 billion defense bill 
they hoped the senate would retain a provision in the giant 
defense bill ordering an audit of the costs of closing the bases 
but the provision was defeated today 8614 
the version of the 1990 defense bill approved by the 
appropriations committee said no base could be closed unless an 
audit found that the costs of dismantling it would be recovered 
within six years 
the county and the cities of champaign and rantoul chipped in 
30000 and readers responding to a fullpage advertisement in the 
local newspaper also sent contributions businesses aware of 
chanute air force bases impact on the areas fragile economy 
joined the effort too 
the role of our lobbyists is to do whatever they can that is 
fair and appropriate to turn this thing around says carl 
webber an attorney and chairman of the urbana chamber of commerce 
when you consider the unfairness of the decision and include 
with that the phenomenal impact on this whole area the amount 
were spending on lobbyists is a drop in a bucket said webber 
were not ever going to say die 
the decision to hire a lobbyist has sparked something of a 
debate among lawmakers who represent the area 
sen alan dixon dill said he doubted it would make much 
difference 
sen paul simon dill seeking reelection said the chanute 
forces need all the help they can get adding i wish we lived in 
a pure society where no one would have to hire lobbyists there is 
no question a lobbyist can do some good 
some in congress however wondered if it was too late 
we are just concerned with the ability of paid lobbyists to 
turn a bad situation around in the bottom of the ninth inning 
said david almy spokesman for rep edward madigan rill whose 
district includes chanute as paid advocates of our constituents 
we dont want to see them getting less than their moneys worth 
madigan favors saving the base 
lobbyist tom boggs son of rep lindy boggs dla did not 
return phone calls requesting comment on the lobbying effort 
chanute afb about 120 miles south of chicago has about 8500 
military and civilian personnel and provides training in such 
fields as firefighting and aircraft and missile maintenance 
last december when an independent commission said the 
government should close 86 bases and realign 59 others chanute was 
on the list cited for a shortage of buildings and recreational 
facilities and inadequate housing 
the conclusion by the commission on base closing and realignment 
stunned many lawmakers especially madigan who said the government 
had spent 150 million on new buildings there during the last seven 
years 
chanute defenders claim the commission made glaring errors a 
university study said closing the base could devastate the area 
hiring those lobbyists doesnt do anything more dixon said 
everything they talked to me about ive done 
but dixon added the firm is a good one when youre 
fighting for your life you do everything you can do if you live 
in the city of rantoul and you have a business this is a serious 
thing

tourist city of cartagena today after another bomb blast blamed on 
drug traffickers killed two people and injured one at a hilton 
hotel 
the newspaper el tiempo said a medellin judge on monday dropped 
charges against pablo emilio escobar gaviria and jose gonzalo 
rodriguez gacha alleged leaders of the medellinbased drug 
operation that supplies most of the cocaine in the united states 
the two men are on the us justice department list of 12 key 
drug figures wanted for prosecution in the united states 
the president of colombias house of representatives norberto 
morales said last week that the two men contacted him and said 
they would be willing to move their drug operations out of colombia 
in return for an end to the governments crackdown on trafficking 
escobar and rodriguez had been charged with complicity in the 
kidnapping last year of andres pastrana who was a candidate for 
mayor of bogota pastrana was freed in an army raid and went on to 
be elected mayor of the capital 
escobar and rodriguez also were charged with planning the 
assassination of colombias attorney general carlos hoyos on jan 
25 in medellin 
el tiempo said judge francisco cardenas cited lack of evidence 
in dropping the charges against the two men none of the reputed 
leaders of colombias drug operations has ever been prosecuted 
the dropping of charges has no effect on us extradition orders 
also today a cabinet minister was to meet with representatives 
of the countrys 4600 judges in an effort to head off a strike 
protesting what the judges call inadequate government protection 
from drug gangs 
meanwhile a guerrilla group that is about to sign a peace 
agreement with the government of president virgilio barco said drug 
traffickers should be pardoned daily newspapers reported 
the april 19 movement known as m19 reportedly issued a 
communique at its base camp saying peace talks should be expanded 
to include the drug traffickers 
the traffickers declared war on the colombian government after 
the government launched a crackdown following the assassination of 
a leading presidential candidate luis carlos galan on aug 18 
the guerrilla communique was signed by the rebel groups chiefs 
of staff carlos pizarro leongomez antonio navarro wolf otty 
patino and german rojas nino the newspapers el espectador and el 
tiempo said 
the signing of a peace agreement by the guerrillas and the 
government has been postponed each of the last two days due to 
lastminute changes in the agreement pardoning the traffickers is 
not one of the guerillas demands the newspapers said 
the news conference was held at the guerrilla base camp in the 
tiny village of santo domingo in the andes mountains in southwest 
colombia 
the april 19 movement takes its name after the date of a 1970 
presidential election that dissidents said was fraudulent 
the group seized colombias justice palace in bogota in 1985 
ninetyfive people were killed most in an army assault that ended 
the takeover 
there are six guerrilla groups in colombia with an estimated 
10000 combatants the government is not negotiating with any other 
guerrilla group

parliament on tuesday adopted liberal 
laws that guarantee the rights of hungarians to travel abroad and 
even to emigrate 
the session that opened tuesday is to decide a series of key 
bills designed to pave the way for next years elections the first 
in more than 40 years that will be freely contested by more than 
one party 
the volume of legislation led deputies to vote for extending the 
session past friday when it had been set to end 
the house also was to review changes in the penal code this week 
but postponed until oct 17 discussion of other key bills 
including a law on the functioning of political parties an 
electoral law and constitutional changes that will remove 
references to the leading role of the communist party 
the communists have committed themselves to multiparty elections 
and have pledged to go into opposition if they lose 
more than 70 percent of the 387 parliament deputies are 
communist party members 
in the past hungarys parliament met four times a year for less 
than a week essentially rubberstamping the communist governments 
policies 
in recent months however independents and some reformminded 
communist members of parliament have sparked considerable debate 
and even forced revisions on some key legislation 
the new laws adopted tuesday lift most restrictions on travel 
meaning that hungarians no longer need to seek permission from 
authorities for foreign travel or emigration and that hungarians 
who emigrated even those who were forced to because of their 
political views may return at any time 
the laws take effect jan 1 
interior minister istvan horvath told a news confernce after the 
bills were adopted that freedom of movement is no longer 
dependent on the arbitrariness of the authorities 
he said the new bills were in line with the universal 
declaration of human rights 
hungarys emerging liberal policies were demonstrated by the 
governments decision to remove the barbed wire and other obstacles 
along its western border with austria and to allow thousands of 
east germans seeking to emigrate to the west to cross legally into 
austria 
the decision this month to let the east germans go has deeply 
angered hungarys hardline east bloc allies 
also tuesday four opposition members became the first freely 
elected noncommunists to take their seats in the house since the 
communists consolidated power in 1948 they won a majority vote in 
recent freely contested byelections 
never in the past 42 years was being an mp such an honor 
said gabor roszik one of the oposition members 
we can all be proud regardless of how we got here to be able 
to participate in this transition he said 
roszik who was accompanied to the session by a group of 
supporters waving hungarian flags said the participation of the 
four opposition members marked one of the most significant steps 
of the revolution under way in hungary as we move from dictatorial 
socialism to democracy 
the fall session of parliament was marked by another first an 
electronic voting system was installed to ensure an accurate count 
in the past voting was conducted by a show of hands often 
leading to discrepancies and calls for recounts

vandals damaged the remains of a 13thcentury 
carmelite monastery in northern israel apparently to protest a 
controversial carmelite convent near the auschwitz death camp in 
poland an official said tuesday 
shalom yankelevitch commissioner of antiquities for the city of 
haifa said the vandalism followed reports that jewish religious 
extremists had threatened carmelite nuns carrying out an 
archaeological dig at the monastery 
the vandalism was discovered last week 
sister damien a carmelite nun from salt lake city who is 
leading the dig told israel television her order has always 
opposed having nuns pray at the roman catholic convent on the edge 
of auschwitz 
so for people to hurt our ruins here to try to make the 
sisters come out they are hurting the people who are trying to get 
the nuns out she said jewish leaders say the convent with 
its 12foothigh cross is offensive because of the presence of 
christian symbols at a place where 25 million jews were killed by 
the nazis in world war ii 
yankelevitch said the damage to the convent near haifa came 
after an article appeared in a local newspaper saying anonymous 
religious groups demanded the nuns delay their dig until the 
convent at auschwitz is moved 
the vandals caused extensive damage yankelevitch said 
they toppled the entrance arch into thecathedral and the 
arch leading to the 2nd floor of a sideyard and stone steps all 
this from the 13th century was damaged and broken he said 
a group of american archaelogists has been excavating for two 
years at the oneacre site on biblical mount carmel 
the dig has uncovered new parts of the wellpreserved carmelite 
cathedral and a fortress and ancient water system that are part of 
an entire monastery complex 
the carmelite nuns are trying to prove that the site dates back 
to the 5th century which would predate by 100 years any other 
christain order on mount carmel 
mount carmel is the spiritual center of carmelites throughout 
the world and carmelites here have written letters to israeli 
newspapers calling for moving the convent from auschwitz some have 
traveled to auschwitz to press for transferring the nuns 
yankelevitch said he believed there was a connection between the 
vandalism and threats by religious groups but he did not rule out 
other possibilities the investigation is in police hands he said 
the damage was reported as the controversy over the convent in 
auschwitz seemed to be easing pope john paul ii said last week 
that he believed the nuns should be moved to an interfaith prayer 
center to be built in accordance with a 1987 agreement between 
jewish and catholic officials 
the statement overcame opposition by polish primate jozef glemp 
and polish catholics who have argued the nuns should be allowed to 
remain because they cause no harm and because many christians also 
were killed at auschwitz 
in the netherlands a dutch catholic university on tuesday 
canceled an invitation to glemp citing what it called his 
harrowing antijewish statements 
the catholic university in nijmegen in the eastern netherlands 
said the university board is aware of cardinal glemps 
statements on the jews and the jewish people and distances 
itself emphatically from those statements 
in an aug 26 sermon glemp accused jews of provoking 
antisemitism in poland and of speaking to the poles as a nation 
elevated over all others

when john ring showed up at his corner grocery 
singing im just wild about harry in praise of his favorite 
cat it marked his chief contact with the world for the day his 
brother vincent was never seen at all 
it was only when their equally reclusive sister marie died 
last week that the brothers were delivered from a life in a filthy 
home without running water or electricity but now they face an 
uncertain future 
said matthew ryan a neighbor since the rings moved to the 
workingclass boston neighborhood in the 1950s i couldnt 
believe it who could get by today without electricity and gas and 
water i would have helped them but they werent people who 
wanted you to get involved 
gerri abban the cashier at nearby bells market says the 
plight of the rings was obvious but the best way to help them was 
not 
the markets owner since 1956 matthew cohen gave john 
discounts and looked the other way when one of his checks bounced 
but the rings would not let anyone in the house and social workers 
and priests responded to ms abbans pleas for help by noting that 
the family had a right to privacy 
i sold them charcoal in the winter so they could heat the 
house ms abban said i sold them rubbing alcohol five 
bottles at a time so they could cook i sold them bottle after 
bottle of anacin because theyd get wicked headaches from the smell 
in the house paper plates paper cups bottled water it was 
unbelievable 
the isolation ended last week when john 59 called police to 
report that his 58yearold sisters pulse was weak police said 
they arrived to find her dead and john and 62yearold vincent in 
poor mental condition 
the brothers refused to leave the house though it reeked of 
waste from the rings and their two dozen cats they were sent to 
boston city hospital for evaluation and a hospital spokeswoman 
would say only that they were in stable condition 
in an interview published tuesday john ring said neither he 
his brother nor his sister had worked since the 1950s or early 
60s choosing instead to live with their parents who died more 
than a decade ago 
the cats took all our money cost us 60 a week worth of 
cat food thats why we couldnt fix the place up ring said 
but were going to now 
asked why he didnt accept help ring said i didnt want to 
bother anybody but pretty soon vincent and i will be well again 
and well go back and fix the house up im sure that everything 
will be fine as soon as we get out of the hospital 
city officials say however that the house is in such bad shape 
it has been condemned and the animal rescue league came for the 
cats 
cohen proprietor of bells since 1956 said the rings didnt 
have much but they received some sort of veterans assistance and 
werent penniless they paid with personal checks that occasionally 
bounced and cohen gave them unofficial discounts 
im not saying how many checks bounced cohen said 
lets just say ive got a few in my file 
if john didnt take his medication he went wild cohen 
said when hed come down to the store to buy hed stuff his 
pockets hed throw things around and yell at people we understood 
him we did the best we could we got him home 
neighbors said john and his sister went to church each sunday 
cohen recalled marie as a very fine lady always wellspoken she 
seemed to be wellread and her whole life was taking care of her 
two brothers its a mystery to me why but she did it 
as for the other brother i dont know anything about 
vincent cohen said i saw the man once in a flashing instant 
when i went to the house john ring said his brother had been 
wounded in world war ii 
cohen gave up trying to understand why the rings lived the way 
they did you had a good daddy i had a good daddy he said 
we cant all be lucky 
everybody has a right to their privacy it was my business and 
it wasnt my business i sent a plumber up there i sent an 
electrician and they couldnt get in 
ryan a retired union leader said that he thought vincent had 
died back in the early 1970s then some years ago a fire broke out 
on the street and he saw a man with a beard down to his belt and a 
blanket around him 
i said who is that and someone said thats vincent i 
never believed there was a third person in there

three couples have been declared winners in 
the first annual great american kissoff but their lips are sealed 
about what theyll take home for their efforts 
the six contestants agreed to divvy up the 10000 top prize 
after smooching for 42 days then hiring a lawyer to legally unlock 
their lips 
im just glad its over fernando gonzales said tuesday one 
day after all parties embraced the pact 
he and his wife karen were declared the official firstplace 
finishers after they and two other couples outlasted 11 other pairs 
who entered the contest sponsored by a furniture company the 
company agreed to let the three top couples split the 10000 as 
they pleased and without revealing how 
we thought it was going to be a twoweek thing but it turned 
into a marathon said gonzales im recovered now but it still 
feels like im kissing its like when youve been wearing a 
hat for four or five weeks and then take it off the hat still 
feels like its on 
but gonzales 39 said he still kissed his 36yearold wife and 
mother of their five children good night 
im not tired of kissing her he said i think everyone 
decided we should be the winners because they realized we could go 
on the longest 
gonzales who is unemployed said he survived financially 
because he owned a tile fitting business in california before 
moving to fernley nev in 1985 
reno attorney pat cashill said he was hired by parents of the 
other two couples in their late teens and early 20s to help end the 
contest so their children could get on with their lives 
these people were really caught up in a horrible situation 
cashill said it was like they were in bondage they wouldnt 
quit 10000 is a lot of money 
under the agreement the gonzales couple got the deed to an 
idaho timeshare condominium which was the firstplace prize along 
with the money 
the declared secondplace finishers and winners of an 
expensespaid trip to mexico were lloyd and laura gubler of reno 
bret watson and lori block of reno claimed the thirdplace prize of 
new living room furniture 
the pact to end the kissoff began developing friday and the 
contest was suspended pending the outcome of negotiations 
butch lynn a publicist for the kissoff said the furniture 
company was a bit disappointed in the outcome of the contest 
it was fairly anticlimactic lynn said we were hoping 
there would be a big winner and a ceremony with champagne to hand 
out the 10000 check 
gubler expects to go back to his fathers auto body shop while 
watson will resume his career as a financial planner and ms block 
will look for a new job having lost hers at a bank lynn said 
contest organizers thought the competition would last only about 
two weeks but relatively easy rules allowed the contest to 
continue 
couples had to kiss for 12 hours each day from 9 am to 9 
pm in the furniture stores parking lot with fiveminute breaks 
each hour on aug 26 three competing couples including the 
gublers married in a triple wedding ceremony

urging closer scrutiny of third world defense 
budgets world bank president barber conable said tuesday poor 
countries spent more on the military than on health and education 
combined at times during the past decade 
but let us hope that in the changing political climate of the 
1990s resources are increasingly allocated to more productive 
purposes he said in an address prepared for the banks annual 
meeting 
as a whole low income countries currently spend around 20 
percent of their funds on defense conable said despite cuts in 
other necessities the 200 billion which the developing world 
spends annually on the military has largely been protected he 
said 
the united states spent about 290 billion on the military in 
fiscal year 1989 or about 29 percent of the national budget 
conable said its time for developing countries on one side 
and their arms suppliers on the other to adapt to a world 
where budgets are tight 
it is important to place military spending on the same footing 
as other fiscal decisions to examine possible tradeoffs more 
systematically and to explore ways to bring military spending into 
better balance with development priorities he said 
every country has the right and duty to defend itself and in 
evaluating military expenditures governments should be realistic 
but they also should remember the human consequences of these 
choices said conable who as a former us congressman had some 
experience with gunsvsbutter tradeoffs 
military spending is a sensitive component of the fiscal 
problem that can no longer be neglected conable said because 
arms are often a prime source of external debt accounting for a 
third or more of the interest due by some major third world 
debtridden countries

the worlds written heritage is turning to dust 
with alarming speed and newer books are among the first to crumble 
said specialists gathered tuesday to discuss book preservation 
sixteen million volumes and manuscripts in the library of 
congress will require treatment to prevent total deterioration 
said preservationist dick miller twoandahalf million books in 
the new york public library system turn to dust every year 
miller and other preservationists are members of a library task 
for the committee on institutional cooperation an organization of 
midwestern universities and libraries the task force began meeting 
monday to consider various preservation techniques 
miller book preservation director for akzo chemicals inc in 
chicago wants to seal books in a gas chamber while richard d 
smith of wei to associates inc in matteson ill wants to douse 
them with solvents 
other possibilities are waterbased baths and aerosol sprays 
until one system is proved best laboratory director mimi 
lampert of chicagos newberry library will continue to preserve the 
private institutions rarest books pagebypage and to lock the 
rest in darkness in a 10level windowless climatecontrolled 
tower 
in essence we keep our books in a huge thermos bottle she 
said 
few public institutions however could afford to adopt the 
newberrys measures which even include whitegloved pageturners 
who are the only people allowed to touch certain books 
studies in new york and the netherlands proved that atmospheric 
pollutants have a role in the deterioration of books but ms 
lampert said the main culprit is the acid content of the paper 
itself 
the deterioration first sets in as yellowing and soon progresses 
to brittleness finally the paper simply crumbles 
ironically the destructive process works faster in newer books 
preservationists said books printed before 1850 are relatively 
immune because the linen rag paper used in earlier centuries was 
acidfree 
modern mass publishing involves cheaper woodpulp paper which 
contains acid neutralizing acid is the key to preservation miller 
said 
millers company using a process developed at the library of 
congress seals books in a vacuum chamber where they are permeated 
with vapors of diethyl zinc zinc oxide then binds with the paper 
neutralizing the acid 
it also makes the paper fluoresce bright orange under 
ultraviolet light so it can also be used as an identification and 
antitheft device for rare books miller said 
the process was first demonstrated in a kitchen pressure cooker 
but is now done in chambers developed by the national aeronautics 
and space administration miller said 
smiths process developed with the national archives of canada 
soaks books in a solution of magnesium carbonate liquified freon 
and wood alcohol his company also produces an aerosol spray for 
use by private book collectors 
none of the systems are going to save paper that is already 
brittle ms lampert said

star mary decker slaney and the american was unable to continue 
budd finished seventh amid a chorus of boos 
she later set several world distance running records while

from what doctors said was complete mental exhaustion she says 
she plans to forego international competition and live in her 
homeland indefinitely

miles of track cast off by the big railroad 
companies and now operated by smaller lines are vital to rural 
america an agriculture department report said tuesday 
martin fitzpatrick administrator of the departments office of 
transportation said the number and mileage of small railroads 
began to increase in the 1970s but gained a full head of steam in 
the mid1980s 
as for the future he said that growth in the local and 
regional railroad movement probably will be determined by the 
outcome of court rulings as to the rights of rail labor in branch 
line sales and in transactions that create new railroads 
since the staggers act of 1980 which eased the way for big rail 
companies to sell off unprofitable branch lines nearly 200 small 
railroads have been formed the report said a fifth of these are 
owned by shippers 
local and regional railroads now operate over approximately 15 
percent of the nations rail system or 30000 miles and employ 
30000 people the report said last year these carriers 
generated 15 billion in revenues 
small railroads are freight lines that earn less than 20 
million annually and operate less than 350 miles of track 
the report said that as much as 25000 additional miles of rail 
line are expected to be cast off by large railroads before they are 
finished with restructuring plans eighteen thousand miles are to 
be sold to small railroads over the next two years 
these carriers will function primarily as feeder lines 
originating in rural agricultural regions and funneling traffic 
into the national rail network the report said

television coverage radio equipment and 
newspaper cameras were barred from former hud secretary samuel r 
pierce jrs confrontation with congress on tuesday a ban forced 
by his lawyer against what he charged was the panels circuslike 
atmosphere 
we pulled the plug from their main act because in fact we 
thought it would create a more somber forum attorney paul l 
perito said 
the circuslike atmosphere has been created by them not by 
us perito said before television cameras assembled outside the 
congressional hearing where pierce appeared under subpoena 
with the cameras gone pierce invoked his constitutional right 
against selfincrimination and refused to answer the subcommittees 
questions 
pierces lawyer invoked a house rule that dates to the mccarthy 
hearings of the 1950s it allows witnesses subpoenaed to appear 
before congress to bar broadcast coverage and still photographs of 
their appearance 
four television networks abc cbs cnn and nbc failed in 
their attempt to win a temporary injunction from a federal judge in 
washington on monday to prevent pierce from invoking the rule 
rep tom lantos dcalif chairman of the house government 
operations subcommittee on employment and housing which is probing 
pierces tenure as secretary of housing and urban development said 
he favored repealing the rule and was reluctantly enforcing it 
lantos permitted full coverage of the subcommittee by radio 
television and photographers for an hour and 15 minutes while he 
and other members discussed their investigation and pierces likely 
refusal to testify 
pierce did not enter the committee room however until after 
lantos called a brief recess and ordered television radio and 
still photographic coverage to cease 
three television cameras remained in the room apparently shut 
off with their lenses pointing away from pierce 
lantos then appealed to pierce a final time to reconsider the 
ban on coverage 
on advice of my counsel i ask that the rule be employed 
pierce said 
reporters remained in the room however and artists for the 
television networks sketched the scene 
lantos permitted reporters to use tape recorders to record 
pierces words 
the subcommittee staff asked reporters who recorded the event to 
sign a brief statement saying the audio recording will not be 
broadcast in any manner the document said reporters agreed 
under the penalty of perjury 
pierce read a brief statement saying he would not answer 
questions then invoked his constitutional right each time as 
lantos posed eight questions 
after pierce left camras and microphones were allowed to record 
subcommittee members criticism of the former hud secretary 
pierce is under subpoena to appear again oct 27 perito said he 
would decide then whether he will seek to ban coverage again

the way of life in a city that 
prospered centuries before columbus is depicted in a new exhibit 
that should correct the view of those whose only knowledge of 
indians comes from television westerns an organizer says 
the mississippian indians who lived on what is now the cahokia 
mounds state historic site between 900 and 1200 ad made a unique 
attempt at urbanization experts say the site with its 
distinctive earthen mounds built for indian ceremonies is the 
largest archaelogical site in the country 
the 82 million visitors center that opened here last weekend 
features a video program reconstructed buildings and other 
displays intended to show what life was like in the indians city 
which is believed to have had a population of 20000 
were giving people an appreciation and insight into 
prehistoric indian culture said bill iseminger a staff member 
at the new visitors center were trying to educate people about 
indian culture before the time of columbus 
the indians had a political and religious culture and a 
welldefined social order of civil leaders priests and nobles and 
a working class experts say 
visitors to the world heritage interpretive center will get an 
introduction to this culture with a widescreen video presentation 
on the indians life centered around thatchedroof huts and the 
ceremonial mounds 
everybody thinks that indians lived in tepees and rode horses 
and of course these indians didnt have those things iseminger 
said 
its not the typical idyllic setting people usually associate 
with native americans because it had reached the urban stage he 
said adding that this included some of the same problems plaguing 
modernday city dwellers such as pollution and overcrowding 
the exhibits will change about every three months an outdoor 
courtyard will be the site for classes and demonstrations of indian 
crafts and skills 
the reconstituted village features several kinds of structures 
including a ceremonial sweat lodge and a grainery used for storage 
huts have thatched roofs made of native prairie grass 
we may even build a small mound iseminger said 
iseminger said the center should be an excellent educational 
tool 
we expect increased awareness and more people gaining 
knowledge about indian life in the prehistoric period he said

experts probing the explosion that destroyed a 
french dc10 over niger and killed all 171 people aboard believe 
they have found traces of the powerful explosive semtex in the 
wreckage two french dailies said tuesday 
the newspapers liberation and le parisien said the find 
strengthened the connection between the uta airline crash and the 
dec 21 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie 
scotland 
the uta flight originated in brazzaville congo and blew up 
over a desert less than an hour after it took off for paris on 
sept 19 following a stopover in ndjamena chad 
both newspaper accounts cited unidentified sources involved in 
the investigation and said laboratory tests in paris still had to 
confirm the presence of semtex a malleable hardtodetect 
explosive made in czechoslovakia 
liberation said the charge may have been concealed in a shipment 
of farm chemicals loaded aboard the dc10 in brazzaville 
french investigators said earlier it appears certain an 
explosive substance in a front cargo compartment caused the 
crash but gave few details 
it is believed that a radiocassette player containing semtex 
was smuggled onto the pan am flight that exploded over lockerbie 
killing 270 people all 259 aboard the plane and 11 on the ground 
the major suspect in that bombing was the syrianbacked popular 
front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command the groups 
leader ahmed jibril denied involvement 
anonymous callers in beirut and london claimed responsibility 
for the uta crash on behalf of the moslem extremist group islamic 
jihad and a previously unknown chadian organization those claims 
were not authenticated and french police appeared to be treating 
them with skepticism

most students ended a twoweek boycott of 
motley elementary school on tuesday after school officials and a 
black parents group settled a dispute over naming the school for 
civil rights leader martin luther king jr 
the west lowndes parents association and the lowndes county 
chapter of the national association for the advancement of colored 
people agreed monday to accept a compromise reached during an 
eighthour negotiation sunday with members of the county school 
board 
the compromise came after two days of meetings that mediator wil 
colom a columbus attorney said showed real leadership in 
solving an emotional dispute 
under the compromise the school will be known officially as 
west lowndes elementary but the building itself will be named 
after king 
this retains the boards position on naming a school after the 
area in which it is located the compromise said 
other buildings at any school site can also be named for 
individuals who are deceased and whose names will not inflame the 
community it added 
the old school name of motley reflected the name of the local 
unincorporated community but blacks protested that the community 
was named for the family that owned a plantation in the area in 
slaveholding times 
tuesdays attendance at the elementary school was 350 out of 425 
pupils expected officials said 
only 32 students attended sept 12 the first day of school 
because of dissatisfaction over the schools name and its 
incomplete construction there were 212 students at the school 
monday officials reported 
the compromise also says that when the board selects a new 
assistant superintendent of education primary consideration will 
be given to a candidates ability to communicate with and work with 
minority students parents and staff 
the west lowndes parents association and the naacp had wanted a 
black assistant superintendent 
the deal still needs federal court approval under a 1970 court 
desegregation order 
school board approval came in a 45minute closed session monday 
board president gary chism wouldnt give the vote tally or answer 
any questions

health secretary louis sullivan said tuesday 
the country must renew our commitment to improving the health 
of black americans who are dying younger than white americans 
sullivan cited a new government report showing life expectancy 
for blacks is several years shorter than for whites and that blacks 
have higher death rates than whites for infant mortality and for 
several diseases including aids 
even as the lines on almost every disease chart move toward 
improvement there is a continuing disparity in the burden of death 
and illness experienced by blacks and other minority americans as 
compared with the improving health of americans as a whole 
sullivan said 
we must renew our commitment to close these health 
disparities he said 
the report of mortality statistics for 1987 by the national 
center for health statistics shows that life expectancy at birth 
rose slightly from 1986 to reach a record high of 75 years in 1987 
life expectancy for white americans was 756 years but for blacks 
it was 694 years the same as the previous year according to the 
report 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome was the 10th leading cause 
of death for blacks while it ranked 15th for the us population 
overall in 1987 
of the more than 13000 aids deaths 65 percent were white 
males 25 percent were black males and the remaining 10 percent 
were split evenly between white females and black females 
blacks also died at disproportionately higher rates from other 
illnesses including kidney disease for which the black death rate 
was 28 times the rate of the white population and diabetes for 
which the black death rate was 23 times that for whites according 
to the report 
the rate of infant mortality declined slightly in 1987 to 101 
infant deaths per 1000 live births from 104 the previous year 
the rate for whites dropped from 89 to 86 while the rate for 
blacks declined from 18 to 179 
the report also shows the drugrelated death rate for blacks was 
more than twice the rate for whites and the homicide death rate 
for blacks was six times that of whites

president bush said tuesday he hopes his 
twoday education summit with the nations governors this week will 
produce ways to dramatically change things in americas 
troubled schools 
weve got to see what it is were doing wrong how can we be 
more accountable bush told reporters after hearing business 
leaders complain about the problems that poorly educated students 
cause in the workplace 
bush will travel by helicopter to charlottesville va on 
wednesday afternoon for an education summit with the governors on 
the university of virginia campus 
it will be only the third such presidential convocation of 
governors in history and the first since president franklin d 
roosevelt summoned governors more than half a century ago for their 
advice on coping with the great depression 
even before the governors gathered at thomas jeffersons 
academical village educators and politicians were expressing 
hope that the summit would give new impetus to a school reform 
movement that has shown signs of floundering 
white house officials and leaders of the national governors 
association have said the meetings top priority will be to lay the 
groundwork for the first set of national performance goals for the 
schools 
bush who promised in last years election campaign to become 
the education president said i think were going to come 
together with the governors on major objectives for this country in 
terms of education something thats never been done before 
he said he has his ideas for changes but was keeping them 
private im going down there to listen and work with the 
governors not try to impose an agenda from here he said 
i want to see us come up with some suggestions that will 
dramatically change things bush said i was just reminded by a 
group of business leaders that on a per capita basis we spent far 
more than germany far more than japan and yet were not achieving 
the way they are 
weve got to see what it is were doing wrong how can we be 
more accountable he said its in those areas of goals 
national goals but coming up through the governors that i think 
we can make a real contribution 
john f akers chairman of international business machines corp 
who led a business roundtable delegation of corporate executives 
who met with bush scoffed at the notion that americas 353 
billion education system suffers from a lack of money 
theres twice as much money per student than is available in 
japan and the japanese are beating our brains out akers said 
its not a money problem he said its a management and 
an execution problem 
the business roundtable executives including the chairmen of 
xerox du pont bell south k mart procter amp gamble alcoa and 
union carbide pledged that they and other leaders of the 200 major 
companies would get personally involved with school improvement 
efforts in their home states 
were not getting enough educated people to fill the jobs 
of importance to american industry akers said 
david kearns the xerox chairman said we dont yet have any 
momentum in the country for real structural change in the 
schools 
he said the summit could draw the governors and the 
administration into a coalition to really drive this 
kearns said that among needed changes are increased authority 
for teachers and principals to run the schools the way they need 
to not the educational bureaucracy 
also he said we need head start for everybody the 11 
billion preschool development program for poor children now reaches 
fewer than 20 percent of those eligible 
while bush supports head start he has sought to dampen 
educators hopes that any major new commitment of federal funds 
will flow from the education summit 
we would not expect to come out with any new funding 
proposals white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said tuesday 
bush will open the summit wednesday with a welcome address to 
the governors then begin the first three of six closed working 
sessions 
the topics will include revitalizing the teaching profession 
improving the learning environment including keeping drugs out of 
schools and governance or determining who is in charge of the 
schools 
after a state dinner wednesday night in a tent outside 
monticello jeffersons home near the university bush and the 
governors will reassemble thursday morning for the final three 
working sessions on choice and restructuring a competitive work 
force and postsecondary education 
those sessions attended by subgroups of the governors and 
bushs cabinet will be followed by a plenary session a luncheon 
convocation and a finale at which republican and democratic 
governors will join bush in delivering closing statements 
after his return to washington bush will speak about the summit 
at a white house ceremony honoring outstanding secondary schools 
minnesotas democratic governor rudy perpich sent word he will 
miss the summit a leading advocate of bushs proposal to give 
parents more choice over which schools their children attend 
perpich sent word he is staying at home to work for passage of a 
tax bill at a special session of the state legislature 
theodore roosevelt convened the first governors summit in 1908 
to discuss the urgency of preserving the countrys natural 
resources a governors conference held in 1933 by his distant 
cousin franklin roosevelt was overshadowed by the presidents 
decision to close the banks on the morning of the summit

james meredith the black man who cracked the 
color barrier at the university of mississippi 27 years ago has 
been hired to what some see as an unlikely post adviser to 
conservative sen jesse helms 
meredith said in an interview tuesday that he had been hired 
officially on sept 5 to advise the senator on questions of race 
education drugs and urban problems after providing informal 
advice for the last year 
meredith 58 has changed his views markedly since becoming the 
first black enrolled at ole miss in 1962 since then he has called 
integration the biggest con job ever pulled on anybody 
my understanding of the senators position is that every 
citizen has the entitlement to every right he said tuesday so 
theres no need for any specific rights and i agree with that 
it is the specific intent of the liberal elite to establish on 
a permanent basis a dual citizenship in the united states they 
need to keep blacks in a non fullcitizenship status its not 
senator helms who doesnt want blacks to be free in america its 
the liberal agenda 
in a letter to acquaintances he wrote that helms who is up for 
reelection next year wants to provide the best possible 
representation to them as well as the entire black population 
some civil rights leader were nonetheless astonished at 
merediths decision to join helms staff 
its somewhat of a shock to me said benjamin hooks of the 
naacp ive watched merediths progression or maybe i should 
say retrogression from being a militant civil rights advocate to 
another stand altogether but i didnt know he had changed to the 
point he would fit in with sen helms staff 
without question senator helms has one of the worst civil 
rights voting records in the congress said ralph neas of the 
washingtonbased leadership conference on civil rights for years 
he has led the rightwing opposition to effective civil rights laws 
and remedies he is a senator markedly out of step with the 
bipartisan consensus on civil rights in this country 
while meredith was battling segregation in the south during the 
60s the conservative helms was gaining a following as a raleigh 
television editorialist who harshly criticized the movement to 
bring about racial change 
since his election to the senate in 1972 helms has vigorously 
opposed civil rights bills and other domestic programs favored by 
many blacks he has defended the white minority government of south 
africa fought making martin luther king jrs birthday a national 
holiday and criticized such national black leaders as jesse jackson 
meredith entered the allwhite university of mississippi after 
spending nine years in the air force his arrival on campus caused 
rioting two people died and president kennedy sent in troops and 
federal marshals 
since then meredith who was wounded during a freedom march in 
mississippi in 1965 has held numerous jobs in various parts of the 
country most recently living in cincinnati where he worked as a 
financial planner and tree farmer

the parcel senior soviet negotiator viktor p karpov said 
even so the white house welcomed soviet acceptance of president 
bushs initiative 
at the white house bush said i am very pleased with the way 
things are going weve got some good common ground that i 
dont think we had before 
and bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater said the soviet 
response shows that we are on the same wavelength it was a very 
constructive response our ultimate objective is total elimination 
of chemical weapons and it appears that both nations are now ready 
to act 
the soviet position was outlined by foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze in a speech to the un general assembly and then by 
karpov at a news conference 
the two sides disagreed on whether the soviet plan went beyond 
bushs initiative but the two approaches clearly differed in two 
significant ways 
bush would have the superpowers retain 2 percent of their 
chemical weapons until all nations capable of building chemical 
weapons sign an international ban 
and as the president explained his proposal monday in a speech 
to the general assembly the united states would keep producing 
new binary weapons while destroying older stocks 
binary weapons are deadly but only when they are mixed 
shevardnadze praised bushs move and said the soviet union 
together with the united states is ready to go further 
he called for a cessation of production at a news conference 
later deputy foreign minister karpov said soviet acceptance was 
conditional on a halt to us production of binary weapons 
it is part of the parcel said karpov the highestranked 
arms control expert in the soviet hierarchy it will not be 
sufficient to get rid of old weapons if the united states is going 
to produce new ones 
a second key difference between the two sides centers on when 
all us and soviet chemical weapons would be destroyed 
bush said the united states was ready to destroy 98 percent of 
its weapons in the first eight years of an agreement with moscow 
the remaining 2 percent would be retained until 40 nations now 
negotiating in geneva agreed on a treaty to ban chemical weapons 
and all nations with the capability to produce them signed the pact 
this would mean an outright ban depended on the approval of such 
nations as iran and iraq and possibly libya which the reagan 
administration says is on the verge of production iraq and iran 
have been accused of using poison gas in their persian gulf war 
that ended last year 
karpov said the soviets were willing to destroy all their 
chemical weapons once the treaty was completed 
we wouldnt bar the treaty entering into force if there is one 
nation capable of producing chemical weapons he said 
karpov said the soviets were not helping any country to 
manufacture chemical weapons he placed the soviet arsenal at 
50000 tons 
bush administration officials have declined to divulge the us 
total the general assumption is that it is about 30000 tons 
shevardnadze also called on the two superpowers to renounce 
the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances 
and the soviet foreign minister said they should employ 
rigorous verification of the cessation of production of chemical 
warfare agents 
shevardnadze and secretary of state james a baker iii agreed 
last week in talks in jackson hole wyo on a twostep plan for 
exchanging information about chemical weapons and for trial 
inspections of stockpiles 
baker had a sevenminute meeting with shevardnadze after the 
foreign minister delivered his speech 
he told reporters he had to study the soviet chemical weapons 
proposal and that it did not appear to go beyond bushs initiative 
but karpov said our proposal is a wider one 
he said moscow was ready to begin negotiations with the united 
states to reduce stockpiles on both sides 
shevardnadze in his speech welcomed bushs initiative and said 
we share the desire to rid mankind of these barbaric weapons

nasa administrator richard h truly resisted a 
house subcommittees efforts tuesday to get him to estimate how 
much it will cost to go to mars but complained that congressional 
cuts in the agencys 1990 budget wont help 
noting that the national aeronautics and space administrations 
budget is no more than 1 percent of total federal spending truly 
told the panel that ratio will have to increase if the nation is 
serious about moving out to the moon again and beyond to mars 
already he said house and senate appropriations committee 
moves to slash nasas 205 billion budget request by as much as 
400 million is forcing the agency to consider slowing its 
construction schedule for the spacestation that is planned as a 
forerunner to moon and mars missions 
however truly stoutly denied news reports that the pending 
budget cuts are forcing the agency to redesign the station 
were not redesigning the station he said its more a 
matter of pacing the construction of the station 
truly the first former astronaut to head the space agency 
acknowledged that president bushs goal for a manned mission to 
mars will take a commitment by a succession of administrations over 
three or four decades and will be costly 
however he declined to give even a rough guess of how much nasa 
budgets would have to grow to reach the goal we are not far 
enough to have a program plan he said to several subcommittee 
members who pressed him for an estimate 
rep bill nelson dfla chairman of the science space and 
technology space science subcommittee predicted the nasa budget 
would have to swell to at least 15 billion a year and perhaps 30 
billion 
while supporting the goal of sending a manned mission to mars 
nelson told truly it would be better to bypass the moon lest that 
program eat up too much money 
he did not press truly on that point however saying 
therell be plenty of time to debate that over the next three 
years before a final decision is made

the soviet legislature on tuesday tackled the 
problem of public anger over private businesses that earn fat 
profits by providing scarce goods and services 
cooperative businesses are one of the few successes of president 
mikhail s gorbachevs economic reform program they have grown 
dramatically since they were legalized 2 years ago and now provide 
20 billion worth of goods and services deputy premier leonid i 
abalkin said tuesday 
but decades of propaganda instilled into many soviets a strong 
feeling that earning a profit is evil 
deputy veniamin yarin of nizhni tagilsk pointed up the mood of 
much of the public when he said cooperatives engage in open 
robbery of the working man 
the cooperatives exemption from statecontrolled prices and the 
high wages paid to their employees reinforce public resentment 
some cooperatives are victims of extortion by organized crime 
others are fronts for thieves 
even gorbachev asked the legislature how the cooperatives manage 
to find soap when no one else can and he noted that the 
cooperative price might be 5 rubles about 775 for a bar of 
soap when a state store would charge 40 kopecks 62 cents to 1 
ruble 155 
we have to take into account the mood of the people he 
said as the legislators began debating proposed amendments that 
would give local governments more power to regulate cooperatives 
gorbachev stood by his creations however 
the main thing for us is to preserve cooperatives he said 
people see the evident difference between them those providing 
services manufacturing producing construction materials 
repairing helping are more than welcome by the people all those 
intermediary cooperatives are considered to be thieves what is the 
way out of this situation 
if we do not set this matter in order we will doom the 
cooperative movement 
one deputy even proposed closing down all wholesale and retail 
cooperatives but this was defeated the soviet news agency tass 
said 
we educate people to be engineers and they sit in public 
restrooms and collect 20 kopecks 31 cents for each visitor who 
comes to execute his natural functions said deputy leonid sukhov 
he was referring to both the high prices charged by cooperatives 
and the high wages paid to their employees which entice talented 
people into leaving jobs in state enterprises 
gorbachev told the deputies he was faced with an ultimatum 
on cooperatives when he met last week with workers and collective 
farmers who are members of the communist partys central bodies 
but deputy anatoly sobchak head of the legal faculty at 
leningrad state university said cooperatives in some areas were 
facing wholesale closure by local governments that were ignoring 
the law 
abalkin one of gorbachevs closest economic advisers told the 
deputies that cooperatives are making the first step toward 
forming a socialist market which we have been talking about for so 
long 
he argued problems that cause public outrage over cooperatives 
actually are the problems of the entire soviet economy such as 
severe shortages of basic goods and services 
abalkin said soviet society must recognize that cooperatives are 
an important part of the economy agree to treat them equally with 
state business and allow local governments to regulate them in 
order to take into account local needs and viewpoints 
tass said these amendments and another regulating wages paid by 
cooperatives were sent to a legislative committee for refinement 
the 542member twochamber supreme soviet presided over by 
gorbachev has reconvened at a time of widespread turmoil and 
discontent caused by the demands of ethnic groups and by the state 
economys failure to meet many basic needs 
the legislature also created a commission to review press 
coverage of deputy boris yeltsins tour of the united states 
pravda stirred up a storm when it reprinted an italian newspapers 
article charging yeltsin with drinking and shopping his way across 
america pravda later apologized but some deputies have called for 
the resignation of pravda editor viktor g afanasiev

the government of venezuela has retreated from 
its demand for a 50 percent reduction in its 21 billion debt 
hoping to rejuvenate stalled negotiations with commercial banks 
officials said tuesday 
instead venezuela will offer banks a broad menu of options 
that will include lesser discounts in exchange for weaker 
guarantees of remaining debt said venezuelan planning minister 
miguel rodriguez fandeo who is in charge of his countrys 
debtreduction effort 
he also announced that a consortium of 15 banks has agreed to a 
600 million shortterm loan to allow venezuela to catch up with 
missed interest payments by dec 31 the government is contributing 
400 million from its reserves to wiping out the missed payments 
he said 
briefing reporters at the annual meeting of the 152nation 
international monetary fund and its sister organization the world 
bank rodriguez insisted that the new strategy did not mean 
venezuela had retreated from its goal of the largest possible 
reduction in debt and debt service 
debt reduction is the keystone of treasury secretary nicholas f 
bradys initiative announced in march a month after bloody riots 
in venezuela focused attention on the plight of developing 
countries mired by a crushing 13 trillion debt burden 
because of the riots venezuela was one of the first countries 
singled out for debt reduction by the bush administration but 
commercial banks have concluded pacts with mexico and the 
philippines first bankers have accused venezuela of being 
intransigent in its demands 
brady in an afternoon speech to world bank and imf delegates 
admonished both developing countries and their creditors toward 
flexibility citing discussions between banks and costa rica 
venezuela morocco uruguay and chile 
an important challenge at the moment appears to be the problem 
of unrealistic expectations both among debtor countries and the 
banks brady said in one sense improving expectations was 
essential to restoring forward momentum in the debt strategy 
in another sense however we must recognize that rising 
expectations need to be tempered by realism 
excessive expectations can only promote delays increase the 
risk of breakdown in negotiations and ultimately raise the economic 
costs to the banks and debtor countries brady said 
rodriguez said his country will continue to offer to buy back 
its loans in cash in exchange for a 60 percent discount and issue 
guaranteed bonds for a 50 percent debt reduction 
however it will also be willing to accept a lower discount if 
banks accept bonds with weaker guarantees than the 50 percent bonds 
in addition venezuela will accept new loans from the banks but 
only to the extent necessary to compensate for debt reduction less 
than 50 percent the planning minister said 
he said his country is shifting its policy in hope of 
accommodating banks which because of tax and other regulations 
are unable to take a 50 percent loss on the loans rodriguez said 
the new strategy should allow a greater number of banks to 
participate in a debtreduction pact which he said venezuela would 
like to conclude by the end of the year 
the 600 million shortterm loan was offered by 15 banks led by 
chase manhattan bank bank of america bank of tokyo and lloyds 
bank said pedro tinoco jr president of venezuelas central bank

two b2 stealth bomber test flights were cut 
short last week once because of a renewed oilpressure problem and 
once because of high winds the pentagon said tuesday 
a planned 5hour flight sept 21 was scrubbed after three hours 
after indications of low oil pressure in the planes no 1 airframe 
accessory drive said pentagon spokesman pete williams 
the batwing bomber is designed to pass through enemy radar 
virtually undetected the accessory drive is the gear box that 
powers the jets generators and controls 
the same problem had forced the crew to scub the second test 
flight of the 530 million plane on aug 16 
as with the second flight the b2 was landed early as a 
precaution williams said the flight crew was in no danger 
four new casings were installed for the stealths fifth test 
flight saturday and no oilpressure problems were encountered 
williams said 
however that flight ended after 77 minutes because of gusty 
winds at the altitude at which the plane was flying william 
said adding that he could not say what the wind strengths were 
it was decided to cut that flight short as a precaution because 
of the stress being placed on the bomber during the particular 
maneuvers being conducted williams said 
that doesnt mean that the plane cant fly at high winds he 
said 
the crew did complete an airrefueling test under which the 
batwing jet purposely stopped just short of its refueling kc10 
aircraft 
williams said the stealth wont be flown again for at least five 
weeks while planned modifications and ground vibration tests 
are done 
the plane has flown a total of 12 hours williams said 
the air force says the stealth has performed better than 
expected in areas of handling qualities especially smooth aircraft 
control in the fueling position he said 
when questioned williams said the air force hadnt said in 
which areas the plane hasnt performed up to expectations 
the government has spent about 224 billion in the b2 program 
which is 18 months behind schedule and congress has balked at 
paying more than 500 million each for 132 bombers 
shrouded in secrecy for 10 years manufacturer northrop corp 
and the pentagon have begun an an intensive campaign to counter 
those who question the planes capabilities 
the pentagon wants 47 billion for the bomber in the coming 
fiscal year and may need 8 billion in each of the three years of 
peak production 199294

the house began debate tuesday on a huge 
budget bill weighed down by such unconnected issues as catastrophic 
illness insurance child care pornographic telephone services and 
the fight over president bushs capital gains tax cut 
its so full of irrelevancies it is hardly recognizable as 
a budget bill said rep bill frenzel rminn let the games 
begin he added as debate began 
in an unusual procedure the house opened debate on the bill 
before agreeing to a schedule for the amendments the budget 
portion is designed to reduce the fiscal 1990 federal deficit by 
166 billion 
during the day democratic leaders scrambled to find more votes 
for their amendment which would derail the capital gains tax cut 
house speaker thomas s foley said reaction to the democratic 
alternative which would raise tax rates for the wealthy to restore 
deductions for individual retirement accounts was encouraging 
from the white house however bush sent letters to all house 
members calling his tax cut the right policy for all americans 
and saying he would veto the democratic alternative should it be 
approved 
a vote on that provision originally slated for wednesday was 
delayed at least until thursday while the behindthescenes 
political wrangling continued 
rep jim slattery dkan who opposes the bushbacked plan to 
drop the maximum capital gains rate from 33 percent to 196 percent 
for the next 27 months conceded the democrats didnt have the 
votes 
but the other side hasnt got the votes yet either he said 
while capital gains has been the most partisan fight other 
issues have broad public impact including at least three competing 
child care amendments 
the house is retreating from past actions with an amendment 
expected next week to repeal the new medicare catastrophic health 
insurance program elderly groups have protested the new taxes 
levied on the elderly to pay for their additional coverage 
business groups have lobbied successfully for a repeal of rules 
mandating nondiscrimination in their health plans 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and 
means committee said the house was signaling our willingness to 
bow to any special interest group that is aggressive and 
singleminded enough to hound us into submission 
but my disappointment with this bill is minor when 
compared to my disappointment with the president rostenkowski 
said the president has squandered the first year of his 
presidency on symbolic victories 
what will he have to show for it at the end of this year 
rostenkowski said legislation to protect the flag from a handful 
of misguided exhibitionists a blueprint for a drug war that is 
doomed for failure because he refuses to pay for it a plan to sail 
to mars and if he gets his way and a tax cut for the wealthiest 5 
percent of our population in a year when our deficit exceeds 130 
billion 
rep leon panetta dcalif the chairman of the house budget 
committee called on lawmakers to stick with the bill even if they 
dont like some of the provisions or amendments 
if the bill is not enacted in some form he reminded the 
house the grammrudman law will require more than 16 billion in 
automatic spending cuts in both domestic and military programs the 
law mandates those cuts if congress and the president fail to 
reduce the deficit to within 10 billion of the 100 billion target 
for fiscal 1990 which begins oct 1 
the deficit reduction is supposed to be in place by oct 15 but 
foley said tuesday he didnt expect that do be done the result 
will be what he said will be a sort of technical cutback but 
he expected the house senate and administration to work out their 
differences to avoid any permanent reductions

operators of private bus companies complained 
tuesday before a house subcommittee that the proposed americans 
with disabilities act could force them to cut service especially 
to the poor and rural dwellers 
most of the testimony centered on the requirements under the 
proposed legislation that intercity bus fleets be made accessible 
to the disabled within six or seven years of enactment 
the bus operators interpret that requirement as a mandate that 
all buses be equipped with wheelchair lifts which they say cost 
from 10000 to 35000 per bus to install not to mention 
maintenance costs 
the mandatory lift requirement with its attendant costs 
including installation seat loss and possible package express 
loss would spell the end of intercity bus service in the united 
states said frank m henry chairman of the american bus 
association 
the operators are proposing alternatives such as a system of 
leasing equipped buses or having a limited number in the fleet 
making those buses available on call 
advocates for the disabled say they have the same right to 
spontaneous travel that others have and a reservations system or 
other limited availability would prevent that 
with 200000 buses in the total fleet operated by members of the 
american bus association the cost of installing lifts would would 
range from 20 million to 70 million said henry of wilkesbarre 
pa 
he told the surface transportation subcommittee of the committee 
on public works and transportation that by contrast the industry 
had operating income of 415 million from 19821986 
the bus operators say the installation of wheelchair lifts would 
result in the loss of up to four revenueproducing seats not to 
mention cargo and luggage space and modifying restrooms 
owners also testified that where wheelchair access was in place 
demand was minimal 
advocates for the disabled told the subcommittee however that 
the bill does not specify wheelchair lifts but added that the lift 
technology is so advanced that the cost estimates given by the 
industry are exaggerated 
most of the testimony tuesday and in a hearing by the 
subcommittee last week dealt with the costs of lifts 
a germandesigned lift used on denver buses costs 11000 
removes only one seat and occupies no baggage space said marilyn 
golden of the disability rights education and defense fund 
she also said there is no requirement to modify restrooms 
adding that the disabled have had long experience coping without 
bathrooms 
she and several other witnesses disputed the claims of low 
ridership saying the disabled have been conditioned not be be able 
to expect to travel 
it takes time for them to believe the word yes said john 
winski assistant director of the massachusetts coalition of 
citizens with disabilities

soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze on tuesday accepted president bushs call for deep 
ussoviet chemical arms cuts and challenged the united states to 
go further and faster 
shevardnadze said the soviet union will radically reduce or 
completely destroy its chemical weapons halt nuclear tests and 
stop making weaponsgrade plutonium and uranium all if washington 
reciprocates 
shevardnadze speaking to the un general assembly said the 
two governments have narrowed their differences and he predicted 
that by the ussoviet summit next spring or summer we may have 
passed the last turn on the road toward a treaty reducing 
strategic arms by 50 percent 
there was a quick response from the white house bush said i 
am very pleased with the way things are going the reaction from 
the soviets to our proposals yesterday has been positive so now the 
goal is to get moving and try to work out these agreements 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater called 
shevardnadzes statements a very constructive response our 
ultimate objective is total elimination of chemical weapons and it 
appears that both nations are now ready to act 
shevardnadze also said that if nato countries agree to start 
talks on tactical nuclear weapons the soviet union will respond by 
further unilateral cuts in its tactical nuclear missiles in europe 
he repeated his governments call for a nuclear test ban and 
said moscow was considering extending a 1963 treaty to cover 
underground nuclear explosions 
secretary of state james a baker iii later praised 
shevardnadzes nearly hourlong address as a good speech an 
interesting speech he called it very responsive to the 
presidents statement on chemical weapons 
but viktor p karpov the soviet unions chief arms control 
expert told reporters our proposal is a wider one and does 
not wait to destroy all weapons or halt production until all 
nations capable of producing them have signed a ban 
it will not be sufficient only to get rid of old weapons if 
the united states is going to produce new chemical weapons 
karpov said 
bush told the general assembly on monday that the united states 
will destroy more than 80 percent of its chemical weapons before 
an international treaty banning use of the weapons is signed if 
the soviet union will reduce its arms to a similar level that 
would mean greater cuts by the soviet union which has a larger 
stockpile 
bush said in the first eight years of a chemical weapons treaty 
the united states would be ready to destroy 98 percent of its 
arsenal if the soviet union joins the ban the united states would 
destroy all chemical weapons within 10 years once every nation 
capable of building the weapons signs the treaty he said 
shevardnadze said the soviet union is ready together with 
the united states to go further and assume mutual obligations 
prior to the conclusion of a multilateral convention 
the soviet union offered to 
cease production of chemical weapons as it says it already 
has done including more sophisticated binary weapons 
renounce the use of those barbaric weapons under any 
circumstances 
institute rigorous verification of the cessation of production 
shevardnadze praised the ussoviet dialogue and said progress 
had been made in recent talks 
these talks have demonstrated the increasing awareness by both 
sides of the need to cooperate for the benefit of mankind and the 
growing confidence that such cooperation is possible 
agreement to hold a summit meeting next year he said shows 
that we have moved quite far ahead in solving a number of major 
bilateral and international problems 
but he said extraordinary efforts at the highest level will be 
needed to conclude an agreement on a 50 percent reduction in 
strategic offensive arms our partners have accommodated us on 
mobile intercontinental balistic missiles he said positions on 
other outstanding problems have become closer to each other 
in our view by the time the summit is held next year in late 
spring or early summer we may have passed the last turn on the 
road toward a treaty reducing strategic offensive arms 
in a speech that praised the right of a people to choose its 
government and course of development shevardnadze also wished 
every success to polands new government the first east bloc 
government not led by communists he pledged to cooperate with it 
he also praised bushs open skies proposal which would allow 
both nations to fly surveillance missions over the others 
territory 
we like it the soviet union calls for opening up the 
lands the waters and outer space let us have open lands open 
seas and open space only then shall we attain absolute 
transparency and the necessary level of confidence

party was shot and killed tuesday and a marxist guerrilla group

colombian president virgilio barco facing 
escalating violence by drug lords in his country will meet with 
president bush at the white house on thursday evening 
barco will stop in washington on his way to new york to address 
the united nations white house press secretary marlin fitzwater

on monday and tuesday three explosions attributed to drug 
traffickers blasted cartagena and bogota killing two people

troops beyond the military equipment the administration already is 
sending fitzwater said no

requests by the president we respect his rights and wishes as 
president of that country and whether or not he requests any more 
aid in terms of money or troops or whatever is entirely within his 
purview fitzwater said 
the recent bombings the spokesman said are an exclamation 
point to the danger there and to the desperation that the country 
faces in terms of its drug problem it strengthens the commitment 
of everyone to continue the fight 
bush has repeatedly expressed verbal support for barcos efforts 
against the drug traffickers and recently ordered 65 million in 
military equipment and weaponry be sent to assist him 
he also has requested 251 million from congress for next year 
to help peru colombia and bolivia in their drug wars

the 24 nations pooling aid for poland 
and hungary agreed tuesday on the urgency of introducing more 
measures to support political and economic reforms in the two 
eastbloc countries 
in a final communique at the end of a oneday meeting senior 
officials from the 24 donor nations also urged poland and hungary 
to reach agreements with the international monetary fund to 
reschedule their foreign debts 
hungarys foreign debt is about 18 billion the highest per 
capita in eastern europe and polands foreign debt is a 
debilitating 39 billion 
the european communitys executive commission which is 
coordinating the aid efforts has said rescheduling debts is 
outside its mandate 
the communique noted that 271 million worth of food aid has 
been pledged by the 24 nations to be delivered to poland and 
hungary 
it was the second meeting by the 24 nations with another 
scheduled for november 
european community officials put a 648 million price tag on the 
new aid plan with half to be financed by the 12 ec member states 
and the remainder by the 12 other donor nations 
the us delegation which did not announce any new measures to 
add to the 169 million already pledged indicated it could find 
additional funds and said the 648 million should be seen as a 
minimum amount not a ceiling 
by the end of the meeting 133 million was promised by sweden 
denmark norway finland and austria 
the ec proposed paying 216 million from its 1990 budget toward 
the new plan and suggested the european communitys 12 members 
could provide 108 million more on a bilateral basis the other 
donors also would supply 324 million 
jacques delors president of the ec executive commission and 
frans andriessen the ec external relations commisisoner issued a 
statement calling the process of political reform and economic 
liberalization in poland and hungary still very fragile 
they said poles and hungarians could well find their new 
freedoms threatened by economic disorders 
it would be unthinkable to allow such disorders which could 
be alleviated through rapid action to undermine the prospects for 
change in eastern europe they added 
following are major provisions of the fivepoint air program 
proposed tuesday 
to supply such goods as pesticides and farm machinery in 
addition to food being sent to the polish government the food is 
to be shipped free on condition the government uses the money from 
sales to improve the private farm sector 
to improve market access for polish and hungarian goods by 
eliminating quantitative restrictions on their exports and offering 
trade concessions 
to grant both countries loans from the european investment 
bank and include them in loan operations usually reserved for 
developing nations 
to provide professional training including banking and customs 
to prepare poland and hungary for marketoriented economies 
cooperation to clean up industrialized areas and preserve 
historical and cultural sites in both countries 
ec participitation in the plan requires approval by the 12 
governments and the european parliament the other donor nations 
that also must approve the proposals are the six members of the 
european free trade association austria finland iceland norway 
sweden and switzerland along with japan the united states

less than 24 hours after president mikhail s 
gorbachev forcefully threatened to resolve the feud between armenia 
and azerbaijan cargo trains began running to armenia ending an 
economic blockade 
azerbaijani interference with cargo on the rail route into 
armenia had tightened to a total blockade over the past several 
weeks 
the soviet evening news program vremya on tuesday said 14 trains 
arrived in armenia monday night and tuesday delivering food 
medicine newsprint and construction material desperately needed in 
the area of armenia devastated by last decembers earthquake 
but the film showed potatoes in the railroad cars were rotting 
and crawling with maggots after three weeks of sitting outdoors 
the vremya correspondent said none of the railcars contained fuel 
also critically needed 
gorbachev warned at mondays session of the soviet legislature 
that the government would take tougher unspecified steps to settle 
the armenianazerbaijani dispute if the two republics cannot do it 
themselves quickly he did not elaborate 
more than 100 people have been killed in ethnic violence in the 
two republics the past 19 months with much of the conflict 
centering on the disputed territory of nagornokarabakh 
newspapers in yerevan the armenian capital stopped publishing 
last week for lack of newsprint and reconstruction in the 
earthquake zone came to a standstill because of a shortage of 
materials 
neither soviet television nor the official news agency tass gave 
any explanation of how the trains reached their destinations after 
weeks of delay 
tass said 17 trains left for armenia from baku the capital of 
azerbaijan between 6 pm monday and 6 pm tuesday it said their 
750 railcars contained construction supplies food vehicles

the school system for president bushs current 
home town the district of columbia was not on the invitation 
list for the white housesponsored education summit this week 
what i was told by federal education officials is that the 
district wasnt invited to the summit because the city doesnt have 
a governor dc public schools spokeswoman patricia lambe said 
tuesday 
bush has invited the governors of the 50 states as well as 
puerto rico and the virgin islands to the twoday conference 
beginning wednesday in charlottesville va 
under the home rule charter from congress the mayor acts as 
chief executive for the nations capital but relations have 
appeared strained previously between bush administration and mayor 
marion barry 
when administration officials disclosed a series of steps to 
curtail drug trafficking and violence in the district of columbia 
earlier this year barry wasnt present for the announcement 
ms lambe said she was taken aback after none of the 
districts education officials was invited to the meeting 
after all when the federal department of education releases 
education statistics their figures include the district as well as 
the other 50 states she said 
standardized test scores for all students last year were about 
10 percent below the national average the nations capitals 
public school system was also plagued by a 40 percent student drop 
out rate 
lon anderson director of public affairs for the us department 
of education said the fact is no education representative was 
invited from the city because the district is not a state and has 
no governor 
anderson said puerto rico and the virgin islands were invited 
and noted that while they are not states they have governors

seven white police officers have sued the 
city charging that less qualified minority officers were promoted 
unfairly ahead of them under a courtordered affirmative action 
plan 
it could be the first test of a recent supreme court ruling that 
reversed 20 years of affirmative action 
attorney robert e gyemant said tuesday he filed the reverse 
discrimination suit against the city on behalf of the seven 
officers monday in order to obtain a colorblind and sexblind 
opportunity to advance 
gyemant said the officers standing with him at a news 
conference would most or all be captains or lieutenants if they 
had been given an equal opportunity to advance all are patrol 
officers 
the suit filed monday in san francisco superior court claims 
less qualified minority officers have been unfairly promoted in 
order to meet racial quotas set by a 1979 courtordered affirmative 
action plan 
the suit maintains that the city has violated a state civil 
rights law forbidding the use of race or sex as a basis in hiring 
and promotion 
all i want is the opportunity to compete fairly said 
officer lawrence ratti 
also at the news conference were four white female officers who 
said they too suffered from discrimination they are not involved 
in the lawsuit 
officer vicki quinn described the citys promotion policies as 
a lottery quinn a 13year veteran of the force said she was 
one of the first women in the department who passed standards 
held for men 
the lawsuit seeks back pay punitive damages and an end to the 
alleged discrimination the amount of damages sought was not 
revealed 
the san francisco suit may be the first test case for the 
landmark us supreme court decision involving birmingham ala 
that permitted a legal challenge to a courtorder affirmative 
action plan the court decided that white firefighters in 
birmingham hired after a consent decree was approved could fight 
the preferential promotion of allegedly less qualified black 
firefighters 
gyemant who called racial discrimination awful said his 
clients should not be forced to pay the price to right wrongs 
carried out before any of them were involved with the department 
city attorney louise renne said the lawsuit is plowing old 
ground 
this has been going on for 10 years she said just about 
every legal point that could possibly have been raised has been 
but gyemant responded if it is old ground then it certainly 
is about time that were able to deal with this in courts of law 
only one sergeants examination has been given in the san 
francisco police departmant in the last 10 years and that was 
declared recially discriminatory against whites by a federal judge 
he said 
the lawsuit is not designed to fight steps taken to end 
discrimination gyemant said 
all we are saying is why make our clients pay for it all they 
did was serve the city well thats what the lawsuit is all 
about he said

approval to use yugoslav army units in slovenia

under the proposed amendments slovenia would have a lasting 
and inalienable right to selfdetermination including the right to 
secession tanjug reported

special session in belgrade and wrangled over procedural issues 
regarding the proposed constitutional amendments in yugoslavias 
westernmost republic 
slovenian and serbian party chiefs engaged in a sharp exchange

the agenda amounted to political pressure and restriction of the 
sovereign will of the slovenian people

party of serbia said he considered kucans speech an open 
declaration of hostilities 
the slovenian leadership said tuesday the amendments in no way 
contradicted the federal constitution 
in a statement carried by tanjug slovenias ruling presidency 
said federal criticism of the proposed changes could be construed 
as indicating that the authorities were prepared to use force to 
block their adoption

libyan leader col moammar gadhafi on tuesday 
decried moslem vs moslem violence and said guns bombs and 
extremism should only be used to fight the enemies of islam 
the official libyan news agency jana monitored in rome said 
gadhafi told an islamic seminar in tripoli that fighting between 
moslem factions only benefits enemies of the faith 
there is in islam a multitude of contradicting movements 
some of which we made some the americans made and some were made 
by the mossad or the kgb he said referring to israels mossad 
secret service and the soviet unions kgb secret police 
gadhafi said the movements include fundamentalists who want to 
return to the islamic basics and maintain the religions 
traditions morals and customs and other factions that have taken 
a secret violent terrorist and extremist trend for reasons of 
power or wealth 
if such extremism was against the enemies of islam then we 
all must be extremists and choose violence against the israelis to 
liberate the holy land and palestine against the americans and 
against the enemies of islam to stop them where they are he said 
jana said that gadhafi addressed some 250 moslem clerics 
activists and leaders from 48 countries who went to the libyan 
capital for the seminar sponsored by the world council for islamic 
call and the organization of islamic conference

this religion declares its end its bankruptcy and its inability to 
hold a dialogue to offer and to launch a holy war

the white house on tuesday sent congress the 
legislative package containing presidnet bushs campaign spending 
reforms announced earlier this summer 
bush is proposing to abolish nearly all specialinterest 
political action committees which are the source of millions of 
dollars in campaign funds for congressional candidates 
bushs proposal also would bar personal use of leftover campaign 
funds curtail free mailing privileges enjoyed by congress and do 
away with gerrymandering the drawing of crazyquilt congressional 
districts to benefit certain candidates 
the package also would prevent candidates from rolling over 
campaign funds from one election to the next a practice that helps 
many incumbents scare off challengers 
to infuse more money into the system bush would allow the 
national political parties to spend more on their congressional 
candidates than current election law allows 
bush also wants full public disclosure of socalled soft money 
which refers to funds that are prohibited in federal campaigns but 
permitted at the state or local level in many cases critics 
contend that soft money contributions find their way into the 
federal election process anyway 
in a statement to congress accompanying the package he said his 
proposals were designed to reduce substantially the power of 
special economic interests while enhancing the role of individuals 
and political parties 
on political action committees bush would specifically ban 
federal contributions from pacs sponsored by unions corporations 
and trade associations critics contend that campaign donations 
from these pacs give them undue influence over the votes of the 
congress members who receive them 
bush announced the proposals in june and put them into 
legislative form that he sent to congress on tuesday 
he also has announced his support for a pay raise for congress 
members but has sent no specific proposal leaving that effort to 
congress itself

moslem warlords on tuesday dismissed as 
inadequate proposed political reforms aimed at ending 14 years of 
civil war in lebanon with druse chief walid jumblatt declaring 
the military battle is not over yet 
police said a 3dayold ceasefire that ended six months of 
syrianchristian shelling duels was generally holding with only 
intermittent sniping duels across the dividing green line in the 
capital 
pope john paul ii on tuesday issued the vaticans first formal 
appeal ever to moslems pleading for their help in saving lebanon 
in a separate document he called for a mobilization by 
catholics for lebanon and announced a world day of prayer for this 
wartorn country 
under a peace plan issued by a threeman arab league committee 
lebanons surviving 73 parliament members will meet saturday in 
saudi arabia to discuss the reform plans 
parliament speaker hussein husseini a shiite moslem predicted 
at least 60 lawmakers would participate 
the reforms are designed to give more power to moslems in 
lebanon maronite catholics have dominated the government 
judiciary and army command in lebanon since independence from 
france in 1943 
jumblatt and shiite militia leader nabih berri attacked the 
proposals which were welcomed by other lebanese politicians 
the military battle is not over yet and will not be finished 
on the basis of a new fragile sectarian compromise contained in the 
tripartite committees draft plan jumblatt told a group of 
sympathizers 
berri said in a statement the reform plan was not enough 
the constitution which they want to change gives us more than 
the arab tripartite committees plan for reforms berri 
complained 
under the present system lebanon is governed by a maronite 
president with a sunni moslem prime minister and a shiite 
parliament speaker many government jobs were allocated on the 
basis of a ratio of six christians to five moslems 
at the time the arrangement came about christians formed a 
majority of lebanons population now they are outnumbered by 
moslems 
according to the daily paper annahar the arab league peace 
committee has worked out a plan under which the number of 
parliament seats would be increased from 99 to 128 to be 
distributed equally between moslems and christians 
the reforms would limit the presidents authority in naming and 
dismissing moslem prime ministers and would stipulate that they be 
elected by parliament annahar reported 
the present 99seat parliament was elected in 1972 three years 
before civil war broke out sectarian strife has prevented general 
elections and the house has periodically voted to renew its 
fouryear mandate twentysix vacancies now exist 
a sunni parliament member speaking on condition he not be 
further identified said leaders of the militias and other fighting 
forces are against any settlement because it will strip them of 
the privileges they enjoyed when their men ruled lebanon by rifle

more than twothirds of the senate urged the 
bush administration tuesday to deny any visa request from palestine 
liberation organization leader yasser arafat to address the un 
general assembly 
fiftyeight house members also wrote to president bush 
contending arafat should be denied a visa because he has not lived 
up to his december promises to renounce terrorism and to recognize 
israels right to exist 
the 68 senators 34 democrats and 34 republicans made the same 
point in a letter to secretary of state james a baker iii and 
added 
the plo is on a collision course with the peace process 
arafat and the plo must reaffirm and implement in deed and in 
word the statements of just nine months ago 
rewarding the plo at this time would undercut the peace 
process call into question the seriousness of us antiterrorism 
policy be contrary to american interests and threaten the 
security of israel 
both groups of lawmakers noted that former secretary of state 
george p shultz had denied arafat a visa to address the general 
assembly last november shultz cited a us law giving the 
government the right to deny entry to anyone believed to have 
engaged in terrorism either as an individual or as a member of an 
organization 
arafat has not applied for a visa this year but is widely 
expected to do so the denial of his visa request last year led to 
an uproar at the united nations and an invitation for him to 
address a specially convened general assembly session in geneva 
at a news conference several of the lawmakers who signed the 
letters said their intention was not to derail the dialogue between 
arafat and us diplomats underway since his december pledge 
this is not a message to halt the dialogue but it is a 
message that we want the dialogue to produce results said rep 
mel levine dcalif 
sen connie mack rfla noted that the number of senators 
requesting arafat be denied a visa was 17 higher than the number 
who had signed a similar letter to shultz last year 
this is an indication there is less trust for mr arafat today 
and an indication we believe his words are hollow mack said 
sen pete wilson rcalif dismissed reports that arafat had 
agreed to endorse the terms of a 10point peace proposal initiated 
by egyptian president hosni mubarak

a brief stay in a battered womens shelter 
cant jeopardize food stamp benefits a federal judge ruled 
us district judge harry maclaughlin said the us department 
of agriculture violated its own regulations when it directed a 
cutoff of food stamps for two women this year after they left 
shelters for battered women 
the usda said payments by the state to battered womens shelters 
had to be considered income when calculating the food stamp 
eligibility of individual women who use the shelters 
but maclaughlin ruled monday that the states perday payments 
to 16 shelters around the state should be considered emergency 
assistance not a substitute for the shelter costs that are part of 
a familys welfare grant 
a battered woman does not come to a shelter to find housing 
he wrote she comes because she needs protection from imminent 
physical danger and help in ending an abusive relationship 
the judge said fewer than half of the women who seek shelter can 
be accommodated by existing facilities and the average stay is only 
13 days 
he gave the federal government and the minnesota department of 
human services 60 days to come up with a plan for giving back to 
welfare recipients the food stamps that were wrongfully withheld 
from them while the policy was in effect from aug 1 1988 to 
april 1 of this year 
charles thomas an attorney with southern minnesota regional 
legal services in mankato sued on behalf of the two women from 
that southern minnesota city of about 29000 people 
he said the lawsuit was a class action involving about 2000 
women and children in minnesota who were hurt by the policy the 
ruling requires they be identified and reimbursed he said 
for one of the mankato women the amount was 250 for the 
other 124 thomas said 
while we may not look at the amount as especially significant 
to these women it may mean survival said assistant attorney 
general gail olson olson said the state agreed with thomas 
position that the shelter services should not be considered income 
but was forced to go along with the federal interpretation or face 
sanctions 
there was more at stake here besides benefits said loretta 
frederick director of legal advocacy for the minnesota coalition 
for battered women frederick said the federal policy had the 
absurd result of forcing women to choose between getting their 
children out of an unsafe home or feeding them 
some women were not going into shelters or were leaving shortly 
after getting into them because they could not afford to go 
without food stamps she said

a new california law sets a limit on 
the amount of fat allowed in school lunches and was the result of a 
lawmakers shock at the quality of food served at a school in her 
district 
the law which goes into effect jan 1 requires the state board 
of education to set fat and cholesterol levels for all school 
lunches and orders the board to force the californias 1000plus 
school districts to follow the standards 
the legislation is aimed at highfat lowfoodvalue lunches 
that often serve as the sole source of a childs daily nourishment 
the bill was signed last week by the governor 
im sad to say that for many children the school lunch they 
eat is the most balanced meal they receive all day said 
assemblywoman jackie speier author of the law this is 
particularly alarming when that lunch consists of a corn dog and 
tater tots 
a group called the public voice for food and health policy 
based in washington dc has issued a report that says the 
federal government supplies about a third of the food used in more 
than 24 million lunches served daily at 91000 schools the foods 
include highfat content items such as ground beef pork luncheon 
meat ham butter cheese and eggs 
health authorities generally agree that the daily fat intake for 
school children should be no more than 30 percent of total calories

the chief us negotiator to the superpower 
defense and space talks in geneva said tuesday he hopes the soviets 
will accept a us invitation to visit two star wars research sites 
i would be hopeful that we could work out the arrangements 
in the coming round so that the trip could take place in the coming 
months ambassador henry f cooper told reporters at a pentagon 
briefing 
the negotiator discussed the invitation extended by secretary of 
state james a baker iii in his talks over the weekend with soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in wyoming 
cooper said he intends to press ahead with the offer in the new 
round of geneva talks which begin friday 
cooper said that shevardnadze had reacted positively to bakers 
invitation but that he could not characterize the soviet reaction 
as an acceptance the soviets have resisted such exchanges in the 
past 
it has been our agenda from the beginning to get the soviets 
to talk to us in a direct way about our research activities and our 
testing activities and their research activities and testing 
activities cooper said 
we are hopeful the soviets will accept this invitation it 
was made without conditions we hope it will provide a basis then 
for discussions in geneva that will lead them to accept an exchange 
in the future of such visits he said 
the invitation is intended to promote openness between the two 
nations by allowing the soviets to learn more about us research 
being conducted into the spacebased antimissile defense called 
the strategic defense initiative more commonly known as star wars 
the ussoviet talks in geneva on slashing longrange nuclear 
weapons have been deadlocked over the soviet demand that a treaty 
be contingent on completion of a separate agreement on spacebased 
defenses 
us refusal to end its research into a star wars missile 
defense made an arms reduction accord improbable 
over the weekend in wyoming however the soviets said they 
would no longer insist that curbs on star wars be in place before a 
strategic arms reduction treaty could be reached the start talks 
are also going on in geneva parallel to the space and defense 
talks 
at the wyoming session the us side invited a group of soviet 
experts to visit the los alamos nm national laboratory and the 
trw corps test facility in san juan capistrano calif 
cooper said the soviets would be able to observe at los alamos 
the first particle beam device that was flown in space earlier this 
year and observe at the trw facility the spacebased laser project 
cooper stressed that the us invitation is not contingent on a 
reciprocal invitation from the soviets 
he noted that the soviets have complained about the two research 
sights and the visits would provide the opportunity to gain more 
information about these activities adn build confidence by reducing 
the risk of technological surprises 
cooper said that the invitation was to be extended to soviet 
experts working in the field and that he expected five to 10 
individuals would come if the offer is accepted 
the ambassador said he was convinced the soviets are moving 
ahead with their own research into spacebased defensive system 
i believe they are still working quite deliberately in this 
area he said if they know how to solve this problem 
techically i have personally no doubt they will be moving to 
deploy ballistic missile defenses

citing a lack of evidence a judge 
dropped charges against two reputed leaders of the medellin drug 
cartel accused in the assassination of colombias attorney general 
a newspaper reported tuesday 
elsewhere hundreds of tourists boarded planes buses and taxis 
out of the caribbean city of cartagena after a bomb exploded at the 
hilton hotel there and killed two people 
later tuesday a bomb exploded in a crowded supermarket in a 
northern bogota suburb injuring five people police said the 
bomb tossed by an assailant who escaped in a car damaged the 
front of the carulla market neighboring buildings and a car parked 
nearby police said 
in the five weeks since drug lords declared war on the 
government for trying to crack down on narcotics traffickers there 
have been 111 bombings most of them in this capital medellin and 
cali eight people have been killed by those bombs and 137 
injured according to police statistics 
also tuesday the m19 leftist guerrilla group urged the 
government to pardon drug traffickers and stop extraditing them to 
the united states the statement appeared in a full page ad 
published in the countrys biggest newspaper el tiempo 
el tiempo also reported that in medellin a judge monday dropped 
charges against pablo emilio escobar gaviria and jose gonzalo 
rodriguez gacha alleged leaders of the medellinbased drug 
operation that supplies most of the cocaine in the united states 
the men are on the us justice department list of 12 key drug 
figures wanted for prosecution in the united states the judges 
action would not prevent their extraditions 
a prosecutor told the newspaper he would appeal federal judge 
francisco cardenas decision the associated press could not get 
through by telephone to the judges office in medellin 
escobar and rodriguez who have offered to negotiate with the 
government had been charged with complicity in last years 
kidnapping of andres pastrana who was a candidate for mayor of 
bogota pastrana was freed in an army raid and went on to be 
elected mayor of the capital 
escobar and rodriguez were charged with planning the jan 25 
assassination of colombias attorney general carlos hoyos 
the cartagena bomb was one of the worst to have gone off in 
colombias major cities since drug traffickers and the government 
went to war aug 18 no one claimed responsibility for the bomb 
which went off monday night 
the explosion killed two doctors and wounded a third said the 
chief of the national police in cartagena col luis herrera 
another bomb exploded in front of a cartagena bank monday night 
injuring one person herrera said 
an american businessman with a store in cartagena told the 
associated press tourists were desperate to get out of the city 
the few outbound flights were booked and tourists were jamming 
the airport on a standby basis he said by telephone speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
tourists unable to find space on flights were snapping up 
tickets at bus stations and hiring taxis to take them to other 
cities he said 
cartagena has become popular with canadian and us tourists and 
is a frequent stop for caribbean cruise ships 
the hilton evacuated an estimated 1500 guests to other hotels 
monday night according to the american 
colombian marines and army troops patrolled the city tuesday 
searching cars and frisking pedestrians 
the guerrillas ad published in el tiempo proposed immediate 
negotiations between the government and drug traffickers 
the proposal was not tied to the anticipated signing of a peace 
agreement between m19 and president virgilio barcos government 
the treaty would pardon guerrillas and allow them to set up a 
political party but it has been delayed in the last two days as 
the guerrillas and government negotiators continue to work out 
details 
the guerrillas said in their ad that drug traffickers should be 
pardoned and the government should refused to extradite them to 
united states 
the colombian government and the army have long claimed that 
drug traffickers and many of the estimated 10000 combatants in six 
guerrilla groups in colombia are working together 
the m19 is the only guerrilla group negotiating with the 
government 
m19 took over colombias palace of justice in 1985 the 
takeover and a cannon and machine gun assault by the army left 95 
people dead 
the group was formed in 1970 by dissidents who claimed a 
presidential election that year was fraudulent since then it has 
used assassinations kidnappings plane hijackings and attacks on 
military bases and government installations in its attempt to 
topple the government

israeli officials on tuesday welcomed president 
bushs proposal to eliminate chemical weapons but experts 
suggested the middle east would pose a major problem area for 
putting the plan into effect 
avi pazner a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
israel backed the call for wiping out stockpiles but declined to 
comment on the possibility of doing so within 10 years as bush 
proposed 
israel supports very much the banning of all chemical 
weapons he said 
we have warned many times that arab countries are arming 
themselves with such weapons and have in some cases used them 
against civilian populations 
pazner noted iraq and iran used chemical weapons during the 
8year persian gulf conflict and reports also surfaced of syria and 
libya manufacturing them 
a foreign ministry spokesman speaking on condition of 
anonymity said israels position is that we are totally against 
stocking or using chemical weapons and any action that leads to the 
suppression of chemical arms is welcomed and supported by israel 
we hope that there will be a worldwide movement so that all 
these weapons will be destroyed and never put to use again 
bush proposed monday that america would eliminate all of its 
chemical arms within 10 years if the soviet union and other 
countries do the same 
israeli military analyst aharon levran a retired army brigadier 
general said arab countries probably would balk at giving up 
chemical weapons that they saw as a counter to israels reported 
nuclear capability 
he also suggested arab countries may attach political 
conditions such as israeli withdrawal from lands captured in war 
with arab states 
israel has never confirmed it but foreign reports say israel 
has nuclear and chemical weapons as well as longrange missiles 
capable of delivering them 
israel is considering nationwide deployment of protective masks 
to counter the eventuality of chemical weapons civil defense 
authorities are conducting a yearlong trial in which 3000 
residents of two towns were given such masks 
israeli soldiers have been equipped with modern protective 
masks and suits as well as detection and decontamination equipment 
iraq is known to have chemical weapons including mustard gas 
and the nerve agent sarin it used mustard gas against enemy 
soldiers while fighting iran and against civilians in kurdistan 
according to an assessment by levran and members of an israeli 
research group 
syria has extensive stockpiles of chemical weapons including 
the nerve gas sarin the report said libya also is believed to 
have poison gas egypt also has stockpiles of poison gas according 
to the report by the jaffee center for strategic studies in tel 
aviv 
levran said he doubted iraq would heed bushs call 
the iraqis are afraid that one day the iranians will amass the 
forces and overrun them he said

leftist rebels attacked 
government forces in scattered raids in nine provinces tuesday and 
military officials said 39 soldiers and guerrillas were killed 
the rebels have agreed to peace talks and a communique said 
tuesdays actions were in response to government repression 
the communique broadcast on the rebels clandestine radio 
station called the attacks a halt the repression offensive 
and said it was ordered because of the arrests of dozens of 
unionists 
military officials said guerrillas attacked targets in nine of 
el salvadors 14 provinces they listed the casualties as 26 
guerrillas and 13 soldiers killed and 18 soldiers 15 guerrillas 
and 6 civilians wounded 
it was the broadest rebel offensive since may 10 when the 
guerrillas attacked positions in 10 provinces and it was the first 
series of coordinated attacks by the guerrillas since government 
and rebel representatives held preliminary peace talks in mexico 
city sept 1315 
an 11day ceasefire declared unilaterally by the rebels ended 
sunday 
the rebel communique spoke of the fascist brutality of the 
rightist government of president alfredo cristiani referring to 
accusations by detainees that they were tortured and raped last 
week at national police headquarters 
it said in part just as we have been flexible and broadminded 
in order to negotiate we are likewise completely disposed to and 
capable of accompanying the struggle of the entire people 
the document was signed by the five main rebel commanders 
including joaquin villalobos and schafik handal took part in the 
mexico city peace talks 
another round of negotiations is to take place in costa rica 
oct 1617 
cristianis government has denied the allegations of brutatlity 
and said it acted legitimately against the unionists because 
participants in their march last week burned two buses 
all but 18 of the 71 unionists detained had been released by 
tuesday those still in custody have been charged with terrorism 
subversive activity and illegal association 
the rebel communique also accused the government of taking 
advantage of the guerrilla ceasefire to move troops into 
rebelcontrolled areas and to bombard civilian zones in the north 
and east 
a 10yearold civil war between the marxistled farabundo marti 
national liberation front and a succession of usbacked 
governments has taken an estimated 70000 lives with most of the 
victims civilians

a defense company two former executives 
and a defense consultant pleaded guilty tuesday to bribing a marine 
corps official in a scheme to get electronic contracts worth 77 
million 
whittaker command and control systems a whittaker corp 
subsidiary agreed to pay 35 million in fines and penalties for 
its part in the scheme to bribe marine corps contracting official 
jack sherman 
guilty pleas were also entered by scott m lamberth former 
president of the whittaker subsidiary john f van tassel the 
operations director of its fayetteville ark facility and san 
diego defense consultant donald illeman all three men agreed to 
cooperate with the fbis continuing investigation dubbed 
operation ill wind 
a federal grand jury investigating the case meanwhile indicted 
defense consultant thomas e muldoon and another former whittaker 
command executive leonard l ingram on charges of participating 
in the same bribery scheme 
muldoon targeted by investigators as an important figure in the 
case and ingram were charged in the 16count indictment with 
conspiracy bribery and interstate travel in aid of racketeering 
in its guilty plea the company admitted funneling more than 
80000 to sherman between 1982 and 1988 through three defense 
consultants including illeman the scandal stemmed from the 
awarding and expansion of contracts to provide electronic 
components for a battlefield air traffic control system 
the guilty plea by whittaker command and control systems is the 
third by a corporation in the continuing investigation of pentagaon 
procurement fraud that has resulted in convictions of more than 20 
officials consultants and businessmen 
teledyne electronics and hazeltine corp have both pleaded 
guilty for their roles in the procurement scandal 
according to a company lawyer and court papers whittaker corp 
officials were unaware of the bribery scheme which began when the 
subsidiary was a private company called lee telecommunications 
the bribery scheme was conceived in 1981 when lee 
telecommunications started having financial troubles according to 
court papers filed in the case in us district court 
whittaker corp acquired lee telecommunications in 1986 later 
merging it with another subsidiary to form whittaker command and 
control systems lamberth and ingram were stockholders of lee 
telecommunications and became respectively president and vice 
president of the whittaker subsidiary 
lamberth 59 deliberately hid the bribery scheme from officials 
of the parent company after the acquisition the court papers said 
the board of directors and the present officers of the company 
do not have firsthand knowledge of he facts whittakers 
attorney daniel h bookin told us district judge claude hilton 
no one who is involved in those activities is currently with 
the company bookin said but the corporate officers see 
sufficient evidence to conclude that a guilty plea is appropriate 
sherman who received an 18month prison term for taking other 
bribes helped lee telecommunications get a 600000 contract in 
1982 to build computers for the battlefield trafficcontrol system 
he subsequently authorized several modifications that increased its 
value to more than 26 million according to court papers 
he also increased the value of another contract from 540000 to 
36 million by authorizing additional work sherman later 
authorized the transfer of a 16 million worth of additional 
computer software work to lee telecommunications from a firm that 
could not perform its contract 
lamberth faces a possible 20year sentence and fines up to 
500000 for his guilty pleas to conspiracy and bribery 
illeman 64 and van tassel 53 could each be sentenced up to 
15 years and fined 250000 for their pleas to bribery charges 
hilton scheduled sentencing for lamberth and van tassel on dec 
15 and for illeman on jan 12 
the indictment charged that the company paid more than 200000 
to muldoon illeman and another defense consultant john marlowe 
who is cooperating with the government to share with sherman 
ingram is accused in the indictment of submitting after the 
ill wind investigation became public a phony invoice to the 
marine corps to obtain reimbursement for 30000 paid to illeman 
who told investigators he shared part of it with sherman 
muldoons attorney albert ahern jr said his client refused a 
government offer to plead guilty and will fight the charges in 
court muldoon denies it all denies there was any criminal 
intent on his part at any time ahern said 
ingrams attorney marcus topel vowed to fight the charges in 
court i think this is a classic case of guilt by association 
the san francisco lawyer said i think the trial will show he had 
absolutely nothing to do with any of these wrongful activities and 
at most was present at various times when they were discussed and 
did nothing further than that

hill has repeatedly refused to comment on the allegations 
michael marks hills lawyer urged justices not to suspend him 
saying that his reputation has suffered irreparable harm 
at most justice hill was guilty of misjudgments said 
marks after 28 years in service to this court and to the 
judiciary this is the blemish of his record the blemish on which 
some people may remember him 
hill was found guilty last week of ethics violations he was 
also found guilty of intimidating state attorney general jeffrey 
amestoy by personally delivering a letter to him urging a criminal 
investigation of jane wheel be speeded up 
wheel was then an assistant judge an elected official who helps 
presiding superior court judges she pleaded no contest to 
allegations of judicial misconduct and faces a jail term for her 
perjury conviction in a separate proceeding 
as a retired justice hill could have been asked to preside over

rheinmain air base west germany ap veterans of the berlin 
airlift on tuesday commemorated the crews who daily flew tons of 
supplies to break a soviet blockade of germanys former capital 
that ended 40 years ago 
among the 350 people attending the ceremony were former us 
navy and army air force teams who risked their lives ferrying food 
to west berliners during the 462day soviet blockade that began on 
june 26 1948 
at least 79 aviation crewmembers lost their lives during the 
dramatic airlift that ended on sept 30 1949 after 23 million 
tons of food and lifesustaining equipment were dropped into the 
city surrounded by what is now east germany to keep 2 million west 
berliners nourished and warm 
it would take about 20 hours to fly here in a c54 recalled 
former navy pilot al jones of phoenix wed land in 
newfoundland the azores then on to rheinmain west germany to 
get here 
jets now make the flight in onethird that time 
no other event shows the turning point of germanamerican 
relations as impressively as the berlin airlift said wilhelm 
knittel deputy west german transportation minister at the 
memorial ceremony 
with the aid of the united states of america and through the 
strong will of the berliners to remain free the city became a 
symbol of freedom in the world knittel said 
tommy tomlinson a 92yearold former us navy captain laid a 
wreath at the foot of rheinmains airlift memorial a large cement 
monument pointed in the direction of berlin 
tomlinson of silverton ore is the oldest surviving berlin 
airlift pilot and was in charge of us navy squadrons vr6 and vr8 
based at rheinmain during the airlift 
some pilots rose to fame during the dramatic 15month airlift 
like retired air force lt col gail s halvorsen known as the 
candy bomber for his idea of dropping raisins and sweets to 
berlin children but the airlift was a success because of the 
involvement of thousands behind the scenes 
i was a store keeper in charge of ordering parts to repair and 
help keep those airplanes flying said 68yearold ellis dickson 
of cupertino calif as he watched the ceremony we worked a lot 
of long hard hours doing it 
the reunion of former airlift crews was organized by the airlift 
associations in frankfurt and west berlin

the federal aviation administration is 
extending its deadline for air carriers to submit plans for 
antidrug programs including random testing of employees 
officials said tuesday 
faa spokesman fred farrar said 22 of 130 carriers using planes 
capable of carrying more than 30 passengers have failed to submit 
their plans orginally due aug 18 a federally mandated antidrug 
program for the aviation industry takes effect dec 18 
the new deadline for submitting proposals is oct 9 farrar said 
he said just over 100 companies using smaller planes have 
submitted proposals for implementing the program which requires 
employment postaccident and random drug testing 
faa officials said it is difficult to tell how many of the 
estimated 3000 smaller aviation companies might be covered by the 
law since it covers only those with more than 50 employees 
the agency has sent letters to hundreds of companies warning 
them that it will take legal action if they fail to meet the oct 9 
deadline 
the faa recognizes that since this is a new requirement and 
involves comprehensive planning and implementation the airline 
industry has faced numerous difficult tasks in developing antidrug 
plans the faa letters say 
airlines that fail to comply face penalties of up to 10000 for 
each day their plan has not been submitted farrar said no fines 
will be assessed until after the new deadline 
the faa has 60 days to approve each companys plan

supporters of president bushs clean air bill 
defeated an attempt tuesday to make it require auto exhausts 
cleaner than those now in force in smogplagued california 
the tough provision proposed by rep henry a waxman dcalif 
was defeated by voice vote in the house energy and commerce 
environment subcommittee he chairs 
the subcommittee is considering amendments to bushs legislation 
to clean the skies of ozone acid rain and airborne toxic chemicals 
the outnumbered waxman who is closely allied with environmental 
organizations accepted defeat without a roll call saying he 
wanted to avoid forcing members to take a public position against 
stringent automobile controls 
waxman promising to return with a compromise that still would 
toughen bushs auto requirments said sometimes you dont want 
them on record so they can rethink their position and come 
around 
rep norman f lent rny ranking republican on the parent 
committee and the main gop sponsor of the bush legislation said 
waxmans proposals would have cost consumers an extra 500 per car 
if fully implemented for model year 2000 for that expense he said 
pollution under waxmans plan would only be cut an additional 27 
percent compared with the bush legislation 
estimates of the cost of current auto emissions contols have 
clustered around 1500 per car in recent years 
lent said the technology doesnt exist to meet the waxman 
standards which he said represented the dreams of the authors 
and have no basis in technological fact 
whatever happens in the subcommittee the battle over auto 
standards is expected to surface again in the full energy and 
commerce committee and the house floor the senate has not yet 
begun work on clean air legislation 
motor vehicles are a major contributor to ozone pollution in 
some areas the principal contributor through the emission of 
unburned fuel vapors they also emit oxides of nitrogen and carbon 
monoxide 
ozone the prime ingredient of smog is produced by the reaction 
of hydrocarbons unburned fuel and nitrogen oxides in the 
presence of sunlight and heat because of its ozone problems 
california has tougher auto pollution standards than the rest of 
the nation 
waxmans plan would have limited hydrocarbon emissions to 025 
grams per mile the standard for california starting in 1995 
from 1993 through 1999 and 0125 grams per mile after that 
outside california cars are limited to 041 grams per mile under 
current law 
nitrogen oxides which also contribute to acid rain would have 
been capped at 04 grams per mile from 1993 through 1999 down from 
1 gram now and 02 grams after 1999 
waxmans proposed limit for carbon monoxide was 34 grams per 
mile from 1992 through 1999 the current standard and 17 grams 
afterwards 
the administrations proposed standard for hydrocarbons is 025 
grams per mile by 1998 for nitrogen oxides 07 grams by the same

about 130 east german refugees out 
of about 1200 camped out in the west german embassy garden left 
the compound tuesday to accept an offer of guaranteed emigration 
within six months of returning home 
but refugees estimated that about 120 newcomers scaled the 
embassy fence tuesday new refugees arrived while people boarded 
buses to leave at the other end of the compound 
east german emissary manfred vogel said those willing to return 
could emigrate without facing prosecution for flight from the 
republic and other offenses 
the 130 or so refugees left the embassy in two buses and private 
cars and spokesmen said an additional 100 intend to follow them 
wednesday 
the flow of east german refugees into poland also increased 
tuesday with some camping out on streets near the west german 
embassy in warsaw uncertain where they would spend the night the 
number of refugees appeared to have risen to more than 400 people 
newcomers registered with west german officials at a kiosk near the 
embassy staffed by a member of the diplomatic staff 
on the austrian border with hungary authorities said tuesday 
that the number of east germans crossing into austria since hungary 
opened its borders for them stood at 21424 tuesday morning about 
950 more than the day before 
from austria the east germans rapidly proceed to west germany 
which offers them immediate citizenship 
czechoslovakia is between west germany and hungary 
refugees said east german emissaries in prague would hold two 
sessions wednesday to submit their offer for more people to vacate 
the west german mission and go home 
all east german citizens who announce themselves ready to leave 
the bonn embassy receive a piece of paper to serve as a document 
for them to cross the east german border without trouble at two 
checkpoints 
spokesmen for the refugees who took part in the negotiations 
said vogel issued a written guarantee which was handed over to west 
german government officials taking part in the talks 
the guarantee reportedly stipulates the right to emigrate within 
six months after returning to east germany 
even while vogel conferred with the refugees newcomers arrived 
most of them families with children 
the embassy in warsaw crowded with refugees was closed last 
week to prevent more people from entering at least some of the 
newly arrived east germans were told to fend for themselves monday 
evening in finding a place to sleep 
part of the overflow was absorbed by a former seminary at 
tarchomin just outside warsaw lent by roman catholic church 
officials to the west german authorities there the number of east 
german inhabitants was up to 152 on tuesday compared to just 16 a 
week ago according to occupants 
the back of the seminary looked like a parking lot in dresden 
with more than 20 vehicles mostly east germanmade wartburgs and 
trabants 
the streets around the embassy in the warsaw residential 
district of saska kepa also contained east german cars some with 
license plates removed as a symbol that their owners did not plan 
to return to east germany

federal investigators looking into the crash of 
a usair jet said tuesday that almost all the tread on the front 
tires was gone but there was no indication the wheels had jammed 
the finding about the front wheels would be consistent with the 
pilots statements that he had tried o bring the jet to a halt 
before it skidded off the runway into the east river on sept 20 
said ted lopatkiewicz a national transportation safety board 
spokesman 
two people were killed and 59 others were rescued from the water 
after the pilot aborted takeoff of flight 5050 at laguardia airport 
although 95 percent of the tread on the front tires was gone 
the main landing gear under the wings looked normal lopatkiewicz 
said the wing flaps were all in normal takeoff position 
investigators reported earlier that the front wheels were locked 
sharply to the right indicating that the pilot had turned the 
tiller to counteract a drift to the left 
capt michael w martin told investigators that he aborted the 
takeoff because the aircraft was moving left and he felt and heard 
a strange vibration 
investigators planned to look inside the engines of the boeing 
737400 for additional clues to the cause of the crash 
john j santucci district attorney for the borough of queens 
who has launched a grand jury investigation of the pilots conduct 
said monday that urine samples taken two days after the accident 
contained no sign of drug or alcohol use by the pilot or copilot of 
flight 5050 
martin and his copilot constantine kleissas were criticized by 
federal officials for failing to submit to testing immediately 
after the crash although they are not legally required to do so 
medical experts said alcohol would usually not show up in urine 
samples taken two days after ingestion although drugs such as 
marijuana or cocaine probably would

less than 1 percent of the 15352 random drug 
tests conducted on transportation department employees have turned 
up drug use according to a department report released tuesday 
of the 15352 tests conducted jan 1 1988 through april 30 
1989 there were 99 positives for drug use according to the 
drugfree workplace program evaluation report for september 
1989 announced by melissa j allen of the transportation 
department 
marijuana use accounted for approximately twothirds of 
positives with cocaine accounting for all but a small percentage of 
the rest the report says 
the total cost for the departments drug program in fiscal 1988 
which ended last sept 30 was over 4 million covering 
collection laboratory testing staff support and informational 
services according to the report 
federal aviation administration employees accounted for 95 
percent of those tested under the random testing program which 
focuses on safety and security personnel whose actions have a 
direct and immediate impact on the public health and safety the 
protection of life and property law enforcement or national 
security 
of these socalled category 1 employees 65 percent are air 
traffic controllers 16 percent are electronic technicians 4 
percent are air traffic assistants 3 percent are aviation safety 
inspectors and 12 percent hold other jobs 
a total of 92 percent of supervisors and 72 percent of the 
employees tested who were surveyed later by the department said 
their individual privacy was protected during the specimen 
collection process 
however comments on the questionnaire also spoke to isolated 
instances where specimen collectors acted in an unprofessional 
manner and employees felt the collection process was conducted in a 
degrading manner the report says noting that customs service 
employees who have been subjected to drug tests also have 
criticized contractors conducting the tests 
in addition to the widespread random testing the department 
also conducted reasonable suspicion testing postaccident testing 
and followup testing 
there were only 17 reasonable suspicion tests departmentwide 
from jan 1 1988 through april 30 1989 and they resulted in 
eight verified positives for drug use according to the report 
at the same time there were 26 postaccident drug tests in the 
faa and two in the us coast guard and all were negative 
in followup testing 105 employees who had been identified as 
using an illegal substance were subjected to a total of 659 
followups and these tests found 26 verified positives or 
approximately 25 percent of the employees the report says 
regarding the random testing the report concludes that random 
selection of employees has been accomplished but many employees 
do not appear to fully understand the random selection process and 
therefore are skeptical of its validity there seems to be an 
impression that selection of specific individuals drives the random 
selection process 
the report says the process selects facilities on a random basis 
with names of employees also listed in random order and that the 
departmental drug office was developing an informational videotape 
to outline the process for employees 
drug program personnel meanwhile are questioning whether the 
department could achieve the same level of deterrence with less 
than a 50 percent annual random sample and the report calls for 
the drug office to assess what level of random testing would be 
best

salman rushdie isnt the only writer living in an 
islamic community who faces threats intimidation and de facto 
censorship the pen international writers association said tuesday 
alexander blokh pens international secretary said a writer 
with an islamic background can be in a very free city and yet 
he lives in a very permanent state of terror discreet terror 
the association holding its world congress in toronto 
recommended its member chapters invite writers from the islamic 
community to discuss such situations their causes and the means to 
find a solution 
we would ask them to come and very discreetly tell us their 
story if they want to blokh said at a news conference 
blokh said pen learned about such cases in paris and london as 
it prepared protests of the death sentence by iran over the 
bestselling novel the satanic verses which sent rushdie into 
hiding the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini ordered rushies death 
in february saying islam was slandered by the book 
he said he also knew of one similar case of pressuring a writer 
in moscow 
im not going to tell you any concrete cases because they are 
still quite secret blokh said 
he said only the rushdie case was known to have official 
status issued by a government but other incidents of 
religious fanaticism could be considered a new threat to 
freedom of expression that had not been anticipated at the end of 
the 20th century 
the known cases consist of pressures intimidation sometimes 
direct threats against islamic writers in english and french 
blokh said he said the new form of censorship discovered only 
recently was something for which were not prepared 
the threats were coming not from a government but from a very 
hard to define community he said 
the recommendation on intolerance and fanaticism as translated 
by the ap from a french copy said the rushdie incident is not 
isolated and revealed many other pressures happily less grave on 
writers that may stem from diplomatic family community religious 
or terrorist sources 
the pen conference moves wednesday to montreal before concluding 
friday it is the associations first meeting in north america 
since a heavily publicized 1986 new york event 
pen founded in 1921 has 11000 members in more than 60

the killers of us drug agent enrique 
camarena salazar each will be sentenced to an average of 150 years 
in prison in the next two months mexicos attorney general said 
tuesday 
enrique alvarez del castillo conceded that numerous judicial 
delays had occurred since rafael caro quintero and 28 others were 
convicted in the camarena case but said sentencing now was 
expected in november 
we mexicans are convinced drug trafficking can only be beaten 
through effective and energetic international action he said in 
a statement one week before president carlos salinas de gortaris 
first official visit to the united states 
with drug trafficking a major item on the usmexico agenda 
alvarez outlined mexicos progress 10 months into salinas term 
salinas is due to meet president bush in washington and speak 
before congress 
alvarez said more than 8000 people have been arrested on drug 
charges almost 22 tons of cocaine base have been seized 
enforcement and training has been toughened and laws have been 
changed to increase prison time for narcotics violators and corrupt 
officials 
he said funds to investigate and prevent drugrelated offenses 
were increased 133 percent to more than 50 million he noted that 
15 mexican drug enforcement agents were killed on duty in the last 
10 months 
us officials have praised the salinas administrations 
efforts one official called last aprils arrest of miguel felix 
gallardo named as a drug kingpin nothing less than a miracle 
the 1985 killing of camarena a us drug enforcement 
administration agent who was working in guadalajara has been a 
sensitive issue 
alvarez defended the caro quintero prosecution saying it was a 
complex case that involved numerous drug traffickers in answer to 
questions he said sentences would average 150 years in prison 
but gave no details 
camarena and his mexican pilot were kidnapped on feb 7 1985 
their bodies bearing signs of torture were found a month later on 
a ranch 60 miles southeast of guadalajara 
alvarez said mexico was working more closely than ever with the 
united states on such issues as tracing laundered drug money and 
drug lords assets 
however he said allowing hot pursuit of suspected drug 
traffickers airplanes across the border was a stupid 
discussion the united states would not permit such a violation 
of sovereignty and neither would mexico 
alvarez said salinas ordered him to make a public report on the 
administrations antidrug efforts he denied that mexico was 
putting on a show in advance of the meeting with bush 
this is not a show nor is there anything in the slightest 
theatrical about this said castillo who was sitting on a podium 
surrounded by 63 tons of cocaine in thousands of white and brown 
packages 
the cocaine had been seized in the last two months alvarez 
said most of it along the usmexico border 
alvarez said he did not know if increased enforcement efforts 
had reduced the flow of drugs to the united states 
we only know how much we seize alvarez said we dont 
really know how much gets through 
drug use in mexico is still very low compared to the united 
states alvarez said but prevention and rehabilitation programs 
are also being reinforced 
alvarez said it will be two or three months before the effect of 
the crackdown on drug cartels by colombia in the last month can be 
known he said there had not yet been any visible effect on the 
amount of drugs in the pipeline

prime minister yitzhak shamir said tuesday that 
acceptance of the egyptian peace plan would be tantamount to a 
surrender to the arab uprising 
shamir in a speech in jerusalem said there is no reason for 
israel to surrender and accept the intefadeh uprising as 
victorious and the plo as landlord over part of the land of israel 
what has been proposed to us today is to go to cairo to talk 
to the intefadeh leaders and the heads of the plo about the 
shortest path toward a palestinian state shamir added 
it was one of shamirs harshest criticisms of egypts 10point 
peace plan which has caused tension in israels coalition cabinet 
between shamirs rightwing likud bloc and the leftleaning labor 
party after labor accepted it in principle 
labor head and finance minister shimon peres said tuesday his 
party thinks we now have a most important chance for advancing 
the peace process we should not miss this opportunity just 
because some people think party considerations prevail over those 
of state 
meanwhile ehud olmert the cabinet minister responsible for 
arab affairs said tuesday that israel should consider imposing the 
death penalty for security offenses in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
olmert told reporters in jerusalem that he believed the 
palestinian uprising was continuing because the punishments 
applied until now are not deterrent enough and therefore maybe 
we should consider perhaps somewhat harsher punishment 
asked what he would recommend he said capital punishment 
olmert also described israeli prisons as too comfortable and 
said hard labor might be one of the harsher conditions that 
should be considered 
also tuesday the body of a 30yearold palestinian was found in 
the west bank town of nablus a day after he was kidnapped by masked 
arab youths palestinian reporters said 
they said hani emil salfiti an ambulance driver was apparently 
strangled after being accused of being an informer for the shin bet 
secret service reporters said 
the army confirmed the death and said it was investigating 
salfitis death raised to 121 the number of palestinians killed 
by fellow arabs as alleged collaborators with israel since the 
start of the 21monthold uprising in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
israeli soldiers and civilians have killed 574 palestinians in 
the revolt and 40 israelis have died in the violence 
meanwhile four arabs were reported shot and wounded tuesday in 
stonethrowing clashes with troops in gaza arab hospitals reported 
the army had no immediate reports of casualties in gaza 
a district court in the southern town of beersheva on tuesday 
sentenced shimon efrakh a jewish settler from neve dekalim in 
gaza to seven months in suspended sentence for shooting to death 
an arab girl 
intissar atar 17 was killed on nov 10 1987 by an accidental 
shot from efrakhs pistol fired after palestinian girls in the gaza 
strip stoned a car in which efrakh and other settlers traveled 
israel radio said 
the verdict pointed out that efrakh had no intention of causing 
death and that regular criminal punishment considerations could 
not apply in this case 
the court also sentenced 22yearold ezad mahmud shabban of gaza 
to life in prison tuesday for the aug 4 slayings of two fellow 
palestinian prisoners for allegedly collaborating with israel 
the egyptian initiative advocates trading occupied territory for 
peace and calls for preliminary israelipalestinian talks in cairo 
the palestinian delegation would include two arabs deported by 
israel to represent palestinians in the diaspora 
the united states has welcomed egypts initiative designed to 
sidestep israeli objections to plo participation in the talks 
israel considers the plo to be a terrorist organization 
shamir has rejected any modification of israels own initiative 
which calls for palestinian elections to select representatives for 
talks on limited autonomy 
shamirs aide avi pazner denied that shamirs rejection of the 
proposed cairo meeting contradicted earlier statements that he was 
willing to meet with palestinians to arrange elections 
the prime minister has no problem meeting palestinians 
pazner said the issue is that egypts initiative wants us to 
meet with plo people 
the polishborn shamir whose family died in the holocaust 
compared suggestions that israel talk with the plo to europes 
attempted appeasement of nazi germany in the 1930s 
they made great efforts to prevent a war with germany and its 
nazi leadership said shamir but the results were far worse 
then the first world war it seems that to us the lesson is clear

wally floody whose tunneling expertise enabled 
76 fellow allied officers to break out of an escapeproof nazi 
pow camp portrayed in the film the great escape has died 
after a lengthy illness he was 71 
floody a world war ii spitfire fighter pilot died in a 
hospital monday 
his son brian reported he had chronic lung disease partially 
due to the tunneling he did during the war it only got severe 
during the past several years 
a royal canadian air force officer floody was 23 when his plane 
was shot down over france in 1941 
he used his mining experience from kirkland lake ont to 
engineer and dig the 350foot tunnel out of stalag luft iii floody 
designed the lighting ventilation and electrical systems it took 
at least 400 prisoners to dig the tunnels 
the camp then holding about 1500 captured officers was 
supposed to be escapeproof but 126 prisoners broke out on march 
24 1944 and 76 escaped 
floody said the 50 who were recaptured were shot 
floody himself was not among those who made it to freedom he 
was transferred from the camp two weeks before the breakout 
of the 76 officers who fled the camp only three eventually made 
good their escape 
floody remarked in a 1986 interview every time i tell my wife 
i might have been one of the prisoners who got away she reminds 
me yes but you might have been one of the ones they shot 
he served as a technical adviser for the 1963 movie the great 
escape starring steve mcqueen james garner and charles bronson 
his son brian said the presentation of his father in the film 
was sort of a composite role 
brian noted that some people said that since the tunnel king was 
played by bronson that must have been based on his father 
dad never said it specifically he said 
floody often served as lead digger and passed buckets of gravel 
back to the men working in the tunnels which were named tom dick 
and harry 
the dirt was dumped surreptitiously into the camps gardens 
on several occasions floody was trapped in caveins and was 
pulled out by his heels 
the germans found tom dick was abandoned harry became the 
escape route 
floody was a prisoner until the war ended he returned to canada 
and began a business career in toronto 
besides brian he leaves his wife elizabeth and another son

canada must grapple again with tensions between 
its english and frenchspeaking populations after quebecs 
provincial election showed continued support for the separatist 
parti quebecois 
there also was a surprising vote in mondays election for a new 
equality party formed by englishspeaking canadians irate over 
quebecs language policies that favor french 
although quebec premier robert bourassa led his liberal party to 
almost as large a majority as it won four years ago it lost some 
support to the revitalized parti quebecois and the equality party 
the provincial assembly will have 92 liberal deputies 29 from 
the parti quebecois and four from equality 
in the december 1985 election the liberals ousted the parti 
quebecois which had been in power for nine years and won 99 of 
the then122 seats in the assembly 
they said the idea of an independent frenchspeaking quebec 
was dead it is alive a jubilant jacques parizeau said monday 
night he led an internal parti quebecois struggle last year that 
placed it back on a policy of eventual independence 
just months ago it appeared the parti quebecois faced extinction 
but under parizeau it won 40 percent of the popular vote monday 
the percentage was a slight increase from 1985 and was similar 
to the vote in a 1980 referendum when the provinces electorate 
defeated the parti quebecois policy of separatism 
parizeau won a seat in the quebec assembly and is expected to be 
a strong leader of the separatists 
he calls for control to be gradually taken away from the federal 
government over quebecs family language cultural social and 
development policies with a provincial referendum to be held on 
each issue 
a constitution then would be drafted for quebec and it would be 
submitted to a vote 
parizeau has offered no timetable for his plan 
prime minister brian mulroney a native of quebec and leader of 
the progressive conservatives told reporters in ottawa tuesday 
that the parti quebecois has had steady support since the 1970s and 
mondays balloting didnt change that 
he was asked if he was concerned and replied the answer of 
course is no not at all the progressive conservatives and 
liberals are canadas largest political parties 
about 81 percent of quebecs 65 million people speak french 
while english is the dominant language in the countrys nine other 
provinces 
bourassa said the election monday was a truly decisive 
victory for the liberals and confirms the confidence of the 
majority of quebecers in the federal regime 
but the wins by the equality party will make it more difficult 
for bourassa to maneuver between the french and englishspeaking 
sentiments in the province 
quebecs liberals traditionally count on support from the 
englishspeaking minority and the equality party drew from that 
source 
in december bourassa refused to allow more than a token change 
in provincial laws restricting commercial signs to the french 
language his compromise allowed bilingual signs only indoors with 
the frenchlanguage portion significantly larger than the english 
robert libman leader of the equality party was happy with 
mondays results and in a speech delivered in english and french he 
said 
a significant segment of quebecs population who share a 
vision of canada and quebec now have the political representation 
that they need the english and french must speak to one another

the senate passed two longdelayed spending 
bills tuesday as a 13day partisan standoff began to ease while 
the house braced for a looming budget mess by approving legislation 
to keep the government in business next month 
on an 8911 tally the senate approved a 144 billion foreign 
aid measure for next year that would provide 45 million in 
assistance to polands new noncommunist government it then voted 
8119 for a 1574 billion bill for labor health and education 
programs containing slightly liberalized abortion rules 
across the capitol the house voted 274152 to send the senate a 
bill pumping enough money to federal agencies to let them function 
through oct 25 the vote came just five days before the start of 
the new fiscal year 
the senate had completed debate on the two spending bills last 
week but votes on final approval were delayed while democrats and 
republicans held private talks on rival proposals to beef up the 
governments efforts against illegal drugs those negotiations 
neared completion tuesday 
the assistance to poland provided by the foreign aid measure far 
exceeded the 10 million president bush has proposed making 
available the measure would also boost us military aid to el 
salvador by 5 million to 90 million 
under the eased abortion rules women who are pregnant because 
of rape or incest would qualify for federal aid to pay for 
abortions expanding the current criteria by which such assistance 
is paid only when a mothers life is in danger 
the bill would also withhold some federal aid from states that 
do not require the notification of people whose spouses have aids 
both bills cant be sent to bush for his signature until the 
senate and house work out resolve their different verswions of each 
final action on an 119 billion transportation bill was 
withheld as party leaders work out final details of an antidrug 
package passage of a 672 billion measure for veterans housing 
and space programs was also postponed while lawmakers considered 
bolstering it with aid for communities hit by hurricane hugo last 
week 
congress has sent president bush just one of the 13 annual 
spending bills for the new fiscal year even though they are 
supposed to be completed by oct 1 the start of fiscal 1990 
the rest of the measures have been slowed by congress earlier 
distraction with the problems of former house speaker jim wright 
dtexas its work on an emergency spending bill for this year and 
the question of how much money the government should spend battling 
the drug problem 
missing deadlines for approval of spending bills is nothing new 
for congress when lawmakers finished all 13 of the measures for 
1989 one minute before midnight last sept 30 it was the first 
time they had done so in 12 years 
because of that during tuesdays brief house debate on the 
temporary spending bill the ranking republican on the house 
appropriations committee rep silvio conte of massachusetts 
suggested a new version of auld lang syne for the new federal 
fiscal year 
should all deadlines be forgot and never met on time conte 
told his colleagues 
the temporary spending measure has the support of the bush 
administration lawmakers hope that by the time it expires they 
will have completed work on the remaining 12 spending measures

most automotive speed machines come in 
colors other than passionate pink but no one laughs when john 
mitchell arrives in his magenta plymouth valiant duster 
the 1970 chrysler product with a rare model of engine may be 
worth several times its price paid back in those days when a car 
could be had for under 3000 
the paint name is magenta nicknamed panther pink said 
bruce friar of anderson who helped mitchell restore the original 
sheen 
we had to call the manufacturer and get the formula they 
only painted 12 originally and being the kind of car it is its 
extremely rare 
the number of these classic pink muscle cars yet remaining could 
probably be counted on one hand mitchell says his which has just 
40000 miles on it may be the only one thats been completely 
restored 
a friend of mine who deals in highperformance cars said 
that its worth at least 15000 to 20000 and said if its the 
only one you could probably name your price mitchell said 
not that its for sale said mitchell who has worked for 
chrysler corp in new castle for 23 years 
im probably going to hang onto it he said id hate to 
get rid of something and not know what its worth

gangrelated fighting broke out among more 
than 300 prison inmates tuesday and guards fired shots to break it 
up officials said one inmate was killed and four others were 
wounded 
altogether more than 20 people were injured in the disturbance 
at the maximumsecurity menard correctional center including two 
guards prison authorities said 
the disturbance began in the dining hall and spread into the 
south cellhouse and the west cellhouse of the centuryold prison 
said illinois department of corrections director michael lane 
the disturbance certainly was gangrelated and considering 
the nature of the gangs here it had definite racial overtones 
lane said 
lake said 21 inmates were injured and eight were hospitalized 
most with stab wounds one inmate was killed said lane who 
arrived at the scene shortly after the fight broke out around noon 
two staff members also suffered injuries he said 
eric freeburg spokesman for chester memorial hospital said 
later that nine inmates were brought to the hospital four had 
gunshot wounds he said 
lane said guards fired as many as 50 shots in breaking up the 
disturbance which involved from 300 to 325 of the 700 menard 
inmates who were out of their cells at the time 
most of the shots were warning shots fired into the air lane 
said he would not specify whether guards fired directly at 
inmates but prison spokesman nic howell said the slain inmate was 
shot to death 
he identified the dead inmate as james bailey 34 of chicago 
who was serving time for two counts of attempted murder 
howell was asked if the guards killed the inmate and injured the 
four others we dont know that for a fact he said we would 
presume so 
howell said authorities would investigate where the gunshots 
came from he noted however that prison officials hadnt 
recovered any guns that were not to be there 
the prison in southern illinois was locked down and howell said 
everything was under control 
howell said the inmate population at menard was 2539 at the end 
of last week thats 74 percent more than the prison was designed 
to hold he said

a mother jailed for more than two years in a 
bitter child custody dispute said tuesday her daughter is fine and 
she is proud of her 
dr elizabeth morgan who was released from the district of 
columbia jail on monday said her daughter hilary is not only all 
right she is more than all right 
two years ago she was a terrified traumatized victim of 
incest morgan said on wusatv today she is a proud happy 
girl who knows she is worth protecting and i am very proud of 
her 
morgan was jailed in august 1987 after she failed to produce 
hilary now 7 for a supervised courtordered visit with her 
father dr eric foretich morgan claims foretich sexually abused 
the child foretich has repeatedly denied the allegation 
morgans release was the result of a law passed by congress and 
signed by president bush last week limiting civil contempt jail 
terms in the district of columbia to 12 months the law expires 
after 18 months 
foretich appearing tuesday on abcs good morning america 
program said he was glad morgan was out of jail 
i only wish this could be coupled with some concern for my 
missing daughter i would have been in support of that bill if the 
bill had a provision mandating a government agency such as the fbi 
be required to find my daughter foretich said 
morgan has declined to reveal the girls whereabouts 
at a news conference late monday morgan said that for the 
immediate future she would spend time with her fiance federal 
appeals court judge paul r michel 
i will go wherever my fiance takes me morgan said when 
michel was asked about his plans for the couple he only smiled and 
shook his head 
id rather not say michel said 
morgan said she wanted a thick steak salad and a bottle of red 
wine 
oh i suppose ill get my hair cut my teeth cleaned the 
kinds of things i havent been able to do for the past two years 
she said beyond that i cannot say 
morgan credited a groundswell of grassroots support with 
creating the climate for the drafting of the congressional 
legislation that ultimately freed her 
i am very happy and very grateful for those who backed me 
and stayed with me morgan said they made the difference

afghanistans anticommunist guerrillas 
disappointed that ussupplied munitions dwindled when soviet 
forces left their country wonder if americans have lost interest 
in backing them to victory in their freedom struggle a guerrilla 
commander said tuesday 
i am sorry to say some kind of mistrust has arisen 
brigadier rahmatullah safi told a group of reporters the feeling 
now among the afghan people and their guerrilla supporters is that 
americans are very good people but they leave you in the middle 
of the road instead of showing friendship to the end 
the end of the road for the guerrillas and several million 
afghan refugees still waiting in neighboring countries will be 
victory in the form of a legal moslem government acceptable to the 
people of afghanistan to replace president najibullahs communists 
ruling in kabul he said 
the interruption of us ammunition and weapons supplies just as 
the soviets beefed up the kremlininstalled afghan government in 
kabul caused military setbacks and loss of confidence but at the 
moment there is no problem in the supply we are satisfied with 
the continuation said safi visiting washington for talks with 
us officials 
he is currently head of intelligence for the national islamic 
front of afghanistan one of the more moderate of seven guerrilla 
groups trying to achieve unity under the framework of the 
usbacked afghan interim government the us government has said 
it will back the interim government in efforts to oust the 
najibullah regime while also searching for a political solution 
on early us visits while his homeland was still occupied by 
the red army we were met by congressmen rich people who would 
take you to their private homes doctors for our wounded he 
recalled today he said there is still fighting in afghanistan 
there are lots of wounded but no doctors interested no 
hospitals 
as for najibulla he will not survive said safi 
it was unrealistic however for us officials to predict 
najibullahs quick collapse in kabul or seizure by the guerrillas 
of the town of jallalabad in eastern afghanistan he said it is 
foolish to give a timetable general eisenhower general montgomery 
never gave timetables he said naming successful us and 
british commanders of world war ii

soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze on tuesday condemned violence by national movements 
and liberation struggles and said noble ends do not justify violent 
means 
he did not praise the palestinian struggle against israeli 
occupation of captured arab lands in his speech to the general 
assembly and the message to the palestine liberation organization 
and other movements was unmistakable 
freedom must not be sought at the expense of others 
no support or sympathy should be extended to the socalled 
movements that allow actions humiliating other nations or use 
terrorist barbaric and inhuman methods in waging their struggle 
it was the most explicit renunciation yet of violence by groups 
which moscow has supported in the past from those in africa to 
the middle east 
the time has come finally to realize that not all means are 
good for attaining even the most noble ends the international 
community condemns and outlaws terrorism 
we need equally determined action against any kind of 
violence whatever the motives or excuses for it he said 
shevardnadze did not discuss specific conflicts but emphasized 
the importance of international cooperation and moral behavior by 
all nations and groups 
he addressed condemnation of violence in his speech even before 
disarmament and acceptance of president bushs call to slash 
chemical weapons stockpiles 
diplomats said it signified a greater soviet commitment to live 
up to its words about norms of international civilized behavior and 
common human values 
they also cited soviet desire to improve relations with israel 
and to seek a comprehensive settlement in the middle east 
violence by the state against its own people must be ruled out 
altogether shevardnadze said violence on national ethnic or 
religious grounds must no longer be tolerated 
we advocate freedom of choice 
however we reject its interpretation as a license to use any 
means to commit any violence or to shed blood 
shevardnadze admitted moscow was disappointed by the setback of 
the polish communist party but said we are in no way 
prejudiced against the new government led by noncommunists 
we wish it every success and are ready to cooperate with it 
we see nothing threatening in the fact that a coalition 
government has been formed in accordance with the will of the 
polish people 
he said that if tolerance is mandatory for us in our attitude 
toward the current government of poland why are others so 
intolerant as regards say cuba 
it was a clear reference to us dislike of cuban communist 
leader fidel castro 
in his first address since he became japans foreign minister 
last month taro nakayama explained the new activist foreign 
policy of his government tuesday including a greater nonmilitary 
role in un peacekeeping worldwide 
nakayama also said japan would welcome simultaneous or separate 
un membership for both south and north korea and said tokyo was 
trying to improve its own relations with pyongyang 
he said japan seeks to improve its relations with moscow and 
resolve the issue of the sovietoccupied northern territories 
nakayama said recent events in china disturbed the japanese 
a reference to the violent suppression of a studentled democracy 
movement in june but he said japan expects chinas policies of 
reform and openness to remain unchanged 
nakayama announced that japan is prepared to provide 600 
million from 1990 to 1992 to help the poorest countries in 
subsaharan africa and elsewhere restructure their economies 
as japan interacts with the rest of the world more intensively 
and in a broader spectrum of fields he said it realizes that 
it must play a more active role in international affairs

an immigration official had a change of 
heart tuesday and decided to release on bond a 27yearold 
student from china who was detained when she arrived seeking 
asylum her attorneys office said 
david ilchert regional director of the immigration and 
naturalization service earlier ruled against bond for hoy yu yi 
after a doctor reported her to be in good health but later ilchert 
had a change of heart said hoys spokesman bob ryan the 
regional director is the only person who can approve bond in 
immigration cases 
federal immigration judge bernard hornbach suggested the checkup 
last week after a hearing in which hoy appeared pale grimaced and 
said she was suffering from severe ulcerlike symptoms 
hoy and her fiance luo jian guang 32 were taken into custody 
aug 7 when they arrived in san francisco saying they feared 
reprisals for antigovernment protests if they return to their 
homeland immigration officials have the right to detain 
asylumseekers who arrive without visas or to release them on bond 
while the ins said it has not taken a position on the asylum 
request the state department has filed a report saying it does not 
believe the students have proven they have a wellfounded fear of 
persecution if they go back to china 
their attorney eugene wong of san francisco said he will 
continue to fight deportation and pursue bond for luo he said hoy 
has relatives with whom they could stay 
president bush decided after the beijing massacre in june to 
allow the estimated 73000 chinese students in the united states to 
remain even if their visas expired but that decision did not 
affect people who arrived later 
hoy and luo were studying in tokyo when they helped organize a 
rally deploring the june 4 massacre of hundreds perhaps thousands 
of people by government troops on their way to recapture tiananmen 
square from prodemocracy students 
they said chinese embassy officials in tokyo took pictures of 
them and they received phone calls at home that threatened them 
for their protest 
both students fathers were jailed during the cultural 
revolution in the 60s and they testified last friday that they 
expect to be jailed if they return to china

the democraticcontrolled senate on tuesday 
endorsed an additional cut of nearly 300 million in president 
bushs star wars program as part of a 288 billion military 
spending bill 
by a vote of 6634 the senate rejected an amendment that would 
have restored that sum to bushs star wars program to meet the 45 
billion total approved by the chamber in its authorization bill 
passed in august 
instead the senate accepted a total for the strategic defense 
initiative that falls about 900 million short of bushs request 
for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
the spending bills total is about 41 billion 37 billion 
for the pentagons sdi program and 355 million for the energy 
department and military construction 
the senate accepted those totals on a voice vote and continued 
debate on the bill which was expected to take several days 
sen james exon dneb a member of the armed services 
committee who voted against restoring the 300 million said 
there isnt any question that suport for sdi is extremely 
weak in the senate 
later the senate rejected 7129 an amendment that would have 
cut 27 billion from bushs request for 47 billion next year to 
buy and test the first 13 models of the b2 stealth bomber 
proponents of the batwinged aircraft argued that a ussoviet 
treaty reducing strategic arms would be impossible without the 
plane opponents complained that the cost of 530 million for each 
of 132 planned bombers was excessive 
during a session that lasted late into the night the senate 
approved by a vote of 6534 a nonbinding resolution calling on 
bush to report to congress before april 1 1990 on the us 
militarys presence in south korea sen dale bumpers dark had 
proposed a reduction of 3000 in the 43800 us troops stationed 
in the asian nation but the sense of congress measure was 
adopted instead 
earlier in the day the senate overwhelmingly endorsed shutting 
down 86 military bases and scaling down five more approving the 
costsaving plan to close bases the vote was 8614 
the senate totals for star wars are still far more than what was 
approved by the house 31 billion and the house has not 
compromised on the issue according to one senate negotiator 
its now clear that the house is not about to accept the 
number that the authorizers agreed to in our bill said sen alan 
dixon dill a member of the senate armed services committee 
the defeated amendment sponsored by republican sens john 
warner of virginia and malcolm wallop of wyoming also included a 
series of changes to the bill approved by the appropriations 
committee 
warner and wallop would have restored 910 million for the 
submarinebased longrange trident 2 nuclear issile reduced funds 
for the apache helicopter and earmarked 395 million for 
conventional weapons such as stinger tow and harm missiles 
the defeated amendment also would have reduced the money for 
fast transport ships from 1 billion to 20 million and provided 
money for one rather than two icebreakers 
on star wars wallop had argued that the increase in the 
substitute amendment would have provided barely a minimum to 
sustain confidence in the program 
the house according to wallop funded it at a level which it 
cannot succeed what they are doing to the american people is lying 
to them 
but sen daniel inouye dhawaii said the amount for star wars 
was a prudent position considering the current status of that 
program and sen bennett johnston dla noted that the soviets 
this past weekend indicated that they were divorcing star wars from 
any ussoviet treaty to reduce strategic arms 
the soviets are not so concerned about sdi anymore johnston 
said 
in other action the senate approved 
transferring 135 million from the defense department to the 
energy department for the restart of the three tritium reactors at 
the savannah river nuclear plant 
providing 20 million in military assistance for jordan this 
amendment was introduced at the request of bush and approved by 
voice vote 
approved aid to repair and rebuild military facilities in the 
caribbean and united states damaged last week by hurricane hugo 
the total cost of the aid plan was not immediately available but 
sen ernest hollings dsc the plans sponsor said that 50 
million was for a navy shipyard in charleston and 25 million was 
for shaw air force base 
on base closings the senate approved an amendment that 
effectively eliminates a provision that would have held up 300 
million for the base closings until the general accounting office 
certified that the savings exceeded the cost 
a federal commission in making its recommendation last 
december estimated a savings of 56 billion over 20 years then 
defense secretary frank c carlucci accepted the panels plan and 
the house last spring upheld the proposal 
the senate action on the measure sponsored by sen sam nunn 
dga chairman of the senate armed services committee came 
despite appeals from a handful of members petitioning on behalf of 
their homestate bases 
prior to the senate action defense secretary dick cheney said 
further cuts in the defense budget by the democraticcontrolled 
congress may force him to close more bases 
given all the demands to redirect dollars from the defense 
budget to other areas ive got no choice but to find ways to close 
additional bases cheney told reporters the day after senate 
democrats and the administration reached a tentative agreement to 
boost president bushs antidrug effort by 900 million the plan 
requires a cut of about 13 billion in the pentagon budget 
in te debate over base closings sen daniel inouye dhawaii 
argued that a mistake had been made and the provision simply asks 
that the comptroller general analyze 
sen alan dixon dill who has fought plans to close chanute 
air force base near rantoul ill charged that the commission

for everything there is a season particularly 
tv for us viewers the season noisily began last week full of 
ceaseless drumbeating store tieins and the newest twist clips of 
new shows on airline flights 
that is a far cry from the way they do things overseas 
an associated press survey of four nations great britain 
japan mexico and bahrain shows that the new tv seasons in three 
of these countries make the us version seem a september epic in 
bloat 
in the fourth mexico there is no television season as such 
new programs are introduced on a seemingly random basis with the 
dominant entertainment form the telenovela the mexican soap 
opera 
few shows are from north of the border although viewers can and 
do watch us entertainment and news programs on cable 
depending on which networks theyre watching japanese viewers 
get two new tv seasons each year one starts in early october the 
other on april 1 
they also face seasonstarting fanfare for the programs most of 
which are domestically produced few american shows air for long in 
prime time and usually are consigned to latenight slots examples 
of these include night rider airwolf and macgyver 
as in the united states new programs are played up in tv and 
newspaper ads and japanese networks sometimes assemble stars of 
new shows for variety or quiz shows that constitute a preview of 
the coming season 
but this hoopla is small in scale its nothing comparable to 
the megabuck watchus campaigns of the american networks 
there is a fall tv season in britain but unlike the american 
version which began on sept 18 the british season starts 
politely there is no designated kickoff day and theres none of 
the massive promotion that attends the arrival of the new season in 
the united states 
american shows still are in the minority in this seasons 
british schedules which still lean to the important and serious in 
programs or programmes as they spell them there 
no matter that one new british entry on bbc2 the young 
ones makes fox broadcastings racy married with children 
seem like noel coward according to some observers 
you want serious the bbc has on its fall schedule a show called 
art in the third reich while another outlet channel 4 the 
most arty of britains channels plans a sixhour version of the 
mahabhrarata a dramatization of the indian poem about the 
creation of mankind 
but not all is staid at the bbc it has one homegrown attempt at 
lowbrow this season challenge anneka in which the very blond 
and enthusiastic anneka rice clad in a jumpsuit takes on 
viewersuggested challenges each week 
and it has american shows its adding spenser for hire and 
police squad to its fall roster which already has cagney amp 
lacey shes the sheriff and in the late night the elderly 
the jack benny show and the honeymooners 
channel 4s fall roster like others in britain also has its 
share of yank shows among them st elsewhere kate and 
allie happy days i love lucy and the old abc 
miniseries north and south 
there are four tv seasons in tiny bahrain where the government 
runs two channels one englishlanguage the other arabic the 
seasons include one during the moslem holy month of ramadan when 
the emphasis is on religious programming 
but none of the four seasons start with any fanfare in fact 
viewers have to make a determined effort to learn when and which 
programs are on 
there is plenty of western programming fare which has included 
even cbs lonesome dove and hbos campaigntrail spoof 
tanner 88 
but the most popular shows are primetime soaps like knots 
landing falcon crest and the most popular dynasty 
however all air without the steamy sex scenes to which american 
viewers are accustomed 
because of religious law in bahrain these scenes are cut thus 
viewers may see a man and woman approaching each other nostrils 
flaring then see them talking of other matters 
theres an absence of soap opera on bahrain tv now replacing 
them in the current season is programming that mainly is geared to 
school students 
the soaps wont be back until the start of the next new tv 
season in january

in the beginning there were no sticker prices on 
windows of new automobiles and the public was confused about 
prices so the federal government mandated stickers and people 
became more confused 
these people saw millions of lookalike cars on the highway but 
they had difficulty finding two in the showroom with identical 
stickers thats because cars came with a myriad of options and 
the dealer might have added more 
those addons added up and some of them were very peculiar 
sufficiently so to befuddle the potential buyer to the 
manufacturers suggested retail price were added charges that 
included freight preparation and even advertising 
well the wary buyer thought this is the way you do business in 
cars and who am i to buck the system but he continued to wonder 
isnt that a bit peculiar i dont buy my tvs ovens refrigerators 
or even my house that way 
the buyer discovered that many of the options werent options at 
all they were already on the car and he discovered there were 
more to come after agreeing to buy the car he learned it wasnt 
well equipped for the elements 
that being so the salesman advised the buyer to consider the 
paint and internal protection package rustproofing and an extended 
warranty isnt it foolish he was asked to buy a new car and not 
protect it 
then came the financing the customer could finance through the 
company or he could try for his own the complications rose should 
he take out a lower cost longterm loan or a higher cost shortterm 
loan 
it was enough to confuse a computer and the insurance was yet 
to come what to insure who to insure how much to insure after 
failing to comprehend his warranty the buyer had no energy left to 
read the insurance policy 
having gone through this maze a couple of times however the 
potential car buyer felt a growing sense of mastery it might have 
taken a decade or so but he had caught on to the ways and manners 
of carmakers and their dealers 
then came belowmarket interest rates and rebates those prices 
stamped to the car window confusing to begin with meant even less 
now because cars werent selling for those prices you had a 
choice rebate or low interest 
well it might have seemed that simple but when you went to the 
dealer you found that only certain cars were discounted and those 
werent the ones you wanted and you found that the low low 
interest rates didnt apply uniformly 
you went home to work it out which should i take rebate or 
lowinterest loan which would leave me ahead of the game should i 
finance through my bank or the company longterm or shortterm 
should i take out credit insurance to cover repayments on the 
chance i might be injured 
wising to the ways of the marketplace you loved to see 
companies get into competition with each other especially near the 
end of the selling season when they had to get rid of the old 
inventory before introducing new models 
like now 
you bided your time worked out the figures in advance and 
prepared yourself to pounce on the best deal available after all 
you said carmakers have already announced price increases for the 
following year 
well its true they did raise prices but maybe they didnt 
mean it one of them general motors already has announced 
discounts from the higher prices on some of its new modelyear cars 
even before the selling season begins 
this has produced a situation in which the new higherpriced 
cars might possibly be available at less than the prices pasted on 
the older lowerpriced cars put that in your computer and see 
what comes out 
right now some analysts of the automotive industry think that 
chrysler and ford will join gm in discounting but of course each 
company will have its own special formula for you to endlessly mix 
match and compare at your leisure 
nobody tries to look far into the future of anything economic 
today since the footing keeps shifting and distorting the 
perspective but you should be aware that if competition 
intensifies the new terms might have to be revised

six months of syrian shellings have 
killed millions of fish in the mediterranean off this christian 
enclave near beirut and threatened one of lebanons few natural 
resources a government ecologist says 
the shellings stopped with the recent ceasefire in the battle 
for beirut but damage to the fish population and the livelihoods of 
local fishermen remain critical 
our sea is dying ecologist pierre malichev of the health 
ministry said in an interview its become rotten and polluted 
our marine life is nearing its end and we have no fish for next 
year 
he estimated that along with the millions of fish killed 
billions of their eggs also perished 
malichev said fish not killed by the hundreds of exploding 130mm 
howitzer shells and salvoes of rockets were poisoned by tetryl one 
of the explosive elements in the shells that is released into the 
water 
the shellings also forced most of the enclaves 500 fishermen to 
remain ashore 
but about 75 of them risked going out after dark to gather the 
thousands of fish that would float up dead on the surface after 
each shelling 
after a heavy round of shelling the dead fish float like a 
carpet on the surface fishermen sirop ornakian said before the 
ceasefire took effect 
we usually wait a bit and then head for the carpet most times 
i collect about 25 kilograms 55 pounds of fish every trip 
the syrians shelled the 28mile coastal enclave and its waters 
to keep cargo ships and tankers from running a blockade with 
supplies for the christian forces of gen michel aoun in the battle 
of beirut 
the shelling has killed our season said kivork manoukian a 
fisherman for more than 40 years usually this time of the year 
is the best for us when we make some money but this years been 
catastrophic 
his friend arten khishkhishian said he gave up fishing because 
his nets were torn by twisted rocket casings and lumps of shrapnel 
littering the shallow waters off jounieh and the ancient port of 
byblos a few miles north 
ive had to repair my net three times and that cost more than 
100000 pounds 200 he said i decided to stop this 
shrapnel fishing until theres lasting peace 
but the others risked their lives and their boats 15foot craft 
powered by outboard motors to haul in the dead fish sometimes a 
syrian barrage would come unexpectedly police said several 
fishermen were wounded 
kevork manoukian said that on one night it looked quiet so i 
dropped my net 
then the next minute a shell hit about 100 meters away from my 
boat he said i ditched my net and made it for the shore in 
panic as more shells exploded around me 
ornakian and other fishermen went out regularly for catches not 
much bigger than those they were netting before the fighting 
with fish in short supply in the enclave the price has doubled 
to the equivalent of about 450 a pound 
ornakian and the others reckon that the money they made from 
each trip the equivalent in lebanese pounds of about 250 was 
worth the chance 
moslem fishermen are banned from the waters off beirut where 
the syrians deployed batteries of longrange artillery along the 
waterfront to shell the christian coastline 
but the moslems are able to fish south of beirut for 50 miles 
down the coast to the ancient port of tyre where the biggest 
danger they face is an occasional israeli gunboat

ty miller who plays a character called the 
kid on abcs the young riders says that although he grew up 
with horses he was more interested in motorcycles 
hes in the saddle every day now for this new western series 
about the founding of the pony express miller plays the central 
character of six young men in the show who sign up to carry the 
mail from st joseph mo to sacramento calif in april 1860 
the shows original title was the kid 
i ride but i dont ride very well said miller who grew up 
in southern california in a family that ran a christmas tree 
business we always had horses but its like when you have a 
swimming pool and you spend your time at the beach i spent more 
time riding motorcycles than horses we had 2 acres and a stable 
the horse i rode is now 26 and cant be ridden anymore 
miller and all the members of the cast were sent to cowboy camp 
for a quick course in how to stay in the saddle it was run by 
richard lundin head wrangler for the series 
im finding you just have to get on a horse and ride and 
ride miller said its not a textbook thing in the pilot we 
only used stunt men for a few shots they did the dangerous falls 
we did all the flatout riding 
miller was more concerned with going to tucson ariz to film 
in 100degree weather in his leather costume his character and 
costar stephen baldwins character william cody later to become 
famous as buffalo bill wear buckskin 
this is the first western for miller who appeared as bellhop 
eric lloyd in the final season of abcs hotel 
my role on hotel was pretty limited he said mostly i 
stood in the lobby and said good morning how are you may i take 
your bag those of us who worked in the lobby werent involved in 
the main stories 
miller acknowledges the the young riders series takes 
license with the facts for dramatic reasons 
they keep most of us around the station more so than would 
happen in real life he said thats for the sake of the 
stories well say there isnt a mail pouch to take out i think 
the riders spent more time on the road 
pony express riders usually averaged 75 miles changing horses 
at relay stations every 10 to 15 miles occasionally a rider was 
required to ride a longer distance there were 80 riders to cover 
1966 miles in 10 days the service ended in october 1861 with the 
completion of the telegraph from coast to coast 
not one rider was killed and only one mail pouch was lost 
miller said 
he describes his character in the series this way the kid is 
very honest and trustworthy hes the moral center of the group 
hes levelheaded kind of reserved he doesnt act on impulse 
hes the natural leader of the riders 
miller grew up in los angeles his mother was an artist and his 
father ran the christmas tree business 
my brother runs the business now he said its the 
largest christmas tree retail business in the country we sell two 
million trees a year on 52 lots from san diego to sacramento 
miller himself appeared headed for a business career when a 
girlfriend at the university of california urged him to audition 
for a commercial he went to 40 auditions before he got his first 
job a silent part in a commercial for a canned ham after that he 
did guest roles on such shows as growing pains our house 
valerie and macgruder and loud 
miller was the last one cast in the young riders he read 
for the role five times and it was down to miller and another actor 
before he was approved 
like the virginian his character has no name hes known 
only as the kid 
im thinking about what ill do if it comes up that i have 
to sign my name he said i guess ill just put down an x

cuddled in her fathers arms 
3yearold masuma khan emerged from the belly of a huge military 
cargo plane and gingerly raised her deformed weblike left hand 
damaged when soviet warplanes bombed her house in afghanistan 
masuma a shy child dressed in a native outfit is among the 
most recent group of afghan war victims brought to the united 
states for medical treatment under a program operated by the 
defense department private volunteers and doctors who donate their 
time and expertise 
after landing at this base outside washington just minutes 
before president bushs air force one touched down on the same 
tarmac masuma and nine other afghans were taken in a bus to the 
base hospital there they sat on beds intrigued by the small 
television sets at the side 
they spent one night at andrews before scattering to hospitals 
around the country 
with her father abdullah masuma flew to newark nj where 
doctors were to operate on her hand which healed improperly after 
it was burned in a fire at her house she is expected to stay three 
months before returning pakistan 
other compatriots went to chicago wilmington del columbia 
ohio jamestown ny baltimore and jacksonville fla 
said mir 22 who walks on crutches as the result of a gunshot 
wound he suffered two years ago might have to undergo a bone graft 
in flint mich his destination but simply arriving in the united 
states buoyed his spirits 
i feel nice the darispeaking mir said through an 
interpreter as he sat down to a meal of chicken potatoes and 
carrots served with plastic utensils that some refugees found 
unnecessary 
since the afghan airlift began in march 1986 825 wounded 
afghans have been flown out of neighboring pakistan for treatment 
in the united states europe japan and egypt about half have come 
to the united states 
i think its really been a successful program said rep 
bill mccollum rfla who worked on the legislation that set up 
the program 
the airlift works in conjunction with the pentagons use of 
military transport planes to fly surplus goods into pakistan for 
delivery across the border to anticommunist rebels in afghanistan 
the planes deliver supplies and then on their return are 
loaded with injured afghans who are tended to by military medical 
teams 
some 10 million was allocated to the pentagons humanitarian 
office for the program in the 1989 fiscal year an amount that is 
expected to be duplicated in the coming year 
the work of finding hospitals and families to care for the 
wounded afghans falls to the intergovernmental committee for 
migration an international nonpolitical group that deals with 
refugees the group has a contract with the us government to run 
the afghan program 
patients are carefully screened and must meet specific criteria 
they must be warwounded afghan refugees who cannot get the 
treatment they need in pakistan and who do not suffer from 
communicable diseases they generally need reconstructive or other 
complicated surgery 
fran sullivan who handles the afghan account at the commitee 
said hospitals in the united states sometimes use the afghans as 
teaching cases because doctors dont often see the kinds of war 
wounds suffered by the refugees 
typically an afghan receives up to 35000 in free medical care 
in the united states 
to place the wounded at hospitals and in homes for their 
rehabilitation the committee seeks help from groups formed to 
support the afghan rebels and from members of congress interested 
in the issue they include sen claiborne pell dri gordon 
humphrey rnh and charles wilson dtexas 
during convalescence the afghans stay with local residents 
often moslems who understand their cultural needs such as dietary 
rules against eating pork 
the big problem facing the committee these days is the shortage 
of hospitals agreeing to take the patients sullivan said there 
are roughly 450 afghans in pakistan who have been approved for the 
program and are awaiting placement 
one reason for the backlog is the decline in interest in the 
afghanistan issue in the united states sullivan said since the 
soviets withdrew their troops from afghanistan last year many 
americans say wait a minute i thought that war was over now 
the usbacked guerrillas are battling the sovietsupported afghan 
government of najibullah 
once they have been treated some afghans are not keen to return 
to pakistan where they typically must rejoin the 3 million afghans 
in primitive refugee camps along the border their status however 
is not changed by their stay in the united states

marlon brando returns to the screen in a dry white season 
after a lamentable nineyear absence the notsogood news is that 
he appears on the screen less than 10 minutes 
yes he looks bulky resembling raymond burr in his courtroom 
robe yes he affects a british accent how he loves props that 
drew an initial titter from the preview audience but no the 
brando magnetism has not diminished in his long layoff he remains 
a dominating force 
like cry freedom and a world apart a dry white 
season was filmed in zimbabwe and looks at south africas 
apartheid from a white viewpoint the central figure is donald 
sutherland a teacher at an exclusive white boys school he is 
vaguely unsettled by the signs of oppression all around him and by 
the tacit agreement with the governments policy by his family and 
fellow faculty members 
apartheid strikes close to sutherland when his sons playmate 
and the boys father are kidnapped tortured and murdered by the 
special police he enlists the help of the shadowy zakes mokae a 
taxi driver with good connections susan sarandon a liberal 
reporter and a noted defense lawyer played by brando 
sutherlands efforts to seek justice are thwarted and he loses 
his job his wife his standing in the white community and more 
even his own daughter betrays him only one element of hope 
remains he has inculcated his young son with a sense of outrage at 
the vicious repression of the south african regime 
the surehanded direction of euzhan palcy sugar cane alley 
and her talent for drawing the best from actors infuse a dry 
white season with suspense despite the inevitability of the 
outcome she is superb at the handling of action scenes such as the 
massacre of children at soweto focusing on individual human 
tragedy her only annoying technique is the use of extreme 
closeups especially on minor characters 
sutherland is perfect as the rational man whose growing fury at 
the regimes atrocities forces him to take action equally 
effective are janet suzman as his icy unsupportive wife susan 
sarandon as the fearless reporter and jurgen prochnow das 
boot as the embodiment of evil as the special police officer 
the african actors bring substance and authenticity to the film 
especially zakes mokae as sutherlands underground source and 
winston ntshona as the murdered boys father both are south 
african exiles who have brought the antiapartheid message to the 
london and new york theaters 
in brandos two scenes he reemphasizes his position as the 
most exciting film actor of his time lets hope that his recent 
announcement of another retirement was another brando prank 
the mgmua release was produced by paula weinstein and is rated 
r for language and brutal action running time 106 minutes

how much you enjoy the 1982 comedy baby its 
you may depend on your appreciation of three alumni of new 
jerseys working class frank sinatra bruce springsteen and 
director john sayles 
the year is 1967 and jill rosen rosanna arquette is a senior 
at a trenton high school an aspiring actress from an uppermiddle 
class family who seeks acceptance to sarah lawrence college 
she catches the attention of albert sheik capadilupo the 
swaggering sharply dressed garbage mans son who ranks jesus 
christ frank sinatra and me as the most important people in his 
life 
on the surface another bad boy meets nice girl story sheik 
gets jill sheik loses jill sheik wins her back but baby its 
you has much more to offer with humor and intelligence sayles 
touches on the conflicts of class and sex what to do with choices 
too many and too few 
sayles matewan eight men out collaborated on the 
story with amy robinson whose experiences were closer to jills 
certainly i could relate to both of them sayles said in a 
recent phone interview a lot of kids ended up in vietnam or 
working in a factory or married with kids right out of high school 
your potential is cut off 
rock n roll from the trashmen to procul harem is everywhere 
but sinatras strangers in the night frames this video its 
heard three times in a diner by the jersey shore at the high 
school senior prom and at the sarah lawrence dance that closes the 
film with a bewildered pyschedelic band honoring the request of 
sheik and jill 
theres definitely a line running through sayles said 
one of the fascinating things was looking at all the different 
songs that came out around that time strawberry alarm clock 
motown the rolling stones there were so many kinds of music 
sinatra and springsteen are sheiks theme music he glides 
through high school to springsteens hard to be a saint in the 
city mouths sinatra songs at a rundown miami nightclub and races 
up to sarah lawrence and a final reconciliation with jill as 
springsteen grinds out adam raised a cain 
jill gets a little bit of everything pouting like diana ross as 
she mimes the supremes stop in the name of love joining her 
friends in a lighthearted chorus of going to the chapel and 
walking arminarm with sheik to ben e kings stand by me 
the films happy ending is possible only through an acceptance 
of limits jill fails miserably in her attempt to impress her 
sophisticated sarah lawrence friends sheiks miami nightclub act 
is a washout 
he has to realize that hes not frank sinatra and she learns 
to take a little control over reinventing herself sayles said 
whats nice about baby its you is you get a chance to tell 
about other peoples stories amy and i were talking about how the 
girls and guys in school always wanted to know what went on in the 
other lockerroom this gave each of us a chance to do that

lassus missa osculetur me gimell the tallis scholars 
directed by peter phillips 
lassus masses and motets nimbus christ church oxford 
cathedral choir directed by stephen darlington 
 
it was after solving the case of the brucepartington plans that 
sherlock holmes completed his monograph on the polyphonic motets of 
lassus experts according to dr watson rated it the last word 
upon the subject 
its unlikely that lassus motets will ever be exhausted he 
composed 700 or so of which only a few dozen have been recorded 
in addition to his 60 settings of the mass 101 settings of the 
magnificat plus hundreds of madrigals and chansons 
born in 1530 lassus was perhaps the most popular composer of 
his time he not only wrote a lot of music he wrote well as two 
new recordings prove 
the choir of christ church cathedral offers two mass settings 
three motets and a madrigal 
the missa venatorum barely 10 minutes long shows lassus at his 
most economical the kind of music that might elevate the mind 
without aggravating the knees 
technically the oxford choir cannot match the tallis scholars 
professional polish but it is closer to the sound lassus would 
have known 
the missa osculetur me recorded by the tallis scholars 
illustrates lassus frequent technique of musical parody in this 
case the mass reworks his own motet set to the opening verses of 
the song of solomon let him kiss me 
the performances are ravishing which is to say that they are up 
to the scholars usual mark is it peevish then to complain that 
the disc holds only 49 minutes of music encore mr phillips 
encore

southside mercury texas 
 
the scottish band texas lives about as far from its namesake as 
one can get but it has ambitions as large as the lone star state 
texas new album southside is one of the most promising 
debuts of 1989 texas shows a remarkable amount of maturity and 
selfassuredness for such a young band and what southside 
lacks in originality it makes up in consistent quality 
the quartets sound like so many other mainstream rockers these 
days is rooted in the acoustic guitar of frontwoman sharleen 
spiteri but its augmented by the distinctive blues guitar of ally 
mcerlane and the sort of throbbing bass thats more common to 
synthesizer bands 
those ingredients are most evident on i dont want a lover 
this records first single thats not the best song on the album 
however the vote here goes to thrill has gone an understated 
countryflavored tune about the souring of a relationship 
at times mcerlanes guitar and the wide open spaces of texas 
sound bring the state to mind spiteri also understands well the 
differences between singing and shouting 
her lyrics travel the traditional terrain of relationships with 
neither great insight nor embarrassing simplicity 
texas sometimes follows the traditional tendency of young bands 
to show their influences a little too openly texas obviously 
listens to bob dylan since the musical hook of everyday now 
vividly recalls i shall be released and the ringing guitars of 
fool for love sound a lot like u2 
but this record is filled with strong melodies and performances 
there are no weak cuts a track record that would make most young 
bands as well as too many established ones envious

the first exhibition to probe the artistic 
dialogue between pablo picasso and georges braque during the years 
they collaborated on cubism has opened at the museum of modern art 
it is perhaps the most important art event of the season for 
cubism was possibly a vision that could only have succeeded with 
the collective creativity of the two masters 
we were like mountain climbers roped together braque 
recalled 
almost every evening either i went to braques studio or 
braque came to mine each of us had to see what the other had done 
during the day picasso once said 
picasso and braque pushed art beyond its traditional scope to a 
pure abstraction through cubism which utilized cubes and other 
geometric shapes to create forms the two changed modern art 
the exhibition includes 390 works in all mediums used by both 
picasso 18811973 and braque 18821963 the works are on loan 
from collections in moscow leningrad paris london stockholm 
prague and basel and were also taken from the museum of modern 
arts own collection 
in addition to the picassobraque exhibition here is a list of 
other shows this season at some museums and galleries in the united

the blond giant stood tentatively on the stage 
of the place des artes theater seemingly amazed at the standing 
ovation accorded him by the packed audience 
max von sydow had come to the montreal world film festival for a 
tribute to his 30year career that has brought distinction to 
movies on both sides of the atlantic the program included clips 
from two widely divergent films ingmar bergmans the virgin 
spring 1959 and hannah and her sisters 1986 
a dialogue with the actor was followed by a screening of the 
danishmade pelle the conqueror which drew the motion picture 
academys best foreignlanguage film oscar of 1988 as well as a 
nomination as best actor for von sydow he received a second 
standing ovation when he left the stage 
its very strange he admitted afterward i dont know how 
you feel but i feel like im 25 inside i dont feel that i have 
any kind of lifetime achievement 
film critics would argue with that if he had appeared only in 
the bergman films von sydow would have earned a place in movie 
history but he also has contributed a series of noteworthy 
performances in a wide variety of films from the profound jesus 
christ in the greatest story ever told to the eerie the 
exorcist to the frivolous ming the merciless in flash 
gordon 
like most successful actors von sydows career was the result 
of a series of happy accidents he was born 60 years ago in lund 
sweden the son of a university professor and his wife max 
happened to see some plays in nearby malmo prompting him to enroll 
in dramatic classes at high school after his twoyear military 
service he enrolled in the royal academy training ground for such 
famous swedes as greta garbo and ingrid bergman 
von sydow played repertory at the malmo municipal theater where 
bergman had been hired as chief director when bergman filmed the 
seventh seal he chose the young actor as a returning crusader 
the pair collaborated on 11 films 
george stevens was impressed with von sydows strong mystical 
persona and cast him in the mammoth unrealized the greatest 
story ever told hawaii with julie andrews was also a 
disappointment but the two films established von sydow as an 
international star he has been working all over the world ever 
since 
before leaving montreal for a new film in australia von sydow 
paused for an interview with the associated press 
q you have now directed your first film katinka how did 
you like being on the other side of the camera 
a it was a great experience very exciting i had never had 
any plans to become a director but this was something very 
special it dealt with a novel i had found a long time ago i fell 
in love with it immediately and saw it as a film with me playing a 
part in it 
i tried to convince my director friends but nobody caught on 
to it then someone approached me to direct the film and i 
couldnt turn it down i was too old to play one of the parts 
unfortunately time does these things to you it was a great 
experience exhausting but i learned a lot 
q at the tribute you mentioned that the first 20 years as an 
actor were a kind of therapy for you what did you mean 
a i have a feeling that many actors choose acting because 
theres something they long for but cannot reach that theres 
something they cannot express in their private lives that theres 
a threshold they cannot pass 
i was a very shy boy when i was a kid i had difficulty to 
communicate with people i didnt know when i started acting in an 
amateur group in high school although i wasnt aware of it at the 
time i suddenly got a tool in my hand that was wonderful i was 
allowed to express all kinds of strange things that i never dared 
to express before now i could do it with the character as a 
shield as a defense and as an excuse 
i think that for many years i used my profession as some kind 
of a mental therapy i worked all the time and i needed it i was 
restless and i was very crazy if i was not allowed to work 
through the years i have backed off life has helped me and my 
friends and my wife and my family today i dont need that therapy 
anymore 
q the acting life has sent you all over the world did you 
expect that when you started out 
a no that happened later it has its advantages and its 
drawbacks but that can be very exciting im grateful because ive 
seen so much of the world that i wouldnt have seen otherwise but 
sometimes you get a little too much of hotel rooms and suitcases 
and packing and unpacking i think ill try to take it a little 
easier in the future 
im planning to do more theater at least one production a 
year limited engagement 
q where is home nowadays 
a my home is in paris funny thing is that i havent spent 
much time there because ive been working elsewhere we have an 
apartment which i like very much its a wonderful old palace in 
the old quarter of paris its where beaumarchais wrote the 
marriage of figaro it has been remodeled and we have the attic 
of the house 
we also have a summer place in sweden and summer in sweden is 
very important i guess i am more of a country boy than a city boy 
even though i grew up in a small town 
q your world travels have caused separations from your family 
right 
a not always but for long periods my wife comes along when 
i go to places she thinks she will enjoy its not easy but i have 
a good wife and we like each other very much we have managed to 
stay together

joseph e furey worked night and day covering all 
surfaces in his apartment with painted cardboard hearts bow ties 
stars and squares small plaster birds dried lima beans and peas 
clamshells from coney island mussel and oyster shells and pieces 
of tile and glass 
heartbroken over the death of his wife lillian furey spent six 
years creating a memorial for her with mementos he found 
then with nearly 80000 objects on every wall ceiling 
cupboard and mirror he left it all behind he saw his work as an 
obsession fulfilled 
the brooklyn museum sees it now as art unpreserved and is 
taking steps to save fureys creation 
i was absolutely astonished when i first saw it said 
barbara head millstein the museums associate curator of painting 
and sculpture it looked like a jeweled grotto 
the work was discovered last february after vincent kelley a 
realestate developer bought the building in which furey had 
lived after entering fureys apartment he called the museum 
millstein hurried over for the last few months she has been 
trying to persuade the borough of brooklyn to buy the apartment and 
preserve it on site the lath walls and heavy plaster would crumble 
if removed she said 
she said she will document the work with photographs and a 
transcript of a lengthy interview with the 83yearold furey once 
an ironworker on the golden gate and the george washington bridges 
furey who moved out of the apartment nearly a year ago after it 
was broken into twice and now lives with his son joseph jr in 
chester ny is amused by all the attention as for being an 
artist hes had no formal training and the only museum he has 
ever visited is the american museum of natural history 
he spent 14 to 18 hours a day on his project from 1982 to 1988 
cutting out the cardboard figures of hearts diamonds and bow ties 
made in honor of his friend bow tie george and painting each one 
in a planned color scheme but few people then thought his work 
art 
most people looked at it but they didnt see it he said 
millstein said most people including some members of fureys 
family thought he was bananas 
but not now 
his work is called obsessive or personal art millstein said 
adding that such art is rarely preserved 
theres hasnt been enough encouragement to save it because 
you cant take it to christies or sothebys and sell it she 
said of the noted auction houses in new york city it can be as 
a matter of fact quite ugly it has more to do with obsession than 
it does with beauty 
fureys outpouring is in the same vein as simon rodias watts 
towers in los angeles made out of concrete seashells and broken 
glass thomas trapanis complex and decorative furniture which he 
made in his new jersey home after his wife died in 1918 and 
korczak ziolkowskis 35year project of carving a black hills 
mountain in south dakota into a likeness of sioux indian leader 
crazy horse a work his family has continued since his death in 
1982 
its a private thing these people are doing its outside of 
the main art world said jordan davis manager of the 
clevelandbased spaces a gallery that promotes sitespecific art 
most of these people dont consider themselves artists but they 
are very creative people you look at their work and you say 
holy smokes 
millstein said furey is one of a group of artists who spring 
up all over the world compulsively forced at some time in their 
life to finish a project they usually have some kind of trauma in 
their life and they are driven to finish a project a lot of them 
are older people who have a last burst of artistic creativity 
walking into fureys apartment is like stepping into a miniature 
museum that didnt put any of its collection in storage the floor 
is the only bare space 
he started in the bathroom moved to the living room then the 
kitchen then the hallway he said he covered doors both sides 
he pasted cutouts around the edges of mirrors and for ceiling 
work he rigged up a scaffold 
this is not slapdash you know furey said i would wake 
up at two three or four oclock in the morning and start making 
cutouts id paint them different colors and work for eight or 10 
or 12 hours then id take a nap in the recliner chair for a couple 
of hours and start up again 
on the ceilings he made rings around the light fixtures of 
shells bow tieshaped cardboard cutouts and cardboard stars 
in the hallway he nailed cementfilled shells to the walls 
some of the shells came from a neighborhood deli 
a dining room wallpaper of a western scene is partly covered 
with the decoupage furey also pasted cows poodles chipmunks and 
monkeys next to the wallpaper horses 
hearts are everywhere many are bright red many others are 
black 
the whole project was more or less to kill time and to get 
over my grief of losing her furey said of his wife who died in 
1981 i had a lot of time on my hands not much to do and i 
missed her 
millstein said the objects represented different parts of 
fureys life and many were for lillian the small birds for 
instance represented the couples peaceful life together 
the two had married during the depression and moved into the 
apartment in the mid1930s they raised five children there 
we had a good life together furey said 
fureys art reveals that it was millstein said 
its a fiveroom love story she said

the king of the world the master of disaster 
the big man after more than 20 years in rock n roll and almost 
as many nicknames clarence clemons prefers the simple tag mr c 
all those names its a heavy cross to bear said clemons 
the mightiest supporting star of bruce springsteens e street band 
i think about all that stuff but mr c has evolved and hes 
the guy who combines all these things 
size power and allnight parties are part of mr c personality 
counts too as clemons says it takes someone special to play the 
saxophone 
you got to have an urban attitude be a streetwise person 
he said i dont know whether the saxophone made me this kind of 
person or if i was just born to play a saxophone its an extension 
of yourself 
nobody played instruments in my family my father got that bug 
and said he wants his son to play saxophone i wanted an electric 
train for christmas but he got me a saxophone i flipped out 
clemons prides himself on being a survivor staying around even 
when music involved far more than the simple joy of playing the 
sax on tour now with ringo starr and a band that includes joe 
walsh levon helm and rick danko clemons is getting those old 
feelings back 
every night when levon helm breaks into the weight i catch 
myself clemons said of the bands drummer when rick danko 
goes into his bass i have flashbacks to when i was young and wild 
and didnt understand a thing 
you need to go back a little bit and remember how it was and 
how screwed up it got it was a wonderful time this whole tour is 
bringing back this stuff 
clemons also reaches back on his third solo album a night 
with mr c which recalls a few other nicknames such as king 
as in king curtis whose sweet saxophone was featured on hits by 
the coasters sam cooke aretha franklin and many others clemons 
covers cookes party classic twistin the night away 
king curtis is my mentor clemons said i try to pattern 
myself after his style he made a live record thats one of my 
favorites memphis soul stew and soul serenade are two songs 
that made me understand the kind of music i liked 
junior walker motowns hottest sax player of the 60s is 
acknowledged with clemons version of shotgun clemons also 
sings quarter to three a hit for gary us bonds and does 
a duet with pop star kim carnes on his own dance dance dance 
singings one of the hardest things clemons said it was 
terrible the first few times 
i was so depressed i went into the house and didnt come out 
for six months that still looms in the back of my mind i sang in 
the church choir and was a great singer i felt comfortable there 
on stage springsteen loves to remember the time he and e street 
guitarist steve van zandt were on the boardwalk outside a new 
jersey club at four in the morning through wind and pouring rain 
a large man appeared dressed in white carrying a saxophone 
that clemons agrees is how he and the boss first met back 
in the early 70s the short skinny guitarist and his towering 
sideman like springsteen clemons has some stories to tell there 
was the time the e street band appeared on the same bill as rock 
n roll pioneers chuck berry and jerry lee lewis 
it was at the university of maryland and we were chuck berrys 
band clemons recalled ten minutes before the show no chuck 
berry five minutes later he walks in with his guitar complains 
about something and sends it back he comes back and we walk on 
stage 
the bass player garry tallent walks over to him and says 
hey chuck what are we going to play chuck stops and says i 
think were going to play some chuck berry music we played the 
whole set with no rehearsal no nothing he never told you the next 
song 
the rest quickly became history by 1975 critic jon landau had 
dubbed springsteen the future of rock n roll leading to 
simultaneous covers on time and newsweek born to run 
featuring clemons blistering solo was an instant rock anthem 
even gathering support as the official song of springsteens native 
new jersey 
but business soon set in legal hassles delayed springsteens 
darkness on the edge of town album harsh words were exchanged 
all around the simple joy of rosalita and thunder road was 
gone 
that was the beginning of it that was a sign clemons said 
the handwriting was on the wall for a lot of people not just 
springsteen you look at the record companies and see the turnover 
in personnel and wonder what is going on 
so clemons chooses to look the other way concentrating on his 
music and getting by as best he can 
i tell people to get out of the business forget about it if 
youre not really really special forget about it its glamorous 
and beautiful and at the same time it aint you got to have faith 
and you got to have a lot of luck

as a child growing up in massachusetts 
jan cohn was too smart to read the saturday evening post 
now as a 56yearold english professor and dean of faculty at 
trinity college shes not only reading issues of the magazine she 
ignored as a girl shes also written a book about what she learned 
when i was growing up it was always there recalled cohn 
who graduated second in her brookline high school class behind her 
more famous classmate michael dukakis i of course never read 
it because i was a great intellectual snob i would hug my kafka 
for my parents it was part of their life part of their 
expectation 
cohns parents were in good company the publication grew from a 
book with no circulation advertising or major writers to recommend 
it to a national magazine with a circulation of nearly 3 million 
at its peak cohn said 
when she finally got around to reading the magazine it took her 
10 years to get caught up she spent most of that time holed up in 
the library of congress thumbing through 38 years worth of the 
posts weekly issues almost 2000 magazines 
the research led to creating america curtis publishing co 
2495 its a 284page book chronicling the magazine under george 
horace lorimer the editor who from 1899 to 1936 transformed the 
post from a cutandpaste job of sentimental fiction and worse 
poetry to one of americas great mass magazines perhaps its 
greatest according to cohn 
more than creating a great magazine though cohn says lorimer 
sought to shape a great america 
the title of the book represents my idea that lorimer was 
quite consciously trying to create an america she said in a 
recent interview at her office at trinity college he was worried 
about regionalism about how you could bond all of this i think 
what he did in effect was a gradual shaping and consolidating of 
the primary deep movements of the american culture 
one of the first things lorimer did as editor was to announce on 
dec 30 1899 the posts plans for 1900 
in a twopage advertisement lorimer asserted that the post was 
neither a local publication nor a news weekly but a magazine whose 
appeal is national 
the ad proclaimed the post would become the indespensible 
magazine and went on to describe the average american 
he is an omnivorous reader the ad said his range of 
interests is wider than that of the citizen of any other country 
and so it is necessary for a magazine that will meet his needs to 
be of the broadest scope possible 
the ad promised to deliver fiction to satisfy a healthy 
appetite rather than attempt to create an abnormal one as it 
worked to secure the greatest living writers 
lorimer made good on his promise by 1900 the magazine carried 
stories by joel chandler harris hamlin garland bret harte 
rebecca harding davis and paul laurence dunbar 
he genuinely wanted the best in fiction as he judged it and 
he set out to get it by providing much more favorable terms than 
any other magazine offered cohn writes in creating america 
the post guaranteed to read stories within 72 hours of receipt 
and to pay on acceptance rather than on publication 
understandably these policies paid off handsomely 
eventually the post would publish fiction by such writers as f 
scott fitzgerald frank norris and jp marquand and dispatches 
from around the world by irving cobb sam blythe bill irwin and 
mary roberts rinehart who reported from the front during world war 
i 
its covers would feature the work of harrison fisher and norman 
rockwell who once declined an offer by a competing magazine to 
double the price for his work out of loyalty to lorimer and his 
magazine 
not everything about lorimer was golden however 
although he was a patriot lorimer thought getting involved in 
world war i was a disaster and afterwards he became conservative 
and opposed any kind of progressive social movement cohn said 
the magazine suffered becoming less interesting but everyone 
still loved it because it was the post she said 
then in the 1930s lorimer came to life again devoting the last 
four years of his editorship to essentially running against 
franklin d roosevelt when roosevelt won lorimer resigned and 
died a year later 
as much as im personally opposed to the politicis of the 
post in the 1930s its full of energy not just the fiction but 
the nonfiction cohn said 
cohn who teaches a class in popular literature at trinity using 
harlequin romances westerns and comic strips said there are no 
modernday equivalents to the post or its editor 
there was a time when edward r murrow or walter cronkite 
commanded the same authority although the medium makes it 
different she said even though lorimer was a celebrity he 
was invisible you never saw his name except in the last editorial 
he wrote it isnt lorimer you could think of as an edward r 
murrow it was the magazine

roger whittaker is a sales wonder in 25 
years he has recorded 43 albums and sold 30 million lps worldwide 
one single record alone the last farewell in 1978 sold 11 
million copies 
its staggering astonishing said the 53yearold whittaker 
in a telephone interview from germany i face it as it comes 
along its great to know you can do it if you think about it you 
get a swelled head 
his topselling albums in the united states are the best of 
roger whittaker and all my best both nearing sales of 1 
million many of his records are sold through tv marketing 
including best loved ballads and all time hearttouching 
favorites 
he has just released for overthecounter sale another album 
id fall in love tonight produced in nashville it includes 
country music standards like blue eyes crying in the rain 
there goes my everything and have i told you lately that i 
love you 
the singersongwriterguitarist now records for universal 
records after 19 years and 19 albums with rca singing in three 
languages english french and spanish has widened his appeal 
whittaker also has gained a larger audience through hawking his 
albums on tv universal records thinks hes someone who can get 
consumers to buy records at the retail level rather than just 
picking up the phone and dialing the number shown on the tv screen 
were looking forward to adding to our collection of gold and 
platinum albums said jimmy bowen universal president 
whittaker is a star in north america europe australia and 
various points in between one nashville record store recently had 
four different whittaker albums and five different compact discs 
i can go anywhere he said its a wonderful feeling ive 
made 10 tours of canada we did better business on this 10th tour 
than any one weve done 
singing love ballads and not making drastic changes in style 
have helped him do well he said 
ive stayed in the style and never tried to conform to 
convention ive sung the kind of songs i write even when out of 
vogue fifteen percent of the recordbuying public buy my kind of 
music ive stayed faithful to that core of people 
every once in a while a song comes along that every one takes 
to like the last farewell he said 
he described the last farewell as a happy marriage of 
lyrics and melody 
it was number one in places like finland where they dont 
speak english said whittaker they still play it in russia so 
the tune must have a lot to do with its success the 
englishspeaking nations identified with the chorus for you are 
beautiful and i love you dearly 
the lyrics were emotive to me and i identified with them 
in his writing and singing whittaker looks for songs that 
express realism 
if i can relate to what a person is saying then i sing it 
like downtown or the last farewell if it reflects something of 
my own experience then i sing it 
whittaker born in nairobi kenya now lives in london he has a 
degree in biochemistry from the university of bangor in wales 
i did become a biochemist he said but i wanted to go 
into the entertainment business to get it out of my system the 
more i got into it the more i fought to succeed 
the less i succeeded the more i fought he said it 
became a real mania for me my father threatened me about getting 
the right job when i finally found success he came around a bit 
apart from his recording and concert tours his tv special 
roger whittaker in kenya a musical safari was shown by the 
british broadcasting corp and in the united states by the disney 
channel on cable tv 
he is active in efforts to help save africas black rhino 
donating proceeds from program sales at concerts and recording 
royalties to a trust fund to create sanctuaries for the rhino in 
kenya

sales of north americanmade cars and trucks rose 
127 percent in midseptember based on a strong showing by general 
motors corp but at least one analyst wondered how long it could 
go on 
the eight major us automakers said monday they sold cars and 
light trucks at an average daily rate of 37948 during the sept 
1120 period this year compared with a rate of 33670 during the 
same time last year 
gm buyers propelled the companys truck sales up 46 percent and 
car sales by 112 percent combined gms vehicle sales were up 
217 percent during the period this year over last year 
they had incentives that were closing that had been scheduled 
to end this week and a lot of dealer incentives said analyst ron 
glantz of montgomery securities inc in san francisco 
the dealer incentives which manufacturers give to their 
retailers to use as they please have helped move cars and trucks 
said bill meier general manager of ray green chevrolet in 
jacksonville ill 
i think finally they realized that when you put the money in 
the dealers pockets theyre going to sell them he said of the 
cars on his lot meier said an inventory of 35 1989 model vehicles 
on his lot at the beginning of the month had shrunk to eight by 
monday 
they dealers asked us to give them money so they could sell 
in their marketplace said gm spokesman terry sullivan at 
least in the first 20 days of september theyre proving that may 
have made some sense 
were just having a very strong september he said 
but glantz and other analysts have said for weeks that the boom 
that has gone on during the past several sales periods may stem 
from incentives and reports of price increases on 1990 models that 
are pushing consumers into buynow thinking 
the industry has an above average amount of inventory there 
are unprecedented incentives and a whopping price increase for the 
1990s glantz said sales are going to fall off a cliff in 
october 
so far this year car and truck sales by the eight manufacturers 
are down 15 percent compared to the same 1988 period a 04 
percent increase in truck sales was more than offset by a 26 
percent decline in car sales 
gm and chrysler corp already have begun offering incentives on 
their 1990 models sometimes even before the vehicles officially go 
on sale ford motor co is expected to jump into the incentive fray 
dealers have worried that consumers are getting so conditioned 
to incentives that cars and trucks must have them in order to be 
attractive meier was bullish on the future of the industry 
the 1990 price increases are one thing but when people come 
out and see what they are getting and with the incentives there 
isnt that much different he said 
ford said sales of its cars and light trucks were up 34 percent 
in midseptember over last year car sales were up 26 percent and 
truck sales rose 45 percent for the year fords vehicle sales 
were down 07 percent 
car and truck sales at chrysler were up 07 percent in 
midseptember car sales were up 21 percent and truck sales were 
down 07 percent for the year vehicle sales at chrysler were 
running 59 percent behind last years pace 
for the year gm has sold 39 percent fewer vehicles than it did 
through sept 20 1988

congress is taking aim at alleged 
pricegouging among a new crop of telephone companies that serve 
the traveling public 
the house on a voice vote monday passed a bill that would 
regulate prices and require extensive disclosure to callers using 
any of the more than 35 alternativeoperator companies which have 
sprung up in the wake of the 1984 breakup of the bell system 
the bill would require the federal communications commission to 
investigate the industrys charges and determine if such companies 
dominate the market enough to require regulation a companion bill 
is pending in the senate 
the companies would have to file their prices with the fcc 
within 30 days and if the commission finds them unjust or 
unreasonable the companies would have to justify the rates 
which can be far greater than the fees for similar calls from 
customers homes 
rep edward j markey dmass said the legislation was 
designed to protect consumers from pricegouging by fastbuck 
artists without jeopardizing the future of the operator services 
industry 
one caller told the fcc he was charged 2753 for a 27minute 
call from a florida hotel to connecticut using an atampt calling 
card atampt would have normally charged 460 
the measure also would order the fcc to extend to the entire 
operator services industry disclosure requirements imposed on five 
of the companies in february 
there are more than 35 operator services companies in the united 
states providing approximately 5 percent of the 12 billion market 
for dial0 services such as credit card third party billing 
and collect calls 
the fcc does not regulate these companies rates because the 
commission says they dont dominate the market 
but critics say they do dominate in places such as schools 
hotels and airports where they often control all longdistance 
calls

consumer labor and government watchdog groups 
announced today their opposition to president bushs plan to cut 
the capital gains tax saying it would be a windfall for 
highincome taxpayers 
capital gains proponents are asking americans to ignore the 
unjustified financial windfall this tax break will provide to 
individuals who need it the least said fred wertheimer 
president of common cause a selfstyled citizens lobby involved in 
government ethics isssues 
congress is once again hearing the claim that there is nothing 
wrong with the economy that a tax cut for people with incomes over 
200000 wont cure said joan claybrook president of public 
citizen a ralph nader organization 
the vote is a critical test of whether the congress is truly a 
representative body or whether it is a captive of big money 
lobbyists and the wealthy she said that vote could come as 
early as wednesday 
if congress approves of this new tax break members of 
congress may find it hard to explain to working people back home 
why they voted for yet another bargain with highincome 
taxpayers said a statement by the friends committee on national 
legislation a quaker group 
the groups held a news conference in the capitol as the battle 
over the capital gains tax moved to the airwaves with republicans 
and democrats advertising for popular support on an issue that is 
dividing congress sharply along partisan lines 
george bush wants to raid the treasury by reducing capital 
gains taxes for the superrich and he wants working americans to pay 
for it house majority leader richard gephardt dmo argues in 
a television spot produced by the democratic national committee 
why are foreign economies growing faster than the us one 
big reason is taxes says a republican ad that pictures an 
american flag slipping behind flags from japan taiwan and korea 
we have one of the worlds highest capital gains taxes it 
says while the comparable taxes in those other countries are 
miniscule 
the parties were buying time for the ads in washington where 
the target will be the votes of a few mostly conservative democrats 
who could decide the outcome when the house votes it is the 
biggest test for the new house democratic leadership under speaker 
thomas s foley of washington and for a republican strategy that 
seeks to weaken the majority leadership by courting conservative 
democrats 
the republicans say democrats by fighting the bushsupported 
plan to cut the maximum capital gains rate from 33 percent to 196 
percent over the next 27 months are attached to a tax and 
spend philosophy 
the democratic alternative would raise marginal tax rates on the 
wealthy to the same 33 percent paid in the bracket that covers the 
uppermiddleincome that revenue would then be used to restore tax 
breaks for individual retirement accounts 
the democratic plan also includes a capital gains cut to 28 
percent so it would not cut the marginal rate paid by the most 
wealthy 
its clearly a reconfirmation that they want to raise taxes 
bushs budget director richard darman said monday whos going to 
believe they want to stop there 
foley denounced darmans comments as stuff and nonsense 
the democrats oppose the bushbacked plan because it is ill 
timed ill considered and damaging helping only the richest of 
our citizens and unfair to the middle class he said 
the capital gains tax cut is part of a huge budget bill before 
the house the package would be contentious even without the tax 
fight because it also contains changes in the medicare 
catastrophic health coverage plan new federal child care programs 
and dozens of other issues with divided support 
nearly buried beneath the controversial issues is the bills 
underlying purpose which is reducing the federal deficit 
rep bill frenzel dminn said a review of the bill showed 
that much of the deficitreduction in the package was 
disingenuous and after three years the bill would be adding to 
the red ink 
still frenzel said he would probably vote for the bill if it 
includes the gopsupported capital gains tax cut he didnt put 
that in the disingenuous category but included figures showing 
that it too would begin adding billions of dollars to the deficit 
after an initial period of added revenues

a subsidiary of whittaker corp and two 
former executives pleaded guilty today to charges they bribed a 
marine corps contracting official to increase the value of pentagon 
electronic contracts their company obtained 
whittaker command and control systems pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy to defraud the government and two counts of bribing 
former marine corps official jack sherman with nearly 75000 
between 1982 and 1988 
the whittaker subsidiary agreed to pay 35 million in fines 
civil penalties and reimbursement for the cost of the investigation 
scott m lamberth 59 the former head of the subsidiary and 
john f van tassel exdirector of operations at its fayetteville 
ark facility also entered guilty pleas before us district 
judge claude m hilton 
the plea by the whittaker subsidiary is the third by a 
corporation since the investigation began last year teledyne 
electronics and hazeltine corp have both entered guilty pleas for 
their roles in the procurement scandal 
according to court papers officials of whittaker corp of los 
angeles were unaware of the bribery scheme which began before the 
company acquired the subsidiary in 1986 
the bribery scheme allegedly began in 1982 when the company was 
known as lee telecommunications and continued two years after its 
acquisition by whittaker 
lamberth was a stockholder of the company and became head of the 
subsidiary following its acquisition by whittaker court papers 
said lamberth hid the scheme from whittaker officials 
the bribes allegedly were funneled to sherman through defense 
consultants john marlowe thomas muldoon and donald illeman 
marlowe is cooperating with the fbis continuing investigation 
of pentagon procurement fraud dubbed operation ill wind 
muldoon and illeman have not been charged 
sherman who pleaded guilty to taking bribes from marlowe as 
part of an fbi undercover sting signed authorizations that greatly 
enhanced the value of two contracts the company obtained to help 
the marines develop a battlefield air traffic control system court 
papers said 
sherman signed papers increasing the value of one contract from 
600000 to 25 million according to the papers and also 
authorized the enhancement of another contracts value from 
540000 to 36 million 
he also authorized the transfer to lee telecommunications of 
another contract worth 16 million when the company that first 
obtained the deal had difficulty developing software the court 
papers said 
lamberth faced a possible 20year sentence and fines up to 
500000 for his guilty pleas to conspiracy and bribery 
van tassel could be sentenced to up to 15 years and fined 
250000 for his bribery plea 
hilton scheduled a dec 15 sentencing proceeding for both

japanese and west german central banks today 
intervened in currency markets for the second consecutive day 
driving down the value of the dollar in an effort to reduce the 
us trade deficit 
the intervention followed broader action on monday when the 
united states great britain canada and france joined the bank of 
japan and west german bundesbank in concerted dollar selling 
the actions are in line with a weekend statement by the group of 
seven industrial countries the united states japan west 
germany great britain france italy and canada expressing 
displeasure with the dollars strength and fear that its rise in 
recent months could blunt improvement in the us trade deficit 
a strong dollar hurts the trade gap by making us goods more 
expensive on foreign markets while lowering the price of imports 
to american consumers 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day 
begins the dollar today fell 015 yen to a closing 14280 japanese 
yen it was quoted at the same level later in london the us 
currency was worth 19035 west german marks in early trading on 
friday before the g7 meeting the dollar bought 146 yen and 195 
marks 
meanwhile the worlds financial officials began meetings today 
of the 152nation international monetary fund and its sister 
lending organization the world bank 
delegates to the meeting are discussing a range of topics from 
the deterioration of the environment in developing countries the 
third worlds crushing 13 trillion debt burden and the movement 
of poland and hungry from communism to freemarket economies 
michel camdessus managing director of the imf pushed today for 
a doubling of the funds resources from the current 120 billion 
but ran into resistance from great britain saudi arabia and the 
united states which has veto power over the matter 
the fund has to be of credible size so that it gives 
confidence to the membership and to financial markets that it could 
respond adequately to any unexpected shock such as those of the 
mid 1970s and early 1980s he said 
on third world debt camdessus called on private banks to step 
up their lending to developing countries even as they are forced 
to write off old debt as part of treasury secretary nicholas f 
bradys debt strategy 
it is now vital to establish the necessary conditions to bring 
about a more appropriate contribution from the private sector he 
said 
world bank president barber b conable said economic development 
must be coupled with new efforts to preserve the environment in 
third world countries 
it will be impossible to improve the quality of life 
unless we do much more to conserve our global environment he 
said singling out a reduction in carbon monoxide emissions which 
contribute to global warming as a goal 
he also said the third world which spends 200 billion a year 
on defense more than its combined expenditure on health and 
education must devote fewer resources to the military if it 
expects to prosper 
developing countries on one side and their arms suppliers and 
creditors on the other must adapt to a world where budgets are 
tight he said in evaluating their military expenditures 
governments should be realistic but they also should remember the 
human consequences of these choices 
on monday officials attending the meetings expressed 
satisfaction with the results of the intervention 
french finance minister pierre beregovoy told reporters it 
reflected the reassertion of our common will to cooperate in 
monetary terms bundesbank president karl otto poehl said a 
decline in the dollar was appropriate and reasonable and 
pronounced the action by central banks obviously quite 
successful 
on other fronts monday 
brady pushed for expansion of his third world debt strategy 
announced in march which has so far produced tentative agreements 
between creditor banks and mexico and the philippines 
important progress is being made within the strengthened debt 
strategy we must now push ahead to ensure that the benefits of the 
strategy reach a broad range of countries brady told the 
development committee of the world bank which met monday in 
preparation for todays meeting of the boards of governors of the 
two world lending organizations 
william ryrie executive vice president of the international 
finance corporation an arm of the world bank offered polish 
finance minister leszek balcerowicz help in setting up a new 
financial system 
ryrie said the efforts are centering on creating a new banking 
system he said two or three western european banks which he 
declined to name have already expressed an interest

the roar of blast furnaces the grinding 
of ore in the crusher room and the rattle of conveyors that have 
sustained this town for 90 years have come to a halt since the 
mexican army closed the cananea copper mine 
only the sound of birds in the walnut and cottonwood trees of 
cananeas central plaza basketballs bouncing on outdoor courts 
dogs barking and popular music drifting on the breeze remain 
what an ugly silence said herminia de tona as she and her 
retired miner husband watched the sunset from the front porch of 
their home overlooking the open pit of mexicos largest copper 
mine the government left us in the street 
the cananea mine has been an icon of the mexican labor movement 
since 1906 when strikers who survived bloody military repression 
went on to become leaders of the mexican revolution mindful of 
that symbolic background the government sent the army in on aug 
20 when it announced the bankruptcy of the 90 percent stateowned 
compania minera de cananea 
the mine closure threw some 3000 union mineworkers out of jobs 
causing worry in the town of 35000 whose economy revolves around 
the mine we dont know whats going on were all uncertain 
said maria elena lopez who has two nephews who worked in the mine 
picking pink roses outside her red brick home she added 
everybody here is affected 
sales in local stores have dropped by 90 percent because so many 
of the towns breadwinners were put out of work according to the 
local chamber of commerce 
we were selling 2 million pesos about 800 worth a day 
said pharmacy owner dina carillo we are down to 600000 now we 
have to give credit to people and we dont know if theyre going to 
be able to pay 
the cananea mine had been operating in the black producing 3 
percent of the worlds copper and 45 percent of mexicos output at 
a cost of 90 cents a pound in times when buyers are paying more 
than 1 a pound for the metal but the government has been trying 
to sell the operation to private investors as part of a national 
privatization effort 
state ownership of companies has decreased from 1222 to 744 
since 1982 
two deals to sell the mine fell through last year and the 
government is looking for a third chance 
local section 65 spokesman arturo borjorquez of the industrial 
union of miners metallurgical workers and allied trades of the 
mexican republic says the bankruptcy announcement one week before 
mineworkers were set to go on strike for collective bargaining 
contract demands was a means to break the union and make the 
operation more attractive to private investors 
i think the government wants to dress up the bride so she can 
get married he said 
the mineworkers earned 3000 to 4000 per year plus benefits 
the government says their demands amounted to a 330 percent 
increase in salary and benefits 
nacional financiera the government bank and majority 
shareholder in the mine called the move a painful measure but 
the only viable option 
president carlos salinas de gortari told labor leaders and 
lawmakers in mexico city that all companies privatized under this 
strategy should be seen as opportunities for worker ownership 
labor secretary arsenio farrell subsequently offered miners 25 
percent control of the operation 
union rankandfiler members have talked about assuming 
ownership responsibilities in the past but have never made a 
formal proposal borjorquez says 
miners organizing for better pay and conditions in 1906 were 
brutally put down by mexican troops and us reinforcements in one 
of the first trade union movements in mexico more than 20 miners 
died in the fight and dozens more were imprisoned today the 
martyrs of 1906 are immortalized in a folk song whose lyrics 
are emblazoned on a signboard inside the cananea jail where some of 
the strikers were detained 
this time when the army came in there was not a single case 
of mistreatment said mario elizarde now in charge of guarding 
the idled mine facilities 
army helicopters dropped leaflets over the town announcing the 
bankruptcy as 3000 soldiers were martialed into the mine the 
government just wanted to be secure said elizarde 
when the troops arrived cananea security chief nick shaw and 
mayor francisco javier taddei agreed to order the towns 12 
cantinas and all other liquor outlets closed it was a preventive 
measure shaw said 
the weekly dances in the town square were called off too a 
measure that upset local youth its making life hard on us 
kids said ana veronica rojas who was joined by other 
highschoolers in her complaints 
the army pulled out after six days and the union staged a 
symbolic mine takeover on aug 28 the day miners had set to strike 
for contract renegotiation demands before the bankruptcy 
declaration 
the companys bankruptcy administrator financiero nacional 
azucarera has said the miners will get severance pay set by 
federal labor law although their contract calls for six times as 
much 
the miners have refused to accept severance pay and appealed the 
bankruptcy decision demanding that the mine be reopened their 
contract observed and that contract negotiations be taken up 
unions organizations and individuals in the united states have 
sent food and clothing to cananea to help the mineworkers and their 
families the government and the institutional revolutionary party 
have also sent provisions 
union leaders and labor department officials are negotiating in 
mexico city as bankruptcy administrators settle the details of 
accounts due and the government debates the future of the sleeping 
copper giant

the face of general motors corps minivans has 
undergone plastic surgery and chrysler corp may not like gms nose 
job 
ever since small passenger vans caught the fancy of american 
buyers chrysler has commanded a dominant share of the market gm 
is hoping its longhooded minivans will compel chrysler owners to 
switch makes 
while the auto market as a whole likely will shrink during the 
next year there are predictions of continued growth in minivans a 
segment which has seen rapid expansion since 1983 when chrysler 
introduced the dodge caravan and the plymouth voyager 
the minivan market actually is older than that volkswagen 
imported a compact van starting in 1950 and ford motor co in the 
early 1960s sold a falcon club wagon a halffoot shorter than its 
current aerostar minivan 
since the minivans popularity was ignited seven years ago 
chrysler has commanded more than 50 percent of the segment of the 
lighttruck market which includes minivans 
chryslers share is beginning to slip as the ford aerostar and 
the mazda mpv grow in popularity the unknown in the minivan 
formula is how much of the market gm will get chrysler executives 
have conceded they will lose some of their share perhaps a 
percentage point or two 
but we expected that said robert lutz president of 
chrysler motors corp the companys vehiclemaking arm while 
chrysler has slapped big incentives on many of its vehicles the 
voyager and caravan have been exempt 
the patients in gms plastic surgery are the chevrolet lumina 
apv pontiac trans sport and oldsmobile silhouette rakishly styled 
minivans made at gms north tarrytown ny assembly plant over 
the past few months the company has given plant employees loaner 
vans to drive around the new york countryside to let folks get an 
eyeful of the futuristiclooking vehicles 
the gm minivan was originally for the corporations pontiac and 
chevrolet divisions and oldsmobile was added later said a source 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
capacity of the north tarrytown plant is about 200000 minivans 
a year and the mix among the three divisions can be changed 
relatively easily like other minivan makers gm officials expect 
buyers to come from those looking at sedans and station wagons and 
to a smaller extent minivan owners ready to trade in their 
vehicles 
gm is banking on some of those current minivan buyers being 
intrigued by the shape of the gm versions the plasticbodied 
vehicles sport a snout that would have made cyrano de bergerac 
jealous 
analyst charles brady of oppenheimer amp co of new york said he 
thinks the new gm minivans are quite attractive 
the frontwheeldrive vehicles join the conventionally styled 
chevrolet astro which is being offered in fourwheel drive for 
1990 in the assault on chryslers hold on the minivan market all 
chryslers minivans are frontwheel drive 
its the biggest threat that chrysler minivans have received 
to date brady said there really hasnt been anything that 
would serve as a direct substitute the others have either been 
smaller or rearwheel drive 
the minivan battle isnt just between gm and chrysler 
ford continues to offer its aerostar and japanese companies are 
hoping to grab larger pieces of the minivan pie 
chrysler isnt sitting still either it is offering a town amp 
country version of the minivan more expensive than the caravan or 
voyager but loaded with extras including leather seats and a 
compass 
well sell out two minivan plants lutz said speaking of 
the st louis mo and windsor ontario factories 
lutz estimated the introduction of the gm minivans will add 
about 200000 of the vehicles to the road next year cutting 
slightly into chryslers share 
those new purchasers he added will come primarily from 
potential stationwagon buyers chrysler is offering no station 
wagons for 1990 
sales of minivans last year amounted to 725081 units a 211 
percent increase over the year before the vehicles share of the 
lighttruck market has climbed to 138 percent last year from 74 
percent in 1985

bat industries plc which is fending off a hostile 
22 billion bid from hoylake investments ltd on tuesday announced 
a major restructuring that includes the sale of its us retail 
operations 
bat said it would reshape itself to concentrate on tobacco and 
fastgrowing financial services 
sir james goldsmith the anglofrench financier heading 
hoylakes bid said he welcomed bats plan as a first step to 
the unbundling plan he has proposed 
he said he would pursue his takeover attempt and said the 
bidding group for bat would vote in favor of the restructuring 
the british conglomerate said it would sell its retailing 
interests in the united states which include saks fifth avenue and 
marshall fields stores as well as other smaller businesses 
it said it would create two new publicly held companies by 
giving its existing shareholders shares in its british retailing 
company argos as well as shares in a combination of its paper 
companies wiggins teape and appleton 
bat also plans to buy back 10 percent of its shares and to 
significantly increase its dividend for 1989 
these measures require shareholder approval and bat has called 
a special shareholders meeting for oct 19 
the hoylake bidding group has offered 1414 worth of securities 
for each bat share hoylake has suspended the offer while us 
state insurance commissions review its proposed change of ownership 
of bats farmers insurance group inc 
hoylake has vowed to unbundle bat by selling off all its 
nontobacco interests 
hoylake and other critics of bat have complained that bats 
share price doesnt reflect the true value of its underlying 
businesses and is constrained by the relatively slow growth of its 
tobacco businesses 
now bat is seeking to fight off the hoylake bid by addressing 
this problem 
the hoylake offer however has attracted little interest from 
bats shareholders and analysts have said that the bidders will 
have to increase their offer and include some cash in order to 
succeed 
we can now accelerate the strategy of concentrating on 
financial services and tobacco bat chairman patrick sheehy said 
in a statement 
the board now believes that the five decisive steps will 
continue the longterm development of the group and address our 
concern about the value of bat shares on the stock market compared 
to the underlying value of the businesses 
bat said it envisions that tobacco will provide steady earnings 
growth and strong cash flow which will complement the more rapid 
growth expected in financial services during the 1990s these two 
businesses will represent an exceptionally powerful combination 
to enhance shareholder value in the years ahead it said 
bat said tobacco and financial services now contribute about 
15 billion and 1336 billion respectively to its earnings 
bat forecast pretax profit of 32 billion this year a 22 
percent increase over 1988 earnings per share also were forecast 
to rise by 22 percent to 123

opec ministers scrambled on tuesday to patch 
together an agreement on their production plans for the rest of the 
year 
the ministers of the 13nation organization of petroleum 
exporting countries gathered in late morning but postponed an early 
evening meeting to give them more time to come up with a new accord 
opec secretarygeneral subroto announced the delay saying new 
thinking was being developed shortly before then an iranian 
delegate said his country had offered a new plan for raising the 
production ceiling in the final quarter of the year 
the ministers were arguing over whether they can boost 
production from their current limit of 195 million barrels a day 
in the final quarter without upsetting prices 
it seems there will be a little increase said a senior 
member of one delegation who demanded anonymity 
but we still have different positions he said its a 
slow process 
we have to argue a little said kuwaits ali khalifa 
alsabah after the twohour meeting otherwise it wouldnt be 
opec 
the ministers seemed determined to try to rescue the talks 
which were on the verge of collapse monday evening 
we have come back from the edge of the precipice said a 
senior delegate midway through the twohour long morning meeting 
he also demanded anonymity 
the ministers were reported close to a deal monday on raising 
the production ceiling but then hit some snags forcing them to 
postpone formal discussions 
their negotiations most taking place in their rooms at a 
luxury geneva hotel have centered on a lifting the ceiling 
between 20 million barrels a day and 21 million barrels according 
to delegates 
they also must decide how to distribute any increase among the 
13 member nations kuwait and the united arab emirates want bigger 
shares than now allotted them others argue the extra amount should 
be shared proportionately 
late monday evening subroto said we think that tuesday 
could be our last look at the routes to take 
subroto has predicted demand for the cartels oil would reach 22 
million barrels a day in the octoberdecember period 
the cartels executive body according to sources has said 
prices could reach 18 even if the cap were lifted to as much as 
215 million barrels a day but only if all adhered to their 
quotas 
the talks which began saturday are officially held by a 
monitoring panel made up of algeria indonesia iran iraq kuwait 
nigeria saudi arabia and venezuela 
the other members gabon ecuador libya qatar and the united 
arab emirates were invited to attend

the cosmetics industry must have the option of 
testing its products on animals while trying to develop alternative 
methods to ensure those products are safe for consumers an 
industry spokesman said tuesday 
edward kavanaugh president of the cosmetic toiletry and 
fragrance association said the industry regards the safety of 
its consumers as their primary responsibility and highest 
priority 
responding to efforts to ban the use of animals in such product 
testing kavanaugh said the industry is trying to develop 
alternatives 
however makers of personal care products must continue to 
have the option of using animal research data he said 
animal rights activists who gathered outside the industry news 
conference argued that alternatives already have been found and are 
being used 
major corporations have switched to in vitro or nonanimal 
methods including cellculture techniques testing on membranes 
computer modeling susan rich of people for the ethical treatment 
of animals told reporters 
the nations largest cosmetics company avon has invested 
millions of dollars to develop such nonanimal testing 
alternatives company spokesman john cox said in a telephone 
interview 
however cox said avons backs the industry association position 
on testing because there is no one test or even a series of tests 
that could be developed for everybodys products 
until everybody has developed alternatives we feel they ought 
to have the option of testing he said 
eight states california pennsylvania illinois new jersey 
maryland massachusetts connecticut and hawaii are considering 
legislation to ban animal testing for cosmetics household and 
pharmaceutical products

with much of the communist world planning 
economic retooling lessons in capitalism await at the first 
business administration schools designed to turn a new breed of 
east bloc managers into competitive marketoriented executives 
a fundamentally different business environment is developing as 
economically weak poland and increasingly troubled hungary cut 
restraints on domestic entrepreneurs demand that staterun 
enterprises be profitable and open their borders to foreign 
investors 
a handful of executive training programs are being organized to 
meld western management techniques with the realities of eastern 
european business 
intellectually these are not new concepts says andrzej 
kosminski a warsaw university professor creating the international 
business school to open oct 23 near the capital 
but lets say that in our system of management there was no 
use up to now for that kind of approach because of a system 
that was obviously in basic contradiction to sound business 
practices 
kosminskis school will offer the first east bloc equivalent of 
a masters of business administration in addition western 
companies are opening business skills schools in poland and hungary 
during more than four decades of centralized planning for 
captive consumers in communistruled nations business decisions 
were made by remote bureaucratic ministries there was litle need 
to worry about developing hotselling products finding market 
niches advertising and packaging 
motivating workers pleasing customers direct foreign trade and 
cost saving largely are new concepts for the wouldbe east bloc 
entrepreneur 
our business people are used to thinking in socialist 
conditions i produce because i must cover the social need this 
is nonsense said bogda zukowska a journalist for polands 
economic life newspaper 
now they are starting to think i must produce because i 
would like to sell and earn money and i must do my best to cope 
with the market what the market needs and the cost of 
production she said 
hopes for resurrecting polands economy hinge largely on foreign 
investment and domestic private enterprise but poles must learn 
how the west does business when there is competition for customers 
who have a range of choices and foreign investors must learn how 
business works in what kosminski calls polands negotiable 
economy 
at the international business school 48 polish business people 
some private entrepreneurs and others sent by their stateowned 
enterprises have signed up for the first semester at a cost of 
about 250 
the school also will offer orientation programs for western 
managers interested in doing business in the east bloc and offer 
consulting services from students who are doing case studies 
in budapest the hungarian management institute was established 
in november 1988 through a joint venture with italian 
organizations a 10month junior executive program is offered 
along with lecture series for managers 
a canadianpolish partnership is starting the international 
school of management this fall offering programs for executives 
and courses on english for business and how to start your own 
business 
polish regulations on starting private businesses were loosened 
this year under a privatization of enterprises considered crucial 
for turning the economy toward capitalism filling empty stores and 
reviving commercial links with the west 
before these new businesses and those being salvaged from the 
socialist sector can enter the competitive market abroad or 
prosper at home the entrepreneurs will need new techniques 
kosminski said 
the classes at his school are designed to train the elite of 
polish managers as efficient market oriented and globally 
oriented socially responsible competent and reliable business 
partners according to a prospectus 
polish professors and visiting lecturers will offer courses in 
polish and english materials on such subjects as international 
marketing and finance are virtually unavailable in polish to be 
held one week a month through four semesters over two years so 
participants can continue to work 
students will learn accounting business law and quality 
control as well as business protocol how to organize receptions 
and what to say in press releases 
they will combine a knowledge of international business and 
international standards of doing business with local specificity 
kosminski said 
polish managers also will be needed to help western executives 
investing in the country maneuver through logistical and 
bureaucratic obstacles 
our business environment is still exotic kosminski said 
with multiple currency markets supplies from typing paper to 
office chairs virtually unavailable and an endless string of 
arrangements needed to handle the negotiable bureaucracy 
it is difficult for foreign businesses he said thats 
why they need intermediaries people who know both cultures and i 
think some of our graduates might be able to play that role

wheat futures prices moved higher while soybeans 
prices tumbled and corn futures were mostly lower at the close 
tuesday on the chicago board of trade 
a forecast of ideal harvest weather was depressing corn and 
soybeans at the start of the day analysts said then professional 
fund buying pushed prices higher but the rally didnt hold and 
prices declined toward the end of the session 
jon horton an analyst for research department inc said a lack 
of any real export demand for soybeans was weighing on futures 
prices 
wheat prices however were supported by mondays announcement 
from the us agriculture department of a sale to china of 300000 
metric tons of the commodity and anticipation of more export 
business this week traders said 
activity in the corn pit was light as traders await a usda grain 
report later this week said susan leighty of prudentialbache 
securities inc 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 3 cents higher with 
december at 393 a bushel corn was 1 cent lower to 1 cent 
higher with december at 229 a bushel oats were 1 cent to 1 
cents higher with december at 143 a bushel and soybeans were 1

international business machines corp tuesday 
revealed ambitious plans for micro channel architecture its 
patentcovered design for the way information moves around inside 
its personal computers 
ibm also said that micro channel is theoretically capable of 
transferring data at 160 million bytes per second eight times as 
fast as its current speed limit a byte represents one letter or 
number 
the announcements were intended in part to counter the momentum 
of a standard that is being pushed by the gang of nine rival 
makers of personal computers such as compaq computer corp 
advanced logic research inc recently said it will begin 
shipping the first computer built to that rival standard in october 
ibm said it intends to use micro channel not only with personal 
computers but eventually with highspeed workstations and even 
mainframe computers a landmark in the growing importance of 
personal computers 
although ibms mainframe line uses a different system for 
internal data transfer the company said micro channel would 
eventually become the way that mainframes communicate with personal 
computers and workstations 
as a sign of the micro channels importance ibm said the design 
would form the heart of a new line of workstations that will 
replace the relatively unsuccessful rt pc late this year or early 
in 1990 
ibm has tried to make micro channel into an industry standard 
but companies that have come out with compatible machines under 
license to ibm have had limited success ibm is hoping that 
tuesdays announcements will convince customers that micro channel 
announced in 1987 is the wave of the future 
theyre trying to show a sense of order in a potentially 
chaotic environment said sam albert a former ibm executive who 
is now a consultant in scarsdale ny 
ibms rivals say their personal computer standard is better 
because there are more addon devices that will work with it but 
ibm said there are more than 1000 addon devices made by other 
companies to enhance the ibm personal system2 and more in the 
works 
in addition intel corp and chips and technologies inc both 
said tuesday they were working with ibm on developing sets of chips 
that other companies could use to make compatible addon devices 
for the micro channel 
ibm reaffirmed that it would come out with a personal computer 
built on intel corps latest microprocessor the highspeed i486 
by the end of the year it cut prices and introduced new variations 
on several existing models in its personal system2 line

bat industries plc on tuesday proposed the sale of 
its us retailing businesses as part of a restructuring the 
conglomerate hoped would defeat hoylake investments ltds 22 
billion hostile takeover bid 
the planned restructuring was intended to enhance the value of 
bats stock company chairman patrick sheehy said in a statement 
sir james goldsmith the anglofrench financier who leads 
hoylake said he welcomed bats proposal as a first step toward his 
plans for breaking up the conglomerate goldsmith said he would not 
give up his takeover attempt which has been suspended while the 
group tries to overcome regulatory obstacles 
securities analysts said bats proposals would enhance the value 
of the british conglomerates stock and was likely to be approved 
by its shareholders but they said hoylake could still bid for what 
is left of bat 
hoylake has offered 134 billion pounds or 22 billion in 
securities for bat 
bat said it would reshape itself to concentrate on its tobacco 
business which is steady and generates cash and its fastgrowing 
financial services segment this would be a significant departure 
from its previous strategy of gradually diversifying away from 
tobacco 
the retained businesses are expected to account for 80 percent 
of bats forecast 1989 pretax profit of 32 billion bat said 
the british conglomerate said it would sell its us retailing 
business which includes 46 saks fifth avenue stores and 24 
marshall fields stores the two retailers have combined annual 
sales of 2 billion 
these and other planned smaller divestitures could fetch a 
total of 24 billion analysts said 
bat said it also would create two new publicly held companies by 
giving its existing shareholders a stake in its british retailing 
company argos as well as stock in a combination of its paper 
companies wiggins teape and appleton appleton is based in 
wisconsin 
bat said it also would buy back 10 percent of its shares which 
would cost 124 billion pounds or 2 billion at tuesdays closing 
price on londons stock exchange 
the company also pledged to significantly increase its 
dividends the total dividend for 1989 could go as high as 30 
pence or 48 cents per share a 49 percent increase over the 
previous years payment bat said 
bat called a special shareholders meeting for oct 19 to vote on 
the proposed restructuring 
bat stock rose 2 pence or 3 cents a share to close at 818 
pence or 1317 
hoylake has suspended its 1414 a share offer while state 
insurance commissioners in the united states review its proposed 
change of ownership of bats farmers insurance group inc 
hoylake has vowed to break up bat by selling off all its 
nontobacco interests the group and other critics of bat have 
complained the conglomerates stock price does not reflect the true 
value of its underlying businesses because it is constrained by the 
relatively slow growth of its tobacco business 
sheehy in an interview on british radio said the plan would 
give existing shareholders the benefit of splitting up bat rather 
than allowing hoylake to take a profit from dismantling the 
conglomerate 
goldsmith said hoylake would vote in favor of bats plan 
although the investor group was not abandoning its bid 
the point is that theyve made a first step in the direction 
of realizing a higher share value for bat shareholders which is 
the basis of the hoylake argument goldsmith said in a telephone 
interview 
the hoylake offer has attracted little interest from bats 
shareholders and analysts have said that the bidding group would 
have to increase its bid and include some cash to succeed 
andrew mitchell an analyst with the london investment firm 
smith new court plc said it does seem likely that they 
shareholders would approve these bat proposals because it gives 
them a bird in the hand 
it could take hoylake nine months to get regulatory clearance in 
the united states he said 
its a useful start said nigel utley an analyst with laing 
and cruickshank it will enhance shareholder value but not 
necessarily enough to defeat a serious bid

a wall street executive who pleaded guilty to 
three counts of mail fraud for for allegedly bribing a former 
governor of guam has been sentenced to 18 months in prison 
us district judge jesse w curtis on monday also placed arthur 
abba goldberg on five years probation fined him 100000 and 
ordered him to repay the united states 300000 
goldberg executive vice president of the new york bond 
underwriting firm of matthews amp wright pleaded guilty july 14 to 
three counts of mail fraud 
he had been accused of funneling 70000 to former guam gov 
ricardo j bordallos unsuccessful 1986 reelection campaign in 
exchange bordallo allegedly agreed to generate support for a 300 
million housing bond issue underwritten by matthews amp wright 
bordallo was acquitted in february 1986 of accepting bribes from 
goldberg but was convicted on 10 counts of government corruption 
he served as governor from 197579 and from 198387 
goldberg had faced a maximum 15 years imprisonment and a 
750000 fine in addition to restitution payments according to 
william oconnor the us attorney from guam 
the three counts referred to money bilked from the guam program 
development fund and a lulling letter assuring fund authorities 
that the transactions were legal 
a december 1987 indictment charged goldberg with preparing phony 
invoices that were sent to the bank entrusted with the fund money 
the bank paid the money to goldberg who spent 25000 to buy 
campaign paraphernalia including parasols shirts and hats for 
bordallos unsuccessful reelection bid oconnor has said

wrongdoing 
in exchange for goldbergs guilty pleas 46 other counts

iras curtailed three years ago on grounds 
they were an ineffective incentive for saving are being touted 
anew by democrats as a way to spur the economy without further 
enriching the wealthy 
the liberalized individual retirement account is being offered 
as a substitute for the capitalgains tax reduction recommended by 
president bush 
most of the tax benefit from either partys proposal would go to 
the rich and nearrich affecting the wallets of the richest 
onetenth of us taxpayers 
the house is expected to do battle on the issue this week with 
the senate taking it up next month the options will be presented 
as part of a massive bill whose main purpose is to reduce the 
budget deficit 
the choices could not be more stark or compelling house 
majority leader richard a gephardt dmo says about the plan 
offered by the democrats 
white house budget director richard g darman is equally as sure 
about the administration proposal 
the choice is clear he said 
on tuesday president bush vowed to continue his fight for a 
lower capital gains tax even if it prolongs a spending impasse with 
congress and triggers acrosstheboard program cuts he also 
criticized the democratic alternative as unacceptable 
a president has to use the tools at his disposal to accomplish 
the ends for which he was elected and i plan to do exactly that 
bush said speaking to a group of business people in the oval 
office 
the administration wants to cut the maximum tax rate on capital 
gains profits from the sale of stocks and other investments to 
196 percent until 1992 the top rate would then be raised to 28 
percent permanently and gains caused solely by inflation would be 
exempted from taxation the top rate now is 33 percent 
the democrats propose allowing all workers not permitted a full 
ira deduction to write off half a contribution up to 2000 a year 
the money would not be taxed until withdrawn for retirement as the 
down payment on a first home or for college 
although the administration generally favors expanded iras 
house democrats added an angle that makes the proposal unacceptable 
to the white house financing iras by raising taxes on the richest 
600000 couples and individuals 
cutting capital gains or liberalizaing iras would represent a 
major backing away from the 1986 landmark tax overhaul that 
curtailed ira deductions and eliminated the special rate for 
capital gains 
the staff of the joint committee on taxation estimates that 853 
percent of the benefit from the the capitalgains reduction as 
approved by the house ways and means committee would go to those 
with incomes over 75000 a year those people file less than 10 
percent of all tax returns 
just over 49 percent of the new ira benefit would be collected 
by those earning more than 75000 although the withdrawal 
features would help lowerand middleincome taxpayers 
backers of the capitalgains cut contend it will pay for itself 
by spurring economic activity democrats say it will worsen the 
deficit after a threeyear burst of higher revenues 
there is no agreement among economists that either plan would 
have a lasting effect on the economy 
both plans are being promoted as ways to increase the nations 
lagging rate of saving making more money available for business 
expansion and job creation so less will have to be borrowed from 
foreigners 
although the capitalgains issue was debated at length in the 
1988 presidential campaign and has been the subject of 
congressional hearings the notion of expanding iras has drawn 
little attention since they were curtailed to the chagrin of 
middleincome workers in 1986 
in writing its landmark tax overhaul congress concluded that 
the ultimate goal was the lowest possible individual tax rates 
that meant elimination or reduction of various exclusions and 
deductions and two of the most important were the capitalgains 
break and the ira deduction 
rolling back the ira deduction was made easier when congress 
concluded that the deduction apparently had produced little new 
saving that it had simply encouraged taxpayers to transfer money 
from a nontaxable account into a taxdeferred ira 
i had testified for iras and it was a big disappointment when 
evidence indicated they did little to encourage new saving said 
washington economist michael evans 
however the institute for research on the economics of 
taxation headed by former reagan administration official norman 
ture now says the early evidence was wrong 
the weight of the evidence is that iras have had a substantial 
positive net effect on personal saving the institute said in a 
report commissioned by merrill lynch consumer markets 
at the height of ira popularity in 1986 deductions for 378 
billion in contributions were claimed by 155 million taxpayers a 
year later with the deduction curtailed contributions of 141 
billion were deducted on 73 million returns 
before 1986 any worker could contribute up to 2000 a year to 
a taxdeferred ira the overhaul law restricted deductible iras to 
workers not covered by a company pension and to covered single 
workers with incomes 25000 or less and couples earning 40000 or 
less 
single taxpayers with incomes up to 35000 and couples up to 
50000 are allowed a partial deduction

central banks sold waves of dollars again 
tuesday but got less satisfying results as the dollar declined only 
slightly overall and actually rose against japans yen 
the group of seven industrial democracies ganged up against the 
dollar after agreeing last weekend that the dollars rise in recent 
months was inconsistent with longer run economic fundamentals 
tuesdays intervention knocked only a fraction of a percent off 
the dollars value in contrast to mondays decline of nearly 6 
west german pfennigs and 4 japanese yen 
some traders said the attractiveness of us interest rates 
might bring investors back to dollardenominated securities once 
the central bankers let up 
in fact the dollar ended the day above its lows of the session 
maybe the dollar has taken it just a little bit on the chin 
but it has fought back quite nicely said victor polce vice 
president and manager of corporate foreign exchange at algemene 
bank nederland nv in new york 
dealers agreed that most of the major government banks had sold 
dollars but they disagreed on how large the sales were 
some of the dollars drop against the west german mark came from 
continued speculation that the west german central bank would raise 
a key interest rate next month drawing global investors away from 
dollars and into marks 
in contrast the dollar rose against the japanese yen because 
fewer people expected the bank of japan to raise rates dealers 
said 
the group of seven consists of the united states japan west 
germany france britain italy and canada 
in tokyo the dollar fell 015 japanese yen to a closing 14280 
yen from 14295 yen at mondays close later in london it fell 
further to 14250 yen in new york it rose to 14235 yen from 
14213 yen on monday 
in london the british pound rose to 16215 from 16080 late 
monday despite tuesdays announcement of a worsethanexpected 
merchandise trade deficit of 229 billion pounds or 369 billion 
in august in new york the pound rose to 16190 from 16175 
monday

auto production and sales are dropping and that 
could mean layoffs around the time the united auto workers union 
begins gearing up for 1990 contract talks with the big three 
automakers analysts said tuesday 
the 1990 model year technically begins oct 1 although some new 
models have been on sale for months nevertheless some of general 
motors corps buyer incentives on its new cars and trucks took 
effect before the vehicles officially went on sale 
that suggests the industry is grappling with a host of potential 
problems in moving its product much of the recent focus has been 
on gm 
some of us believe that gm will close some plants permanently 
in the next few months said analyst john kirnan of kidder 
peabody amp co in new york he said the disparity between gms 
production capacity and its market share would indicate four plants 
could be closed 
last week gm announced it was idling its lakewood plant in 
atlanta in march joining recently closed plants in framingham 
mass kansas city mo and pontiac mich 
gm has scheduled some temporary production cuts next month at a 
halfdozen car and truck plants lasting a week or two apiece 
because of swollen vehicle inventories 
ford motor co has said it temporarily would halt production at 
a car and truck plant in early october chrysler corp hasnt 
announced any temporary plant closings for october 
analyst joseph phillippi of shearson lehman hutton in new york 
estimated that fourth quarter production this year would be 10 
percent to 15 percent below last years levels 
production cuts may be hastened by auto dealers who have said 
they wont be ordering as many 1990 vehicles as they did during the 
1989 model year there have been estimates that dealer orders may 
fall by as much as 30 percent below last years levels 
analysts also said recent sales activity including a 127 
percent jump in midseptember car and truck purchases reported 
monday supports a theory that current sales are being borrowed 
from the fourth quarter as consumers rush to beat 1990 model year 
price increases 
i suspect sales are going to be rather soft in the fourth 
quarter phillippi said 
softer sales point to lower production increased layoffs and a 
higher potential for labor problems in the last three months of the 
year as the uaw prepares for big three contract talks 
one uaw source speaking on condition of anonymity said tuesday 
that union officials werent alarmed but were monitoring production 
levels and possible layoffs 
uaw contracts with each of the big three automakers expire sept 
14 1990 preparations for the negotiations which open next 
summer begin in earnest during the first three months of next year 
by then the uaw will be looking back on any temporary layoffs 
and ahead to the closing of the lakewood plant which will idle 
about 2200 workers 
i think labor relations are going to be very murky in the next 
few months kirnan said 
in addition to potential layoffs one question is the kind of 
style uaw vice president stephen yokich the new head of the 
unions gm department will bring to the bargaining table 
this june yokich succeeded donald ephlin who retired under 
ephlins leadership gm and the union developed cooperative 
programs that injected worker participation in some management 
decisions but also created the uaws largest internal political 
fight in the past 40 years 
dissidents under the new directions banner have criticized 
uaw leadership for eroding workers rights through joint programs 
but new directions leader jerry tucker said he liked yokichs 
sharp criticism of gms planned lakewood closing yokich said the 
move undermines efforts to develop a new relationship between the 
company and the union

president bush vowed tuesday to continue his 
fight for a lower capital gains tax even if it prolongs a spending 
impasse with congress and triggers acrosstheboard program cuts 
he also said he would continue to oppose an unacceptable 
democratic alternative for a liberalized individual retirement 
account deduction 
a president has to use the tools at his disposal to accomplish 
the ends for which he was elected and i plan to do exactly that 
bush said 
house democratic leaders have coupled their plan to expand ira 
deductions with a tax increase on weathly americans and a more 
modest reduction in the capital gains taxes than bush wants 
the house is expected to vote on the issue later this week 
in a letter sent to all members of the house later tuesday bush 
reiterated that he would veto the democratic plan if it reaches his 
desk 
no matter how you dress it up that alternative is a tax 
increase plain and simple bush said in the letter thats no 
alternative and my response will be equally plain and simple 
veto 
at an oval office meeting with a group of business people whose 
support for the lower capital gains tax was evident bush said we 
ought to stand up to the understandable political rhetoric on the 
other side rhetoric that we heard all last year and that were now 
hearing once again 
bush was asked by a reporter if he would be willing to see 
extensive automatic spending cuts if there is no agreement in the 
capital gains battle 
i dont want that but im not ruling it out bush said 
the administration and some congressional leaders have suggested 
the fight over the capital gains tax appears to have dimmed chances 
of reaching a bipartisan spending agreement for the fiscal year 
that begins oct 1 
congress failure to enact legislation getting the federal 
deficit to under a 110 billion deficit target will trigger 
acrosstheboard cuts oct 16 in both domestic and defense programs 
if congress would go forward and do what weve suggested we 
could avoid sequestration automatic cuts bush said but im 
not ruling it out 
bush told the business people its a tough fight i obviously 
would welcome all your support which i hope i have 
he also said opponents simply are wrong when they argue that 
the capital gains cut is a break for the rich 
the administration wants to cut the maximum tax rate on capital 
gains profits from the sale of stocks real estate and other 
investments to 196 percent until 1992 the top rate would then 
be raised to 28 percent permanently and gains caused solely by 
inflation would be exempted from taxation the top rate now is 33 
percent 
the democrats are proposing allowing all workers not permitted a 
full ira deduction to write off half a contribution up to 2000 a 
year 
house democrats proposed financing iras by raising taxes on the 
richest 600000 couples and individuals saying it would be a 
windfall for highincome taxpayers 
earlier tuesday bushs capital gains proposal was attacked by 
consumer labor and government watchdog groups 
capital gains proponents are asking americans to ignore the 
unjustified financial windfall this tax break will provide to 
individuals who need it the least said fred wertheimer 
president of common cause a selfstyled citizens lobby involved in 
government ethics isssues 
congress is once again hearing the claim that there is nothing 
wrong with the economy that a tax cut for people with incomes over 
200000 wont cure said joan claybrook president of public 
citizen a ralph nader organization

the surprisingly robust dollar has rebounded to 
its levels of nearly three years ago but economists disagree on 
what if anything should be done to knock it back down 
a strong dollar makes imported goods cheaper for american 
consumers while hurting american exporters by raising the cost of 
their goods overseas 
while some economists applaud the dollarbashing efforts of the 
group of seven industrialized nations others say the groups 
attempts to lower the dollar are either inadequate or misguided 
the debate over the dollars proper level isnt just academic 
the dollars value affects everything from the trade deficit and 
inflation to jobs for american factory workers and the price of a 
bottle of imported wine in poughkeepsie ny 
the group of seven nations began flooding the market with 
dollars from their reserves after agreeing saturday in washington 
that the dollars rise in recent months was inconsistent with 
longer run economic fundamentals 
the central banks knocked the dollar sharply lower monday but 
continued intervention on tuesday produced only a slight further 
decline the dollar actually edged up against the japanese yen on 
tuesday in new york 
those who support attacks on the dollar say the dollar at 
current levels makes american goods too expensive in world markets 
and will cause the nations trade deficit to start rising again 
that could cost jobs of americans who work in industries affected 
by world trade 
i think it was highly timely that the g7 finally moved and at 
least temporarily has been able to sober the markets said 
william cline senior economist at the institute for international 
economics in washington 
but other economists favor leaving the dollar alone arguing 
that it is more important to focus on how well the domestic economy 
is faring right now they say the economy is doing well 
trying to knock the dollar down by flooding the market with 
dollars or lowering us interest rates could reignite inflation 
says that school of economists 
were walking a very fine line between making sure the economy 
gets enough juice and appearing to flood the economy with too much 
fuel said samuel kahan chief financial economist at kleinwort 
benson government securities inc in chicago 
setting policy in light of the dollar instead of focusing on 
economic conditions could throw off that delicate balance kahan 
said 
even those who support dollar sales by the central banks say the 
tactic wont work all by itself any more than a lion tamer could 
indefinitely hold hungry lions away from a pile of pork chops 
global investors will keep buying dollars as long as they 
believe they can get a high rate of return on us investments 
such as treasury bills factories and real estate 
worldwide currency trading has nearly doubled in the last three 
years to well over than 300 billion a day enough to swamp 
intervention by central banks over the long run cline said 
what we have to do is have the dollar come down as a 
consequence of a reduction in our budget deficit which would cause 
lower interest rates in the united states and it would be that 
mechanism that would bring down the dollar he said 
cline said he favors action to cut the trade deficit because the 
united states is in danger of eventually becoming another brazil a 
debtor nation forced to lower its living standards to make payments 
to foreign creditors 
but kahan said the united states is not just another 
country foreigners are accumulating ious from the united states 
because they see the country as a good place to invest he said 
we should look at the trade balance but not get overly wrapped 
up in it as a problem he said

precious metals fell and energy prices were mixed 
jon horton an analyst for research department inc in chicago 
said a lack of any real export demand for soybeans was weighing on

independent television stations tuesday took a 
swing at baseball owners for increasingly limiting television 
viewing of the american pastime to homes with cable tv 
recent agreements giving cable companies rights to new york 
yankees games and a fouryear 400 million contract that gives the 
espn cable network rights to wednesday and sunday night baseball 
games typify the flight of sports to cable tv said preston padden 
president of the assocation of independent television stations 
padden in a letter tuesday to francis t vincent the new 
commisioner of major league baseball said that given the clear 
trends in the cable industry it seems likely that legislation 
will be necessary to preserve sports on free tv 
but before that happens we ask you to consider mutually 
voluntary changes in the espn contract padden said 
specifically we are concerned about those provisions that 
restrict our right to broadcast baseball games on wednesday and 
sunday evenings 
padden disputed major league baseballs assertion that the espn 
contract would expand tv viewers choices 
fans will experience a diminution in the supply of baseball 
padden said more to the point you will be restricting access to 
major league baseball only to those who have access to cable 
andor can afford cable rates which average over 25 a month for 
the american pastime we find this contrary to the public 
interest 
calls to the major league baseball office in new york for 
comment were not immediately returned 
paddens letter grew out of a meeting this month in washington 
of tv station executives from 24 of the 26 cities that have major 
league baseball the executives agreed to try to get mlb to alter 
the espn contract 
the tv executives also were concerned about cable tv contracts 
for sports at big 10 pacific 10 and southeastern conference 
schools they said such contracts point to a day when all sports 
will be on pay tv 
the station executives have enlisted the aid of sens arlen 
specter rpa and albert gore dtenn to press their case in 
congress 
the national cable television association has said that local 
broadcasters are showing 40 percent more professional baseball 
games now when compared with 1975 and that cable is not siphoning 
away free tv sports

arthur andersen amp co and price waterhouse 
citing regulatory concerns and other problems announced tuesday 
they had scrapped plans for a merger that would have created the 
worlds biggest accounting firm 
a price waterhouse official who asked not to be identified 
said the key stumbling block to the merger was concern over the 
regulatory environment because the two firms represent so many 
competing companies 
however another source close to the talks who asked not to be 
named confirmed published reports that differences over funding of 
the firms retirement plans the name of the combined firm and 
other issues had hampered the talks 
in a joint statement the chiefs of the two accounting giants 
said the merger discussions were discontinued because differences 
could not be resolved within a realistic time frame 
joseph e connor chairman of price waterhouse and lawrence a 
weinbach andersens chief executive stated both firms have 
emerged from the talks with great respect for one another and 
better insight into the professional service environment in which 
they operate 
the statement said confidentiality agreements had been signed by 
both firms and therefore there will be no public comment by 
either firm on details of the discussions 
the firms originally announced merger talks in july amid a 
backdrop of other mergers among the big eight accounting firms 
aiming to face heightened global competition 
for example analysts say the firms want to be better positioned 
to compete once the 12nation european economic community drops its 
internal trade barriers in 1992 
arthur young amp co and ernst amp whinney combined to form ernst amp 
young now the worlds biggest accounting firm while deloitte 
haskins amp sells joined forces with touche ross amp co forming no 4 
deloitte amp touche 
price waterhouse and andersen announced on sept 5 that they 
would need more time to continue their negotiations 
industry analysts said the justice department had been examining 
the possible ramifications of an andersenprice waterhouse 
combination which would have merged the nations second and 
sixthlargest firms respectively 
one obstacle to the merger was the potential conflict of 
interest in the firms dealings with such major corporate clients 
as international business machines corp and hewlett packard corp 
the price waterhouse official said 
chicagobased andersens consulting division has joint ventures 
with both corporations to develop computer integration products 
while price is the auditor for both companies 
securities and exchange commission rules bar an accounting firm 
from participating in joint ventures with audit clients because of 
possible conflicts of interest 
the official of new yorkbased price waterhouse said the 
nonregulatory issues such as the differences over funding the 
retirement plans were not critical although it is not 
unreasonable to expect each side to have differences over what 
caused the failure to reach agreement 
the official said he wouldnt rule out renewed merger talks 
but not in the near term we might agree to look at it again in 
two or three years from now 
industry observers predict that the value of merging was great 
enough to possibly inspire the firms to deal with and possibly 
overcome the hurdles that scuttled the plan 
i continue to see tremendous benefits to there being a merger 
and tremendous negatives to both firms if there is not a merger 
said james emerson publisher of emersons professional services 
review in bellevue wash 
a merger would have created the worlds largest accounting firm 
reaping 5 billion a year in worldwide revenue and 27 billion in 
us revenue together the firm would have audited 40 percent of 
the fortune 500 companies 
anderson fell to the no 2 spot among us accounting firms 
earlier this year after ernst amp whinney and arthur young merged 
price waterhouse founded 100 years ago in london is the worlds 
oldest accounting firm

discoveries of new reserves and increases in 
exploration spending have helped the nations ailing petroleum 
industry turn toward recovery according to a study released 
tuesday 
arthur andersen amp cos 1989 reserve disclosures survey of 244 
public petroleum companies said the increases are the first such 
significant moves since 1985 
while this is far from a sign that the us oil and gas 
industry is about to return to boom times it does indicate that 
many companies have successfully adapted to todays low price 
environment said victor a burk managing director of the 
accounting firms oil and gas industry services 
burk said capital expenditures to acquire explore or develop 
oil and gas properties increased in 1988 by 53 percent to 246 
billion capital expenditures fell more than 70 percent from 1984 
through 1987 
in 1988 55 billion of the spending increase 65 percent 
was related to surveyed companies acquiring tennecos oil and gas 
properties with the tenneco deal the acquisitions of proved 
properties reached the highest levels since 1984 
us gas reserves also increased for the first time since 1984 
to rise to 1039 trillion cubic feet tcf in 1987 gas reserves 
had dropped for the fourth consecutive year to 103 tcf 
but in 1988 petroleum companies were able to replace more than 
half their oil and gas production through discoveries of new 
reserves 
burk said the findings show an industry making careful decisions 
about its future management is being very selective in choosing 
their development sites he said 
us exploration and production companies are repositioning by 
consolidating operations stressing technological innovation 
improving operating efficiencies redirecting exploration and 
development activities and investments and buying and selling 
reserves he said 
burk said companies continued to drill their best prospects 
and reported the lowest finding cost for new wells of the 1980s at 
770 per barrel 
i think we will continue to see improvements in 1989 burk 
said both oil and gas have continued to show improvements over 
1988 
burk said since arthur andersen began compiling data for the 
forecasts 10 years ago many firms have been acquired or simply 
gone out of business in the past five years he said 36 companies 
have dropped from the list of 244 public companies 
i think overall these are good things more positives than 
negatives burk said it certainly will have a positive effect 
in the amount of money people will spend in drilling 
meanwhile enron corp tuesday released a study that forecast a 
natural gas market of 19 to 21 tcf by the year 2000 arthur 
andersen showed that the leading public companies produced 94 tcf 
of natural gas in 1988 
enron officials said more gasfired power plants are likely to 
be built because of the bush administrations proposed 
environmental incentives for natural gas use

adolph coors great grandsons broke with a 
family tradition of never borrowing money to brew beer when they 
decided to buy most of stroh brewery co for 425 million 
but tradition is as strong as ever at coors where the coors men 
sit down to lunch every day in the dining room of the mansion 
adolph coors built more than a century ago on the brewery grounds 
as a 26yearold immigrant who left europe to avoid military 
service adolph coors founded a modest brewery on the banks of 
clear creek in 1873 just 14 years after goldseekers descended on 
the area 
but coors lacked the goldseekers gambling instincts his 
cardinal rules were to brew good beer and stay out of debt doing it 
over the years the founder passed on his cautious selfreliant 
streak to his son adolph coors jr and then to the grandsons 
william and joe coors the family business grew into the nations 
fourthlargest brewery 
the announcement monday that coors was going to pay 425 million 
for detroitbased strohs brewing assets represented a break with 
the past 
the deal will give coors 18 stroh brands five stroh breweries 
and two can plants if completed as expected early next year the 
acquisition will boost coors annual sales to nearly 3 billion 
coors would become the nations no 3 brewer behind anheuserbusch 
and miller 
to complete the deal coors will have to borrow an estimated 
300 million and because the coors family has assiduously avoided 
such borrowing throughout its history adolph coors co 
traditionally has paid cash when it wanted something the company 
has no bond rating 
still it is not expected to have trouble finding or repaying 
the money 
the company believes in a strong balance sheet if you have a 
strong balance sheet it enables you to make a move like we have 
with stroh rob klugman vice president of development for coors 
brewing co said tuesday 
the coors family controls 100 percent of adolph coors class a 
voting stock and about a third of its nonvoting publicly traded 
class b stock 
the stroh acquisition is a clear indication that the 
fourthgeneration coors brothers peter jeff and joe jr are 
firmly in control one year after the torch was passed by their 
uncle william coors and their father joe coors in a 
reorganization 
all five of joe coors sons attend to family business while 
peter coors 43 runs the beerbrewing operation and was the key 
figure in the stroh deal jeff coors 44 is president of adolph 
coors co and joe coors jr 46 the oldest son is head of coors 
porcelain cos 
the two other brothers grover 39 and john 33 have lesser 
roles in the family business grover heads microlithics a coors 
subsidiary that produces military systems and john is in charge of 
coors customer satisfaction division 
jeff joe and i are running the business said peter coors 
president of coors brewing co when asked what role his uncle 
william coors 73 the company chairman and joe coors 72 vice 
chairman continue to play in the firms daytoday operations 
despite the decision to incur major debt the coors family 
remains a strong believer in tradition every day that business 
does not take them out of town the brothers lunch inside the 
22room coors mansion the official family residence on the brewery 
grounds that adolph coors built 
that kind of traditionalism over the years has been reflected in 
the coors politically conservative image especially concerning 
organized labor 
a year after brewery workers union went on strike in 1977 over 
coors desire to subject its workers to liedetector tests coors 
replaced the strikers with nonunion employees that earned the 
company the enmity of national labor and triggered a national 
consumer boycott by the aflcio that lasted 10 years 
the boycott ended after coors pledged not to interfere with 
union organizing efforts at coors although brewery workers 
rejected the teamsters union in an election in december 1988 
joe coors a prominent conservative and friend of former 
president ronald reagan was an outspoken member of reagans 
socalled kitchen cabinet during reagans early presidential 
years 
an active supporter of anticommunist causes coors also 
testified on behalf of marine lt col oliver north at the senate 
irancontra hearings documents released during those hearings 
showed that a 65000 donation by coors wound up in a swiss bank 
account used to buy arms for nicaraguan rebels

opec ministers stepped up bargaining tuesday in a 
lastditch effort to increase the oil cartels production ceiling 
above 195 million barrels a day for the rest of 1989 without 
sending prices into a freefall 
the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting countries 
three times postponed what was expected to be a final round of 
talks to consider a new iranian proposal talks were to resume 
wednesday evening 
it has to cook some iraqi oil minister issam alchalabi 
said of the iranian plan 
but libya immediately threw cold water on the idea we will 
not accept it insisted a senior libyan delegate who demanded 
anonymity 
earlier iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh said his 
country had offered a plan to raise the production ceiling in the 
last quarter of the year iran suggested hiking the cap to between 
205 million barrels a day and 21 million barrels 
the ministers talks have centered on raising the production cap 
from the current 195 million barrel limit to a level between 20 
million barrels a day and 21 million barrels according to 
delegates 
the additional amount under the iranian plan would be divided 
under a formula that would meet the demands of gabon the united 
arab emirates kuwait ecuador and qatar for bigger shares of the 
production pie 
all countries would get larger individual quotas meaning they 
could pump more in the last quarter than now but some would see 
their percentage share of the total output shrink 
it seems there will be a little increase said a senior 
member of one delegation who demanded anonymity but we still 
have different positions its a slow process 
there are some members that are still taking a very hard 
line said another delegate also on condition of anonymity 
the meeting began saturday with the delegates arguing over 
whether the market was strong enough to absorb an increase in 
production without sending prices tumbling 
the cartel has been overproducing pumping more crude than 
allowed under an output agreement signed in june analysts 
estimate opec production at about 22 million barrels daily 
gasoline prices at the pump were likely to remain about the same 
or even fall a few cents in the long term if production were 
increased according to analysts 
the average price of a basket of crudes monitored by opec was 
recently about 1 under the cartels benchmark of 18 a 42gallon 
barrel west texas intermediate the major american grade has been 
trading at about 1950 to 20 a barrel 
the ministers were reported close to an agreement monday but ran 
into trouble getting all countries to sign on to the deal 
kuwait and the united arab emirates have been producing well 
beyond their individual quotas in an effort to press their case for 
higher shares others countries though are unwilling to give in 
to those two nations and want any increase shared proportionately 
analysts say kuwait and the united arab emirates have been 
producing as much as double their quotas of about 1 million barrels 
each 
the ministers could extend the current ceiling until the end of 
the year but analysts say that might leave the impression of 
disarray in the cartels ranks it also could prompt some countries 
to widen their taps to take advantage of the firm market 
opec has predicted that demand in the final quarter will be 22 
million barrels a day 
the ministers are to meet again in late november to hammer out a 
production pact for the first six months of 1990 
this weeks talks were officially held by a monitoring panel 
made up of algeria indonesia iran iraq kuwait nigeria saudi 
arabia and venezuela the other opec members gabon ecuador 
libya qatar and the united arab emirates were invited to attend

attorneys for two leading defense 
contractors battling over a canceled topsecret navy contract 
squared off tuesday in state court where they told a judge that 
millions of dollars hundreds of jobs and national security were at 
stake 
norden systems inc a norwalkbased subsidiary of united 
technologies corp is seeking unspecified damages in excess of 
15000 in its lawsuit against general dynamics corp of st louis 
norden filed the breach of contract lawsuit in stamford superior 
court in june after general dynamics dropped it from a program to 
develop the advanced tactical aircraft the next generation of navy 
jet fighters 
general dynamics is the prime contractor in the 4 billion 
project it had awarded norden a 114 million subcontract in 
january 1988 to develop an inair radar system for the new fighter 
jet 
an attorney for general dynamics argued tuesday that the lawsuit 
should be dismissed because it involves topsecret information and 
threatens national security but following two hours of arguments 
judge nicholas a cioffi recessed the hearing without issuing a 
ruling 
cioffi said later in his chambers that he needs to research the 
case before issuing a written decision he was unable to say how 
long the research might take 
herbert l fenster a washington attorney representing general 
dynamics said norden was dropped from the socalled a12 project 
because it was failing to make progress in developing the radar 
system he said he couldnt prove the claim in court because the 
navy has refused to release necessary documents 
very little about this contract can be described to the court 
since those matters are classified fenster said 
the attorney asked cioffi to dismiss the lawsuit because it 
threatens national security he explained that general dynamics can 
defend itself only by breaking the law and releasing topsecret 
documents 
cioffi however questioned that argument he said a court case 
can be dismissed on national security grounds only at the request 
of the federal government not one of its contractors 
if the government is so concerned why arent they here 
cioffi asked fenster said the navy hadnt formally sought 
dismissal of the case because it doesnt like to take sides in 
disputes between contractors but norden attorney peter b work of 
washington said the navy hadnt intervened because it expected the 
lawsuit to go forward 
norden can and norden will prove all the claims without 
classified information work said 
he said that when the contract was canceled in april norden had 
done 50 million worth of work on the radar system but general 
dynamics had reimbursed it for only 11 million 
work said the loss of the contract also forced norden to dismiss 
hundreds of engineers and other workers

four beer companies challenged adolph coors 
cos 425 million buyout of stroh brewery co on antitrust grounds 
tuesday saying they would file a federal lawsuit and seek help 
from the us justice department 
the buyout of most of strohs assets proposed monday would 
create a megabrewery capable of challenging industry giants 
anheuserbusch cos and the miller brewing co unit of philip 
morris cos inc analysts said 
coors is the no 4 beer maker and stroh no 3 the merged 
company would have annual shipments of 32 million to 36 million 
barrels a year compared with buschs 80 million barrels and 
millers 40 million 
that is too big to suit pabst brewing co a national brand and 
the regional falstaff brewing co pearl brewing co and general 
brewing co which together ship 7 million barrels of beer a year 
or about 3 percent of the market 
those companies which are owned by san franciscobased sampp 
cos said the acquisition would violate the clayton act and other 
federal laws designed to promote competition 
two of the big boys are getting together to make a bigger 
boy william m bitting general counsel for sampp said from his 
los angeles office 
its difficult to compete now and it will be damn near 
impossible to compete if this merger goes through bitting said 
youll wind up with no secondtier brewers except for imports 
momandpops and the microbreweries or tiny specialty brewers 
he said sampp cos would appear at a justice department hearing 
into the matter oct 9 and intended to file at least one lawsuit 
the merger of coors and stroh would be twice as anticompetitive 
as allowed under an index the justice department uses in 
determining whether to join antitrust suits bitting maintained 
rob klugman vice president of development for coors declined 
to make detailed comment saying the golden colobased company 
had not seen the language or the basis for the lawsuit 
in general it is our belief that this acquisition is 
extremely proconsumer and procompetitive klugman said 
combining detroitbased stroh with coors would produce a company 
with 187 percent of the beer market far ahead of the next g 
heileman brewing co which has about a 7 percent share 
jay nelson an analyst with brown brothers harriman amp co in new 
york said the combination would mean among other things that 
coors could more easily advertise and distribute its products 
nationwide 
the agreement would give coors most of stroh brewing cos 
brewing and container facilities and brands

two philips industries inc shareholders 
filed a lawsuit tuesday seeking to block the 750 million sale of 
the company to a merrill lynch amp co unit 
the lawsuit filed in montgomery county common pleas court 
contends that philips shareholders could reap a much higher profit 
if other bids were sought for the company before it were sold 
it also alleges that the takeover came when the building 
materials company was poised to increase its earnings and that top 
management had failed to tell shareholders the full extent of that 
potential 
the suit was filed by shareholders thomas roever of chicago and 
edith citron of palm beach fla as a class action on behalf of 
4300 stockholders 
jessie philips the companys founder and chairman announced 
the deal monday in which mlpi holdings inc will pay 2550 for 
each of philips outstanding shares 
philips spokesman william roberts declined comment on the suit 
the lawsuit which names philips and several other company 
executives alleges the deal was undertaken to allow some 
defendants to remain as officers of the new company while cashing 
out shareholders at an unfair price 
it called the deal an attempt by defendants to aggrandize 
their personal and financial positions and interests and to enrich 
themselves at the expense of and to the detriment of the public 
stockholders 
the lawsuit requests an injunction blocking the deal and 
unspecified compensatory damages 
philips manufactures components for buildings manufactured 
homes recreational vehicles and the transportation industry it 
has about 10000 workers in 50 locations in the united states 
canada and the netherlands 
according to the lawsuit there were more than 28 million shares 
of philips industries common stock as of june 7 it said jesse 
philips owns about 15 million shares or 54 percent 
philips who earlier this year announced plans to retire has 
said he intends to vote in favor of the stock sale

columbia pictures entertainment inc said 
tuesday its board will reconvene wednesday and may act on a buyout 
offer from an unidentified suitor widely believed to be japans 
sony corp 
trading in columbia stock was active for the second consecutive 
session on the reports that sony had offered about 3 billion for 
the film and television producer the rumored deal also boosted the 
prices of stocks of other entertainment companies 
the deal would be another in a wave of consolidation that has 
swept through the entertainment business in recent years as 
companies have sought to position themselves to compete in 
increasingly accessible global media markets 
columbia sony and cocacola co which owns 49 percent of 
columbias stock each declined comment on the published reports 
that sony was offering between 26 and 28 a share for all of 
columbias common stock columbia had about 111 million common 
shares outstanding as of may 31 
columbia was the most active issue on the new york stock 
exchange dropping 12 cents a share to 2625 on volume of nearly 
42 million shares 
columbia had jumped 525 a share monday when it disclosed it 
was in discussions with a third party involving their acquisition 
for cash of all of columbias outstanding shares 
on tuesday columbia said its board had met monday night to 
review those discussions and then adjourned until wednesday when 
it is anticipated that further action will be taken 
columbia and sony reportedly have been in talks for months and 
sony is known to be eager to expand its holdings in the 
entertainment field as a complement to its longstanding electronic 
hardware business 
sony has indicated its interest in buying a movie studio and 
columbia with a huge library of both films and tv programs could 
provide a lucrative new source of revenue for a company that has 
specialized in producing the videocassette recorders and other 
hardware on which to display those shows 
elsewhere in the entertainment group paramount communications 
inc rose 150 a share to 5625 mca inc climbed 2 a share to 
6562 and orion pictures corp rose 62 cents a share to 2275 
the rumored sonycolumbia deal highlights the scarcity value 
to the remaining independent production companies such as paramount 
and mca said harold vogel the entertainment industry analyst for 
merrill lynch amp co 
mara balsbaugh an analyst for smith barney harris upham amp co 
said upcoming technology developments by companies like sony are 
likely to expand global demand for programming to the benefit of 
companies that have large film and tv libraries columbia has a 
library of more than 2700 films and 23000 tv episodes 
over time there is a case for continued consolidation in the 
industry the list of buyers is a lot longer than the list of 
sellers she said 
these and other analysts said it was possible but unlikely that 
a third party would emerge with a bid that could scuttle a deal 
between sony and columbia 
one potential competitor has taken himself out of the running a 
spokesman for rupert murdoch whose news corp made an unsuccessful 
14 billion bid recently for mgmua entertainment co said 
tuesday that murdoch was not interested in getting into the bidding 
for columbia 
mgmua accepted a 15 billion buyout offer from the qintex 
group of australia earlier this month time inc is on the verge of 
completing its acquisition of warner communications inc which 
owns the warner bros movie studio and the tv production company 
lorimar news corp bought 20th century fox three years ago 
columbias columbia pictures and tristar pictures studios have 
captured 14 percent of the domestic box office revenue this year 
trailing warner disney and paramount but industry watchers term 
its performance disappointing 
its recent films have included ghostbusters ii the karate 
kid part iii casualties of war and lock up 
the new york times reported in wednesday editions that movie 
producer peter guber was expected to replace victor a kaufman as 
president and chief executive of columbia if the sony buyout is 
approved guber who coproduced batman rainman and 
flashdance is considered one of hollywoods top producers 
columbia has been more successful in tv programming and produces 
or distributes 11 series that are being shown in prime time 
including five new series they include whos the boss and 
designing women 
it also operates about 820 movie screens in 220 locations

venezuela has dropped its demands for a 50 
percent reduction in its debt to commercial banks and plans to 
offer new proposals in an attempt to revive negotiations with the 
financial institutions according to a published report 
the changes were detailed monday by miguel rodriguez fandeo 
venezuelas minister of planning the new york times reported in 
its tuesday editions 
rodriguez said an agreement was near on a 600 million interim 
loan from the banks the loan would enable the south american 
nation to meet some interest payments missed over the last several 
months in order to create the atmosphere so the negotiating 
process could speed up 
rodriguez interviewed in washington at the annual meetings of 
the world bank and international monetary fund said the changes 
were made to accommodate the realities of the banks he was 
referring to the different legal and accounting rules in differing 
countries 
he added that venezuela had not changed its position in response 
to moves in the last few weeks by three major us banks to 
increase their reserves for bad third world loans the moves by the 
banks were seen as making it more difficult for third world debtors 
to restructure their debts 
instead of its 50 percent reduction in its 21 billion in loans 
from commercial banks a goal the banks rejected venezuela will 
now offer the banks a broad range of options on debt reduction 
rodriguez said 
the options would include reducing the debt by various levels 
starting at 60 percent and going to below the 35 percent level 
negotiated in a debt agreement with mexico banks also would have 
the option of making new loans he said 
offering various debt reduction levels to different banks would 
make it easier to negotiate than trying to reach agreement on one 
number among all banks he said

seaman furniture co says it had agreed in 
principle with its banks on a partial repayment plan that would 
include a fresh 42 million investment by kohlberg kravis roberts amp 
co kkrs investors and members of the seaman family 
seaman went private two years ago in a 360 million buyout 
arranged by kkr but ran into trouble making debt payments because 
of a downturn in its major market long island 
the troubles of the 31store furniture chain came as an 
embarrassment to kkr by raising questions about how thoroughly it 
had investigated seamans prospects before backing the buyout 
the proposal announced monday would keep seaman afloat by 
slashing and stretching out its debt to banks and giving paper 
instead of cash in payments to junk bond holders until 1996 
creditors would also get an unspecified amount of seamans stock 
the deal requires approval by the holders of 90 percent of its 
junk bonds the banks have already agreed to it in principle 
seaman said 
news of the accord boosted the price of seamans junk bonds 
which had lost more than 90 percent of their face value its junk 
bond issue was trading monday at 110 bid and 140 asked per 1000 
face value up from about 70 bid before the announcement 
according to alan schlesinger head of junk bond trading at 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp 
the companys in wonderful shape now especially with the 
insertion of the cash morton seaman the chief executive said 
in an interview 
seaman said the company has opened five stores in the last 12 
months while closing one a news release said the refinancing will 
let it continue to aggressively explore new sites in 1990 and 
take advantage of the opportunities we see developing 
in exchange for 265 million in existing bank debt banks would 
receive 150 million in senior debt 25 million in subordinated 
payinkind notes and a substantial amount of equity morton 
seaman said 
the payinkind notes would pay interest in the form of more 
notes rather than cash until 1996 they would pay interest in cash 
from then until they mature in 1999 
banks agreed to receive payments of interest but not principal 
on 125 million of their debt from now through nov 15 1992 there 
would be no payments even of interest on the remaining 25 million 
until that date 
the investors who put in the extra 42 million would receive 
senior subordinated notes the share that each of the investors 
would put in was not specified 
owners of seamans roughly 83 million in outstanding junk bonds 
would get 208 million face value of new payinkind notes and 8 
percent of the stock in seaman in exchange for 90 percent of those 
junk bonds the terms of those payinkind notes were not specified

a record 1871 billion in debt securities was 
issued to the public in the first three quarters of this year as 
interest rates dropped according to a survey 
securities data co in a preliminary survey released monday for 
the first nine months noted that on the other hand the volume of 
common stock brought to market fell sharply the survey covers jan 
1 through sept 20 
the volume of treasury bonds and other debt securities issued 
jumped to 1871 billion during the first three quarters up from 
1814 billion in the same period last year and surpassing the 
previous ninemonth record of 1842 billion in the first three 
quarters of 1987 
the sales were stimulated by falling interest rates securities 
data noted when interest rates decline bond prices rise 
the rate on the treasurys key 30year bond for example has 
fallen from 908 percent on jan 3 the first trading day of the 
year to 823 percent in early trading monday the yield on the 
closely watched bond dropped on aug 2 to 784 percent its lowest 
level since april 1987 
while the total volume of bonds issued expanded junk bonds 
fared poorly during the period the consulting firm said it blamed 
the recent shakeout in the junk bond market for the smallest number 
of the highrisk highyield bonds being issued since 1984 
ninetyfive junk bond offerings were made during the first nine 
months down from 115 in the same period last year the total 
volume of junk bonds offered was nearly stable at 1928 billion 
compared with 1936 billion in 1988 but around 4 billion of this 
years volume was accounted for by the 2453 billion leveraged 
buyout of rjr nabisco inc noted francine wissak an assistant 
vice president of securities data 
new issues of common stock also turned in a lackluster 
performance according to the survey although the dow jones 
average of 30 industrials soared during the period surpassing the 
2700 level common stock issued raised only 135 billion down 
from 238 billion in the first nine months of 1988 
merrill lynch amp co inc continued to be the leading manager of 
new bond and stock issues with 17 percent of the market according 
to the survey

a new appliance that can chill beer keep ice 
cream frozen and cook pizza has college students clamoring and the 
inventor a former computer salesman crossing his fingers 
the microfridge offered by microfridge inc of the boston 
suburb of sharon is a threepiece appliance composed of a compact 
refrigerator a separate freezer compartment and a minimicrowave 
the product retails for 429 
the company founders did more than stack three appliances on top 
of one another and paint them the same color however their 
machine which stands under four feet tall was invented to use no 
more power than a compact refrigerator 
quite simply when one unit is running the other one is 
off explained cofounder robert p bennett 33 who said he 
holds two patents on the microfridges circuitry 
when the microwave is turned on the freezer and refrigerator 
shut off temporarily and resume when the cooking is done bennett 
said product testing showed that even when the microwave was on 
for 45 minutes the refrigerator and freezer sections gained only 
three degrees he said 
the first shipment of 1700 microfridges went out at the end of 
august and the company plans two more shipments by the end of 
november sales are expected to top 19 million this year bennett 
said and the phones are still ringing 
microfridge has three distributors which sell the appliance 
through colleges military bases and some retail stores the 
device whose components are made in various countries is 
assembled in san diego by the us arm of sanyo electric co ltd 
the japanese electronics and appliance giant 
the biggest problem is going to be eventually well have to 
think about competition said bennett once we create a 
market either well have built up until were the recognized name 
or we wont have that will allow someone else to come in 
for now the efforts of bennett and his cofounders peter 
soriano 47 and ed ward 37 are focused on promoting the 
appliance for use in schools hotels office suites and military 
bases 
more than 88 percent of the first shipment was bought by 
colleges and their students bennett said and students are forming 
waiting lists at brown university in rhode island and the 
university of southern california 
joseph zannini the executive director of housing at the 
university of massachusetts at amherst says the school ordered 11 
microfridges for initial testing welcoming the reduced power 
requirements 
lauren massara a freshman at brown university raved about her 
microfridge 
i think it could almost be considered a necessity if youre 
not on the threemeal plan you can make breakfast eggo waffles 
she said because of the microfridge in her room massara plans to 
go off the fullmeal plan she said 
relying too much on the relatively small college market could 
ultimately sink microfridge inc said chuck ryan an industry 
analyst at merrill lynch amp co ryan also said the retail price was 
high enough to be a probable stumbling block 
i think hes got a difficult sale on a price basis because 
college students can buy a 99 refrigerator and a 99 microwave and 
save yourself a lot of money said ryan 
according to bennett however a separate freezer makes up for 
that price difference 
how much is the freezer worth thats really the question and 
because we have an extremely high backlog it seems to be worth 
quite a lot he said 
marassa agreed you dont have to worry about this teensy 
space not big enough to hold ice cubes she said referring to 
the minute freezer compartment of most compact refrigerators i 
mean this can hold ice cream

a 425 million agreement in principle for 
adolph coors co to buy the no 3ranked stroh brewing cos brands 
and breweries sets up a big three among us beer makers 
analysts said 
coors president peter coors on monday announced his companys 
plans to acquire most of strohs assets and send a message to no 1 
anheuserbusch cos inc and no 2 miller brewing that coors is the 
one to be watched 
clearly we are in the beer business said coors head of the 
no 4 brewer in the nation if we are going to be in the beer 
business longterm weve got to be a major and significant 
competitor 
allan kaplan an analyst with merrill lynch amp co inc in new 
york said the sale will result in a big three of us brewing 
combining detroitbased stroh and goldenbased coors would 
produce a company with 187 percent of the market a tougher 
competitor for the top two and far ahead of the next g heileman 
brewing co which has about a 7 percent share 
jay nelson of brown brothers harriman amp co also of new york 
said that while the acquisition is not a sure thing it still 
faces several hurdles the combination would mean coors would 
compete better and benefit from economies of scale distribution 
and purchasing 
you may have more clout all along the line more bang for the 
buck in advertising and more bang for the buck in general he 
said 
i think the price is a good one for coors standpoint it 
looks cheap on the basis of replacement value of the breweries and 
theyre getting ongoing brands those brands are not generating a 
lot of income but consumers are buying them and theres some 
potential there nelson said 
coors officials said they expect to take nearly 20 percent of 
the beer market with the stroh acquisition and become stronger not 
only from a business standpoint but from a consumer standpoint 
the agreement would give coors most of stroh brewing cos 
brewing and container facilities and brands 
stroh brewing co will continue to exist but the operating 
company will not coors said golden will be headquarters for the 
entire operation 
the purchase by coors would be paid in part by the assumption of 
longterm debt and other selected liabilities with the balance 
paid in cash coors would not disclose the amount of either 
the plan would give coors the following brands strohs and 
strohs light signature schlitz schlitz light and schlitz malt 
liquor schaefer light and schaefer nonalcohol and lowalcohol 
brands old milwaukee and old milwaukee light red bull silver 
thunder and st barts a nonalcohol brand as well as the 
licensing rights to piels piels light and augsburger 
coors said he did not know which brands would be retained and 
which discarded 
primo a stroh beer brewed in hawaii and distributed in some 
west coast cities is not included and neither is sundance a wine 
cooler stroh also bottles other wine coolers and drinks that are 
not included the chairman said 
the move is part of a drive begun in the early 1980s by coors to 
expand from a regional to a national brewer the company now sells 
its products in 49 states and washington dc 
coors has 10 beer brands its main labels are coors and coors 
light 
stroh has been suffering its worst financial troubles since it 
went national by acquiring jos schlitz brewing co in 1982 
stroh was unable to make inroads on the growth of anheuser 
busch which dominates the industry with a 41 percent share of the 
national beer market far ahead of millers 21 percent and strohs 
11 percent miller is a unit of philip morris cos inc 
the 139yearold stroh has been looking for potential partners 
since february and announced aug 31 it was laying off 300 of its 
1500 whitecollar employees nationwide chairman peter stroh said 
the cuts were being made because the familyowned company had been 
unable to find a partner 
stroh also cut back support of civic and industry affairs and 
advertising including auto racing sponsorships 
coors would acquire stroh plants in st paul minn tampa 
fla winstonsalem nc longview texas and allentown pa 
can plants to be acquired are in winstonsalem and longview 
stroh also has breweries in memphis tenn and van nuys 
calif that will not be acquired coors said 
stroh plants are represented by the teamsters while coors 
workers rejected representation by the teamsters last december 
weve been in touch with the teamsters and will want to develop a 
relationship with them coors said 
the transaction is subject to the negotiation of a definitive 
agreement approval by the boards of directors of both companies 
and review by the justice department coors said closing is not 
expected before early next year

the government is asking united airlines to 
disclose how much foreign influence over the airline a planned 
employeemanagement takeover would allow officials said 
the inquiry came as the wall street journal reported that 
transportation secretary samuel skinner had asked northwest 
airlines new principle owner alfred checchi to cut by 225 
million the 400 million investment made in nwa inc the airlines 
parent corporation by klm royal dutch airlines 
the transportation department on monday gave steven m wolf 
chairman of united parent ual corp until oct 10 to furnish 
information on investors and financial arrangements in the 65 
billion stock buyout plan of ual by the airlines pilots 
management and british airways plc wolf is to continue as head of 
the company under the plan which would give controlling interest 
to united employees 
jeffrey n shane assistant transportation secretary for policy 
and international affairs asked wolf to provide detailed financial 
information including the names of any foreign investors and the 
amount of influence they might have over the new company 
the department is conducting a financial fitness review of the 
united deal to determine whether it will extend the airlines 
operating certificate under the new ownership a similar review of 
the northwest takeover was completed last week but the results were 
not announced to the public 
we are concerned about any aquisition shane said in the 
letter to united especially a leverage buyout of either the 
carrier or its parent that could have a substantial adverse impact 
on a carriers financial structure might otherwise affect its 
ability to operate safely or meet its financial obligations or 
would result in its not being controlled by us citizens 
on the northwest takeover department spokesman hal paris said 
he could not confirm the journal report or give any details of the 
departments decision on the buyout 
klm made its investment in nwa to help checchi finance the 365 
billion purchase klm provided 57 percent of the 700 million in 
equity checchi raised to buy northwest but owns only 5 percent of 
the airline 
foreign companies cannot own more than 25 percent of a us 
airline but skinner said last week he was concerned that foreign 
investors might have more influence than their ownership reflects 
and could compromise us negotiations with other governments over 
air routes 
the journal also reported that rumors about possible changes in 
klms northwest investment sparked a selloff of stock in united 
airlines parent corporation 
british airways plans to invest 750 million in ual 
the department in its letter to united asked for a 
citizenship affidavit for ual as it will exist after the 
takeover 
detail any actual or potential ability on the part of these 
noncitizen entities to influence or control directly or 
indirectly the affairs of united shane instructed in the letter 
he also asked for any written or oral agreements that might 
assure that noncitizen lenders cannot control ual
