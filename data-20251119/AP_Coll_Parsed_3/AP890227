the state commission on judicial conduct 
said monday it has instituted formal proceedings against a dallas 
judge who said he gave a murderer a lighter sentence partly because 
the two victims were queers 
the commission said a master appointed by the texas supreme court 
would hold a hearing on complaints against judge morris jackson 
hampton then report to the commission 
jackson said in december that he sentenced 18yearold richard 
bednarski to 30 years in prison instead of a maximum life sentence 
because the two men he killed were homosexuals 
bednarski was convicted of the executionstyle slayings of tommy 
trimble 34 and john griffin 27 who were found shot to death in a 
dallas park 
i dont care much for queers cruising the streets picking up 
teenage boys ive got a teenage boy hampton said at the time 
his remarks triggered protests from homosexual and civil 
liberties groups who staged a series of demonstrations and news 
conferences in december to call for his removal from the bench 
the commission said in a brief statement monday that it had had a 
large number of complaints in this matter

a british journalist says she and a colleague were 
arrested four times for clandestinely filming rural areas of romania 
wrecked by president nicolae ceausescus agricultural modernization 
scheme 
sue lloydroberts said she managed to save her videocassettes 
from confiscation by hiding them in her underwear whenever she was 
arrested and handing authorities footage of home movies the two had 
brought along 
she and colleague vivian roberts overcame stringent restrictions 
on foreign news coverage by entering the east bloc country posing as 
tourists she said 
her footage broadcast on independent television news showed 
empty brickstrewn fields where three villages had stood until last 
fall and a signpost with its place name replaced 
these villages appeared on older maps which were already 
unobtainable in romania ms lloydroberts said 
an unidentified peasant woman was shown describing what had 
happened we worked all our lives they destroyed everyones home 
my house was knocked to the ground theyve made us live in new 
blocks everything is wretched and miserable what can be done 
the report said people spoke of villagers being killed resisting 
militiamen who evicted them from their homes on 24 hours notice 
the demolitions are part of ceausescus plan to raze up to 7000 
of romanias 13000 villages and resettle the population in 
socalled agroindustrial centers 
ceausescu wants to create his communist man and he has to 
destroy the romanian village because thats where the opposition to 
communism is total ion rativ a romanian emigre leader in london 
told itn 
in bucharest the capital ms lloydroberts also filmed areas 
demolished to make way for a vast palace ceausescu is building for 
himself

this is as remote a 
place as you can get in africa the largescale map of the bayanga 
region shows only primeval forest crossed by rivers with not a 
single paved road 
in this heart of darkness hundreds of miles from the nearest 
village mans closest relative in the animal kingdom the lowland 
gorilla has found his last refuge a sanctuary of sorts from pygmy 
tribes and others who hunt him for his flesh and his hide 
the gorilla is an endangered species and theoretically under 
tough protection in the central african republic but the government 
has neither the money nor the personnel to enforce the protective 
laws 
there are two main groups of gorillas in africa the mountain 
gorilla in rwanda and eastern zaire whose habitat and life style 
have been fully explored and the lowland gorilla who remains 
largely a mystery 
the mountain gorilla can be seen from peak to peak and gradually 
allows himself to be approached as he becomes familiar with human 
beings 
the lowland gorilla is supremely shy and elusive explains 
richard w carroll of the yale university school of forestry and 
environmental studies in new haven conn 
carroll who has made the gorilla his lifes work rarely gets 
close enough to strike up an acquaintance in more than five years 
work almost exclusively concentrated on the lowland gorilla carroll 
has yet to get one accustomed to the human presence in the forest 
he estimates that a desolate area of 40000 square miles of 
forest where the central african republic cameroon and the congo 
meet may still have at least 90000 gorillas permanently settled 
there with the exception of rare logging camps along the rivers 
there is no human activity in this area and the gorillas have until 
recently remained undisturbed 
in recent years the logging camps have developed and there has 
been heavy illegal poaching for meat and the ivory of elephants 
who are the other main inhabitants of the region 
in the central market in bangui the central african capital 220 
miles to the east stands are piled high smoked monkey meat a local 
delicacy 
gorillas taste like monkeys only better said pierre somse 
who is carrolls pygmy guide and there is more of them 
carroll who lives in bayembe with his wife and 3yearold 
daughter has been trying to teach the pygmies why the gorillas are 
best left alone its an almost hopeless task 
the pygmies go after the gorillas with bows and arrows but 
larger africans those brought in to work the logging camps use 
rifles and even machine guns carroll said 
they bribe the pygmies to help them by giving them clothes and 
liquor in some areas we find snares made of cables stolen from the 
logging companies every few yards along trails used by the 
gorrillas 
the gorillas eat the fleshy leaves of the everpresent 
gingerlike aframomum shrub the fruit of tropical trees and the 
eggs of termites 
its quite common to see a 400pound silverback gorilla climb 
more than 100 feet up into the trees to get at the fruit carroll 
said they love that more than anything 
they will even build a nest up in the trees and sleep there 
in some areas on the ground gorilla nests are visible every five 
or six yards but the gorillas scamper away when they sense a human 
being approach 
carroll has been trying to persuade the central african 
government to set up a wildlife reserve in the remote southwestern 
tip of the country but in reality the effort is useless unless the 
other two governments in the area the congo and cameroon cooperate 
meanwhile the poaching goes on even poorly paid wildlife guards 
sometimes find it more worth their while to hunt gorillas and 
elephants and the dense forest paradoxically helps to protect the 
poachers from the guards 
it would help to be able to get a radio tag on the animals 
carroll said we have to crawl on our hands and feet to get close 
to them and even then we dont see them til we are a foot or two 
away with a radio we could find a place ahead of them and watch 
them coming 
he said the gorillas share 90 percent of human genetic materials 
and as such are by far the closest animals to man 
but he deplored the ineffectiveness of the present system of 
control and the inability of local governments and european and 
american organizations to stop the poaching 
recently we were in a camp on the sangha river where it forms 
the border with the congo a congolese gunboat came up the river and 
ordered us to get out of there we were clearly in the car 
central african republic but quite obviously we were interfering 
with their poaching

the justice ministry has refused to 
extend the visas of eight chinese businessmen who have been trying 
to gain a foothold for their operations in south korea press 
reports say 
the eight include hong cheong tak vice chairman of china 
liaoning ltd a hong kongbased trade arm of chinas liaoning 
province the south korean news agency yonhap reported sunday 
the agency said the ministry ordered the businessmen who arrived 
in december seeking to open company branches in seoul to leave by 
march 2 
yonhap said the move indicates south korea does not want chinese 
companies to open branches in the country on a longterm basis 
given that seoul and beijing have no formal diplomatic relations 
south korean businessmen are not allowed to stay in beijing more 
than three months and china prevents south korean firms from 
opening branches there 
china has promoted economic exchanges with south korea in recent 
years but has been reluctant to upgrade such relations apparently 
due to its ties with communist north korea

a train derailment caused an explosion and 
fire involving four tanker cars forcing the evacuation of thousands 
of people from a residential and industrial area near downtown 
sunday night authorities said 
no injuries were immediately reported 
the burning cars were among 17 that derailed from a csx 
transportation train at the bf goodrich chemical plant said akron 
fire chief george romanoski 
nine of the cars carried highly flammable butane csx spokesman 
lloyd lewis said by telephone from jacksonville fla the eight 
other cars carried nonhazardous materials including vegetable oil 
clay and sand he said 
allan franks a spokesman for the ohio environmental protection 
agency said one of the cars contained butadiene which may produce 
hazardous smoke when burned but lewis said the petroleum derivative 
was not in any of the derailed cars 
romanoski said fires in three of the cars and been put out and 
one car was still burning late sunday night firefighters had 
planned to allow the fourth car to burn itself out the accident 
occurred about 730 pm authorities said 
firefighters ran hoses up to the train to spread water on 
adjoining cars to cool them and diminish the possibility they would 
explode he said 
the area was evacuated because of the danger of explosion in 
the surrounding tank cars romanoski said 
at least 1500 homes in an area within onehalf mile of the plant 
were evacuated but the number of evacuees was not immediately 
available mayor don plusquilic said 
the evacuees were taken by bus to a high school and to the 
university of akrons memorial hall said scott swearengin the 
county emergency management coordinator

homes until the fire was extinguished he said he did not know when 
that would be but just as a yardstick were saying plan on 
being there overnight at least he said 
the train was not making a stop at the goodrich plant but was 
using its tracks to pass through the area said mike fletcher plant 
manager 
the train which had a total of 45 cars was en route from 
willard ohio to akron and back to willard lewis said he did not 
know where the trains next stop was scheduled he said the train 
carried a crew of three or four and that no crew members were 
injured

the large drug seizures announced with fanfare 
by law enforcement authorities are having little effect on supplies 
on the street with dealers simply absorbing them as a cost of doing 
business federal officials say 
historically a manager of drug couriers gives up one courier 
who is body carrying drugs to take your attention away from four 
more said bill norsworthy a drug enforcement administration 
agent at the el paso intelligence center 
people walk away from a brand new aircraft after one load and 
consider that an expense of the trip he said the same goes for 
boats automobiles campers they expect to pay a price 
a better way to assess how the united states is doing in the war 
on drugs is to ignore the ballyhoo about drug busts and concentrate 
on the price and purity level of drugs on the street says sen 
joseph r biden jr ddel 
for too long when weve asked whether or not our drug strategy 
is working the administration has cited record arrest and seizure 
data said biden who chairs the senate judiciary committee 
a check of price and purity of drugs on the streets biden said 
reveals that cocaine and heroin on the streets are much cheaper 
and more potent than they were five years ago 
in 1982 cocaine sold at the retail level at a nationwide range 
of 2000 to 3000 per ounce and was 50 percent to 60 percent pure 
said dea spokesman cornelius dougherty 
in 1988 the street price of cocaine had dropped to 500 to 
2000 per ounce and it was 80 percent pure said dougherty who 
said the information came from drug seizures undercover drug buys 
intelligence gathered and records seized 
the amount of drugs seized is not a dent in comparison with 
what is coming into the country and being produced domestically 
said dea spokesman maurice hill 
given the uncertainty over exactly how large the nations illegal 
drug market is there are very few solid numbers about anything 
which gives drug busts and amounts seized a certain cachet 
there is not even a clear total of the amount of seizures around 
the country the one number in the maze of drug statistics that 
could be expected to be solid one problem is that many different 
agencies may take credit for the same bust 
its a quagmire says coast guard lt cmdr jim simpson if 
you add them up youll find the government claiming it got 10 
times what it actually seized everyones trying to make 
themselves look good 
simpson outlined a hypothetical case in which the dea provides 
the intelligence on an incoming shipment air force radar locates 
the ship a navy jet spots the ship the coast guard tracks it and 
the final seizure is conducted by a local sheriff in florida 
even if everyone was trying to do the right thing and no one 
was trying to cheat it would still be a nightmare to sort out the 
various claims for responsibility even though the agencies attempt 
to note when they have assisted and when they have made a seizure 
alone he said 
this problem was noted in 1983 by the general accounting office 
the investigative branch of congress and some efforts have been 
made to correct it 
weve tried to get all the federal agencies to call into the el 
paso intelligence center where they give each seizure an 
identification number in case other police agencies claim it as 
well said hill who still acknowledged theres no real way to 
tell how much the federal government seized last year 
norsworthy who is special assistant to the special agent in 
charge of epic said that this program of giving each seizure a 
federal drug identification number does avoid duplication 
however norsworthy said epic has not been providing annual 
totals for federal drug seizures and the information it started 
collecting only recently is limited because seizures must meet a 
threshold such as a minimum of 1 pound of cocaine before they 
are given identification numbers 
in addition absolutely no one is compiling figures of local 
police seizures unless they choose to call in he said 
i dont believe that you will find a good true figure of the 
total amount of drugs seized said norsworthy 
robert s weiner a spokesman for the house select committee on 
narcotics abuse and control said hes not concerned about some 
duplication of seizure numbers even if its being done so agencies 
will look better and possibly get more government money for their 
efforts 
those guys need all the help they can get weiner said 
committee chairman charles rangel dny doesnt think you can 
overplay the danger and hard work the front lines in law enforcement 
have 
disregarding the likelihood of duplication the federal agencies 
dont make it easy even to add up what they each claim to have 
seized by maintaining different methods of calculation some compile 
figures by calendar years others by fiscal years that start oct 1 
some report on the number of pounds of drugs seized others on 
kilograms 
law enforcement agencies also repeatedly seize millions of 
dollars in drug profits that go unclaimed because anyone claiming 
the money would have to prove it was his and say where it came from 
hill said 
i recall a little old lady way back in the early 70s who handed 
me a shoe box full of 20 bills and said she was being paid to carry 
it to a woman in colombia norsworthy said the woman who 
disclaimed any knowledge of the contents or the rightful owner was 
allowed to continue her trip and the government got the money since 
no one claimed it

when a conservative activist told the senate 
armed services committee he had seen former sen john tower drunk in 
public he set off a chain of events shattering the assumption that 
the senate will protect its own no matter what 
illfounded or not the assumption was that the nomination of the 
feisty texas republican had relatively clear sailing in his quest to 
be confirmed as president bushs secretary of defense and that only 
minimal attention would be paid to decades of rumors that he had a 
serious drinking problem and a fondness for women to whom he was not 
married 
the testimony of conservative paul weyrich who opposes some 
tower positions on defense issues inspired a rush of similar 
allegations an ongoing fbi investigation was broadened 
the result senators were forced to take the concerns about tower 
seriously the nomination of the man who until three years ago was 
chairman of the senate armed services committee was suddenly in deep 
trouble in that committee and in the senate itself 
the dispute over tower threatens the spirit of bipartisanship 
which the president sought to build in his inaugural address little 
more than a month ago 
all 11 democratic members of the armed services committee voted 
no on tower all nine republicans voted yes 
a similarly partisan split is possible when the full senate 
votes in an attempt to prevent that and salvage his nomination 
tower made an extraordinary promise on sunday vowing not to take a 
single drink if he is confirmed 
but the struggle over tower and his alleged problems already has 
brought a large degree of unaccustomed pain in a legislative 
institution where progress is marked by the free flow of flattery 
in which all senators are invariably addressed as distinguished 
and honorable 
i can recall few equivalent instances on major issues in my 
senate career where my colleagues were so genuinely torn by the 
evidence and undecided in their position until the time came to 
vote said sen sam nunn dga the current armed services 
chairman nunn voted no on tower 
seventyone members of the 101st senate served when tower was a 
member 
none has come forward with a personal account of ever seeing him 
intoxicated or obviously out of control 
several senators all republicans have insisted the opposite is 
true that they have observed tower in periods of stress during 
latenight sessions of the senate during extensive overseas travel 
and on numerous social occasions and never saw him intoxicated or 
exercising poor judgment 
but others mostly democrats say they are deeply troubled by the 
allegations assembled during the fbi investigation 
these include nunn who when he marked towers retirement from 
the senate in 1984 suggested the texas senator might one day be 
deservedly selected as secretary of defense and praised him for 
the background and knowledge that are indispensable in the defense 
arena 
senators voicing concern over towers alleged drinking problem 
insist that his status as a former senator and as a principal arms 
control negotiator in geneva cannot outweigh concerns that a 
secretary of defense must be alert and ready to respond to crisis 24 
hours a day 
we must not overlook a nominees problems and subject him to 
less rigid standards just because he once served in this body 
said sen robert c byrd dwva the senates president pro tem 
in an interview byrd asserted that nothing has changed in the 
way the senate judges cabinetlevel nominees but added that a new 
set of circumstances has come to center stage 
if the same nominee had come to center stage 100 years ago he 
would have been rejected by his colleagues byrd contended 
but others saw two centuries of senate traditions under assault 
it seems to me we are on the verge of tearing this place 
apart said senate republican leader robert c dole of kansas who 
said unfounded allegations are coming out of the woodwork over 
the transom under the door 
we have to have some fairness dole said there could be 
some hypocrisy around here 
some senators say towers conduct in the past is being unfairly 
judged by the changed standards of the present 
this is a different era said sen ted stevens ralaska who 
says he never saw tower take a drink during working hours and never 
saw him where he was not in complete control of his brain 
the whole country is drinking less and that includes members 
of the senate everybody is more healthconscious stevens says 
we did drink more in the 60s and 70s he said we had 
more private time then and if there is any place that will 
bring up a drinking problem it is right here in the united states 
senate 
stevens predicts that the tower controversy will lead to a closer 
examination of the private habits of all politicians 
yes this has opened a can of worms he said but there 
will be even more of a can of worms before this is over 
people will ask all politicians do you have a drinking 
problem

seed prices are higher as farmers head into the 
spring planting season largely because of last years drought but 
also because of huge additions to the governments conservation 
program according to agriculture department analysts 
a survey of companies by the american seed trade association last 
august indicated that 45 percent of the planned seed corn production 
was wiped out by the drought the departments economic research 
service said 
to make up the losses many of the companies planned offseason 
seed corn production in southern areas of the united states and in 
south america 
according to industry sources the offseason production and 
carryover stock should provide adequate seed corn supplies for 
domestic use in 1989 if planted acreage doesnt exceed 78 million 
acres the agency said in a report however some popular 
hybrids may be in short supply requiring farmers to choose other 
varieties 
results of a survey among farmers to determine planting 
intentions this spring will be issued by usda on march 31 
corn plantings totaled 676 million acres last year 657 million 
in 1987 and 767 million in 1986 
two factors add up to planting costs acreage and prices and in 
most cases farmers are planting more acres this year and prices 
are higher overall the usdas prices paid index for all seeds 
is expected to rise 10 percent to 15 percent from yearearlier 
levels 
several seed corn firms have announced average increases of 10 
percent to 15 percent in the spring price the report said 
soybean wheat oat and barley seed prices tend to follow 
commercial crop prices which have climbed substantially since the 
beginning of 1988 cotton prices however have fallen over the last 
year 
the conservation reserve program which has a goal of taking 40 
million to 45 million acres of highly erodible land from crop 
production by the end of 1990 has helped boost grass seed prices 
under crp contracts farmers agree to plant the idled land with 
grass or trees as protective cover 
as of now more than 28 million acres have been signed into the 
crp with 90 percent of it to be planted to grass 
the report said that if yields of grass seed are normal this 
season the supply of new seed should increase but if crp and 
foreign demand for grass seed dont ease higher prices can be 
expected in 1989 
between 1985 and 1988 grass seed prices for timothy and annual 
ryegrass increased 124 percent and 28 percent respectively the 
report said 
meanwhile the reduced seed output because of last years drought 
has affected exports mainly corn and soybeans 
exports are likely to be down in 1989 while imports are 
expected to rise the report said however neither exports nor 
imports of corn and soybean seed typically constitute a large share 
of total us seed consumption 
however seed exports are valuable totaling a record of 374 
million in the 1987 calendar year up 1 percent from 1986 the 
report said the increase was primarily due to larger shipments of 
soybean and vegetable seeds 
the decline in corn seed exports in 1988 is likely to mostly be 
felt by italy mexico canada france turkey greece and japan the 
report said major soybean seed buyers are italy mexico canada 
turkey and japan 
while the full effects of the drought on seed corn exports will 
not be known until later in 1989 the two major seed corn export 
markets france and italy showed declines of 18 percent and 51 
percent respectively during the first nine months of 1988 the 
report said 
but those sharp declines probably were due to tighter sanitary 
restrictions imposed on imports by the european economic community 
the report added 
imports of corn seed up sharply last year have traditionally 
been mostly from canada and lesser amounts from chile but in the 
first nine months of 1988 chile provided 45 percent of the imported 
corn seed up from only 2 percent in the same period of 1987 
increases also were reported from hungary romania and yugoslavia

who bought it for a valentines day feast decided to spare it from 
the pot 
suzanne brown said the 14 maine lobster she dubbed oscar died 
this weekend 
gary gerontis a seafood merchant who had offered to fly the 
lobster back to new england so that it could be tossed back into the 
ocean told mrs brown on friday that oscar was terminally ill 
she said she gave him permission to put the lobster to sleep by 
placing it in the freezer 
mrs brown tearful over the whole incident said she feared the 
media attention she stirred up to save oscar might have caused its 
demise 
she said she told her story to the news media in hopes of finding 
a tank for oscar the story of the woman who fell for the lobster 
became an instant hit and oscar spent ensuing days under hot 
television lights a pen shoved in one claw to sign autographs 
everybody thought it was a wonderful story and it did make a 
lot of people happy she said 
mrs brown said she planned to bury the crustacean at point 
penrose state park 
her husband dave planned to help bury the lobster that was 
intended for his dinner plate while he supported her efforts he 
offered a final observation i never did get my dinner

congressional democrats are split over their 
budget strategy two weeks after president bush put them on the spot 
with a 116 trillion spending proposal that leaves many of the 
difficult questions unanswered 
some leading democrats lean toward cooperation with the 
administration perhaps culminating in fullfledged highlevel 
negotiations as the best way to forge a spending plan and to cut 
the deficit to 100 billion as required under the grammrudman 
balanced budget law 
house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif and 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine are among those 
advocating a cooperative approach 
my sense is that as long as the administration wants to discuss 
issues and look at options together were prepared to do that 
panetta said in an interview 
others including house speaker jim wright dtexas are less 
disposed to collaborate beyond the consultations already under way 
among white house and congressional budget writers at least for now 
some of these lawmakers argue that democrats can gain politically 
by continuing to attack bushs budget and say there is no hurry to 
work out a bargain on the spending plan just yet 
its the administration that feels an urgency to get things 
going says senate budget committee chairman jim sasser dtenn 
others including many liberals are even more militant arguing 
that domestic programs would fare better if the 
democraticcontrolled congress wrote its own budget an agreement 
with the administration risks having democrats share blame with bush 
for harsh cuts in popular programs these legislators say 
the bush budget has the rhetoric of a kinder gentler america 
but it has the fiscal numbers of an austere harsh america says 
rep william h gray iii a member of the house democratic 
leadership and the former chairman of the house budget panel the 
democrats have to come up with their own budget 
when bush presented his spending proposal to the 
democraticcontrolled congress on feb 9 he simultaneously asked 
the lawmakers to negotiate with him over its final shape 
congressional democrats complain that the presidents blueprint 
is woefully lacking in details especially on the cuts that would be 
needed to meet overall spending limits envisioned in the plan they 
say that before they agree to work out a budget jointly with bush 
they need specific figures indicating exactly how much the 
administration proposes spending on the hundreds of separate 
programs covered by the budget 
some observers however believe bush has won the first round of 
the public relations war 
do you really think joe sixpack thinks its unreasonable for 
the president to say he wants to sit down with congress and work it 
out asked carol cox president of the bipartisan committee for a 
responsible federal budget which monitors budget activity 
at the moment were boxed in says rep richard durbin 
dill a budget committee member the american people are looking 
at congress to make a move 
says rep bill frenzel of minnesota ranking gop member on the 
house budget panel its been a pleasure to watch them writhe this 
week 
some democrats say accusing bush of producing a budget that 
leaves about 10 billion worth of cuts for later bargaining and 
that makes only tiny increases in priority domestic areas will 
eventually pay off with the public 
gray and some other liberals say that rather than enacting bushs 
plan they prefer writing a democratic budget that gets half of its 
savings from domestic spending and half from defense 
that is the same formula under which the grammrudman law 
automatically slashes spending if the deficit target is missed and 
they argue that domestic spending would fare better this way 
some democrats fear that even if they negotiate a budget 
settlement with bush republicans will campaign against them in the 
next elections by blaming them for the cuts anyway 
if there are negotiations between the administration and 
congress a twoyear budget rather than the usual oneyear plan 
could well emerge this would get messy decisions for fiscal 1991 
out of the way before next years campaigns and free lawmakers to 
concentrate on policy issues instead of spending woes

conservation groups want president bush to 
reverse the record of his predecessor and revive a program to 
protect land around national preserves 
you can defer buying a car but a desirable piece of land is 
likely to turn into a shopping mall or become too expensive special 
areas bought today will pay enormous dividends for future 
generations says george t frampton president of the wilderness 
society 
a coalition led by the wilderness society urged the bush 
administration sunday to spend 781 million next year to buy land 
that might otherwise be lost to developers in and around national 
preserves in 46 states 
you cant keep putting off these investments frampton said 
the money would come from the land and water conservation fund 
created by congress in 1965 to protect natural resources 
congress may appropriate 900 million a year from the fund which 
gets 80 percent of its money from oildrilling on the federally 
owned outer continental shelf but purchases of land under the fund 
fell sharply under president reagan from 509 million in 1980 to 
206 million this year 
bush has recommended keeping investments at 206 million for the 
fiscal year beginning next october 
as an example of land lost to development because of delays 
frampton cited a 700acre tract in devils canyon in colorado which 
conservationists urged the government to buy for three years the 
land has since been subdivided 
most of the recommended tracts lie within national parks or 
forests and would not expand the boundaries of federal lands the 
statement said 
the recommended purchases include land at chincoteague national 
wildlife refuge in virginia olympic national park in washington and 
acadia national park in maine the santa monica mountains national 
recreation area in california and along the appalachian trail 
which runs from georgia to maine 
the only states in which purchases were not recommended were 
delaware kansas connecticut and iowa 
in addition to spending 781 million from the land and water 
conservation fund the coalition urged appropriation of 200 million 
in matching funds for recreation projects by state and local 
governments 
among the sites at which the report recommended purchases were 
santa monica mountains national recreation area 30 million for 
a total of 5000 acres in zuma trancas and corral canyons and 
elsewhere 
appalachian trail 23 million to buy land along the 2100mile 
corridor which is administered by the national forest service 
mt bakersnoqualmie forest wash 10 million to buy 620 acres 
near noisy creek some of that land contains trees up to 10 feet in 
diameter 
alpine lakes management area wash 96 million to buy 7750 
acres in the teanaway tumwater icicle creek skykomish valley and 
annette lake areas 
columbia river gorge scenic area 93 million to buy almost 
5200 acres on both sides of the columbia river 
olympic national park 4 million for 350 acres in the lake 
crescent lake quinault and coastal sections of the park 
chincoteague national wildlife refuge on the eastern shore of 
the chesapeake bay in virginia 35 million to buy 4350 acres 
including the barrier islands morris cedar metomkin and assawoman 
acadia national park 2 million to buy 500 acres in a boundary 
expansion area acadia is the nations second most visited national 
park after great smoky mountains park in north carolina 
goose prairie wash 700000 to buy 25 acres including the 
summer cabin of the late supreme court justice william o douglas 
in addition to the wilderness society the coalition includes the 
izaak walton league the national wildlife federation friends of 
the earth the american hiking association the sierra club the 
national audubon society and the natural resources defense council

one of natures most vicious spectacles the 
tornado is poised to renew its annual assault on america as 
changeable spring weather breeds the storms that spawn twisters 
last year was one of fewer than normal tornado deaths but even 
so more than 700 of the violent funnel clouds struck the nation 
in 1988 the nation recorded 32 tornado deaths down from the 59 
killed a year earlier and well below the longterm average of 99 
fatalities annually the national weather service reported on sunday 
but while thats good news it isnt an indication that the 
danger has lessened 
there is no way of knowing what this tornado season will bring 
but the way to survive is through preparedness said ed ferguson 
deputy director of the national severe storms forecast center in 
kansas city 
meteorologists have attributed the decline in tornado deaths in 
recent years to increased public awareness of the storms which are 
most common in may and june but can occur in any month of the year 
unusually warm and wet weather last november helped trigger a 
record number of tornadoes for that month at 121 across the 
country the average for november is only 23 tornadoes and the 
record had been 81 set in 1973 
last year also recorded the largest tornado outbreak in 14 years 
that took place on mothers day when 57 twisters tore through parts 
of arkansas illinois iowa and wisconsin that outbreak didnt 
cause any deaths although 10 injuries were reported 
arkansas and tennessee recorded the most fatalities last year 
with six deaths apiece followed by florida with five four people 
were killed in north carolina and two each in mississippi and 
nebraska states with a single fatality apiece were kentucky 
michigan missouri new york oklahoma south carolina and texas 
the transition from winter to spring spurring unsettled weather 
and frequent thunderstorms helps create tornadoes violently 
twisting winds that reach down from thunderclouds 
after a low point in the winter they begin to increase sharply in 
march and peak in may with a national average of 166 twisters in 
that month according to records kept at the national climatic data 
center 
june ranks second averaging 150 tornadoes followed by april 
with 109 in a typical year other months averaging more than a 
twisteraday somewhere in the nation are july 82 august 57 
march 50 and september 38 
hot weather stirring the air helps form thunderstorms and their 
tornadoes with 60 percent of all twisters occurring between noon 
and sunset according to the national center for atmospheric 
research tornadoes are least likely during the early morning just 
before sunrise 
the typical tornado is only about 50 yards wide and travels about 
two miles on the ground 87 percent of the time heading toward the 
northeast ncar researchers report 
but while an individual twister can cover only a small area they 
often come in groups and in the affected area destruction can be 
total 
the familiar funnel cloud is the most common sign of a tornado 
although adjacent winds can also cause severe damage 
when twisters are in an area common sense and knowing a few 
simple rules can save lives the national weather service says 
if tornadoes threaten turn on radio or television to keep 
current on the danger the agency says the weather service even has 
its own radio network which can provide continual updates if a 
twister is reported safety rules include 
at home seek shelter immediately in a basement or interior 
hallway stay away from windows and outside walls 
at school move to hallways and lie flat on the floor with head 
covered 
in a mobile home or trailer leave immediately head for a 
secure shelter or lie flat on the ground be wary of areas with poor 
drainage however because of the possibility of flooding from the 
thunderstorm 
at work or in public buildings head for interior hallways on 
the lowest floor or designated shelter areas 
in an automobile leave immediately do not try to outrun a 
tornado

the young businesswoman looked tense 
and worried when the morning papers brought the news of the 
cordobas fifth devaluation this year 
the governments latest devaluation of the national currency 
meant only one thing higher prices for food and transport higher 
costs for doing business yet another round of belttightening 
if we ate meat three times a week now well eat it once a week 
and so on until we become vegetarians the woman said toying with 
a pencil at her desk but even vegetables are expensive when you 
can find them 
the woman and her husband are urban professionals in their early 
30s with a small business they are expecting their third child 
in private conversations the two spoke of the hardships the 
middle class is enduring as a result of nicaraguas economic crisis 
and the thought that crosses so many peoples minds pack up and 
leave for the united states where many have relatives and friends 
the devaluation of the cordoba is part of the governments 
efforts to halt hyperinflation 
you keep cutting back and cutting back on the household 
budget but now im wondering what else i can eliminate the 
woman added 
and if thats us and people like us she said leaning 
forward to emphasize her point can you imagine what poor people 
are going through 
poor and middleclass people are leaving the country in droves 
undeterred even by a gettough us immigration policy that took 
effect last tuesday 
despite a tripling of the price for a new passport nicaraguans 
still flock to immigration offices 
a senior western diplomat said figures compiled from various 
sources indicate that from 1979 when the leftist sandinistas came 
to power through 1987 nicaragua lost about 8500 professionals 
the diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said about 
2000 professional and business people left the country in 1988 
alone despite the signing of a preliminary peace accord in march 
after seven years of war with the contra rebels nicaraguas 
population is about 3 million 
thats people in education business engineering medicine 
the diplomat said were not talking about ideology these are 
people seeking better horizons 
with thursdays latest currency devaluation the official rate of 
exchange became 3800 cordobas per dollar up from 3200 
at the new rate a typical monthly salary of 200000 cordobas is 
worth 52 many professionals earn up to 500000 cordobas a month 
which translates to only 131 a new passport costs 150000 cordobas 
with the lastest devaluation the price of a gallon of gasoline 
rose to 207 up from 176 a gallon higher fuel costs mean higher 
prices for food which is trucked into the city from the countryside 
shes been pressuring me for us to get out of here and go to 
miami the womans husband confided when his wife was out of 
earshot but i cant abandon my business now and lose all ive put 
into it 
he said that even if he wanted to sell hed be hard pressed to 
find a buyer 
to control runaway inflation that reached 20000 in 1988 and 97 
percent in january alone the government is firing more than 30000 
workers slashing public spending and tightly restricting credit 
president daniel ortega has summed up his governments attitude 
toward the exodus by saying that whoever doesnt like it here can 
leave for miami to look for democracy and ways to enrich 
themselves 
the us immigration and naturalization service has summed up its 
new policy aimed at central americans who usually come in illegally 
through texas by saying that anyone who cant prove political 
persecution will be denied asylum and immediately jailed and 
deported 
that policy led to only a small decrease last week in the number 
of people wanting to leave said sergio domingo prado who owns a 
travel agency specializing in trips to guatemala mexico and the 
united states 
he said he used to organize trips to guatemala buy bus but 
stopped because every increase in fuel costs increased the price of 
his bus tickets 
people didnt understand now i just deal in plane tickets 
theyre more stable he said 
his customers often make their way from mexico and guatemala into 
the united states 
on a recent evening people began assembling on a sidewalk in a 
lowerclass neighborhood of managua to wait for a bus to guatemala 
sitting on the curb in front of a travel agency were small knots 
of travelers and their relatives some were silent others cried 
lourdes maria rayo vargas 23 was leaving with her 15yearold 
sister and their mother they were the last in the family to leave 
their father and three brothers had left for guatemala four months 
ago 
i was the only one in the family working said ms rayo i 
worked in a supermarket then i sold shoes now ive been out of 
work for seven months

after three frustrating years swedes 
hope the mystery behind the assassination of prime minister olof 
palme is finally solved and that his accused killer will soon be 
tried 
prosecutors are reported to be worried however that their case 
may not hold up against the man arrested 10 weeks ago on suspicion 
of gunning down palme on a stockholm street on feb 28 1986 
they acknowledge that crucial pieces of evidence are missing if 
they have found a motive they arent saying legal experts say the 
case will rest on whether a chain of circumstantial evidence can be 
established 
the prosecution is in bad shape if they dont find the murder 
weapon or present other very strong forensic evidence said lena 
holmqvist a lecturer in criminal law at uppsala university 
since the shooting police have dedicated nearly one million 
manhours and hundreds of millions of dollars chasing international 
conspiracy theories centering on iran or on kurdish terrorists 
in the end the suspect they arrested was a swede a loner with a 
previous manslaughter conviction and a history of drug addiction 
alcohol abuse and psychiatric treatment 
the arrest dec 14 of christer pettersson 41 came as such an 
anticlimax that one legal commentator wrote in the dagens nyheter 
daily that the borderline between reality and fiction is being 
erased 
petterssons lawyer says his client has denied any connection 
with the slaying which occurred as palme was walking home from a 
movie with his wife lisbet who was grazed by a second bullet and 
survived 
prosecutors have released virtually no information about their 
case and petterssons name cannot even be published here under 
swedish press regulations 
but they have made enough headway to persuade a judge five times 
to extend the twoweek detention order against him 
there has been progress but we cannot make any estimate of 
how long the investigation will go on chief prosecutor jorgen 
almblad said two weeks ago 
published reports say the prosecutions case was built on 
witnesses who placed the suspect at the scene mrs palme has 
identified pettersson as the gunman but without absolute certainty 
the reports say 
if the case against pettersson falls apart the testimony of the 
few eyewitnesses would be useless against anyone else virtually 
destroying any chance of sending palmes killer to prison 
pettersson who was questioned briefly and released shortly after 
the murder came under suspicion again after police received a tip 
that his alibi was phony 
he has a long criminal record which includes the fatal bayonet 
stabbing of a man in a street brawl in 1970 
i think most people were pleased that we finally have found 
someone and are relieved that its a swede said ms holmqvist 
if its an ordinary maniac we can leave the whole story behind 
us 
under swedish law the case would be heard by the stockholm 
district court before a panel of one judge and five laymen each of 
whom have equal say on whether to convict a 42 vote is enough for 
conviction but a tie means acquittal 
the slaying of palme a fourterm prime minister who championed 
international disarmament jolted swedes from the idea that they 
were safe from the viciousness and terrorism that afflict other 
countries 
but the national trauma is fading last year people stopped 
putting fresh flowers on the improvised sidewalk monument where 
palme fell 
palmes governing social democratic party said it planned no 
ceremony to mark the anniversary this year 
the threeyear manhunt exposed some weaknesses in the swedish 
criminal system many swedes were astonished that a man with 
petterssons violent past was free on the street 
several parliamentary committees criticized the police for 
bungling the investigation for years police and prosecutors 
squabbled over who was in charge of the case since the law is not 
specific 
frustration over the failure to make an arrest also encouraged 
overzealous authorities to approve a private investigation that 
overstepped legal limits 
the resulting scandal forced the resignation of justice minister 
annagreta leijon in june and a parliamentiary commitee is now 
trying to find out how much unauthorized eavesdropping and other 
illegal activity was going on

a surge in violence has raised fears 
of a leftist revolt and renewed repression by rightist death squads 
in honduras which is squeezed between a civil war in el salvador 
and a dying insurgency in nicaragua 
since jan 7 bombings have injured 10 people three us 
soldiers have been wounded in attacks on american troops and three 
people have been assassinated 
honduran officials however are quick to point out that the 
level of violence remains low by central american standards 
we are not in the middle of a communal war said president 
jose azcona hoyo in an interview with the associated press health 
and education are more serious problems than violence 
but four bombings since feb 18 prompted the chief of the armed 
forces gen humberto regalado to announce thursday increased 
internal security and vigilance at public buildings 
americans are briefed to keep a reasonable profile and be 
cautious in their daily lives said us embassy spokesman charles 
barclay he said the instructions had not changed since shots were 
fired at a military convoy on feb 1 and a bomb was tossed at a bus 
feb 18 
about 1200 us troops are stationed at palmerolas enrique 
sotocano air base and national guard troops take part in frequent 
exercises honduras received about 115 billion in us civil and 
military aid from 1981 to 1988 
set like a keystone between nicaragua el salvador and guatemala 
honduras has frequently been involved in border problems and 
regional disputes most recently by helping ussupported contra 
rebels trying to overthrow the leftist sandinista government of 
nicaragua 
honduras has been the big loser in central america said 
efrain diaz arrivillaga presidential candidate of the small 
christian democratic party in elections set for nov 26 
some of the violence can be pinned on leftist groups like the 
cinchonero guerrillas but internal political disputes drug 
trafficking and machiavellian revenge theories also circulate 
creating an atmosphere of uncertainty 
no group has claimed responsibility for the most recent bombings 
carlos montoya president of the honduran congress said they 
are related to conflicts of an internal order 
he claimed the bombings are linked to drug trafficking and a 
recent police takeover at the central penitentiary where guards 
were accused of taking payoffs he refused to elaborate 
the most significant killing that of gen gustavo alvarez 
martinez on jan 25 was thoroughly professional he was blasted by 
six gunmen who knew his routine and the cinchoneros promptly 
claimed responsibility 
alvarez head of the military from 1982 to 1984 played godfather 
to the contras he was dumped by fellow officers and made an 
apparently genuine conversion to evangelical christianity carrying 
a bible and refusing armed guards 
he was an extremist maybe he went to another extreme said 
diaz 
many hondurans fear rightwing repression more than a revived 
guerrilla force in 19801984 when the cinchonero popular 
liberation movement was most active more than 130 death squad 
killings and disappearances were reported 
that is far fewer than the tens of thousands who have died in el 
salvador and guatemala but the specter of death squads caused an 
almost panicked reaction when the alliance for anticommunist action 
triple a distributed leaflets in late january threatening human 
rights and labor and political leaders 
we hope that the response to violence is not repression 
said felix molina an official of the center for human rights 
molina claims triple a is made up of army troops but the military 
denies involvement 
theres no evidence the triple a exists they havent actually 
done anything the leaflets could be produced by anyone said 
ruben zepeda the nations attorney general 
honduras was once the prototypical banana republic with bananas 
its leading export and revolving door governments it suffered 17 
coups or coup attempts in four years 
the nation of about 5 million is the poorest in central america 
illiteracy is estimated at 46 percent unemployment 25 percent 
inflation 30 percent 
border problems are historic 
when the sandinistas were trying to topple nicaraguan dictator 
anastasio somoza overthrown in 1979 many of their leaders lived in 
honduras in turn the united states used honduras to arm and train 
the contras against the triumphant sandinistas 
the contras operating from bases on the eastern border provided 
a buffer with nicaragua but now that us military aid to the 
rebels has ended honduras finds itself playing host to an 
unemployed army of 11000 and providing homes for an estimated 
140000 refugees from the guerilla wars 
there also is trouble on the western border where the leftist 
farabundo marti national liberation front is fighting the salvadoran 
government angry honduran officials say salvadoran refugee camps 
are simply guerrilla training bases 
street life in tegucigalpa appears unaffected by the scattered 
violence young men and women stroll the city center into the 
evening 
there are classic signs of rural immigration and underemployment 
pregnant women sell food on the streets young men sell trinkets 
and beggars ask car owners to let them spend the night in their 
automobiles 
murders increased 15 percent to 177 last year and zepeda said 
automatic rifles sold by penniless contras for 300 to 400 are 
showing up in the hands of ordinary criminals 
the people are scared and with good reason said the daily 
el tiempo in an editorial the assassinations are an unequivocal 
sign that we are in the shadow of what could quickly develop into 
major bloodshed as happened in guatemala and el salvador

prime minister margaret thatchers government seems 
to have hit a rough patch as its capitalist crusade begins to bite 
into the heart of british society 
with the socialist and centrist opposition divided the 
conservatives continue to look unassailable 
but some analysts say the governments prestige is threatened by 
rising inflation and interest rates coupled with contentious 
reforms of fundamental institutions including the health service 
education and the legal profession 
they see a warning light in the result of thursdays byelection 
to fill the vacant parliamentary seat of richmond in northern 
england 
the tories won but their thumping 19576vote majority in the 
june 1987 general election was slashed to 2634 against a stunning 
resurgence of the centrist democrats and social democrats 
it was the biggest antitory swing in any constituency since mrs 
thatcher came to office in may 1979 
united the centrists could have taken the seat easily but they 
are deeply divided 
labor the main opposition party limped in with fewer than 3000 
votes a predictable result in a wealthy rural constituency like 
richmond 
but in another byelection thursday in wales labor saw its 
majority slip by about 6500 votes against a much strengthened 
showing by plaid cymru the separatist welsh nationalist party 
tory analysts say the richmond result is not surprising for a 
government nearing midterm when byelections often become 
instruments for registering protest votes 
the conservative daily telegraph dismissed the result as a mild 
bout of midterm unpopularity 
but the liberal observer while agreeing that midterm setbacks do 
not diminish the governments underlying strength also looked at 
the opinion polls and said perhaps the tide is turning at last 
a gallup poll in the sunday telegraph put labor and the tories at 
35 percent each in terms of public preference while a harris poll 
for the observer put labor one point ahead of the tories at 42 
percent 
the observer said its poll of 1027 respondents put labor ahead 
for the first time since october 1986 and was labors best showing 
since 1983 
the telegraph did not say how many people were questioned and 
neither paper reported a margin of error 
in the june 1987 general election the conservatives took 423 
percent of the vote to labors 308 percent and won a 102seat 
parliamentary majority in the 650seat house of commons the next 
general election must be held by mid1992 but will likely be held 
sooner 
the conservative party is now losing a very large number of 
votes said professor ivor crewe an essex university analyst 
but these votes are being dissipated across more than one 
party in other words theyre losing votes but they can still 
expect to go on gaining seats on a minority vote just as they did in 
richmond he told british broadcasting corp television 
in seeking to revamp the health service legal professions and 
schools and inject them with a measure of private competition the 
government is signaling that far from losing stamina after a decade 
in office its reforming zeal is stronger than ever 
the tories say they want to broaden consumer choice and break 
down entrenched bureaucracies 
but another sunday telegraph gallup poll published last week 
found a large majority of teachers doctors and lawyers opposing the 
reforms and a 7 percent swing in their voting intentions from the 
tories to labor 
the governments prestige is suffering from an annual inflation 
rate above 7 percent and a prime lending rate of 14 percent 
also its bold plans to sell off the water supply in england and 
wales as part of its privatization drive is proving unpopular 
consumers fear a sharp rise in water prices if the industry is to be 
profitable on the open market 
the richmond result said the middleoftheroad independent 
newspaper is certainly not an indication of irreversible decline 
in this case an energetic administration is busily forcing a 
great deal of highly contentious legislation through parliament 
much of it disturbing to middleclass voters 
even the usually progovernment times of london warned that the 
loss of popularity stemmed not just from midterm doldrums but from 
public suspicion of water privatization health service 
restructuring and inflation 
the government faces a period of highly sensitive public 
relations it said and must justify its policies convincingly

president jose napoleon duarte 
on sunday called for a ceasefire and peace talks with leftist 
rebels who have offered to take part in national elections set for 
march if the vote is postponed 
duarte said on nationwide television and radio that if the talks 
prove inconclusive on the postponement issue he favors resolving it 
with a referendum 
the president proposed that the usbacked government and the 
rebel farabundo marti liberation front unilaterally cease 
hostilities between feb 28 and june 1 and begin peace talks 
tuesday in guatemala 
the rebels offered on jan 24 to take part in elections and 
recognize the results if the vote were postponed from march 19 
until september and if their security is guaranteed and electoral 
changes are made to ensure a fair vote 
in an unprecedented meeting in mexico last week they told 
salvadoran political leaders that they would lay down their arms if 
the election were postponed at least four months the armed forces 
sharply reduced and the police reorganized they also proposed 
direct talks with duarte 
there was no immediate rebel reaction to duartes comments sunday 
in his speech duarte suggested that the guerrillas be 
incorporated into salvadoran society and politics and that the 
salvadorn armed forces be recognized as the only army in the country 
he did not refer directly to the guerrilla proposal but he said 
he would propose that the presidential balloting be postponed until 
april 30 he did not specify when a plebiscite might take place 
duarte said the delegation to peace talks would include 
representatives from the legislature which is dominated by the 
rightwing national republican alliance and the 13 political 
parties 
he did not say whether he would participate in the talks or name 
a representative 
he also did not explain why he suddenly changed his position of 
strongly opposing any delay in the elections 
proposing the referendum duarte said sovereignty rests with the 
salvadoran people and for this reason a solution is possible 
through consulting the people 
he said another way to postpone elections legally would be for 
the executive legislative and judicial branches of the government 
to all agree on a legal mechanism to bring about a postponement 
he implied the presidential polling could not be postponed beyond 
april 30 
duarte and the armed forces have been saying that a delay in the 
vote would be unconstitutional and military leaders have suggested 
publicly they may take over if the vote did not go on as scheduled 
el salvadors constitution specifies that a new president is to 
take office on june 1 
duarte initially said he would let the political parties decide 
on the matter last monday and tuesday a delegation of salvadoran 
political leaders met in mexico with rebel leaders 
the meetings were cordial but ended without any agreement 
the guerrillas contend that the politicial parties are hiding 
behind the constitution to avoid substantive talks 
more than 70000 people most of them civilians have died in 
9yearold war between the government and the leftist rebels 
the guerrillas have steadfastly rejected the five national 
elections this decade as part of a usbacked counterinsurgency 
campaign 
duarte said in his speech sunday it was necessary to initiate a 
new search to put an end to the armed conflict that is covering our 
country with blood 
he also said he had no personal ambitions in the matter i beg 
of god that he lets our people find peace

president bush after giving human rights apparent 
backburner treatment in talks with chinese leaders told the vice 
premier today he thought it was wrong for authorities to bar a 
leading dissident from attending a dinner he hosted 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush also 
directed us ambassador winston lord to seek a meeting with the 
chinese foreign ministry to learn why fang lizhi an astrophysicist 
and prominent human rights activist was intercepted as he tried to 
go into the dinner 
fitzwater said bush learned of incident today the day after it 
happened and that he expressed regret to vice premier wu 
xueqian just before boarding air force one for seoul south korea 
police used the pretext of a traffic violation to stop a car 
carrying the 53yearold fang to the banquet sunday night halted a 
taxi that he transferred to and ordered a public bus not to pick him 
up they insisted he was not on the guest list although the official 
us list bore his name 
police then tailed him his wife and an american couple perry 
link a professor of chinese literature and his wife for an hour 
and a half as they walked to lords residence to seek help 
us embassy spokesman sheridan w bell said that lord was in 
the process of requesting a meeting with the foreign ministry to 
discuss the incident which shocked and dismayed other outspoken 
chinese intellectuals 
he refused to disclose what message lord would give the ministry 
or to characterize the degree of seriousness with which the incident 
was being treated 
fitzwater said that bush felt the chinese trip had gone well 
generally and said the president takes the view that such problems 
as human rights should be dealt with in a lowkey and private manner 
contradicting a statement he made a day earlier fitzwater also 
said that bush did raise the issue of human rights problems 
privately in china but the president also heard communist party 
leader zhao ziyang lecture him about how dissidents were undermining 
economic reform in his country 
in a telephone interview late sunday fang said the police action 
was foolish and showed the government was weak and afraid of the 
growing vocalism of a small but growing community of disaffected 
intellectuals 
its a normal thing to attend a banquet but the authorities 
here are afraid of even that fang said 
fang an internationally known astrophysicist frequently referred 
to as the andrei sakharov of china was one of several government 
critics whom the white house invited to the banquet at a local hotel 
in an apparent gesture of support 
the others including leading marxist theorist su shaozhi and 
playwright wu zuguang attended without interference but none is 
as wellknown outside china as fang who stepped into the political 
limelight in 1986 with eloquent speeches to college students 
calling for democracy and human rights 
copies and tapes of fangs speeches rapidly spread unofficially 
from campus to campus and the government blamed him for a later 
nationwide wave of student demonstrations in the winter of 198687 
he was expelled from the ruling communist party and fired as vice 
president of a leading scientific university 
chinas official media did not report the police action against 
fang on monday and the foreign ministry and public security ministry 
refused to comment immediately 
the official xinhua news agency issued a commentary describing 
bushs visit as an unusual diplomatic initiative because it came 
so early in his presidency and said he was given a warm and 
friendly reception 
however it added as the chinese leaders pointed out during 
the meetings some americans are prone to impose their 
unreasonable views on matters concerning chinas internal affairs 
zhao told bush in unusually blunt langage that any us support 
for chinese dissidents would be detrimental to chineseus 
friendship according to xinhua 
fang now works at the beijing observatory on a trip to australia 
last summer he alluded to widespread unofficial reports that 
chinese leaders and their children maintain foreign bank accounts 
in apparent retaliation the government withdrew permission for him 
to travel to the united states to take part in an academic seminar 
and to teach 
fang recently sent an open letter to senior chinese leader deng 
xiaoping calling for amnesty for political prisoners and the call 
was taken up by several other leading writers and thinkers who sent 
a followup letter

nearly a decade after the three mile island 
accident half those polled believe another serious nuclear power 
accident is likely and eight in 10 people favor stricter safety 
standards 
an associated pressmedia general survey found support for 
continued use of nuclear plants now operating but most opposed 
building new plants or starting up completed plants that are not yet 
in operation 
overall 55 percent said they supported use of nuclear power to 
generate electricity 
but 56 percent of the 1162 adults polled said it is impossible 
to store radioactive waste from nuclear plants safely and while 
most said the plants are safer now than a decade ago 50 percent 
called an accident likely 
the national poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 
percentage points 
the survey was conducted jan 412 in anticipation of the 10th 
anniversary of the nations worst commercial nuclear accident the 
three mile island accident which began march 28 1979 destroyed a 
reactor at the middletown pa plant 
considerably tighter federal regulation of the commercial nuclear 
power industry followed the accident and a solid 63 percent in the 
poll said they believed us nuclear plants are safer than they were 
10 years ago 
nonetheless an overwhelming 79 percent said the federal 
government should be even tougher when it comes to enforcing nuclear 
safety rules and 62 percent said governors should be empowered to 
shut down nuclear plants in their states 
backing for nuclear power was markedly higher among men and 
republicans twothirds of those groups supported nuclear power 
generally compared with half the democrats and independents and 
just 45 percent of the women polled 
when asked to rate the chance of a serious accident at a us 
nuclear plant 11 percent overall chose highly likely and 39 
percent said an accident was likely for a total of 50 percent 
thirty percent said unlikely and 14 percent said highly 
unlikely for a total of 44 percent the rest had no opinion 
six in 10 women and as many democrats called an accident likely 
compared with four in 10 of the men and the republicans among 
respondents with postgraduate schooling just 37 percent called an 
accident likely that swelled to 58 percent of those who has not 
gone beyond high school 
overall only a third said more nuclear plants should be built in 
the united states of those who favored more plants threequarters 
said they would accept one within 10 miles of their home the 
government has not issued any new permits to build nuclear power 
plants since 1979 
just two in 10 said nuclear plants that have been completed but 
not yet licensed should be allowed to open such plants in seabrook 
nh and shoreham ny have been stalled in part by opposition 
from gov mario cuomo of new york and in seabrooks case gov 
michael dukakis of neighboring massachusetts 
a governor is not empowered to close a plant outright in the 
poll however six in 10 said a governor should have the authority 
to prevent a nuclear power plant from opening in his or her state 
and as many said a governor should be empowered to shut down an 
operating plant 
just 9 percent said the nations 108 fully operating commercial 
nuclear power plants should be closed down immediately 48 percent 
said they should continue to operate and 35 percent said they should 
be phased out gradually eight percent had no opinion 
of those who wanted the plants phased out a third wanted it done 
within five years about a third within 10 years and the rest would 
allow longer

in currency dealings the dollars low opening followed its 
weakness in fridays new york trading despite the federal reserve 
action to raise its discount rate dealers said 
the feds rate hike dissappointed new york financial markets 
because american market players had hoped it would go further than a 
halfpercentagepoint hike said foreign exchange traders the move 
was also seen as coming too late 
tokyo foreign exchange dealers were unimpressed as well traders 
said that a rate hike had been expected and was fully discounted 
higher us interest rates tend to make the dollar more 
attractive to foreign investors but fridays us interest rate 
hike did not lead japanese market players to the dollarbuying said 
one dealer with a commercial bank in tokyo 
meanwhile japanese finance minister tatsuo murayama indicated 
monday that there is no need for japan to follow the us discount 
rate hike with a rate hike of its own kyodo news service reported

president jose napoleon duarte 
has accepted leftist rebels proposal to hold direct peace talks 
calling for them to begin tuesday in guatemala with a threemonth 
ceasefire in place 
in a nationwide television and radio address sunday night duarte 
also addressed the guerrillas offer to participate in and accept 
the results of the presidential election if it is postponed for at 
least four months 
he advocated postponing the vote which is scheduled for march 
19 until april 30 and proposed that a referendum be held on the 
issue if the government and rebels cannot resolve it in talks 
duarte did not say when such a plebiscite might take place 
a meeting in guatemala would be the first direct negotiations 
since october 1987 between the usbacked government and the 
insurgents it has been fighting for nine years the last talks ended 
in stalemate 
duarte 63 said he was proposing a new search to put an end to 
the armed conflict that is covering our country with blood 
proposing that a ceasefire begin tuesday and run at least through 
june 1 
the civil war has killed an estimated 70000 people most of them 
civilians 
there was no immediate comment from the rebels on duartes 
proposal 
the faribundo marti national liberation front a revolutionary 
army of about 7000 combatants proposed last month that the 
presidential vote be put off until september 
the offer was a dramatic turnabout and the bush administration 
said it was worthy of serious and substantive consideration 
the rebels have boycotted and condemned all five previous 
national elections this decade contending they have not been free 
and fair and were part of a usimposed plan to put a civilian 
facade on a militarydominated government 
the insurgents during talks with representatives of political 
parties in mexico last week indicated they would be willing to 
accept an election as early as july they said they needed at least 
four months to shift from a military to an electoral campaign 
the rebels also offered to lay down their arms if the countrys 
armed forces were significantly cut and the police force reorganized 
duarte a christian democrat said sunday that the legislature 
should name three representatives to take part in the guatemala 
talks he said the 13 parties should name one person to participate 
he did not say if he would head the government delegation nor 
how many members of the executive branch would take part 
the legislature is controlled by the rightist republican 
nationalist alliance or arena which is favored to win the 
presidential election 
arena has adamantly refused to accept any postponment of the vote 
the army the countrys most powerful institution also has said 
postponement of the election would be unconstitutional and 
threatened to take power if voting is postponed 
when the guerrillas made their original proposal jan 24 duarte 
said postponement of the elections beyond march 31 would be 
unconstitutional the constitution says the vote must take place at 
least two months before the end of the incumbents term which is 
june 1 
duarte did not provide any explanation as to why april 30 would 
be any more constitutional than a later date he reiterated that he 
would step down june 1 
the legislature is empowered to name an interim president if 
there is no presidentelect to take power june 1 
the president who suffers from terminal liver cancer said the 
guatemala talks would intend to end the war incorporate the rebels 
into the political sphere and achieve the recognition by the 
guerrillas of the government armed forces as the countrys only 
legitimate military organization

forces if it were reduced from its current strength of 56000 to the 
1980 level of 12000

a failed lock may have caused a united airlines 
jumbo jets cargo door to pop open at 22000 feet ripping a huge 
hole up the side of the plane and sending nine passengers to their 
deaths federal investigators say 
damage to the plane is consistent with the cargo door popping 
open under pressurization of the cabin as the jet gained altitude 
and atmospheric pressure outside the aircraft declined 
investigators said late saturday 
we are focusing on and looking at the latching mechanism 
said lee dickinson a national transportation safety board 
investigator 
one cargo door latch attached to the fuselage was removed sunday 
and will be compared to latches on other boeing 747s he said the 
10by10foot cargo door has 10 latches eight on the bottom and two 
on the sides as well as two hook pins on each side 
were also trying to get a better handle on these latch pin 
supports and comparing them to others dickinson said 
asked whether it would be possible to determine the cause of the 
accident without the door he said obviously if we had the door it 
would be very helpful to us but there is other information that 
is helpful he said 
more than 70 investigators including 16 from the ntsb worked 
sunday on finding the cause of the accident but the coast guard 
suspended a sea and air search 100 miles south of honolulu after 
finding more debris from the plane 
coast guard lt brad nelson said the search was hampered by high 
seas theres probably not a lot more that can be picked up he 
said 
united flight 811 carrying 354 people had taken off friday for 
new zealand and was about 100 miles from honolulu when the fuselage 
ripped open over the pacific ocean nine passengers were sucked out 
and are presumed dead 
the pilot lost power in one of the four engines and shut down 
another when a fire indicator light went on but the plane returned 
safely to honolulu 
united announced sunday that it had begun a series of special 
maintenance checks on its aircraft united chairman stephen m wolf 
said the maintenance checks are over and above uniteds existing 
procedures and those required by the federal aviation 
administration 
he also said an faalicensed mechanic will inspect each 747 cargo 
door after a landing and will oversee the closing of each 747 cargo 
door before departures the closings have been handled by ramp 
personnel his statement said 
two cutters returned to port sunday morning with items recovered 
by then including part of an overhead compartment a section of 
fuselage and two seats 
also found were safety instruction cards and personal items 
including shoes and a teddy bear said lt cmdr paul ellner a 
coast guard spokesman 
no bodies have been found officials said 
michael marx the ntsbs senior metallurgist said there was no 
evidence that metal fatigue weakness caused gradually by longterm 
use caused the hole in the 18yearold jet uniteds oldest boeing 
747 
marx said the holes edge indicated that overstress a 
stress greater than the plane could stand had been placed on the 
aircraft but he did not say what it might have been 
if a door opened in flight it could possibly cause 
overstress dickinson said in response to a question dickinson 
added that the condition could be caused by other factors he 
declined to explain 
its typical of an overload marx said 
the hole follows the dimensions of the cargo door and flares 
farther up the aircraft dickinson said 
the federal aviation adminstration in july ordered airlines to 
improve cargo door lock systems on older boeing 747s after a door in 
one plane partly opened in flight the deadline for the work was the 
end of 1989 
united had inspected all 25 of its jets covered by the order but 
had completed the required modifications on just six by last week 
spokesman russell mack said in chicago the plane in last weeks 
accident was not one of the six he said 
dickinson said the pilot and copilot told investigators saturday 
there was no indication of trouble closing the cargo doors 
dickinson said a warning light in the cockpit would have indicated 
if the doors were not closed properly 
the cargo door warning system worked when tested sunday but 
dickinson said he did not know whether the pilot noticed the warning 
light when the cargo door ripped off 
fbi agents searched the cargo area with dogs and found no 
evidence of explosives dickinson said fbi explosive experts were 
sent home he said sunday 
nothing yet gives us any indication of a bomb in the cargo 
area but we are not drawing any conclusions yet he said 
the missing passengers are susan craig and harry craig of 
morristown nj rose harley of hackensack nj anthony fallon 
and barbara fallon of long beach calif mary t handley of bay 
city mich lee campbell of wellington new zealand and dr john 
michael crawford and john swann both of sydney australia 
honolulu hospitals reported treating 27 people mostly for minor 
injuries caused by flying debris 
three people remained hospitalized sunday a 48yearold flight 
attendant in fair condition with broken bones in her neck and upper 
back and abdominal injuries a flight attendant in fair condition 
with a fractured arm and a 73yearold new zealand man in stable

a 12year marine corps veteran should 
be dismissed because her association with lesbians made the corps 
look bad a board of inquiry has ruled 
capt judy meades friendships with lesbian women gave the 
impression that you yourself were a lesbian and therefore 
brings discredit to yourself and the marine corps col jj 
carroll told meade on sunday 
ms meade 36 testified last week that she is not a lesbian 
the fivemember board recommended that ms meade be dismissed 
with an other than honorable discharge which would mean the 
loss of normal discharge and retirement benefits 
ms meade declined to comment but her civilian attorney vaughn 
taylor called the hearing process unfair 
a board of inquiry hearing differs from a court martial which is 
similar to a civilian trial in that five marine colonels hear the 
presentation of the government against the accused and then make a 
decision the board has a legal adviser available 
the opinion is automatically reviewed by the commanding general 
and then the board of review in washington 
we wish they had courtmartialed judy meade taylor said 
the evidence the government presented would have never been 
admitted in court it would have not been been allowed under the 
rules of evidence 
most of the allegations against meade stemmed from a february 
1988 visit she made to the home of a beaufort sc woman 
government witnesses said they had seen meade and the woman in 
bed together 
both meade and the woman testified they had never had sexual 
contact 
prosecutor capt christopher e dougherty argued the incident was 
enough to constitute conduct unbecoming an officer because some 
enlisted women also visiting the house saw the women in bed together 
the boards responsibility is not to make a moral judgment on 
capt judy meades life he said its to ask you to uphold the 
standards of the us marine corps the marine corps is a way of 
life she hasnt adopted it 
the board said ms meade had failed to report suspected lesbian 
activity and had misled her superior officers by withholding 
information that the other woman was a lesbian 
eighteen women at parris island sc the only marine boot camp 
where women go for basic training have been discharged for 
homosexual behavior and courtmartialed under charges of sodomy and 
indecent acts

in a boxy little house on a trim suburban 
street police believe mildmannered engineer richard daniel 
starrett perhaps under the influence of pornfueled fantasies 
assaulted young women while his wife was away 
he has admitted police say to kidnapping and assaulting three 
girls killing one of them and assaulting four others in georgia 
and south carolina 
police in five other states want to talk to him 
when police earlier this month searched starretts rented storage 
unit a mile from his house they found 935 pornographic books and 
magazines depicting sexual bondage horror scenes and nudity they 
also found criminology textbooks and books about serial killer ted 
bundy who preyed on attractive young women 
and police said they found about 100 videotapes some of which 
were of starretts sexual assaults 
he was to his neighbors a quiet reserved working 
businessman a family man says columbia county sheriff otis 
hensley and there were no suspicions by any fellow employees 
or not even suspicion by his family 
starrett 29 a design engineer came to authorities attention 
feb 10 when a 17yearold girl who vanished four days earlier 
from her lexington county sc home ran to a house on starretts 
street 
she told the occupants she had been imprisoned in starretts home 
for four days often in handcuffs and that she had been sexually 
assaulted 
three days later police near houston found starrett asleep 
behind the wheel of his flashy red camaro 
now hes charged with kidnapping the 17yearold a 12yearold 
and 15yearold jean taylor mccrea all of whom vanished from 
lexington county about 50 miles north of martinez on interstate 20 
the 17yearold and the 12yearold survived the youngest girl 
was returned to her home shortly after she disappeared last june 
starrett faces false imprisonment sodomy and child molestation 
charges in those cases 
miss mccrea who disappeared in december was shot to death 
police say starrett led them to her body and they plan to charge 
him with murder 
starrett also has admitted attacks on two women near atlanta one 
near columbia sc and one near charleston sc hensley said 
charges against him are pending in all three locations 
police say they still dont know why he did it why hes decided 
to talk about it or what other crimes he might have committed 
this was just one of those situations where law enforcement did 
not have the clairvoyance to know something that even his own family 
members were unaware of hensley said 
police say starrett who worked at the savannah river nuclear 
power plant just across the border in south carolina was careful to 
keep his two lives separate with his dark side hidden from his 
wife michelle the crimes apparently occurred while she was making 
regular visits to california police said 
soon after the 17yearolds escape a bizarre picture began to 
emerge 
hensley says starrett apparently chose at least some of his 
victims by going to the homes of people who had placed classified 
ads in newspapers trying to sell merchandise he abducted girls he 
found home alone police said the 17yearolds family for 
example was trying to sell a water bed 
the wantad connection is pretty much similar in all the cases 
we looked at says hensley 
within days police in north carolina california texas alabama 
and tennessee were considering starrett as a possible suspect in 
unsolved abductions or sexual assaults in their states 
one of the managers at the storage warehouse complex where 
starrett rented a unit said she was surprised by starretts arrest 
and that it seemed uncharacteristic 
he was more or less quiet he never said too much when he came 
in said paula snellings comanager of the van guard warehouse 
i never would have imagined he would do something like that 
she said he was just too straight acting he dressed neat he 
drove a pretty car

temperatures were climbing back toward the 
70s and the price of produce also was expected to go up because of 
damage from a recordbreaking cold snap 
i had a fellow with 500 acres of cucumbers and peppers in south 
hillsborough county call me this morning to tell me that theyre 
completely gone said tom burgin a produce broker in plant city 
at the wholesale level burgin said a bushel of peppers that 
cost 7 to 8 last week probably will cost him 25 to 30 and will 
come from mexico or the west 
floridas produce industry is estimated at more than 11 billion 
annually compared with the 13 billionayear citrus industry that 
appeared to have suffered only minimal damage from the cold wave 
that arrived thursday 
unseasonably warm weather earlier this winter contributed to 
losses because it induced farmers to plant early said reggie brown 
spokesman for orlandobased florida fruit and vegetable association 
from talking with several growers yesterday we did experience 
quite a bit of damage on the real coldsensitive crops cucumbers 
watermelons and squash and some damage on peppers and tomato 
crops he said sunday 
he said he expected the crop loss would be up to 30 percent of 
potential yield 
what i see is a disaster roger harloff a palmetto tomato 
grower and packer said saturday as he stood in a 1000acre tract 
of young plants about threequarters of the plants were dead and 
blackening in the bright sunlight they had been exposed to 
26degree temperatures for more than four hours that morning 
were all about in the same boat down here harloff said 
tomatoes are the states largest produce crop valued at almost 
490 million in 1987 the latest figures available 
bill butler said the damage was the worst in the 10 years hes 
worked at ruskin vegetable corp which ships fresh produce to some 
of the largest grocery store chains and terminal markets in north 
america 
our main suit is tomatoes said butler general manager of 
the hillsborough company 
the damage to the tomato crop was considerable ive seen a lot 
of kill today ive seen total loss in some fields and just a 
little bit in a few fields because they were close to the warming 
water but ive seen at least some damage in every field up to 
total destruction

byproduct of the nations easing of travel restrictions and its 
marketoriented reforms which have encouraged labor mobility

prosperous provinces is the main chinese mecca for urban 
jobseekers

a quaker group wants the town to challenge 
us defense departmentfunded anthrax research at the university of 
massachusetts maintaining it could be used in germ warfare 
we are committed to eradicating the research from the campus 
said john bonifaz who heads the effort by the local chapter of the 
american friends service committee 
anthrax is an infectious disease contracted by wild and 
domesticated animals especially cattle and sheep it is caused by a 
bacterium and can be transmitted to people 
the town health board has scheduled a public hearing thursday on 
the groups claim that the 23yearold research project poses a 
health threat not only to amherst but the nation as a whole 
because of its possible military uses said town health director 
bettye anderson frederic 
the chief scientist on the research project curtis b thorne 
has maintained his work on the basic structure of the bacterium is 
aimed at finding a vaccine for the disease 
for the past nine years his work has been financed by grants 
totaling about 1 million from the defense department under its 
biological defense research project according to james langley 
assistant vice chancellor for university relations and development 
prior to that it was funded by the national institute of health he 
said 
diana stein a member of the town health board who has questioned 
the boards involvement in the dispute said that because the 
unclassified research is being openly published it could help all 
countries find an anthrax vaccine eventually rendering useless any 
biological weapons using the bacteria 
the university which has been pressured by the quaker group to 
dump the research had not commented on the issue until late last 
week when chancellor joseph duffey strongly defended thornes work 
as a public institution we will respond to responsible 
questions or concerns but we do not intend to modify policies in 
response to threats or demands duffey said as long as the 
scope methods and results of research are fully and freely 
disseminated we will protect the right of our faculty to conduct 
research of their own choosing 
unfortunately two very distinct issues have been presented as 
one concern by the afsc duffey said the first the issue of 
public safety can be dealt with simply and straightforwardly the 
anthrax research conducted at the university poses no danger to the 
health or safety of the researcher the university or the local 
community professor thorne has conducted this research for 23 years 
without a single incident or safety violation 
duffey said the second issue of whether the university should 
conduct research supported by the defense department should be 
discussed on its own merits and not in the context of an effort to 
frighten people with unfounded allegations about threats to public 
health and without imputing false motives to the university or 
professor thorne 
he said a variety of research including some very basic 
scientific investigation is currently being funded by the defense 
department 
our policies in this area are guided by action taken by the 
faculty senate and the universitys board of trustees he said 
those policies do not prohibit members from the faculty from 
undertaking research so long as the scope methods and results can 
be fully and freely disclosed we intend to abide by and defend this 
policy

a united airlines flight 811 passenger says he 
cheated death by switching seats in the jumbo jet shortly before a 
huge chunk of the fuselage tore off in flight sweeping nine people 
to their deaths 
that really saved my life i think i ended up with the safest 
seat on the whole plane said william van rij 70 of 
christchurch new zealand 
van rij a dairy industry consultant said he usually travels 
business class and likes to sit in the upper deck 
he said he could not get an upper deck seat on the united 
airlines flight from los angeles but was told to check in early at 
honolulu international airport before fridays flight to new zealand 
to switch from the main deck 
van rij said he was given a window seat on the left side of the 
upper deck of the boeing 747400 
about 45 minutes into the flight he said we heard this loud 
bang and then it was like a huge storm the noise was really 
tremendous 
pieces of the cabin were flying around its very hard to 
describe im sure i wold have died in that other seat 
van rij said he didnt realize until the plane returned safely to 
honolulu about 15 minutes later that a huge hole had been ripped in 
the right side and that the nine people sucked out of the plane had 
been sitting in business class on the main deck 
as the plane descended toward honolulu van rij said he thought 
of the hundreds who died aboard the titanic then prayed and 
remembered the words to the hymn nearer my god to thee 
we all thought that was the finish you dont handle those 
things yourself you rely on god he said 
twentyseven others were hospitalized although all but van rij 
and two others were released by sunday 
van rij who said he underwent heart bypass surgery several years 
ago was hospitalized at the queens medical center for observation 
after suffering chest pain 
van rijs wife adrian 69 flew to honolulu on saturday he said 
their six children have been checking on him by telephone 
although he marveled at his luck another man who tried to get a 
seat on the upper deck was not so lucky van rij said 
two people claimed to have a boarding pass for the same seat and 
after an argument one went downstairs to the main deck van rij 
said 
without knowing the passengers name united airlines said it 
could not confirm his fate 
van rij said he is not afraid to fly again even though this is 
his second near miss 
in 1948 he was supposed to fly to atlantic city nj for a 
dairy products exhibition but became ill and could not travel

twentyfive years ago when dancing rather than 
complicated computerized scenery was the stuff that made musicals 
move jerome robbins was the king of broadway 
now the king has come back to reclaim his throne with jerome 
robbins broadway a dazzling retrospective of dances and other 
numbers from the musicals he helped bring to life from 1944 to 1964 
that list includes such classics as west side story gypsy 
fiddler on the roof the king and i peter pan and on 
the town 
the production which opened sunday at broadways imperial 
theater is not a revival its a brilliant distillation of the 
past reconstructed and rethought with the utmost precision and care 
by robbins and a team of assistants that includes such veteran 
broadway dancers as grover dale cynthia onrubia and jerry mitchell 
robbins and his cast of 62 dancers demonstrate why the musical 
particularly the american musical was and still can be 
exhilarating theres nothing else quite like it peter pan soaring 
over the rooftops of london the swagger and shock of the sharks and 
jets crossing switchblades tevye expounding on the importance of 
tradition or a dizzy charleston that has flappers falling to the 
floor and still continuing to dance 
all are part of jerome robbins broadway but the evening 
opens sentimentally with a trio of numbers from on the town 
robbins first show 
on the town tells the story of three sailors out on a 24hour 
spree in world war ii new york but its a story told not only 
through dialogue and song but through dance too it combines 
elements of ballet with the brash brassy and confident style of 
popular dance 
its a technique that robbins perfected more than a decade later 
in west side story for jerome robbins broadway he has put 
together a 30minute suite of dances from this leonard 
bernsteinstephen sondheim musical and it is the emotional and 
physical heart of the show 
comprised of sections from the prologue the rumble 
cool america the dance hall and somewhere the 
suite compresses the entire modernday story of romeo and juliet 
into quite simply the best choreography now on broadway and the 
dancers attack it with a ferocity that is astounding there is an 
unnerving ontheedge menace to their work when the rival sharks 
and jets square off the feeling is electric the audience gasps 
when bernardo knifes riff and the hero tony inevitably gets drawn 
into the tragedy 
the west side story suite features ensemble dancing at its 
very best but special praise must go to scott wise as the cocky 
riff nicholas garr who is a murderous bernardo and robert la fosse 
as a poignant even poetic tony 
another side to robbins also is revealed in this show the man 
can be funny not above using a pratfall a bawdy joke or just plain 
corn to get a laugh all of those elements come together in comedy 
tonight the opening number of the 1962 musical a funny thing 
happened on the way to the forum 
robbins devised it when forum was in trouble out of town the 
songs humor set the tone for the entire musical and helped make it 
a hit in new york the number gets just as many laughs now with 
jason alexander playing the zero mostel role 
alexander a pudgyfaced performer serves as narrator for 
jerome robbins broadway as well as an occasional participant in 
the proceedings whether softshoeing his way through i still get 
jealous a beguiling jule styne melody from high button shoes 
or playing tevye in fiddler on the roof alexander has all the 
right moves 
robbins has constructed the show so it starts slowly building to 
the powerful west side story segment at the end of the first 
act but the pace doesnt let up in act 2 
robbins begins the second act with the small house of uncle 
thomas the charming ballet retelling of uncle toms cabin 
from the king and i east meets west and robbins is the

from the tone of the show you would never know musical theater 
was about collaboration but he adds robbins broadway is 
inseparable from the broadway the new york i imagined growing up in 
milwaukee i want this show to run and run and run to remind me that 
the greatness i imagined back then was indeed a reality 
clive barnes in the new york post also notes that those same 
musicals were among broadways finest not solely on the basis of 
the robbins choreography and direction but he says the show 
is magnificent a musical of musicals that is all dancing all 
music and all feeling revealing robbins again as broadways once

in a reversal of his earlier remark on japans role 
in world war ii prime minister noboru takeshita said monday there 
was no denying japan was an aggressor in the conflict 
it is regrettable that my unsatisfactory remark invited 
criticism from other asian countries takeshita said during a 
parliamentary budget committee session china had been especially 
indignant 
parliament resumed business after a weeks recess for the funeral 
of emperor hirohito whose death has renewed debate and national 
soulsearching over japans role in world war ii 
takeshita said today that japan caused grave damage to 
neighboring countries through the war there is no denying our 
countrys aggressive actions during the war he said 
in a feb 18 parliamentary committee session takeshita said the 
question of whether japan was an aggressor in world war ii would 
have to be decided by future historians 
the remark touched off sharp criticism from countries that 
suffered brutal invasions by japan before and during the war 
chinas foreign minister qian qichen who attended the emperors 
funeral urged the japanese government to cease promulgating what he 
said he viewed as distortions of japans militaristic past 
qian met friday with both takeshita and foreign minister sousuke 
uno 
italian and soviet newspapers have also accused takeshita of 
evading the issue of japans wartime aggression and failing to draw 
lessons from history 
the question of war responsibility is sensitive in japan because 
of debate over the personal role of the late emperor many 
historians say the monarch was a figurehead during world war ii 
powerless against the military cabinet 
two cabinet ministers were forced to step down in 1986 and 1988 
after they said japans wartime actions were justifiable and did not 
constitute aggression

radical students yelling bush go 
home battled riot police with firebombs and rocks in at least six 
cities today to protest the presidents visit to seoul and demand 
the withdrawal of us forces 
about 700 radical students battled riot police around dongguk 
university when they were blocked from marching to the downtown us 
embassy by hundreds of riot police in green combat fatigues and 
visored helmets 
yankees go home and down with military dictatorship 
students armed with steel pipes and clubs screamed as they hurled 
showers of firebombs and rocks at lines of police blocking the 
street 
no serious injuries or arrests were reported during the 45minute 
clash 
bush in seoul for a fivehour visit on his way home from china 
and japan moved around the capital by helicopter and was nowhere 
near the violence the government had mobilized 20000 riot police 
in central seoul to block protests during his visit 
radical students protesting bushs visit clashed with police in 
at least five provincial cities including the southern city of 
kwangju where about 3000 police engaged hundreds of students in 
street battles 
riot police drove off students who tried to protest outside the 
us air force base at kunsan south of seoul and clashes were also 
reported in taegu pusan and chongju 
outside dungguk university riot police fired teargas bombs with 
rifles into groups of students or pelted them at close range with 
teargas grenades 
several officers were set on fire after being hit by firebombs 
but the flames were quickly extinguished 
students burned effigies of bush and president roh taewoo at a 
rally on the school grounds before marching out toward the us 
embassy about three miles away marchers beating drums led the 
procession 
during the rally radical leaders denounced bush and the united 
states charging that washington keeps troops in south korea to 
enforce its rule 
earlier in the day riot police broke up an attempt by dissident 
leaders to march to the us embassy to deliver a letter addressed 
to bush demanding withdrawal of the 42000 us troops based in 
south korea under a mutual defense treaty 
about 15 prominent dissidents shouting slogans and carrying 
pictures of bush with red crosses drawn through them were seized and 
hauled away after trying to assemble about a block from the embassy 
no bush visit the small band shouted before they were 
overwhelmed by charging police who kicked and punched some of the 
protesters 
dissident groups claimed 32 people were arrested today protesting 
the visit police said there had been arrests but gave no figures 
bushs helicopter passed overhead minutes after a protest on its 
way to the nearby presidential mansion the blue house where bush 
met roh 
hundreds of riot police ringed the embassy and other us 
facilites because of radicals threats to hold nationwide 
antiamerican protests 
riot police were also posted at us army bases to prevent 
attacks 
the letter to bush released earlier by the nations main 
dissident alliance denounced the united states as the main source 
of division and strife in south korea it called for withdrawal of 
all us forces from south korea and charged that washington rules 
the country like a colony 
usa is the source of all suppression and sorrow to korean 
people since the division of the korean peninsula the letter said 
the letter accused washington of dividing the korean peninsula 
and keeping troops in the south to prevent reunification with 
communist north korea 
it also denounced washington for seeking greater access for us 
imports to south korea 
the letter also said the bush visit helps roh who they want to 
oust radicals claim rohs government is a military dictatorship 
controlled by the united states 
radical students have little public support because of their 
violence and extremism but can assemble thousands of activists and 
often clash with riot police in seoul and other cities

a group of journalists and engineers are fighting 
a huge dam project on the yangtze river marking the first time 
chinese intellectuals have united for an environmental cause 
the group which is to hold its first news conference tuesday 
has published a book criticizing the three gorges hydroelectric 
project a 15000megawatt facility that would be the largest water 
power project in the world 
the book represents the first time chinese journalists have 
worked together based on their conscience not on what the 
staterun press has told them to do said dai qing editor of the 
book prepared by journalists from the peoples daily xinhua news 
agency and other leading publications 
ms dai an editor at the prestigious guangming daily said she 
organized opposition because huge industrial projects need to be 
discussed by all of society not just by a few men in a ministry 
somewhere 
she said all the journalists and engineers participating in the 
group are worried about chinas environment which has deteriorated 
rapidly during the past 10 years of swift economic growth 
her comments also come as an increasing number of chinese 
intellectuals are challenging the governments monopoly on 
decisionmaking power 
since the 1949 revolution my country has undertaken thousands 
of mistaken projects she said but you would think that in a 
planned economy things would be carried out scientifically thats 
not the case in china 
in the 1950s and 1960s she said industrial projects were pushed 
on their political merits indeed opponents of the three gorges 
project were branded as rightists in political campaigns in 
those days 
now government ministries compete for scarce resources for their 
projects paying little heed to the interests of the nation as a 
whole she said 
it may be less political but the behavior is just as harmful 
to the country she said 
ms dai said she realized she was risking her job and possibly 
her future by openly voicing her opinion 
but that doesnt bother me she said i cannot keep 
silent 
since the communist revolution chinese politicians have been 
considering a plan to build a 610foot dam on the yangtze river near 
the border of sichuan and hubei provinces in central china 
the dam would block the famous three gorges covering forever the 
vistas celebrated on chinese scroll paintings for centuries 
the project would tame the perennial floods of the mighty 
yangtze the third longest river in the world after the nile and the 
amazon it also would provide energy to nearby cities like chunking 
chinas biggest urban center with 16 million people 
factories in chunking are idle at least 20 percent of the time 
because they lack power 
in january it looked like the project would be delayed five 
years when vicepremier yao yilin said economic difficulties would 
hold up the plan but last week backers of the project held a news 
conference and said yao was only expressing his personal opinion 
the project would have to tackle massive problems 
about 1 million people will have to be moved to make room for a 
huge reservoir containing 519 trillion gallons of water according 
to a chinese scientist who has worked on the project for several 
decades 
the dam is planned for an area prone to earthquakes 
one jolt and wuhan a major industrial center east of the 
planned dam will be wiped out said the scientist who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
finally much of the land around the dam has been deforested by 
peasants seeking wood for their homes and for energy 
we fear the dam will turn the center of china into a big mud 
puddle he said the damage to the environment could be 
catastrophic 
in the face of the problems china has asked for foreign advice 
in 1980 an american team of engineers said the project was so 
dangerous it would be like putting an atomic bomb on chinas 
head according to chinese documents obtained here 
the engineers report says china should concentrate on tapping 
the sparsely populated upper reaches of the yangtze river for power 
it also raises concerns about the destruction of the three 
gorges the chinese equivalent of north americas grand canyon

roy eldridge one of the great innovators of the 
jazz trumpet who gained prominence with gene krupas band and later 
toured with benny goodman has died at age 78 
eldridge died sunday at franklin general hospital in valley 
stream no cause of death was given his wife viola died three 
weeks ago they had been married 53 years 
fellow jazz trumpeter jon faddis said eldridge was one of the 
most exciting jazz trumpeters 
one mistake that experts make is to say that he was the link 
between louis armstrong and dizzy gillespie but he was much more 
he was a giant in his own right faddis said 
a native of pittsburgh eldridge came to new york city in 1930 
and played in cecil scotts band and later with teddy hill and 
connies hot chocolates 
he gained national attention when he was the featured trumpeter 
and singer with krupas band from 1941 to 1943 becoming one of the 
first black jazz musicians to be a permanent member of the brass 
section of a white band 
after leaving krupas band he joined norman granzs jazz at the 
new york philharmonic 
when he left the artie shaw band in 1945 eldridge complained 
angrily about the many racial incidents he endured while playing 
with the band he vowed he would never play with a white band again 
although he did later 
he gained star status in europe especially france when in 1950 
he toured with goodmans sextet 
he returned to the united states in 1951 and often appeared with 
groups that featured such luminaries as ella fitzgerald johnny 
hodges and coleman hawkins 
eldridge is survived by a daughter

billy tipton kept to himself as his jazz 
trio toured the west 
he never went swimming in the motel pools waiting for a call 
from the groups manager hed say or didnt want to burn his fair 
skin he stayed in a separate room and didnt talk much about 
childhood or family life when he did talk hed say he came from a 
broken home and was sent to live with an aunt 
drummer dick oneill considered tipton to be his best friend but 
even he was shocked at what the saxophone and piano player had been 
hiding 
billy tipton was a biological female pathologist george 
lindholm said after an autopsy on tipton who died jan 21 from a 
bleeding ulcer 
interviews with family friends colleagues and jazz aficionados 
shed little light on tiptons early years even her age is 
uncertain kitty oakes who lived as tiptons wife after 1960 until 
they separated about 10 years ago told a funeral home tipton was 
born dec 29 1914 in oklahoma city and was raised in kansas city 
mo but no birth certificate has been found 
what is known is that tipton a saxophone and piano player who 
liked to write vocal arrangements performed with the jack 
teagarden russ carlyle and scott cameron bands before forming the 
billy tipton trio in the 1950s 
he gave up everything oakes who adopted three sons with 
tipton told the spokesmanreview newspaper there were certain 
rules and regulations in those days if you were going to be a 
musician 
but jazz experts including several women who played in bands in 
the 1930s said that while there was discrimination they doubted 
that a talented musician would have had to pose as a man to make it 
in the industry they point to mary lou williams and others who 
became famous as jazz musicians and composers 
when i first started i was skipped over unless they couldnt 
get anybody else said pianist norma teagarden sister of jack 
teagarden at that time it was hard to break in with a band 
especially if you played saxophone 
there was a lot of resistance there were not many women in 
that business anyway youve got to be on the road so much you 
cant very well be married unless your husband was one of the 
group 
i was a piano player and didnt have any problems joining a 
jazz band she said having three brothers who were established 
musicians probably helped said ms teagarden who performs in san 
francisco two nights a week 
marion mcpartland a jazz pianist who hosts a national public 
radio jazz show said its such a strange story i dont feel it 
any part of my own career i cant identify with somebody doing 
something like that 
there were many women jazz players around in lots of bands 
i can only say that ive been fortunate in that ive never even had 
the feeling of hopelessness she had to do a thing like that 
mcpartland said 
the bands were mostly men and i would think in the 1930s where 
they were on the road doing onenighters a lot having a woman on 
the bus had a sort of inhibiting effect on the language used 
and so on said stanley dance who has written eight books on jazz 
musicians from that point of view a lot of males would not 
welcome the woman 
still it seems a little bit extraordinary to have done that 
it certainly was unusual to find a white woman playing piano in 
jazz bands said george simon a jazz critic i dont think that 
society was really well prepared for women jazz players even 
jazz which was as liberal a society as you could find there wasnt 
that much integration 
oneill said the clamor over the role reversal overshadows the 
fact that tipton was a fine musician with a keen sense of humor 
tiptons baby face and high voice prompted some cracks in 
nightclubs but the drummer said i would almost fight anybody 
who said tipton looked too feminine to be a man 
i came from a small town and was a mill worker he had feminine 
features and at first i thought he was kind of queer but after i 
went to work for him i had no reason to think that oneill said 
he was a straight guy and there was no hankypanky 
tipton was the type of person who would give you the shirt off 
his back he made gobs of money for other people and ended up with 
nothing he said 
tipton stayed for several months in a rooming house run by the 
teagardens mother in oklahoma city ms teagarden remembers tipton 
was in her late teens and lived with an older woman even then 
tipton dressed in mens clothing 
billy was trying to get started she had a few jobs around 
town but i never heard her play said ms teagarden tipton told 
members of her trio she had learned to play piano from norma 
teagarden who also doubts that tipton played with her famous 
brother jack 
a lot of people claim those kinds of things if they did play 
with my brothers band it was usually someone drafted for one night 
to replace one of the regulars who got sick she said theres 
something very sad about it to have to live all your life like 
that under false pretenses

a smalltown lawyer ordered by federal 
courts to represent convicts says the us supreme court should let 
him off the case because he would not be able to provide competent 
courtroom representation 
i consider myself a business lawyer said john a mallard 
34 whose case was scheduled to go before the high court tuesday 
i consider myself very competent to read the law construe the 
law and argue the law but not to take on some of these courtroom 
responsibilities he said 
mallard a partner in a law firm in this southeastern iowa town 
of 9500 people was picked to represent three inmates in june 1987 
from a list of more than 100 attorneys compiled by the volunteer 
lawyers project a joint venture of the legal services corp of iowa 
and the iowa state bar association 
the inmates at the iowa state penitentiary at fort madison filed 
a civil rights lawsuit alleging that guards and officials mistreated 
them endangered their lives by revealing they were informants and 
filed false disciplinary reports against them one inmate is out on 
parole 
courts routinely assign lawyers to represent indigent defendants 
in criminal cases and the lawyers are paid at taxpayer expense 
which is generally a fraction of what they normally could receive 
in civil rights lawsuits lawyers are paid expenses and may be paid 
a part of any damages won by their clients 
mallards request to be taken off the case was denied by a us 
magistrate a federal district judge and the 8th us circuit court 
of appeals 
he contends those decisions misinterpreted an 1892 federal 
statute that says the court may request rather than order an 
attorney to represent an indigent defendant 
the iowa attorney generals office which will argue the case 
against mallard says he is shirking his obligations 
when a judge asks you to help him or her out in the 
administration of justice its your duty and obligation to say 
yes and to do your best job deputy attorney general gordon 
allen said earlier this month but in mr mallards case he 
simply didnt say that he said i dont want to play i dont want 
to come to your party 
mr mallard is not incompetent allen said hes carrying 
this all the way to the supreme court and doing an admirable job 
incompetency by itself is not a reason for exclusion of your 
responsibility 
unfortunately for the inmates their case has just done 
nothing its gone nowhere while we have litigated mr mallards 
responsibility to represent them 
the case is being closely watched by lawyers said jack londen 
chairman of the california bar associations legal services section 
were very troubled by saddling a client with a lawyer whos 
unwilling to represent the client said londen who filed a 
friendofthecourt brief on mallards behalf its not fair to 
the client 
but iowa legal services corp deputy director martin ozga who 
filed a brief to support the state attorney general said the high 
court should compel mallard to take the case 
if youre talking trial lawyers and thats all they do youre 
talking about a fairly small amount of people ozga said youd 
never be able to get enough attorneys to represent people

elk and bison in fire 
ravaged yellowstone would be better helped by longterm solutions 
rather than by donations of hay says the national park service 
director 
a severe winter and loss of natural foods because of last 
summers drought and huge fires have driven hundreds of elk and 
bison over the park boundary into southern montana 
in the small montana town of gardiner north of the park 
starving elk are eating ornamental hedges trees and hay donated by 
sympathetic people small herds of elk and buffalo have congregated 
in town 
they are skinny and weak said trudi taylor who helped raise 
money to feed the animals after one elk died in her yard she said 
she hopes to save younger cows that will soon calve 
in this town most of the people make their money off these 
animals at least they could give a little back she said 
referring to the areas popularity with hunters and tourists 
but feeding hay to elk is expensive and can spread disease when 
elk gather at feeding stations park service director william penn 
mott told a news conference at park headquarters 
once rangers start providing hay to elk in yellowstone the 
expensive practice could continue indefinitely like at the national 
elk refuge in jackson said mott who was sent on a factfinding 
trip saturday by new interior secretary manuel lujan jr 
almost 500 of yellowstones 2700 bison have been shot in montana 
in a statesanctioned hunt and 250 additional permits have been 
issued more than 2350 elk from yellowstones northern herd of 
19000 were shot by montana hunters this winter inside yellowstone 
rangers have counted more than 300 elk carcasses 
mott said one option he could support was to have the federal 
government acquire more winter game range in montana north of the 
park the rocky mountain elk foundation of missoula mont 
announced friday that it will start a special fund toward expanding 
winter range for yellowstones northern elk herd 
mott also said he will ask the park service other federal and 
state agencies and conservation groups to help draft a report to 
look at yellowstones total wildlife management program which he 
called fragmented 
this is needed so that everybody knows what is going to be done 
for longterm management of yellowstone park and preservation of the 
area he said 
mott said he hoped a wildlife report would be completed within 
six months 
we will look at the total ecosystem and how to best manage 
wildlife if land is being overgrazed we should look at this 
mott repeated his support for reintroduction of wolves into 
yellowstone saying they could help keep biggame populations in 
balance and are part of the wests biological diversity 
elk and bison populations in yellowstone are near alltime highs 
because of recent mild winters 
the biggame herds are in no danger of extinction but in some 
areas visitors may see fewer animals this year he said 
even if winter kill of northern herd elk is 50 percent there 
would still be a core that would rapidly reproduce he said 
mary meagher a yellowstone biologist said bison have the 
biological capacity of recovering from low numbers she recalled 
that the parks hundreds of bison started with a remnant population 
of 22 animals 
montana officials authorized a bison hunt because about half of 
yellowstones bison carry the disease brucellosis which some 
scientists say could be transmitted to cattle 
but meagher said her best information from the montana state 
veterinarian was that no cases of brucellosis in that state had been 
traced to yellowstone park animals she pointed out that ranchers 
vaccinate their calves against the disease 
last year only 39 bison were shot in montanas hunt and this 
years hunt has been denounced as a slaughter by activists such as 
cleveland amory president of the fund for animals

medicare reform and other health programs are 
suffering because the new bush administration still has many 
vacancies in key government jobs executives of the american medical 
association charged 
almost four months after the elections we are still wondering 
who will be named to the post of presidential science adviser dr 
james h sammons said sunday in a speech closing the amas 1989 
national leadership conference 
theres nobody in charge at the department of health and human 
services sammons the associations executive vice president 
added later and we dont have an assistant secretary of defense 
for health at the pentagon 
the lack of people in top health positions delays progress on 
health programs and puts the executive branch at a disadvantage in 
dealing with congress on upcoming legislation said dr james c 
todd the amas deputy vice president 
we are terribly concerned about it he said 
the senate on tuesday is likely to confirm dr louis sullivan for 
the cabinet post at the health department the largest federal 
agency the 114000employee department administers a third of 
federal spending 
sullivans confirmation hearing before the senate finance 
committee was delayed for three weeks because an fbi background 
investigation was incomplete and there were questions about his 
finances 
president bush acknowledged last week that many positions remain 
unfilled in federal agencies but he said hes not concerned about 
the vacancies because the employees remaining from the reagan 
administration share bushs goals 
sammons said the delay on appointments is just one problem and 
that the administration and congress have shown neglect on 
health issues since the election 
during the campaign for a kinder and gentler america 
presidentelect bush and just about every congressman and senator 
you can name talked about taking care of the elderly and the 
needy sammons said today while 37 million americans have no 
health insurance at all and another 17 million have only partial 
coverage the only thing i hear coming out of washington is taking 
5 billion more out of the medicare budget 
bush proposed a 5 billion cut to medicare when he announced his 
revisions of president reagans 1990 budget proposal which already 
called for reducing spending on the program 
sammons called on participants in the conference to influence 
government policy to help americans with inadequate health insurance 
and to ensure longterm care for the elderly

federal investigators focused on a jumbo jets 
cargo door locks as the cause of an accident that killed nine 
passengers and united airlines inspected the baggage compartment 
hatches of all its boeing 747s 
the coast guard meanwhile ended a sea and air search of the 
pacific 100 miles southwest of honolulu after recovering 57 pieces 
of debris from the united flight 
flight 811 took off friday for new zealand with 354 people and 
was about 100 miles from honolulu when the fuselage ripped open as 
the plane flew at 22000 feet nine passengers were sucked out of 
the 18yearold jetliner and are presumed dead 
the pilot capt david m cronin lost power in one of the four 
engines and shut down another when a fire indicator light went on 
but the plane returned safely to honolulu international airport 
among the items recovered were seat cushions an overhead 
compartment a section of fuselage safety instruction cards and 
personal items including baby shoes and a teddy bear authorities 
said 
neither human remains nor the cargo door was recovered sunday 
said lee dickinson a national transportation safety board 
investigator 
obviously if we had the door it would be very helpful to us 
he said sunday night but added that other information could 
pinpoint the cause 
we are focusing on and looking at the latching mechanism 
said dickinson were also trying to get a better handle on these 
latch pin supports and comparing them to others 
investigators have determined that the right forward cargo bay 
door had been closed electronically with eight latching mechanisms 
along the bottom attached to the planes frame as well as a 
latching mechanism and a hook pin on each side said dickinson 
a warning system that would have alerted the cockpit if the door 
were not closed properly worked during a test sunday dickinson 
said he said he did not know if a warning light went off when the 
cargo door tore off the plane 
dickinson said there was no evidence that metal fatigue 
weakness caused gradually by longterm use or sabotage had caused 
the accident and that fbi explosives experts had been sent home 
in washington us transportation secretary samuel skinner 
agreed today that sabotage or a bomb was not a cause 
it appears now from all the evidence that there was no 
explosion of any type he said on abcs good morning america 
and so i think we can pretty well rule that out 
but he cautioned that the investigators were still working the 
preliminary indications of course are that the door opened or at 
least the skins peeled around the door 
but lets wait till the board reports he said then well 
know finally what went on premature speculation is very dangerous 
uniteds special checks of the latches seals fittings and other 
parts of the door mechanisms of its 30 other boeing 747s were to be 
completed by early today said airline spokesman rob doughty 
nobody told us we had to do this he said its a 
precautionary decision based on the area that was impacted in this 
incident 
besides the new inspections united president stephen wolf said 
mechanics licensed by the federal aviation administration would 
inspect each 747 cargo door upon arrival and would oversee the 
closing of each 747 cargo door before takeoff the closings have 
been handled by ramp personnel his statement said 
wolf said the 747 involved in the accident was in compliance with 
all faa airworthiness directives and maintenance requirements 
pertaining to cargo doors and that the door worked properly before 
the accident 
however the cargo door locks had not yet been modified under a 
july order that was issued by the faa after a door in one 747 partly 
opened in flight 
the deadline for that work is the end of this year doughty said 
he did not know whether united would now rush the modifications 
united had inspected all 25 of its older 747s covered by the 
order but had completed the required reinforcements on just six by 
last week said doughty 
three of the 27 people injured remained hospitalized two were 
listed in fair condition including the most seriously injured a 
48yearold flight attendant who suffered broken bones in her neck 
and upper back and abdominal injuries 
passenger william van rij 70 of new zealand remained under 
observation in stable condition because of a heart condition 
van rij said his life was spared because a changed seating 
assignment moved him from the area of the plane where the seats were 
sucked out 
that really saved my life he said i think i ended up with 
the safest seat on the whole plane

some 250 spectators cheered as a space 
shuttle main engine roared to life and sent smoke across the 
marshall space flight center during a successful 45second test 
firing 
anything that goes the full duration looks and sounds like a 
good test to me center director jr thompson said after 
saturdays test at the northern alabama base 
thompson said the benefits of the test firings should be seen by 
the mid1990s when nasa plans to begin sending pieces of its space 
station into orbit aboard the space shuttle 
nasa engineers fired the engine as part of a series of tests to 
make the main engines for the space shuttle more effective 
john mccarty head of the propulsion laboratory at marshall said 
the tests will help reduce internal engine stress making the 
shuttles main engines last longer 
were validating changes in the engine the first real ones 
since it was designed in 1972 mccarty said 
saturdays 45second test firing will be followed in three to 
four weeks by a longer 100second firing

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze said today his visit to tehran signals expanded ties 
with iran whose revolutionary leader says he wants moscow to help 
combat the devilish west 
in our opinion iran enjoys high international prestige 
irans official news agency quoted shevardnadze as saying we have 
come to the conclusion that it is a must to acknowledge others 
beliefs and respect them 
shevardnadze made his remarks at a meeting with president ali 
khamenei on sunday he met with irans revolutionary leader 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini for 90 minutes 
the islamic republic news agency said shevardnadze was quoted as 
saying his visit held the promise of closer ties between iran and 
the soviets despite ideological differences irna did not quote 
shevardnadze as enumerating the differences but iran an islamic 
republic previously has criticized the soviet unions official 
atheism 
shevardnadze was quoted as saying the two sides agreed that 
military confrontations must be reduced and chemical weapons 
annihilated worldwide according to irna he also said moscow would 
push for progress in the iraniraq peace talks stalled since the 
aug 20 ceasefire in the persian gulf war 
khamenei told shevardnadze iraq must be pressured and we 
think your government can exert this pressure more than anyone 
else irna said the soviet union was iraqs major weapons 
supplier during the war and is believed to be one of its biggest 
creditors 
irna said shevardnadze repeated his call for the withdrawal of 
foreign forces from the gulf saying we have explicitly announced 
to the american president that we condemn the us military presence 
in the persian gulf and will continue this policy until the 
americans withdraw their troops from the region 
the united states has 23 warships in and around the gulf the 
biggest fleet in the strategic waterway where the soviet union keeps 
seven to nine ships the soviet envoy has said moscow is willing to 
withdraw its ships 
on sunday parliamentiary deputies moved to put severing ties 
with britain to a floor vote on tuesday 
last week britain recalled its diplomats from tehran to protest 
khomeinis death decree for british author salman rushdie irna said 
editorials in tehran newspapers today supported breaking ties 
it said shevardnadze did not ask khomeini to withdraw his order 
for moslem zealots to assassinate rushdie whose novel the satanic 
verses is considered blasphemous by many moslems 
britain reportedly had asked shevardnadze to press khomeini to 
reprieve rushdie but irna said there was no mention of the 
rushdie affair in shevardnadzes speech 
shevardnadze the highest ranking soviet official to visit iran 
since the 1979 islamic revolution met khomeini two days after the 
iranian spiritual leader declared iran does not need relations with 
the west 
khomeini has been widely condemned in the west for issuing the 
death decree 
at their meeting khomeini stressed to shevardnadze the 
importance of the expansion of strong ties in various dimensions 
in confronting the devilish acts of the west tehran radio 
reported 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia broadcast a recording of 
excerpts from the dialogue and tehran television showed khomeini 
wearing a skullcap and robes with a blanket over his knees talking 
to shevardnadze 
afterward shevardnadze met prime minister hussein musavi and 
delivered an invitation for him to visit moscow according to irna 
tehran radio said the two agreed to set up mechanisms for 
regulating political contacts between moscow and tehran 
rushdie who was born into a moslem family in india has been in 
hiding since khomeini issued his execution order feb 14 iranian 
clerics have put a bounty of 52 million on his head 
all 12 european common market countries as well as norway sweden 
and canada have recalled their top diplomats from iran to protest 
the death decree 
shevardnadze was to return to moscow today after his 10day

police identified the victim as mohammad shafi 65 and said the 
explosion destroyed the buildings guard room 
asked whether the blast was connected to the furor over rushdies 
novel one officer said it appears that way he spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
in london a senior viking penguin editor attending an emergency 
meeting of the writers guild of great britain said hardback copies 
of the novel were selling so well that a paperback edition due out 
in august might be delayed for crude commercial reasons 
but the editor denied reports that viking penguin was considering 
canceling the paperback edition to appease moslems who consider the 
book blasphemous 
we are continuing to make the book available he was quoted 
as telling the guardian a london newspaper its simply not 
possible to keep up with demand 
if there is a way to keep the book in print and prevent further 
loss of life and if the way to do that is print some form of 
apology then maybe we should do that he was quoted as saying he 
asked not to be identified because of the death threats 
viking penguin refused to comment today on its plans for the book

relations with britain because of the furor over the satanic 
verses 
the nations official islamic republic news agency reported today 
that newspapers believed such a move would be a practical step 
and would reflect khomeinis position that relations with the west 
are unnecessary 
moslems say the book insults islam by portraying the wives of the 
prophet mohammed as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the koran 
the moslem holy book rather than receiving it from allah 
the book has been banned in iran bangladesh malaysia jordan 
egypt south africa india pakistan and brunei

fire touched off by a train derailment spread 
to another railroad tanker car early today forcing thousands of 
people to keep out of their homes and schools authorities said 
only one of the four cars of highly flammable butane that caught 
fire sunday night was burning shortly before dawn but then fire 
started at another car said lt richard summerlot of the akron fire 
department firefighters stood by waiting for the fire to go out 
the burning cars were among 17 that derailed from a csx 
transportation train on the grounds of the bf goodrich chemical 
plant fire chief george romanoski said 
i was watching tv and i heard something and saw the whole sky 
light up said minnie herrington 40 who was brought to a shelter 
with her four children ages 4 to 11 
it sounded like a gunshot 
thirteen people were treated at akron general hospital most 
suffering from inhalation of smoke and fumes one man was admitted 
in fair condition 
about 1500 homes within a half mile of sunday evenings accident 
were evacuated police said they estimated the number of evacuees 
at 2000 
shelters were set up at kenmore high school and the university of 
akron for those who could not stay with friends or relatives 
schools in this city of 250000 were closed and metropolitan bus 
service was canceled today because the city bus garage is near the 
derailment site summerlot said businesses in the area also were 
closed today he said 
the 45car train was en route from willard to akron and back to 
willard when the derailment occurred csx spokesman lloyd lewis said 
the cause was under investigation 
nine cars carried highly flammable butane lewis said the eight 
other cars that derailed carried nonhazardous materials such as 
vegetable oil clay and sand he said 
another car on the train contained butadiene which may produce 
hazardous smoke when burned but it was too far from the burning 
cars mayor don plusquellic said 
there was some concern however that the fire could spread to 
the goodrich plant which also housed butadiene he said 
butane is nontoxic when burned and is used as a fuel and an 
aerosol propellant butadiene is a petroleum derivative used to make 
synthetic rubbers and resins 
the area was evacuated because of the danger of explosion in 
the surrounding tank cars said romanoski 
he said evacuees would not be allowed to return to home until the 
fire was extinguished 
more than 80 people were evacuated to the university of akron 
which would be closed at least until noon said spokesman phil 
zimmer 
about 550 people were taken to kenmore but many had left the 
school to stay with relatives or friends about 300 people remained 
at midnight 
the mood of the evacuees ran from resignation to almost 
festive said brian williams assistant school superintendent 
children were given access to the cafeteria and the gymnasium where 
several were playing basketball 
the kids are all in a good mood williams said weve had 
people bring their rabbits guinea pigs and dogs ive been in this 
business 25 years a woman comes up to me with a dirty diaper and 
says where do i put this ive never been asked that before

tomb of emperor hirohito to pray today the first day the imperial 
cemetery was opened to the public since his burial 
under blue skies and against a backdrop of pine and cedar trees 
about 7000 people visited the cemetery bowing their heads and 
clapping twice before hirohitos tomb in the traditional gestures of 
worship at shrines of japans shinto religion 
hirohito died of cancer on jan 7 at age 87 posthumously known 
as emperor showa he was commemorated friday in a state funeral in 
tokyo attended by representatives of 164 countries including 
president bush later the same day he was entombed in the musashi 
imperial cemetery a wooded enclave in these foothills about 30

part in the entombment ceremony deeply steeped in ancient shinto 
rites and carried out to the strains of classical court music from 
wind instruments and gongs

described by guards as rightists loyal to the emperor were the 
first to enter the site of hirohitos tomb with their heads bowed

style of world war ii kamikaze pilots who flew suicide missions in 
the name of the emperor 
another mourner 63yearold masae yamamoto said he came from 
tokyo with mixed feelings 
i spent the last two years of the past war at the front and 
i have some reservations about the emperors responsibility for 
the war

he said were going to rob him on a new york city subway today lost 
a supreme court challenge to his conviction for illegally possessing 
a gun 
the court without comment rejected arguments that goetz was 
denied a fair trial 
goetz who was sentenced to a year in jail and fined 5000 
began serving his term at the rikers island prison in new york city 
last month he is eligible for but not assured of parole after 51 
days 
his case won worldwide attention prompting debates on 
selfdefense and racism some called goetz a 41yearold 
electronics engineer a hero others called him a coldhearted 
vigilante and racist 
goetz is white the four teenagers he shot are black 
the subway shooting occurred dec 22 1984 after one of the 
youths approached goetz and asked him for 5 goetz later said he 
feared he was going to be mugged and robbed 
goetz fled from the subway car and left new york city nine days 
later he surrendered to police in concord nh 
after a 1987 trial goetz was acquitted of attempted murder 
assault and other charges he was convicted only on the 
gunpossession charge 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for goetz argued that he 
was denied a fair trial by the judges instructions to jurors 
the appeal said the judge violated goetzs rights by telling 
jurors they must rather than may convict him if they 
found that all elements of the illegal possession charge had been 
proved beyond a reasonable doubt 
the jurors also were told they must acquit goetz if they 
found that the proof was insufficient to sustain any element of the 
illegal possession charge 
after his trial jurors told reporters that goetz was justified 
in shooting the men he thought were going to attack him but they 
said they had no choice but to find him guilty of illegally 
possessing a gun 
lawyers for goetz told the justices the jury by such 
compulsive language was even potentially precluded from considering 
all factors beyond the mere statutory elements toward its 
determination of goetzs ultimate guilt 
the appeal noted that goetz had been mugged several times 
previously and that he had unsuccessfully sought a permit to carry 
a gun 
prosecutors urged the justices to reject the appeal there is 
not now and never has been the slightest conflict of opinion 
among federal and state appeals courts about the constitutionality 
of the kind of instruction delivered to goetzs jury they said 
goetzs initial sentence was overturned by a state appeals court 
and he was resentenced last jan 13 
the case is goetz vs new york 881122

the supreme court today refused to let 
brunswick ga collect a 324000 reimbursement it won and then 
lost from the federal government for legal costs incurred in a 
fight over flood control 
the justices without comment let stand a federal appeals court 
ruling that the coastal city does not qualify for the reimbursement 
the dispute dates back to brunswicks request in the early 1980s 
to participate in the federally subsidized national flood insurance 
program for communities that carefully control development of land 
likely to be flooded 
in 1985 brunswick sued the federal emergency management agency 
which runs the program and others over alleged errors in 
calculating brunswicks eligibility 
the lawsuit ended in a settlement prior to any trial and a 
federal trial judge ordered the government to pay brunswick 324000 
for lawyer fees and other costs the city had incurred 
the award was made under the equal access to justice act under 
that law a local government that engages the federal government in 
legal battle is eligible for reimbursement if its net worth is less 
than 7 million and the federal governments position in the dispute 
was not substantially justified 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals last july 11 threw out the 
324000 award on two grounds it said brunswicks net worth exceeds 
7 million and the federal governments position in the flood 
control dispute was substantially justified 
on the networth issue justice department lawyers relied on the 
citys annual financial report showing total municipal equity to 
be just over 22 million when the lawsuit was filed they said that 
figure reflected the citys net worth 
but city lawyers said the net worth term used in the equal 
access to justice act should not include those assets generally not 
available to pay off debts 
the citys water and sewer system wrongly was counted as an asset 
because its worth is not available for debt payment the citys 
lawyers argued 
the 11th circuit court said net worth is determined by 
subtracting total liabilities from total assets including 
the citys water and sewer system 
the appeals court also ruled that us district judge anthony 
alaimo abused his discretion in deciding that the federal 
governments legal position in the underlying dispute had not been 
substantially justified 
the case is brunswick vs us 88948

the supreme court today rejected reverse 
discrimination arguments by a white vallejo calif firefighter 
denied a promotion that went to a black man with a slightly lower 
test score 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that upheld the 
black mans promotion to help achieve better racial balance within 
the city fire department 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled that the promotion 
was lawful 
vallejos plan concerning the promotion of qualified minority 
employees is a minimally intrusive means to achieve racial balance 
and is thus a narrowly tailored remedy for past discrimination 
the appeals court said 
the citys plan provides for consideration of race only insofar 
as the merit principle can be preserved making it a moderate and 
gradual remedy the 9th circuit court added 
the city in 1983 denied a promotion to the job of 
firefighterengineer to patrick higgins who is white the job 
instead went to errol cooley who is black 
higgins achieved the top score 9417 on a competitive 
examination for the job cooleys score was 9309 both men were 
beginninglevel firefighters in vallejo 
city officials stressed the need for better racial balance in the 
department vallejo has a minority population of 40 percent 
including 1875 percent black 
only three of the citys 80 firefighters 38 percent were black 
when cooley was promoted 
the 9th circuit court in upholding the promotion relied heavily 
on a 1987 supreme court ruling that upheld the promotion of a woman 
who scored slightly lower than a male candidate for a county 
transportation job in california 
the appeals court said cooleys promotion satisfies even the 
most rigorous equal protection requirements of the constitution 
the case is higgins vs vallejo 871283

egypts foreign minister today praised israel 
for surrendering a disputed border enclave to egypt saying he hopes 
the action can help advance efforts in the middle east 
esmat abdelmeguid spoke to reporters 12 hours after egyptian 
israeli and american officials signed accords to end by midmarch 
israels 22year occupation of taba a 250acre beach resort on the 
northern tip of the red sea 
egypts resumption of sovereignty over taba is a victory for 
peace and supports the possibilities of the peace process 
abdelmeguid said it is proof that if serious determination and 
good will are available disputes can be resolved by peaceful ways 
one agreement signed at tabas sonesta hotel stipulates that the 
egyptians pay the hotels israeli owner 37 million another set a 
price of 115 million for a nearby holiday village of beach cabanas 
and a cafeteria 
the agreements give all tourists including israelis 14 days 
access without visas from israel to taba and southern sinai 
they also put the border between egypt and israel back to its 
position prior to the 1967 middle east war when the jewish state 
occupied the sinai peninsula 
taba became an irritant in egyptianisraeli relations in 1982 
when israel withdrew from the sinai under the usbrokered camp 
david agreement but refused to give up the tiny patch of beach 
after years of fruitless negotiation the two former middle east 
foes decided in 1986 to let international arbitrators decide tabas 
fate 
on sept 29 the arbitration committee ruled that taba be 
returned to egypt but left open the fate of the beachfront except 
for the tourist facilities the enclave includes virtually nothing 
but barren rock and sand hills 
after obtaining easy access for its tourists israel finally 
signed sundays series of agreements that will put taba back in 
egyptian hands by noon march 15 
the united states signed the agreement because it helped 
negotiate the pact 
egypt hopes that completion of the israeli withdrawal becomes 
the start of a new stage during which we can expand the peace 
process in the area abdelmeguid said 
at the 40minute signing ceremony egyptian israeli and american 
delegates expressed similar hopes that future disputes between 
israel and its arab neighbors be solved through negotiations 
egyptian tourism minister fuad sultan who signed parts of the 
agreement package for egypt said his government plans further 
tourist development of tabas bay bordered by sandy beachs dotted 
by palm trees 
in the past most occupants of the hotel built in the early 
1980s have been israelis but egyptian officials have said they 
plan campaigns to lure egyptian tourists as well 
because of the sensitivity of what it considered egyptian land 
under foreign occupation the government made taba offlimits to 
egyptians during much of the sevenyear squabble over the area

fang lizhi the dissident chinese police prevented 
from attending a banquet given by president bush said today the 
presidents statement of regret was a beginning but he hoped for 
more 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush learned 
today that fang and his wife were barred the banquet sunday night 
and that he expressed regret to vice premier wu xueqian before 
flying to seoul south korea 
fitzwater said it is the presidents view that such problems as 
human rights should be dealt with in a lowkey and private manner 
the 53yearold fang chinas most famous dissident is also an 
internationally respected astrophysicist he maintains that marxism 
is a failure in china and that a multiparty system is needed to 
guarantee basic human rights 
the us embassy said ambassador winston lord met today with 
foreign ministry officials to discuss the incident details of the 
meeting were not immediately available 
fang and his wife li shuxian were traveling with an american 
couple to the banquet when police stopped their car a few blocks 
from the hotel where the banquet was held and accused the driver of 
speeding police prevented them from walking to the hotel then 
halted a taxi to which they had transferred and ordered a bus not to 
pick them up 
they insisted fang and li were not on the guest list although 
the official us list bore their names police then tailed the four 
for 90 minutes as they walked to lords residence to seek help 
fang told about two dozen reporters jammed into his tiny 
apartment today that he was a little bit afraid sunday night 
because of the many police 
but he added i cant change my views because of fear we need 
freedom and human rights 
i was very angry said his wife im not particularly 
afraid it was crazy stupid 
bush did not raise human rights issues during his two days of 
meetings with chinese leaders however senior leader deng xiaoping 
and communist party general secretary zhao ziyang both stressed that 
domestic stability is more important now than democratic reform 
zhao warned in unusually strong language that any american support 
for chinas dissidents would harm the bilateral relationship 
fang was careful not to criticize bush saying its too early 
for me to evaluate him 
but he said i hope they the americans say something more in 
the next few days 
regarding the united states i have a principled criticism i 
want it to adopt a single standard toward human rights and not a 
double standard he said i think there are indeed some double 
standards in the united states open criticism of the soviet 
unions human rights record but not chinas 
but he added of course we chinese must win our own human 
rights for ourselves 
fang who is popular among chinese students said he did not want 
the police action against him to trigger student demonstrations but 
he said he also does not expect the police action to silence 
government critics 
i have received many phone calls from friends they assured me 
they support me and they were very angry with the government fang 
said one friend said a couple of days ago that we should be 
quiet not speak so much today he called and said we should speak 
more 
several other government critics attended the bush banquet 
without interference but none is as wellknown outside china as 
fang who stepped into the political limelight in 1986 with eloquent 
speeches to college students calling for democracy and human rights 
authorities blamed him for a nationwide wave of student 
demonstrations in the winter of 198687 and expelled him from the 
ruling communist party recently they refused him permission to go 
to the united states to attend a scientific conference and teach 
fang recently sent an open letter to senior leader deng calling 
for an amnesty for political prisoners and the call was taken up by 
several dozen other leading writers and thinkers who sent a second 
letter

with the mayoral primary in its final day a poll 
showed mayor eugene sawyer narrowing the gap against richard m 
daley who hopes to win the job his father held for two decades 
the poll taken wednesday through friday for wbbmtv and the 
daily southtown economist showed daleys lead over sawyer had 
narrowed to 7 percentage points 4740 percent 
a substantial 11 percent of the 885 registered voters polled were 
undecided and the polls margin of error was 4 points 
two weeks earlier the same poll showed daley held a 10 point 
lead 43 to 33 percent 
the mayor is poised in a very good position now to overtake 
daley said sawyers campaign spokesman larry horist this race 
is virtually tied up 
daley had no immediate comment about the poll 
whether its too late for sawyer to avoid becoming the first 
black mayor of a major city to be defeated by a white remains the 
question 
with the democratic primary set for tuesday both candidates 
campaigned vigorously during the weekend each invoking the name of 
the late mayor harold washington the citys first black mayor and 
citing the need to heal the citys racial divisions 
harold washington was a strong mayor who loved the city 
daley the cook county states attorney told an allblack 
congregation one of three he visited sunday 
my father was a strong mayor who loved the city added daley 
the son of the late richard j daley who was chicagos mayor for 21 
years 
sawyer campaigned at 10 black churches at the antioch baptist 
church the mayor received a standing ovation for his solo rendition 
of the hymn how great thou art 
jesse jackson campaigned with sawyer leading supporters in 
chants of maintain the gains saying he wants to keep the 
multiracial city government that sawyer has helped build 
sawyer has gained steadily in polls during recent months while 
daley despite his lead remains below 50 percent 
the latest southtown economistwbbm poll indicated that the 
electorate remained divided along racial lines 
sawyer received the support of 73 percent of registered black 
voters surveyed to daleys 8 percent whites split 7914 percent for 
daley hispanics favored daley by 21 
the poll also found that 80 percent of blacks questioned said 
they definitely will vote tuesday versus 73 percent of whites 
chicagos population is about 40 percent black 40 percent white 
and nearly 20 percent hispanic 
whoever wins the primary faces the republican challenger and the 
thirdparty candidacy of black alderman timothy evans in april 4s 
general election 
however the democratic race turns out the gop candidate in april 
will be white and could be former democratic power edward 
vrdolyak who has launched an 11thhour republican primary writein 
campaign 
vrdolyak who joined the republican ranks after losing to 
washington in 1987 is challenging the officially endorsed gop 
candidate dr herbert sohn a physician and lawyer 
if sawyer wins the democratic primary the black vote could split 
between sawyer and evans in the general election bringing a white 
back into the mayors office 
if daley and vrdolyak win evans would gain from the split in the 
white vote 
the winner will fill out the remaining two years in washingtons 
term 
the era of bigcity black mayors in the united states began in 
1967 when carl stokes was elected in cleveland cleveland now has a 
white mayor but that happened after stokes decided not to seek 
reelection 
amongthe nations very largest cities no black incumbent has 
ever lost to a white but in charlotte nc the nations 44th 
largest city incumbent mayor harvey gantt a black lost to a white 
challeger in 1987

a civil rights lawyer who says the government 
violated his rights by eavesdropping on his conversations with 
clients lost a supreme court appeal today 
the court without comment refused to revive arthur kinoys 
lawsuit for monetary damages 
kinoys suit stems from fbi wiretapping from 1949 through 1970 of 
various people he represented his clients have included julius and 
ethel rosenberg executed for giving atomic bomb secrets to the 
soviet union and members of the socalled chicago seven who were 
accused of conspiring to incite a riot at the democratic national 
convention in 1968 
government officials said the wiretaps installed without court 
warrants were designed to protect national security the government 
said the eavesdropping was not aimed at kinoy who teaches law at 
rutgers university in new brunswick nj 
kinoys suit was filed in 1970 and eight years of pretrial 
maneuvering ensued the case was dormant from 1979 until 1985 when 
kinoy sought to revive it claiming the government violated the 
confidentiality of the lawyerclient relationship 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals last july threw out the 
suit 
kinoy as an attorney possessed no constitutional right 
independent of his clients rights to communicate with his clients 
without government intrusion when national security interests were 
at stake the appeals court said 
the appeals court noted that kinoy previously won a court order 
barring the government from any future surveillance that would 
violate his privacy rights 
but the 2nd circuit court said there is no ground for kinoy to 
collect damages from the government or from fbi officials who 
authorized or conducted the eavesdropping 
the case is kinoy vs tolson 88892

the supreme court today let stand a ruling that 
someone who plans a bank robbery but is arrested before actually 
moving toward the bank may not be convicted of violating a federal 
law prohibiting attempted bank robbery 
the court over two dissenting votes rejected a justice 
department appeal that sought reinstatement of an attempted bank 
robbery conviction in a california case 
justices byron r white and harry a blackmun voted to hear 
arguments in the case but four votes are needed to grant such review 
the case stems from the arrest of reginald dean still on aug 7 
1985 in roseville calif 
responding to a tip from a passerby police found still sitting 
in a van parked some 200 feet from the security pacific bank 
the vans motor was running when police arrived and still put it 
in reverse and drove off police caught up with him and arrested him 
police said he told them you did a good job you caught me 
five minutes before i was going to rob a bank 
he said he confessed because of incriminating evidence inside the 
van including a blond wig a phony bomb and a note demanding money 
that still said he intended to present to a teller at a driveup 
window 
police said still told them his confession was merely frosting 
on the cake because of the other evidence 
he was convicted in federal court of attempted bank robbery and 
interstate transporation of a stolen vehicle the van he said he 
intended to use in the robbery still was sentenced to 15 years in 
prison 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals upheld the stolen van 
conviction but threw out the conviction for attempted bank robbery 
stills intent to rob the security pacific national bank was 
clearly established the appeals court said 
but the facts do not establish either actual movement toward 
the bank or actions that are analytically similar to such 
movement the appeals court said without that there can be no 
conviction for attempted bank robbery it added 
justice department lawyers said the appeals court ruling 
establishes a dangerous precedent 
attempts are punished as a crime because of the great need to 
stop offenses from occurring department lawyers said 
a robbery may be only moments away even though the robber has 
not yet begun to assault the bank they continued society 
should be free to intervene in order not only to stop a crime from 
coming to pass but also to punish the defendant for putting 
innocent parties at risk of the loss of their property serious 
injury or death 
the governments appeal said the 9th circuit court ruling which 
is binding law in arizona alaska california hawaii idaho 
montana nevada oregon and washington state is in conflict with 
other federal courts 
fbi statistics show that in 1987 nearly half of all robberies of 
federally insured financial institutions occurred in states within 
the 9th circuit the government said 
the case is us vs still 88581

former democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis told new housing and urban development secretary jack kemp 
today there is a yawning gap between his optimistic talk about 
solving urban problems and president bushs federal budget proposal 
dukakis the governor of massachusetts injected a reminder of 
the 1988 presidential campaign with his remarks to kemp during the 
annual winter meeting of the national governors association 
the hud secretary who himself sought the republican presidential 
nomination last year described his hopes for using tax incentives 
and private enterprise to reinvigorate cities to a committee of the 
association 
when kemp took questions from the governors dukakis said i 
applaud kemps efforts and noted many of his proposals have 
already been put to work by states and cities 
but dukakis then asked him to reconcile his enthusiastic talk 
about solving problems of poverty homelessness and housing with 
bushs budget which would provide no new spending for subsidized 
housing and would cut some federal money to states and cities 
on the other hand as i look over the presidents budget there 
is a yawning gap between what youre saying and whats in there 
dukakis said 
he pointed to bushs proposal to further cut back the community 
development block grant program which dukakis said governments use 
as public capital to attract additional private investment in 
housing and other development projects 
the budget does need some reworking dukakis said 
kemp responded i think the president despite criticism to the 
contrary has evidenced a good faith effort to work with the 
congress he said its obligatory upon the congress to work in 
cooperation with the president on the budget 
kemp cited the restraints on the federal budget but pledged i 
can assure you that i am going to do everything i can to make sure 
that there is adequate funding for those programs that work 
bushs budget director richard darman declined an invitation to 
meet with the governors but they heard a frank assessment sunday 
from the chairman of the senate budget committee sen james sasser 
who warned were fresh out of cash here in washington 
an associated press survey of governors before their arrival 
found that most state executives respect bushs no new taxes 
pledge and are holding off on calls for raising revenue to reduce 
the federal deficit 
governors in both parties said that bushs promise of a kinder 
gentler america suggested his administration will be more 
receptive to state needs than was president reagan whose 
administration dramatically reduced federal aid flowing to states 
i think hes already shown himself more receptive to domestic 
problems said republican gov thomas kean of new jersey who 
cited housing as the top domestic need 
michigans democratic gov james blanchard said bush has the 
potential of being from michigans point of view a better 
president than ronald reagan not necessarily more popular but more 
compassionate 
at the same time however governors voiced concern that bushs 
proposed federal budget for fiscal 1990 will bring another round of 
domestic spending cuts that will require increased spending by the 
states 
we wont become a kinder and gentler nation until we address 
our domestic needs such as children at risk the homeless and the 
mentally ill said washington states democratic gov booth 
gardner 
bushs 1988 democratic opponent massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis said hed wait to see whether bush follows through on 
domestic needs 
i hope so but im very concerned about his budget which is 
looking for cuts of over 5 billion in medicare and a number of 
other areas which will have a devastating effect on health care and 
important human needs dukakis said 
wyomings democratic gov mike sullivan gave bush generally 
good marks for at least establishing a kinder and gentler theme a 
desire to work cooperatively with the states 
the governors received a grim budget assessment from sasser 
however who said bushs budget is based on overly optimistic 
economic assumptions and leaves the tough decisions about where to 
cut domestic spending up to congress 
the sad reality of our fiscal circumstances is that theres 
substantial pain to be portioned out to the american people and im 
sorry to say that the portion of that pain likely to fall to state 
and local government is once again very substantial said sasser 
he said that while bush has asked for a lineitem veto power over 
the budget a tool many governors have he refuses to offer the 
congress this year a lineitem budget bushs budget proposal 
calls for spending limits without specifying many of the cuts that 
will be needed to accomplish the goals 
arkansas gov bill clinton a democrat voiced concern that 
bushs budget proposal has no money for the 800 million job 
training program that was part of the welfare reform pushed by the 
governors and enacted by congress 
blanchard said the states are hardpressed to deal with new 
obligations mandated by the federal government such as for expanded 
medicaid coverage without money to pay for them 
former secretary of state henry kissinger spoke to the governors 
and cautioned against high expectations of expanded trade with the 
soviet union 
to iowas gov terry branstad who asked about the prospects of 
increased trade with the soviets kissinger said i dont think 
its going to stimulate the economy of your state during your term 
of office 
the governors association executive committee approved 
resolutions putting the governors on record in support of 
selfdetermination for puerto rico uniform poll closing times 
across the country and easier voter registration 
but a deficitreduction plan that could have called for higher 
taxes under certain circumstances was withheld from a vote when what 
appeared to be a bipartisan consensus fell apart 
the cochairmen of the governors task force that worked on the 
plan democrat mario cuomo of new york and republican carroll 
campbell of south carolina backed off late last week after cuomo 
said it would incorporate a federal tax increase campbell said 
through spokesman tucker eskew that he wanted to strike language 
calling for higher taxes even in a doomsday scenario

the supreme court today agreed to use a case 
from the us virgin islands to decide whether federal juries may be 
told about a defendants alleged prior criminal conduct if a 
previous trial on those charges ended in acquittal 
the justices said they will review the bank robbery conviction 
and 70year prison sentence of reuben dowling 
federal prosecutors said dowling used a ski mask and a pistol to 
rob 7000 from the first pennsylvania bank in frederiksted st 
croix on july 8 1985 
at his trial prosecutors introduced evidence of dowlings 
alleged robbery of a private home weeks after the bank robbery 
occurred dowling previously had been tried and acquitted of charges 
stemming from the residential robbery 
a federal trial judge allowed prosecutors to introduce such 
evidence and the 3rd circuit court of appeals upheld that ruling 
the appeals court said the evidence should not have been admitted 
but its use was harmless meaning that dowling would have been 
convicted even if it had not been used 
in the appeal acted on today dowling argued that telling jurors 
about a crime for which he was acquitted violated his constitutional 
rights and should not have been ruled harmless error 
justice department lawyers argued that the evidence should not 
have been ruled inadmissible they said that although six federal 
appeals courts have barred such evidence three federal appeals 
courts have allowed it 
the case is dowling vs us 886025

washington state and the federal government 
have reached an agreement over cleaning up the hanford nuclear 
reservation which has become the most contaminated of the nations 
nuclear weapons production facilities 
washington gov booth gardner and officials of the department of 
energy and the environmental protection agency were signing the 
accord in a ceremony at the capitol today 
according to a draft summary of the 300page hanford action 
cleanup action plan circulated on capitol hill 
28 billion will needed over the next five years to begin the 
cleanup effort that is roughly twice what would be available under 
current budget guidelines that limit funding growth to 3 percent 
specific milestones will be included for actually cleaning up 
the reservation including an accelerated schedule for removing 
pumpable liquids from 149 aging singleshell underground tanks and 
constructing a vitrification plant to turn the wastes into a 
glasslike substance 
the justice department has decided that the agreement will be 
enforceable an issue that had been a key sticking point in 
negotiations 
in addition the federal government has agreed to provide 
washington 29 million over the next three years to fund the 
states oversight role 
if the needed congressional funding is provided and the agreement 
is carried forward the cleanup effort could add 2000 people to 
the hanford payroll by 1994 
the agreement was reached after more than a year of negotiations 
and amid threats that the state would seek a consent decree in 
court if negotiations failed 
besides being the most contaminated of the energy departments 16 
weaponsproductions sites the 570square mile reservation in 
southcentral washington is expected to be the most costly and 
longest to clean up 
the energy department estimated in january that it could cost up 
to 57 billion to manage and clean up the radioactive and toxic 
wastes at the reservation and even then hanford wouldnt be returned 
to a pristine condition 
stored at hanford is more than 60 percent of the nations 
highlevel radioactive waste generated by weapons programs dating 
back to world war ii 
according to some estimates more than 200 billion gallons of 
liquid radioactive waste have been dumped directly into the soil at 
hanford and roughly 1200 sites are seriously contaminated 
there have also been concerns that the contaminated liquids may 
be seeping into the groundwater deep beneath the reservation and 
could eventually reach the nearby columbia river 
scientists at the reservation worked on the atomic bomb that was 
dropped on nagasaki japan at the end of world war ii hanford was 
one of the largest weapons production complexes in the 1950s 
at present only one commercial nuclear power plant is operating 
at the reservation and the energy department has announced plans to 
phase out all weapons production activities at the site

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether the rights of white criminal defendants may be violated when 
blacks are excluded from serving as jurors in their trials 
the justices said they will hear an appeal by daniel holland a 
chicagoarea white man sentenced to 85 years in prison for rape 
kidnaping and armed robbery 
the high court in 1986 ruled that prosecutors never may 
disqualify potential jurors based on their race the ruling 
dramatically curtailed the traditonally broad power of prosecutors 
to eliminate prospective jurors from trials by using peremptory or 
automatic challenges 
but that case involved a black defendant and jurors of his race 
the justices have not decided whether exclusion of black jurors in 
this manner can violate the rights of a white defendant 
in hollands case two blacks among the more than 30 prospective 
jurors were excluded by the prosecution from serving on the panel 
that eventually convicted him 
prosecutors said they were not motivated by racial considerations 
when they used their peremptory challenges to exclude the two 
blacks a man and a woman from the jury 
the illinois supreme court said that as a white person holland 
lacked legal standing to raise the issue of whether race played a 
part in the exclusion of the two blacks 
we decline to address this issue because we find that the 
defendant a caucasian does not have standing to assert such a 
constitutional violation the state court said 
the state court also rejected hollands argument that he was 
denied his constitutional right to be tried by a fair crosssection 
of the community 
holland was convicted in the rape and kidnaping of a des plaines 
ill teenage girl on may 4 1980 
prosecutors said holland gave a ride to the girl and her 
boyfriend they said he forced the boyfriend to leave the car and 
raped the girl at knifepoint 
holland was arrested hours after the assault when a police 
stopped his car because it had no rear license plate 
the case is holland vs illinois 885050

the supreme court today agreed to take a fresh 
look at how far cities may go to limit sexually oriented businesses 
the court will study a dallas zoning and licensing ordinance 
challenged by owners of adult bookstores motion picture theaters 
nightclubs motels and nudemodel studios 
the challengers say the law violates their freedom of expression 
last week the high court ruled in an indiana case that states 
may use antiracketeering laws to crack down on pornography but in 
that case the court also ruled that businesses dealing with sexually 
explicit materials may not be shut down before a judicial 
determination that at least some of the materials are obscene 
the 1986 dallas ordinance requires that sexually oriented 
businesses be at least 1000 feet apart and at least 1000 feet from 
any church school residential area or park 
any existing business in violation of the regulation has three 
years to move or shut down 
the businesses also are required to obtain a license issued by 
the chief of police and must permit inspection of their premises 
during operating hours 
also the ordinance bars anyone convicted of a variety of crimes 
such as promotion of prostitution from operating a sexually 
oriented business and it requires that viewing rooms in adult 
theaters be open to permit surveillance by management 
the regulations also bar motel owners from renting rooms for less 
than 10 hours a provision designed to discourage prostitution 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals ruled last february that 
the ordinance is a legitimate attack on crime urban blight and 
declining property values 
the appeals court noted that the supreme court in 1986 upheld a 
somewhat similar ordinance in renton wash restricting the 
location of adult theaters 
operators of adult entertainment outlets in dallas said the 
regulations in the texas city are much stricter they said dozens of 
businesses will be forced to shut down because at least 106 
establishments must relocate and there are only 50 available 
locations 
but the 5th circuit court said the dallas ordinance does not 
violate free speech or other rights protected by the constitution 
the city councils consideration of the criminal effects of 
concentrated sexually oriented businesses was thorough as was its 
review of the effects such concentrations have on property values 
the appeals court said in short dallas has demonstrated that the 
ordinance furthers a substantial government interest 
the appeals court also said the city demonstrated a compelling 
justification for its licensing requirements even though a 
lessstrict standard would be adequate to uphold the regulations 
for example the city need only show that a criminal 
conviction and the evil to be regulated bear a substantial 
relationship the appeals court said 
it added that the discretion given the police chief under the 
ordinance to issue suspend and revoke licenses is not impermissibly 
broad 
the appeals court also rejected arguments that the city ordinance 
violates privacy rights by insisting that establishments offering 
sexually oriented entertainment be open to inspection by authorities 
without search warrants 
in other action the court 
agreed to decide whether the rights of white criminal 
defendants may be violated when blacks are excluded from serving as 
jurors in their trials 
the justices said they will hear an appeal by daniel holland a 
chicagoarea white man sentenced to 85 years in prison for rape 
kidnaping and armed robbery 
turned down a challenge to his conviction by bernhard goetz 
who in 1984 shot four young men he said were going to rob him on a 
new york city subway 
the court without comment rejected arguments that goetz weas 
denied a fair trial goetz who was sentenced to a year in jail and 
fined 5000 began his imprisonment at the rikers island jail in 
new york city last month he is eligible for but not assured of 
parole after 51 days 
refused to revive an affirmative action program in south bend 
ind that called for hiring more blacks and hispanics as 
firefighters and police officers 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that struck down 
the plan after it was challenged by a white man denied a job as a 
firefighter 
rejected reverse discrimination arguments by a white 
vallejo calif firefighter denied a promotion that went to a black 
man with a slightly lower test score 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that upheld the 
black mans promotion to help achieve better racial balance within 
the fire department 
let stand a ruling that someone who plans a bank robbery but is 
arrested before actually moving toward the bank may not be convicted 
of violating a federal law prohibiting attempted bank robbery 
the court over two dissenting votes rejected a justice 
department appeal that sought reinstatement of an attempted bank 
robbery conviction in a california case 
turned down appeals by former rep mario biaggi dny and 
former brooklyn ny democratic boss meade esposito aimed at 
overturning their convictions for exchanging illegal gratuities 
the court without comment cleared the way for biaggis 
imprisonment on a 2year term esposito was sentenced to two years 
probation and 500 hours of community service

president bush today pledged continued 
troop support for south korea and called for lower trade barriers as 
he wrapped up a fiveday asian trip and headed home to a fierce 
political battle over john towers nomination to head the pentagon 
i have come here today as the leader of a faithful friend and a 
dependable ally bush said in a speech to the south korean 
national assembly that highlighted his quick stopover in seoul the 
president boarded air force one at 524 pm local time 324 am 
est for the nearly 15hour return trip to washington he made a 
brief stop in alaska for refueling just before noon est 
the presidents audience applauded when he pledged to keep the 
42000 us troops on duty as protection against north korea but 
sat quietly when he talked of trade 
i want you to have this direct from me if we are to keep our 
bilateral relationships growing even stronger much more needs to be 
done to ease trading relations said the president 
although bushs south korean visit was limited to five hours a 
security force of 120000 police agents and commandos was put on 
top alert to protect him against threats ranging from radical 
students to north korean infiltrators 
about 700 radical students shouting bush go home battled 
riot police with firebombs and rocks during a 45minute clash around 
dongguk university in an abortive attempt to march on the us 
embassy about three miles away 
earlier police arrested about 15 prominent dissidents shouting 
no bush visit who had tried to assemble about a block from the 
embassy in downtown seoul 
minutes after they were hauled away bushs helicopter flew 
overhead on its way to the blue house the nearby presidential 
mansion after his arrival from china at a secure military base 
outside seoul police also clashed with demonstrators in five other 
cities including the site of a us air base south of seoul 
from seoul bush was flying back to washington and the sternest 
political test so far of his young administration the storm over 
the tower nomination the appointment is in danger of rejection in 
the democraticcontrolled senate and the president has pledged to 
mount a personal lobbying campaign to salvage it 
bushs brief visit in seoul included a luncheon for which the 
participants took off shoes and donned slippers guests sat on a 
heated floor on cushions with hard backs but the 6foot2 bush had 
trouble stretching his legs asking his hosts do you put your 
legs straight our or do you fold them up 
the president made his rounds of seoul by helicopter as he met 
with president roh taewoo a democratically elected leader who 
replaced the countrys unpopular military dictatorship addressed 
the south korean national assembly and greeted us embassy 
employees 
in the blue house meeting bush and roh held a 15minute meeting 
that included discussions on the trade issue korea has benefitted 
from the united states open market bush said in remarks to 
reporters after the session 
roh voiced support for free markets throughout the world he said 
that both he and bush had agreed to work to resolve various 
problems resulting from the rapid expansion of economic relations 
between our two countries 
roh said he had briefed bush on all our efforts for the 
reduction of tension and consolidation of peace on the korean 
peninsula including what he called a forwardlooking policy 
toward north korea 
bush traveled to south korea from beijing and his final hours in 
china were marred when authorities prevented the nations top 
dissident fang lizhi from attending a sunday night banquet given 
by the visiting president 
the white house said bush did not know of the incident at the 
time but on his departure today from beijing expressed regret to 
foreign minister wu xueqian according to white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater 
contradicting a statement he made a day earlier fitzwater also 
said bush did raise the issue of human rights problems privately 
in china 
the presidents visit in seoul was intended to reaffirm the us 
commitment to korean security while at the same time register 
concern about barriers to american exports to seoul which has a 
nearly 9 billion trade surplus with the united states 
i know that there must be times when this body just like the 
united states congress is full of noise contention and emotion 
bush said in his speech to the assembly 
but that is the sound of democracy at work and we wouldnt have 
it any other way he said 
north korea greeted bushs trip to the south with a signed 
commentary in rodong sinmun the organ of the central committee of 
the ruling korean workers communist party declaring that the vow 
to keep us troops in south korea was a revelation of the us 
imperialists unsatiated ambition for permanent occupation of south 
korea the commentary was reported in a broadcast of the official 
korean central news agency that was monitored in tokyo 
bushs trip came at a period of more public criticism of us 
policies than at any time in four decades radical students and 
dissidents complain that the presence of 42000 troops hinders 
unification talks with the north 
farmers and businessmen charge that washington is exerting undue 
pressure to liberalize korean import rules 
pledging not to cut back on us forces bush said they will 
remain as long as they are needed and as long as we believe it is 
in the interest of peace to keep them there 
he praised south korea as a worldclass economic power and 
said your commitment to democracy is demonstrated daily in this 
chamber 
bush called the korean economy an inspiration to developing 
countries 
yet he said we also cannot overlook that your economic 
success has created concerns in uskorean relations 
for the american people and for the korean people as well 
reducing our bilateral trade imbalance will be both a challenge and 
an opportunity the president said 
the challenge will be to resist calls for protectionism the 
opportunity will be to expand the prosperity of both our countries 
bush said the american people share your goal of peaceful 
unification with the north on terms acceptable to the korean 
people it is for that reason that we actively support the peaceful 
initiatives of president roh to build bridges to the north 
on the eve of the visit in seoul bushs national security 
adviser brent scowcroft acknowledged that theres been a lot of 
unrest in korea 
theres been an antiamerican tone to some of it one of the 
reasons the presidents going there is to reassure the south koreans 
of our support for their moves toward democracy and of the firmness 
of our strategic relationship 
asked if seoul was moving fast enough on human rights 
improvements scowcroft said i think theyre moving you know 
fast enough thats a very value judgment i think theyre moving 
koreans have gone a long way from where they were a short time ago 
i think we need to be patient as they feel their way through toward 
a mature democratic system

yugoslavias presidency imposed 
special measures in the southern province of kosovo today as 
military vehicles moved toward a mine where 1300 workers remained 
underground on strike 
meanwhile one of the miners primary demands was met when the 
provinces communist party leader rahman morina resigned the 
yugolsav news agency tanjug reported 
there was no immediate response from the strikers who had been 
holed up for eight days in the trepca lead and zinc mines in titova 
mitrovica 
military planes twice flew over pristina kosovos capital and 
armed vehicles were seen heading toward titova mitrovica 
tanjug said the presidency of yugoslavia today ordered that 
special measures be introduced in kosovo for protecting the 
constitutional order 
the implementation of these measures was effective immediately 
the public has not yet been informed of the precise measures 
involved 
the agency did not give further details on the special 
measures 
the announcement came after tanjug reported the miners said they 
were cutting off outside contacts except for medical assistance 
until morina stepped down 
he later resigned and radio belgrade quoted him as saying i am 
deeply shaken that you consider me responsible for your lives and 
health it is only for this purpose that i am submitting the 
resignation 
but 800 miners from the slav minority in kosovo descended into 
another lead and zinc mine today and said they would remain 
underground if morina stepped down 
like the majority of miners morina is an ethnic albanian but 
the miners believe he is too supportive of serbia one of 
yugoslavias six republics 
kosovo is part of serbia but is actually an autonomous province 
the miners fear that proposals to change yugoslavias constitution 
would increase serbias control of the province 
serbian leaders claim tighter control is necessary to protect the 
slav minority which claims persecution by the ethnic albanians 
the ethnic albanian miners also have demanded the resignations of 
husamedin azemi the communist party leader in pristina and ali 
sukrija a representative of kosovo in the national party leadership 
azemi also resigned today citing moral considerations and 
blackmail sukrija can only submit his resignation to the federal 
leadership in belgrade 
earlier today the communist leadership of yugoslavia appealed to 
the miners to stop imperiling your health and lives and come out 
of the mine tanjug reported 
at least 550 exhausted miners have requested medical assistance 
the news agency said 
on saturday the presidency a nineman collective body that 
commands yugoslavias armed forces ordered greater internal 
security in kosovo and extra police units were brought in 
more police than usual patrolled pristina streets today and 
soldiers guarded key buildings and army barracks police roadblocks 
were seen on some roads leading into kosovo travelers reported 
riza muslimi a spokesman for the strikers said saturday that 
they had stashed two tons of explosives underground he refused to 
say if they planned to blow up the mining complex if their demands 
which include management changes at the mine werent met 
yugoslavias economy has deteriorated since 1980 and the nations 
standard of living has been in steep decline 
the jobless rate last year was 15 percent and citizens staged 
huged demonstrations calling for changes in the nations leadership

information exchanged by 20 law enforcement 
officers familiar with serial killer ted bundy will be analyzed 
further to see if other crimes can be linked to him the fbi said 
today 
information exchanged at the conference will be used to build a 
model of homicides typically committed by ted bundy the fbi said 
in a statement after a weeklong meeting of bundy investigators 
ended this model will be compared against crimes that are 
unsolved in which he remains a suspect 
bundy was executed jan 24 in florida for the 1978 murder of 
kimberly diane leach of lake city fla 
in the days before his death bundy confessed to 23 killings 
across the west although he did not provide 23 names and also gave 
information that authorities said might linke him to other cases he 
had been convicted of three killings in florida 
some investigators believe the onetime law student who became 
americas most notorious serial killer have slain more than 100 
women as far back as two decades ago 
the fbi said the goal of the conference was to determine the 
scope of bundys activities 
a chronological listing of his travels and activities will be 
charted by the fbi visual investigative analysis unit the fbi 
statement said this process will consist of a detailed 
examination of police records from around the country 
fbi special agent william hagmaier who was present with bundy at 
all of his interviews with investigators and was the last law 
enforcement official to speak with the serial killer said he 
believed conference participants came away with some useful 
information 
some people were brought in who had not had an opportunity to 
take confessions but were familiar with his crime scenes hagmaier 
said were discussing his methods of operation and his 
whereabouts in various cases to determine the practicality of 
considering him a suspect

a moderate earthquake rattled southcentral 
utah today and seismologists said the temblor was an unusual late 
aftershock of a larger quake that struck the same area a month 
earlier 
the university of utah seismograph stations reported the quake 
measured 42 on the richter scale and was centered 16 miles 
southeast of salina in a remote mountainous area of the sevier 
plateau 
it caused no apparent damages or injuries but was felt by 
residents in sevier emery and sanpete counties said senior staff 
seismologist sue nava 
a quake of magnitude 54 that struck jan 29 was located in the 
same precise spot nava said todays temblor was an aftershock of 
the larger quake which caused minor damage and was reported felt 
throughout utah and parts of wyoming colorado and arizona 
it is somewhat unusual but certainly possible for an 
aftershock to occur a month later nava said the latest quake also 
occurred deeper than most rumbling about 15 miles underground she 
added 
since the january quake there have been about 50 aftershocks 
along the sevier plateau but most were too small to be felt she 
said 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude 
an earthquake of 4 on the richter scale can cause moderate damage 
in the local area

john towers pledge to swear off alcohol if 
approved as defense secretary left two undecided senate democrats 
unmoved today and pledging they will go over all evidence on the 
nominees character before deciding how to vote 
a third democratic senator considered by some a swing vote bob 
graham of florida said he is leaning against the nomination despite 
towers pledge 
i think it the pledge helps but its not just the drinking 
which is a problem to me graham said in miami 
its a pattern of bad judgment bad judgment in the 1970s in 
drinking bad judgment by placing himself in compromising positions 
as the us arms negotiator in geneva in the mid80s bad judgment 
in accepting large sums from the defense industry in the late 
1980s 
sen howell heflin of alabama one of several southern democrats 
still considered open to the white house lobbying effort for tower 
said on abcs good morning america that he has to review all 
the evidence im trying to be openminded judicial and fair about 
it 
sen john breaux dla said on the abc program that he would 
vote against tower if the vote were today despite the embattled 
nominees extraordinary pledge on sunday 
i think that if we have a serious doubt if any senator has a 
serious doubt about the competence of a candidate that he should 
err on the side of safety said breaux in that case it 
indicates voting negatively 
asked whether towers promise to refrain from drinking had swayed 
him heflin said he plans to read the classified fbi report on tower 
today and will review the evidence of the drinking problem 
heflin said he will consider does he have a drinking problem 
that might be a detriment to the united states national security 
and does he have a temptation propensity that might return to 
drink 
sen orrin hatch rutah said on cbs this morning 
meanwhile that towers vow should put the drinking questions to 
rest because john tower is a man of his word so i think that 
particular issue ought to be gone 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine held a 
latemorning meeting on the tower nomination with minority leader 
bob dole rkan neither would comment afterward 
sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the senate 
armed services committee said he would have no comment on towers 
pledge the senator said he would be meeting with colleagues off 
and on during the day 
warner planned to meet with president bush on tuesday to discuss 
the nomination 
tower made his pledge against the alcohol in televised interviews 
sunday saying he would be obliged to resign if he broke the vow 
at the same time sen sam nunn dga said he might reconvene 
armed services committee confirmation hearings to hear testimony in 
public about the former texas senators drinking habits 
the committee chairman coupled his statement with a complaint 
that the white house was leaking information from the fbis 
background report on tower in a bid to rescue the nomination 
nunn also expressed concern about towers ties to defense 
consultants and the appearance of conflict of interest over a 
twoyear period tower received more than 1 million in consulting 
fees from such industry giants as rockwell and martin marietta 
the georgia senator in the nbc interview noted that tower 
served as a us arms control negotiator in geneva and then advised 
defense companies on arms control efforts on the weapons they build 
its a tough line to draw nunn said but i do believe that 
john tower crossed that line 
nunns democraticcontrolled committee voted 119 along party 
lines last thursday to recommend that the full senate reject towers 
nomination with the chairman citing allegations of excessive 
drinking by the nominee 
the comments today and sunday were a prelude to an intense week 
of political maneuvering over the nomination which the full senate 
is expected to debate beginning at midweek 
president bush intends to take personal charge of the lobbying 
campaign for tower and has invited several democrats to the white 
house to discuss the issue later in the week 
but tower wasnt waiting for bush to return home from his asian 
trip 
noting the principal concern of senator nunn and other members 
of the senate relative to my confirmation as secretary of defense 
namely the extent to which i may engage in excessive use of beverage 
alcohol let me state that i have never been an alcoholic nor 
dependent on alcohol tower said in a statement he read on 
abctvs this week with david brinkley and cable news networks 
newsmaker sunday 
i hearby swear and undertake that if confirmed during the 
course of my tenure as secretary of defense i will not consume 
beverage alcohol of any type or form including wine beer or 
spirits of any kind he said 
tower also vowed that if he broke his pledge not to drink he 
would step down i think id be obliged to resign if i broke the 
pledge ive never broken a pledge in my life said the former 
senator 
dole called towers pledge very very significant and urged 
democrats and republicans to reassess the nomination 
my view is it ought to be a new ball game we ought to sit down 
and try to work it out and spare any hard feelings dole said 
mitchell said towers pledge is another factor to be 
considered 
nunn had no comment on towers pledge according to arnold 
punaro a member of the armed services committee staff 
president bush begins courting undecided democrats on tuesday in 
hopes of capturing enough votes for tower to win confirmation 
democrats hold a 5545 majority in the senate meaning bush must 
pick up at least five democrats to assure towers confirmation 
tower in the interviews also read from a letter from his doctor 
saying tests last month found that he had normal liver functions and 
there was no evidence of alcohol impairment or alcoholism 
in the interview with cnn tower acknowledged that he was a heavy 
drinker during the 1970s but denied that he had a drinking problem 
drank to excess i wouldnt say that i had a problem that is to 
say i wasnt hooked on it i wasnt dependent on it i did drink 
too much he said 
on the abc program the onetime chairman of the armed services 
committee and former us arms control negotiator conceded that 
there was a point in his life when he changed his drinking habits 
twelve years ago i gave up spirits i used to be a pretty good 
scotch drinker i havent tasted scotch in 12 years after that i 
had only wine and perhaps an occasional martini occasionally a 
little vodka with smoked salmon caviar something like that that 
was just occasionally 
i really essentially have been a wine drinker now my only 
consumption is wine at meals 
tower has been dogged by allegations of both excessive drinking 
and womanizing 
pressed by interviewer sam donaldson about whether he would 
pledge not to see women the former senator asked the abc newsman to 
define womanizer in what became a heated exchange 
now when allegations are raised that youre a womanizer 
should you take a pledge not to go out with women donaldson asked 
im a single man i do date women said the twicedivorced 
tower

earthquake deaths last year nearly tripled the 
worlds annual average largely as a result of the tragic armenian 
tremor the us geological survey reported monday 
the years loss of life in earth tremors was the worst in more 
than a decade and occurred despite a decline in the total number of 
significant earthquales reported during the year survey officials 
reported 
the exact number of deaths remains unknown but is likely nearly 
triple the average annual toll of about 10000 fatalities worldwide 
a year earlier in 1987 only 1100 lives had been lost in 
earthquakes 
the 1988 toll is the most since 1976 when at least 250000 people 
were killed in an earthquake in china 
the geological survey said it is using a low estimate of 25000 
deaths in the dec 7 tremor in armenia that figure is the soviet 
government estimate some other reports have been much higher 
the armenian quake with a magnitude of 68 on the richter scale 
also injured 13000 people and left more than a halfmillion 
homeless 
the main shock was followed within minutes by a second tremor 
measuring 58 on the richter scale which estimates the energy 
released by a tremor a quake of 50 can cause considerable damage 
and the strength rises by 10 times for each whole number on the 
scale 
collapsing buildings were blamed for many of the deaths in 
armenia as the quake rattled concrete structures until they fell to 
the ground according to subsequent analyses 
another quake in the soviet union claiming about 1000 lives 
later struck in soviet central asia that tremor occurred in 
january however and so does not count in the 1988 toll 
the second most deadly quake of 1988 came on aug 20 when about 
1000 people died as a result of a tremor on the nepalindia border 
that quake measured 66 on the richter scale it destroyed thousands 
of homes and injured many 
on nov 6 a quake measuring 73 on the scale claimed 730 lives 
and injured about 4000 people on the border between burma and 
china the geological survey reported 
and on the indiaburma border three deaths were reported in an 
aug 6 quake that caused landslides 
the survey said it recorded 61 significant quakes last year 15 
fewer than the year before a quake is considered significant if it 
has a magnitude of 65 on the richter scale tremors of lesser 
magnitude are included if they cause casualties or considerable 
damage 
three significant quakes were recorded in the united states last 
year including the strongest shock of the year that tremor 
measured at 76 occurred march 6 in the gulf of alaska and resulted 
in only minor damage 
the only us earthquake death last year was a heart attack 
following a quake measured at 48 in whittier calif in february 
the other significant us quake occurred dec 3 in pasadena calif 
it was measured at 46 on the scale but caused some injuries and 
property damage 
a quake centered in eastern canada on nov 25 was felt widely 
across that country and in the northeastern united states as far 
south as washington the survey reported it had a magnitude of 57 
quakes in the eastern part of north america tend to be felt over 
larger areas than tremors of similar strength in the west 
europe recorded three earthquake deaths last year when a tremor 
rated at 30 killed a group of miners in czechoslovakia on sept 2 
in addition a tremor rated at 58 caused several injuries in 
albania on jan 9 
injuries were also reported from two offshore quakes one in the 
ionian sea near greece oct 16 and another near the azores islands 
nov 21 
in africa eight persons working in a gold mine in south africa 
died jan 5 in an earthquake rated at 52 
and japan usually very seismically active recorded only one 
significant quake last year the survey reported that tremor 
measured 54 and resulted in 10 injuries and minor damage in the 
tokyo area

a team of american psychiatrists is embarking on a 
twoweek review of soviet psychiatry including interviews with two 
dozen patients western human rights activists suspect are being held 
for political reasons 
the soviet union says it has ended abuses and is interested in 
rejoining the world psychiatry association from which it withdrew 
in 1983 under pressure from western countries that accused it of 
using psychiatry for political purposes 
the purpose of our visit will be to assess insofar as possible 
and in a limited period of time changes in soviet policies laws 
and treatment practices in the field of forensic psychiatry said 
robert w farrand a us state department official leading the 
20member team 
he described the visit which ends march 12 as unprecedented 
soviet human rights activists said recently that 2030 mentally 
healthy people still are held in mental hospitals for political 
reasons 
loren h roth head of the law and psychiatry program at the 
university of pittsburgh and the medical leader said the group 
expects to interview 2530 soviets whose cases have been raised by 
western human rights campaigners 
these are the patients whose cases are perhaps best known he 
said 
farrand told reporters monday the soviets are giving the group 
access to all the patients whose cases they asked to review but 
delegation officials added there was no way they could ensure other 
people unknown to human rights activists are not being held for 
political reasons 
delegation members said they have been given medical records for 
most of the patients and expect to receive more before they begin 
examinations 
patients will be given a choice of speaking only to the american 
group or to have a soviet psychiatrist present as well they said 
the american group includes five psychiatrists who are former 
soviet citizens they will conduct the interviews in russian and 
screen out any cultural bias in the examinations the group said 
patients will be tested for any drugs that are being 
administered and the delegation has asked soviet psychiatrists to 
present the patients as they normally live 
the group eventually will issue a report on its findings but 
wont identify the patients to protect their privacy 
one official said the group planned to avoid publicity while in 
the soviet union because the chemistry of this is very delicate 
it also will visit two psychiatric hospitals that human rights 
activists say once held political prisoners and two that never have 
been so identified 
delegation officials said the visits to the latter would allow 
them to assess the general state of soviet psychiatric care 
abuse of psychiatry in the soviet union has been a contentious 
issue between the superpowers for decades 
as part of mikhail s gorbachevs reforms some psychiatric 
hospitals were transferred from police control to control by the 
health ministry a new law made it a crime to commit a sane person 
to a mental hospital 
last month georgy morozov head of the soviet psychiatric 
society said there were no more people held in psychiatric 
hospitals for political reasons 
officials of the us delegation said their investigation was not 
directly aimed at moscows effort to be readmitted to the world 
association but that the issue was likely to come up when the 
organization meets in october

president mikhail s gorbachevs 
confrontation with the last brezhnev man on the politburo has 
ignited rising local opposition to stubborn old guard of the ukraine 
for a long time peoples mouths were sewn shut said ivan 
drach a writer who heads the narodni rykh or peoples movement 
now people in many situations are seeking to speak out 
in a fourday campaign through the soviet unions second most 
populous republic last week gorbachev ordered ukrainian communist 
party boss vladimir shcherbitsky and his political machine to start 
backing perestroika 
the ukrainian government responded with a crackdown on 
protesters arresting human rights activists within hours of 
gorbachevs departure on sunday paramilitary police shoved 6000 
people from a downtown square when speeches at a cultural rally 
turned to politics 
the gorbachev showdown coincided with a ukrainian reform movement 
that in the last three months has shaken off 17 years of repression 
under shcherbitsky the narodni rykh formed in november but not 
permitted to publish its program until 10 days ago is one of 
several new organizations in kiev calling for change 
the new ukrainian language society on jan 27 persuaded the 
republics parliament to begin work on a law making ukrainian the 
official language a society seeking to reveal the crimes of 
dictator josef stalin is getting organized and a committee for 
democratic elections is protesting the removal of certain candidates 
from balloting for the new parliament 
as gorbachevs calls for modernization in the ukraine dominated 
soviet tv news last week shcherbitsky was shown standing 
stonefaced behind the kremlin leader 
we always had these ideas said boris oliinyk a reformer on 
the ukrainian communist party central committee we just couldnt 
work on them earlier 
gorbachev called reform leaders into a meeting of communist party 
officials and sided with the reformers shcherbitsky sat and 
listened two elated reformers said afterward 
the kremlin leader also ordered ukrainian communist party leaders 
to pay more attention to democratization elected bodies and 
rankandfile party members he told workers on the streets of kiev 
they should oust bosses who dont perform well 
reversing local authorities gorbachev also promised that a 
controversial nuclear power plant wouldnt begin operations unless 
declared safe by american experts 
in setting ukrainian activists free to push for change gorbachev 
risks igniting nationalism but his attempt to overhaul the nations 
economy cannot succeed without reform in the ukraine the 
industrial and agricultural heart of the soviet union 
gorbachev himself brought up the danger of ukrainian nationalism 
warning miners in donetsk that the country could not afford ethnic 
disturbances in a republic of 50 million people when strife in the 
smaller republics of armenia and azerbaijan was so damaging 
drach said gorbachev has allowed shcherbitsky to remain in power 
this long because of this fear of stirring up the ukraine to the 
boiling point 
as a result the ukraine has seen virtually no glasnost 
activists said crimes of stalin being examined by a politburo 
commission and the national press are out of bounds for ukrainian 
newspapers demonstrations that have met little or no resistance in 
moscow and the baltics have been broken up in the ukraine said oles 
shevchenko head of the local helsinki watch group 
economic innovations such as private cooperatives and leasing 
have been rare said writer yuri shcherbak environmental concerns 
about radiation from the chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion 
have been ignored 
demonstrators in kiev last week called for shcherbitskys defeat 
in the upcoming election although he is running unopposed 
at the conclusion of sundays rally on the preservation of 
ancient kiev paramilitary police stormed the square after human 
rights activists announced their demonstrations had been canceled 
since gorbachevs departure because of the arrest of protest 
organizers some in the crowd responded to the strongarmed tactics 
of the police with anger screaming nazis 
shcherbak said the burgeoning populist movements have their roots 
in public anger over the chernobyl disaster government secrecy 
about the resulting radiation sparked an environmental movement that 
won permission to hold a meeting in november that drew an estimated 
20000 people 
the meeting ended with calls to form the peoples movement 
modeled on the popular fronts in the baltic states 
everyone wants to live better to breathe more freely to feel 
himself a person not a slave drach said 
where ukrainians once were afraid to mention shcherbitskys name 
there now are open calls for his ouster 
people lack faith in the old leaders particularly 
shcherbitsky drach said 
he is old sick and he must go said shcherbak i think he 
will go soon in the ukraine we very much need a leader 
the first signal of a potentially important change in the 
ukrainian communist party leadership since the 1982 death of leonid 
brezhnev came in december when a gorbachev man vladimir ivashko 
was named shcherbitskys deputy 
in the baltics communists have joined the reform groups but in 
kiev the deputy director of the helsinki watch group anatoly 
nahirnyak was expelled from the party last week shevchenko said 
there are progressive people in the party shcherbak said 
but they cant do anything yet 
now however the reformers believe they have gorbachev on their 
side 
gorbachev himself said he needs people who wont run away from 
difficult problems shcherbak said gorbachev made it clear he 
added that if such people are found in the outside reform 
organizations they should be brought into the mainstream fight for 
change

cabinet status for the veterans administration 
does not automatically mean more money the man designated to head 
the new department told the nations largest veterans group monday 
we realize that with the budget problems facing this 
administration were not going to be the priority group edward 
j derwinski told an american legion meeting we dont want any 
false expectations any false hopes in the field 
after his speech derwinski told reporters he does not believe he 
will be able to win extra money for the new department in the 
current fiscal year it was his first such admission though he 
earlier had said he had not won over the office of management and 
budget to his view that the veterans administration needs more funds 
a legion spokesman said supplemental funds were essential this 
year 
the va on march 15 becomes the department of veterans affairs 
the governments newest and secondlargest cabinet department 
derwinski is scheduled to go before the senate veterans affairs 
committee on tuesday for a closed hearing that is expected to delve 
into his admitted tipping off of the south korean embassy in 1975 
that a member of the korean central intelligence agency was about to 
defect 
on monday derwinski began his speech with the warning the 
first thing we have to appreciate and it isnt easy to accept is 
that there isnt an automatic pot of gold at the end of the rainbow 
merely by being called a department he returned to that theme 
several times 
though congress intended to enhance the influence of the agency 
both inside and outside the administration through elevation to 
cabinet status he said it isnt something that is going to 
happen overnight its going to take time its going to take 
salesmanship its going to take special effort 
speaking with reporters afterward derwinski said he was seeking 
an extra 520 million for the 1990 fiscal year beginning oct 1 
almost all of it for medical care 
if there is an 89 supplemental which i doubt well have a 
shot there he said 
veterans administration officials have said since fall the 108 
billion budgeted for medical care this year is 600 million to 1 
billion short and the veterans committees of both houses have urged 
the administration to seek additional funds 
last week the house veterans affairs committee recommended to 
the house budget committee additional spending this year of 520 
million 83 percent of it for medical care and 13 billion more 
for next year 85 percent of it for medical care 
total spending by the veterans administration is budgeted at 
2977 billion in the current year president bush proposed 2996 
billion for 1990 of which 1099 billion would be for medical care 
jim hanson a spokesman for the american legion said when told 
that derwinski did not expect a supplemental appropriation in the 
current fiscal year i think wed be terribly disappointed its 
essential 
its a terrifying thought that theyd start closing more beds 
in the 130 va hospitals hanson said 
sparky gierke of bismarck nd national commander of the 
american legion exhorted derwinski after the speech to be the 
strong voice of the veterans and carry the water of the american 
veteran and not that of the office of management and budget

federal agents apprehended 79 suspected illegal 
aliens today as an eastern airlines flight from los angeles made a 
stopover here 
we believe this is one of the largest operations weve 
conducted that involves illegal aliens on board commercial aircraft 
here in the us said thomas p fischer district director of the 
atlanta office of the immigration and naturalization service 
this may be part of a massive alien smuggling operation he 
said adding that the ins would continue to target such flights 
ins agents acting on tips from confidential sources at 
hartsfield atlanta international airport and from undercover 
operations around los angeles boarded the plane shortly after its 
arrival said ins spokesman tom thomas the plane was bound for new 
york 
we had about 25 immigration agents on the case thomas said 
thomas said the ins sources indicated it had been a regular 
occurrence for the past 30 days for illegal aliens to use the same 
flight and he estimated that thousands of illegal aliens had been 
smuggled across the country on eastern airliners 
it appears at this point from our sources that its almost a 
daily occurrence he said he said he didnt know how the aliens 
had gotten into the country 
thomas said eastern had been very cooperative in the 
investigation adding we dont in any way connect eastern and 
dont want to intimate that they were even remotely involved at this 
point 
in miami today eastern airlines spokeswoman virginia sanchez 
said all i know is that the ins had told us theyd be monitoring 
a flight this week and of course we cooperated with them 
thirtynine of the suspected aliens were from mexico 22 from 
guatemala 13 from the dominican republic three from el salvador 
and one each from honduras and ecuador they were to be transferred 
to ins processing centers in florida and texas for deportations he 
said 
they were among 179 passengers who boarded in los angeles 
we suspect that a smuggler assists them in boarding the 
aircraft in los angeles thomas said adding that the aliens 
likely are greeted in new york by relatives and another smuggler

few from the west get to see north korea the 
hermit of asia but associated press correspondent cinty li who is 
based in hong kong recently was allowed to travel to pyongyang for 
a rare look at whats going on in a country that has largely sealed 
itself off for four decades 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
along the wide and immaculately 
clean streets of pyongyang women with their heads wrapped in white 
scarfs and men bundled up against the winter morning cold trudge off 
to work 
most walk alone their faces stern their steps steady many wear 
a tiny enamel picture pin of president kim il sung the omnipotent 
dictator who has ruled the communist nation throughout its four 
decades of existence 
pyongyang is the capital of one of the worlds most insular and 
repressive countries which is frequently accused of terrorist 
activity and basic human rights violations 
but this hermit of the world has begun to show stirrings of more 
contact with the outside world particularly with its two main foes 
the united states and south korea 
the korean peninsula was divided into a communist north and 
capitalist south after world war ii although the two sides have yet 
to sign a peace treaty after their 19501953 war they are engaged 
in cautious attempts to ease tension by talking about topics ranging 
from a nonagression pact to trade 
meanwhile north korean and us diplomats recently met in 
beijing chinas capital in a rare display of direct contact 
in july pyongyang will play host to the 13th world festival of 
youth and students a gathering of communist and socialist youth 
groups that north korea expects will attract about 20000 delegates 
from more than 100 nations the city also is under consideration as 
site for the 1989 world student games 
north korea eagerly awaits the 13th world festival and hopes it 
will enhance the countrys international stature particularly after 
the humiliation of watching seoul the south korean capital 
successfully stage the summer olympics last year 
with the opening day of the festival approaching our hearts 
are rushing to its venue kim dong yong head of a train passenger 
car workshop wrote in a typically worded article in the official 
magazine korea today 
colorful posters announcing the coming festival for 
antiimperialist solidarity peace and friendship dot the 
otherwise drab landscape of pyongyang 
tourists who come to the capital are shown the facilities under 
construction for the event including the 150000seat rungnado 
stadium on an island in the river tae dong and a 105story building 
said to be the worlds tallest hotel 
what festivalgoers will see when they visit pyongyang is perhaps 
the worlds ultimate communist capital unfettered by grand 
reminders of a noncommunist past while moscow has the kremlin and 
beijing has the imperial forbidden city modern pyongyang was built 
from rubble after the korean war 
today it is a city of 2 million residents blocks of tall and 
uninspired apartments and sixlane streets uncluttered by vehicles 
leaving traffic police plenty of rest as they mechanically direct 
the occasional bus truck east european car or sleek mercedes 
commuters descend into chandeliered stations to take the subway 
or patiently line up at bus stops pedestrians at major 
intersections use underpasses beneath the broad streets despite the 
dearth of traffic 
men in green military overcoats are visible on nearly every 
street although some carry briefcases and appear heading to work 
one carefully eyed a foreigner who bought a newspaper at a kiosk in 
the capital while another blocked a tourist from taking a picture of 
a dirty child at the border town of sinuiju 
the streets of pyongyang are deserted at night with only a dim 
glow coming from street lamps and apartments all revolutionary 
monuments and statues however are bathed in lights 
socialist realism is the art style prime examples include a 
heroic statue of a table tennis player and an indoor mural of 
victorious communist forces bloodied but not vanquished smashing 
the us army which is reviled because it came to the aid of south 
korea in the korean war and since 
a twohour acrobatic performance viewed by a group of tourists 
included a skit about the downfall of a us military policeman who 
was a caricature with blond hair crooked nose and slightly hunched 
back 
a north korean farmer got the best of the us soldier by 
tricking him into pulling a snake from a straw basket the snake bit 
the soldier until he fell unconcious placed on the fallen gis back 
was the slogan american soldiers go home

law enforcement agencies trumpet their seizure 
of more than 800 pounds of heroin calling it the largest drug 
confiscation ever in the united states but officials say that and 
other similar seizures dont mean theyre winning the war against 
drugs 
every year the government set records in the amount of drugs 
confiscated but seizures make just a dent in whats coming into 
the country or being produced here says drug enforcement 
administration spokesman maurice hill 
theres more of it now than there was three years ago no 
matter how much is being seized says cornelius dougherty another 
dea spokesman 
they say drugs lost to government raids are seen by drug dealers 
as a mere cost of doing business 
historically a manager of drug couriers gives up one courier 
who is body carrying drugs to take your attention away from four 
more said bill norsworthy a dea agent at the el paso 
intelligence center in texas 
people walk away from a brand new aircraft after one load and 
consider that an expense of the trip he said the same goes for 
boats automobiles campers they expect to pay a price 
law enforcement agencies repeatedly seize millions of dollars in 
drug profits that go unclaimed because to claim it would mean 
proving ownership and thus where the money came from hill says 
a better way to assess how the united states is doing in the war 
on drugs is to concentrate on the price and purity level of the 
drugs on the street says sen joseph r biden jr ddel 
for too long when weve asked whether or not our drug strategy 
is working the administration has cited record arrest and seizure 
data said biden the senate judiciary committee chairman 
a check of price and purity of drugs on the streets biden said 
shows cocaine and heroin on the streets are much cheaper and more 
potent than they were five years ago 
in 1982 cocaine sold at the retail level at a range nationwide 
of 2000 to 3000 per ounce and was 50 percent to 60 percent pure 
dougherty said 
in 1988 the street price of cocaine had dropped to 500 to 
2000 per ounce and it was 80 percent pure said dougherty citing 
information from drug seizures undercover drug buys intelligence 
and records seized 
in 1985 a gram of heroin at 53 percent purity could be bought 
on the street for a minimum of 115 he said by 1988 the cost of a 
gram at 6 percent to 8 percent purity was as low as 90 
drug busts gain a certain public popularity in part because there 
are very few solid numbers about anything involving the war on 
drugs such as the level of illegal drugs in america 
its a quagmire said coast guard lt cmdr jim simpson of 
attempts to calculate the total amount of drugs confiscated if 
you add them up youll find the government got 10 times what it 
actually seized everyones trying to make themselves look 
good 
simpson invented a scenario in which the dea provides the 
intelligence an air force radar locates the ship a navy jet spots 
the ship the coast guard tracks it and the final seizure is 
conducted by a local sheriff in florida 
even if everyone was trying to do the right thing and no one 
was trying to cheat it would still be a nightmare to sort out 
various claims over the seizure even though the agencies attempt to 
note when they have assisted and when they have made a seizure 
alone he said

half the americans in a national poll believe a 
serious accident is likely at a us nuclear power plant despite 
safeguards put in place since the three mile island accident a 
decade ago 
fiftyfive percent of the respondents in the media 
generalassociated press survey supported the use of nuclear power 
to generate electricity but eight in 10 favored tougher federal 
safety regulations and most opposed building new plants 
most also opposed starting up completed nuclear power plants that 
are not yet running and while 48 percent said currently operating 
plants should stay open 44 percent said they should be either 
phased out or shut down at once 
the national survey of 1162 adults had a margin of error of plus 
or minus 3 percent it was conducted jan 412 in advance of the 
10th anniversary of the accident march 28 1979 at the three mile 
island plant in middletown pa 
tighter federal regulation of the nuclear power industry resulted 
from the tmi accident which destroyed one of the plants two 
reactors 
in the survey 63 percent said they believed nuclear power plants 
are safer now 
however when asked to rate the chance of a serious accident at a 
nuclear power plant in the united states 11 percent chose highly 
likely and 39 percent said likely for a total of 50 percent 
thirty percent said a serious accident was unlikely and 14 percent 
said highly unlikely for a total of 44 percent the remaining 6 
percent had no opinion 
an overwhelming 79 percent said the federal government should be 
tougher in enforcing safety rules and 62 percent said governors 
should have the power to shut down nuclear power plants in their 
states 
regulation aside 56 percent said they believe it is impossible 
to safely store longterm radioactive waste from nuclear power 
plants just 27 percent called safe storage possible and 18 percent 
werent sure 
support for nuclear power was markedly higher among men and 
republicans twothirds of those groups supported nuclear power 
generally compared with half the democrats and independents and 
just 45 percent of the women polled 
six in 10 women and as many democrats said an accident was 
likely compared with four in 10 of the men and the republicans 
while 58 percent of the respondents with high school educations 
feared an accident that fell to 37 percent of those with 
postgraduate schooling 
only a third overall said more nuclear power plants should be 
built in the united states of those who favored more plants 
threequarters said they would accept one within 10 miles of their 
home no new nuclear power plant construction permits have been 
issued since 1979 
just two in 10 said nuclear power plants that have been completed 
but not yet licensed should be allowed to open such plants in 
seabrook nh and shoreham ny have been stalled in part by 
opposition from the governor in new york and in seabrooks case 
the governor of neighboring massachusetts 
six in 10 said governors should have the authority to prevent a 
nuclear plant from opening in their states and as many said 
governors should be able to shut down operating plants governors do 
not have such power now 
fortyeight percent said the nations 108 fully operating 
commercial nuclear power plants should continue to operate 35 
percent said they should be phased out gradually 9 percent said 
they should be closed immediately and 8 percent had no opinion 
of those who wanted the plants phased out a third wanted it done 
within five years about a third within 10 years and the rest would 
allow longer

one of the countrys leading 
industrialists said monday that apartheid has made south africa 
stink and urged the government to draft a longterm plan for 
reform 
harry oppenheimer 80yearold former chairman of the anglo 
american corp mining conglomerate said in a speech the government 
must abandon its cautious piecemeal approach to reform and stop 
trying to appease rightwing whites 
he said foreign countries would respond favorably to a bold 
commitment to consistent longrange reform 
disagreeable though it may be we must admit that the racial 
policy which has been pursued here over the last 40 years has made 
south africa stink in the nostrils of decent humane people around 
the world he said 
oppenheimer said south africas disenfranchised black majority 
will reject the free enterprise system unless they are enabled to 
share to the full in the great benefits it can bring that is 
certainly not the case today 
the immediate need therefore is to open the economy in a fair 
and equal way to all south africans he said that calls 
amongst other things for the repeal of the group areas act which 
mandates racial segregation of residential areas 
in other developments monday 
lawyers and civil rights workers said about 80 detainees have 
been released in the 10 days since law and order minister adriaan 
vlok held negotiations to resolve a widespread hunger strike vlok 
told antiapartheid clergymen that a substantial number of the

two weeks 
four hunger strikers who had been admitted to johannesburg 
hospital were released monday but they told reporters they had been 
placed under restrictions barring them from political activity and 
requiring them to be in their homes at night 
most of the more than 300 hunger strikers suspended their fast 
pending an assessment of the governments response but lawyers say 
some detainees in natal province are continuing the strike 
demanding to be freed or charged

prime minister yitzhak shamir billed tuesdays 
nationwide municipal elections as a referendum on the arabisraeli 
conflict saying gains for his rightwing likud bloc would show the 
world israel will never talk to the plo 
every vote for likud means that israel wants no truck with the 
murderers of our sons who want to destroy israel shamir was 
quoted as saying monday by the jerusalem post 
but leaders of the leftleaning labor party rejected shamirs 
claim saying local not national issues are at stake and that the 
personalities of the candidates take precedent over ideology 
its completely off the subject we will focus on the issues 
that count daytoday municipal issues said daniel eldar 
labors campaign manager 
two issues that played a role in the november general elections 
probably will spill over into the municipal voting the 
religioussecular conflict and the nearly 15monthold palestinian 
uprising against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
propalestine liberation organization underground leaders of the 
uprising have urged the about 70000 arab voters in east jerusalem 
to boycott the elections and called a general strike for tuesday to 
enforce the order 
at the same time the army ordered the occupied lands sealed from 
midnight monday to 10 pm tuesday barring west bank and gaza 
residents from entering israel 
political analysts meanwhile predicted gains for the religious 
parties similar to those in the november elections in that vote 
relivious parties increased their representation from 14 to 18 seats 
in the 120member parliament alarming many secular israelis 
about 27 million israelis of them 400000 arabs are eligible 
to vote in 147 municipalities choosing mayors and 1341 council 
members there are 99 municipalities in the jewish sector and 48 in 
the arab sector 
in the 1983 elections 55 percent of the voters cast ballots and 
election officials expect a similar turnout this year in the last 
general elections turnout was nearly 80 percent 
in 1983 labor won in 54 municipalities compared with 26 towns 
ruled by likud the remainder of the towns are run by local 
political groups or religious parties 
each voter casts two ballots one for mayor and one for a party 
slate parties are awarded seats in the city council according to 
the number of votes won 
key contests are in the three largest cities jerusalem tel aviv 
and haifa 
in jerusalem mayor teddy kollek is assured reelection to a 
sixth term but his laboraffiliated one jerusalem list might 
lose control of the 31member city council because of the arab 
boycott and the growing strength of the religious parties 
working with a hostile council might force kollek to make 
concessions to rightwing and religious parties thus further 
escalating the arabisraeli and religioussecular conflicts dividing 
the city 
in tel aviv the only major city run by likud popular mayor 
shlomo lahat is likely to win a fourth term lahat says he has 
turned tel aviv into an international metropolis and promised 
secular voters to keep the city free from religious coercion 
the religious parties insist on closing entertainment spots 
including restaurants and movie theaters on the jewish sabbath the 
biblically mandated day of rest that lasts from sundown friday to 
sundown saturday 
haifa a stronghold of the left for decades has become a major 
battleground for the two big parties 
we have red flags all over the country and we would like to 
paint some of them blue the color of likud said likuds 
campaign organizer nimrod granit 
taking haifa would be like taking stalingrad granit said 
referring to the soviet city in which the red army successfully 
withstood a german offensive during world war ii

prime minister sadek mahdi said monday he 
will resign in a week unless the army promises not to overthrow him 
and leaders of trade and professional unions pledge not to strike 
price riots and general strikes nearly four years ago prompted 
the army to oust president gaafar nimeiri who had ruled sudan for 
16 years mahdis civilian government was elected a year later 
mahdis comments were made in a speech to parliament on monday 
the deadline the military gave him a week ago for choosing a new 
cabinet and trying to end the 6yearold civil war in southern sudan 
army officials did not say what they would do if mahdi did not 
meet their conditions and had no immediate reaction to his speech 
but sources in the military said privately the high command was 
assessing it 
on their clandestine radio station the rebels claimed to have 
captured torit a strategic garrison town in equatoria province that 
had been under siege for months 
mahdi told parliament the army ultimatum did not threaten a coup 
then demanded assurances there would not be one after the ultimatum 
was issued feb 20 a military spokesman said he would not describe 
it as a coup threat

khalil resigned

peace agreement proposed in november by the democratic unionist 
party which was part of the government coalition at the time and 
the rebel sudan peoples liberation army 
after mahdi refused to submit the plan to the cabinet or 
parliament the unionists left the government

the soviet union exported about 515 million 
worth of military equipment to nicaragua last year the second 
highest total since the kremlin began weapons deliveries in 1980 
according to a new us government report 
the report says last years delivery of 19000 tons of equipment 
came during 68 ship visits to nicaraguan ports an average of about 
one every six days 
the unclassified analysis compiled by intelligence agencies 
said the peak year for soviet arms shipments was 1986 when the 
sandinistas received 550 million worth of equipment 
that was the last year congress approved military aid for the 
nicaraguan contras 
a year ago congress suspended military aid to the contras and 
as the months passed reagan administration officials expressed deep 
disappointment that the soviets did not reciprocate by cutting back 
on weapons shipments to the sandinistas 
the aid suspension was quickly followed by an interim ceasefire 
between the sandinistas and the contras in late march subsequently 
about 11000 contras fled to camps in honduras along the border 
where the rebels are sustained by a us humanitarian aid program 
the sandinistas have contended that continued soviet arms 
shipments were needed in the event the united states decided to 
resume military aid to the contras 
the kremlin has said that it would suspend arms deliveries to the 
sandinistas as part of an overall ban on outside arms shipments to 
central america but the united states has shown no interest in that 
proposal 
the 515 million listed for 1988 is described in the report as a 
preliminary estimate which is subject to revision as new data become 
available us officials have estimated soviet economic aid to 
nicaragua at about 500 million annually 
a us official who asked not to be identified said estimates 
of military aid were somewhat easier to make last year because a 
lack of storage space forced the sandinistas to leave much of the 
equipment out in the open where it could be photographed by us 
intelligence agencies 
the united states and the soviet union have shown an ability to 
work together on several regional conflicts including afghanistan 
angolanamibia and the iraniraq war 
but the superpowers remain deeply divided over nicaragua the 
united states looks on the continuing soviet arms deliveries as the 
most troubling aspect of soviet involvement in that area 
former assistant secretary of state elliott abrams said last 
month before leaving office that economic decline in nicaragua has 
left the sandinista government somewhat weaker but that the weapons 
deliveries have made it stronger militarily 
the report said that the sandinista army including active duty 
and mobilized militiareserves totaled 80000 at the start of 
1989 the same figure as a year earlier 
the sandinista inventory also included 150 tanks 250 other 
armored vehicles 32 fixedwing aircraft 50 helicopters and six 
airfields the report said 
the type of equipment received by the sandinistas in 1988 was not 
specified in the report

for a time monday the most pressing 
question for some of the highest officials of the us government 
was which ones are my shoes 
the top poohbahs of the bush white house had to leave their shoes 
at the door when they lunched in the pleasant wooden surroundings of 
the ever spring house on the grounds of the blue house the 
fortified residence of korean presidents 
thats korean tradition no problem 
but when lunch was over there they were in a neat row the nine 
pairs of nearly identical black slipon shoes that clearly are 
favored by the upper crust of the bush team 
which were secretary of state james bakers and which were chief 
of staff john sununus which belonged to brent scowcroft the 
temporarily shoeless national security adviser and which to gaston 
sigur the assistant secretary of state 
with all the dignity they could command they stood on the porch 
of the ever spring house longhandled shoehorns in hand figuring 
out which shoes belonged to which feet 
they did it and were shod in time for the formal ceremony ending 
bushs talk and lunch with president roh taewoo the former 
fourstar general who is bushs korean counterpart 
bush had no problem with his shoes the presidential shoes were 
the only ones of the american party that were laced traditional 
black wingtips 
it didnt even matter hoever since a korean aide whisked bushs 
shoes inside at the last minute sparing the president the need to 
put them on in public 
if shoes were a problem so were legs at lunch the ever spring 
house is a handsome korean building of 52 red pine pillars and the 
meal served inside was equally traditional including the sitting 
arrangements 
sitting was on seats that lack legs the president who stands 
6feet2 did not know quite where to put his feet that lacked shoes 
so he asked his host roh do you put your legs straight out or 
do you fold them up the president of korea showed the president 
of the united states how to fit his long legs under the low table 
bush was in korea for a friendship stop on the way home from his 
trip to the funeral of emperor hirohito of japan and his visit to 
china 
he talked and lunched with roh pumpkin porridge three kinds of 
fish sliced marinated beef dumpling soup rice cakes and 
milkywhite korean rice wine but mostly he posed for pictures duing 
his korean visit of less than five hours 
he posed at the airport where koreans waving paper flags held up 
signs reading great regard for george bush 
he posed with roh upon arriving at the blue house and with rohs 
wife and when he signed the guest book he posed during the talks 
photographers being allowed in in relays assembly line fashion 
he posed before lunch in the ever spring house with his shoes 
off the photographers were equally unshod 
he posed after lunch with roh after both declared their talks a 
great success in remarks written before the session started 
at the national assembly bush posed with the assembly speaker 
and the speakers wife just a few more pictures at the airport with 
members of the american community and bush was ready to head home 
bush went by helicopter everywhere he traveled in seoul parts of 
the city including near the us embassy and the university saw 
ugly policedemonstrator clashes but the airborne bush never laid 
eyes on an angry korean

the governors of michigan iowa ohio 
missouri minnesota wisconsin and indiana agreed monday to share 
the cost of a lowlevel nuclear waste site said gov james 
blanchard of michigan 
in january blanchard had halted site selection in michigan until 
the other states in the midwest interstate lowlevel radioactive 
waste compact met demands designed to ensure michigan bore only its 
fair share of the financial burden 
he ordered the siteselection process to resume after the states 
agreed to his terms 
no one wants to be left holding the bag with the lowlevel 
waste issue blanchard said in announcing the agreement 
blanchard and the governors of iowa ohio missouri minnesota 
wisconsin and indiana reached agreement on the waste site monday 
after two days of conferences during the national governors 
association winter meeting 
we support the party states sharing reponsibility and liability 
for those expenses not paid for by insurance or the funds 
established in michigan statute and that share be based on a 
prorated amount according to the amount of waste generated in each 
state the governors said in a joint letter to blanchard 
the governors also agreed that each state would continue to pay 
its share of the disposal sites operation even if the state 
withdraws from the midwest compact 
the disposal plant would cost an estimated 300 million over its 
20year life said jd snyder blanchards aide dealing with 
environmental issues 
with the agrement michigans share could be less than onethird 
of that amount snyder said 
had the other states failed to agree to blanchards terms 
michigan would have had to pay the full cost of building and 
operating the plant 
the state legislatures would need to approve spending on the 
site blanchard said adding he foresaw no difficulty in obtaining 
the funding 
michigan was selected as the site for the nuclear waste dump 
because it generates the most radioactive waste in the region 
michigan generated about 27000 cubic feet of lowlevel 
radioactive waste last year from nuclear plants research 
institutions and hospitals 
michigans nuclear waste now goes to sites in south carolina and 
washington whose governors threatened to refuse to accept michigan 
waste unless blanchard rescinded his order halting site selection

swedish students are getting a distorted 
view of the united states in their schoolbooks us ambassador 
gregory newell said monday 
newell who is leaving stockholm in june after three years as 
ambassador said the american view of sweden as a permissive and 
socialistic country also was inaccurate and the two countries 
should get to know each other better 
newells complaint was based on a study of about 50 history books 
and other texts for the swedish equivalent of high school and junior 
high the results of the review were reported to washington us 
officials said 
many of the books were outdated and written in a period when 
sweden was outspokenly critical of the us involvement in the 
vietnam war 
in one book the few sentences about vietnam included the fact 
that us planes dropped more bombs there than fell in world war ii 
said an embassy official who spoke on condition he was not 
identified 
newer books also gave too much stress to racial problems poverty 
and homelessness the official said 
newell speaking on swedish radio cited a series of texts he saw 
three years ago titled reagans america 
the picture and the facts were accurate but they werent full 
they talked about poverty levels they talked about compassion 
lacking and the underprivileged of reagans america he said 
they made no mention of the creation of new jobs and the 
reduction of inflation he said those sorts of things we dont 
see treated in a balanced way that is our concern newell added

week in vienna with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
baker also will hold separate talks with the foreign ministers of 
the north atlantic treaty organization and participate in ceremonies 
marking the opening of new eastwest arms control negotiations the 
state department announced monday 
the negotiations concern concentrations of nato and warsaw pact 
ground forces and tanks in europe the goal is to reduce them as a 
means of easing eastwest tensions 
spokesman charles e redman said baker would leave washington for 
the austrian capital on saturday and return on march 7 the 
negotiations will open march 9 under a broad agreement between the 
united states and the soviet union reached last year to supersede 15 
years of futile discussions 
the talks that failed dealt with central europe the new 
negotiations will cover the vast expanse of the continent from the 
ural mountains in the soviet union to the atlantic ocean 
bakers meeting with shevardnadze was described by redman as a 
getacquainted session the soviet foreign minister has just 
completed a trip to the middle east in which he offered a resumption 
of relations to israel if it would negotiate with the palestine 
liberation organization and has been to tehran 
shevardnadze spoke to the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the 
spiritual leader of iran who proposed closer ties to the soviet 
union to counter what the fundamentalist cleric called devilish 
acts of the west 
redman confirmed the middle east and iran were on bakers agenda 
for the shevardnadze meeting 
the bush administration is in the midst of reviewing us policy 
toward the soviet union and the middle east president bush said 
last week he foresaw only a limited role for the soviets in the 
region and that he would not be stampeded into taking decisions 
as a result of the soviet initiative 
baker is due to report to the nato foreign ministers meanwhile 
on how he views prospects for arabisraeli diplomacy several of 
them urged him during a trip to western europe earlier this month to 
take advantage of what they considered to be palestinian moderation 
baker remarked at the time that one has to till the ground 
carefully one has to proceed cautiously and understand that if you 
push the level of discussion too high too soon and create too much 
international attention you might preempt opportunities

former mayor mike boyle ousted in a 1987 
recall election announced today that he will run again for the 
citys top job 
in announcing his candidacy boyle said he decided to run because 
he loves politics and public service and because a surprisingly 
large number of people urged him to enter the race 
i believe i have learned much from the mistakes that i made 
when i was mayor that i have grown from those experiences and that 
i could provide seasoned and thoughtful leadership for the people of 
omaha boyle said 
among boyles opponents in the nonpartisan primary is city 
councilman jim cleary who gained prominence as leader of the boyle 
recall movement in 1987 and later was elected to the city council 
the primary is set for april 4 the general election for may 9 
boyle 45 was elected mayor in 1981 and reelected in 1985 but 
opponents began gathering petition signatures shortly after his 
second term started 
they accused boyle of abusing his power meddling in police 
affairs being soft on drunken driving and being disrespectful 
citing an incident in which he allegedly threw pats of butter during 
a dinnertable argument 
on jan 13 1987 boyle became the first mayor in omahas history 
to be recalled with 56 percent of voters supporting the recall and 
44 percent in favor or retaining boyle 
boyle returned to a private law practice after the recall 
both boyle and cleary said the recall will not be an issue in the 
mayoral race 
its been over two years i dont think people want the recall 
revisited boyle said sunday before officially announcing his 
candidacy 
also in the mayoral race are mayor walter calinger city council 
president fred conley former douglas county commissioner steve

its a likely combination for a book of memoirs 
the editor one of the most powerful in us publishing also writes 
potboilers and has hollywood connections the author former 
president ronald reagan is a powerbroker with a b movie past 
michael korda son of film art director vincent korda certainly 
knows about power he is editorinchief at simon amp schuster has 
written bestselling tomes including queenie and the howto 
power and has been editor for presidents and novelists 
as korda 55 prepares to work on reagans memoirs his own 
easytodigest novel the fortune about the shenanigans of a 
powerful and rich family is appearing in bookstores 
it can be argued i like to write about subjects that are flashy 
and glamorous so does jackie collins korda said during a 
recent stop here on a promotional tour 
i guess im interested in the penalties that come with having 
too much says korda 
korda has worked with a varied group of authors that includes 
graham greene harold robbins anthony burgess edward koch charles 
degaulle richard nixon henry kissinger jimmy carter tennessee 
williams and the collins sisters jackie and joan 
he has always moved easily in conservative circles although he is 
a democrat 
im a kennedy democrat an old kennedy not the new one he 
said distinguishing between the late president and his brother 
sen edward m kennedy 
its too early to talk about what the reagan book will be like 
korda said no publication date has been set 
i cant tell you whats going to be in the book he said 
but there are millions and millions of americans who voted for him 
twice who regard him as a great american hero forget whether you 
agree with him or not 
korda said he knows little of reagans writing plans even 
whether the book will be composed on legal pad or computer terminal 
he quotes reagans public statement that he wont employ a 
ghostwriter 
korda refuses to disclose the size of the deal with reagan 
saying thats the authors prerogative before the contract was 
announced jan 25 a literary agent guessed the book would bring 
more than 5 million 
however reagan delivers his version of his life korda says any 
book by the bestselling president is sure to be a bestseller too 
reagan is no stranger to simon amp schuster the publisher wanted a 
book by reagan even before he ran for governor of california korda 
said the subject then was to be reagans account of his time 
heading the screen actors guild during the 1950s era of mccarthyism 
kordas editing technique is discreet and sideways he wont tell 
the memoirist what to include but he might nudge a little 
then there are kordas own ventures as an author the novel 
queenie based on the life of his actress aunt the late merle 
oberon and a memoir charmed lives 
hes also written howtos including male chauvinism how it 
works and power how to get it how to use it 
those books responded to a time when people were most interested 
in taking and using power he said they preceded the excesses of 
the nixon administration larger numbers of women in the workforce 
and the polarized wealth that resulted in more millionaires and more 
havenots he said 
today people are much more interested in money domestic life 
in happiness in having a fulfilled and complete life korda said 
thus his new book the fortune concerns a family of 
billionaires fighting over sex and money 
for eight years weve had relative prosperity at least for 
middleclass white people youve got a country on the whole 
thats not interested in civil rights even jesse jackson doesnt 
refer to the civil rights movement anymore weve written off the 
poor as a matter of interest

the economy will slow substantially in 1989 
with rising inflation and higher interest rates likely to topple the 
country into a recession before the end of next year the nations 
top business economists predicted monday 
the national association of business economists said a survey of 
its members found them slightly more optimistic about growth 
prospects for this year than they were three months ago 
but by lopsided numbers the economists were still predicting 
that the most likely date for the start of the next recession was 
1990 
three out of four of the economists surveyed expected a new 
recession sometime in the next two years however the number 
predicting a downturn in 1989 dropped from 40 percent to 19 percent 
in the latest survey 
jay woodworth president of the association said that economists 
were more optimistic about 1989 in part because of signs that auto 
sales retail spending and housing construction were holding up even 
with the increase in interest rates 
the business economists feel that this expansion is not at the 
end of its string yet we probably have another year or so to go 
woodworth senior domestic economist at bankers trust co of new 
york said at a news briefing 
the new survey was taken before the latest round of 
credittightening on the part of the federal reserve board last 
friday the fed boosted its discount rate the interest it charges 
to make loans to financial institions to 7 percent a hike in the 
discount rate is the most dramatic signal the central bank can send 
of its intentions to push interest rates higher to dampen an 
overheated economy 
the business economists expressed strong support for the feds 
inflationfighting battle with 70 percent expecting the board to 
boost interest rates further in the next six months 
woodward said the inflationary pressures if they do not start 
receding would likely take their toll on the expansion which has 
already lasted a peacetime record of six years 
inflation rates of 5 percent to 525 percent are too high to be 
consistent with longterm growth and over time they would send the 
economy into a recession he said 
the median forecast for growth this year as measured by the 
gross national product was 27 percent up slightly from a 25 
percent estimate made by the business economists three months ago 
the economy grew at a fouryear high of 38 percent last year 
the bush administration has based its first budget on an estimate 
that the economy will slow only modestly in 1989 to a growth rate of 
32 percent but this estimate is about onehalf percentage point 
higher than most private forecasters 
the administration is counting on faster growth to bring in more 
revenues and help it lower the budget deficit without resorting to 
higher taxes 
on the question of interest rates the business economists see 
shortterm rates hitting a peak of 85 percent this year and then 
beginning to decline to 78 percent by the end of 1989 
the administration is forecasting substantially lower rates for 
this year a projection that also makes the deficit look smaller on 
paper because it lowers government borrowing costs 
on other topics the business economists said 
unemployment will show little change this year because of the 
generally sluggish outlook for growth the jobless rate should 
average 55 percent for the whole year up slightly from the 54 
percent unemployment rate recorded in january 
inflation will worsen this year with consumer prices climbing by 
48 percent compared to increases of 44 percent in both 1987 and 
1988 
the merchandise trade deficit whicllion last year will continue 
improving but at a slower rate 
in 1989 falling by 12 percent to 120 billion 
the business economists generally supported bushs stand that the 
budget deficit should be reduced primarily by cutting government 
spending only 15 percent of those surveyed said they believed tax 
increases should be emphasized over spending cuts although a larger 
group said they would be willing to accept a package of tax 
increases and spending cuts 
a large majority of economists 72 percent singled out 
reductions in farm subsidies as the most fruitful place to look for 
savings followed by cuts in military spending favored by 55 
percent and reductions in costofliving increases fosupported by 47 percent 
of those surveyed 
on the tax side 71 percent of economists said they would favor 
an increase in the gasoline tax followed by 51 percent who said 
government user fees should be raised 
the economic projections were based on a survey of 69 economists 
who make up the associations economic forecasting panel the 
assessments of budgetary and monetary policy came from a broader 
survey of nearly 300 of the associations members

organizers hope an exhibition opening 
wednesday of 26 centuries of chinese art will propel this central 
ohio city into the cultural major leagues 
its a major statement showing that columbus can back its 
cultural exhibitions said dorothy brownley who helped raise more 
than 33 million for the exhibit titled son of heaven imperial 
arts of china 
the display of 225 pieces of chinese art and artifacts dating to 
the 4th century bc runs through sept 4 
some say the fanfare surrounding the show could generate support 
for other largescale art exhibitions 
this city is entering into a larger arena for the arts said 
merribell parsons the exhibits director and head of the columbus 
museum of art 
the show features objects from the palaces of 2600 years of 
chinese emperors and kings they were lent mostly by museums in 
beijing and eight chinese provinces 
included are lifesized terracotta horses and warrior sculptures 
from the tomb of chinas first emperor 2500yearold cooking 
vessels and temple bells delicate scroll paintings from the 15th 
century and a 2ndcentury jade burial suit 
some of the items were found in recent archeological digs in 
china ms parsons said 
son of heaven was chinas term for its emperors believed to 
be the human link to heaven 
its a very very important record of chinese cultural history 
and its art washington university art professor robert thorp said 
recently thorp helped lead the collaboration of the chinese 
government and a us organizing committee that created the exhibit 
the importance of son of heaven hasnt been lost on columbus 
more than a week before the opening about 85000 tickets had 
been sold at 450 to 1250 said exhibit spokeswoman pat cramer 
columbus schoolchildren were learning ancient chinese history to 
prepare for field trips and ohio state university added a series of 
son of heaven lectures to its continuing education curriculum 
a downtown department store since last fall has devoted a section 
of its first floor to son of heaven sweatshirts tshirts and 
mugs 
an empty downtown school was loaned by the city and converted for 
the show into a fivegallery 40000squarefoot exhibition hall it 
even contains a cafeteria for visitors and a hospitality suite for 
donors 
not that the arts generally go ignored in columbus a city of 
slightly more than half a million that supports a professional 
orchestra ballet company opera company and theater troupe 
but this exhibition has been compared to the treasures of 
tutankhamun the ancient egyptian collection that drew millions of 
vistors during a us tour that included chicago more than a decade 
ago 
the success of tut may have helped generate support for 
later major exhibits in chicago including a display of pompeiian 
art at the art institute and another egyptian show that opened at 
the field museum of chicago last november said that museums 
egyptian consultant frank yurco 
the field museum sold 47000 new memberships during tuts 
fourmonth stay there in 1977 said spokewoman barbara scott 
organizers in columbus hope to capitalize on a similar wave of 
public interest to draw at least 500000 visitors to son of 
heaven proceeds must meet an estimated 635 million in expenses 
they say 
about 500000 people saw son of heaven last year in seattle 
the shows only other stop in the united states 
as for future projects in columbus who knows 
the columbus museum of art is toying with the idea of trying to 
raise 60 million to 80 million for an expansion by the year 2000 
its possible ms parsons said after this exhibit i 
really think its possible

the state department said monday the peace plan 
offered by salvadoran president jose napoleon duarte represents 
the most significant opportunity ever for a settlement to that 
countrys nineyearold conflict 
department spokesman charles redman spoke after duarte accepted 
on sunday a proposal by the fmln rebel group for direct talks and 
said negotiations should begin tuesday accompanied by a threemonth 
ceasefire 
in our judgment this is potentially the most significant 
opportunity ever for peace in el salvador particularly the 
commitment of the government of el salvador to undertake a cessation 
of hostilities if the fmln agrees within 48 hours redman said 
he called on the fmln to follow the governments example and 
immediately stop the killing so that the political process can 
move forward 
the time has come for the fmln to choose between terrorist 
violence and democratic balloting he said 
redman added that us officials had consulted with salvadoran 
officials about the proposal but that the plan was not imposed on 
the salvadorans 
in a nationwide television and radio speech sunday night duarte 
also addressed the guerrillas offer to participate in and accept 
the results of the presidential election if it is postponed for at 
least four months 
he advocated postponing the vote which is scheduled for march 
19 until april 30 and proposed that a referendum be held on the 
issue if the government and rebels cannot resolve it in talks 
there have been no direct talks between the government and the 
guerrillas since october 1987 duarte proposed that the talks be 
held in guatemala

the judge in oliver l norths irancontra 
trial abruptly adjourned the proceedings today during a dispute over 
the use of classified information during cross examination of 
witness robert w owen 
us district judge gerhard gesell sent the jury home for the 
rest of the day and cleared the courtroom to hold a closed hearing 
on the classified information at issue 
the adjournment came after a heated bench conference during which 
the judge was overheard telling prosecutors my ruling is the name 
must come in indicating the dispute involved disclosing the name 
of a secret source 
the dispute arose as owen who was norths courier to central 
america was being questioned about a 1985 trip he took to costa 
rica to view the site of an airfield for rebel resupply operations 
ladies and gentlemen a clearly angry gesell told jurors i 
am going to excuse you for the day and try to get this roadblock 
straightened out 
the dispute arose before the noon lunch break when defense 
attorney brendan v sullivan jr proposed introducing a document 
into evidence as part of his crossexamination of owen 
the judge asked to see the document over the lunch hour when the 
trial reconvened gesell apparently ruled during a bench conference 
that the information was relevant to the case prompting a halfhour 
recess while prosecutors consulted with government security experts 
another bench conference ensued when court reconvened after the 
recess gesell spoke to prosecutor john w keker so angrily that his 
voice could be heard at times in the rear of the courtroom 
i have offered you an opportunity to withdraw the witness 
the judge was overheard telling keker 
later he told keker i am willing to try to help you get a 
stipulation to facts that would be brought out in defense 
crossexamination 
earlier in the day owen said that as congress was cutting off 
aid to the contras north called himself the reagan administrations 
point man for helping the nicaraguan rebels and its fall guy 
if things went awry 
north said he was to be in essence the point man said 
robert w owen who ferried intelligence reports tacital advice and 
money from the white house aide to the contras 
the conversation occurred in the spring of 1984 when congress 
banned military aid to the contras owen said 
he was to be the one responsible for keeping the nicaraguan 
resistance alive owen told jurors as the second week of testimony 
in norths trial got under way in us district court 
north told him he was going to be the one to take 
responsibility in essence to protect those who were higher than he 
in the government owen said under questioning by defense attorney 
brendan v sullivan jr 
owen quoted north as saying the scenario had been arranged and 
okd through my superiors in the government and i believe he said 
bill casey the late cia director 
north a retired marine lieutenant colonel and former national 
security council aide faces 12 felony charges stemming from his 
involvement in the irancontra affair 
the charges which carry a maximum penalty of 60 years 
imprisonment upon conviction include allegations that north lied to 
congress about his covert support of the rebels when such aid was 
banned by the socalled boland amendments first enacted in 1984 
to blunt charges that norths conduct was illegal the defense is 
trying to show that he acted at all times with the express authority 
of top administration officials including president reagan 
owen said that throughout their twoyear association north would 
often consult with casey he said that during visits to the old 
executive office building he would on occasion see casey emerge 
from norths office as he was going in 
north would talk on the telephone with casey and other cia 
officials while he was in the office owen said 
my name was never mentioned but there were discussions about 
what he was doing owen said these discussions with cia officials 
included obtaining intelligence maps and the possible reassignment 
of someone involved in the resistance movement he added 
owen said the maps he carried to the contra rebels came from 
across the river the euphemism used by washington officials 
for the cia 
owen said he made an agreement with independent counsel lawrence 
e walsh to cooperate with the investigation and receive immunity 
from prosecution even though he didnt think he had broken any laws 
helping the contras 
i wouldnt suggest i intended to be a witness in this case but 
i certainly signed the agreement owen said expressing his 
support for north

hungary accused its warsaw pact ally romania of 
grave human rights violations and said monday it will join western 
countries calling for the united nations to investigate the 
situation 
it is believed to be the first time a communist country urges the 
world body to investigate alleged abuses in another east bloc state 
we are concerned that human rights and fundamental freedoms 
are in our judgment gravely violated in romania and this judgment 
is shared by many other countries hungarian deputy foreign 
minister gyula horn told the un human rights commission 
we are convinced that meeting the requirement of respect for 
human rights is irrespective of a countrys belonging to a system of 
alliance and its social system he told the 43nation commission 
hungarys proposals to deal with the problem bilaterally with 
romania had brought no results so the country is ready to 
cosponsor a resolution initiated by sweden that urges the united 
nations to appoint a special investigator into romanias human 
rights situation horn said 
he cited alleged violations ranging from the demolition of 
villages and destruction of cultural and historic values to forced 
assimilation of minorities and curbs on religious freedom 
at a news conference after his address horn said hungary did not 
consult the soviet union or its other communist allies before making 
its decision 
in december hungary became the first communist country to ratify 
a key human rights protocol allowing citizens to address individual 
complaints of alleged rights violations to a un panel 
hungary also was the first communist state to decide friday to 
ratify a 1951 convention defining rights of refugees 
according to hungarian statistics about 15000 romanians have 
sought asylum in neighboring hungary most of them illegally 
crossing the border 
horn said 85 percent of refugees are ethnic hungarians although 
arrivals include members of german and other minorities as well as 
romanians 
some stretches of the 186mile border are virtually unguarded 
while guards are posted every 100 yards at other areas he said 
horn was asked about the fate of refugees who are caught 
there are some who never reappear he said they are those 
who are heavily beaten there are all kinds of punishments but he 
added he was not aware of any shooting 
in london british journalist sue lloydroberts said she and 
colleague vivian roberts were arrested four times for clandestinely 
photographing areas of romania allegedly wrecked by president 
nicolae ceausescus modernization plans 
she smuggled out her footage broadcast monday in britain by 
hiding it in her underwear the footage showed empty brickstrewn 
fields where three villages had stood until last fall 
ceausescu wants to create his communist man and he has to 
destroy the romanian village because thats where the opposition to 
communism is total said romanian emigre leader ion rativ the 
report said people spoke of villagers being killed resisting 
eviction 
the demolitions are part of ceausescus plan to raze 7000 of 
romanias 13000 villages and resettle people in socalled 
agroindustrial centers 
an unidentified woman was shown describing what happened they 
destroyed everyones home my house was knocked to the ground 
theyve made us live in new blocks everything is wretched and 
miserable what can be done

and dissidents throwing rocks and firebombs battled riot police

bush go home and down with military dictatorship 
protesters shouted as they began a march to the us embassy three 
miles away 
the protesters carrying red and blue flags tried to march into 
the streets after a rally on campus where they burned effigies of 
bush and south korean president roh taewoo marchers beating drums

bush in seoul for a brief visit on his way home from china and 
japan moved around the capital by helicopter and was not near the 
violence the government mobilized 20000 riot police in central 
seoul to block protests 
antiamericanism was a casual subject in the conversation between 
bush and roh before they started formal talks and bush asked why 
even a small number of korean students staged violent protests 
officials said 
roh replied there is a small group of radicals who subscribe to 
communist ideology and class struggle the officials said there 
also is a group of people who believe south korea is subservient to 
the united states they said 
in the southern city of kwangju hundreds of radicals fought with 
riot police firing tear gas clashes also were reported in kunsan

alliance called for the withdrawal of all us forces from south 
korea and charged that washington ruled the nation like a colony 
usa is the source of all suppression and sorrow to korean 
people since the division of the korean peninsula the letter said 
the letter accused the united states of dividing the korean 
peninsula and keeping troops in south korea to prevent its 
reunification with north korea it also denounced washington for 
seeking greater access for us imports to south korea 
radicals say rohs government is a military dictatorship 
controlled by the united states 
radical students have little public support because of their 
violent and extreme views but they can assemble thousands of 
activists and often clash with riot police

a priest who announced at mass that he would pay 
100 for every handgun turned in at his church said monday that 
calls are pouring in and he has four guns in hand already 
three of the four people who acted on sundays offer have turned 
down the 100 the rev marshall gourley added 
this is gourleys second effort to rid his flock of firearms 
last year he urged his parishioners at our lady of guadalupe church 
in north denver to turn in their handguns and had 12 takers from 
the parish of 1800 people 
this time he thought a financial incentive might make the 
program more successful 
one of the things people mentioned a year ago is that people 
had made a financial investment in their guns and asking them to 
simply give them up might be asking too much gourley said 
so he set aside more than 2000 donated to the church recently 
by a parishioner who had told him to use the money for something 
other than church repairs or the church budget 
it seemed maybe we could turn the money given to us for use as 
fertilizer and maybe have the tree produce more fruit he said 
gourley said his roman catholic parish has held about one funeral 
a month for gunshot victims over the past year but it was two 
recent funerals for a shooting victim and a suicide that 
prompted him to offer money for guns 
over the years gourleys parish also has sheltered central 
american refugees the homeless and victims of abuse 
anything that strikes at human dignity is something we try to 
address he said guns certainly meet that criterion the 
suffering they inflict on people certainly strikes at human dignity 
and the very value of life itself 
gourley made his pitch at four masses on sunday saying the holy 
spirit had moved him to offer money for guns 
some people were a little surprised he said not everyone 
was in agreement with our reaction to the whole menace of guns in 
our society but there are a great many people who are supportive 
too 
four handguns were turned in sunday with only one person 
accepting the 100 and from telephone calls in the last half 
hour three or four more are on the way gourley said 
gourley said the handguns will be turned over to police to be 
destroyed 
we have enough money now to buy 20 or 25 guns he said 
when we get to the point where we dont have any money well see 
if we can find money or go down to the mall and sing and dance and 
take up a collection 
i will ask for donations from gun shops and funeral homes they 
have been making a lot of money lately 
one parishioner asked gourley if people might not go out and 
dig up guns just to get the 100 
i said fine take advantage of me thats one less gun is a 
human life worth 100 are the bitter tears of a mother worth 
100

subway gunman bernhard goetzs last hope of 
cutting short his jail term ended monday when the supreme court 
upheld his gun possession conviction in the shooting of four 
teenagers on a subway 
it looks like this is the end of the line said mark baker 
goetzs cocounsel hopefully hell get early parole and thatll 
be the end of the criminal matter 
goetz 41 becomes eligible for parole sunday after serving 51 
days of a oneyear sentence stemming from the dec 22 1984 
shootings said ruby ryles of the correction department 
the supreme court without comment rejected arguments that goetz 
was denied a fair trial because a judge told jurors they must 
rather than may convict him if they found that the illegal 
possession charge had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt 
gerald mckelvey a spokesman for manhattan district attorney 
robert morgenthau said the prosecutor would not comment 
baker said he had spoken with goetz last week and goetz had 
anticipated the ruling would go against him 
goetz who also was fined 5000 began serving his sentence at 
rikers island on jan 13 and also spent time in prison upon his 
arrest 
supporters portrayed goetz as a hero while detractors labeled him 
a vigilante and a racist goetz is white the four teenagers he 
shot are black 
goetz was acquitted of attempted murder assault and reckless 
endangerment in 1987 and convicted on just a single weapons 
possession count

the gumbo clay of central louisiana is 
wearing out the brakes on the new 25000 allterrain vehicles the 
army is buying to replace the venerable jeep 
army posts around the world are using the new high mobility 
multipurpose wheeled vehicle but the brake problem appears unique 
to those used at fort polk said post spokesman orina fulton 
about 10 percent of the posts 700 hmmwvs are showing premature 
wear on the brake pads fulton said the vehicles were delivered in 
july and brake trouble showed up in december he said 
he blamed the thick gumbo clay so called because of its soft 
sticky consistency that is common in louisiana 
if youre familiar with fort polk and the surrounding areas it 
looks like sand on top but underneath youve got soft red clay 
fulton said the soil gets onto the brake pads and is staying 
there 
jeeps had no trouble with the clay because they had enclosed drum 
brakes the new vehicle described as a larger wider version of the 
jeep has exposed disc brakes fulton said 
the vehicle nicknamed the hummer is manufactured in mishawaka 
ind by am general corp a division of the ltv missiles amp 
electronics group

the state department said monday that the 
palestine liberation organization cannot escape responsibility 
for an attack by three guerrillas on israeli soldiers and christian 
militiamen in southern lebanon 
spokesman charles e redman said the us administration would 
convey this message at its next meeting with plo representatives 
in tunisia 
the guerrillas were from the democratic front for the liberation 
of palestine which claimed three israeli soldiers and two christian 
militiamen were killed israeli authorities said the guerrillas 
mission was a raid on israel and that there were no fatalities 
before they were gunned down 
the group is considered a radical faction but redman stressed it 
is part of the plo which would be held accountable by the us 
government 
the plo cannot escape responsibility for the actions of its 
constituent elements the spokesman said 
redman added we have made it clear to the plo that these kinds 
of operations have a negative impact on the usplo dialogue and on 
the atmosphere necessary for a positive palestinianisraeli 
dialogue we do not condone this type of activity 
the state department spokesman and then secretary of state james 
a baker iii were also harshly critical of the plo for an earlier 
clash involving two other plo factions in southern lebanon but 
there is no indication the bush administration will break off talks 
with chairman yasser arafats organization 
begun last december by the reagan administration the talks were 
based on a pledge by arafat to renounce terrorism and accepting 
israels right to exist 
several us officials including richard w murphy then the 
assistant secretary of state for near east affairs said the 
dialogue would be suspended if the plo engaged in terrorism 
but baker said on feb 11 after the first incident we are not 
prepared at this time to say this constitutes action by the plo to 
cause us to break off the dialogue 
at the same time he said robert pelletreau the us ambassador 
to tunisia had informed plo officials that actions such as this 
directed against civilian or military targets inside or outside of 
israel were something that gave us trouble 
pelletreau has had four meetings with plo representatives since 
the reagan administration ended a 13year ban on dealing with the 
arafat organization 
there is going to be a meeting on that subject but as for 
timing i really dont have anything yet redman said referring 
to the incident last thursday about a mile north of the israeli 
border 
meanwhile william b quandt a former national security council 
analyst who is now a scholar with the brookings institution said 
the talks with the plo had fallen short of plo expectations and us 
promises 
quandt who met recently with arafat and other plo officials in 
tunis said they were a bit frustrated and disappointed with the 
virtual nonexistence of the usplo dialogue 
he said at a news conference they had been promised at the 
time the dialogue began there would be substantive talks there have 
been virtually none 
asked about quandts account redman said he couldnt speak to 
someone elses expectations 
the spokesman said the decision to talk to the plo was made at 
the end of the previous administration and were now in the early 
stages of a new administration but beyond that i dont really have 
any way to interpret somebody elses expectations 
on another subject redman offered the state departments 
warmest congratulations to egypt and israel on the signing 
sunday of agreements on taba a tiny beach enclave on the red sea 
israel had taken control of taba when it defeated egypt in the 
1967 sixday war and captured the sinai peninsula all of the 
territory except for the 750yardlong resort had been returned as 
part of the 1979 peace treaty between the two countries 
redman reading from a statement said the agreements udner which 
israel is yielding taba and a hotel it built there were a tribute 
to the serious and statesmanlike approach adopted by the two 
parties 
he said the agreements also proved that negotiations worked 
between parties of good will

pollok of the supreme court ruling we would have preferred the 
court to consider some of the issues which we considered very 
important 
biaggi was convicted of accepting gratuities for official acts 
and obstruction of justice and esposito was convicted of giving the 
gratuities 
esposito was sentenced to two years probation and 500 hours of

criticized marxism and called for democratic reform in china was 
invited to the banquet along with his wife li shuxian 
but dozens of police converged to block his car and bar him from 
entering the hotel where the texasstyle barbecue was held sunday 
police then refused to allow him to ride in a taxi and made a bus 
driver pass a stop where he was waiting 
all the arrangements concerning president bushs stay in china 
had been agreed upon by both sides beforehand the official xinhua 
news agency said quoting an unidentified foreign ministry spokesman 
the us side without consulting the chinese side invited 
fang to attend the dinner which was especially in honor of chinese 
leaders therefore the chinese side resented this the spokesman 
said 
visiting world leaders generally hold banquets for their chinese 
hosts but it would be highly unusual for them to submit the guest 
list for chinese approval 
some people are trying to make an issue of fangs 
absence said the foreign ministry spokesman 
we feel sorry that such a thing should happen xinhua quoted 
the spokesman as saying 
bush told vice premier wu xueqian at the airport he regretted the 
actions that kept fang away 
at bushs direction us ambassador winston lord met with vice 
foreign minister zhu qizhen later and reiterated the regret that 
the president had expressed said us embassy spokesman mckinney 
russell 
russell said lord also asked for clarification of what the 
circumstances were 
fang told reporters monday that bushs statement of regret was 
a beginning but added i hope they the americans say 
something more in the next few days 
regarding the united states i have a principled criticism i 
want it to adopt a single standard toward human rights and not a 
double standard he said i think there are indeed some double 
standards in the united states open criticism of the soviet 
unions human rights record but not chinas 
but fang added of course we chinese must win our own human 
rights for ourselves 
bush did not raise human rights issues during his two days of 
meetings with chinese leaders however senior leader deng xiaoping 
and communist party general secretary zhao ziyang stressed that 
domestic stability is more important now than democratic reform 
zhao said dissident demands for multiparty and parliamentarian 
politics in china are unrealistic under current conditions and 
will only undermine efforts to reform the nations central planning 
economic system 
however fang said only after democracy is achieved can the 
reforms be carried out people must independently supervise the 
government 
i cant change my views because of fear he said pledging to 
continue speaking out he said many fellow intellectuals telephoned 
him monday to express support 
bei dao a poet said he was worried that the incident could be 
the prelude to a political crackdown after a period of relative 
cultural freedom 
i was all ready to go back to my work and forget about 
politics he said but if this is how they are openly 
interfering in human rights then i must fight back 
bei is the author of a recent open letter signed by 100 others 
who called for the release of political prisoners the letter echoed 
an earlier one written by fang in january 
dai qing a leading journalist who attended the banquet said she 
was shocked by the news 
their methods are neolithic she said our government has 
changed so much for the better it was pitiful for them to do this 
now 
fang gained fame in 1986 with eloquent speeches to college 
students in which he called for democracy and human rights 
authorities blamed him for a nationwide wave of student 
demonstrations in the winter of 198687 and expelled him from the 
communist party they barred him this year from traveling to the 
united states to attend a scientific conference and teach

an army warrant officer accused of spying for 
the warsaw pact has waived his right to a grand jurytype proceeding 
and will face an immediate courtmartial starting next week the 
service said monday 
the case has been referred to trial as a noncapital case 
however meaning if convicted the maximum punishment would be life 
in prison the army added 
warrant officer james w hall 30 of new york city was arrested 
dec 21 near savannah ga after allegedly admitting to an fbi 
undercover agent that he had been passing classified intelligence 
information to the soviets and east germans for the past six years 
on jan 4 hall was formally charged with 10 counts of espionage 
attempted espionage and failing to obey regulations 
the army has asserted that hall an intelligence analyst with a 
top secret security clearance delivered exposed film and documents 
dealing with communications intelligence a means of defense or 
retaliation against largescale attack war plans and military 
satellites 
at the time of his arrest hall was assigned to the 24th infantry 
division and worked as an intelligence analyst in the armys g2 
intelligence section he joined the army in september 1976 and spent 
most of his career working in europe as an analyst of intercepted 
radio and telephone traffic and coded messages 
legally hall could have insisted the army conduct a socalled 
article 32 hearing a proceeding that resembles a civilian grand 
jury hearing to determine if a courtmartial is warranted 
the soldier decided to waive that hearing however and the 
courtmartial of warrant officer hall will convene on march 6 1989 
at fort mcnair washington dc the army added 
it is anticipated that hall as is his right will request to 
be tried by judge alone he will be tried by military judge col 
howard c eggers the chief of the united states army trial 
judiciary 
it was not immediately clear why the case against hall was being 
referred to trial as a noncapital case 
under a revision to the uniform code of military justice approved 
by congress several years ago the most serious espionage cases can 
be tried as capital cases with the death penalty as maximum 
punishment 
the army said monday that much of the proceeding involving hall 
would be closed to the media and public because of the classified 
nature of the evidence

robert owen who shuttled from washington to 
central america with help for the contra fighters said in a 1986 
memo that rebel leader adolfo calero surrounded himself with 
secondrate people who are liars and greed and power motivated 
the sixpage memo from owen to oliver north was introduced into 
evidence friday at norths trial and released by the court on 
monday it was from tc to bg pseudonyms owen used for 
himself the courier and north blood and guts 
perhaps adolfo calero is the man to lead nicaragua back to 
democracy owen wrote north on march 17 1986 when north was a 
national security council aide he is a creation of the usg us 
government and so he is the horse we chose to ride have no problem 
with this as long as we know and understand his shortcomings 
the best way to do that owen said was to look at the people 
calero trusted 
unfortunately they are not first rate people in fact they are 
liars and greed and power motivated they are not the people to 
rebuild a new nicaragua 
owen said the democratic national front headed by calero has 
done a good job of keeping competent people out of the 
organization 
calero testified in the trial last week praising norths efforts 
on behalf of the contras 
later in his memo owen told north that a coalition of contra 
groups called united nicaraguan opposition uno is a name only 
and there is no substance 
i care and believe in the boys and girls men and women who are 
fighting bleeding dying owen said contending that few of the 
leaders of the movement did 
this war has become a business to many of them there is still 
a belief the marines are going to have to invade so lets get set 
so we will automatically be the ones put in power he wrote 
at the end of the memo owen said he would like to move on 
and get involved in counterterrorism 
i will continue in whatever position you recommend he 
concluded you have been my godfather through this

timothy haggerty lost to city hall 
lost in state court and on monday lost in the highest court in the 
land but he vowed hell continue his 50000 fight over the size 
of his mailbox 
the us supreme court on monday let stand without comment a 
lower court ruling that haggertys mailbox or at least the 
15foothigh structure it was part of had to go 
haggerty a towing service mechanic said from his home the 
decision was expected 
let no one wonder why respect for the legal system is 
collapsing he said but its not over until i give up and i 
havent given up yet 
he said he would consult his attorneys about further action 
at the city attorneys office sharon delegal the latest in a 
string of lawyers who handled the case said she hoped the decision 
ends the matter 
were pleased to say the least ms delegal said the 
bottom line was that the structure which was much bigger than a 
mail box was on public property the city just felt very 
uncomfortable with it 
the structure was built in front of his house in the spring of 
1982 and within a few months had aroused the wrath of local 
officials 
anchored by two subterranean truck engine blocks two water pipes 
rose 15 feet in the air the mail receptacle was attached to a 
horizontal bar about three feet above the ground a second 
horizontal bar several feet above the receptacle served as the base 
of a flagpole 
the structure about six feet wide at its widest point contained 
an old bed frame part of a golf cart and was topped off by a model 
airplane with an air mail designation 
about nine months after haggerty completed it city officials 
told him the mail box violated a city ordinance barring obstructions 
in the public rightofway portion of his property 
haggerty said he was initially accused of blocking traffic 
despite the fact that he lives at the end of a deadend street 
haggerty lost a first round in court and the city removed the 
structure he won on appeal and built another one this time 22 
feet tall to take its place 
the city won round three and haggerty was forced to remove the 
second structure 
he then sought help from the nations highest court his appeal 
contended among other things that the city ordinance is violating 
his freedom of expression 
lawyers for the city urged the justices to reject haggertys 
appeal arguing that he is free to express himself somewhere else on 
his property off the public rightofway

a sheriffs deputy was charged with three 
counts of murder monday in the slayings of three prostitutes and 
officials said special circumstance allegations could mean the death 
penalty if he is convicted 
rickey ross 40 a los angeles county deputy was arrested 
thursday for investigation of murder in the slayings in the 
ganginfested southcentral area of the city 
andy reynolds a spokesman for the prosecutor said the 
specialcircumstance allegations were for multiple murder under 
california law a convicted murderer also found guilty of special 
circumstance allegations can be put to death rather than sentenced 
to life imprisonment 
ross a narcotics investigator with the department for 18 years 
was arrested for investigation of three killings but published and 
broadcast reports have said police are investigating as many as 12 
deaths of the southcentral districts strawberries the street 
name for prostitutes who sell sex for drugs 
attorney jay jaffe who spoke to ross on sunday said he hoped 
police had not rushed to arrest ross in reaction to criticism of the 
departments tactics in investigating the series of prostitute 
deaths 
i hope that he is not the scapegoat for what appeared to be 
public pressure brought on the police department to come up with a 
suspect jaffe said 
some sheriffs department officials had said sunday that a gun 
found in ross car reportedly a 9mm semiautomatic pistol was so 
badly rusted that ballistics experts were having problems positively 
linking the weapon to the one used to kill the prostitutes 
this case is going to be made or broken on the ballistics and 
from what we hear the ballistics are pretty shaky one law 
enforcement officer told the los angeles times 
but the times quoted another unidentified police investigator who 
said a positive comparison had been made of bullets fired from 
the gun taken from the car trunk and those recovered from the bodies 
of the three prostitutes 
we wouldnt put an activeduty sheriffs deputy in jail for 
homicide on an iffy make he said 
ross was stopped in the southcentral district while driving in a 
department car sitting with an alleged prostitute at his side 
authorities said friday the woman told police she and ross had been 
smoking rock cocaine

the attorney for night stalker murder 
defendant richard ramirez is suffering from trialrelated nervous 
exhaustion the judge said monday and the prosecutor said they 
might have to start the trial over 
probably the chances of a mistrial are good deputy district 
attorney p philip halpin said we cant keep this jury hanging 
around indefinitely 
a mistrial would mean a new jury would need to be selected in the 
3yearold case 
ramirez 28 is charged with 13 murders and 30 related felonies 
in a series of grisly nighttime attacks that terrified southern 
california in the summer of 1985 
testimony began jan 30 after six months of jury selection 
a doctors report submitted to the judge said attorney daniel 
hernandez is suffering from stressrelated nervous exhaustion 
resulting from his participation in the longdelayed trial the 
doctor recommended psychological counseling and said recovery could 
take six weeks 
the doctor feels he is not presently able to function 
effectively as trial counsel said superior court judge michael 
tynan who declined to disclose the doctors name 
jurors had been excused since hernandez called in sick tuesday 
this is a novel experience for the court said tynan adding 
that he would hold hearings before he decides on a remedy for the 
situation 
he ordered hernandez and his former cocounsel arturo hernandez 
no relation to be in court wednesday for an inquiry on the state of 
hernandez health and the trials future 
arturo hernandez disappeared from the case without public 
explanation during jury selection he remains a counsel of record in 
the case but halpin said it was unlikely that he would be ordered 
to take over for his ailing colleague 
during the 1985 crime spree an intruder entered homes at night 
through unlocked windows or doors then raped women killed men and 
women with gunshots to the head and stole jewelry and other 
valuables one victims eyes were gouged out and the killer often 
left behind drawings of pentagrams inverted fivepointed stars 
associated with devil worship 
the press dubbed the killer the night stalker and people in 
the los angeles area shut their windows at night despite a heat 
wave terror spread through the state as related crimes were 
reported in san francisco and orange county where charges against 
ramirez are pending 
ramirez was arrested after he was chased and beaten by an angry 
mob in east los angeles during the 1985 labor day weekend when his 
picture first appeared in newspapers as the prime suspect in the 
crime wave 
during his 1985 arraignment ramirez yelled hail satan and 
flashed a picture of a pentagram drawn on his palm several women 
testified at his 1986 preliminary hearing that after their husbands 
were murdered they were raped and ordered to swear to satan

a retired fourstar navy admiral has reimbursed 
the government 3400 for using military personnel to help him move 
files and other possessions from honolulu to begin his retirement 
the navy said monday 
the service in a brief statement said retired adm james a 
ace lyons jr was requested to reimburse the excess costs 
incurred by the government and has voluntarily paid 342094 
to the navy 
the navy said lyons made the payment after navy secretary william 
l ball iii determined that some of the benefits received by adm 
lyons upon his retirement exceeded entitlements 
lyons the former head of the navys pacific fleet in honolulu 
hawaii left his job on oct 1 1987 on short notice not long after 
john f lehman resigned as navy secretary lyons departure also 
came soon after he publicly complained about the manner in which the 
navy was overseeing operation of warships assigned to the persian 
gulf 
according to the navy an anonymous complaint shortly after the 
admiral stepped down from active duty alleged that lyons had 
improperly shipped personal property on a military plane 
the navy said that lyons had shipped some personal property on a 
navy plane when he left honolulu but that those aircraft flights 
had not been ordered just for lyons benefit and the additional 
costs were minimal 
he was asked to reimburse the 3400 however because the 
investigation also found that lyons had asked four military 
personnel to help him in traveling from honolulu to washington to 
start his retirement 
lyons has said he had only a weeks notice to prepare for 
retirement and that he did in fact ask four servicemen to help him 
move his files and other possessions from hawaii

the judge in oliver norths irancontra trial 
adjourned court abruptly monday to clear up a roadblock created 
by an apparent defense attempt to reveal a name the government wants 
to keep secret 
it was the first serious disruption of the trial on national 
security grounds since the jury was sworn last tuesday 
the dispute arose over introduction of a document during 
crossexamination of robert w owen who had acted as norths 
courier shuttling maps money and tactical advice to the rebels 
fighting the sandinista government at a time official us aid was 
banned 
arguments over use of classified information put the start of the 
trial in doubt for weeks and some or all of the charges could still 
be dropped if the bush administration declares there must be no 
disclosure of information that the judge says is needed for north to 
have a fair trial 
us district judge gerhard a gesell did not call the jury into 
court after the lunch break but instead held a 15minute conference 
with lawyers at the bench he then adjourned court for a half hour 
held another bench conference and declared the trial ready to 
proceed but then prosecution lawyer john keker objected again 
ladies and gentlemen im going to excuse you today im going 
to get this roadblock straightened out the judge told the jury 
obviously angry 
afterward he met behind closed doors with lawyers in the case 
for more than an hour a spokesman for the court said owen would be 
back on the witness stand when court opens at 930 am tuesday 
during one bench conference the judge was overheard telling 
prosecutors my ruling is the name must come in indicating the 
dispute involved disclosing the name of a source the government 
wants to keep secret he offered the prosecution a chance to avoid 
disclosure saying owen could be withdrawn as a witness that would 
mean gesell would have to instruct jurors to ignore owens testimony 
all day friday and monday morning 
the dispute started before the noon break owen was being 
questioned about a 1985 trip he took to costa rica to view the site 
of an airfield for rebel resupply operations north lawyer brendan 
sullivan attempted to introduce a document and question him about 
it a private bench conference followed and the judge sent the jury 
to lunch early 
when the trial reconvened gesell apparently ruled at a second 
bench conference that the defense was entitled to use the 
information the ruling triggered a recess while prosecutors 
consulted with administration security experts 
in the postrecess bench conference gesells agitated voice 
could be heard at times in the rear of the courtroom 
i have offered you an opportunity to withdraw the witness 
the judge told keker 
later he said i am willing to try to help you get a 
stipulation a stipulation is an agreement by both sides to a fact 
or set of facts without having to introduce particulars 
earlier monday owen testified that north declared in 1984 he 
would be the reagan administrations point man helping the 
nicaraguan rebels after legal us aid was cut off 
he was going to be the one to take responsibility and in 
essence protect those who were higher than he in the government 
said owen 
he said in essence this scenario had been arranged and okd 
through my norths superiors and i believe he said bill casey 
knew about this owen said referring to the late cia director 
he said he would be the point man to keep the nicaraguans alive 
and if things became public when they went wrong he would be the 
fall guy he used those words for the administration owen said 
owen testifying under immunity from prosecution said he was in 
norths office in the white house complex several times when casey 
either came in or was leaving 
norths defense to many of the 12 criminal charges against him is 
that his actions in supplying aid and advice to the contras after 
congress forbade aid by us intelligence agencies and the military 
were with the knowledge and approval of higher ups including 
thenpresident reagan 
on monday gesell and the lawyers tiptoed around references to 
the names of us and foreign officials whose identities could not 
be disclosed for national security reasons 
he was a senior official owen said of one man from cia 
headquarters he met in san jose costa rica 
your honor said sullivan i dont believe the name is 
classified could i give him the first letter of the last name to 
see if its the same person we are talking about 
the judge told owen to write the name on a piece of paper he 
summoned lawyers to the bench to look at it and after five minutes 
told owen just refer to this name as cia one 
that was joined later by costa rica no 1 and his deputy 
costa rica no 2 
owen said that he and the cia station chief in costa rica toured 
a site for a rebel resupply airfield and that their trip was known 
to the us ambassador there 
that testimony elicited by sullivan under crossexamination was 
an example of the defenses attempt to distribute knowledge of 
norths dealings among higher officials at a time when us aid was 
banned 
cia station chief joseph fernandez known as tomas castillo was 
indicted on charges he illegally helped north set up the airfield in 
costa rica and lied to his superiors that indictment was dismissed 
on procedural grounds but independent counsel lawrence e walsh has 
indicated he will bring the case anew

good things come in threes at rocky

acted like proud papas after their 1300pound holstein named candy 
gave birth to triplet calves 
i dont know if its any big thing or not but it seems kind of 
rare said donald smith 35 the eldest of the human siblings by 
five minutes 
david burrows the brothers veterinarian said cows give birth 
to triplets about one in every 50000 births burrows said he 
usually sees at least one set of triplet cows a year none owned by 
triplet farmers 
the brothers who live about 10 miles west of hagerstown in 
western maryland usually sell bull calves a few days after birth 
but hope they can find a university or feed company to buy the 
calves for research such as testing how triplets grow and respond 
to feeding patterns 
the calves which were born last week havent been named or 
tagged but the smiths can tell them apart all are black and white 
but one has a larger black spot on its rump and the youngest of the 
trio is the smallest

an insurance executive doing volunteer 
work in an aids hospice in toronto last year asked a dying man what 
he could do to help and the patient said he could help him die 
with a little more dignity 
the volunteer ron barbaro president of the canadian branch of 
prudential insurance co of america soon found a way for his 
company to pay death benefits to the dying a program being hailed 
by aids support groups 
here was a situation where this young mans parents were in 
europe and he was alone barbaro recalled during a recent 
telephone interview with the san jose mercury news when he died 
there would be a fair amount of money 20000 or 25000 and yet 
he had nothing right now 
barbaro could do little to help the young man before he died but 
barbaro 56 vowed that i would find a way to give some living 
benefits from our industry to other terminally ill patients 
working with company lawyers actuaries and underwriters he came 
up with the first policy to give terminally ill patients whether 
dying of aids or other causes part of their benefits before they 
die 
we have been looking for a long time to see some leadership 
from the insurance industry in the aids crisis and i think this 
is very creative and a tremendous step forward said leonard 
graff legal director of national gay rights advocates in san 
francisco he said he thought its a very generous and caring 
thing for them to do 
in the past year hundreds of thousands of dollars have been paid 
out with benefits ranging from 40 percent to 70 percent of the 
total benefit depending on the circumstances the remainder of the 
benefits are paid to the beneficiary when the patient dies 
gerald haims an insurance analyst with seidler amdec securities 
in los angeles said the move was not only a humanitarian gesture 
but it makes good dollars and cents too 
this is something prudential can really capitalize on said 
haims can you imagine the appeal in terms of advertising not 
only would you have an immediate following among gay and lesbian 
communities but every humanitarian out there will be impressed by 
it im impressed by it 
barbaro said he has received many inquiries from other insurance 
officials in canada and the united states 
theyre looking very seriously at it because theres no 
downside said barbaro noting that insurance companies dont lose 
money by making payments in advance 
conventional wisdom has always been that you dont pay a claim 
until somebody has died he said but my question was why not 
if the numbers work out 
joseph v vecchione prudentials vice president for public 
relations in the united states said the payments are not being made 
to policyholders in the us because there are many legal 
difficulties in this country which would have to be resolved 
canadian laws are different and our attorneys there feel we can 
proceed he said we will take a close look at what ensues in 
canada 
ben schatz director of the groups aids civil rights project and 
a member of the aids advisory committee of the national association 
of insurance commissioners called prudentials policy unique in 
the insurance industry and said it shows profits and compassion 
do not necessarily have to conflict 
we have seen depressingly few creative health approaches coming 
out of the insurance industry said schatz its nice to see an 
exception

the pentagon is inching closer to several 
deadlines for important policy decisions as john towers nomination 
to become defense secretary founders on capitol hill 
foremost among those decisions are several involving the 1990 
budget 
while the four military services have prepared recommendations to 
achieve the spending cuts promised by bush officials would normally 
be receiving guidance from a defense secretary by now 
if this drags on much longer i dont know when were going to 
get a budget observed one official who works in the financial 
arena and who spoke only on the condition of anonymity 
towers nomination comes before the full senate wednesday the 
armed services committee recommended by an 119 vote last week that 
he not be confirmed 
is the department functioning sure observed one source who 
insisted upon anonymity we are awarding contracts every day and 
training people to fight every day 
but without a secretary of defense we dont have any kind of 
new team in the top bureaucratic positions and that means months of 
delays down the road in having people geared up to deal with budget 
and policy matters 
beyond the budget problems the bush administration is facing 
deadlines for policy decisions and debates have begun without the 
pentagon really being represented said several sources all of whom 
spoke on the condition they not be named 
for example bush is scheduled to report wednesday his view of a 
proposal to develop a limited star wars defense system known as the 
accident launch protection system on march 15 the president is to 
provide a study of how a new nuclear arms treaty with the soviets 
would affect the structure of us nuclear forces 
by early may bush has promised completion of a special 90day 
national security policy review and at some point soon he must 
advise congress whether he wants to develop the singlewarhead 
midgetman missile or a railcar version of the huge mx missile 
finally the administration has pledged to oversee reform of the 
pentagons weaponsbuying process in the wake of the continuing 
federal fraud investigation 
we need somebody in the job said one official you cant 
muddle through forever

president jose napoleon duartes 
proposal to postpone the presidential election as demanded by 
leftist rebels was rejected monday by the oppositioncontrolled 
legislature 
in a nationwide television address sunday duarte proposed a 
ceasefire and direct negotiations with the insurgents on tuesday in 
guatemala he also called for postponing the march 19 election to 
april 30 a date the rebels have rejected as too early 
the unicameral legislative assembly is controlled by the rightist 
republican nationalist alliance or arena the rightists are favored 
to win the presidency from duartes christian democrats and 
adamantly have rejected any postponement of the vote 
ricardo alvarenga president of the assembly and an arena leader 
said at a news conference that the election date is set and it 
must be fulfilled it is not by altering the constitutional order 
that problems are resolved 
rebel leader salvador samayoa said in an interview that duartes 
proposal has problems and evident loopholes but we will put out a 
constructive response not a negative one 
his group the farabundo marti liberation front had originally 
called for elections in september but then said it would accept a 
vote in july 
duartes term expires june 1 the 63yearold duarte who is 
suffering from terminal liver cancer is expected to survive until 
then 
the united states had hailed duartes proposal 
in our judgment this is potentially the most significant 
opportunity ever for peace in el salvador particularly the 
commitment of the government of el salvador to undertake a cessation 
of hostilities if the fmln agrees within 48 hours state 
department spokesman charles redman said in washington 
duarte acknowledged sunday there would be constitutional problems 
with delaying the election but suggested they could be resolved 
either through an accord involving the three branches of government 
or by a plebiscite 
the fmln said in january if the election were postponed a 
significant time period it would take part and respect the outcome 
that was seen as a major turnabout by the marxistled rebels who 
have boycotted and condemned the five previous national elections 
this decade 
duarte originally rejected the guerrilla proposal as insincere 
he also had said postponement of the election past march 31 would be 
unconstitutional 
he did not explain sunday why april 30 could be considered a 
legal date the constitution says elections must be held at least 
two months before the end of the incumbents term 
alvarenga opposed the plebiscite proposal 
why have a plebiscite the presidential election is a 
plebiscite a consultation of the popular will and it must be 
carried out as scheduled he said 
he said the legislature must analyze duartes proposal 
leaders of the democratic convergence a leftist alliance the 
guerrillas would support if they took part in the vote said 
duartes proposal had good and bad points 
convergence leader ruben zamora said at a news conference that 
direct talks could be productive but that an april 30 election date 
is not acceptable and does not contribute to peace 
the 7000member guerrilla army has been fighting the 
governments armed force of 56000 for nine years the civil war has 
ravaged the country and an estimated 70000 people most of them 
civilians have been killed

thousands of illegal aliens may have been shuttled 
across the country on a daily eastern airlines flight from los 
angeles to new york an official said monday after 79 people were 
apprehended 
agents of the immigration and naturalization service apprehended 
the suspected illegal aliens shortly after eastern flight 80s 
arrival for a stopover at hartsfield atlanta international airport 
we believe this is one of the largest operations weve 
conducted that involves illegal aliens on board commercial aircraft 
here in the us said thomas p fischer district director of the 
atlanta ins office 
this may be part of a massive alien smuggling operation he 
said adding that the ins would continue to investigate 
investigators believe illegal aliens had been aboard the same 
eastern flight nearly every day for the past 30 days said tom 
thomas an ins spokesman in atlanta it appears at this point from 
our sources that its almost a daily occurrence he said 
he estimated that thousands had been moved across the country on 
eastern airliners he said authorities did not know how they entered 
the country 
thomas said eastern had cooperated fully in the investigation 
we dont in any way connect eastern and dont want to intimate 
that they were even remotely involved at this point thomas said 
in miami eastern airlines spokeswoman virginia sanchez said 
all i know is that the ins had told us theyd be monitoring a 
flight this week and of course we cooperated with them 
the suspected aliens taken off mondays flight included 39 from 
mexico 22 from guatemala 13 from the dominican republic three 
from el salvador and one each from honduras and ecuador they were 
to be transferred to ins processing centers in florida and texas for 
deportations thomas said 
thomas said some of the aliens paid smugglers up to 4000 for a 
package deal although authorities dont know what that deal 
included other than air fare from california to new york 
we dont know if that was out of the country to get into the 
country to get set up in new york he said adding that the 
package could have included living arrangements phony documents and 
a job 
oneway coach tickets on the plane monday cost from 433 to 577 
including taxes according to a travel agent 
one alien was juan de la cruzrodriguez 34 who said he wanted 
to make money to send to his wife and three young sons in the 
dominican republic he told the atlanta journal that a smuggler in 
mexico helped him and about a dozen others cross the border then 
arranged to have them transported by flatbed truck to los angeles 
he said he sold his truck to raise part of the money and gave the 
smuggler almost 1000 he held up a quarter and said thats all 
i have left 
i always had the image of america having a lot of money and a 
lot of wealth and that i could find work without any problem he 
said adding that he will do whatever he can to stay here because 
if i go back theyll put me in prison theyll kill me if i dont 
pay what i owe 
special ins agents working the case acted on tips from 
confidential sources at the atlanta airport airline employees 
undercover operations in the los angeles area and even a commuter 
thomas said 
theres a commuter who regularly flies from los angeles to 
atlanta who called our office and said hey it seems theres 
an awful lot of hispanic people who fly this flight you might want 
to check into it he said 
thomas speculated that easterns flight 80 might have been 
popular because no transfers were involved and rates might have been 
cheaper

echoes of the 1988 presidential campaign 
reverberated at a meeting of the nations governors monday when 
former democratic nominee michael dukakis challenged the bush 
administrations commitment to dealing with urban problems 
jack kemp president bushs new secretary of housing and urban 
development gave the governors an enthusiastic presentation of his 
plans to attack poverty and homelessness and to help reinvigorate 
the nations cities 
when the former new york congressman finished the massachusetts 
governor who was the 1988 democratic presidential nominee said i 
applaud kemps goals 
on the other hand he went on as i look over the 
presidents budget there is a yawning gap between what youre saying 
and whats in there 
kemp who was one of bushs rivals for the gop presidential 
nomination cited federal budget problems but also pledged i can 
assure you that i am going to do everything i can to make sure that 
there is adequate funding for those programs that work 
the housing secretary also said im going to be tenacious and 
indeed audacious in looking for programs that are not working as 
well and where we can save some money 
the budget does need some reworking said dukakis who 
carried only 10 states in the november election he cited the 
administrations proposal to cut back the community development 
block grant program which he said local governments use to attract 
private investment in housing and other development projects 
attorney general dick thornburgh and william bennett bushs 
choice to lead the governments antidrug efforts also appeared 
before the governors telling them the administration is committed 
to dealing with the drug problem 
to achieve what president bush has expressed as a goal of a 
kinder and gentler america were going to have to get rougher and 
tougher with some americans said thornburgh those who are 
engaged in drug trafficking and drugrelated violence are going to 
have to be focused on if we are going to have safer streets and 
safer communities 
bennett the former secretary of education said in some 
places the problem is nothing short of ferocious 
but he went on we have seen a remarkable shift in public 
attitudes that shift has shown that the public is very serious 
about this issue and prepared to accept strong measures to combat 
drugs said bennett 
william k reilly the new director of the environmental 
protection agency told the governors that enforcement of 
environmental laws and regulations is at the heart of the epa 
mission it gives vigor effectiveness and vitality and reality to 
all else that we do it will have our highest priority 
on a matter of particular concern to governors who have nuclear 
weapons facilities in their states reilly said his agency would 
direct enforcement at governmental facilities as well as at private 
industry 
he also told the governors that dealing with pollution is going 
to require changes in habits in lifestyle choices from all 
households in the country eventually i think 
he cited programs under way in some communities that require 
people to separate waste to help in recycling 
at a discussion on caring for children the governors heard from 
a panel of teenagers from arkansas 
when gov bill clinton of arkansas asked their views on how to 
reduce teenage pregancies two of the young people recommended more 
education while rejecting proposals for distributing birth control 
materials 
then jerrold culp from lee senior high school in marianna drew 
laughter from the governors when he said in my area i think we 
just need something else to do 
on the problem of school dropouts courtney robinson of sheridan 
high school in sheridan told the governors that schools need to be 
more personalized 
some students feel isolated some students feel detached she 
said students lives have to be touched

a marine corps captain facing possible 
dismissal for associating with lesbians said monday she wanted a 
courtmartial instead of the board of inquiry that ruled against her 
i wanted to see my accusers capt judy meade said in a 
telephone interview instead the prosecutor put in statements 
the witnesses made many statements but prosecutors just took 
what they wanted to put in 
a board of five colonels recommended sunday that ms meade 
receive an other than honorable discharge after concluding that 
her association with lesbians constituted conduct unbecoming an 
officer 
ms meades attorney vaughn taylor criticized the proceedings 
during the fiveday hearing last week saying it did not allow for 
the defense to crossexamine witnesses 
the board of inquiry differs from a courtmartial in that five 
marine officers hear the governments presentation and then rule 
the board has a legal adviser available to them 
ms meade said she was not allowed to subpoena witnesses 
maj stuart wagner a camp lejeune spokesman said there wasnt 
enough evidence to have a courtmartial for a criminal charge 
it isnt a crime to associate with a lesbian and this was not 
a criminal procedure wagner said this was an administrative 
procedure akin to an employer deciding if an employee had 
further service i think what was in question was her judgment 
and the effect that that judgment had with her personal relations 
and her marine corps relations 
professor barry nakell of the university of north carolina school 
of law a civil rights specialist said he thought ms meades 
choice of friends should be constitutionally protected by the right 
of freedom of association 
my position would be that as long as there is nothing about the 
friendships that would compromise security and there is nothing 
to show what her sexual preference is it should be constitutionally 
protected he said 
but wagner said a question of leadership was involved 
i dont think the question at any time was whether capt meade 
was a homosexual wagner said the question was whether her 
relationship and the consequences of that relationship affected her 
ability to be an effective marine officer and remain in the marine 
corps the marine corps is a way of life 
ms meade said she hopes for an honorable discharge for her 12 
years of service the final decision will be made by the secretary 
of the navy 
ms meade 36 a military police officer said she is angry over 
the treatment she has received but also said she would not 
criticize the corps 
the marine corps is a good organization im never going to put 
the marine corps down its not the organization its just some 
individuals in it she said 
most of the allegations against ms meade stemmed from a february 
1988 visit she made to the home of paula berry of beaufort sc 
government witnesses said they saw ms meade in ms berrys bed 
with her then 
both ms berry and ms meade acknowledged during the hearing that 
ms berry is a lesbian but denied that the two ever had sexual 
contact ms berry said they slept in the same bed once when ms 
meade fell asleep watching television 
the board also said ms meade had failed to report suspected 
lesbian activity and had misled her superior officers by 
withholding information that ms berry was a lesbian it also said 
ms meade frequented a bar which was known by her to have a 
questionable reputation 
ms meade said she plans to pursue a career in security or law 
enforcement

charging that they have been intimidated and threatened with loss of 
jobs a hearing is set for march 20 
they claim harassment began after united stanford workers told

the food and drug administration on monday 
issued standards for expectorants in nonprescription coughcold 
medicines that allow only one proven active ingredient to remain on 
the market 
guaifenesin was the only ingredient found by the fda to be safe 
and effective in increasing sputum or phlegm volume and making it 
easier to cough up 
it is the most wiely used active ingredient used in expectorants 
and is contained in the major brands of coughcold medicines the 
fda said 
about 20 other expectorant ingredients were found not to be 
useful and products using these ingredients will have to be 
reformulated or taken off the market within one year the fda said 
eight products listed in the handbook of nonprescription drugs would 
fall into this category 
among the 20 ingredients are ammonium chloride a plant extract 
called horehound pine tar spirits of turpentine and squill the 
dried inner scales of a flowering plant 
the fda standards were developed as part of a review of all 
nonprescription drugs that began in 1972 
the standards will let expectorant products using guaifenesin 
claim on their labels that they help loosen phlegm sputum and 
thin bronchial secretions to rid the bronchial passageways of 
bothersome mucus drain bronchial tubes and make coughs more 
productive 
however the fda said these products will not be able to claim 
that they relieve irritated membranes in the respiratory 
passageways by preventing dryness through increased mucus flow 
this claim was not supported by studies the agency said 
labels for expectorant products must contain two warnings the 
fda said 
do not take this product for persistent or chronic cough such as 
occurs with smoking asthma chronic bronchitis or emphysema or 
where cough is accompanied by excessive phlegm unless directed by a 
doctor 
a persistent cough may be a sign of a serious condition if 
cough persists for more than one week tends to recur or is 
accompanied by fever rash or persistent headache consult a 
doctor

dr louis sullivan apparently heading for 
confirmation as health and human services secretary repeated his 
opposition to abortion and fielded a broad range of questions on 
other topics from a senate committee monday 
the abortion issue which has dogged the atlanta doctor since his 
nomination was announced got only brief mention at the hearing 
before the senate labor and human resources committee as it did 
before the senate finance committee last week 
in his opening statement sullivan said that abortion is wrong 
and that it is inconsistent with the best of family values 
he said that like president bush he opposes abortion except in 
cases of rape incest or danger to the life of a mother and is 
against federal funding of abortions except to save a mothers life 
later sen orrin hatch rutah asked sullivan to restate his 
views on abortion which the doctor did adding that he has never 
performed the procedure 
in response to subsequent questions from hatch sullivan also 
said he would welcome a supreme court decision overturning its 1973 
ruling that legalized abortion he said he supported the health and 
human services departments position that family planning funds 
should not be used for abortions 
sullivan however again sidestepped the question of whether the 
federal government should pay for research that uses tissue from 
aborted fetuses he said he would not state a position on the issue 
until he had read the recommendations of an advisory committee 
hatch a fervent opponent of abortion said he was satisfied with 
sullivans views and fully supported his nomination 
the finance committee last week recommended full senate approval 
of sullivans nomination on a 190 vote and sen edward kennedy 
dmass chairman of the labor committee predicted a unanimous 
senate vote for sullivan on tuesday 
both committees have jurisdiction over department programs but 
the finance committee is the panel that recommends action on the 
nomination to the full senate kennedys committee will not vote 
separately on the nomination 
his committee covered much of the same ground that the finance 
committee did devoting little time to abortion the issue that has 
caused sullivan the most problems last week he apologized to sen 
bob packwood rore saying he misspoke in private remarks on 
the subject he was quoted earlier in an interview with the atlanta 
journal constitution as supporting a womans right to abortion 
on monday senators focused more attention on president bushs 
fiscal 1990 budget proposal that would trim anticipated medicare 
spending by 5 billion and the effects of soaring medical costs on 
the federal budget

state rep paul clymer admitted monday he 
reached the wrong conclusions when he suggested pennsylvanias 
minimum wage was adequate because minorities slow learners and 
students take home the paychecks 
but some black legislators labeled clymers remarks racist 
and rooted in a slave mentality 
its sad really sad said sen hardy williams a black 
democrat from philadelphia his reasoning has no place in our 
society what hes saying is that he wants to underpay a whole class 
of society 
clymer a fiveterm republican from a largely rural 
predominantly white district in bucks county made the statements 
about lowerwage earners in a survey of state lawmakers by the 
associated press answering a question about the states 370 
hourly minimum wage which was boosted 35 cents in february he 
responded 
the 35cent increase is adequate remember the people earning 
minimum wage are minorities slow learners students and parttime 
employees 
clymer went on to say that the federal government should be 
setting the minimum wage and that any further increases at the 
state level would send a negative signal to business 
in an interview monday clymer admitted his statements appeared 
terrible but he denied that any malice was involved 
i just didnt put it right he said i thought it through 
but the conclusions i wanted to draw were not there they were the 
wrong conclusions its unfortunate i did not take more time what i 
should have done is take more time 
clymer said he had been trying to explain that the minimum wage 
sometimes provides the only employment opportunities for workers in 
areas with high unemployment or where jobs are scarce 
the minimum wage would give them a chance this doesnt mean 
that they shouldnt be making more money he said 
clymer stopped short of apologizing for the remarks saying he 
meant no harm and had simply misstated his position 
but williams said the remarks showed a slave mentality and 
were very racist 
rep david richardson a philadelphia democrat who chairs the 
national black caucus of state legislators said clymer should 
retract the statement and apologize 
it is very clear to me that this recent outburst of racial 
intimidation and racial slurs is a shame abominable and a 
disgrace he said 
althea simmons director of the washington office of the national

the pratt amp whitney division of united 
technologies corp on monday won the largest share of the air 
forces fiscal 1990 jet engine business beating out the general 
electric co for the third straight year 
the air force in a brief announcement said pratt amp whitney 
would be asked to build 64 percent of the basic jet engines now used 
in its fighters during the year starting next oct 1 while ge would 
produce the remaining 36 percent 
the service said it planned to acquire 109 of those engines 
during fiscal 1990 the 6436 split would give pratt amp whitney 70 of 
those engines and ge 39 
and in another major coup for pratt amp whitney the air force said 
it would split its first buy of new increased performance 
engines for the 1990s by a 56to44 percent margin in favor of pratt 
current plans call for the purchase of 122 of the more powerful 
engines in fiscal 1990 sixtyeight of them will be purchased from 
pratt amp whitney and the remaining 54 will come from ge the air 
force said 
all told pratt amp whitney will build 138 basic and increased 
performance engines in fiscal 1990 while ge will build 93 of its 
basic and increased performance engines 
the air force said it would award the final contracts for the 
basic engines being purchased in fiscal 1990 soon until that 
happens however the service declined to estimate their values 
the contracts for the increased performance engines though were 
awarded monday they total 1464 million to pratt amp whitney and 
1268 million to general electric 
the air force launched what has been called the great engine 
war in 1983 when it decided to stage annual competitions for the 
right to supply engines for its two frontline fighters the f15 
eagle and the f16 fighting falcon 
until that point pratt amp whitney held a monopoly on providing 
the highperformance engines 
during the first round of the competition ge shattered pratt amp 
whitneys monopoly by winning the right to produce 75 percent of the 
engines in fiscal 1985 pratt amp whitney rebounded in fiscal 1986 by 
winning 46 percent of the total but ge still won the majority of 
the business 
ge then managed to increase slightly its share of the air forces 
business for fiscal 1987 by winning 56 percent of the award to pratt 
amp whitneys 44 percent but pratt amp whitney finally reclaimed the 
top spot in fiscal 1988 winning 55 percent of the business compared 
to ges 45 percent and then held on to win the same percentage 
split in 1989 
the air force has described the competition as producing lower 
bid prices and muchimproved warranties from the two manufacturers 
with the fiscal 1990 split included ge has now won contracts to 
produce 833 of its basic f110 engines while pratt amp whitney has won 
contracts to manufacture 768 of its f100220 engines 
if the split is included for the new increased performance 
engines ge has won awards for a total 887 engines and pratt amp 
whitney 836 
the f15 and f16 are the air forces topline fighters and are 
made by mcdonnell douglas corp and general dynamics corp 
respectively

renegade who blasphemed islam in his novel the satanic verses 
moslem theologians said monday but they did not endorse irans 
decree that he be killed 
after a conference in mecca sponsored by the world moslem league 
the theologians said the british author born in india to moslem 
parents and his publishers should be tried by relevant courts

abdullah naseef secretarygeneral of the league issued a 
conference statement urging the 46member organization of islamic 
conference to pursue that goal and to boycott publishing houses that 
promote the book 
the statement distributed by the official saudi news agency 
said rushdies public apology was insufficient it said he must 
confess that what he wrote about islam the prophet mohammed and his 
wives and the prophet abraham was pure lies and fabrication 
diplomatic sources said privately it would be left to the 
organization of islamic conference to seek a trial either in the 
british courts or in absentia in an islamic country 
alsharq alawsat a saudi daily said wednesday that the meeting 
in mecca the holy city of islam would demand rushdie be tried in 
an islamic state and would ask the conference to start legal 
proceedings in britain

tried and refuse to repent

foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze of 
the soviet union ended a visit to iran on monday that he said forged 
closer relations despite ideological differences 
tehrans official islamic republic news agency reported that 
shevardnadze also said in meetings with president ali khamenei and 
hashemi rafsanjani the parliament speaker that us naval forces 
should withdraw from the persian gulf 
shevardnadze was the highest soviet official to visit iran since 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis fundamentalist islamic revolution 
overthrew the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi in february 1979 
we believe relations between iran and the soviet union have 
been substantially transformed he said before leaving for moscow 
irna said shevardnadze renewed an invitation to rafsanjani to 
visit moscow and the speaker accepted 
tass the official soviet news agency said the two governments 
can constructively cooperate on many international problems 
with iran confronting the west over khomeinis order that salman 
rushdie be killed for his novel the satanic verses which many 
moslems say blasphemes islam sovietiranian relations are at their 
best since the revolution 
khomeini and shevardnadze met sunday but iranian reports 
indicated they did not discuss the rushdie controversy despite 
britains request to the soviet foreign minister that he bring it up 
after meeting khamanei on monday shevardnadze conferred with 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati and signed political and 
cultural agreements irna reported the agreements underscored new 
horizons in political ties between tehran and moscow shevardnadze 
was quoted as saying 
his success in bolstering sovietiranian relations climaxed a 
10day fivenation middle east tour aimed at widening the soviet 
role in a region that has long been considered a us preserve 
irna did not quote shevardnadze as saying what differences remain 
between iran and the soviet union but the communist blocs state 
atheism is anathema to irans fundamentalist moslem leaders the 
soviets were the main arms suppliers to iraq during the war with 
iran 
many iranian leaders while prepared to bolster ties with the 
soviets remain wary of their giant northern neighbor who briefly 
occupied part of their country after world war ii the soviet 
withdrawal from afghanistan irans eastern islamic neighbor has 
eliminated a major source of friction 
we have come to the conclusion that it is a must to acknowledge 
others beliefs and respect them shevardnadze said in our 
opinion iran enjoys high international prestige 
he said the soviets would push for progress in the iraniraq 
peace talks which have been stalled since the aug 20 ceasefire 
khamenei called on the soviets to pressure iraq to stop its 
alleged stalling in the negotiations so that a peace treaty can be 
signed 
shevardnadze reiterated his call in baghdad for the withdrawal of 
foreign forces from the gulf he had said in baghdad that moscow was 
willing to withdraw its ships 
we have explicitly announced to the american president that we 
condemn the us military presence in the persian gulf and will 
continue this policy until the americans withdraw their troops from 
the region he said 
the united states has 23 warships in and around the gulf the 
soviets have seven to nine most european warships have left 
the major powers either sent warships into the gulf or increased 
their naval squadrons to protect merchant ships from iranian attacks 
launched in retaliation for iraqi air raids 
irna said that khamenei told shevardnadze that iraq must be 
pressured to break the deadlock in the peace talks and we think 
your government can exert this pressure more than anyone else the 
soviet union has a friendship treaty with baghdad and is believed to 
be one of its largest creditors 
tehran radio broadcast excerpts of the meeting between 
shevardnadze and khomeini irna said shevardnadze was the first 
foreign official to talk to khomeini at his home 
khomeini seldom meets foreign dignitaries and it was the first 
he had been heard speaking publicly in months 
irna said khomeini agreed to meet shevardnadze because he wanted 
to hear a response to a message he sent to soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev in january 
shevardnadze said khomeinis message praising gorbachevs 
reforms and urging him to accept islam had received a good 
response from soviet leaders who read it although they did not 
agree with all of it 
khomeini stressed the importance of the expansion of strong 
ties in various dimensions in confronting the devilish acts of the 
west tehran radio said 
irans majlis or parliament votes tuesday on a bill to sever 
relations with britain for publishing the satanic verses and 
leading european nations in recalling their senior diplomats from 
tehran to protest the khomeinis kill rushdie religious decree 
tehran newspapers monday supported severing ties irna quoted 
qorbanali salehabadi a member of parliament as predicting 
relations will be broken off god willing we will approve this 
bill tomorrow he said 
britain recalled its diplomats from tehran and asked irans to 
leave london after khomeini issued his execution order feb 14 
fourteen other western nations have withdrawn their top diplomats 
from iran in the furor over khomeinis death sentence

the government on monday said lowincome 
applicants for subsidized telephone service no longer will have to 
show theyve had no phone for the previous three months or that 
theyve received no federal phone aid for two years 
the federal communications commission said those requirements for 
link up america aid were denying service to 15 percent of all 
applicants 
the yearold federal assistance plan is designed to encourage 
lowincome households to obtain telephone service by helping pay for 
installation 
qualifying households may receive up to 30 to help defray such 
costs 
gerald brock chief of the fccs common carrier bureau said 
there were 385000 people in 37 states the district of columbia and 
puerto rico in the program 
brock said the commission decided to loosen the requirements when 
it was shown it would not cost the government very much 
we are finding that it has been an effective program but it has 
not been so well used that the financial requirements were 
overwhelming brock told reporters thats one of the reasons 
why we put more restrictions on at the beginning 
in another action monday the fcc ruled that radio equipment used 
to provide phone service to remote areas will be considered as 
belonging to the telephone companies and consumers will not have to 
buy it 
the commission made its ruling on a petition filed by the 
colorado consulting firm of tallon cheeseman amp associates regarding 
the basic exchange telecommunications radio service 
the commission said the antenna and radio equipment located on or 
near the premises of users of the service should be treated as 
regulated network equipment and is eligible for federal and state 
programs designed to assist telephone companies that provide service 
in highcost areas 
the company estimated the cost of this equipment to range from 
2200 to 2400 the commission said 
the ruling means the fcc will increase the federal assistance 
available to rural phone companies and their customers to install 
such equipment and the users will pay the same basic service 
charges as regular phone users in the area

the palestine liberation organization will not 
call a halt to the uprising on the west bank and in gaza before 
israel agrees to negotiate a group of scholars who met recently 
with yasser arafat said monday 
the 15month uprising could be notched up a bit or notched 
down as part of the plos strategy for drawing israel into 
negotiations former white house official william b quandt said 
however recounting recent talks in tunis with arafat and other 
plo officials quandt said they did not offer to call off the 
intefadeh in which 386 palestinian arabs and 17 israelis have 
died if israel yielded 
quandt who was an analyst on the middle east and the persian 
gulf at the national security council was accompanied to tunis for 
the plo meetings by former assistant secretary of state harold h 
saunders and helena cobban a scholar they are now at the brookings 
institution a private research group 
israel has refused to negotiate with the plo accusing it of 
terrorism and citing a provision in the plo covenant calling for the 
destruction of the jewish state the united states last december 
opened talks with the plo 
however quandt said the talks had fallen short of plo 
expectations and us promises he said he found arafat and other 
plo officials a bit frustrated and disappointed with the virtual 
nonexistence of the usplo dialogue 
the former carter administration official added they had been 
promised at the time the dialogue began there would be substantive 
talks there have been virtually none 
asked about quandts account charles e redman the state 
department spokesman said he couldnt speak to someone elses 
expectations 
the us official said the government decision to talk to the plo 
was made at the end of the previous administration and were now 
in the early stages of a new administration but beyond that i 
dont really have any way to interpret somebody elses 
expectations 
on a related subject saunders said the plo envisioned a 
twostate solution to its dispute with israel with no berlin wall 
or barbed wires in between 
amyone who commits a terrorist act against israel would be 
punished saunders said 
the plo leaders told the american delegation they had hoped in 
the past to create a single secular state saunders said but they 
said in tunis we are transformed and are prepared to live in 
permanent peace alongside israel he said 
saunders said arafat envisioned open borders and full diplomatic 
relations with israel plus economic relations with jordan as well

the sr71 blackbird a futuristiclooking spy 
plane whose speed records have never been broken and which can 
photograph a license plate from 17 miles up will retire after 
nearly 25 years of service the air force said monday 
the black twinengine jet was the original stealth aircraft and 
was never armed because it can easily outrace enemy missiles and 
fighters air force officials said 
exact figures are classified but the air force reportedly will 
save up to 300 million a year by retiring the sr71 squadron on 
oct 1 
defense budget priorities are forcing the sr71 fleet into 
mothballs and satellites will take over its duties a pentagon 
spokesman said 
we will rely on existing reconnaissance capabilities which i 
cant be real specific about but you can assume that it is mainly 
satellite capability air force lt col joe purka said in a 
telephone interview 
although still largely shrouded in secrecy some details of the 
elusive photo reconnaissance plane have been made public and it was 
even featured in a 198485 television series call to glory 
about an air force family 
despite its age the first one was delivered in 1966 it still 
holds world records for jetpowered speed and altitude set in 1976 
with a speed of 2193 mph and an altitude of 85000 feet 
in september 1974 a blackbird flew from london to los angeles in 
3 hours 47 minutes or taking into account the time zones it 
crossed four hours before it left 
air force pilot lt col bill orcutt says the jet carries 
considerable mystique despite its vintage 
it looks like something from outer space orcutt said 
recently the sr71 excites the boy in all of us who love to fly 
at peak altitude pilots can view the curvature of the earth and 
when they look straight up they see the blackness of space 
the blackbirds speed of more than 2000 mph is three times the 
speed of sound or 33 miles a minute faster than a rifle bullet it 
can survey 100 square miles an hour he said 
the air force tried to retire the blackbird squadron last year 
but was overruled by congress 
house armed services subcommittee staffer jim waters said no such 
move has been made in washington so far but couldnt predict 
whether congress would fight the planned retirement 
its a very costly system to operate but there are people 
both in the military and in congress that want to keep it around 
waters said 
nine or 10 blackbirds reportedly remain from the original lot of 
about 30 
the sr71 squadron is headquartered at beale air force base near 
marysville in northern california its support facilities are at air 
force plant 42 about 50 miles north of los angeles in palmdale 
plant 42 is the site of the air forces stealth research and 
development which began with blackbirds sleek design and 
radarevading capabilities officials said 
the supersecret plane built by lockheed corp as a successor to 
the u2 was officially acknowledged by thenpresident lyndon johnson 
on july 24 1964 
development began in february 1963 and the first model was 
delivered in january 1966 purka said 
operated under the strategic air command the sr71s also operate 
out of bases in england and japan said sac spokeswoman maj suzanne 
randall

demands were met including the abandonment of planned 
constitutional changes that would give serbia more control over the 
province 
at another mine workers from the provinces slavic minority 
began a strike in support of the party officials 
the official tanjug news agency said the government put emergency 
measures into effect immediately in kosovo an autonomous province 
of the serbian republic but did not describe them 
air force jets flew over the provincial capital pristina several 
times in a show of might by the federal government which is trying 
to end a wave of protests by ethnic albanians in kosovo that began 
with the miners strike

vehicles loaded with soldiers headed toward titova mitrovica where 
the miners were occupying the trepca lead and zinc mine

three officials who are ethnic albanians but are seen as supporters 
of the serbian communist party 
the state tanjug news agency said that the first of the 1300 
ethnic albanian miners were taken out of the mine shaft on 
stretchers at about 2130 local time 3 pm est and that the 
others followed 
belgrade television showed a film clip with weakened miners 
coming out of the pit leaning on each other and supported by medical 
staff who shielded their eyes from the tv light 
kosovo is adjacent to albania and its population of 18 million 
is 90 percent ethnic albanian minority slavs often complain of 
discrimination in the province and martial law was imposed briefly 
in 1981 after bloody riots between ethnic albanians and security 
forces 
rahman morina the provincial party chief resigned monday and 
belgrade radio quoted him as saying in a comment directed at the 
trepca miners i am deeply shaken that you consider me responsible 
for your lives and health it is only for this reason that i am 
submitting the resignation 
husamedin azemi party chief of pristina cited moral 
considerations and blackmail for resigning serb and 
montenegrin members of the pristina party leadership threatened to 
quit if azemi left his post 
ali sukrija kosovos member in the countrys policysetting 
central committee also stepped down 
at another lead and zinc mine 800 members of kosovos slavic 
minority occupied their pits and said they would continue the strike

the governor and a former ku klux klan 
grand wizard recently elected to the state legislature locked horns 
monday over setting aside some state highway contracts for 
blackowned companies 
we have a very clear process of racial discrimination going on 
in this bill rep david duke said during an appearance before the 
house appropriations committee 
gov buddy roemer also making an appearance before the 
committee said he did not believe the minority setasides would be 
a permanent fixture in awarding highway contracts they are only a 
transition the democrat said 
duke a republican from suburban new orleans was elected to the 
state legislature feb 18 after a heated campaign in which he drew 
opposition from president bush former president reagan and most of 
the areas political elite 
he is not a member of the appropriations panel like the 
governor he appeared to testify about the setaside programs 
for duke it was one of the first opportunities to address a 
campaign pledge to oppose special treatment for blacks 
the committee voted 123 against duke and for the governor 
sending the bill to the house floor for debate 
under setasides a portion of government contracts are reserved 
for minorityowned companies as a remedy for past discrimination 
roemer who wants a 15 billion program for highways airports 
and ports financed by an additional 4cent tax on gasoline said the 
bill would make sure the entire state moves together in economic 
development 
the governor said his administration wanted to limit such 
programs to 10 percent of the total 
but duke elected after campaigning against setaside programs 
said the bill would discriminate against white contractors 
he claimed roemers transportation program could cost up to 200 
million more if setaside programs were used he said 
duke a 38yearold republican from suburban new orleans quit 
the klan in 1980 in a leadership dispute and set up his own 
organization the national association for the advancement of white 
people 
rep sherman copelin a black democrat from new orleans said the 
bill had been drawn with the help of the associated general 
contractors the states largest contracting group 
according to the bill the governor would be required to have a 
study committee determine whether black contractors have been 
discriminated against the legislature would be in charge of drawing 
up guidelines for the setaside program if the study found 
discrimination 
if lawmakers did not act by june 30 roemer could impose 
guidelines by executive order 
the us supreme court earlier this year struck down a richmond 
va plan to set aside 30 percent of the value of public works 
projects for companies at least halfowned by minorities because the 
city could not prove minority contractors were being discriminated 
against

archaeologists have begun unearthing the 
remains of a 17thcentury spanish mission that they located in a 
pasture with the help of an airborne heat sensor developed by nasa 
its fantastic says jerry milanich curator in archaeology 
at the university of floridas florida museum of natural history 
i never saw anything so magical in my life he said of the 
computergenerated map that revealed the outlines of what little is 
left of the mission santa fe de toloco 
in the past few weeks teams headed by milanich have unearthed 
what they are convinced are the outlines of the missions three main 
buildings the kitchen the priests residence and the church they 
also have found the missions cemetery 
these relics have been hidden since 1702 when british soldiers 
and their indian allies burned and looted the centuryold santa fe 
de toloco soon ruins were plowed into the soil or covered by 
natural soil buildup 
on christmas eve 1986 a field crew headed by graduate student 
ken johnson stumbled across pottery spikes and clay near the santa 
fe river in alachua county north of the schools campus in 
gainesville using spanish documents they were able to narrow the 
location of santa fe de toloco to within 10 miles 
milanich and researchers contracted with the space remote sensing 
center a national aeronautics and space administrationsupported 
research center in mississippi last april a plane outfitted with a 
heatsensing scanner flew over the site 
computers analyzed the sites radiated heat to differentiate 
surrounding soil from clay and other early construction materials 
which absorb heat differently they then created a color image which

authorities ordered about 2000 people to stay 
away from their homes monday as firefighters helplessly stood 
watching a butane fire that started when a train derailed and a tank 
car exploded 
police asked residents of 1500 homes within a half mile of the 
derailment to evacuate after 21 csx cars jumped a conrail track 
south of downtown near the bf goodrich chemical plant sunday 
evening the fire spread briefly to the goodrich loading dock 
prompting the evacuation of workers 
no one was seriously injured officials said 
the university of akron as well as akron public and parochial 
schools were closed monday and metropolitan bus service was 
canceled because the city bus garage is near the derailment 
businesses in the area of the explosion shut down 
a csx crew used a crane to begin pulling derailed cars upright 
but fire chief george romanoski said firefighters could do nothing 
about the exploded tank car except to let it burn out on its own 
fires that started at a valve on an adjacent car and beneath a third 
car were out he said 
mary noble 83 who was awakened by her landlord and a police 
officer as she slept sunday in her akron apartment waited patiently 
but nervously in a school cafeteria monday as two small fires 
continued to burn 
im calm now but inside im worried she said 
cathy miglin a kenmore high school employee who was helping the 
evacuees heard the blast from her home two miles west of the 
derailment 
i heard the explosion and all the sirens and the dog next door 
was howling so we knew something was up she said and then we 
saw that the sky was all lit up 
the flames shot at least 500 feet in the air just like a big 
mushroom going up and the sirens just started coming from 
everywhere 
thirteen people were treated at akron general hospital most 
suffering from inhalation of smoke and fumes 
rl leckie spokesman for csx transportation in jacksonville 
fla said nine of the derailed cars were carrying butane one of 
the tankers was ruptured by the derailment and immediately caught 
fire he said 
claire austin a spokeswoman for the federal railroad 
administration in washington said conrail last inspected the track 
on feb 23 the fra last checked in late february 1988 
no problems were found last week and only minor variances 
were found in the 1988 inspection ms austin said 
conrail is required to inspect the track twice a week 
ms austin said the five fra inspectors and fras regional 
director at the scene have spoken with the engineer alcohol and 
drug tests have been conducted but the results were not immediately 
known 
there didnt seem to be any problem with that from what they 
saw she said the cause of the derailment remains unknown 
evacuees were sent to the university of akrons james a rhodes 
arena and many went to stay with relatives and friends officials 
said 
lewis said many of the derailed cars carried nonhazardous 
materials including vegetable oil clay and sand one car carried 
butadiene which may produce hazardous smoke when burned but it was 
too far from the burning cars to cause concern mayor don 
plusquellic said

us rep donald lukens said monday he 
was set up and solicited for money in connection with an alleged 
sexual incident involving a teenage girl 
in an interview at his district office in this western ohio city 
lukens denied the charge of contributing to the unruliness and 
delinquency of a child a 16yearold girl a grand jury in columbus 
indicted the 58yearold republican on the misdemeanor charge 
thursday 
i was approached for money on the basis of the general 
allegation he said i said hey im not going to pay any 
money nothing happened 
lukens said he was asked for money more than once with the 
threat that those involved would go to police and the news media if 
he refused he questioned why police were not immediately notified 
following the alleged incident 
i believe that i was set up and i know for a fact because i 
was the person they asked for money lukens said 
he would not specify who approached him for money adding that 
there are some things he cant discuss because they will be the 
basis of his defense 
in an interview with a dayton television station lukens denied 
having sex with the girl 
did you have sex with the girl the interviewer asked 
no lukens replied 
lukens who is divorced did not deny he knew the girl and said 
he met her on occasion 
lukens made his remarks during interviews with reporters 
following a meeting with local supporters and constituents in 
greenville which is about 40 miles northwest of dayton earlier 
monday lukens met with supporters at a private residence in 
middletown and gave interviews to newspapers in hamilton and eaton 
they were his first public appearances in his district since the 
investigation was revealed nearly a month ago 
im back at work lukens said promising to complete his 
twoyear congressional term which expires in 1990 
lukens charged that the news media assumed he was guilty and 
failed to investigate the moral character of the people involved 
he also accused columbus television station wsyx of delaying 
broadcast of a videotaped meeting he had with the girls mother for 
five weeks to take advantage of a ratings week wsyx news director 
carl twentier denied the charge 
lukens said he has not seen the secretly recorded videotape 
which shows him meeting with anna coffman last november in a 
columbus fastfood restaurant 
in the videotape broadcast by wsyx on feb 1 ms coffman asks 
why lukens was messing around with her daughter she alleged 
that lukens had a sexual relationship with her daughter on two 
occasions once when the girl was 13 the daughter is now 17 
in the videotape lukens responds that he thought the daughter 
was an adult 
the grand jury indicted lukens in connection with an act of 
sexual intercourse that allegedly occurred last november when the 
girl was 16 prosecutors said they have evidence money was involved 
if convicted lukens could be sentenced to 180 days in jail and a 
1000 fine

the house ethics committee monday began an 
exhaustive review of a special counsels investigative report on 
alleged ethics violations of speaker jim wright and members said 
they would be in no rush to finish 
the panels closeddoor deliberations are being held in strict 
secrecy and committee chairman rep julian dixon dcalif said he 
expects no announcement of any results until the week of march 13 
i think everyones getting their questions answered said 
rep john t myers of indiana the panels senior republican after 
seven hours of deliberations we are dealing with very sensitive 
matters here peoples careers 
the committee is scheduled to meet again tuesday wednesday and 
thursday and panel members have been asked to keep their calendars 
clear next week as well 
dixon said the special outside counsel hired to investigate the 
wright matter richard j phelan is presenting his findings count 
by count members can then ask questions and wrights lawyer 
william c oldaker can comment on the evidence he said 
wright dtexas is alleged in a sixcount resolution to have 
abused his office for personal financial gain the charges include 
using a congressional aide to help compile a book on which wright 
earned some 55000 in royalties and using a condominium in his 
hometown of fort worth without paying full market value 
he also is alleged to have improperly lobbied federal officials 
on behalf of texas savings and loan institutions and lobbied for a 
gas venture in which he had a financial stake 
wright has steadfastly denied violating any law or rule of the 
house although he has conceded he might have done some things 
differently if he had them to do over 
the committee has spent nearly 1 million on the probe which 
began in june most of it for phelans legal fees his report to the 
committee runs about 450 pages and includes only findings of fact on 
the six allegations against wright but no recommendations on 
whether the facts warrant disciplinary action said one committee 
source speaking only on condition of anonymity 
the source said phelan has used the broadest possible 
interpretation of each of the six counts and has in some cases 
divided them into subcategories that enabled phelan for example 
to go into wrights financial dealings with fort worth business 
partner george mallick under the heading of looking into the 
condominium which was owned by mallicks son 
myers said the presence of oldaker was unusual but he added 
were just trying to be as generous as we can committee rules 
provide that a member who is the subject of an investigation can be 
given a chance to comment on the allegations 
the process is adversarial in the sense that both sides will 
represent their points of view dixon said the facts are always 
subject to interpretation 
oldaker had no comment on the probe as he entered the hearing 
room except to say the process has gone on for a long period of 
time we hope for an early resolution 
the committees current deliberations are the culmination of a 
process known as a preliminary inquiry the panels equivalent of a 
grand jury investigation 
dixon said the committee will hear the presentations of the two 
lawyers and discuss the findings then decide whether to take the 
next step in the process issuing a statement of alleged violation 
which is akin to an indictment 
wright has not been given a copy of phelans report and was not 
scheduled to attend the deliberations dixon said

public health is not threatened by 
aflatoxin a cancercausing substance found in part of the nations 
corn supply agricultural leaders said monday 
directors of agriculture from key farm states said recent reports 
that corn containing aflatoxin had escaped detection and gotten into 
food products were misleading 
consumers need not be afraid that tainted products are in the 
food chain said dale cochran iowa secretary of agriculture 
yes im quite convinced that the supply is being checked 
quite carefully 
the heat and drought of 1988 provided ideal conditions for 
development of the fungus that produces aflatoxin which has been 
linked to the development of liver cancer in laboratory rats 
the wall street journal reported last week that aflatoxintainted 
corn is moving through the nations food supply 
the newspaper which conducted a fivemonthinvestigation 
reported that inadequate sampling and unreliable testing of corn 
after the harvest contributed to the distribution of tainted grain 
but illinois agriculture director larry werries said tests by the 
us food and drug administration showed no aflatoxin contamination 
of finished food products in his state 
werries said his own agencys tests of milk samples also showed 
no contamination dairy cattle are fed corn and he said that should 
be the first place it shows 
the limit for aflatoxin is 20 parts per billion for corn that 
will be used in food production or will be fed to dairy cattle said 
werries under current regulations corn with higher levels of 
aflatoxin may be fed to meatproducing animals such as cattle and 
hogs 
so even if a farmer sold corn with more than 20 parts per billion 
of aflatoxin the elevator likely has an outlet for it said 
werries 
in my opinion the system works he said 
cochran said tests by his agency in iowa showed 98 percent of the 
milk samples were safe milk from three farms was tainted so it was 
not distributed and other milk sales by those farms was stopped he 
said 
missouris director of agriculture charles kruse said there 
probably was no greater problem with aflatoxin in his state this 
year than in some previous years 
there is a greater awareness than perhaps there was five or 
10 years ago said kruse there is certainly more testing going 
on now 
the journal said some experts do not believe the government or 
the grain industry can deal adequately with the aflatoxin outbreak 
of 1988 
there is just no way of policing a massive system of commerce 
and trade plant pathologist david wilson of the university of 
georgia told the newspaper 
officials at the worlds largest cereal mill quaker oats co in 
cedar rapids iowa say they test incoming corn for aflatoxin 
its the most serious thing we look for plant manager 
kenneth dykes told the journal i dont think farmers and 
elevators do screen for aflatoxin 
but steve wentworth an illinois farmer and president of the 
national corn growers association said there is extensive aflatoxin 
testing by both the government and private industry 
and he said it was misleading to suggest that farmers are 
ignorant of the problem or are willing to try to sell corn that 
exceeds federal limits for aflatoxin 
farmers are consumers and want the nations food supply to be 
as safe as possible wentworth said

here is a transcript of president bushs 
remarks monday at andrews air force base in maryland as he returned 
from his trip to asia 
well let me just say that it is great to be back home again at 
the conclusion of a productive and rewarding trip to japan china 
and korea a trip which underscored that america is and will remain 
a pacific power 
there were important symbols 
ill never forget that solemn moment when we paid our nations 
respect to the late emperor of japan the warm and genuine 
handshakes between old friends in beijings great hall of the 
people the opportunity for the freely elected leader of a 
200yearold nation to address the freely elected legislature of a 
blossoming democracy korea 
but we laid out an important substantive course thoughtful and 
candid conversations with world leaders over 20 of them leaders 
from asia china japan korea thailand singapore india 
pakistan and the philippines and our allies from europe france 
belgium italy portugal turkey germany and spain and meeting 
leaders from the middle east egypt israel and jordan and the 
presidents of brazil nigeria and zaire 
and so i return tonight pleased with the progress made toward 
lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with our allies and 
friends 
of course differences remain 
work is yet to be done opening foreign markets to us 
competition continuing to encourage the growth of democracy and 
human rights and strengthening of our alliances 
but common ground was found 
in japan we have our most important asian ally and one of our 
largest trading partners 
our discussions there emphasized the responsibilities we share in 
the field of defense 
but we also spoke of ways in which the worlds strongest and 
most innovative economies can cooperate more closely to fuel growth 
not only at home but also in the developing world 
in china i talked with the leaders that id known nearly 15 
years ago when i served as chief of the us liaison office 
and it is clear from my trip that china approaches its thaw with 
the soviets with caution and realism 
we agreed that the soviets must be judged not by their rhetoric 
but by their actions 
such as whether the soviet union actually draws down its military 
forces along chinas border and persists in encouraging vietnam to 
completely withdraw from cambodia 
we also agreed that after cambodia has achieved a genuine end to 
vietnams occupation free elections should be held under a 
coalition government led by prince sihanouk with whom i met in 
beijing 
the united states remains committed to a result that precludes a 
return to power by the khmer rouge and the chinese leaders 
appreciate our concern and are willing to work toward a peaceful 
coalition 
on the final leg of my journey i went to korea where i saw both 
democracy and economic liberty work in a country whose security is 
assured by our joint efforts and vigilance 
thirty years ago such progress was unimaginable and it stands as 
a testament to the korean people and our commitment to them 
from these four days of intensive discussions i return with one 
especially vivid impression 
the world looks to america for leadership not just because were 
militarily strong not just because we have the worlds largest 
economy but because the ideas we have championed are now dominant 
freedom and democracy openness and the prosperity that derives from 
individual initiatives in the free marketplace 
these ideas once thought to be strictly american have now 
become the goals of mankind all over asia 
the success of our nations foreign policy is the responsibility 
of the president with the counsel and support of the congress 
and this important trip has only underscored for me what can be 
achieved through a strong and bipartisan working relationship 
between the white house and congress 
im anxious to sit down with congressional leadership to brief 
them on details of these critical visits 
and together we must ensure that this initial success is only a 
first step down a long path of peace and understanding with our 
friends and allies 
if common ground can be found halfway around the world in the 
shadow of mount fuji in the historic great hall of the people or 
the garden of koreas blue house surely it can be found at home 
among men and women of common purpose 
we must respect each other and join together as one in pursuing a 
foreign policy that ensures the security of our country its 
economic opportunity and freedom and individual rights around the 
world 
its great to be home 
god bless the united states of america 
thank you all very much

president bush returned home monday night from 
a fiveday asian voyage that he pronounced a productive and 
rewarding journey and moved to take personal command of the 
struggle to win confirmation for john tower as defense secretary 
in a prepared statement he read at the foot of the ramp to air 
force one bush said his trip to japan china and south korea 
demonstrated that the united states is and will remain a pacific 
power 
its great to be home god bless the united states of 
america bush said in the chilly darkness at andrews air force 
base in suburban maryland vice president dan quayle was on hand to 
welcome the new president back from his first overseas voyage 
in his brief statement the president said he had held 
thoughtful and candid conversations with world leaders 
including the several he met with in japan where he attended the 
funeral of emperor hirohito from there he went to china for two 
days followed by a fivehour stopover in seoul 
i return tonight pleased with the progress made toward lasting 
and mutually beneficial relationships bush said he said work 
remains to be done toward encouraging the growth of democracy 
working for human rights strengthening international alliances and 
opening foreign markets to american goods 
bush made no direct reference to the tower nomination in his 
airport statement 
but in comments to reporters just before his plane touched down 
he said no one has challenged his qualifications to head the 
pentagon 
i dont have any predictions nor do i plan to except to say i 
havent wavered one iota and i dont intend to he said 
in assessing his trip bush also addressed relations between 
china and the soviet union although he didnt mention mikhail s 
gorbachevs springtime visit to beijing 
china approaches its thaw with the soviets with caution and 
realism we agreed that the soviets must be judged not by their 
rhetoric but by their actions such as whether the soviet union 
actually draws down its military forces along chinas border and 
persists in encouraging vietnam to completely withdraw from 
cambodia bush said 
bush also said he agreed with the chinese that free elections 
should be held in cambodia after vietnam occupation ends under a 
coalition government led by prince sihanoukthe united states 
remains committed by a result that precludes a return to power by 
the khmer rouge and the chinese leaders appreciate our concern and 
are willing to work toward a peaceful coalition he said 
tower has been plagued by allegations of drinking and womanizing 
as well as possible conflicts of interest stemming from the hundreds 
of thousands of dollars he received as a defense industry consultant 
in recent years 
asked whether towers weekend vow of alcohol abstinence would 
help his chances bush laughed and said i dont know 
white house chief of staff john sununu was meeting with 
republican senators to discuss the nomination shortly after air 
force one landed in washington 
aides said the president intended to spare no effort in a bid to 
prevail in the first highstakes political struggle of his 
administration he invited senate majority leader george mitchell to 
the white house for breakfast on tuesday the first of several 
planned sessions with democrats whose votes will be crucial to 
towers chances 
towers appointment was rejected 119 in a party line vote last 
week by the armed services committee and the full senate is 
expected to take up the appointment beginning on wednesday 
bush planned to meet at the white house with 12 democratic 
senators beginning shortly after 8 am tuesday morning in a bid to 
get them to keep an open mind and build support for tower said 
fitzwater 
the presidents aides say they are hopeful that towers unusual 
weekend pledge to abstain from drinking alcohol if confirmed would 
help boost his chances 
fitzwater said that should take care of the drinking 
situation that many senators said was bothering them 
but prospects for confirmation still appeared difficult 
defense was also the main subject in bushs speech earlier monday 
to the national assembly in seoul the president vowed to keep us 
troops stationed there so long as they were requested by the 
government to preserve stability 
on another subject bush voiced concerns over the ussouth 
korea trade imbalance both in his speech to the lawmakers and after 
a meeting with president roh taewoo he suggested that south korea 
do more to lower its barriers to us goods 
korea has benefited from the us open markets we must 
expect fair access to the markets here bush said after the 
meeting with roh 
roh voiced support for free markets throughout the world he said 
he and bush agreed to work on problems resulting from the rapid 
expansion of economic relations between our two countries 
returning to the west bush left a volatile climate in south 
korea with antiamerican protesters and police clashing in the 
streets of at least six cities 
in seoul about 700 radical students shouting bush go home 
threw firebombs and rocks at police around dongguk university in an 
abortive attempt to march on the us embassy about three miles away 
students burned effigies of bush and roh taewoo at a rally on 
the school grounds and leaders charged that washington keeps troops 
in south korea to enforce its rule 
police arrested about 15 prominent dissidents shouting no bush 
visit who had tried to assemble near the downtown embassy 
the antiamerican violence prompted tight security for bushs 
brief visit and his trip from a military airfield to town for his 
meetings was made by helicopter

two scholars think king arthurs men gathered in 
scotland not southwest england and believe they were knights of 
the round room not the round table the publisher of burkes 
peerage said monday 
harold brooksbaker who presides over the directory of britains 
aristocracy said norma goodrich of claremont calif and robert 
mitchell of miami are convinced by their research in the area that 
the knights assembled near stirling scotland 
brooksbaker in a press statement said the scholars believe 
what became known as the round table actually was a rotunda and the 
mistake was made in translating the word roonde apparently 
early french as an adjective rather than a noun meaning rotunda 
the stones are believed buried near the river carron where they 
were used to repair a dam in 1743 and one was found at the time to 
have been carved said the publisher who offered few specifics to 
support his case 
king arthur guinevere sir galahad and sir lancelot are part of 
a story that developed in the 12th century apparently based on a 
romanbritish leader who fought saxon invaders in the 6th century 
arthurs legend was embroidered through the ages and immortalized 
by writers sir thomas malory and th white and the poet tennyson 
many say the heroic king was buried in glastonbury southwest 
england the village of tintagel also in the southwest has a long 
association with arthurian legend 
an archaelogical site at yeovil in somerset southwest england 
is suggested as a possible camelot the capital of arthurs kingdom 
so if arthur really lived in scotland its a sharp change of 
direction 
test drilling has been done at the stirling site and excavation 
will cost more than 260000 brooksbaker said 
in october ms goodrich said research by brooksbakers 
publishing house proved one of arthurs forts was at ayr scotland 
which burkes said was known as camelot ayr is 55 miles southwest 
of stirling 
ms goodrich is described as the author of the books merlin 
named for arthurs sorcerer and king arthur mitchell is 
described as having conducted extensive research on the subject for 
more than six years

the head of a black forest chemical 
company suspected of helping libya build a poison gas plant will 
resign at the end of next month the company announced monday night 
juergen hippenstielimhausen will leave his post as director of 
the imhausenchemie company of lahr spokesman moritz hunzinger told 
reporters 
hippenstiel did not appear at the news conference and has not 
been seen in public since midjanuary when suspicions mounted that 
his firm organized construction and outfitting of a chemical weapons 
plant in rabta libya 
no charges have been filed against anyone at imhausen or other 
west german firms said to have played a role in building the plant 
which libyan officials say is intended to produce medicines 
imhausen officials said last month that hippenstiel fled with his 
family after receiving death threats but he is believed to have 
since returned to west germany 
his resignation effective march 31 appears to be the result of 
pressure from the federal research and development ministry which 
refused to pay the firm for three projects it has under contract 
with imhausen as long as hippenstiel remained in charge 
the local parliamentary representative and business council also 
demanded that hippenstiel step down 
federal authorities have been investigating us allegations that 
imhausen played a key role in the rabta plant but they say no 
evidence has been uncovered that could stand up in court 
officials conceded privately they fear any incriminating evidence 
may have been taken out of the country prior to the investigations 
which began months after us officials first brought up the 
imhausen name with west german authorities 
company managing director hansjoachim renner attempted suicide 
in midfebruary and remains hospitalized in critical condition 
hunzinger said uwe kunze director of colognes phospholipid 
company would take over hippenstiels job

black african leaders on monday attacked 
suggestions that the un peacekeeping force in namibia may buy or 
lease military equipment from south africa squabbles over 
purchasing have delayed funding approval 
on april 1 un peacekeepers plan to begin implementing a 
oneyear plan for namibias independence from 74 years of south 
african rule 
un officials have said they need make purchases from south 
africa which lies on namibias southern border to keep down the 
cost of the mission that has a proposed budget of 416 million 
ambassador isack stanislaus gorerazvo mudenge of zimbabwe 
representing the nonaligned movement said monday no need exists to 
depend on south africa for military equipment he said he accepted 
that south africa dominates the economy of the region and said 
peacekeepers could buy anything except military equipment from that 
whitedominated nation 
zambian ambassador peter dingiswayo zuze representing the black 
african frontline states joined mudenge at the news conference 
the frontline states border on south africa or are particularly 
concerned with events there they are zimbabwe zambia botswana 
mozambique tanzania and angola 
mudenge said dependence on south africa may be unavoidable in the 
early stages but we expect them the un officials to plan so 
as to minimize that dependence 
the general assemblys finance committee has been deadlocked over 
the procurement issue since last week 
the general assembly has had to hold up approving the funding for 
the namibia force 
frontline states insist on inserting language into the funding 
resolution referring to un embargoes on buying military equipment 
oil or other goods from south africa 
the united states britain and france oppose including such 
language

a comprehensive agreement to clean up the 
nations most contaminated nuclear weaponsproduction site was 
signed monday by the federal government and washington state but 
the pact had no guarantee that money will be available to complete 
the job at the hanford nuclear reservation 
at a signing ceremony state and federal officials said the 
landmark agreement will provide a clear road map for 
cleaning up the 570 square mile reservation in washington state and 
serve as a model for other energy department weapons plants 
the department also made public monday documents that estimated 
five billion cubic yards of hazardous solid and liquid wastes both 
radioactive and toxic have been disposed of at hanford 
the documents said that abovebackground concentrations of 
such substances as tritium iodine129 uranium and cyanide have 
been found in the groundwater beneath the reservation and may 
threaten the nearby columbia river 
these materials have toxic carcinogenic mutagenic or 
teratogenic effects on humans and other life forms the documents 
said adding that there continue to be releases of hazardous 
compounds 
under the agreement announced monday the department has promised 
to seek 28 billion for the hanford clean up over five years but 
the appropriation has yet to receive the blessing of the white house 
budget office and will eventually have to be approved by congress 
after five years the agreement calls for the state and the 
energy department to sit down and come up with additional requests 
to finance continued cleanup which by department estimates could 
cost 57 billion 
we are extremely satisfied with the money provisions said 
washington gov booth gardner 
key provisions of the hanford action cleanup action plan 
include 
an accelerated program for actually cleaning up the reservation 
over 30 years rather than 50 years as originally envisioned 
specific cleanup milestones doe could be fined up to 10000 
per week for failing to meet the milestones 
clear delineation of duties between the state the energy 
department and the federal environmental protection agency 
an agreement which the justice department has agreed to 
allowing the state or members of the general public to enforce the 
agreement by filing a lawsuit if necessary 
in addition the federal government has agreed to provide 
washington state 29 million over three years to fund the states 
oversight role 
the agreement was reached after more than a year of negotiations 
and amid threats that the state would go to court if negotiations 
failed 
besides being the most contaminated of the energy departments 16 
nuclear weaponsproductions sites the hanford reservation is 
expected to be the most costly to clean up and take the longest 
j winston porter an assistant epa administration said the 
hanford site offers the toughest problems of any site 
it will be the largest clean up in terms of time cost and 
complexity said porter 
stored at hanford is more than 60 percent of the nations 
highlevel radioactive waste generated by weapons programs dating 
back to world war ii 
scientists at the reservation worked on the bomb that was dropped 
at nagasaki in the 1950s hanford was one of the largest weapons 
production complexes 
at present only one commercial nuclear power plant is operating 
at the reservation and the department has announced plans to phase 
out all weapons production activities at the site

industrial workers have formed the first 
independent bluecollar union in postwar hungary using polands 
banned solidarity as a model and intending to campaign for trade 
union pluralism 
about 500 men and women launched workers solidarity during a 
meeting saturday and the group plans to hold its founding meeting 
in may the official mti news agency reported monday 
the union blamed the ruling communist party for failing to live 
up to one of its fundamental tenets the protection of workers 
rights 
about half a dozen independent trade unions have sprung up in 
hungary over the past year to date however they have been 
dominated by whitecollar workers rather than factory labor 
the new union was formed amid a growing economic crisis in 
hungary where living standards are falling as inflation reaches 20 
percent 
meanwhile a veteran communist party member asked a partys 
district committee in budapest at an a weekend public debate that it 
should take a stand in favor of the oneparty system the daily 
magyar nemzet said monday 
another party conservative gyula sandor secretary of a local 
party chapter comprised of old age pensioners claimed an open 
anticommunist aggression has been going on in hungary 
a section of the intellectual aristocracy who is well off is 
waging an open struggle against us communists magyar nemzet

airlines worldwide were advised to check the 
cargo doors of their boeing 747s as federal investigators focused 
monday on the cargo door latch system of a united jumbo jet that 
ripped open at 22000 feet 
us transportation secretary samuel skinner said he thinks 
its very important that we not jump to conclusions until that 
report on the investigation is done 
the preliminary indications of course are that the cargo 
door opened or at least the skin peeled around the door but lets 
wait until the board reports then well know finally what went 
on skinner said in an interview monday with abcs good morning 
america 
united airlines announced that it conducted detailed examinations 
of all cargo doors in every plane in its fleet seven doors required 
repairs the airline said but spokesman rob doughty said none of 
the repairs was urgent 
the items we repaired did not affect operating performance or 
airworthiness he said 
uniteds flight 811 was gaining altitude 100 miles south of here 
after taking off for auckland new zealand early friday when a 
10by20foot section of the fuselage ripped away including the 
right front cargo door 
nine passengers disappeared when 10 seats in the business class 
on the right side were blown out through the gaping hole 
investigators said 
there was no indication from the ground crew or cockpit crew that 
anything was amiss when the cargo door was secured for flight said 
lee dickinson a national transportation safety board investigator 
dickinson said investigators have found no evidence of a bomb 
sabotage or metal fatigue that might have caused the mishap and 
are focusing on and looking at the latching mechanism 
were also trying to get a better handle on these latch pin 
supports and comparing them to others he said 
the cargo bay door closed electrically with eight latching 
mechanisms along the bottom attached to the planes frame as well 
as a latching mechanism and a hook pin on each side dickinson said 
investigators determined sunday that a warning system that would 
have alerted the cockpit crew if the door was not closed properly 
did work dickinson said at the ntsbs news briefing sunday night 
boeing co on sunday advised all airlines to check the cargo 
doors of their 747s and national transportation safety board 
investigators inspected the doors of other united 747s at honolulu 
international airport the next day doughty said 
boeing said it has delivered 712 boeing 747s of all types around 
the world 
what this is from us is by no means interfering or speculating 
on the probable cause of the accident boeing spokesman david 
jiminez said monday its more of a prudent act on our part to 
keep customers appraised of what we know 
united president stephen wolf said an faalicensed mechanic would 
inspect each 747s cargo doors upon arrival and departure and would 
oversee the closing of each cargo door before departure 
in a statement issued from its chicago headquarters united said 
it conducted detailed examinations sunday and monday of more than 
900 cargo doors in its fleet of 399 aircraft including boeing 727s 
737s 747s and dc10s made by mcdonnell douglas corp 
the seven repairs included repairing a 2inch crack in the 
doorframe of a 737 replacing a doorstop on a 737 replacing two 
small brackets on a 747 latch mechanism and adjusting a dc10 motor 
the statement said 
all of these repairs would have been performed in the 
normal course of maintenance the statement said of more than 
1700 daily united flights only two delays and one cancellation 
were necessary 
meanwhile doughty hailed the pilot of the crippled jet capt 
david m cronin as a hero for controlling the craft 
cronin and the other 17 crewmembers of the plane have not been 
allowed to talk to the media doughty said 
although we have nothing but praise for capt cronin and the 
rest the crew we dont want anyone to draw conclusions about the 
crash based on a brief interview he said 
unions representing the flight and ground crews of flight 811 are 
working with investigators in an effort to reassure the public 
following last fridays incident union leaders said monday 
instead of seeing who might be blamed its our primary concern 
to find out what happened and make sure we can keep it from 
happening again said sam poomaihealani assistant general 
chairman of district 141 international association of machinists 
the union represents all ground employes of united 
a threeday search by navy and coast guard ships and aircraft 
resulted on the recovery of 57 pieces of debris that fell from the 
plane incuding airline seat cushions an overhead compartment a 
section of fuselage and personal itmes including a teddy bear 
not recovered was the cargo door 
obviously if we had the door it would be very helpful to us 
dickinson said but said he was confident other information will 
pinpoint the cause of the accident 
of the 354 people aboard the plane incuding 18 crewmembers 27 
were treated at honolulu hospitals mostly for minor injuries caused 
by flying debris one was released from the hospital monday leaving 
two still hospitalized

miami ap two firefighters were killed monday in the battle 
against a wildfire in central florida while other blazes scorched 
miles of everglades sawgrass and threatened a major power line that 
serves the miami area 
the two volunteer firefighters from bushnell about 45 miles west 
of orlando had just arrived at the scene of a milelong grass fire 
in the median strip of interstate 75 when a tractortrailer slammed 
into their smokeobscured pickup crushing both men the florida 
highway patrol said 
paul j reid 20 was dead on the scene while ervin w fort 33 
was airlifted to bayfront medical center in st petersburg where he 
was pronounced dead the patrol said 
the truck driver denver lewis 31 of clarkton mo was not 
seriously injured sumter county sheriffs capt james fussell said 
the accident two miles south of bushnell tied up southbound traffic 
for about three hours 
the firefighters were the first to die so far this wildfire 
season the last time a death occurred fighting a wildfire was more 
than four years ago state forestry officials said 
a fire emergency was declared at midday by officials in both 
broward and palm beach counties just north of miami placing all 
available firefighters on alert 
the largest of the wildfires engulfed 2700 acres of the 
everglades in broward county and was a major concern because it was 
approaching a major transmission line owned by florida power amp 
light forestry officials said 
five to 10 miles of lines were threatened by everglades fires 
near us 27 at the palm beachbroward county line said david 
utley a state forestry duty officer 
stacey shaw a spokeswoman for fpampl said three 500kilovolt 
lines were taken out of service monday morning when fires burned 
into the corridor where they are located 
the utility reactivated the lines after the blaze moved away from 
them early monday evening state forester peter burke said 
firefighters were depending on weather conditions to help contain 
the everglades blaze after withdrawing from the area monday evening 
burke said 
it will probably be burning overnight but we expect it will be 
under control as the humidity rises the winds die down and the 
temperatures get cooler burke said i expect well be mopping 
up hopefully tommorrow

offices in tallahassee said the everglades fire was one of about 
200 wildfires reported since friday some were in palm beach county 
where we had a problem with arson he said 
the annual bout with brushfires started much earlier this year in 
south florida because rainfall has been about half the normal amount 
since november 
the miami area has received 7 inches of rain since september 
compared with an average rainfall of 24 inches for that period 
according to the national weather service 
a fire which swept through 397 acres of grass and timberlands 
forced the evacuation of some 200 people and closed a highway sunday 
in putnam county in northeast florida 
putnam county sheriffs sgt pat westberry said residents were 
allowed to return home early monday no homes or businesses were 
damaged he said 
arson was believed responsible for that fire said assistant

a bomb killed one person and wounded seven monday at a protest of 
the satanic verses in india and britain said irans order to 
kill author salman rushdie was a fearful example of where 
intolerance may lead 
activists in moscow demonstrated for rushdie outside the iranian 
embassy 
in karachi pakistan a bomb exploded at the british council 
library while it was closed sunday night killing a guard 
at least 18 people have been killed in india and pakistan since 
feb 12 both countries have banned the novel 
syria said it banned the satanic verses which many moslems 
consider blasphemous a month ago and suspended all dealings with 
viking penguin the publisher the information ministry said the ban 
includes any other publishing house that translates or distributes 
the book 
moslem theologians meeting in mecca the holy city of islam 
branded rushdie a heretic and a renegade monday but did not 
endorse murdering him islamic law condemns heretics to death but 
only after they are tried and refuse to repent 
in london the government refused a request by british moslems to 
extend the blasphemy law to all religions it now covers only the 
anglican faith 
rushdie 41 was born into a moslem family in bombay india but 
has become a british citizen and does not actively practice 
religion the writer has been in hiding and under heavy police guard 
since ayatollah ruhollah khomeini ordered his death 
he has apologized for any distress the satanic verses caused 
moslems but iran rejected the apology 
a senior viking penguin editor attending an emergency meeting in 
london of the writers guild of great britain said monday hardback 
copies of the novel were selling so well that a paperback edition 
due out in august may be delayed for crude commercial reasons 
he denied reports that viking penguin might cancel the paperback 
edition to appease moslems 
khomeini irans 88yearold revolutionary patriarch ordered his 
followers feb 14 to kill rushdie for blaspheming islam and the 
prophet mohammed iranian clerics put a price of 52 million on the 
authors head 
nigerias supreme council of moslems said monday it supports the 
death sentence a moslem student group in africas most populous 
country also demanded action against nigerian author wole soyinka 
the 1986 nobel literature laureate for defending his fellow writer 
about 300 moslems demonstrated at the british consulate in kaduna 
in the moslemdominated north they carried placards condemning 
rushdie and soyinka one of which said soyinka must die 
rushdie got support monday from about 15 unofficial political 
activists and journalists in moscow who shouted shame on khomeini 
shame on islam outside the iranian embassy 
soviet media have published reports from abroad about the 
controversy but have not commented editorially and the kremlin has 
said nothing 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze touring the middle east 
met with khomeini in tehran on sunday irans official news agency 
indicated they did not mention rushdie or the satanic verses 
a statement distributed by the moscow protesters said while 
all the civilized world is outraged by the death sentence the 
soviet government as usual remains silent 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain was in paris for a 
summit with the french president francois mitterrand and told a 
news conference that defending rushdie is a fundamental matter of 
freedom of speech 
we cannot have other people inciting their own citizens to 
murder one of our citizens and on that we had to be very firm 
she said 
irans parliament has scheduled a vote for tuesday on whether to 
break relations with britain 
mitterrand told the journalists in an affair of this kind 
when dogmatism and fanaticism create a totally irrational situation 
one must of course expect anything 
michel rocard the french premier said any demonstrations urging 
violence against rushdie would result in criminal charges 
british chief delegate henry steel told the un human rights 
commission in geneva the khomeini incitement to murder was a 
fearful example of where intolerance may lead and raises 
grave issues for the 43nation commission at which iran has 
observer status

jammukashmir state where a crowd was trying to enforce a strike to

more than half the nation may be 
temporarily prohibited from using south carolinas hazardous waste 
landfill beginning wednesday state health officials said monday 
gov carroll campbell said last month that he would shut the 
states borders march 1 to states seeking to dispose of hazardous 
waste in south carolina that they wont dispose of themselves 
as of monday 27 states had not responded to the state department 
of health and environmental controls request for information needed 
to enact campbells order officials said 
the order affects the massive gsx hazardous waste landfill in 
sumter county east of columbia which now holds close to a billion 
pounds of hazardous waste about 70 percent of it from out of state 
the site is one of only two commercial hazardous waste landfills in 
the southeast and accepts roughly 135000 tons of chemical garbage 
annually the other site is in alabama 
state health officials sent letters to all 50 states and puerto 
rico informing them of campbells order and asking for information 
on their waste handling laws by feb 15 
but by monday afternoon only 23 states had responded 
thirtythree states puerto rico and the district of columbia 
used the facility in 1987 and south carolina officials said some 
states may not be responding because they will not be affected by 
the order 
but until they know about the states policies all states that 
dont respond will be banned said hartsill truesdale head of the 
health agencys hazardous waste division 
of the states that have responded eight or nine have been 
tentatively put on the list to be banned which will be presented to 
campbell for approval 
the list could change before wednesdays deadline or even 
afterwards as new information is received truesdale said 
campbells staff initially said they expected the ban would fall 
on nine states north carolina florida massachusetts rhode 
island pennsylvania new jersey kentucky louisiana and kansas 
they estimated those states accounted for about 40 percent of the 
waste going to gsx 
truesdale would not comment monday on individual states and said 
the states now listed are not necessarily those suggested earlier by 
the governors office 
campbell speaking from the national governors association 
conference in washington said governors from north carolina 
florida and other states had approached him about his order 
he said that states would have to certify they had no impediments 
to disposal within their own borders or that the repeal of such 
impediments was imminent in order to be allowed to continue burying 
waste in south carolina 
our policy has to be flexible enough to work with a state that 
is genuinely moving to eliminate prohibitions campbell said 
but he said i look for us to reach a point where there will 
be some states that will be cut off

for the first time since 1984 herbicides 
might be used again this year or next in national forests in 
california to protect growth of commercial timber a forest service 
official said monday 
at the same time ray weinmann regional timber management 
director said he expected a legal challenge by zealots over 
concern for possible threats to water supplies humans and wildlife 
such challenges currently under appeal have stalled forest 
herbicide use in washington and oregon 
production in the california region could drop an average of 
about 20 percent without herbicide use weinmann said he said the 
california region represents annual production of about 1718 
billion board feet a board foot is a unit of measure equal to a 
board 1 foot square and 1 inch thick 
we will limit the health risk to acceptable levels we 
believe the risks are well within acceptable limits he said 
the decision is based on an environmental analysis of all the 
factors relating to herbicide use 
the 50000 acres slated for annual herbicide applications are 
cuttimber country and forests burned in wildfires he said 
promising that herbicides will only be used where other treatment 
methods cannot do the job effectively 
weinmann demonstrating the level of favored herbicides produced 
a spray container of weedbgon a consumer product but printed 
material handed reporters made clear that the service wasnt ruling 
out the use of atrazine and 24d both under suspicion as possible 
cancercausing agents 
use of these agents said the reports would be lastchoice 
and limited to sites where no other alternative will meet 
management objectives 
failure to take the described tough measures against competing 
vegetation can cost as much as 300 million to 400 million board feet 
of lumber annually he estimated 
the idea is to control certain clovers brush and weeds that rob 
trees of nutrition in a national forestbased industry that last 
year produced enough lumber to erect a city the size of san 
francisco said weinmann 
before the moratorium in 1984 herbicides had been used in the 
california national forests since the mid1960s the forest service 
manages 20 million acres of california forest land about a third in 
commercial wood product production lumber companies pay to harvest 
wood from national forests 
we know there is going to be a challenge he said there 
are some people who very sincerely and honestly believe that 
herbicides are a poison that should not be used and they are going 
to take whatever aggressive actions they believe they should we 
have to deal with them when they come up 
he called such people zealots

leaders of the nations largest group of 
school administrators voted monday to urge principals around the 
country to avoid programs which force commercials into the classroom 
we know selling junk food in the cafeteria is bad nutrition 
and we know its bad education to bring commercials into the 
classroom scott thomson executive director of the national 
association of secondary school principals said after the 180 vote 
by the groups board of directors 
the board voted to urge schools not to participate in ventures 
disguising commercials as learning programs and to oppose ads which 
students must watch or which replace instruction time 
although the program wasnt mentioned spokesman lew armistead 
said the vote was a reaction to plans for channel one a daily 
12minute news show including up to two minutes of ads 
we think its a premature response the program has not even 
been aired said christopher whittle chairman and founder of 
whittle communications lp of knoxville tenn which plans to test 
the show at six schools in early march 
were conducing an entire battery of research to find out what 
educational value it has to find out the effects of commercials if 
any on teenagers he said in a telephone interview 
whittle communications gives schools about 50000 of electronics 
equipment in exchange for an agreement that the satellitecarried 
program will be shown to students every day 
whittle said walter cronkite told the association in 1980 that a 
daily news program should be beamed to high schools 
he said the only question is funding his attempt to do that 
getting major corporations to put up the money failed said 
whittle 
furthermore lets find out whats the alternative plan he 
said meaning how do the critics expect education to be funded if 
new ideas arent allowed to even be tested 
if youre going to get real funding from business business is 
going have to get real results whittle said when you talk 
about small dollars yes maybe business is going to provide it 
when you talk about real dollars its going have to be quidproquo 
partnerships 
thomson a former social studies teacher said his major 
objection at first was the idea of bringing advertisements into the 
classroom but after seeing a preview segment he said he was even 
more set against channel one 
after i reviewed the program i became more concerned about the 
superficiality of the curriculum thomson said 
it results in pop social studies thats not the right way to 
get students to understand concepts and have basic information he 
said

are you ready for a comedy about biggun 
classical composer gustav gus mahler and his friendship with a 
modernday playwright who is not unlike author albert al 
innaurato 
youll get both of them in gus and al innauratos strange 
comic fantasy that opened monday at offbroadways playwrights 
horizons 
innauratos weird tale of timetravel begins in new york 1989 and 
then jumps backwards to vienna 1901 al who is fat 40 and gay has 
fled his problems in the present to help his hero mahler confront 
difficulties in the past 
and mahler does have his troubles an overbearing sister as well 
as a mad housekeeper natalie who is in love with him she is jealous 
of his romancing the bossy alma schindler who later becomes his wife 
much of the bickering between the composer and his female 
entourage in act 1 is tedious mahler or music buffs might find some 
fun in innauratos inside jokes about the composer others may find 
it pretentious especially when the playwright suggests there is a 
similarity between the two artists both according to innaurato 
unappreciated in their own time 
the second act perks up considerably when al meets camillo his 
italian grandfather as a young man before he emigrates to america 
the link between past and future is forged sweetly and with a great 
deal of humor its a fascinating conceit and one that is more 
interesting than the rest of the play 
mark blum padded with stuffing turns the hefty and neurotic 
playwright into an appealing character sam tsoutsouvas as the 
driven composer is a model of the frustrated unfulfilled artist 
but his trio of female tormentors cara duffmaccormick christina 
moore and jennifer van dyck are all variations of the same 
unattractive shrew bradley white turns als ancestor into an 
attractive commonsense individual in contrast to all the loonies 
swirling around him 
still innaurato has a fine sense of the bizarre particularly 
when he is dealing with his frustrated playwright gus and al 
would have been twice as good if only it had concentrated on half 
its title characters

angry mobs across venezuela set fire to 
cars and buses battled police and national guardsmen and looted 
hundreds of stores on monday to protest increases in gasoline prices 
and transportation fares 
the wave of riots injured at least 200 people alone in caracas 
and the guarenas shantytown 30 miles east of the capital a police 
report said rioting broke out in at least seven cities and towns 
and independent reports estimated damage nationwide to be in the 
millions of dollars 
sackings continued in downtown caracas at nightfall and public 
transportation ground to a halt leaving about 100000 commuters 
stranded officials said many employees remained in their offices 
while a pitched battle went on between police and looters 
it is a popular uprising there are riots everywhere they are 
all furious metropolitan police inspector jose lara montilla who 
commanded a police unit armed with shotguns in downtown caracas 
told an associated press reporter 
all 6000 policemen in caracas were mobilized said alex 
martinez deputy police commissioner 
riots were reported across the country and authorities broadcast 
appeals for calm no official figures were available on deaths or 
injuries 
a 32yearold pregnant woman was fatally shot in guarenas 
according to a reporter for the newspaper la voz de guarenas 
quoting police sources who gave no further details 
television showed rioting in maracaibo san cristobal valencia 
and puerto la cruz among other cities 
police helicopters were seen flying over the capital trying to 
disperse rockhurling mobs in the downtown area of el silencio 
site of the ap offices almost all the stores were sacked in the 
twin simon bolivar towers home of several ministries not one shop 
window was left intact 
every single business around here has been sacked and 
destroyed said victor hugo carvajal an ap reporter who has lived 
in venezuela since 1973 it is the worst i have ever seen 
the outburst turned caracas into one solid traffic jam 
by all accounts the violence occurring during the new 
administration of social democratic president carlos andres perez 
was the worst this usually peaceful oilproducing nation has 
suffered in decades 
interior minister alejandro izaguirre warned in a national tv 
address that the government would not tolerate further public 
disorder burning buses and cars lootings and sackings of shops 
are not the expression of a democratic society we will not tolerate 
this he said 
he said the increases were not capricious but mandated by 
necessity the government was compelled to dictate economic 
measures given the seriousness of an unprecedented economic crisis 
the caracas bus terminal of nuevo circo new circus became a 
battlefield between police and mobs officers fired tear gas 
rioters set cars and buses ablaze hundreds of passangers who were 
waiting for transportation to neighboring areas fled in panic 
at nightfall the police had cordoned off the terminal area where 
about 500 buses and taxis daily transport at least 100000 
commuters most of the commuters are workers who live in maracay and 
valencia 
the fury spilled over monday morning as new transport fares went 
into effect in many cases doubling previous bus rates as a result 
of gasoline price increases of more than 100 percent 
the roundtrip fare between guarenas and caracas went up from 16 
to 32 bolivars roughly from 41 cents to 82 cents in monthly 
terms it represents roughly a quarter of the minimum salary 
included in the economic package announced two weeks ago by the 
government of perez inaugurated on feb 2 
the government hopes to end subsidies on such necessities as 
transportation food and housing 
we cannot stand this we are already halfstarving the new 
rates condemn us to eat nothing said carlos rodriguez 45 who 
works in a shop in downtown caracas 
venezuelas economy prosperous during the 1970s is now trapped 
in a deep recession because of persistently weak oil prices and a 
33billion foreign debt 
the country is also set to sign this week a letter of intent with 
the international monetary fund for a 15 billion credit 
around 120 people were injured including 14 policemen when 
looters formed human chains to face national guard units firing 
birdshot from armored cars said reporter igor camacho 
three guardsmen were hurt by rocks thrown by students in merida 
more than 300 miles southwest of caracas stores were trashed and 
vehicles set ablaze 
its an outright battle between students and the national 
guard said ramon suarez a reporter for the newspaper frontera in 
merida home to the 10000 students of the university of the andes 
tanks patrolled the streets 
students took the state governor orlando guttierez prisoner for 
about an hour monday when he approached rioters in an attempt to 
talk with them 
the national guard part of the defense ministry is used for 
internal security 
in maracay 60 miles east of caracas rioting students told 
reporters to stay away or their cars would be burned said orolis 
rodriguez of the newspaper el siglo she said students blocked land 
transport between caracas and maracay threatening to burn buses and 
cars

as riots swept venezuela looters in 
caracas braved police and army units patrolling the streets and 
seized their chance to raid hundreds of stores 
weve got orders to arrest not to kill said a police 
officer but that could change 
the crisis facing the new government of president carlos andres 
perez was the worst in 30 years of democratic rule in venezuela 
hundreds of venezuelans looted stores in downtown caracas blocks 
from government offices breaking windows and carting off 
merchandise ranging from airconditioners to jewelry 
government shouted a young man warning others of the 
approach of a jeepful of rifletoting police 
police fired in the air but looters defied orders to stop and 
continued to rampage they finally scattered into nearby buildings 
as gunfire continued 
no figures emerged on injuries or arrests but a police officer 
estimated at least 100 police were injured by rocks and homemade 
explosives 
television stations estimated 40 civilians were wounded in 
caracas by birdshot fired by police 
one looter carted away a washing machine 
im doing this because everybody else is he said 
the last time i saw this was the 23rd of january 1958 the 
fall of the dictator said german guedes a toothless old man 
pulling on a new pair of shoes inside a building as firing persisted 
outside 
venezuelan strongman gen marcos perez jimenez was toppled in 
1958 leading to 30 years of stable democratic rule 
a woman caught in the cross fire as she tried to get home 
complained that the looters were criminals taking advantage of what 
started out as a protest by students against increased public 
transportation tariffs 
theyre just criminals robbing burning ive never seen 
anything this bad she said crying 
major avenues across the city with buses blazing looked like 
movie scenes of hell fires in poor neighborhoods in the hills on 
the outskirts of the city burned through the afternoon and evening 
sculptor carlos mendoza said residents of one wealthy 
neighborhood stood on street corners and exchanged impressions of 
the violence the first time hed seen people in the neighborhood 
come out of their houses to talk to each other 
police said they expected the government to declare a state of 
emergency but observers said the looting and riots across the 
country caught officials by surprise 
they dont want to send out the national guard because they 
dont want repression said a police officer but as he spoke 
national guard riot troops with plastic shields patrolled a nearby 
street 
the government doesnt know how to respond weve never had 
this kind of thing before said a young man 
when asked what he would do if the situation continued he said 
he would probably join the looters

two brothers accused of masterminding a 1 
billion operation to launder cocaine profits were honest gold 
bullion dealers an attorney said monday after winning postponement 
of their bail hearing 
the lawyer for nazareth andonian told a magistrate that evidence 
indicating the two mens innocence should be considered before bail 
is decided 
us magistrate john kronenberg scheduled the bail hearing for 
next monday 
the government has asked that andonian and his brother vahe be 
held without bail on grounds that they were key figures in an 
international cocaine money laundering scheme centered in the los 
angeles wholesale jewelry mart 
more than 40 persons have been arrested so far in the government 
investigation codenamed polar cap which was revealed last week 
defendants were charged with aiding the distribution of thousands 
of pounds of cocaine by laundering up to 1 billion in cash the 
money packed like bricks and shipped by armored car was generated 
from cocaine sales in los angeles new york houston and other 
cities authorities said 
the complaint alleged the funds were counted deposited in banks 
and wire transferred to south america for purchase of more cocaine 
but attorney allan sigel representing nazareth andonian said 
outside court that the government may have been misled by informants 
in the drug trade 
they have a snitch an informant who finds himself in great 
difficulty and in exchange for freedom will say anything said 
sigel 
an affidavit filed in federal court shows that the probe of 
wholesale jewelers began with a tip from an informant in uruguay who 
told an agent about the alleged money laundering operation 
the complaint is inference and innuendo because of the 
government view that they the andonians have large amounts of 
unexplained cash said sigel 
but he added that one who deals in gold bullion deals in huge 
amounts of cash its quite common to deal in millions of dollars in 
the gold business 
thus he said that government surveillance videotapes which 
showed employees counting vast amounts of cash at andonian brothers 
manufacturing co may reflect legal activities 
sigel said he would show at the bail hearing next monday that the 
andonians were men of modest circumstances who made a legitimate 
living by brokering gold at a modest commission 
he said the andonians are worth less than 500000 each that 
each man owns a 250000 home and they make car payments like the 
rest of us 
he said the andonians american citizens who are of lebanese and 
syrian descent have been active in community and church affairs and 
that religious leaders were anxious to vouch for them in court

a california businessman testified 
monday that he saw a navy sergeant take a bribe to release an 
overcrowded tourist boat on new years eve that sank minutes later 
killing 55 people 
peter tripp an electronics equipment dealer from beverly hills 
who was on the fateful cruise told police he was certain he had 
seen one of cruises organizers pay off a navy port authority 
official who stopped the vessel as it headed for a fireworks display 
on rios famous copacabana beach 
the doubledecked bateau mouche iv was carrying an estimated 150 
people three under its legal limit when it flipped over and sank

safely carry more than 62 people 
in a sworn statement given to special investigator wladimir 
sergio reale of the rio de janeiro state civil police department 
tripp said a sgt braga of the port authority was counting 
passengers when a fat bearded man named mr garcia gave him money 
francisco garcia riveiro an owner of the itatiaia turismo travel 
agency that hired the bateau mouche iv for the cruise was briefly 
arrested last month along with the boats owners and then 
released also questioned at that time was port authority sgt 
antonio braga vasconcellos who boarded the boat for an inspection 
but denied taking money 
the accident caused a national outcry and demands for the 
punishment of those responsible the bateau mouche which sold 
tickets at 220 apiece tipped over amid what survivors said was 
overcrowding aggravated by rough water with life preservers hard to 
find or tied down 
the rio de janeiro state government which has vowed to 
aggressively prosecute the case paid for a firstclass roundtrip 
ticket for tripp 40 
riveiros lawyer nilo batista said tripps deposition wasnt 
worth a secondclass ticket on a train

the first week of a crackdown on political 
asylum applications ended monday with approvals granted to only 2 
percent of those applying federal officials said 
of 329 applications submitted here seven have been approved for 
asylum since tuesday when the immigration and naturalization 
service sped up its procedures for handling asylum applications 
under the new procedures all applications are processed in a 
single day but those whose applications are rejected are subject to 
immediate arrest and detention and are marked for deportation 
all seven approved for refugee status are from nicaragua said 
virginia kice spokeswoman for the agencys harlingen district at 
the southern tip of texas 
political asylum is granted to people who are judged to be 
fleeing persecution the ins instituted its new policy because it 
believes most of the emigrants are traveling to the united states 
for economic reasons 
the number of applicants has plunged since the new gettough 
procedure began ins examiners processed 233 last tuesday 51 
wednesday 10 thursday 19 friday and 16 monday 
two weeks ago when applicants still were able to travel on to 
their us destinations to pursue their cases the agency was seeing 
500 a day 
things have slowed down so much that some of the extra personnel 
brought in last week to carry out the new procedures went home 
monday said al de leon assistant district director for 
examinations twentysix examiners left monday he said leaving 24 
here to process cases 
one of two state department personnel on hand since last week to 
issue advisory opinions on the cases left thursday according to the 
ins 
sixteen cases processed monday resulted in 11 denials of asylum 
four approvals and one notice of intent to deny meaning that 
person was given 15 days to supply improved documentation to bolster 
a borderline case 
an exact number of people affected by the decisions was 
unavailable because dependants sometimes file jointly with the 
principal applicant ms kice said 
the number of people detained as a result of the new procedure 
was unavailable but the inmate count at an immigration service 
detention center on monday was double the population of a week ago

the state will soon begin voluntary aids 
testing for convicts leaving the new york prison system corrections 
commissioner thomas coughlin said monday 
any inmate being released from prison can be tested at their 
request under the program administered by the corrections health 
and parole departments he said the program is set to begin april 1 
currently only inmates who exhibit symptoms of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome or who are considered highrisk aids candidates 
may be tested voluntarily 
under the new program any departing inmate who tests positive 
for the aids virus will be referred to counseling and health 
services coughlin said 
the test is kind of a backhanded way of seeing if there is any 
aids transmission in the prisons said the commissioner who 
discussed the new testing program during a joint legislative hearing 
on the 19891990 prisons budget 
coughlin said he doesnt believe aids is spread among inmates 
i think there is sexual activity and i think there is drug 
abuse going on but i dont think that youre going to find 
massive transmission of the aids virus within the prison system 
he said 
the aids epidemic has not exploded within the prison system as 
some people expected coughlin said 
everybody said four five years ago that the prisons would have 
thousands and thousands of aids cases coughlin said but it 
just hasnt happened 
the aids patient rate has remained constant at about three per 
thousand for three years he said there are now about 400 inmates 
with aids symptoms 
coughlin gave the aids education program for all inmates partial 
credit for averting an explosion of aids in the prisons 
however he said hes still preparing for an increase in inmate 
aids cases because of the number of drug abusers we have in the 
system 
aids is caused by a virus that damages the bodys immune system 
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring

mayor eugene sawyer stepped up the pace of his 
campaign monday buoyed by late poll results showing him closing in 
on democratic rival richard m daley one day before a courtordered 
primary election 
were going to get our people to knock on doors all during the 
day today and tonight and tomorrow morning sawyer said during a 
campaign stop at a west side high school one of at least 10 
campaign events during the day 
sawyer the citys second black mayor was joined by jesse 
jackson at the school and at a south side church he also campaigned 
at a public housing project two senior citizens centers and other 
spots 
at the south side church monday night the finale of sawyers 
primary campaign jackson tried to rally blacks by recalling the 
long struggle for the right to vote 
we died too young bled too profusely and lost too many martyrs 
to not vote he said we stand tonight on the tombstone of the 
martyrs who paid not with the dollar but their lives for the right 
to vote 
vote for sawyer with a passion jackson said 
daley was busy too the son of legendary mayor richard j daley 
visited restaurants shook hands with commuters at elevated train 
stations and walked through neighborhoods in a frenetic final day of 
campaigining 
im campaigning very hard daley assured reporters as he made 
one of more than 15 planned campaign stops 
tuesdays primaries in the nations thirdlargest city are a step 
toward filling the vacancy left by former mayor harold washington 
chicagos first black mayor who died in november 1987 the illinois 
supreme court last year ordered the special election to fill the 
last two years of his term 
sawyer who was elected acting mayor by fellow aldermen days 
after washingtons death has been struggling to keep the seat but 
as election day neared he steadily closed on daley the cook county 
states attorney 
poll results released monday showed sawyer 7 percentage points 
behind 
until the last two weeks the campaign had been relatively free 
of the racial rancor that had marked recent mayoral elections since 
then daley has been accused of being a racist and sawyers camp 
made use of a videotape in which daley appears to tell a 
predominantly white audience that you want a white mayor 
daley denied making the statement his supporters say the 
candidate who is well known for garbling his syntax slipped and 
inserted an extraneous word that sounded like what not 
white 
the election marks the fifth time in two years that chicago 
voters have been called to the polls and some residents appear to 
be turned off by the campaign 
what they need to do is stop this black and white stuff and get 
a qualified person said sidney turner 43 an undecided voter 
the chicago election is one of three mayoral elections taking 
place around the nation tuesday 
in st petersburg fla three challengers are trying to unseat 
mayor robert ulrich in a nonpartisan primary and in wichita kan 
where residents approved a change in the structure of city 
government last november 16 candidates are vying in the first 
mayoral election since 1916 
in chicago the board of election commissioners predicted 68 
percent of the citys 1549367 registered voters would go to the 
polls temperatures are expected to be in the 20s with a threat of 
light snow 
although early polls showed daley far ahead of sawyer both 
candidates said the latest results confirm what they maintained 
throughout the campaign tuesdays vote would be close 
this race is virtually tied up sawyer campaign spokesman 
larry horist said 
daley and sawyer are the top contenders in the fourway 
democratic primary tuesday while three candidates are running on 
the gop ballot 
but the wild card in the race is former alderman edward vrdolyak 
who bolted the democratic party after a 1987 thirdparty loss to 
washington he is running as a writein candidate on the republican 
ticket and could give sawyer an edge by siphoning off white votes 
from daley 
because of the difficulty of counting writein votes the outcome 
of the republican race might not be known until thursday when the 
board of elections makes its final count 
the winners of tuesdays election will run in a general election 
april 4 to determine who will finish the final two years of 
washingtons second term 
washingtons former city council floor leader alderman timothy 
evans will be running in that election as a thirdparty candidate 
hoping to stake a claim to washingtons solid black voting bloc 
the latest poll indicates that the electorate remains divided 
along racial lines 
sawyer received the support of 73 percent of the black voters 
surveyed to daleys 8 percent white voters split 79 percent for 
daley 14 percent for sawyer hispanic voters who could hold the 
key to the election outcome favored daley by a 21 margin 
despite the polarization and some eleventhhour racial 
controversy the election has been remarkable for its lack of 
racial animosity many observers have said 
i think that this campaign marks a real positive movement for 
the city said john mcdermott chairman of the committee on decent 
unbiased campaign tactics a watchdog group formed after the 
racially divisive 1983 elections that led to washington taking power 
despite the racial rhetoric in the past week the number of 
incidents of appealing to bigotry or bias or using fear of the 
other group has declined considerably mcdermott said

mayor marion barry jr hoping to reduce the 
number of drugrelated murders in the nations capital on monday 
proposed a mandatory fiveyear jail term for persons who use guns to 
commit crimes 
we are going to launch an allout assault on weapons in 
washington barry said at a news conference at a police warehouse 
where more than 15000 weapons confiscated over the last several 
years are stored we want to get tough on those who carry guns 
barrys proposal which will be submitted to the city council 
tuesday would toughen the citys current midemeanor gun law which 
includes a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a 1000 fine for 
those caught with unregistered weapons 
barry wants the city to pass the legislation on an emergency 
basis which would enable the council to pass the bill as early as 
tuesday 
barrys bill also proposes redefining the citys bail laws so 
that those caught carrying an unregistered weapon selling drugs or 
using a weapon in an assault could be denied pretrial release 
barry wants to create a drugfree zone covering areas 1000 
feet or less from city schools under that bill those caught using 
or selling drugs in those areas would face an additional threeyear 
jail term 
barrys gun proposal comes as the city is struggling to slow the 
pace of drugrelated killings police blame about 60 percent of last 
years record 372 killings on drugs 
thus far in 1989 89 people have been killed in the district 37 
more than at the same time last year 
weapons seizures are also up while 2225 guns were taken by 
police on city streets in 1987 3863 were taken in 1988

a 3 million libel verdict against the 
detroit news has been reinstated by the michigan court of appeals 
which ruled in an opinion released monday that somebody can be 
defamed by implication 
even if no specific sentence in a story is false and libelous 
the court said in its 30 ruling a lawsuit can be successfully 
brought over the full context of the article including the 
headlines photographs and page layout 
you can libel someone by innuendo in the false impression 
that it creates said jeremiah kenney attorney for two men who 
sued the evening news association publisher of the detroit news 
and several reporters 
joseph locricchio and gary francell charged that a series of 11 
articles in 1978 and 1979 falsely portrayed implied and 
insinuated they had organized crime ties and were engaged in other 
criminal conduct in the development and operation of pine knob an 
outdoor entertainment center northwest of pontiac the appeals court 
said 
kenney said in filing the lawsuit that the plaintiffs pointed 
to the totality of the articles which included implications of mob 
ties two unsolved murders and a series of illegal financial 
arrangements 
a wayne county circuit court jury awarded 3 million to francell 
but didnt give anything to locricchio 
judge michael connor subsequently dismissed the case saying the 
men hadnt proven the articles were false connor said that to find 
the inferences of the articles libelous was contrary to both 
michigan law and federal law 
the appeals court however said the two men had a case even 
though their charges werent based on a specific false statement in 
a particular article 
the court said it believed that michigan law has not eliminated 
defamation by implication reinstated the jury award 
kenney said he didnt think the ruling upholding defamation by 
implication represented a new step in libel law in our view it 
has been the law in michigan for many many years he said 
james stewart an attorney for the news said he disagreed with 
the ruling 
we believe the decision is regrettable and wrong he said he 
said the ruling means that a person can sue successfully for libel 
despite stories being factually correct 
he said lawyers would consult with newspaper officials on whether 
to appeal the case to the state supreme court

about five acres of burning tires continued 
to send smoke billowing into the air monday and the operator of the 
unlicensed tire dump contended that arsonists were to blame for the 
blaze 
have they caught the arsonist yet asked richard evans owner 
of casings inc those tires sat there for a long time and they 
dont set fire to themselves so it has to be arson right 
evans blamed opponents of the dump for the crisis it was 
probably the townspeople who say they dont want it here that 
started it 
the tire dump has been operating without a license for the last 
year since landowner dominick valentines permit application was 
turned down valentine allows casing inc to operate the dump on his 
property 
no cause has been established for the fire which began saturday 
and forced the overnight evacuation of 200 families while schools 
were closed monday stores near the fire reopened and there were no 
evacuations 
fire crews used heavy equipment to pull the tires apart in an 
effort to halt the fires spread and about 40 trucks brought in 
loads of dirt and cement dust to smother the flames 
the tires may be as deep as 30 feet to 130 feet according to 
harold tompkins president of fire hose co no 1 in catskill and 
the fire could burn on for days 
tompkins said the federal environmental protection agency had 
declared that the level of toxins in the acrid black smoke was no 
danger to human health 
he said one firefighter suffered heat exhaustion but no other 
injuries were reported health alerts were posted for people with 
respiratory problems officials said

senate democrats remained unmoved monday in 
their opposition to john towers nomination as defense secretary 
despite his unprecedented pledge to abstain from alcohol if 
confirmed president bush returned home declaring that he hasnt 
wavered one iota in his support 
moments before air force one touched down at andrews air force 
base bush told reporters that only time will tell as to whether 
tower will win senate confirmation 
i dont have any predictions nor do i plan to except to say i 
havent wavered one iota and i dont intend to bush said 
asked if towers pledge would help his cause bush shrugged his 
shoulders and said i dont know 
white house chief of staff john sununu met with republican 
senators and vice president dan quayle on monday night to discuss 
the embattled tower nomination 
after the meeting sen john warner rva ranking republican on 
the armed services panel said there was no discussion about a 
withdrawal by tower the strategy is to go all the way to the mat 
and there will be a vote 
senate republican leader bob dole rkan who was also in the 
meeting agreed there wasnt any plug mentioned no pulling of 
any plug 
during the day senators trekked to a special committee hearing 
room to read the latest fbi report on tower while those members the 
bush administration hopes to sway indicated they are either 
undecided or leaning against confirmation 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater speaking to reporters on 
air force one as bush returned to washington said the president 
will meet with 12 senators beginning early tuesday morning 
fitzwater declined to identify them but congressional staff said 
sens george mitchell dmaine lloyd bentsen dtexas charles 
robb dva bennett johnston dla bill bradley dnj and 
dennis deconcini dariz were among those invited to the white 
house 
bush also telephoned deconcini from aboard air force one and 
urged him to reserve judgment until he had a chance to see all the 
evidence according to the senators staff 
were going to work real hard were going to talk to a lot of 
people and ask them to keep an open mind and to read the fbi report 
and to talk to john tower fitzwater said 
of towers pledge not to drink if confirmed fitzwater said i 
think it should help it should take care of the drinking 
situation 
sen bob graham dfla considered by some a swing vote told 
reporters in miami that towers pledge helps but its not just the 
drinking which is a problem to me 
its a pattern of bad judgment bad judgment in the 1970s in 
drinking bad judgment by placing himself in compromising positions 
as the us arms negotiator in geneva in the mid80s bad judgment 
in accepting large sums from the defense industry in the late 
1980s graham said 
the democraticcontrolled senate armed services committee voted 
119 along party lines last thursday to recommend tha the full 
senate reject the nomination with panel chairman sen sam nunn 
dga citing towers drinking habits among other concerns 
tower on sunday sought to allay the fears of his former 
colleagues by issuing an extraordinary pledge not to take a single 
drink if he is confirmed the full senate is expected to take up the 
nomination wednesday 
democrats hold a 5545 majority in the senate meaning bush must 
pick up at least five democrats and hold all republicans to assure 
confirmation under that scenario quayle would break the tie 
those democrats who hinted that they will oppose confirmation 
emerged from the special senate hearing room saying that towers 
promise and a reading of the fbi report did little to change their 
mind 
its like marrying someone who says trust me ill reform 
said sen paul simon dill you cant do that the experience 
with people who have problems with drink is that these pledges get 
broken much too easily 
i have not heard of any vote changes as a result of towers 
pledge said sen james exon dneb an opponent of the nomination 
he said the pledge could be a doubleedged sword it might be 
interpreted that he wants the job too bad 
sen thomas a daschle dsd said the pledge will have a 
marginal effect and sen john breaux dla said he would vote 
against tower if the vote were today 
if any senator has a serious doubt about the competence of a 
candidate that he should err on the side of safety said breaux 
in that case it indicates voting negatively 
the president flew home from his fiveday asia trip monday and 
planned to meet with undecided democrats in hopes of capturing 
enough votes for tower 
the administration is also faced with some wavering republicans 
over the weekend sen nancy kassebaum of kansas said she was 
undecided and sen larry pressler of south dakota said he would vote 
against confirmation 
robb also undecided said he was keeping an open mind but 
he called towers action an astute move on his part he addressed 
at least one of the outstanding questions 
sen howell heflin of alabama one of several southern democrats 
still considered open to the white house lobbying effort said he 
has to review all the evidence was trying to be openminded 
judicial and fair 
sen david pryor dark said he admired tower for his pledge 
and declined to disclose his decision but he said he doesnt intend 
to read the fbi report earlier this month pryor said tower has 
become his own worst enemy and predicted that he would not be 
confirmed 
sen christopher dodd dconn told a news conference in 
hartford that he remains undecided and will make a decision after 
reading the fbi report 
republicans repeated their support for tower with sen jesse 
helms rnc saying he didnt find anything more in the report 
than ive found so far and sen christopher bond rmo claiming 
that the pledge puts to rest any doubts about his capabilities or 
any impairment 
the white house is preparing a version of the confidential fbi 
report for public release in hopes of demonstrating that allegations 
against tower are baseless

the large drug seizures announced with fanfare 
by law enforcement authorities are having little effect on supplies 
on the street with dealers simply absorbing them as a cost of doing 
business federal officials say 
historically a manager of drug couriers gives up one courier 
who is body carrying drugs to take your attention away from four 
more said bill norsworthy a drug enforcement administration 
agent at the el paso intelligence center 
people walk away from a brand new aircraft after one load and 
consider that an expense of the trip he said the same goes for 
boats automobiles campers they expect to pay a price 
a better way to assess how the united states is doing in the war 
on drugs is to ignore the ballyhoo about drug busts and concentrate 
on the price and purity level of drugs on the street says sen

congressional democrats are split over their 
budget strategy two weeks after president bush put them on the spot 
with a 116 trillion spending proposal that leaves many of the 
difficult questions unanswered 
some leading democrats lean toward cooperation with the 
administration perhaps culminating in fullfledged highlevel 
negotiations as the best way to forge a spending plan and to cut 
the deficit to 100 billion as required under the grammrudman 
balanced budget law 
house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif and 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine are among those 
advocating a cooperative approach 
my sense is that as long as the administration wants to discuss 
issues and look at options together were prepared to do that

neonazis are preparing 
commemorations on the 100th anniversary of adolf hitlers birth next 
month and west german officials are bracing for possible outbreaks 
of rightist violence 
the nazi dictator was born april 20 1889 in the austrian 
village of braunau just over the border from bavaria 
this is the most important event weve had in a long time 
said michael kuehnen west german neonazi leader 
the preparations come as west germans warily eye a rise in 
extremerightist sentiments in their country in january for 
example the republican party made a strong showing in west berlins 
elections by calling for the expulsion of foreigners and 
asylumseekers 
neonazis from several countries are expected at the european 
hitler convention specifically designed to commemorate the 
dictators 100th birthday but kuehnen declined to specify exactly 
when or where it will take place 
we dont want to give the country time to gear up to prevent 
it he said but added that spain or scandinavia were possible 
places federal law bars such a meeting in west germany although 
kuehnen promises smaller birthday commemorations in the frankfurt 
area 
the neonazi leader who often wears a brown shirt and black 
pants said the number of participants at the hitler convention 
could range from 1000 to several thousand depending on the 
location 
kuehnen whose organizing committee even has a logo with the 
initials ah in the center insisted there will be no organized 
violence on the hitler anniversary 
but we arent responsible for every young person and every 
soccer rowdy the 33yearold neonazi added in a telephone 
interview fringe groups espousing neonazi and rightist beliefs 
occasionally disturb professional soccer games in west germany 
kuehnen who has spent more than seven years in prison for 
neonazi activities has set up an office in frankfurt to organize 
the birthday event with the help of his followers hes hoping 
neonazis and rightwing extremists from spain france denmark 
belgium and norway as well as west germany will attend the european 
convention 
although the birthday falls in april there were reports as early 
as january about plans for an observance in the west german news 
media 
the newsmagazine der spiegel said on jan 30 that this years 
celebrations are meant to attract public attention and distribute 
propaganda in contrast to previous years 
in the past rightwing extremist cronies drank to the fuehrer 
in the back rooms of german bars and in hotels of hitlers austrian 
birthplace of braunau der spiegel noted 
braunau itself was the site of a clash between neonazis and 
procommunists on hitlers 90th birthday in 1979 
this past jan 22 the conservative welt am sonntag newspaper 
said officials already were bracing for acts of violence and that 
jews and foreigners were possible targets 
matthias strohs a spokesman on internal security issues for the 
badenwuerttemberg state interior ministry agrees that trouble 
could break out 
theres no question you can count on acts of violence he 
said the possible targets range from foreigners to german 
officials and allied military installations 
allies france britain and the united states drew the neonazis 
wrath for keeping rudolf hess hitlers deputy in prison until he 
died in what was officially determined as a suicide in 1987 
although the soviets were primarily responsible for rejecting pleas 
for clemency 
strohs speaking by telephone from his office in stuttgart said 
vandalism and pronazi slogans painted on walls were also a 
possibility around the time of the birthday 
the spokesman said officials assume oldergeneration nazis will 
also commemorate hitlers birthday but in a much less public way 
the older ones are much more careful in the way they act 
strohs said they wont make such a spectacle out in the public 
it will be more of an internal affair 
alfons metzger spokesman for the bavarian interior ministry also 
said violence cant be ruled out as a possibility on the hitler 
birthday and that police are alerted to it 
several smaller neonazi groups also routinely celebrate hitlers 
birthday and are expected to do so again this year federal 
officials say there are about 28300 rightwing extremists in this 
country of 613 million people 
the deutsche volksunion german peoples union identified by 
federal authorities as west germanys largest rightwing extremist 
organization has totally disassociated itself from the hitler 
commemorations 
we are convinced that on april 20 1989 there will be several 
birthday celebrations for hitler said bernd droese spokesman for 
the party which claims a membership of 25000 fifty percent of 
them will take place in loony bins where some people assert they 
are the reincarnation of the fuehrer 
the other 50 percent will be organized by agents and 
provocateurs who want to let the specter of the fuehrer ghost wander 
around

victor paz estenssoro is in the final 
months of a presidency that brought a stability rarely seen before 
in bolivia south americas poorest nation 
in a country that has had 75 governments in 163 years of 
independence just completing a presidential term is accomplishment 
and few other than paz estenssoro have been able to do it 
of the 75 governments only 38 were constitutionally elected the 
rest came about by military coup or some other unconstitutional 
manipulation or revolution 
paz estenssoro himself led two revolutions a leftist one in the 
1950s and a conservative one three decades later 
when he took office after the conservative one bolivia was in 
the grips of a dizzying 24000percent inflation it took 165000 
bolivian pesos to buy one dollars worth of goods and interest rates 
were soaring around 800 percent 
paz estenssoro brought the economy back to its feet but to do so 
he had to undo what he had done in his first revolution 
his third presidential term ends aug 6 the 164th anniversary of 
independence from spain at 81 he plans to retire and turn the 
future of bolivias 67 million people over to the candidate who is 
elected in presidential balloting may 17 
paz estenssoro wishes to be remembered as the man who was able 
to carry out two revolutions said his minister of information 
herman antelo 
paz estenssoro first assumed the presidency in 1952 returning 
from exile at the end of a unionbacked popular revolution that 
toppled a military government and shattered the oligarchic control 
of a small group of tin mining barons 
his government was considered one of the most radical of its time 
in south america it nationalized the tin mines gave peasants the 
right to vote and provided them with land by breaking up large 
estates 
he lost in the 1956 elections but returned to office by winning 
the vote four years later he completed that term and was 
reelected but toppled in a military coup in late 1964 
twenty one years later in 1985 he again became president this 
time on a conservative platform he said times had changed and a 
new approach was needed to solve bolivias problems 
he dismantled the state mining monopoly he had created 
modernized the economy and successfully challenged the authority of 
leftist labor unions that flourished during the 1952 revolution 
the courage and commitment demonstrated by bolivia under the 
presidency of victor paz estenssoro are exemplary and certainly 
underappreciated abroad us ambassador robert gelbard said in 
an interview 
no other democratic government in latin america has 
demonstrated the resolve to undertake a program of fundamental 
structural change and then to stick by it 
when he began this latest term the staggering economy had led to 
widespread social unrest and virtually all foreign economic 
assistance had been cut off 
his government prescribed harsh remedies the currency was 
devalued by 94 percent all price supports were lifted wages frozen 
and 17 of the 21 governmentrun mines were shut down as highly 
unprofitable of the nations 26500 miners 21000 lost their jobs 
while the bolivian workers central maintains that most of the 
fired miners remain unemployed information minister antelo said 
some 18000 have found other work 
in all 35000 government employees were dismissed 
the workers central responded to the austerity measures with a 
general strike but paz estenssoro broke it by declaring a state of 
seige and sending labor leaders to internment camps 
by 1988 inflation had plunged to 21 percent labor unrest has 
eased in part because of an emergency public works program launched 
with 100 million in aid from the world bank and european 
governments the country now enjoys a renewed steady flow of 
foreign aid 
to stop corruption outside agencies were hired to handle 
government purchases and contracts french and english companies 
have been put in charge of imports certifying their quality and 
collecting duties 
the tax system was overhauled and computerized and tax revenues 
have tripled in three years 
ambassador gelbard said paz estenssoros program could serve as 
a model for other countries struggling with the burdens of a statist 
tradition despite the formidable problems that the country still 
confronts the chances of bolivia generating consistent economic 
growth and consolidating its hold on democracy are very good 
the reforms have carried a steep social cost however 
malnutrition and illiteracy still plague most of bolivias 
largely indian population 
the minimum monthly wage is the equivalent of 40 while the 
prices of most food products are comparable to those in the united 
states 
unemployment hovers above 20 percent but is declining 
the governments economic policies have led to starvation wages 
for the working class charged simon reyes secretary general of 
the workers central 
he claimed the government had capitulated to the demands of the 
international banking community while factories are closing and 
workers earning power is shrinking

edmond naim governor of lebanons central 
bank is in the unique position of holding the purse strings of 
lebanons rival christian and moslem governments 
but hes a virtual prisoner in the bank building where he has 
lived for 19 months 
naim is a maronite catholic and the bank is in moslem west 
beirut for him to leave could be dangerous 
the bank nonetheless is the only government institution that 
remains intact in lebanons 5monthold political crisis which has 
split the government the army and every other department down the 
middle 
this has given the 70yearold naim unprecedented powers 
he said he bankrolls the basic needs of both governments 
including food and fuel imports to prevent a complete collapse of 
lebanons fractured public services 
in june 1987 when prime minister rashid karami was assassinated 
naim moved into the bank headquarters and has never left 
its more practical to live in the bank he said in an 
interview in his plush sixthfloor office the streets arent 
safe 
so now he lives in a tworoom apartment atop the sevenstory 
building which is guarded by 50 policemen 
i cook wash my dishes do my laundry and tend my plants 
there naim said 
his wife travels from the family home in christian east beirut 
every two weeks for a weekend with me at the bank naim said 
mrs naim the former hedda hofer of detroit is a naturalized 
american of german descent 
the political crisis that began in september when president amin 
gemayels sixyear term expired with no successor elected because of 
sectarian bickering left naim the man in the middle 
gemayel named his maronite army commander gen michel aoun to 
head a caretaker military cabinet until a new president was elected 
moslem and leftist factions refused to recognize aoun and backed 
acting premier salim hoss a sunni moslem 
the central bank finances the whole of lebanon according to a 
formula of equality and in line with the population and area each of 
the governments rules naim said 
naims the only official in this country behaving like a father 
to all the lebanese said adnan badra a sunni businessman in west 
beirut 
although lebanons economy is in peril after nearly 14 years of 
civil war the central bank has gold reserves estimated at about 5 
billion with 800 million in foreign currency 
naim a lawyer and former university dean brought out of 
retirement in 1983 to run the bank has shown that he will not be 
bullied by political pressure from either side 
aoun has sought to impose his christian governments authority on 
the bank in december he closed the only crossing between east and 
west beirut for 10 days after naim allocated funds to moslem army 
units 
naim responded by providing the equivalent of 1 million dollars 
to the moslem side to import flour because aouns blockade choked 
off supplies from the main warehouses in east beirut 
naim has also had to contend with a serious banking crisis 
the almashrek bank went under in december because of a run by 
depositors panicked by reports it was overstretched through hefty 
investments 
the central bank however underwrote claims by its 
noninstitutional depositors 
by law we were not obliged to do what we did naim 
explained its not our duty to aid banks in trouble but we 
intervened not just to help almashrek but to protect the banking 
sector and lebanese society 
by feb 15 the central bank had covered claims for 7 billion 
lebanese pounds 14 million and the equivalent to 17 million in 
foreign currencies naim said 
but for naim id have lost my life savings when almashrek 
went under said badra the sunni businessman 
i had all my money in almashrek said ahmad rabbou a moslem 
vegetable merchant when i heard it had collapsed i felt that 30 
years of hard work was lost 
when naim announced that the central bank would guarantee 
almashreks deposits it was like giving life to a dead man

richard m nixon volunteer adviser to just 
about every president he has known has some foreign policy counsel 
for president bush deal warily with mikhail gorbachev or risk 
being taken to the cleaners 
his toughness and intelligence will more than compensate for 
his countrys economic weakness nixon says of the soviet leader 
and his consummate ability in diplomacy and political maneuver 
will guarantee that he seldom winds up with the short end of a 
deal 
the former president who made his imprint in foreign policy 
before he was driven from office by the watergate scandal in 1974 
has been offering counsel on his speciality ever since 
his 1989 installment is in an essay written for the weighty 
magazine foreign affairs 
in it he seconds bushs slow and cautious approach to moscow 
president bush should continue to reject the advice of those 
who urge that he schedule a quick summit with gorbachev in order to 
have a foreign policy victory early in his term nixon writes 
gorbachev needs a summit far more than the president 
only when the bush administration has agreed on a strategy with 
our allies and has a definite program for making significant 
progress on major issues should president bush schedule an 
americansoviet summit 
nixon says that having met twice with nikita khrushchev three 
times with leonid brezhnev and with gorbachev in 1986 he considers 
the current soviet leader in a class of his own 
he is their match in tenacity and forcefulness but outstrips 
them in realism quickness and intelligence nixon writes that 
if western leaders want to avoid being taken to the cleaners they 
must understand what gorbachev wants and how the west should 
respond 
nixon says the new administration should link strategic arms 
control negotiations with economic relations soviet involvement in 
places like nicaragua and angola conventional arms reductions and 
other issues that divide the super powers and take a package 
approach in dealing with moscow 
without linkage gorbachev will string together a series of 
easy victories at the bargaining table he says 
nixon says that europe and the western alliance should be the top 
foreign policy priority for the new administration it should call 
for a major working summit no black ties and no spouses to 
hammer out a strategy for enhancing our collective security he 
writes 
europe was nixons first overseas stop as president 20 years ago 
although black ties and spouses were included on that journey to 
five allied capitals 
then as now there were strains on the nato alliance in nixons 
time it was the decision of charles de gaulle to pull france out of 
the military side of the alliance the current problem is in west 
germany and the issue is modernization of shortrange nuclear 
weapons based there 
nixon writes that one of gorbachevs goals will be to separate 
the united states from europe particularly germany 
secretary of state james a baker iii handled the new 
administrations first mission to europe covering 16 nations in 
eight days he returned saying that the nuclear modernization 
question can be worked out and resolved over the next three months 
nixon also sees a new relationship with china as a major item on 
the gorbachev agenda he said the united states should welcome 
closer relations between the two communist giants we can be 
confident that since chinas top priority remains economic 
development our relations with beijing will continue to be closer 
than the kremlins he says 
president bush knows that territory he served as us envoy to 
china for the nixon administration he went back as president last 
weekend gorbachev plans a visit to china in may bush told chinese 
leader deng xiaoping that the summit with gorbachev would be useful 
in bringing stability to the area and the world and would not 
affect us relations with china 
nixon calls europe the central focus of eastwest conflict now 
he says the west needs a new strategy to strengthen nato and at 
the same time foster peaceful change in eastern europe 
harold macmillan once told me that alliances were held together 
by fear not love nixon writes for many in europe and the 
united states the fear of the soviet union has waned and what love 
may exist between economic competitors in the west is a very weak 
glue to hold an alliance together

the cost of health care is the greased pig of 
inflation fighting forever slipping from the grasp of those who 
seek to wrestle it under control 
no matter what strategy is used the beast eludes it penned in 
it leaps the fence seemingly winded it charges tormentors 
scattering them and their ideas and strategies 
it has left some of the best minds in health care government 
labor think tanks and corporations feeling incompetent and 
frustrated new approaches are developed each year almost 
invariably they too end up spattered in mud 
for decades it has been that way 
from 1967 to 1984 the medical care segment of the consumer price 
index quadrupled despite attempts at control the health and human 
services budget in 1970 was 477 billion this year it will be 
eight times that 
in all us spending on health care reached 5003 billion last 
year according to the conference board a new yorkbased business 
research group that was up 10 percent from the year before or more 
than double the general rate of consumer price inflation 
the increase continues this year the sharp sixtenths of one 
percent rise in the january consumer price index included a major 
contribution from medical care that segment led the advances 
rising eighttenths of a percent 
the increase is showing up in business costs too much of the 
recent jump in private employment costs has been caused by the 
rising level of expenditures for employee benefits which 
increasingly are health related 
the big health care bills result not only because of specific 
cost increases such as in doctors fees but also because the 
number and variety of health care products is expanding it is a 
growth industry a blue chip 
even success does not help matters some diseases become more 
prominent or vitally important as more people live to ripe old ages 
new technology helps overcome problems but almost always raises 
costs 
there are surprise factors in the problem aids for example was 
hardly anticipated and few medical people foresaw the incredible 
spread of substance abuse the cost of which might account for 3 
percent of corporate payrolls 
that estimate was made by a consulting firm mercer meidinger 
hansen after surveying corporate chiefs governors and mayors and 
81 percent felt the problem will worsen if more public resources 
arent devoted to solutions 
the rampaging cost of health care has been the subject of so many 
studies that very little about causes is left unknown 
inefficiency of delivery probably is the most commonly mentioned 
factor with critics zeroing in on practices that are considered 
wasteful in a business sense many of these deficiencies however 
already have been corrected 
thirdparty payments have been cited as a cost factor the 
assumption being that 1 individuals are more likely to use medical 
services if they are paid for by insurance and 2 hospitals and 
others dispensers of medical services might be less inclined to curb 
charges when insurers are footing the bill 
for a time insurers also were blamed the accusation against 
them being that they readily acquiesced to higher prices seldom 
challenging hospitals or doctors that has changed however in the 
past decade or more 
a raised level of health consciousness once viewed as a partial 
solution is sometimes cited as a contributant the rationale being 
that to retain good health those most concerned are likely to avail 
themselves of medical services 
but the most basic of all reasons is one unique to health care 
it is the matter of human mortality and the publics inability to 
put a price on life to answer the question of who should live and 
who should be allowed to die 
modern technology can extend indefinitely the lives of many 
terminally ill people but at an enormous price that price puts a 
lid on goods and services in all other markets on what people will 
pay for a car for example 
but how do you apply it to life

carnaby street which soared to fame as the fashion 
pacesetter for beatles generation of the swinging sixties is 
seeking a new incarnation as a mecca for stylish yuppies of the 
1980s 
when mary quants miniskirts and john stephens bellbottom 
hiphuggers clothed the flower children london became the fashion 
capital of the world and carnaby street the favorite haunt of the 
mods and rockers 
for about a decade young people from new york to sydney flocked 
to boutiques called tom cat take 6 and lord john to buy the latest 
in hot pants platform shoes wide floral ties and psychedelic 
shirts 
but as styles changed and rents soared in the early 1970s 
stephen and other designers moved out and carnaby street took on a 
tacky downmarket flavor 
the street remains a microcosm of english fashion over the last 
20 years shoppers can buy the 60s mod look 70s hippie and ethnic 
fashions and 80s punk leather and sadomasochistic gear including 
studded leather belts sex pistols tshirts and neofascist and 
nazisymbol buttons 
now the peachey property corp the private real estate company 
that owns about threequarters of carnaby street wants to restore 
some fashion magnetism to the twoblock thoroughfare tucked behind 
regent street in the heart of central london 
were not trying to revive the 60s said peter bourne 
peacheys surveyor for carnaby street what we are aiming to do in 
carnaby street is cater to the betteroff young market the 1530 
age group who like the young kids in the 60s had no shops 
catering to them especially in central london 
over the last two years peachey has replaced about half of the 
shops that sold this fashion mishmash with branches of pricier 
fashion chains like benetton supreme capricorn confetti and midas 
the naziinsignia merchants have proved such an embarrassment 
that the two main stores on an alley off carnaby street are being 
forced out of business under pressure from peachey westminster 
borough authorities and antifascist campaigners 
mary quant who worked out of the kings road in chelsea in the 
1960s has opened her first shop on carnaby street selling makeup 
and accessories she said she was lured by the revival of the 
surrounding soho area as a center for young people and young 
industries 
bourne hopes the whole street eventually will be yuppified with 
wine bars restaurants and art galleries 
it does take a long time to move a whole area around he said 
in an interview not only do we have to change tenents but we 
have to tell the world this area has changed 
last june peachey relaunched carnaby street with balloons 
20000 leaflets and the message that it was now synonymous with 
chic and stylish london this year it hopes to start regular 
street theater and entertainment and stage fashion and art shows 
knitwear designer marion foale who moved into carnaby street in 
the early 1960s and did clothes for the beatles remembers when it 
was a quaint backwater where you could get a saddle mended 
now its beginning to come up again she said but its 
always different the next carnaby street will have its own 
incarnation 
but many shoppers designers and storekeepers mourn the carnaby 
street they say is gone forever 
its an interesting historic relic its where it all 
started said los angelesborn giffi fields who started selling 
handpainted madetomeasure mens clothes to carnaby street shops 
in the late 1960s 
carnaby street was a oneoff oneofakind area at its time 
because it was a street devoted to youth culture he said every 
major city in the world today doesnt have only one street but many 
streets devoted to youth culture so you just dont get the 
uniqueness anymore and you wont get the uniqueness 
at inderwicks pipe shop a carnaby street landmark for at least 
70 years and the only store left from the 1960s owner peter 
anderson doubted peachey would succeed because the street is getting 
the same stores as dozens of other shopping areas in london 
most shops are multiple or franchises not one shop has 
individual character except the great frog because they make their 
own jewelry said the 64yearold businessman 
i cant see it ever becoming what theyre aiming for its 
still a street without any character 
shopkeepers at both ends of the market are unhappy with carnaby 
streets current clientele 
those at the top said the street was still attracting the same 
customers it did in 1975 young people looking for cheap clothes 
but those at the bottom complained that the punks mods skinheads 
and hippies had gone and the street was attracting too many straight 
people in suits 
potential shoppers wandering along the street recently were also 
unimpressed 
its just like a pedestrian walkway with tacky shops on either 
side complained allen sawkins 30 a student and motorcycle 
courier its just a tourist trap most people from london 
wouldnt come here 
alan tate 20 a student from manchester said its gone 
downhill its too respectable now the businessmen have taken over 
it tries to be anarchic and antiestablishment but it does it all 
commercially so its not unique

a slumping economy is sending norwegians on 
bargain hunts in junk shops and secondhand stores 
when north sea oil wealth flowed norwegians spent freely in an 
economy that quickly became overheated but the boom came to an 
abrupt end two years ago when oil prices plunged 
business is booming said leon andersen who runs a salvation 
army shop in the city of stavanger its better than ever so far 
this year sales are up 30 percent compared to last year 
people come here looking for everything from used clothes to 
furniture theyre being more careful with their money 
we just may run out of used merchandise people seem to be 
holding onto their things they make do with an old couch for 
another year or use an old dress another season 
stavanger the nations oil capital on the west coast was 
hardest hit by the collapse of oil prices in 1986 but the drop in 
national income has squeezed the whole country 
with its offshore oil fields pumping 144 million barrels a day 
lower crude prices quickly chilled norways overheated economy 
tough measures including legislated wage controls have helped 
reduce inflation and the trade deficit but unemployment doubled in 
the last year to 4 percent the highest since the 1930s and 
thousands of businesses went broke 
the government decisions combined with a modest recovery of oil 
prices hold out promise for the future but it may take time before 
it is felt in the household budget 
many norwegians may be willing to lower their standards a 
little compared to 1986 said oddbjoern eiden an economist for 
the confederation of norwegian business and industry 
he said consumer spending declined 16 percent in 1988 after 
dropping 27 percent in 1987 in 1986 the peak of the oil boom and 
spending spiral consumption leaped 57 percent 
its hard to say why people would buy more used merchandise 
said oddbjoern knutsen of the state institude of social research he 
said it was possible that norwegians were simply returning to a 
normal state of affairs 
i dont think the spending spree of mid1980s was typical oil 
resulted in an economic growth that was without equal in the west 
and people spent money freely he said 
its more typical of norwegians to be careful with money if 
they are indeed buying more used things and not discarding as much 
then it seems we are returning to the cautious ways of the 1950s and 
1960s when norway was not a rich nation 
arne johansen who works for oslos fivestore elevator thrift 
shops said he noticed an upswing in sales just after the economic 
slump began 
we havent noticed much of an increase since 1987 at any of our 
stores individually sales are pretty stable but a lot more used 
merchandise shops have opened in oslo during the past year or two 
he said 
business is up said willy olsen who has owned oslos 
willys used merchandise for 22 years but a lot of new stores 
have opened there must be 10 that opened in the past two years 
twentynine thrift shops are listed in the telephone book for 
oslo a city of 425000

alphabetically speaking yuba city calif was 
used to being last on lists but catching the caboose in rand 
mcnallys places rated almanac four years ago insulted residents 
right down to their toes 
at first they fumed they raged they stamped their collective 
civic feet then they got smart 
city leaders decided there are only two places to be on the 
list the top and the bottom said mary knapp yubasutter 
chamber of commerce executive vice president it depends what you 
make of both of them 
what yuba citians made from last place was a heap of firstrate 
public relations hay 
in the 50 years since one el thorndike created his goodness 
index for american cities academicians special interest groups 
magazines and the federal government have cranked out a plethora of 
rankings identifying the best of all possible towns 
stressed out live in state college pa says one survey cedar 
rapids iowa says another 
best place for a hip contemporary career woman seattle savvy 
magazine says 
easiest place to make friends san francisco forbes magazine 
says 
no 1 overall its pittsburgh says one survey danbury conn 
says another 
in a nation where everybody loves the underdog but nobody wants 
to be one where everyone says it doesnt matter what other people 
think but no one believes it city ratings have become a source of 
indignation elation frustration and always fascination 
now its almost time for another edition of places rated 
the most objective and carefully researched of the bunch like the 
presidential election it appears every four years and a lot of 
people dont like the results 
the fallout has included threatened lawsuits map and magazine 
burnings and on a number of occasions campaigns for civic 
improvements 
but ask researchers city officials and municipal groups what 
city rankings mean and how seriously to take them and the answers 
seem to be not much and not very 
theres no best city just like theres no best work of art 
said bert sperling a portland ore computer researcher who 
despite that opinion created software that rates cities whos to 
say van goghs sunflower is better than da vincis the last 
supper 
and whos to say there are 328 better places to live than yuba 
city why places rated authors david savageau and richard 
boyer thats who 
when yuba city leaders reflected on how to make the best out of 
being the worst they decided to lighten up 
if you screamed and ranted and raved you made a fool of 
yourself knapp said we decided to make a fun thing of it 
first 1000 residents burned hundreds of rand mcnally maps at a 
community pep rally packaged the ashes in a walnut box and had a 
local mortician present them to a rand mcnally vice president who 
flew out from chicago just for the occasion 
then the city helped a radio station in pittsburgh rated no 1 
in the same survey award an allexpense paid trip to yuba city as 
a contest prize the happy winners toured the city by limousine and 
rode a float in the 105th annual bokkai festival a good time was 
had by all 
and at years end when life magazine wrapped up 1985 it was 
yuba city not pittsburgh that received a full page and they 
spelled the name right knapp mused a little amazed 
it took places rated to not only rocket yuba city out of 
obscurity but to propel the metro ratings game onto the bestseller 
list 
the idea sprang from the authors desire to move out of boston 
and their discovery that there was no single source for good solid 
data on life in us cities they decided to compile a comprehensive 
american cities reference guide and sold rand mcnally on the idea 
in 1978 
the first edition with atlanta at the top and lawrence mass 
in the cellar came out in 1981 
more than 300000 book sales later savageau says hes a bit 
disappointed that the book is considered more the topic of cocktail 
party chitchat than the serious reference tool the authors intended 
and he acknowledges its popularity still baffles him 
i wouldnt go out and buy a book that said pittsburgh was the 
best place in the country he said taking a rare break from his 
computer and the latest edition of places rated due out this 
fall from simon amp schuster inc which acquired the series last year 
from rand mcnally 
when the statistics laid the exalted mantel of extreme livability 
on pittsburgh a city once known as hell with the lid off even 
rand mcnally didnt believe it at first 
the crowning of pittsburgh illustrates the key difference between 
places rated and other city rankings 
the savageauboyer study gives equal weight to climate housing 
crime transportation health care recreation education the arts 
and economics that might tend to give an edge to larger cities 
which have more amenities and doesnt take into account which 
factors people think are most important 
other studies tend to focus on one aspect of life such relief 
from stress which the advocacy group zero population growth found 
in cedar rapids and a study in psychology today magazine found in 
state college 
or they consider the preferences of a specific group of people 
as money magazine does polling 251 subscribers in its 1987 survey 
pittsburgh was 43rd nashua nh was no 1 last year pittsburgh 
moved to no 20 danbury conn was top of the heap 
a change from one year to the next in what the subscribers 
consider most important say education over leisure or 
transportation over weather plus even a small shift in a citys 
vital statistics can account for a wild fluctuation said sperling 
whose company fast forward has created a computer program called 
places usa used by money 
some of the cities that have been disappointingly rated have 
used it to say oh yeah and show they have a strong community 
support base said randy arndt spokesman for the national league 
of cities it depends on the resourcefulness of the city 
the league wouldnt dream of ranking its 1400 members i dont 
know who these surveys benefit except the authors everybody 
doesnt live in the perfect place but its home to us arndt 
said whether you live in scarsdale or saginaw life is what you 
make of it 
the same can be said of city ratings 
in the next places rated savageau and boyer plan a section 
designed to make everyone happy by showing how under certain 
conditions using factors in the book any burg can be a pittsburgh 
for instance if the only thing youre interested in are cities 
in california with a moderate climate and low cost of living 
savageau said yuba city would be the best place in the whole 
country

editors note most jews leaving the soviet union today are 
heading somewhere other than israel thats partly because the dream 
has gone sour for many of the socalled refuseniks who reached 
the promised land after years of persecution only to find that in 
israel the issues are not always black and white further soviet 
jews dont always feel welcome in the jewish state 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
after years of struggle to get out of the soviet 
union often at the pain of prison or siberian exile many former 
refuseniks have become disillusioned at what they found when 
they reached their promised land 
israel they have discovered is beset by a chaotic political 
system and deep social divisions between religious and secular jews 
even more disturbing to some is the harsh repression of the 
palestinian uprising that has been going on for more than a year 
now more than 385 palestinians have died 
natan sharansky whose 12year emigration battle made him a hero 
of soviet jewry has found his loyalties torn between his jewish 
patriotism and his concern for human rights 
two of his former colleagues in the fight inside the soviet union 
ida nudel and yosef begun have been stunned more by the cool 
reception that many soviet immigrants receive in israel 
the situation of the immigrants here is so bad after devoting 
20 years of my life to this issue it is very painful for me to face 
what is happening said nudel known as the guardian angel for 
risking her own life to help other jews in prison 
these and other activists say that stories about such 
difficulties filtering back home are a major reason why most jews 
leaving the soviet union today under the glasnost policies of 
mikhail gorbachev are chosing to live someplace besides israel 
in 1988 jewish emigration from the soviet union hit an 
eightyear high of 20082 but only 7 percent came to israel a 
record dropout rate since the emigration struggle began two 
decades ago in those years about 255000 soviet jews have settled 
in israel 
nudel whose cause was championed by us secretary of state 
george shultz and stars like jane fonda typifies the loneliness and 
isolation experienced by many immigrants 
she arrived in october 1987 after being a refusenik the 
term for those refused an exit visa for 16 years she still 
suffers backaches from eight years in exile in siberia and in 
bendery south of moscow as punishment for her antisoviet activism 
nudel 57 is a graying and bespectacled woman who stands 
4foot10 she is single in a familyoriented society she recently 
gave away her pet dog pizer brought all the way from siberia 
after it proved too much for her tiny threeroom apartment her 
poor understanding of hebrew makes even watching television a chore 
she spends most of her time at the apartment of her sister elana 
fridman occasionally venturing out to try to help fellow immigrants 
through the maze of israeli bureaucracy to find jobs and housing 
she says she was torn between conflicting impulses the need to 
rebuild her own life and the desire to once again lead a fight for 
jews from her native land 
to be a symbol for a lifetime is too much for any human 
being nudel says physically i also dont feel very strong 
but i feel i cannot rest 
mrs fridman who spearheaded the campaign for her sisters 
release is frustrated that nudel is no longer treated as a heroine 
everyone understands that people like her made history that 
these are people who suffered as jews but i think that there is not 
enough admiration shown mrs fridman says this hurts 
during an interview in her sisters apartment nudel sits 
uneasily on the sofa occasionally massaging the side of her weak 
back she turns the conversation away from herself to focus on the 
plight of immigrants in general 
i think there is a crisis in the ideology israel was built 
upon she says today every newcomer is considered a nuisance 
we should be considering them a blessing 
the wellknown refuseniks who receive government stipends or can 
make a living writing about their experiences do not share the 
poverty of most soviet immigrants 
for them the main problem is dealing with the gap between what 
was a dream and what is the harsh reality of israel says yuri 
stern a spokesman for the soviet jewry education and information 
center 
it takes such tremendous effort and concentration to overcome 
the fears in the soviet union that to survive you need to picture 
israel in an idyllic way stern says then you come here you 
see that it is a real country reality not a dream 
what the refuseniks and other soviet immigrants find is that 
israelis most of whom are middle eastern and not european have 
little concern for the plight of the new immigrants 
many nativeborn israelis recall their parents hard times in a 
new country 40 years ago and speak resentfully of the small 
government aid given to newcomers 
israelis say they dont understand why the russians shout they 
say when we came here back in the 1950s we lived in tents but 
this is a different time nobody lives in tents anymore says 
yosef begun 56 the former refusenik who waged a 17year battle to 
emigrate 
begun spent about a decade in and out of jail discarding his 
profession as a mathematician to help revive the study of hebrew 
language and culture in moscow he arrived in israel about a year 
ago 
unlike nudel begun has found his niche in jerusalems religious 
community and basks in his newfound freedom 
after the snows of moscow where people wore gloomy faces 
because there was never enough food here we are in a blossoming 
colorful country the bearded begun says seated by a window 
overlooking jerusalems old walled city

he works for the jewish agency in a program to revive soviet 
jewish culture moscows new liberalized policies toward minorities 
are allowing him to do from jerusalem what he couldnt do 10 years 
ago in moscow 
but begun believes that israel is not doing enough to revive 
judaism in the soviet union and is critical that the issue has 
little public sympathy in israel 
i fear that what gorbachev is doing now will only amount to 
window dressing if we dont take action to help more jews learn 
about their past he says most soviet jews only know they are 
jewish because it is written in their passports 
the 41yearold sharansky has found his new life in israel to be 
a study in contrasts between personal bliss and disillusionment with 
israeli society 
sharansky a former member of andrei sakharovs human rights 
watch committee heads a new lobby group that tries to help soviet 
immigrants settle in israel he is the father of two daughters 
2yearold rachel and hannah born last november 
he immigrated in february 1986 after a dramatic spy swap on 
berlins glienicke bridge he had spent nine years in prison on 
charges of antisoviet espionage his sentence was reduced from 13 
years after a tireless campaign by his wife avital who traveleds back 
in his 
office swivel chair and says 
its a strange feeling a happy end without an end in the 
movies theres a twominute ending and its over this one just goes 
on and on 
i still cannot even get used to saying the phrases the 
children are sleeping the children are playing the very word 
children sounds so unusual we keep thinking maybe its not us we 
waited so many years for this 
sharansky has disappointed those who thought his wit and fluent 
hebrew would turn him quickly into an israeli politician he has 
turned down pleas to join the two major parties 
in january sharanskys name surfaced briefly as a possible 
candidate for israels ambassador to the united nations 
his supporters contended his international stature as a human 
rights campaigner would help improve israels image at a time when 
it was being criticized for mistreating palestinians 
however opponents appeared to win out arguing that his 
appointment would sour a thaw with moscow and that he was 
politically too inexperienced 
sharansky has written a book about his life and along with 
working for soviet jewry speaks out for more tolerance between 
religious and secular jews a problem that dogs his personal life 
with avital 
mrs sharansky is religious and he is not making them an odd 
couple in a country where secular and religious jews usually live in 
separate neighborhoods 
sharansky thinks religion should be a private matter and lashes 
out at newspaper gossip speculating his marriage could fall apart 
because of religious differences 
i feel like my own bald pate has been conscripted into israels 
kulturkampf or culture war sharansky says people here 
concentrate too much on their differences you have to concentrate 
instead on principles and common aims 
mine and avitals ways about religion are very different i am 
not religious but there are some things i accept that help us build 
a family what i do basically is to observe the jewish teaching of 
maintaining domestic tranquility 
sharansky is also critical of the acrimony and horsetrading 
among the 15 political parties in israels 120member parliament 
id like to see more mutual values and consensus in israel 
he says it also upsets me to see people sacrificing principles 
the most disappointing thing is the intolerance in society with 
that we will have to deal 
sharansky says that one of his problems in coping with what is 
going on in isreal is getting used to having so many choices and 
shades of differences after fighting for so many years against the 
oneparty system in the soviet union 
after you fight a world which is black and white and you know 
exactly what you want and you dont compromise with evil you come 
to the free world where the choices are tremendous and the colors 
are very numerous he says 
one of the multicolored issues sharansky has trouble dealing with 
is the palestinian problem his views are a vague fusion of a 
conservative loyalty to his new country and an overall concern for 
human rights 
during the palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip sharansky has researched israels controversial jailing 
practices which allow imprisonment without trial and complicated 
regulations governing when soldiers may shoot at protesters 
he speaks defensively about what he has learned 
i spoke to leading army people about instructions to soldiers 
about opening fire he says you cannot imagine how many cases 
there are where this is forbidden the poor soldiers cant even keep 
track of all the rules 
because of the nature of this country there are serious human 
rights problems like in every country but a democracy has 
instruments to deal with these problems we have developed a system 
of selfchecks 
before the uprising sharansky also met with palestinian leaders 
in the occupied territories such as faisal husseini of east 
jerusalem but he curtailed most of these contacts after sharp 
public accusations that he was consorting with the plo 
sharansky has resisted pressures from arab groups seeking his 
support by trying to draw a comparision between their struggle for a 
palestinian state and the fight for jewish emigration from the 
soviet union 
to say that because sharansky was against the soviet union this 
should make him against the israeli government this isnt true 
sharansky says there is no parallel between them they are two 
principally different things

editors note nobel laureate william butler yeats died in the 
south of france in l939 but world war ii delayed the return of his 
remains to ireland for almost a decade now on the 50th anniversary 
of his death a great mystery hovers over his grave in ireland did 
the french undertakers dig up the wrong body or just send any old 
body if so where is the irish bard and what does that epitaph on 
his tombstone mean 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
fifty years after his death tourists 
by the busload and in a procession of rental cars pay scant heed to 
the epitaph william butler yeats had carved on his tombstone in the 
little churchyard here 
cast a cold eye 
on life on death 
horseman pass by 
last year 50000 visitors from as far away as japan and 
australia trooped into the church of ireland graveyard under bare 
ben bulbens head the flattopped mountain that like a huge grand 
piano with the lid down echoes the winds and waves of the wild 
atlantic some carried wellthumbed volumes by the nobel laureate 
regarded by many as the sublimest poet of the english language since 
milton 
even on the foulest wettest day if i leave the church open 
someone is sure to come by and sign the guest book says the rev 
robert hayman an american from san francisco by way of seattle who 
is rector of st columbas the rural protestant parish where yeats 
greatgrandfather had served 
record numbers are expected for this years semicentennial 
observance of the poets death in august scholars and lecturers 
from around the world will gather for the 30th session of the yeats 
international summer school 
for something to write postcards home about besides the most 
wild and beautiful scenery under a sky ever loaded and fantastic 
with flying clouds as yeats described it there is renewed 
controversy over whether the poet actually lies beneath the epitaph 
he composed four months before his death in 1939 for certain his 
wife is buried there memorialized by a smaller stone engraved 
george which also mystifies visitors 
like a plague of locusts that question of the wrong body in 
the grave comes up every seven years scoffed aengus cantwell 
presidentelect of the council of the yeats society which 
administers his library and memorial in the old royal bank building 
in sligo willie probably would have enjoyed this morbid joke on 
himself but its very distasteful for his son michael and 
daughter anne to have to go through it all over again 
yeats in declining health sought the warmth of the french 
riviera where he died on jan 28 1939 the outbreak of world war 
ii delayed compliance with his wish to be buried at drumcliff so 
his casket was taken to the little cemetery at roquebrune on the 
heights overlooking menton and monaco in the shadow of the alps 
rumors of what happened there resurfaced last fall when british 
biographer diana souhami was researching the life of dutch painter 
hannah gluck a close friend of yeats she reported finding 
letters from the priest in roquebrune and the undertakers 
casting doubt on who was buried where her version has georgie 
yeats the poets widow consigning his remains to a temporary 
grave which she thought would remain untouched for at least 10 
years instead claimed the writer he was buried in a paupers 
grave with four or five others which was cleared in 1946 and 
all the bones placed in a common ossuary 
biographer souhami said artist gluck and journalist edith heald 
visited roquebrune a year later and were shocked to find no trace 
of yeats grave gluck had friends write to the priest who 
replied that it would be possible to identify the poets remains 
if we empty the entire contents of the ossuary and if we have 
details of distinctive characteristics which will enable us to 
reconstruct the skeleton after painstaking research carried out 
under the direction of a medical expert 
but according to souhami yeats purported remains were 
exhumed and shipped to ireland just one month later much too soon 
to enable the bones to be indentified with scientific precision 
in a letter to the irish times michael yeats a member of the 
irish senate like his father denounced her claims as the greatest 
nonsense he insisted his mother had overlooked the whole 
operation and the remains were measured it is absolutely certain 
that my father is buried in county sligo he wrote i have the 
documentation to prove it 
all of which keeps alive a bizarre and macabre tale of the sort 
william butler yeats would have relished hearing from the farmers 
and fishermen around sligo bay and retelling in glorious ghoulish 
detail in his folk collection titled mythologies even the 
reburial of yeats at a grand state funeral is an enduring chapter in 
the oral history of irelands wild west 
the american critic hugh kenner found this out when he 
interviewed the locals more than three decades after that september 
morning in 1948 when the irish gunboat macha brought the remains to 
galway harbor whence they bumped to sligo past knots of 
schoolchildren standing mute with their teachers along roads never 
built for a poets gliding 
he was told for a fact how the coffin was a substitute 
filled with stones how drunken sailors let the original slide into 
the unplumbed mediterranean also how the macha ran aground in sligo 
harbor before being diverted to galway and how her load whether 
stones or leadencased bones instantly broke the hearses springs 
its almost a tale told by silly willie himself as cantwell 
said sligo people still characterize the poet from his habit of 
walking solitary and often barefoot along the strand at rosses 
point through the woods of lissadell on the lake isle of 
innisfree up tortuous trails to the barren heights of ben bulben 
and knocknarea and the other childhood haunts that echo in his 
lovely lines 
yeats was born in dublin lived much of his life in london and 
died in france yet he always regarded sligo where he spent every 
boyhoood summer as his home his barrister father gave up law to 
become a painter his brother jack was irelands leading artist 
his mothers side of the family the seafaring middletons and 
pollexfens were steamboat captains smugglers and eventually 
prosperous ship owners on whom a poor poet could always depend for 
a free passage home from liverpool

young willie spent many summers with uncle henry middleton at 
elsinore house which had a secret tunnel for the delivery of 
contraband from the beach and the ghost of that smuggling ancestor 
strolling the veranda or tapping at the window pane 
nearby lived bachelor uncle george pollexfen a spiritraising 
medium who imbued yeats with a lifelong infatuation with horoscopes 
seances crystal balls tarot cards telepathy and remembering 
bizarre dreams like the apparition of bernard shaw as a smiling 
sewing machine 
young yeats sat with old people by their turf fires to hear myths 
and legends he later retold in the celtic twilight tales about 
queen maeve buried in the massive cairn near the top of knocknarea 
the warrior cuchulain who fought the horses of the sea in sligo bay 
and the ocuirnin family of gaelic bards with whom he felt a mythic 
kinship when rowing out to their island in lough gill 
yeats set for himself the poetic goal of bringing together 
irelands heroic legends and rural folklore after listening to tales 
told by the likes of one paddy flynn a little brighteyed old man 
who lived in a leaky oneroom cabin on the sligo road and often 
was found under a hedge smiling in his sleep after dancing the 
night away with troops of leprechauns 
the ghostmad lad known hereabouts as old parson yeats 
greatgrandson went off to stockholm in 1923 to receive the nobel 
prize for literature from the king of sweden 
going down the eight fairway at rosses point the cultured golfer 
can see the gray stone walls of lissadell the georgian country 
house of sir henry goreooth also haunted and now open to tourists 
here yeats wrote a tragic poem to the two daughters that begins 
the lights of evening lissadell 
great windows open to the south 
two girls in silk kimonos both 
beautiful one a gazelle 
constance the older of two not the gazelle whose name was eve 
was an impassioned irish revolutionary who was sentenced to a firing 
squad for commanding the forces that held st stephens green during 
the easter rising of 1916 her sentence was commuted to life in 
prison and yeats wrote several poems to her before her eventual 
release 
britain hurriedly executed 16 leaders of the rising including 
the severly wounded james connolly who was carried in a wheel chair 
out to the firing squad and yeats helped canonize them as martyrs 
in a magnificent canto 
farther south along the coast in neighboring county galway is 
coole park where for two decades yeats was the frequent house guest 
of the playwright lady augusta gregory 
the great house in dublin where they launched the irish national 
theater which soon became the abbey theater has been torn down 
but in the walled garden amid the ruins is a huge copper bench 
carved with the initials of yeats shaw sean ocasey john 
masefield the painter augustus john and the abbeys resident 
genius john millington synge 
a few miles away is thoor ballylee the 14th century norman tower 
that yeats renovated as a summer cottage for georgie hydelees the 
22yearold bride he took after years of pining away in impassioned 
poetry for actress maud gonne 
george as she was called in life as well as on her tiny 
tombstone was also a psychic medium who introduced yeats to 
automatic writing 
the tower which figured in the title of two collections of 
yeats verse is now a yeats museum tourists can climb the winding 
stairs to the secret room on the top floor where the couple sought 
contact with the beyond 
george continues to intrigue the pilgrims who ignore yeats 
injunction to pass by the grave 
its the name of his dog pastor hayman has heard many a 
visitor comment 
actually said cantwell yeats had a dog named daniel 
oconnell 
the poet was never comfortable with the laboring class that 
worshiped the liberator but a generation later deserted charles 
parnell although a shrewd businessman himself who cast a warm eye 
on the abbeys box office yeats also professed haughty disdain for 
the merchants who fumble in a greasy till 
the poet said cantwell regarded the peasants as the font of 
irish poetic lore and greatly admired the occupants of the stately 
houses but he didnt care much for those in between 
a sense of romance and adventure propelled the rev hayman 
from st lukes in downtown san francisco to st columbas in rural 
sligo several summers before while based in seattle he had 
swapped pulpits with a limerick clergyman and fell in love with 
ireland when drumcliff became available last march my wife sally 
and i were ready 
going though the parish archives he discovered that the rev john 
yeats the poets ancestor had run up a bill of some 400 pounds 
with the wine merchant in sligo which was a goodly amount in 1846 
so far pastor hayman has had neither the occasion nor the 
collection receipts to match that standard of hospitality his noon 
service on sunday draws a congregation of 55 mostly farming 
people 
but with the advent of summer and the return of the chartered 
buses the parish operates a little tea shop in a shed near the 
rectory and provides toilet facilities 
its really amazing hayman says they come from all over 
france holland germany many from japan and korea if you noticed 
we just had new doors put on the church those lovely brass handles 
were the gift of the yeats society of western australia 
the pilgrims arrive full of awe and sometimes wonder this past 
summer hayman recalls a busload arrived led by a roman 
catholic priest who was totally dumbfounded to find that yeats was 
buried in a protestant churchyard 
the american pastor at drumcliff is called upon time and again to 
explain that enigmatic epitaph i always have to admit i dont 
know what it means some scholars say the poet may be addressing his 
own ghost all i know is you could write a phd thesis on those few 
words

there are men who dress like women and women who 
dress like madonna college students whose nocturnal revelry 
precludes classes before 2 pm theirs is a kinky world of 
acidhouse music designer drugs and sexual antics in the safesex 
era 
manhattan dance clubs are a way of life for club kids in 
their late teens and early 20s many of them from suburbs and small 
towns where an affinity for late hours and bizarre clothes made them 
outcasts 
its about coming from somewhere where youre really not 
accepted says katarina markovic 22 a wouldbe fashion designer 
and club regular from louisville ohio we are here because we 
dont fit in somewhere else 
i started out as an ivy league student at columbia started 
going to clubs and found it was more fun says jeff bankoff 20 
an emigre from a boston suburb who has since transferred to a 
lessdemanding college 
michael alig 21 came to new york from south bend ind to 
attend fordham university but after his introduction to the clubs 
he too transferred to an easier school today he works as a party 
promoter earning 1000 from club owners for each bash he throws 
he chooses his guests from 12 mailing lists of 1500 names each 
devises a theme ranging from hawaiian luaus to television 
commercials hires the entertainment orders the food and plays host 
the most outrageous parties are mentioned in the halfdozen 
periodicals devoted to the club scene or in the gossip columns of 
the daily tabloids good press and fabulous parties provide clubs 
with the reputations they need to attract people who pay 15 a head 
to get in 
in contrast club kids usually get in for free the trick is to 
dress outrageously and know the doorman another source of club 
employment one that pays up to 100 for a threehour shift

19yearold girl in a decollete black dress 
those people are expedited into the clubs explains frank 
roccio who owns the world an east village club they are the 
happening people but aside from that they entertain as well we

on the dance floor illuminated solely by three red track lights 
the crowd boogies to acidhouse music a repetitive fastpaced form 
of disco with little melody lots of computer tones and a generous 
helping of old dance tracks remixed and played at mindnumbing 
volume 
one popular cut by the british band bam bam is called wheres 
your child the musical question is answered with a deep sinister 
echoing laugh and a single word ecstasy 
the reference is to a moodaltering amphetaminebased pill drug 
enforcement administration agents say they cant find ecstasy 
formally known as mdma on the streets in the clubs regulars buy 
it for 20 a hit 
a 23yearold art gallery worker describes a typical evening i 
go to the clubs do ex and go to work tripping the next day 
while some say ecstasy is the club kids drug of choice others 
say it is merely a fad michael musto who covers the club scene for 
the village voice says those who take ecstasy are a minuscule 
portion of the population 
club owner roccio agrees that alcohol is the substance most often 
abused by the club crowd the drinking age in new york is 21 but 
clubs can admit 16 to 20yearolds if they dont serve them liquor 
a law that is often winked at 
but whats more striking in the clubs than either drug or alcohol 
abuse is the highly charged sexual atmosphere women wear leather 
bras as outerwear and skirts that are 10 inches long from waistline 
to hem male gogo dancers wear jockey shorts and sneakers 
musto says the antics sometimes get out of hand in one case he 
says a participant in a wet tshirt contest was nearly gangraped 
by clamoring spectators before she was rescued by her boyfriend 
roccio also sees a new wildness on the club scene i think 
there is a revived sexual awakeningwere going through the 
terrible terrible reality of the aids crisis and like anything 
else were seeing a backlash on the part of the younger people 
he says 
fear of aids dissuades most people from the onenight stands that 
were common on the new york disco scene in the late 1970s and early 
80s instead says musto scanty clothing and xrated entertainment 
constitute a sexual threering circus you cant have sex so you 
can at least watch a bizarre variation 
the club kids are blase despite the nudity and outrageous 
dress people are going home alone says andy anderson 23 a 
native of missouri 
as for the sex antics inside the clubs a 19yearold known on 
the club circuit as julie jewels says it was all in fun it 
wasnt dangerous 
like many club kids jewels has adopted a pseudonym and 
cultivates an image to match she wears a long blonde hairpiece and 
lowcut tight dresses slit up the side often sequined or black 
that she designs herself she came from the soviet union 10 years 
ago and says her father doesnt mind her clubhopping as long as 
she finishes her education at hunter college 
jewels 15 minutes of celebrity have arrived she was recently 
photographed by mademoiselle magazine for an article on clubs and 
she even has imitators known as julie jewels wannabes 
other club kids speak proudly of phone calls from radio programs 
mtv and mainstream magazines for stories on ecstasy and acidhouse 
music but its fame on the club circuit that really counts if the 
person working the door recognizes you youve made it 
roccio the 40yearold father of an 18yearold girl says the 
quest for fame began with the club kids babyboomer parents 
we grew up in a world where everyone was going to be 
exceptional where everyone was going to be someone he explains 
the beatles were just four guys from liverpool elvis was just 
some guy from tupelo 
he adds we made our kids feel they had every right to be 
stars

for shooting to death one of her children and seriously wounding two 
others in oregon now imprisoned in new jersey following an escape

prison officials will allow it and publication of still another 
book about her trial

convicted child killer elizabeth diane 
downs who describes herself as the most hated woman in america 
giggles nervously as she talks of her plans to marry a former police 
officer from oregon 
the 33yearold former mail carrier one of oregons most 
notorious criminals of modern times also smiles a lot when she 
talks about a new book about her trial which is due out this spring 
ms downs was sentenced to life in prison plus 50 years for 
killing her 7yearold daughter and wounding her two other children 
on a rural road outside springfield ore on may 19 1983 an 
appeal of the conviction was set aside without comment on jan 4 
she was transferred to the correctional institution for women in 
new jersey after she escaped in july 1987 by scaling a fence at the 
oregon womens correctional center in salem she remained at large 
for 10 days until she was found with a group of men less than a mile 
from the prison 
prison authorities believe she has less chance of escaping in new 
jersey because she doesnt know anybody here and she would have no 
place to run 
prison guards at clinton say ms downs keeps to herself but 
associates say she thrives on publicity as one guard put it the 
last thing her ego needs is another interview 
she sees a camera and her whole world brightens says ann 
rule a seattlebased author whose book small sacrifices about 
the downs case rode the bestseller list of the new york times for 
25 weeks this year 
i dont believe she has any emotion for her children beyond the 
fact that theyre her possession and somebody took them away from 
her 
prosecutors charged that the children were shot because ms downs 
believed they interfered in her relationship with a boyfriend who 
did not want to be a father 
ms downs contends that a stranger flagged down her car shot her 
and the children she was wounded by a single bullet in the left arm 
what happened the night of the shooting was so horrendous so 
unexpected so unbelievable ms downs said in a recent jailhouse 
interview im very selfdisciplined and i need to have control of 
my own existence i just reached a point of not knowing what was 
real and what wasnt 
cheryl lynn downs 7 was killed fourteen yearold christie ann 
was left handicapped in her speech 9yearold danny is paralyzed 
from the waist down the lead prosecutor in the case lane county 
assistant district attorney fred hugi adopted the children 
ms downs says she spends her time exchanging letters with her 
new fiance whom she described as a former police officer who saw 
her on the oprah winfrey show and wrote her because he felt 
sorry for her 
anybody who would want to be involved with the most hated woman 
in america must be a nut ms downs says but hes not a wacko 
hes genuine 
she declines to indentify the man except that hes a former 
oregon police officer who has since moved to new jersey 
im lucid ive been married before and i said i never would do 
it again but im in love said ms downs who was married for 
eight years to steve downs an electrician and farm laborer 
kim white a state corrections department spokeswoman confirmed 
that ms downs has asked the department for permission to marry the 
man ms white also would not identify him 
she said the couple are in the preliminary stages of applying for 
permission to marry they still must meet with the prison chaplain 
and obtain the approval of the superintendent who submits the 
request to a committee for a recommendation 
new jersey does not permit conjugal visits she added 
ms downs who earned an associates degree in general studies 
while imprisoned in oregon has also completed a book bestkept 
secrets scheduled for release in april by danmark publishing 
based in springfield ore about 75 percent of the 350page book 
will be direct quotes from the trial transcript ms downs said 
a spokesman for danmark says that any profits from the book will 
go to the state of oregon under a law passed in the wake of the 
downs case 
its release surely will spark more discussion of the case but 
ms downs says she doesnt believe her children will suffer if 
people talk about her case 
how could the truth hurt the kids ms downs says i get so 
frustrated when i hear things like thathow can the truth hurt 
anybody unless theyre a liar 
but ms rule says the truth that she observed in the ninemonth 
trial was a guilty ms downs who was pregnant at the time with 
another child who was later put up for adoption 
ive never seen anyone as manipulative as diane ms rule 
says describing her as sociopathic histrionic and narcissistic 
i think she knows what she did ms rule says the truth is 
buried so deep that she doesnt have to think about it shes not 
crazy though 
but ms downs denies her guilt and says the bonds between her and 
her children remain 
theyre part of my body that broke away she says they 
love me but at the same time theyre uncomfortable with ever being 
with me again

editors note louisiana chef paul prudhomme put the redfish in 
dire peril when he spread the word across the land how good they 
were blackened in a hot skillet with cajunstyle hot spices not to 
worry enterprising fish farmers are now learning how to grow them 
domestically not unlike the way catfish are farmed 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
its enough to make a cajun drool 
robert hunt has millions of pounds of redfish he has baby 
redfish and 40yearold monsters and all sizes in between 
down a sandy road a couple of miles from the beach hunt has 
redfish growing so fast in 31 acres of ponds and tanks that he 
thinks theyll take less than two years to go from tiny fingerlings 
to three pounds or better ready for cooking 
hunt is one of several entrepreneurs who hope to save the cajun 
delicacy even the redfish itself from extinction 
it all started when louisiana chef paul prudhomme flipped a 
redfish into a whitehot iron skillet and charred it in deep spices 
setting off a national craze for blackened redfish 
mr prudhomme did a very good job says ted brennan of 
brennans restaurant in the new orleans french quarter blackened 
redfish has become part of the restaurant folklore in new orleans 
along with oysters rockefeller and bananas foster people from all 
over the country want it 
its not just in new orleans that people demanded it it would 
be hard to go into any major city in the country and not find 
blackened redfish on a menu somewhere 
prudhomme says he doesnt understand blackened tuna would be 
just as good 
indeed when the demand for redfish grew great enough to threaten 
the very existence of the species new orleans restaurants changed 
the menu to feature other blackened fish especially other members 
of the drum family 
last year the state of louisiana alarmed by the depletion of 
redfish in the gulf of mexico stopped all commercial fishing 
through 1991 and banned the sale of redfish caught off louisiana 
until 1992 
conservation officials said the redfish catch estimated at 
54000 pounds in 1980 jumped to 54 million pounds in 1986 as the 
cajun craze spread facing predictions that the catch could hit 20 
millions pounds annually concerned federal conservationists stepped 
in and state officials followed suit virtually stopping fishing for 
red drum in the gulf 
after the shutdown demand for the fish grew so that an 
underground market developed leading to arrests at the kitchen 
doors of some of new orleans classiest restaurants 
with that kind of market men like hunt thought it would be worth 
the effort to find a way to farm redfish unique problems 
notwithstanding after all catfish farming has become commonplace 
in louisiana and misssissippi ponds 
but redfish are saltwater creatures that thrive in wideranging 
environments running from spawning grounds in the louisiana marshes 
to far out in the gulf how do you pen up game fish and coax them to 
live and breed in captivity 
hunt had one idea he set up set stainless steel tanks at pass 
christian not far from the louisiana state line other farmers are 
trying submerged cages and blockedoff canals in the louisiana marsh 
at his redfish hatchery inc hunt has created a perpetual spring 
for about a dozen fish they mate regularly in the dim waters of 
three spawning tanks 
when the fingerlings reach a certain size they are transferred to 
ponds which have pure oxygen pumped into them 
hunt says the technique he worked out can produce marketable 
redfish rapidly 
by loading the water with oxygen we can practically watch the 
redfish grow he says 
he predicts the ponds will produce over a million pounds of 
redfish a year averaging three to five pounds each 
hunt says the oneacre ponds cost about 25000 to build not 
including the costs of a well to supply the water but there is a 
potential for profit when sales stopped redfish fillets were 
selling at 535 a pound in new orleans seafood markets 
although redfish will survive in fullstrength sea water or 
barely salty water some salinity is needed and the closer the fish 
farm is to sea water the fewer problems growers experience 
in st mary parish the salt comes from a pool atop a salt dome 
sugar cane farmer walter landry turned 25 acres into a redfish pond 
by drilling a well at the dome and mixing that with fresh water to 
produce the equivalent of sea water 
landry hopes to market redfish from the pond every 22 months 
with his first crop due in midsummer 
another group of investors is raising redfish in abandoned oil 
canals in the south louisiana marsh they are betting that the fish 
will thrive in natural conditions 
efforts to grow a marketable product include blocking off the 
ends of deadend canals and filling them with fingerlings and 
raising the small fish in cages 
we have about 55000 fish in the water in eight cages says 
gary lee of mariculture enterprises inc 
lee says his group has invested 250000 and a lot of sweat in 
the venture but expects to see a profit in the long run 
we should have fish ready to see by the fall he says 
itll be three years until we see any profit but longrange we 
expect it to pay off

editors note to leaders of the feminist movement martha 
griffiths is a legend in her own time a congresswoman instrumental 
in getting the equal rights amendment through congress even though 
it failed to be ratified by enough statesnow 77 and serving as 
michigans lieutenant governor griffiths predicts the era will be 
added to the us constitution this century if the case for the 
amendment is argued on economic terms 
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
feminists are readying a second try at 
ratification of the equal rights amendment but this time theyll 
have to do it without the help of former congresswoman martha 
griffiths 
it was griffiths now michigans 77yearold lieutenant governor 
who stalked the halls of congress to get the 218 signatures needed 
to pull the era out of a house committee and onto the floor for 
debate clearing the way for its eventual overwhelming approval by 
congress in 1972 
but the amendment was ratified by only 35 state legislatures 
three short of the number needed to add it to the us constitution 
i think part of the problem is that its also associated with 
rights for minorities and youd be surprised how much racism there 
still is in this world says griffiths a democrat 
another thing some men resent tremendously the idea of a woman 
coming into their offices and really having a chance at promotion 
griffiths predicts the amendment will be ratified this century as 
young women become more aware of discrimination 
the next time around she says the case for the amendment should 
be presented in economic terms i never had anybody objecting to 
my trying to get more money for their working wives 
she says women themselves are partially to blame for not being 
more aggressive in seeking promotions and asking for equal 
treatment i think a lot of women just wont do it she says 
griffiths now in her second fouryear term as lieutenant 
governor never displayed such reluctance when it came to fighting 
for women 
born martha wright in pierce city mo on jan 29 1912 
griffiths is descended from a family that homesteaded in the area 
my father thought that girls were as smart as boys and he 
encouraged me said griffiths who grew up going squirrel hunting 
alongside the boys outshooting them because of her steady hands 
she attended the university of missouri where she met her future 
husband hicks g griffiths they attended the university of 
michigan law school together graduating in 1940 as the 
institutions first married couple 
after working together for a detroit insurance company the two 
established their own law firm in 1946 they worked on the 
successful gubernatorial campaign of g mennen soapy williams in 
1948 
griffiths was elected to the state legislature and in 1952 ran 
for congress she lost but won the seat two years later and became 
the first woman to serve on the house ways and means committee 
there is where you find how badly women have been treated 
she says of the taxwriting panel 
one of griffiths early targets was social security which she 
said required women to pay in as much as men but paid women and 
their children less benefits when they retired or died 
what kind of nonsense was that she asks rhetorically 
griffiths wrestled with the complexities of social security and 
inheritance tax laws but her greatest achievement involved adding 
the word sex to the 1964 civil rights act 
the effect was to outlaw discrimination against women blacks and 
members of other racial minorities and create the basis for 
countless lawsuits 
her amendment caught potential opponents flatfooted and it 
passed before members of congress knew what they had done 
it was a glorious accident she says it really changed 
america 
feminist leaders revere her 
shes a legend in her own time says marian mccracken former 
president of the national organization for women and michigans 
representative on nows national board 
she understood sex discrimination way before her time way 
before other people did and tried to use her position to do 
something about it says eleanor smeal president of the fund for 
a feminist majority whose goal is to elect more women to public 
office 
griffiths says the push for the era changed womens lives even 
though the amendment did not pass 
scores if not hundreds of acts were passed at the state 
local and federal level eliminating the worst of the 
discriminations she says adding that era opponents thought such 
concessions could blunt the drive for the amendments passage 
griffiths surprised the state in 1974 by deciding against 
returning to congress after her 10th term she said she had tired of 
commuting after two decades 
she was serving on a number of corporate boards earning 360000 
a year when thenus rep james blanchard picked her to be his 
running mate in 1982 
critics say griffiths is getting too old to preside over the 
state senate where she has been known to hush noisy senators during 
debate 
reagan who just left the presidency is a year older than i 
so what are they really talking about what theyre really talking 
about is a woman they object to a woman doing anything she says 
thats really it but when you put it to a vote the people 
accept me 
despite her crusty comments griffith has the air of a 
grandmother with her white hair wrinkled face and slow walk she 
has grandmotherly feelings too carrying pictures of her 
secretaries children in her purse and lining her office halls with 
paintings of children griffiths had no children 
i suppose you dont regret what youve never had but i have 
enjoyed other peoples children she says 
despite her age griffiths keeps a heavy schedule once when 
blanchards office asked for a list of her engagements since taking 
office griffiths staff needed three days to compile an 80page 
list containing 900 speeches 
griffiths hasnt decided whether to remain on the ticket if 
blanchard runs again for governor in 1990

in the basement of the student union building 
at duke university a nervous ellen simon fidgeted in the last row 
of a small dark studio theater 
she sat as far away as possible from her father playwright neil 
simon and her former stepmother actress marsha mason they were at 
duke along with her younger sister nancy to attend the world 
premiere of moon and valentino the first play by the 
31yearold miss simon to make it to the stage 
throughout the evening miss mason leaned forward hanging on to 
each word of dialogue simon kept taking off his glasses and wiping 
his eyes when the play was over and the hearty applause diminished 
the four embraced in the tiny theaters cramped aisle 
it was a special joy that first experience listening to the 
play on stage simon said the next day now we can be more 
objective about it 
moonlight and valentino is personal even painful but like 
her famous fathers plays it also is filled with laughter and like 
simons chapter two and his brighton beach trilogy it 
echoes the playwrights own life 
the play concerns a young woman whose husband is killed in an 
automobile accident and how she copes with his death miss simons 
husband jeffrey bishop an astrophysicist died in november 1987 
when he was struck by a car while out jogging 
for miss simon moonlight and valentino goes beyond her own 
experience 
i feel that the personal aspect is limited to the fact that i 
know what its like to go through intense grief to go through a 
jarring sudden loss and to be left all of a sudden with an 
enormous mountain to climb and not knowing whether you are going to 
make it she said 
the fact is that i did find myself at the bottom of the 
mountain did climb it somehow bolstered by friends family and my 
son andrew i got up there and was changed by not running away 
from the grief but by experiencing it thats what made me want to 
write it 
miss simon who had her own dance troupe and worked as a 
choreographer has always been a writer turning out short stories 
and even starting a novel at age 15 that was the year her mother 
simons first wife joan died of cancer she wrote another play and 
a screenplay before attempting moonlight and valentino neither 
was any good she says 
but her father and emanuel azenberg who produces simons plays 
on broadway encouraged her to continue 
bigger counseled azenberg write something bigger 
simon was more cautious about his daughters writing career 
i think my father was frightened the first time i showed him a 
script miss simon said what if it wasnt good what was he 
going to say to me but he read it and i think was relieved then 
he gave me a lot of criticism 
both the screenplay and that first play remain in her bottom 
drawer unproduced 
not so with moonlight and valentino the play was given a 
reading last july in new york azenberg brought it to duke where he 
teaches a course in the schools drama program for a twoweek 
workshop production in february further development is possible 
probably at stages repertory theater in houston later this year 
when it will come to new york no one is sure 
once i knew why i wanted to write it which was to talk about 
transformation and if pain comes to you dont avoid it almost 
embrace it because there is an opportunity there miss simon says 
once i established what i wanted to say the characters came not 
so much from my life but from the need to create conflict within the 
play 
miss simons heroine rebecca is comforted in her grief by a 
chainsmoking sister a dizzy best girlfriend whose marriage is 
falling apart and an acerbic exstepmother who still cares for her 
former husbands children 
i knew moonlight and valentino couldnt be one womans 
journey miss simon says i knew it had to be four womens 
journeys bring them to a point of realization in their own lives 
theres a line in the play about the house attracting widows of all 
sorts thats what i wanted to write about 
the play also has one male character a handsome house painter 
nicknamed valentino by the women although he has no lines the 
painter is an important part of the play hes a symbol of the 
possibility of a new life a rebuilding after tragedy 
miss simon began writing moonlight and valentino four months 
after her husbands death she finished the first draft in 19 days 
i never let it alone she says i spent 10 hours a day on 
it 
from march until november of last year miss simon plowed through 
nine full rewrites something her father is famous for doing 
the only thing i think she may have gotten from me is the 
attitude toward the work says simon who has had nearly two dozen 
plays and musicals produced on broadway his latest comedy 
rumors has settled in for a long run at the broadhurst theater 
before the first performance simon told his daughter i have a 
note pad and im going to take notes 
he came up to me afterward and said here are my notes 
miss simon recalls it was a blank pad 
now the father ponders how his reputation will affect hers 
shell have to deal with it he says its unfortunate but 
it goes with the territory she has no obligation to be the daughter 
of neil simon its a hindrance to have attention taken away from 
what her work is she doesnt deserve that and i dont think it 
will happen once people see the play 
i think shes going to write more plays he adds 
this is not going to be a oneshot playwright shes just too 
good theres so much in her

many of the main monuments glorify president kim who is hailed 
as the great leader and promote his personality cult 
at the northern entrance to the city one monument similar to the 
arch of triumph in paris commemorates the 76yearold kims role in 
fighting japan the colonial ruler of korea until the end of world 
war ii banners praising kim are ubiquitous 
rising 560 feet above central pyongyang is the tower of the juche 
idea erected for kims 70th birthday the juche idea is kims own 
interpreation of marxismleninism and it stresses political and 
economic selfreliance 
officials talk with pride of the accomplishments north korea has 
made on its own tour guides point out the many new buildings in 
pyongyang reciting statistics on height area and length of 
construction time 
one guide surnamed park said that people throughout the country 
of 207 million have been brought to pyongyang to work on the youth 
festival projects park was unable to give exact figures but a 1987 
report in the hong kongbased far eastern economic review said 
100000 soldiers had been diverted to build the kwangbok 
liberation sports complex and other projects 
park said that the average monthly salary in pyongyang is 150 won 
67 housing medical care food and education are free or 
provided at a nominal charge the seoul government puts the average 
monthly income of individual workers in south korea at about 740 
the north lags far behind the south in industry and foreign 
trade with seoul joining hong kong singapore and taiwan as the new 
economic dynamos of the pacific rim 
foreign analysts put pyongyangs foreign debt at about 42 
billion and north korea recently was declared in default of its 
overseas loans 
also troubling north korea is its image as having a ruthless 
government 
north korea was blamed for an assassination attempt in october 
1983 on thenpresident chun doohwan of south korea in rangoon 
burma several top seoul officials were killed 
more recently pyongyang was accussed of planting a bomb on a

the first glimpse into the cult of 
president kim il sung comes as soon as visitors get off the plane at 
pyongyang 
they are greeted by a huge portrait of the leader for four 
decades atop the airport terminal that is just the beginning 
many adults in pyongyang wear kim pins on their clothes 
no one will choose not to wear the great leaders picture 
because we all respect him a tour guide named park told a group 
of visitors from hong kong 
when the visitors asked if they could get a kim pin as a 
souvenir tour guide yoon mu ho responded we cannot give it or 
sell it to you because only followers of kim and his juche idea are 
entitled to wear this badge 
the juche idea is the 76yearold kims guiding philosophy of 
political and economic selfreliance 
universities stadiums and squares are named after him an 
impressive 65foot bronze statue of kim graces the pyongyang city 
center the country is dotted with buildings erected to celebrate 
his birthday he was born april 15 1912 or to mark his 
achievements 
at one model school shown to the visitors from hong kong every 
classroom has a picture of kim in a goldcolored frame in a hotel

every hotel room as well as the restaurant 
the great leader also is a constant companion in train and 
subway stations as well as in train and subway cars 
in paintings portraying kim receiving foreign visitors he always 
stands confidently while the guests bow or approach him none of the 
pictures show the disfiguring lump that bulges from his neck 
the official pyongyang sinmun pyongyang news uses slightly 
larger and darker type for kims name while his speeches are 
printed in bold letters staterun television runs documentaries on 
his acheivements regularly the capital is filled with banners and 
slogans wishing the great leader a healthy and long life 
asked what would happen if kim were to die tour guide park said 
we all hope the great leader will live long in our banquets our 
first toast is for the health and long life of the great leader 
kim il sung plans to hand power over to his eldest son 
47yearold kim jong il in what would be the worlds first 
communist dynasty 
official publications began praising the younger kim in 1971 
calling him dear leader the pyongyang news also uses larger 
type for kim jong ils name and wished him a happy new year on feb 
9 during the week of the lunar new year in some places his 
picture hangs beside his fathers 
in the official periodical korea today labor hero choe hak son 
described the role of kim jong il in building a chemical production 
complex the presidents son solved knotty problems and looked 
after our life well so that we could make miraculous achievements 
and perform heroic deeds in construction he wrote 
even kim il sungs parents and grandparents are glorified in 
north korea as part of the revolutionary family tourists often 
are given a tour of mangyongdae the village where the leader was 
born and spent his childhood family pictures and farming tools used

six years after a socialist government took 
office spain has western europes fastest growing economy but also 
its highest unemployment rate the new prosperity has roiled a 
oncestaid spanish society and widened the rift between haves an 
havenots 
spaniards who once spurned ostentation now are frivolous big 
spenders mesmerized by new financial wheelerdealers and highliving 
politicians 
the oncestagnant economy has boomed since 1986 at a 
europeanhigh 45 percent annual growth rate but the unemployment 
rate has risen to 188 percent from 145 percent when the socialists 
took over in 1982 
nearly every sector including moribund steelmaking and 
shipbuilding has returned to prosperity under prime minister felipe 
gonzalezs marketoriented policies aimed at modernizing industry 
moderating wage increases and curbing inflation 
but the administration appears to have been caught off guard by 
growing popular anger over speculation misuse of public funds and 
high living of socialist officials 
spanish society has experienced many and deep changes in its 
structure and institutions in a very short time and this has 
affected the value system in a special way juan diez nicolas 
sociology professor at madrid university wrote in a recent 
newspaper column 
by late 1985 the governments efforts to encourage domestic 
demand to spark an economic recovery started to take effect 
rocketing sales at el corte ingles department store chain whose 
green and white bags are a middleclass symbol have made the 
company one of the nations most profitable 
spaniards bought more than 1 million new cars last year up 16 
percent from 1987 and 30 percent of them were expensive imports 
corporate and bank profits have tripled and quadrupled 
respectively since 1986 while 167 billion from tourism last year 
set a new record for the third straight year 
these revenues helped increase foreign currency reserves since 
december 1986 from 16 billion to 398 billion according to the 
bank of spain 
a cult of money and success like nothing weve ever seen has 
grown up in this country says miguel roca spokesman for the 19 
deputies of the catalan minority party in the 350seat congress of 
deputies the lower house of parliament 
but the boom has left the countrys 27 million jobless out in 
the cold and poverty remains widespread 
the socialist general workers union and the communist workers 
commissions became the bulwark of a social movement demanding the 
government focus on improving the lot of the estimated 8 million 
people living under the poverty line 
secretary general nicolas redondo of the general workers union 
once a key gonzalez ally has accused the socialists of 
undermining public morality the patrimony of the left 
before it was said that making money was creating wealth and 
jobs he said now it is said that making money is an end in 
itself we are putting aside values such as work dedication and 
saving 
gonzalez took office promising the countrys 39 million people a 
higher standard for ethics in government 
but criticism has rained down on his party following allegations 
that former administration members have peddled their influence as 
highpaid consultants to foreign investors 
pilar miro resigned in disgrace as state television director 
after being forced to pay back nearly 35000 of budget money she 
used for clothes to wear to public functions 
the press questioned why the ministry of defense bought defense 
minister narcis serra a baby grand piano for his madrid apartment 
former economic minister miguel boyer the architect of the 
successful socialist austerity plan raised public hackles with his 
hobnobbing with the rich and fudging property assessments on a new 
residence he is building 
government spokeswoman rosa conde calls these incidents 
anecdotal 
socialists have shown sufficient honesty she said and the 
citizens know that 
the influential roman catholic bishops conference has backed 
union charges and repeatedly criticized the government for creating 
an environment in which selfish materialism is held as superior 
to social solidarity 
public anger has also risen because of the strain on the 
countrys already inadequate social services and infrastructure 
which many claim have been neglected because of the governments 
desire to hold down public spending 
when governmentunion relations soured late last year the unions 
called a general strike for dec 14 to pressure the government to 
make a move to the left the strike shut down the country for a 
day as 8 million of the nations 12 million workers stayed off the 
job 
the strike stood spanish politics on its head as the government 
found itself rejecting demands from a socialist union to which it 
has been intimately tied while centrists and rightwing 
conservatives cheered the unions on 
six weeks of talks collapsed feb 7 with the unions rejecting as 
insufficient a government offer of 33 billion in unemployment 
pension and minimum wage benefits over the next two years 
more recently rumors swirled that gonzalez would resign 
communists demanded that he step down and centrists called for 
elections earlier than june 1990 when they are required 
but when gonzalez delivered his annual stateoftheunion address 
feb 14 he assailed the unions for rejecting the governments 33 
billion offer 
although a recent poll in the newsweekly cambio 16 indicated that 
support for the socialists had dropped to 35 percent from the 44 
percent in 1986 gonzalez pledged to maintain his policies to 
sustain economic growth that is fundamental for the creation of 
jobs 
sociologist maria angeles duran says the biggest change and the 
biggest problem caused by spains muchheralded entry two years ago 
into the european economic community will be the change in values 
in a still profoundly roman catholic nation brought on by the 
growing influence here of individualist and mercantilist values 
flowing from protestant northern europe 
the boom brought forth a new breed of young aggressive 
entrepreneurs bankers and financiers some of whom have became 
household names by introducing the hostile takeover and merger deals 
to the staid spanish business world 
the socialist administration encouraged new blood in top posts in 
business it also encouraged giant bank mergers even hostile ones 
as necessary to improve spains ability to meet competition that 
will come with the european economic communitys removal of internal 
trade barriers by the end of 1992 
business news has overtaken stories of ideological politics in 
the serious newspapers readership in the few business dailies has 
increased to the point where the papers themselves became targets 
for takeover by domestic and foreign investors 
spanish publishers plan to launch two more business newspapers 
this year 
us european and japanese firms and investors have sought to 
create a base for eec access in spain and many have bought out 
spanish companies entered jointinvestment arrangements or built 
their own plants 
direct foreign investment exploded from 1983 to 1988 going from 
1 billion to last years 4 billion 
but great fears remain that the socialists inability to reach 
accords with the unions will lead to demonstrations and strikes 
through the month of may 
already top leaders of the general workers union are calling for 
a debate on whether it should maintain its traditional support for 
the socialists in the next elections

the sandbags are gone in basra iraqs second 
largest city after years of battering by the iranians in the 
persian gulf war a new city is rising from the rubble 
its going to be the best city in iraq said a bank manager 
who identified himself only as simon everythings going to be 
new 
the scars of ferocious iranian missile attacks and artillery 
bombardments are still everywhere shrapnelscarred buildings 
groves of decapitated palm trees abandoned tanks sunken ships in 
the shattalarab waterway that meanders through the city to the 
persian gulf 
but the souk or market is booming the sheraton hotel on the 
bank of the muddy shattalarab peppered by direct shell hits and 
deserted for the last two years opened for business again in 
february 
it was a dispute over territorial claims to the stattalarab 
that led to the war in 1980 
the two daily flights from baghdad iraqs capital to basras 
newly reopened airport are packed with businessmen including 
construction engineers who have come to lobby officials for 
contracts 
on a recent visit president saddam hussein criticized the slow 
pace of rebuilding in a city that symbolized iraqs defense against 
six years of iranian offensives 
the people of basra deserve their city to be beautiful and more 
organized he said 
his government has pledged 5 billion to repair the damage and 
make basra the centerpiece of a new international industrial zone 
founded 1400 years ago and known as the venice of the east 
because of its network of canals basra was iraqs main port with a 
prewar population of 15 million it is just 15 miles from iran 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis iranian forces battled to within 
six miles of basras eastern outskirts in early 1987 putting it 
within easy artillery range 
in the bombardments 90 percent of basras buildings were 
destroyed or damaged thousands of civilians were killed or wounded 
and thousands more fled 
the port is still blocked because the shatt alarab is an issue 
in the iraniraq peace talks 
the first major construction project nearby is 23 new piers for 
what were minor ports at um qasr and khour elzubiar before the war 
the main work in basra since the aug 20 ceasefire has been 
clearing the wreckage 
arfan one of the engineers looking for contracts in basra 
noted right now theyre just cleaning up but by the end of the 
year there will be lots of work in basra 
heavy trucks graders and cranes many of them from the military 
growl through downtown hundreds of new apartment buildings 
ringed by fields of mud have gone up 
many were occupied even before they were completed with 
residents using corrugated iron sheets to cover the stillempty 
windows 
in the souk merchants say they cant keep up with consumer 
demand even though prices have gone up by as much as 25 percent 
were selling more and more said mohammed aslan mohsen who 
runs an appliances store 
at the sheraton hotel manager william meuree a belgian said it 
took two days of cleaning the rugs before the colors started to 
emerge from the dust 
the sign above the entrance hangs askew and the acne of artillery 
hits across the front of the building is still visible under 
concrete patches 
meuree said 99 percent of the damage from several direct hits has 
been repaired and 130 out of the 210 rooms reopened 
visitors from baghdad and kuwait come for the weekend many want 
rooms looking out over three sunken freighters in the shattalarab 
the estuary of the tigris and euphrates rivers that runs into the 
persian gulf at least 70 ships are stranded there 
unfortunately there arent enough rooms on the river to satisfy 
everyone said meuree 
basra had a prewar reputation for serendipity as kuwaits escaping 
their nations alcohol ban made it their weekend watering hole 
theyre coming back slowly its not like before said 
khamis the sheratons bartender who estimated that he serves 50 
people every weekend night they come to drink to enjoy 
themselves 
down the road from the sheraton a new nightclub has opened 
surrounded by a wall of plants and black statues of naked women 
in the neighborhood behind it residents said everyone who fled 
the shelling is back 
dawla a 49yearold mother of seven fled in 1986 after bombs 
shattered every window in the house and killed a man praying in the 
neighborhood mosque 
the house was missing walls and was partially looted when she 
came back after the ceasefire but its been rebuilt 
if theres a war again ill never leave my house she said

in yakima wash the dea office covering 11 largely rural 
counties made 143 arrests last year the only thing that keeps it 
from being greater is manpower and money dreisbach said 
in georgia three americans and six panamians last year were 
convicted of or pleaded guilty to importing about 161 kilos of 
cocaine from panama via us army planes commercial flights or 
mail packages sent to moultrie ga the drugs were then sent to new 
york officials said three of the nine had army ties 
this case is about as hometown as you can get said bill 
malarney agentincharge of the dea office in columbus ga youd 
expect a big city to have these problems but this is a small 
southern town and here you were having cocaine delivered in the 
mail 
despite the large number of arrests most rural drug cases are 
smaller but still take considerable manpower in dodge county 
minn for instance undercover officers spent three months 
arranging the purchase of 25 pounds of marijuana from two men who 
were charged in december 
prosecutors acknowledge many of these cases wouldnt make it into 
urban drugclogged courts 
a lot of what we do here wouldnt be prosecuted in miami 
said murphy the iowa prosecutor a kilo of cocaine is of no 
special significance for miami los angeles or a border state 
there are other differences rural authorities dont have to 
contend with heavily armed bigcity gangs and may benefit from 
smalltown residents less tolerant of drug dens in their towns 
ironically though the everybodyknowseverybody network makes 
it harder for undercover agents to operate even on rural roads 
theyre quickly noticed 
its harder to sneak up on the guy malarney said youre 
talking about a quarter of a mile between houses and theres one 
road 
but smalltown dealers also know how to be inconspicuous 
they dont drive a cadillac stevens said theyll drive a 
pickup truck you dont see diamonds and gold everybody knows 
them for 20 miles how can they show up with a 20000 car and build 
a 100000 house theyre just socking it away 
if people think they can move to rural areas to get away from 
drugs theyre wrong he added theres no place else to go 
anymore

two years ago author joseph wambaugh was 
intrigued by newspaper accounts about how the murderer of two 
teenage girls in england was discovered through a new process of 
identification called genetic fingerprinting 
the writer of the bestselling police stories the onion 
field and the choir boys headed for leicester the english 
city where the murders took place he conducted extensive interviews 
with local police the victims families and others and used the 
information for the basis of his new book the blooding 1895 
william morrow a nonfictional account of what happened 
but the books graphic details of the rapes and murders of lynda 
mann and dawn ashworth have prompted leicester police to look into 
how wambaugh acquired his information they said the blooding 
contains distasteful details that could cause further distress 
to the families involved 
wambaugh seemed visibly shaken by the investigation when he 
talked about the issue in a recent interview 
its very upsetting its keeping me up at nights said the 
52yearold writer 
im worried that the parents once they start down the slope of 
publicly complaining about the treatment of their private lives 
will not be able to retreat back to common sense when they read and 
understand what ive done 
chief constable michael hirst of the leicester county police has 
written to the books british publishers bantam about the books 
closely detailed description of the attacks on mann and ashworth 
both 15 when they died 
the parents of one of the girls had complained to hirst and to 
avoid any suggestion that the police endorsed the book hirst asked 
bantam to remove an acknowledgment of the constabularys help from 
the book 
bantam said hirsts letter arrived after the book was printed 
and it was too late to remove the acknowledgment 
wambaugh contacted robin and barbara ashworth but has been unable 
to alleviate the situation 
im trying desperately he said ive written two letters 
and have gotten one response which was not good from my point of 
view i just feel that robin ashworth has gone down the road too far 
with the poisoned atmosphere and will be unable to read the work 
objectively 
as we sat and talked together repeatedly they uttered the same 
things that its not knowing thats the most awful thing very 
often we let our imaginations run wild and if we know we can lay the 
ghosts to rest and finish it off well i told them what happened 
on the evening of nov 21 1983 mann was raped and murdered in 
the village of narborough while walking down a dark footpath called 
the black pad despite an exhaustive police investigation the 
murderer was not captured and the incident faded into the background 
but nearly three years later the killer struck again this time 
in broad daylight when dawn ashworth was raped and murdered while 
walking on a village footpath called ten pound lane police 
received a tip about the suspicious behavior of a kitchen porter a 
confession was obtained and the case seemed to be finally settled 
however the kitchen porters father had read about a scientific 
breakthrough called genetic fingerprinting developed in the 
mid1980s by leicester geneticist alec jeffreys who discovered that 
every persons blood or semen has a genetic code as distinctive as a 
fingerprint 
a sample of the kitchen porters blood was taken and the test 
showed that his genetic print did not match the semen samples taken 
from the bodies of the two girls 
the police launched a massive blooding program testing every 
male in the vicinity who was born between jan 1 1953 and dec 31 
1970 when an employee at a local bakery revealed that he had been 
persuaded by colin pitchfork a coworker to take the test for him 
police tracked down the suspect pitchfork was tested and charged 
with the murders 
wambaugh tells the story in a matteroffact manner the rapes 
are depicted in detail reading like a well prepared police report 
there is no real message in the blooding outside of how 
genetic fingerprinting could revolutionize crime detection and that 
pitchfork was a sociopath incapable of feeling remorse for the 
crimes 
if there was one single british writer doing a book i was going 
to back off i thought its their country their story and one of 
them should do it i didnt want to be some carpetbagging yank 
but the author didnt anticipate certain cultural differences 
especially the british need for privacy 
they are reticent people who consider keeping ones mouth shut 
a major virtue with americans once they start you cant shut them 
up but the brits are different i spent a lot of money on drinks 
for a lot of people to get information i needed ive done a book 
that theyre not familiar with they dont like nonfiction crime 
it does not sell well in england 
wambaughs own interest in the genre came from reading truman 
capotes 1965 classic in cold blood 
there was his book and there werent too many others 
wambaugh said i was impressed that it could be written exactly in 
the style of a novel and be exactly true journalistically 
wambaugh the son of a police officer lived in east pittsburgh 
until he was 14 and his family moved to los angeles at age 20 he 
developed an interest in literature but decided to become a cop 
because he needed a job and the pay was good but he didnt give up 
his desire to write 
the everyday policemans routine is very rarely exciting and 
very rarely satisfying wambaugh said but when id get home at 
night or daytime depending on the shift i worked i started on that 
typewriter then i was challenged 
his first novel the new centurions was released in 1971 
based on his own experiences it was a fictionalized account of a 
los angeles policemans first five years on the force culminating 
with the 1965 race riots in watts 
the book sold well and his next novel the blue knight did 
even better selling over 1 million copies in paperback alone the 
onion field released in 1973 was a nonfictional story about the 
murder of a police officer in an isolated onion field near 
bakersfield calif a critical and commercial success wambaugh 
considered the onion field a major breakthrough 
from onion field on ive really grown said wambaugh who 
retired from the los angeles police force in march 1973 after 13 
years on the force 
he has written 11 books seven fiction and four nonfiction 
theyre both true kinds of writing stylistically i write the 
same i learned that from capote you can write the same as long as 
you have integrity and dont start writing fiction in a nonfiction 
story

cousins 
 
it is indeed a sad indictment of the hollywood movie machine to 
see its growing reliance on foreign films as a source for new 
american movies the adaptation market seems frenzied these days 
with such remakes as three men and a baby and three 
fugitives it seems the creative and innovative spark of the 
worlds greatest movie institution has died 
the latest redo is cousins joel schumachers graceless 
treatment of jeancharles tacchellas charming 1976 comedy 
cousin cousine 
schumacher makes the mistake of trying to closely follow the 
original both open with a rousing family wedding scene in which the 
husband and wife of two different couples meet run off for a little 
sexual fling and leave their respective mates waiting at the 
catering hall for their returns the cuckholded spouses start up a 
harmless flirtation and friendship and eventually have an affair of 
their own 
but where the original danced lightly with the passions and 
eccentricities of french culture the new version applies the thin 
moralistic veneer of an american tv sitcom with idiot level dialogue 
and conviction simply put the french have a different way of 
viewing adultery 
ted danson as compelling in this role as a bottle of warm flat 
champagne plays larry kozinski who is married to tish played with 
airhead finesse by sean young isabella rossellini perhaps cast in 
this movie to give it some sort of continental class and a little 
sunshine is maria hardy an understanding wife and mother married 
to a brutish bore named tom william petersen who sells suburus but 
who likes to say he sells bmws 
the truly comic moments which were many in cousin cousine 
are diluted in cousins by weighty and blunt situations when tom 
realizes maria and larry are also having an affair he confronts 
larry in typical hollywood macho style with if you go near my 
wife again ill kill you petersen is more fred flintstone than 
valentino 
what saves cousins from utter and total oblivion is the 
wonderful patter between larrys father lloyd bridges and his son 
mitch keith coogan grandpa and grandson have a bucolic moment 
over some girlie magazines and the scene in which mitch helps 
grandpa vince prepare for a date with marias mother norma 
aleandro is worth the ticket price and popcorn 
a totally unnecessary addition to cousins is the subplot 
involving the boygirl problems tom and marias daughter is having 
in preschool who cares 
perhaps hollywood will one day realize that some things get lost 
in translation one would think the lesson would have been learned 
in 1983 when jim mcbride remade jeanluc godards classic 1960 film 
breathless into a pathethic and misguided movie it starred 
richard gere who was embarrassing as he attempted to take on the 
role jeanpaul belmondo had created in the original 
something gets lost in the translation as hollywood puts its neon 
wand to french confections 
if it aint broke then dont fix it

tap 
 
movie audiences have yearned for those splashy joyous romantic 
musicals of the 1930s 40s and 50s when boy met girl boy lost 
girl boy got girl back and everybody lived happily everafter 
dancing all the way to the altar 
nick castle whose father choreographed many of those wonderful 
fred astaireginger rogers vehicles attempts to bring back those 
golden dance movies with tap a love letter to hoofers great and 
small 
starring gregory hines and some of the greatest tap kings living 
tap features excellent dancing and a splendid exuberance 
unfortunately the movie holds back the dance sequences never seem 
to totally reach their potential 
one production number in which hines takes a club full of tap 
fans out to times square to feel and hear the beat and rhythms of 
the city such as cars going over metal plates in the road or 
construction crews thumping the pavement and marks out a dance the 
number starts out well luring the viewer to the rhythms and moves 
then it fizzles 
another disappointment is the wistful rooftop soft shoe 
performed by hines and the lovely suzzanne douglas to cheek to 
cheek its a romantic fred and ginger takeoff that never really 
gets off how sad 
the biggest problem with tap is castles script and story 
line max hines is a genius dancer who unfortunately finds 
secondstory work more to his liking than hoofing after a stint in 
jail he returns to new york where he hooks up with the hoods again 
at the same time his mentor little mo sammy davis jr encourages 
him to resume his dancing and even tries to turn him on to a new tap 
innovation amplified shoes 
the plot though gets in the way of the dancing its not 
compelling poignant or interesting enough the tap dancing 
however is 
hines perhaps the greatest contemporary tap stylist around these 
days is marvelous his supporting cast includes savion glover a 
14yearold hoofer who one day will make the same claim 
there are also sandman sims bunny briggs harold nicholas jimmy 
slyde and steve condos some of the dancers who helped define and 
perfect the art and craft of tap during the 20th century 
and douglas who learned how to tap for the movie is quite good 
for a newcomer 
forget about the story see tap as a tribute to the great 
ones and to appreciate what tap dancing was all about before 
broadway and hollywood took away its snap and crackle 
produced by gary adelson and richard vane the tristar pictures

by barry strugatz and mark r burns is a genuinely hilarious movie 
that is full of bravura performances by actors at the height of 
their powers 
pfeiffer who played the icy blond bimbo in scarface and the 
love interest in tequila sunrise is more luminously beautiful 
than ever her character conveys a tough smart innocent 
vulnerability that is magic 
stockwells portrayal of clever weasely tony deserved his 
academy award nomination as did his lunatic cameo as howard hughes 
in tucker so did mercedes ruehl whose crazed connie adds a 
joyously funny intensity to the action 
ever since citzens band as well as melvin and howard or 
stop making sense or swimming to cambodia demme has been 
making important american movies in married to the mob he makes 
one that is pure fun

bellman and true cannon video vhsbeta 8995 rated r 
 
run out and borrow rent or buy this one it was my favorite 
video of 1988 
its an unrelentingly tense caper movie that inexorably notches 
up the tension yet has at its center a beautiful and moving story 
of a father and son 
bernard hill plays a burnedout alcoholic a computer systems 
engineer who takes a bribe to deliver a mysterious computer file to 
a cheeky newbreed london villain derek newark and his 
henchmen 
the engineer and his stepson kieran obrien are held prisoner 
until the file is interpreted and it turns out to be the cash flow 
reports and electronic schematic to the ultrasecure branch bank 
serving heathrow airport 
suddenly it is too late to back out the gang needs a bellman 
to handle the banks electronics and there is a share of 25 
million 
your lifes a bit gray these days isnt it darling says 
the cheeky thug 
considered only for its ingenious caper bellman and true 
would be a worthwhile movie but the relationship of the father and 
son is equally important heightening the sense of value risk and 
loss 
novelist desmond lowden wrote the tight fastpaced screenplay 
from his book with director richard loncraine with michael wearing 
loncraines headlong direction utterly crisp atmospheric and 
breathless enough to get you on the edge of your seat the cast is 
superlative every one 
highest recommendation

flashpoint grp records tom scott 
 
saxophonist tom scott has played it seems with everybody 
a short list of those hes backed includes barbra streisand 
steely dan paul mccartney and joni mitchell he has written scores 
for movies and even the themes for two 1970s tv shows starsky and 
hutch and the streets of san francisco 
in between such projects scott sometimes with his everchanging 
band the la express has found time to make solo records of 
lightweight jazzrock fusion meticulously produced and somewhat 
devoid of any spark 
the same holds true for flashpoint 
the opening cut get a grip sets the tone for the album 
with its uptempo melody overdubbed saxophone solos and shifty 
rhythm scotts penchant for overdubbing tenor and alto saxes 
creates a fuller sound but prevents him from straying too far from 
the melody robbing his solos of spontaneity 
lost in love and night drifter are both moodier slower 
pieces that showcase scotts tenor sax runs while the title cut is 
the most adventurous with its synthesizersaxophone harmony and 
machinelike rhythm 
scott is a talented composer producer and sideman but as a solo 
act he shows little imagination his music while pleasant enough 
begs for something to set it apart from the crowd

tshirt epic the crickets 
 
the first album in years by the crickets is an unexpected little 
pleasure especially if it is approached without lofty expectations 
former buddy holly sidekicks ji allison and joe mauldin are 
joined on tshirt by singerguitarist gordon payne for 10 songs 
that happily dont lapse into sentimental reminiscences or futile 
attempts to recreate the late rockers magic 
they do a good job playing breezy goodtime rock n roll the 
sort of thing holly might be doing today had he lived and stopped 
progressing musically past 1959 
its unpretentious fun and instantly likeable 
one song rises above the rest the paul mccartneyproduced title 
cut its the most overtly hollyesque song here with an 
irresistible handclapping guitarstrumming chorus dont tell me 
that love hurtsi read the book i saw the movie got the tshirt 
the crickets also poke fun at themselves in the bouncy three 
piece noting how many musicians have been in and out of the band 
since holly split from the group shortly before his death 
there have been they sing more crickets than a dogs got 
fleas but weve cut it down to a threepiece then noting the 
advantages of a smaller group the overheads down and the moneys 
increased 
such high points are not sustained over the entire album though 
and the sappy ballad the weekend and the unnecessary car song 
cruise in it threaten to drag things down 
but the crickets make up in spirit for the few weak spots making 
tshirt a wellfitting comfortable record

more than friends jive jonathan butler 
 
jonathan butler is the kind of guy we all used to hate in school 
butler is handsome sings well plays a mean guitar and writes 
catchy songs he probably played on the football team too 
butler puts his musical talents to good use on more than 
friends a collection of 10 tunes that contains few clinkers the 
record is mostly pop part rampb and a little bit of jazz because of 
butlers scat singing and the way he rips through acoustic guitar 
licks his sound is a bit reminiscent of george benson 
the opening cuts theres one born every minute im a sucker 
for you and breaking away both swing and swagger with a 
smile the mood remains upbeat the rest of the way with other 
highlights including the instrumentals take me home and 
sekona butler even turns a few neat phrases as seen on shes 
a teaser 
shell call you up at 2 am says she wants some company i 
tell you this from experience the only thing youll do all night is 
watch tv 
its some consolation that butler occasionally has trouble with 
girls

tom selleck shy 
i think so yeah he says i was terribly shy all my life 
not just as a kid an awful lot of actors i know are shy 
that may help explain part of his enduring appeal first in eight 
seasons and eternal reruns as televisions magnum pi and now 
as the bigscreen star of three men and a baby and the current 
her alibi he may display the outward appearance of a movie 
hero but theres an underlying uncertainty that beguiles women and 
reassures men 
sellecks candid appraisal 
i dont see myself as others do people tell me youre 
willing to play with your macho image youre willing to play with 
that well i never tried to project a macho image 
in fact im six feet four inches tall ive been taller than 
most people most of my adult life i see no reason to run around 
trying to intimidate people with that ive always kind of gone the 
other way 
such an approach seems to be the way for his film career to go 
during hiatus time of the early magnum he starred in three 
films of the heroic mode high road to china lassiter 
runaway all were disappointments though not the dismal 
failures some critics claimed 
three men and a baby and to a lesser extent her alibi 
indicate that the key to sellecks film success lies in stressing 
his fallibilities the new film casts him as a mystery writer who 
becomes involved in a spy plot involving a romanian exchange 
student played by model paulina porizkova 
its a change of pace for me selleck remarked theres a 
lot more physical comedy in this picture and yet as silly as the 
picture gets its the kind of comedy which i think you have to play 
absolutely for real 
the director is bruce beresford the australian who has made 
tender mercies crimes of the heart and other films in this 
country 
bruce seems to be able to translate the american ethic on 
film selleck observed ive gotten to know many aussies in 
hawaii and i think theres a certain kinship between the two 
countries maybe its because were both kind of young civilizations 
in the historical context 
selleck has completed the transition to films with a hefty 
salary his reported fee for her alibi is 4 million has this 
resulted from some grand plan on his part 
i dont think i had the ability to be that calculated he 
said i had some instincts and one picture led to a certain kind 
of logic for what i would do next 
i was concerned about it i was pretty defensive about pictures 
i had done my stock was pretty good all during magnum but it 
wasnt perceived that way with my first three pictures i think its 
because they werent successful in the same magnitude as magnum 
the offers kept getting better all during magnum but nobody 
knew it he said the questions i was asked changed even before 
three men and a baby started making money the questions implied 
that i had successfully made the transition 
growing up shy in the san fernando valley selleck never had a 
desire to become an actor 
i never did a school play i never did anything he declared 
i got into acting because i grew up in the town where the 
business centered and somebody said you ought to try commercials 
i thought you could make money at it good money for very 
little work after i tried it i liked it 
cigarette commercials and ads led to a contract at 20th century 
fox where he learned his craft he freelanced in television then 
landed at universal which cast him in seven failed pilots until 
magnum pi 
selleck remains at universal occupying a suite of offices with 
his production company among his projects is producing a new 
television series for his friend burt reynolds 
last dec 16 sellecks wife actresssinger jillie mack gave 
birth to their first child hannah the 44yearold father remains 
exultant 
hannah is great he said the main reason i thought it was 
time to end magnum was that i felt my priorities were a little 
off while i thought it was well worth making the sacrifice of 
putting work ahead of family for an opportunity like magnum id 
been doing it long enough 
to take care of the new family he bought a 60acre ranch in the 
san fernando valley as well as a home closer to town in mandeville 
canyon 
will there be a three men and a baby ii 
yeah and they disney postponed it which to me is a real 
vote of confidence its encouraging because i think a lot of 
studios would consider their investors and say why delay it you 
could do anything and make a hundred million dollars 
i think disney truly does feel this is kind of a benchmark for 
them a touchstone and they want to take care of it he said 
so when they said were willing to forego next christmas to make 
the script better it says to me they want to make a sequel thats 
better than the first as opposed to ripping off the audience

ask ned livingston what he does and even he has 
a hard time deciding what it is exactly 
theres what he calls this stuff the chairs and other 
furniture he whittles in fluid designs which sell for big money in 
fashionable art galleries in new york and los angeles 
then theres what he calls the land the old gerber ranch 
which he and his wife inherited with its pastures to irrigate and 
timber to manage 
and there are the fish in the pond in front of the house which 
need a handful of chopped liver now and then the redlegged 
partridges which he released into miller creek canyon and the 
klamath county planning commission on which he serves as a member 
you are talking to a guy who is not particularly sure what 
woman he is married to the furniture or the land livingston said 
one winters day at his home which he built in a meadow surrounded 
by ponderosa pine and juniper at the foot of horsefly mountain 
and im not particularly worried about it 
livingston and his wife marilyn were both born and raised in 
this high desert country east of the cascade range ned in klamath 
falls and marilyn on the old gerber ranch which is a good 1hour 
drive from the city 
we came back here in the 1950s after college for a year or 
two he said then we went to the big city looking for a big 
architecture job 
if i had proceeded professionally i would have stayed in san 
francisco but we kept coming back and coming back finally i said 
lets quit looking for ourselves and do what we really want to 
do 
so they moved back to the ranch livingston started gluing up 
pieces of oak and walnut and using a horseshoe rasp to shape 
freeflowing chairs cradles music stands benches coat racks 
library ladders and bar stools the ones he didnt sell stayed home 
it has taken some years to get six chairs around the dining table 
in the 60s i was really hot livingston recalled i was 
going to burn up the art world with these things i had a piece in 
the renwick gallery at the smithsonian the point is i had stuff 
around the country maybe i would sell a piece here a piece there 
it hasnt built into the kind of thing where i didnt need to 
worry about a monthly income then comes the estate breaking up i 
had been involved in the operation of this ranch so the last four 
or five years ive let this stuff slide ive worked on irrigating 
the south 40 or thinning timber 
the land is definitely a conflict with this other stuff he 
said most people arent so fortunate to have that problem it 
would be stupid of me to neglect it 
livingston proudly recites the history of his land which was 
assembled by cattlemen first horsefly wilson and later the gerber 
brothers in the late 1800s out of small homesteads too poor to 
support a family marilyn livingston drives about 15 miles on a 
cinder road to get to the little logging community of bly where she 
teaches school they lease the pastureland for grazing and ned is 
working on expanding the irrigation network to produce more summer 
grass 
he recently cruised several hundred acres of timber where the 
logging outfit wanted to cut all the mature timber livingston left 
enough of the big trees to generate new ones and maintain the 
diversity of the forest 
with 20 inches of snow on the ground hes been able to get back 
to what he calls the wood whittling 
my furniture tries to conform to the shape of the human body 
it ends up kind of sculptural 
one of the hardest things to make is a chair vitruvius a 
roman architect from the first century bc said a building should 
accomplish three things firmness commodity and delight what is a 
chair but the same three things 
livingston has been working on improving his dining chair which 
he considers his signature work and abstractly calls to mind the 
sandhill cranes that breed nearby the bad thing is the scoop seat 
makes it hard to get in and out of he says 
the sketch of his latest idea is in the middle of his notes from 
a meeting where a state planning official explained some new 
regulations aimed at stopping the fragmentation of oregons farm and 
forest lands 
in his shop an early chair a prototype for a collasible 
cathouse jigs horse collars bicycles and a small hydroplane one 
of his two sons built hang from the ceiling on a work bench a 
portable radio propped on a milk can plays classical music 
at another bench livingston is freeforming a curved lamination 
that will form the splayed legs and support the seat of the new 
dining chair 
this is the fun part about designing by the seat of your 
pants he said you think you know where youre going but you 
dont 
if you look at it youre looking at the bone and sinew and all 
the rest of the mass is subtracted i get more of a feel for what 
makes that baby work 
livingston was intrigued by a suggestion some time back to make 
the chairs out of injectionmolded plastic 
the way i work with the material i tend to make the wood into 
a plastic material he said you look at a tree limb sticking 
out from the trunk and if that isnt a plastic process i dont 
know what is wood is basically a bunch of bendable fibers 
it would be easier to pour the stuff into an injection mold and 
spit out one of these chairs every two hours in any color you want 
and walk laughing to the bank 
though it takes 40 hours to whittle one of his dining chairs out 
of wood livingston finds it more friendly than plastic 
it has an inherent warmth about it thats hard to duplicate in 
plastic he said even a warm color in plastic is cold whereas 
wood you want to touch wood feel it

the words like ethereal despairing melancholy 
and dolorous that mark reviews of the cowboy junkies tip off right 
away that this is not your average pop group 
so learning that vocalist margo timmins apartment on one of 
torontos trendiest streets is unmarked and hidden away behind some 
offices should not come as a surprise 
thats the way i like it she says with a bit of a grimace 
when told the address for the scheduled interview was hard to find 
the publicity machine of the pop music industry is gearing up to 
promote one of its unlikeliest recent hits the cowboy junkies 
the trinity session recorded in one day in november 1987 at the 
church of the holy trinity in toronto 
the album whose production cost was 250 includes eerily 
stretched out sparse versions of hank williams im so lonesome i 
could cry lou reeds sweet jane and patsy clines walking 
after midnight 
some haunting originals are included as well such as misguided 
angel and 200 more miles 
in the last two months ive done more interviews than most 
people do in a lifetime the 28yearold timmins said taking a 
break from packing for a long tour that includes a new york stop to 
perform on saturday night live 
its just a matter of getting used to it she said with a 
laugh its like everything everythings happened so quickly 
her 29yearold brother michael and his childhood friend alan 
anton came back to toronto after stints performing to little acclaim 
for a few years in new york and england they started rehearsing in 
the garage of timmins younger brother pete then brought him into 
the band to play drums margo joined to do vocals 
but not only didnt she see herself as a singer she also was 
concerned that a band with too many family relationships could cause 
strains its worked out really well mike and i really work well 
together she said 
settled in for a conversation with emmylou harris new record 
playing in the background she said its an honor for me to sing 
his songs 
the band has been together since 1985 but publicity swelled last 
year after rca released the trinity session in the united states 
and enthusiastic reviews started appearing 
the music generally is pegged as countryblues with a touch of 
the velvet underground 
the los angeles times critics poll found it the best pop album 
of 1988 beating out u2 tracy chapman and prince times critic 
robert hilburn called them mesmerizing 
michael timmins phones to check if the interview is running 
smoothly or if an explanation of how the cowboy junkies picked their 
name is needed but margo tells him its already been discussed 
she said the name was chosen because an independent band 
especially in canada with its smaller market needs anything it can 
get to attract attention i think it did us well at that level 
she said its still generating a lot of interest 
with the addition of three sidemen the band has swelled to seven 
theres been some local sniping about the cowboy junkies success 
outside of canada where record companies generally have limited 
slots that go to bands aimed squarely at the mainstream 
yes i think thats really unfortunate that you have to go 
across the border to get recognized but you have to be realistic 
said timmins her shock of light hair pulled back i am in the 
american market its the facts of life but no ones going to get 
me to say that im an american band 
whatever makes us canadian is in our music i dont think were 
flag raisers were much more laid back 
she also has limited patience for those who criticize their music 
if you like it fine if you dont dont listen she said 
i cant really put my finger on what were doing it surprises us 
a lot of it is spontaneous 
the slow pacing of the music and the bands quiet demeanor during 
performances can take some getting used to 
its definitely on some weird edge and theres the danger of 
falling off at some point michael said in an interview with the 
canadian press news agency weve never attempted to be a country 
band or a rock band we just play and this melancholy sound comes 
out 
weve just found when we slow a song down it starts to make 
more sense margo said it leaves us much more room for 
interpretation 
its a big challenge to play slow youre asking a lot of the 
audience she said theres also the risk that when it doesnt 
work its dull and im not ashamed to admit it 
the decision to record in a church was made for the sound and 
timmins noted that the the trinity session was centered 
consciously around the vocals 
we knew that the church would bring out the best of my voice 
she said laughing singing in a church does a lot for your 
vocals 
the next album will also be recorded live over a period of time 
in different locations 
when you record live the room is an acoustical instrument 
she said

as a youngster aspiring musician floyd 
cramer would agitate his piano teachers by playing by ear rather 
than learning to read music 
despite their protests cramer became the best piano player in 
the small sawmill town of huttig ark in fact he went on to become 
one of the most famous in the world 
in a career spanning more than 30 years he played on many of 
elvis presleys records and movie soundtracks his millionselling 
hit last date became a piano standard he even developed a piano 
technique often referred to as the slip note style 
today hes seen often in tv ads selling such albums as world 
famous love songs and treasury of favorites hes sold more 
than a million copies through tv marketing alone in the past three 
years 
prior to making records for sale by television he spent 23 years 
with rca records and joined guitarist chet atkins and sax player 
boots randolph as nashvilles bestknown instrumentalists hes 
recorded more than 50 albums 
all this came from a bashful kid who disliked practicing 
exasperated his teachers and still admits that classical music is 
beyond his limits 
he still doesnt like to practice he even avoids the term 
preferring to call it playing some call it practice i call 
it play thats because i enjoy it practice i dont enjoy 
regardless of what he calls it cramer has been stroking the 
ivories since his parents bought a spinet piano when he was 5 
i had some lessons but i just wasnt interested the 
55yearold musician recalled it was the confinement i guess 
but i enjoyed playing by ear the teachers got upset because i 
learned it by ear 
by age 15 he was playing and traveling with country music stars 
such as webb pierce and faron young in his early 20s he was 
playing piano on a flatbed truck and in school auditoriums on a tour 
of texas featuring a young singer named elvis presley 
cramer later played on most of presleys records and in his 
movies including blue hawaii girl happy and roustabout 
he was always nice to us cramer said about the recording 
sessions he enjoyed the musicians and felt very comfortable 
cramer has 6 and 9yearold granddaughters who have become 
presley fans 
his last date in 1960 is still heard on radio stations 
playing golden oldies and the tune has been learned by 
thousands of young piano students who werent even born when cramer 
wrote and recorded it 
its a simple melody he said its good exercise for both 
hands you are playing solid left hand patterns and a dominant 
melody with the right hand its different and fresh to most piano 
students 
the song has found its way into american ceremonies also 
ive had people tell me theyd like to have it played at their 
funeral cramer said and others say theyd like to have it 
played at their wedding about two weeks ago someone said it was 
played at the altar call at church so it means different things to 
different people 
in 1984 at the request of michael jackson cramer played piano 
at a birthday party for jacksons mother because he is her favorite 
musical performer 
cramer quoted the young rock superstar as saying hed been 
listening to last date all his life and that cramers music had 
influenced his style 
the song has been very good to me im proud of it i play it 
every chance i get cramer said 
his style of playing is slurring or bending notes its sort of 
a nearmiss on the keyboard they call it everything he said 
some call it a mistake with a quick recovery 
he describes his own gift as being able to play with feeling 
to interpret a mood of a song but he acknowledges some 
shortcomings 
im not good at classical some i wouldnt dare try because 
its beyond me some would say its beyond my capabilities 
technique or training or my mind of comprehension but i know my 
limits thats the key 
nevertheless he still learns just about every time he sits down 
at one of the three pianos he owns 
i learn something all the time a different way to play certain 
things different songs and melodies contribute to that 
does he sing 
just for my own amusement he said

scientists are studying a way to tag 
smokestack pollutants much the way biologists tag birds and animals 
as part of research into pinpointing the chemicals that contribute 
to acid rain 
in tests begun last summer w robert kelly of the national 
institute of standards and technology and university of maryland 
aerosol chemist john ondov injected an enriched or strengthened 
isotope of the metal neodymium into smoke from a coalburning power 
plant in northern virginia 
analysis showed that air filters at sampling sites in an arc from 
bethesda to landover detected the release of the enriched isotope 
20 kilometers from the power plant kelly said the experiment 
proved we can inject it into the smokestack take samples into the 
lab and detect the effect 
kelly and ondov are seeking an environmental protection agency 
grant to study whether the particle tracing will work over longer 
distances the epa is testing isotope tracers in diesel fuel used by 
public vehicles in roanoke va 
plants could be injected with different isotopes to help track 
the pollutants each one produces imagine each isotope is a colored 
ping pong ball kelly said you can count the relative numbers of 
blue green and red balls and say aha the plant in town a even 
though it is further away is the source of 10 times the number of 
balls as the plant right next door 
acid rain is formed from sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide 
released by the combustion of coal and other fossil fuels in 
combination with water they form nitric acid gas and sulfuric acid 
droplets which dissolve in rain 
the research was funded by the utility industrys electric power 
research institute and marylands power plant topical research

the defense nuclear agency 
hopes to start testing the durability of military equipment by 1994 
in a 74 million device that will simulate the heat and shock waves 
of a nuclear blast 
the blast simulator will consist of a 894footlong tube 66 feet 
in diameter connected to a test chamber big enough to hold a tank 
or helicopter said spokeswoman cheri abdelnour the other end of 
the tube will be fitted with nine highpressure valves that will 
create a shock wave of compressed nitrogen torches burning oxygen 
and aluminum powder will create short blasts of heat 
the device will be able to bombard objects with energy as strong 
as 600 kiloton blasts 30 times the power of the bomb that 
devastated hiroshima 
construction could start in two years at a site on the northwest 
corner of the missile range chosen after a yearlong study 
abdelnour said

an archaeologist who went to africa to test 
stone tools used 11000 years ago in north america says modern 
painting of mammoth hunts are based largely on misconceptions about 
the hunters abilities 
paintings dioramas and even textbooks often show mammoths up to 
their tusks in swamps with hunters rushing around waving spears and 
yelling said george frison and usually somebody being trampled 
to death 
this almost certainly was not the typical hunting method of 
clovis cultures that lived in the wyoming area said the university 
of wyoming professor 
the short spears and lances found at clovisperiod sites could be 
used to kill and skin mammoths frison said but the hunters 
probably went after young stray animals to avoid facing charging 
herds of the 15000pound creatures 
assuming that mammoths had a social structure similar to african 
elephants a clovisculture hunt would probably proceed very 
differently elephants have a strong family structure in which the 
matriarch is protector of the herd at the sign of danger the 
matriarch will charge six or more tons of enraged elephant bearing 
down on the hunter armed only with a stonetipped spear youre 
not going to down a charging matriarch with clovis weaponry 
frison said 
consequently the only way clovis hunters could routinely have 
killed mammoths would be by going after younger animals away from 
the herd hunters would have worked in pairs one distracting the 
animal without threatening it and the other sneaking up on it to 
deliver the fatal wound he said they would then hide until the 
animal died and the herd left 
frison testing his theories on dead elephants in zimbabwe found 
that clovis spears and lances could pierce an elephants hide from 
60 feet a spear that pierced a mammoths lungs would probably kill 
it within minutes while one that pierced the stomach would take 
hours to days to cause death he said 
frison said no one can really know the clovis techniques but that 
this is more likely than the screaming tribal charge often depicted 
by artists 
clovis really represents the development of true hunting 
weaponry frison said a conclusion he admits is controversial 
among those who studied early humans in europe africa and asia 
if youre really talking about the kind of hunting that one or two 
hunters bring down a mammoth he said it developed in the new 
world

leprosy treatment has come a long way since 
the days when victims of the disfiguring disease were forcibly 
detained here 
hansens disease can be treated almost exclusively on an 
outpatient basis now and the director of the only leper colony in 
the continental united states plans to phase out the antiquated 
facility set up when victims were outcasts 
but dr john c duffy doesnt intend for the work of the gillis 
w long hansens disease research center to be lost as its buildings 
age along with its 140 permanent patients who average 65 years old 
one outgrowth of leprosy research has led to help for diabetics for 
example 
our research is outstanding but our physical plant is a 
disaster said duffy citing an office of management and budget 
study he wants to move the centers acute care research and 
education functions to baton rouge 
the colony was opened in 1894 on an old plantation when the state 
ferried five men and two women up the mississippi river under cover 
of night from a new orleans pest house the federal government 
took control in 1921 and as many as 500 permanent residents were 
housed during the 1930s most of the 330acre complex of white 
plantationstyle buildings connected by a maze of enclosed walkways 
was built during the 30s by the works progress administration 
it was a very different patient population duffy said 
they were young nonimmigrant and they were mainstream 
americans 
leprosy victims were arrested and forcibly detained here until 
after world war ii when drugs were found that stopped the 
contagiousness and progression of the disease over time fewer 
patients took up permanent residence 
the center which has treated nearly 3000 patients survived 
when the reagan administration in 1984 closed seven other hospitals 
operated by the us public health service the late us rep 
gillis w long spearheaded a drive to save it but federal officials 
suggested research be done by either the centers for disease control 
or the national institutes of health 
leprosy a bacterial infection attacks the skin flesh and 
nerves and is characterized by scabs deformities and eventual loss 
of sensation there are an estimated 6000 to 10000 us cases but 
up to 20 million worldwide 
we will continue to receive men women and children with this 
disease its not an excludable disease duffy said you can 
have it and you can come into this country because the incubation 
period is sometimes six to eight years somebody can come into this 
country with no idea they have the disease 
research needs to continue at the center he said for one thing 
the work takes hundreds of armadillos the only nonhuman animal that 
gets the disease and there is no room at either cdc or nih for 
the armadillos 
also all the experts are here they are not in bethesda or 
atlanta 
the center could take rental space in baton rouge without 
increasing its 18 million annual budget he said 
all major advances in leprosy treatment drugs 
armadillorelated discoveries and two generations of vaccines with 
limited effectiveness came from carvilles researchers said 
duffy who fears that research would be downgraded if it was moved 
to another agency 
its one of the paradoxes of the disease that as far as 
scientists are concerned their interest is almost always elsewhere 
than on this disease he said its not the kind of research for 
which you will win a nobel prize 
as a result the scientific community has paid scant or little 
attention to this disease there is this group that has almost in a 
sense religiously dedicated their lives to this disease that are 
centered here 
but even the worst cases discovered today can be handled through 
one of 11 regional treatment centers or by private doctors for 
example a victim whose disease progressed while he was confined in 
a cambodian prison is undergoing outpatient treatment in san 
francisco 
thalidomide notorious for causing congenital birth defects is 
one drug that controls the disease the drug of choice is 
diaminodiphenyl sulfone first used in leprosy treatment in 1941 by 
dr guy faget at carville two other drugs rifampin and 
clofazamins have been tested successfully in recent years and 
research continues because the bacteria is becoming resistant to 
sulfone drugs 
new admissions to carville are mostly patients with reactions to 
the drug treatment or have diagnostic problems after a few weeks 
they go home 
research into the loss of feeling in hands and now is being put 
to work for diabetics who often require amputations after foot 
injuries stemming from the lack of sensation in their extremities 
about 500 diabetics have been treated here for foot problems such 
as ulcers with special casts that allow healing and mobility said 
dr charles patout chief of rehabilitation the techniques weve 
developed here could reduce the number of amputations among 
diabetics about 50000 a year by 90 percent 
of the diabetics treated at carville only two have undergone 
amputations 
duffy would like to see more diabetics take advantage of 
carville but he admits the stigma of leprosy may keep many patients 
from coming to the center that is another reason to move treatment 
facilities to baton rouge 
as far as the permanent colony residents are concerned the 
federal government should continue to care for them at carville he 
said especially because of the traditional stigma private 
nursing homes wouldnt take them what i would like to do is leave 
that population right here and provide them all the resources of a 
longterm care facility

barbara blodgett was in a coma when she gave 
birth to a healthy eightpound son in december nancy klein remains 
in a coma after her husband won the right to abort her 18weekold 
fetus earlier this month 
the number of pregnant women who go into a coma each year is 
small doctors say and many questions remain about how a pregnant 
womans coma affects the fetus and how a fetus affects the recovery 
of its comatose mother 
thats why simon alan blodgetts birth was so unique and why 
martin klein fought for an abortion hoping to improve his wifes 
chances of recovery 
there are no accurate statistics but three large us trauma 
centers report a total of about 20 cases of pregnant women in comas 
over two years doctors at all three hospitals agreed that in most 
cases the coma ends and the woman goes home and has a healthy baby 
with severe head injuries most fetuses abort naturally are aborted 
to help the mother or die in childbirth 
there is a very high incidence of spontaneous abortion that 
occurs in these cases said dr robert white of case western 
reserve university and director of neurosurgery at metropolitan 
general hospital in cleveland one of the largest trauma centers 
out of this group they either spontaneously abort or after a few 
weeks they go home to deliver 
in perhaps one comatose patient a year is a birth even attempted 
and white said he could not remember such a birth ever being 
successful at the hospital the mother often begins to unravel 
medically forcing doctors to try for a premature birth he said 
there is not a lot of research in this 
doctors at university hospital in seattle said simon blodgets 
birth was only the fourth successful delivery from a comatose mother 
they could document in medical history 
dr madhura patel of baylor college of medicine in houston who 
specializes in treating head injuries to pregnant women has seen 
only seven such cases in two years several patients recovered with 
fetuses intact but in one case of an unmarried teenager who was 
five weeks pregnant the girls father ordered an abortion his 
daughter was unlikely ever to be able to care for an infant 
the mother subsequently woke up from the coma but continues to 
be impaired she has no memory of the fact of ever being pregnant 
blodgett 24 of yakima suffered brain stem injury in a traffic 
accident june 30 when she was three months pregnant after initial 
reluctance family members say a seattle hospital accepted her 
doctors held out little hope of improvement but shortly after 
simons dec 9 birth blodgett began regaining consciousness and was 
well enough to return home in midjanuary 
she has made steady progress and has limited use of one arm 
allowing her to cradle her newborn and point to letters to spell 
words last week she began intensive rehabilitation at st 
elizabeths medical center in yakima and in a unique challenge 
has vowed to walk and talk before her newborn 
no one knows exactly why blodgett came around after the birth 
although one doctor speculated that hormonal changes triggered a 
return to consciousness 
family members feel she was conserving her energy for the fetus 
after she had the baby it was a signal for her to go husband 
david blodgett jr said after she had the baby she concentrated 
more on herself 
the family never had a lot of hope from any doctor blodgett 
said but always had faith she would recover we spent so much 
time with her that you could see the small things she did 
martin klein had no such hopes he successfully battled 
antiabortion activists to win a court order allowing the abortion 
which doctors said could aid his wifes recovery mrs klein 32 
remains in a coma at north shore university hospital on new yorks 
long island

when most people think of blimps 
they imagine gently floating giant balloons advertising everything 
from tires to film to soft drinks 
the department of defense has another picture protector of 
warships able to remain nearly invisible to radar while providing 
early warning of approaching enemy aircraft 
blimps played this role in world war ii but the navy abandoned 
its airships as outdated in the early 1960s 
now the pentagon has ordered construction of a 425footlong 
blimp that will be the largest nonrigid airship ever built more 
than twice as long as a conventional blimp the blimp will be 
equipped with powerful radar and will be capable of patrolling for 
several days without refueling it will fly as high as 10000 feet 
at speeds up to 80 knots about 92 miles per hour 
everyone has been doing these paper studies of the airships 
for i dont know ever since they stopped using airships said 
ron hochstetler of airship industries a british blimp maker that is 
building the military blimp in a joint venture with westinghouse 
electric corp 
the only way anyone will really be able to say whether or not a 
wide moderntechnology airship would have benefits in the modern 
navy is to actually have one that size that you go up and fly on and 
try out your ideas with 
so many of the ideas are predicated on installing equipment 
that never existed before in the old airship days hochstetler 
said weve all kind of new technologies that conceivably can make 
them much more usable 
airship industries sees a new generation of blimps being used not 
just for military surveillance but for spotting drugsmuggling 
planes monitoring ocean pollution and taking tourists on 
sightseeing flights 
surveillance is certainly one that they are pushing very hard 
its a machine thats very good at that job its good at 
advertising its very good at people going for a ride to see the 
scenery said capt billy e richardson manager of airships 
facility here 
to get from a to b no its not the machine for it 
airship industries the worlds largest manufacturer of blimps 
has built 13 since it was formed about eight years ago said mary 
lee dickson assistant marketing manager in new york among them are 
two blimps sold to south korea and tokyo for police surveillance 
the 168 million prototype of the military blimp should be ready 
to fly by 1993 hochstetler said 
a model of its threedeck gondola is under construction in a 
former navy blimp hangar built during world war ii outside elizabeth 
city the compartment underneath the blimp will contain sleeping 
berths for a crew of 12 to 15 an exercise room refueling gear and 
other equipment 
the blimp will be able to move up or down forward or backward 
with the help of computerized flight controls and vectoredthrust 
engines equipped with propellers that can be swiveled to any up or 
down angle 
the blimps plasticlined fabric hull will be filled with helium 
which is nonflammable the rigid dirigibles of the 1930s like the 
illfated hindenburg were filled with explosive hydrogen 
if the blimp is fired upon it would remain afloat because it has 
low internal pressure and the gas would escape slowly even with a 
severe helium loss the blimp would slowly descend rather than 
crash airship said 
airship officials believe blimps potential has barely been 
explored and say that the prototype should lead to other military 
and commercial uses 
the airship can do things no other aircraft can hochstetler 
said weve just scratched the surface

leprosy treatment has come a long way since

would black strawberries on your shortcake whet your appetite 
how about some blue sweet corn and would peter piper pick a peck of 
purple peppers 
these colored vegetables and others are available or in the 
process of being developed would they lure you to the market at 
least to try some 
the black beauty strawberry known thus far as ny1593 is 
an advanced selection of strawberry characterized by a deep 
purplishred color that is almost black 
i hesitate to recommend it as a table variety because i dont 
think people are ready to accept strawberries that arent red 
says john c sanford of cornell universitys new york state 
agricultural experiment station in geneva ny who is working on 
the berry he believes the berry may be valuable as a natural 
coloring agent for processed foods ice cream yogurt and frozen 
fruit bars 
the black berry is large attractive relatively firm and has a 
pleasant flavor says sanford who ranked it about the same in 
nutritional value as the traditional red berry 
blue corn wont turn your teeth blue as some folks might fear 
says rose edwards of albuquerque nm who founded blue corn 
connection in 1985 he produces blue corn popcorn pancake muffin 
and waffle mixes blue corn cnips and blue corn meal ground coarse 
medium and fine 
edwards says people are intrigued by a blue product and most of 
our products come across a little sweeter he says about 15000 
acres of blue corn are being farmed presently largely in the 
southwest 
there are quite a few purple vegetables purple cabbages 
alternated with green ones in the garden are attractive there are 
glossy purple eggplants named black magic 
purple cauliflower actually looks more like broccoli but with 
smaller buds varieties include purplehead and royal purple purple 
cauliflowers generally become green when cooked 
seed companies also are offering blue potatoes white eggplant 
yellow beets and burgundy beans 
scalloped or pattypan squash normally seen in white or pale 
green is now available in a dark green variety called 
scallopini 
one potato variety named all blue has both blue skin and 
blue flesh while blue victor has blue skin and white flesh 
blue spud plants generally produce less than more traditional 
varieties and size is likely to be smaller 
white eggplant may be smaller than the regular purple varietles 
and as they mature they may turn yellow the flavor also may be 
stronger 
and there are golden beets that can be used for the same dishes 
as red beets without bleeding their color into surrounding 
vegetables 
some traditionally green and yellow vegetables have gone to red 
and yellow including green beans with purple pods named royal 
burgundy a purple cauliflower named royal purple and an okra 
with deep red pods simply called red okra the color changes to 
dark green upon cooking 
red cabbages and red lettuce add color to your garden among them 
are ruby ball and red acre cabbage and red salad bowl 
and ruby lettuce 
ray rothenberger horticulture specialist at the university of 
missouri cooperative extension service has said that gardeners 
often want flowers fruits and vegetables in colors other than those 
natural to the plant in nature as well as by the manipulation of 
breeders unusual colors sometimes appear although relatively 
rarely some of them can be reproduced and made available for garden 
use while others are shortlived and may never be seen again 
for the vegetable garden he said you may find white 
pumpkins green cantaloupes red brussels sprouts striped beets 
blue potatoes yellow radishes white acorn squash and even yellow 
strawberries 
rothenberger said a red brussels sprout has been introduced from 
europe named rubine it maintains its red coloring during cooking 
acorn squash also may be found in yellow as well as dark green 
for the gardener as well as on the plate rothenberger said 
unusual colors add interest novelty and perhaps new tastes 
cornell researchers also reported that the traditional white 
heads of cauliflower may be challenged by an orangecolored cousin 
a head that looks and tastes like the white variety one that 
seemingly has a cheese sauce bred into it has a longer shelflife 
and is very nutritious 
a big question marketers will face is the saleability of the 
unusally colored cauliflower so a curious richard m dickson of 
cornell took 100 heads of orange cauliflower to a popular geneva 
nyarea farm market 
i think this is a winner said joseph nicholson who operates 
red jacket orchards i believe there is a ready acceptance for 
this color because it is novel and because it looks as if its been 
drenched with cheese sauce 
he said the test supply sold readily as did a second 100 
provided by dickson 
dickson said the orange cauliflower identified only by number 
now promises to be something more than just a number once a 
nutritionminded public discovers its benefits

who says the only good bug is a dead bug one of the best bugs to 
have in your garden is the ladybug each day it feeds on many 
bad insects such as aphids colorado potato beetles grape 
rootworms alfalfa weevils plus others this helps keep things in 
natural balance 
the blackspotted red ladybird better known as ladybug is a 
voracious predatory beetle described as one the most beneficial on 
earth 
millions of them have been released on croplands their hearty 
appetites helping to reduce aphid populations with biological pest 
control 
cornell university scientists note the advantages of biological 
controls there is no environmental damage the pests do not develop 
resistance to their predators as they do to chemicals and a small 
initial investment results in a safe permanent control method 
in palo alto calif some years ago park officials released 
300000 ladybugs to fight plant pests gardeners in albuquerque 
nm scattered more than 25 mlllion ladybugs to protect plants in 
medford ore jackson and perkins invited thousands of ladybugs to 
an aphid feast in their rose test garden 
national geographic magazine has reported 4300 known species of 
ladybugs or which north america has 370 remember tne childrens 
chant ladybug ladybug fly away home your house is on fire 
your children will burn this was a plea by english farmers 
concerned for the safety of ladybugs during the annual burning of 
hop fields 
given a chance an adult egglaying ladybug may consume up to 200 
aphids a day one larva may eat between 200 and 300 during its 
development 
national geographic noted that ladybugs were put to work by man 
in the late 1800s when a species rodolia cardinalis was imported 
into california from australia to combat the cottony cushion scale 
insect saving the citrus industry in two years at a cost of only 
1500 
ladybugs are sold by the pint quart and gallon a halfpint 
means about 4000 ladybugs 
a major concern is in getting the tiny migratory insects not to 
fly away home california studies indicate that 90 percent wing off 
after release since they dont fly at night a late afternoon or 
early evening release will encourage at least an overnight stay 
the beetles are very mobile when there only a few aphids around 
a cornell researcher reported they migrate searching for other 
areas of food scouting apple crops oats winter wheat sugar beets 
and beans the researchers imported the predacious european 
sevenspotted lady beetle to help protect potato and alfalfa fields 
there is no correlation between the number of spots and the 
beetles age the number of spots on a beetles back is 
characteristic of its species not its age 
ladybugs are but one example of millions of harmless insects 
cornell noted in fact fewer than 2 percent of all insects are 
pests and those are often controlled by natural enemies the 
researchers recommend that gardeners and homeowners be certain that 
insects are actually doing damage before they take action 
insects belong in a garden they are natural and often harmless 
if not beneficial spray only if you detect damage beneficial 
insects such as ladybugs ot all kinds and green lacewings should be 
protected entomologists say by learning to identify their eggs and 
larvae we may save time money energy and the environment 
many ladybugs have been released in recent years to devour aphids 
feeding on upstate new york alfalfa peaches and potatoes 
if you see an unattractive dark insect with orange blue and 
black patches and a deeply segmented body covered with spines dont 
squash it it may be an immatore lady beetle hungry and looking for 
a meal 
one catalog burpee offers a halfpint for 995 a quart for 
1795 recommending they be released in small batches

if summer brings a lull to your gardening activity perhaps 
youll have time to build a rock garden 
select a location that has at least a halfday of sun more is 
better if you want to make a show of flowering plants 
a steep slope or the vicinity of a rock outcrop is good not 
everyone has such a location however and we suggest you avoid 
making a round pile in the middle of a lawn instead place the rock 
garden in a corner off to the side next to a foundation or 
bordering steps 
if the area is level change the grade shovel out the soil a 
foot to 18 inches and slope it perhaps making two hills with a 
valley between then put in a 6inch layer of stones or gravel for 
drainage on this foundation replace the soil mixing in sand or 
gravel to improve drainage add some peat 
then develop the contour with the lowest or largest stones 
embedded to make them look as though they have always been there 
then add your next layer with the spaces between filled with the 
mixture or medium for the plants to grow in 
we suggest you place rocks horizontally and in a line so that 
they appear to be part of a bed or layer avoid dragons teeth 
or pointed sharp rocks standing up we prefer one kind of stone not 
a collection and micainfested rocks are quite gaudy 
continue building to a reasonable height then place a few stones 
to tie in the main groupings in the garden you can move them around 
until you get the right effect then imbed the rocks into the soil 
finally place your plants a narrow hand trowel is handy to dig 
between the rocks 
select low creeping plants not border flowers consider 
alyssum aubrietas low pinks armerias creeping phlox miniature 
iris or other miniatures spring and fall crocus snowdrops and 
other lowgrowing varieties 
you dont have to feed often water when necessary and weed or 
loosen soil if necessary

the primary use of houseplant containers is to hold the soil for 
plants to grow in but they have a major influence on plant growth 
because they affect a plants water supply 
the size and porosity of plant containers and the presence or 
absence of drainage holes in the bottom are critical factors says 
lee taylor michigan state university extension horticulture 
specialist the relative sizes of the pot and the plant it holds 
affect both the plants water and nutrient supplies 
taylor says that a plant thats too large for its pot dries out 
quickly a plant in an oversized pot may suffer from too much water 
because after watering the soil stays saturated for a long time 
also the nutrients in the soil may be leached out before the plant 
has a chance to use them 
the containers porosity affects the plants water supply by 
influencing how quickly the soil dries out after watering 
householders who tend to overwater plants should avoid glazed glass 
or plastic containers because they keep water from moving out of the 
soil and air from moving in on the other hand porous clay pots 
permit air to move into the soil and water to escape this is 
important because plant roots need air as well as water to function 
roots that stay a long time in waterlogged soil tend to rot and 
die 
excess water escapes through drainage holes 
taylor says it is important to discard excess water after the 
soil is thoroughly moistened so that the soil can dry if the pot 
sits in water after the soll is thoroughly moistened the soil wlll 
absorb water as fast as its lost to evaporation or taken up by 
plant roots as a result the spaces between soil particles will 
remain filled with water rather than air using clay pots with 
drainage holes and saucers is no guarantee that you wont overwater 
plants clay might be a good choice however if you tend to kill 
your plants with too much attention says taylor if you want the 
decorative look of glazed ceramic pots simply place the porous clay 
pot inside the fancy container

the most critical time for young plants transplanted to your 
garden is the first week dont plant such tender crops as tomatoes 
peppers petunias impatiens and begonias until all danger of frost 
has ended planting too early is perhaps the major cause of loss of 
bedding plants 
some animal and insect problems can be averted with pesticides 
and other products available in garden shops buy good quality 
transplant seedlings as well as seeds 
short compact bushy plants with some side shoots already formed 
are better than tall thin straggly items that have had to stretch 
to reach light or are spindly due to overcrowded roots 
in buying such popular bedding plants as tomatoes marigolds 
salvias and petunias choose healthy dark green color avoid plants 
with yellow wilted or shrivelled leaves 
if you buy seedlings in peat pots gently remove the bottom of 
the pot and release the roots while roots will penetrate the peat 
which eventually will decompose a dry period could keep roots 
potbound and hinder good development be careful not to tear the 
plant roots 
water all plants thoroughly immediately after transplanting

many food crops including strawberries cherries blueberries 
and sweet corn suffer bird damage one way to protect them is to 
float a special scareeye balloon reported successful in 
scaring birds ln japan 
other ways are to use firecrackers sonic devices carbide and 
propane cannons rubber snakes owl decoys and netting but birds 
get used to these and their effectiveness diminishes

what do you do with the clippings after moving the lawn 
put them back into the earth with a mulching mower say spokesmen 
at the bolens corp 
mulching results in generally greener and healthier lawns because 
the nutrients are returned to the soil they say mulch particles 
decompose and are absorbed by the grass root system within 14 days

root rot and crown rot army worms and cutworms blister beetles 
and japanese beetles lace bugs mealy bugs and spittle bugs this 
is just a sampling of the ills that plants are heir to 
some can be prevented some treated by natural or chemical means 
many experts say that a healthy plant is less likely to succumb 
to illness or damage while others say this may be more coincidence 
than direct cause and effect but its generally agreed that the 
conditions that make the plant healthy are also likely to help curb 
the spread of pests and disease 
joel flagler rutgers university agriculturalresources 
management agent for bergen county nj says that for a plant to 
be healthy it must be suited to the conditions under which it will 
grow soil moisture and light must all be appropriate he and 
others suggest having soil tested it can be done through the us 
department of agricultures cooperative extension services 
throughout the country and there are kits for testing soil oneself 
some pests can be avoided or controlled through companion 
planting planting one plant as a decoy or pest repellent near 
another that one is cultivating thalassa cruso in making 
vegtetables grow suggests nasturtiums to lure aphids from 
cucumbers marigolds to control root nematodes microscopically 
small worms and plenty of garlic as an overall repellent she also 
relays suggestions that dill will keep away tomato worms mint 
provides insurance against ants and radishes protect cucumbers 
squash and melons 
rotating crops is another way to keep pests or disease from 
getting established and gardeners can buy certified seed and plants 
bred to be diseaseresistant also isolate for a while any new 
plant you acquire through gift or purchase so you can determine 
whether it is healthy 
and dont forget the bugs that eat other bugs and the birds with 
their appetite for insects 
a home gardener who has read up on the subject or had a bit of 
experience may be able to diagnose some plant problems highly 
visible white flies the fine webs that spider mites leave on the 
underside of leaves japanese beetles if a plant is cut off at the 
soil line you may find a cutworm a type of grub in the 
surrounding soil remove and squash it 
removeandsquash is not a particularly attractive idea but its 
also useful against tomato worms slugs japanese beetles and the 
japanese beetle grub which resembles a cutworm 
other plant ailments are harder to diagnose and the gardener may 
wish to follow the suggestion of 1000 garden questions vol 
ii edited by marjorie dietz and send a sample to the nearest 
agricultural experiment station for analysis 
in the case of some pests a strong blast of water from a hose 
may drive them away a spraying with insecticidal soap is another 
possible solution 
then there are the pesticides 
some rotenone and pyrethrum for instance have organic 
sources they come from plants others are chemical compounds 
garden experts urge one to use any pesticide exactly as directed 
they warn too that what harms the pest may also hurt other 
insect or animal life for instance elvin macdonald director of 
special projects at the brooklyn ny botanic garden says that 
systemic pesticides working through the soil may hurt friendly 
bacteria as well as harmful ones 
for anyone inclined to blame geography for his gardening 
troubles dara emery a plant breeder at the santa barbara calif 
botanic garden offers consolation of a sort most plant problems 
can occur anywhere true he says california roses have less black 
spot and rust but mildew and spotted mites still cause problems 
and people in other parts of the country dont have the problem of 
salts that get into the soil in california through needed irrigation 
finally the gardener pestered by pests can always resort to an 
oldfashioned solution mentioned by macdonald grow enough for 
everyone including the insects

is there such a thing as painless gardening 
judy glatstein an instructor in design at the new york botanical 
garden and herself a gardener in wilton conn says perhaps not 
but there are many things one can do to minimize the aches 
use tools appropriate to the job she urges if youre planting 
just a few bulbs a trowel will do for large quantities dig up the 
area involved with a shovel or spade dont use a heavy pump sprayer 
if you have only a few bushes or plants to spray a small container 
with a hand trigger will do 
reading seed catalogs in winter is fun but it wont keep you in 
shape for gardening in the spring mrs glatstein fred mcgourty a 
norwalk conn nurseryman who teaches at the new york botanical 
garden and others urge exercise walking swimming other sports 
during the winter and in the spring start gardening slowly dont 
try to put in a full day right off 
lifting is less likely to give gardeners aching backs if they 
bend the knees grasp the item to be lifted and then straighten up 
mrs glatstein also says heavy things should be carried if they 
must be carried close to the body but she adds man invented 
the wheel for a reason so get a wheelbarrow or garden cart for 
heavy moving the bigger the wheels the more maneuverable the cart 
knees ache from damp earth pads for kneeling can be purchased at 
garden centers or elsewhere or made at home using scrap foam 
rubber or try raised beds or a hanging garden in pots 
joel flagler a rutgers university agriculturalresources 
management agent in new jersey says garden centers and garden 
supply catalogs offer all kinds of adaptive tools that make it 
possible for elderly or handicapped people to garden and for anyone 
to garden more comfortably wood or aluminum handles can extend the 
length of standard shovels hoes or cultivators low folding chairs 
and stools enable one to sit while weeding or hoeing 
attitude toward gardening may also contribute to pain or 
painlessness some gardeners say 
to keep up your morale take on chores you can complete urges 
mrs glatstein then go on to something else she says beginning 
gardeners should keep their gardens small and choose plants that are 
easy to maintain 
elvin macdonald director of special projects at brooklyn botanic 
garden in new york also urges gardeners to relax if you think 
weeding hard dirt a curse then youre more likely to get 
blisters he says 
tools should feel comfortable to the user and should be used 
properly short or tall strong or not so strong the gardener 
buying a tool should look around until finding one that feels right 
the cooperative extension service at cornell university in new 
york state offers these tips 
dont leave a rake on the ground with the tines pointed upward 
if you step on it the handle may hit you in the face and the tines 
could hurt your foot 
wear gloves when picking up garden debris in case there are 
thorns or other sharp items 
wear protective goggles when using power equipment and a mask 
over mouth and nose when spraying with insecticide

christian dior anna pavlova and the empress 
josephine found immortality in the rose garden but the honor 
requires luck and lots of money 
for centuries rose breeders have named new varieties in honor of 
the heroic the beautiful and the famous but they wont guarantee 
the flower will catch the publics fancy 
it costs up to 62000 to buy the right to name a rose says 
terry kenwright vice president of the british association of rose 
breeders 
he said it can take as long as 15 years to develop a new blossom 
and breeders are businessmen they want some reward for their 
effort 
britains 17 professional breeders introduce only 35 new 
varieties each year on average and only a fraction of those are 
available for private naming 
newspapers charities and big businesses have roses named after 
them theres a chrysler imperial rose and a times rose the everest 
double fragrance is named after a storm window factory 
one of the oldest and most famous cultivated roses is the fragile 
pink flower the french call cuisse de nymphe nymphs thigh the 
british who have grown it for 500 years prefer to call it great 
maidens blush 
a blossom named after a factory might smell as sweet but could 
it so perfectly evoke the silken cheek of youth 
in the depths of winter a rose catalog with its mysterious and 
seductive names offers a promise of spring there is eglantine 
celestial rose damour black prince and the splendid crimson 
cardinal de richelieu 
even rosa horrida described in one catalog as a strange 
gooseberrylike bush from the 18th century appeals to the 
curiosity 
there are dashing dukes grandpa dickson and the dress designer 
dior but the honors go mostly to the ladies penelope ballet 
dancer anna pavlova dozens of duchesses and ma perkins 
roses have inspired wonderful tales about their origin a jealous 
goddess created the flower to rival venus beauty the first rose 
sprang from the sweat of the prophet mohammed or fell from the hair 
of aurora as she combed her golden locks 
one of historys greatest rose lovers napoleons empress 
josephine grew every known rose of the day at malmaison chateau and 
is honored by the pale pink souvenir de la malmaison 
the unfortunate atom bomb reputedly quite a nice red rose never 
caught on and disappeared from the catalogs soon after its 
introduction in 1954 
some say the peace rose by any other name might not have become 
one of the most popular modern varieties bred in southern france 
during world war ii and shipped out of the country just before 
hitlers armies invaded it was named in the united states on the 
day berlin fell to the allies 
hundreds of peace blooms were sent to the first united nations 
conference in 1945 it was planted in gardens and at memorials and 
by the mid1950s an estimated 30 million of the bushes had been 
sold 
few dare to speak ill of this famous yellow rose tinged with 
pink but some mutter under their breath that it has no fragrance 
and can a rose be a rose be a rose without perfume

arugula cardoon gobo scorzonera 
no theyre not rare diseases nor are they foreign phrases that 
will get your face slapped 
they are among dozens of new and unusual gourmet vegetables 
some call them designer vegetables on a list compiled for home 
gardeners and commercial growers by a cornell university vegetable 
crop specialist 
unconventional crops have become increasingly popular in recent 
years says robert a kline a senior extension associate for 
cornell cooperative extension in the college of life and sciences at 
the ithaca ny school kline attributes the interest to the 
increase in healthconscious consumers who eat more conventional 
vegetables and are looking for diversity 
the market for these unconventional vegetables will continue to 
expand he says and vegetable growers in the northeast should 
have a share of that growing market 
similar conclusions have been reached by richard vanvranken an 
agricultural agent in atlantic county nj for the rutgers 
cooperative extension service 
at a recent convention of the new jersey annual vegetable 
meeting vanvranken said that baby carrots endive radicchio 
oriental radishes fennel and mung beans are some of the vegetable 
varieties that restaurant chefs love to experiment with and home 
cooks are not afraid to try 
robert l bidner president of rlb food distributors of west 
caldwell nj said a few years ago if i tried to introduce the 
avocado to a grocer he would have laughed me out the door not 
anymore theres a national preoccupation with health and fitness 
and waves of new immigrants and sophisticated consumers who read 
food magazines 
thats one of the reasons that cornells kline developed his list 
of more than 240 varieties of some 50 crops based on field trials 
conducted over the past three years 
his recommended crops range from jerusalem artichoke to a rare 
tomato called tomatillo that yields golfballsized fruit inside 
papery sheathes or capsules it is used to make salsa a spicy 
sauce 
arugula thats a spicy leafy vegetable used in salads gobo is 
a root crop popular in japan cardoon is a leafy vegetable with a 
wide vein in the middle only the vein is eaten and scorzonera 
is a type of salsify known as vegetable oyster or oyster 
plant because its blackskinned roots taste somewhat like oysters 
other exotic crops recommended include radicchio a type of 
chicory that forms a head much like lettuce witloof a belgian 
endive chinese artichoke which produces very small potatolike 
tubers and escarole a kind of endive with flatter leaves

remember the day of the triffids the sciencefiction 
thriller in which a hail of seeds blossom into fastgrowing plants 
or the musical little shop of horrors in which a talking 
moving plant takes over control 
these it seemed were the stuff movies and fantasies were made 
of 
but a university of miami biophysicist says there actually are 
plants that move 
most plants dont move says thomas j herbert one of a 
handful of scientists interested in how plants move and why they 
bother but a surprising number do although they dont go walking 
around the ground like triffids which are technically 
threeparted leaves 
twelve or 14 plant families have members that can move their 
leaves relatively rapidly says the biophysicist at the coral 
gables fla school the leaves of one sensitive plant he 
says fold up and seem to draw away when touched 
theyre an extreme example because they move so rapidly he 
says 
many legumes members of the pea family are capable of 
conspicuous motion others more commonly react to sunlight and 
water 
herbert says that he hopes by studying plants that are capable of 
movement more can be learned about what conditions are important 
for all plants 
i use them like a little computer says herbert they can 
readjust the position of their leaves for various conditions of sun 
heat water and so forth so observing them is like telling the 
plant find me the leaf angle you like best in these conditions 
and the plant responds and that response we assume is telling us 
whats best for it 
in this way we can begin to understand the needs of other 
plants that cant move 
he says that understanding the needs of plants may lead to the 
adjustment of conditions for plants to the benefit of people

avid gardeners are careful to protect their ferns from bright 
sunlight their roses from harmful aphids and their lawns from 
drought but unfortunately they often dont take the same care to 
protect their eyes 
according to the american optometric association nearly 3400 
americans suffer eye injuries from lawn mowers and home gardening 
equipment every year and most of the injuries could be prevented 
with safety eyewear 
regular prescription glasses or contact lenses are not enough 
the association says although eyeglasses are by federal regulation 
impactresistant they are not safety glasses and are no match for 
rocks tossed up by power mowers 
also notes the industry trade group spray or dust from weed 
killers and fertilizers can get around regular glasses and into the 
eyes 
since contact lenses offer little protection the optometrists 
add nonprescription safely eyewear should be worn over them they 
also suggest that inexpensive plastic safety goggles sold at 
hardware and department stores or types that fit over prescription 
eyewear will meet most home gardeners eye safety needs 
however the association advises buyers to make sure the goggles 
meet american national standards institute standards by looking for 
the manufacturers monogram on the lenses 
like many plants gardeners eyes should be protected from the 
suns harmful rays quality sunglases can do the job and provide 
comfort by reducing glare the optometrists say recommending a 
medium or dark gray tint because it does not distort colors 
sunglasses they add should screen out 75 to 90 percent of the 
sunlight 
gardeners need good vision to read the instructions on seed 
packages fertilizer bags and weed killer cans to detect weeds and 
to spot fungi or insects on plants

one plant not valued by gardeners is poison ivy 
rashes resulting from poison ivy encounters most often occur in 
summer when it thrives and victims are lightly dressed 
the best thing of course is to recognize and avoid the plant 
but if you make contact act quickly and thoroughly to minimize the 
discomfort 
here are some pointers recommended by the 3m first aid center 
remember that the poison is in the sap found on leaves or 
roots not the leaves themselves 
choose clothing that offers the best coverage if youre going 
to be gardening in an area where there might be poison ivy long 
pants socks long sleeves and gloves are advised 
clothes that have come into contact with the sap can spread the 
infection so remove them carefully and wash them immediately treat 
garden equipment particularly handles the same way 
if your skin comes into contact with the sap wash the area 
right away washing with soap and water two or three times may even 
prevent your getting a rash though that ultimately depends on your 
own sensitivity to the toxins in the sap 
itching and rash probably will appear from 24 to 48 hours after 
contact keep the area clean and dry if blisters develop clean and 
dress the affected area especially if the skin is broken since a 
secondary infection may set in if the rash is widespread or keeps 
you from getting on with your daily activities contact your doctor 
prescription steroids taken orally may bring relief in serious 
cases but dont rely on overthecounter steroid creams because 
they wont help 
if the rash is localized the best thing is to let the 
condition run its course usually two or three weeks

a healthy green lawn may still be possible this season even if it 
suffered damage in last summers heat and drought 
if more than half of the lawn is in good shape it can be rescued 
by renovation and overseeding according to bob tracinski consumer 
information manager for john deere manufacturers of lawn and garden 
equipment 
renovation includes cleaning the lawn of weeds thatch and 
debris overseeding is planting new seed over the entire area not 
only will renovation take care of the trouble spots its a 
beneficial treatment for the existing lawn tracinski says 
he suggests starting the rehabilitation by testing the soil so 
that its lime and fertilizer needs can be determined the testing 
can be done by most county extension offices for a small charge 
prepare the samples by cutting thin slices six or seven inches below 
the lawns surface including soil from several areas of the lawn 
put them into clean containers labeled with information about the 
location of the soil and what you intend to plant there 
next remove unwanted weeds and grasses using a herbicide that 
will not leave a residue that might harm healthy grass or new 
seedlings expect to wait several weeks before attempting to plant 
new seed 
thatch a layer of leaves dead grass and other debris 
accumulates between the grass blades and the soil surface it can 
build up thickly enough to prevent water and nutrients from getting 
to the soil and it can harbor pests and disease the easiest way to 
deal with it is by using a thatching machine or thatching 
attachments for riding mowers and lawn tractors which can be 
rented these function as mechanical rakes cutting into the lawn 
vertically and slicing the debris with sharp blades or tines 
then the soil should be loosened up and aerated to allow air 
water and nutrients to pass through to the roots of the grass 
aerating can be done manually by punching holes in the soil with a 
large spike or by a machine that can be rented its easiest to work 
on a damp lawn 
if the soil test points to lime or fertilizer add them next for 
most lawns a fertilizer ratio of three parts nitrogen one part 
phosphorus and two parts potassium works best use no more than one 
pound of nitrogen per 1000 square feet of lawn 
the ground is now ready for new seed which should be spread 
evenly over the area raking it in lightly with the bare soil seeds 
should be covered with no more than onequarter inch of soil 
finish and maintain the lawn with regular sprinkling fertilizing 
and mowing in hot dry weather water several times a day

a method of increasing vegetable yields using 
available resources developed by a cornell university graduate is 
bringing better nutrition to people in underdeveloped third world 
nations 
called biointensive gardening the technique depends on 
local conditions and uses available plant and animal wastes rather 
than expensive imported fertilizers coupled with basic knowledge 
about crop rotation and companion planting best for small plots the 
method has increased vegetable crop yields wherever it has been 
tried 
julian gonsalves senior researcher at the international 
institute for rural reconstruction in the philippines developed 
biointensive gardening while a graduate student at cornell his 
demonstration project in the philippines started with three rural 
villages and grew to 224 villages by the second growing season 
in each village several local farmers were trained in the 
technique including seed bed preparation use of organic 
fertilizers composting and natural pest control the farmers 
applied the techniques to small family vegetable plots usually 
about 200 square feet they followed up with discussions with 
institute technicians about problems encountered such as soil 
erosion after heavy rain technicians then could devise techniques 
to deal with the problem using available resources 
biointensive farming has been used successfully in both 
highrainfall and arid climates

your houseplant ferns turn brown and dry whats the problem 
ferns often are challenging to grow in the house because they 
usually prefer cool temperatures a maximum of about 72 degrees in 
the daytime indirect light moist soil and humid air 
browning and drying of frond tips and yellowing and drooping of 
interior leaves usually mean that the air is too dry place ferns in 
an area of the house that is naturally more humid such as the 
kitchen bathroom or laundry room or place plants in trays of wet 
gravel and use a room humidifier to add moisture to the air the 
humidifier may help your comfort too

if houseplants on windowsills develop black blotches on leaves 
and some become droopy it could be cold injury many of these 
plants originated in the tropics and can easily be damaged easily by 
low or freezing temperatures 
leaves that touch cold window glass in winter may freeze and turn 
black especially if closed drapes or blinds deprive the plant of 
heated air in the room 
a remedy is to increase light levels for plants by grouping them 
under fluorescent lamps rather than crowding them against cold 
windows

economic growth will slow significantly this 
year while inflation and interest rates both rise but the country 
should be able to avoid a recession the nations top business 
economists predicted today 
the national association of business economists says a survey of 
its members found them slightly more optimistic about the economys 
fortunes in 1989 than they were just three months ago 
however three out of four of the economists still believe 
president bush will have to deal with an economic downturn in the 
first two years of his presidency 
that represented a decline from the 89 percent who last november 
expected a recession by the end of 1990 and the number predicting a 
recession this year showed an even bigger drop from 40 percent 
three months ago to 19 percent now 
but the belief that the current expansion which has already 
lasted a peacetime record of six years will keep steaming ahead for 
two more years is still a minority view held by just onefourth of 
the economists surveyed 
the median forecast for growth this year as measured by the 
gross national product was 27 percent up slightly from a 25 
percent estimate made three months ago 
that is still onehalf percentage point lower than the bush 
administrations estimate that the gnp will expand at the robust 
clip of 32 percent in 1989 
the administration is counting on faster growth to bring in more 
revenues and help it lower the budget deficit without the need to 
resort to higher taxes 
on the question of interest rates another critical component of 
the budget deficit because of the cost of financing the 27 
trillion national debt the business economists see shortterm rates 
hitting a peak of 85 percent this year and then beginning to 
decline to 78 percent by the end of 1989 
the administration is forecasting substantially lower rates for 
this year 
the survey was taken before the federal reserve boosted the 
discount rate on friday to a threeyear high of 7 percent an 
increase in the discount rate the interest the central bank charges 
to make loans to commercial banks is the most dramatic gesture the 
fed can make to show its determination to push the cost of credit 
higher and dampen inflationary pressures 
the business economists expressed strong support for the feds 
inflationfighting battle with 70 percent expecting the board to 
boost interest rates further in the next six months 
while expressing an urgent need for congress and the 
administration to reach an agreement on a credible deficit reduction 
plan the business economists generally supported bushs stand 
against new taxes only about 15 percent of those surveyed said they 
believed tax increases should be emphasized over cutting government 
spending 
among the government programs which should face the knife a 
large majority of the economists 72 percent favored slashing farm 
subsidies cuts in military spending were favored by 55 percent 
while 47 percent believed social security costofliving increases 
should be pared to reduce the budget deficit 
among those who advocated raising taxes to help get the deficit 
under control the overwhelming favorite place to look was an 
increase in the gasoline tax preferred by 71 percent followed by 
51 percent who said user fees for government services should be 
increased 
on other topics the business economists said 
inflation will worsen this year with consumer prices climbing by 
48 percent compared to an increase of 44 percent in both 1987 and 
1988 
the merchandise trade deficit which dropped by 20 percent to 
137 billion last year will continue improving but at a slower rate 
in 1989 falling by 12 percent to 120 billion 
unemployment will show little change averaging 55 percent for 
the year the same as in 1988 this estimate was based on a belief 
that the economy will be expanding enough to take care of new 
entrants into the labor force but not fast enough to make further 
inroads in the jobless rate 
personal consumption spending which accounts for twothirds of 
overall economic activity will grow by 25 percent this year 
little changed from last year with new housing starts and new auto 
sales remaining close to last years levels 
the survey on economic projections was based on responses from 69 
economists who make up the associations economic forecasting panel 
while the assessments of budgetary and monetary policy came from a 
broader survey of nearly 300 of the associations members

another air disaster involving a boeing co plane 
has officials of the seattlebased manufacturer shaking their heads 
over what appears to be a lengthy bout with bad luck 
on friday a huge hole ripped open in the fuselage of a united 
airlines boeing 747 shortly after it took off from hawaii and nine 
people died when they were sucked from the aircraft the pilot was 
able to land the crippled plane at honolulu 
federal investigators believe failed cargo door locks may be 
responsible but national transportation safety board officials have 
not come to any conclusions 
although boeings business is booming its not been a good year 
for the aerospace giant which has seen a number of mishaps and 
accidents involving its jets 
it also is dealing with an embarrassing delay in shipping its 
newest airplane the longrange 747400 and reports of miswiring in 
some newer boeing models 
what you have here is a series of events and the only 
correlation is that theyre happening in the same time frame but if 
you dissect each one you will find that theyre totally unrelated 
said david jimenez of boeing commercial airplanes 
with news reports of problems in rapid succession however it 
does become one large blur to the public jimenez said 
the planes carry the boeing name and it reflects on the boeing 
image any time theres an accident no matter what the cause said 
boeing spokesman john wheeler were concerned about what happens 
to every airplane throughout its life 
fridays tragedy was chillingly reminiscent of an april 28 1988 
accident in which a flight attendant was killed and 61 people hurt 
when the top of an aloha airlines boeing 737 built in the late 1960s 
peeled off at 24000 feet during a flight over hawaii that accident 
focused attention on the question of how long aging aircraft can fly 
more recent events that have focused attention on boeing planes 
include the dec 21 terrorist bombing of a pan american 747 over 
lockerbie scotland in which 259 people on the plane and 11 on the 
ground were killed the january crash of a british midland airways 
737 in england killing 44 people and the feb 8 crash of a 
chartered 707 in the azores which left 144 dead 
whatever the public perception of boeings name the people who 
buy the planes are voting with their checkbooks 
last year boeing broke industry records for new aircraft orders 
at 636 commercial jets worth nearly 30 billion about 65 percent of 
all commercial jets in the air are boeings 
production lines are backed up two years or more at boeing and 
its two competitors mcdonnell douglass corp and airbus industrie 
and industry analysts say the boom should continue into the 
mid1990s

seven years ago milton wright entered 
a living nightmare 
the american steel foundries plant where he had worked for 19 
years closed bills mounted as he struggled to find work and 
unemployment put a strain on his marriage which ended in divorce 
he sought professional help to calm his nerves 
when we shut down most of us said were gonna get a two 
three months rest wright 51 recalled six months later when 
your unemployment runs out you say hey whats gonna happen to 
me 
then a year later its a nightmare 
wright finally found work as a supervisor in another 
steelrelated plant in this southern illinois community where he 
now makes between 30000 and 40000 annually but this week he 
was overjoyed to learn asf plans to resume production at its 
foundry once the nations largest producer of railroad 
undercarriages and that he is eligible for recall 
the foundrys revival is a godsend for more than 200 workers who 
expect to be rehired an estimated 650 employees were laid off when 
the plant shut down in late 1982 
i cant think of anything else that would make me happier than 
to see this plant open up wright said i have tears in my eyes 
right now 
at its peak in 1979 when us manufacturers produced about 
94000 railroad cars the foundry employed about 1700 people said 
asf president norman a berg 
but then the railroad parts industry collapsed spurred by 
deregulation and an oversupply of cars in the early 1980s the 
industry faced a surplus of nearly 300000 railroad cars said elwyn 
ahnquist president of the chicagobased american railway car 
institute 
wright a father of two who lives in nearby venice across the 
mississippi river from st louis said he was devastated when the 
foundry shut down and had to scramble to feed his children 
you can tell them you aint got a job but how do you tell them 
you aint got no food 
but the dark days are ending now the surplus is over berg said 
and many of the 12 million cars in use now are obsolete or near 
that stage 
in may he said the foundry will resume producing cast steel 
side frames and bolsters which form the undercarriages or trucks 
of railroad cars 
already the plant has 35 employees getting it ready for 
reopening and in the next couple of weeks another 30 will be added 
to complete preparations plant manager william donovan said 
by early summer the company expects to recall 200 more workers 
at roughly a 10 hourly wage 
the american railway car institute an association of railroad 
car makers projects the manufacture of about 25000 cars for 1989 
ahnquist said 
since the early 1980s berg said asf pumped more than 14 
million into the foundry for improvements in 1988 it spent about 
1 million to ready the plant for possible production 
were really tickled berg said were really excited about 
this thing 
so is wright who calls asf the best company to work for 
whether i go back or not i am concerned about my coworkers 
wright said hopefully theyll be able to go to work at american 
steel and say hey once again im a working man i have my pride 
back

japan has decided to alter its monitoring of 
overseas computer chip prices one of the key provisions of a 
semiconductor agreement between it and the united states an 
official said monday 
under the pact reached in 1985 japan pledged it would monitor 
the prices of japanese memory chips sold in third countries as a 
means of discouraging their resale in the united states at cheap 
prices 
the agreement resulted from a series of complaints by us 
semiconductor makers that japanese companies had sold memory chips 
in the united states below their fair market price a practice known 
as dumping 
the monitoring provision has been sharply criticized by european 
countries which charged it regulated prices in other nations and 
therefore violated the rules of the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade an international trade organization 
in a ruling last march the gatt said the european complaint was 
valid 
the thirdcountry monitoring is not consistent with the gatt 
so we will have to modify the agreement said taizo nakatomi an 
official in the ministry of international trade and industry 
he said a high ministry official tetsu mizuno left for 
washington on sunday to discuss a modification of the pact with us 
trade officials 
the yomiuri shimbun japans largest newspaper reported that 
mizuno will seek us consent to discontinue the thirdcountry 
monitoring but nakatomi said mizuno had no concrete position and 
would try to reach a compromise with the united states on how to 
change the provision 
under the arrangement with the united states we have an 
obligation to monitor prices and sales but the european community 
is saying that we have to completely modify the provision thats a 
dilemma for us nakatomi said 
he said the japanese government hoped to find a middle ground 
between the two extremes 
in the bilateral semiconductor agreement japan also pledged to 
set a fair price for exports of certain key memory chips to the 
united states establish a supply and demand forecast committee 
intended to stabilize prices and supply of memory chips and 
increase the sales of usmade semiconductors in japan 
in april 1987 the united states imposed 300 million in tariffs 
on japan as a penalty for having allegedly violated the agreement by 
continuing to dump memory chips and reneging on the pledge to 
improve market access 
two months later the united states reduced the penalties by 135 
million after ruling that japanese makers had stopped dumping 
leaving 165 million still in effect because of the market share 
issue 
japan claims it has removed market restrictions and us 
companies must try harder if they want to increase their sales in 
japan 
european countries are currently negotiating a separate 
semiconductor pact with japan that would regulate prices of 
japanesemade memory chips in europe but not in other nations news 
reports say 
the agreement also would not include any pledge by japan to 
increase sales of european chips inside japan the economic weekly 
japan economic journal reported

the supreme court today refused to revive an 
affirmative action program in south bend ind that called for 
hiring more blacks and hispanics as firefighters and police officers 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that struck down 
the plan after it was challenged by a white man denied a job as a 
firefighter 
the justices themselves last jan 23 struck down an affirmative 
action plan in richmond va that set aside 30 percent of all 
public works contracts for minorityowned businesses 
in that decision the court made it more difficult for local and 
state governments to adopt affirmative action plans that feature 
strict racial quotas 
the justices already have under study and are expected to decide 
by july an affirmative action case involving minority promotions in 
the birmingham ala fire department 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals ruled last december that 
the south bend plan amounted to unlawful reverse discrimination 
because it was based solely on a disparity between the percentage of 
minorities in the citys population and minorities in the police and 
fire departments 
such statistical evidence is too generalized to warrant depriving 
qualified whites of jobs the appeals court said 
the ax falls because the statistical comparison upon which the 
city based its plan focused not on the relevant qualified area labor 
pool but on general population statistics the appeals court said 
south bend officials in developing a voluntary affirmative 
action program in 1979 noted that the citys minority population 
was 14 percent while blacks and hispanics held only 53 percent of 
the fire department jobs 
the plan was aimed at raising the minority composition of the 
firefighting force to equal the minority makeup of the city within 
five years 
the city hired four minority applicants to the fire department 
and one white in november 1980 all passed a qualifying test 
timothy janowiak placed second on the list of white applicants 
he accused the city of racial discrimination when he was not hired 
the 7th circuit court ruled previously that janowiak was the 
victim of illegal bias but that ruling was set aside last year by 
the supreme court which then ordered the appeals court to restudy 
the case in light of recent affirmative action rulings by the 
justices 
the 7th circuit court reaffirmed its previous ruling after the 
new review 
the appeals court noted that the high court last year upheld the 
promotion of a woman to a county transportation job in california 
over a marginally betterqualified man 
but the appeals court said that case is distinct in key respects 
from the south bend plan for giving preferential treatment to 
minorities 
the appeals court said that in the california case there was a 
manifest imbalance between the number of women employed by the 
county in skilled craft positions and the number of women in the 
local labor pool of skilled craft workers 
what constitutes a manifest imbalance remains unclear 
the appeals court said 
but it said that in any event south bend officials did not focus 
on the relevant qualified area labor pool but rather on the 
general city minority population in adopting an affirmative action 
plan 
south bends voluntary affirmative action plan therefore 
fails to pass legal muster the appeals court said 
the case is south bend vs janowiak 871754

an oil newsletter reported monday that six 
nonmembers of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
will cut production by 180000 barrels a day in the second quarter 
of 1989 to help stabilize oil prices 
the nonopec producers had agreed on cuts at a oneday meeting in 
london feb 21 but amounts were not disclosed 
the middle east economic survey reported the six countries and 
barrelperday cuts are mexico 68000 china 31000 oman 28000 
egypt 24000 north yemen 20000 and malaysia 17000 
however a question mark still hangs over the biggest fish of 
all the soviet union the newsletter said it said the ussr 
with other countries agreed to go back to its authorities to 
determine its contribution to the cuts 
mees said the soviet union told the london meeting it shared the 
philosophy of cuts and might announce some measures next week 
it said that angola and columbia which were involved in 
expansion plans agreed to freeze exports at current levels and that 
norway is sticking to its previously announced opecsupport policy 
of curbing production at 75 percent below originally planned 
capacity 
the nonopec producers cuts are unconditional and not dependent 
on any reciprocal action by the 13 opec members who set new 
production ceilings last november to stem a fall in oil prices

the number of working oil and gas rigs fell by 
nine to 757 this week after turning in a good performance last 
week baker hughes inc reported 
last week the count rose by 20 to total 766 a year ago the 
count was 983 baker hughes said in its weekly report monday 
baker hughes economist ike kerridge said the count usually drops 
off during late december through late march or early april 
the rig count is a widely watched industry index of drilling 
activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for 
oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
compiling figures 
among major oil producing states texas saw the biggest decline 
with 14 followed by louisiana and new mexico five each ohio and 
pennsylvania three each kansas two and california colorado 
michigan and oklahoma one each 
wyoming and north dakota saw the only increases with rises of 
four and three respectively

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether an illinois insurance company may sue in federal court to 
challenge a texas mans worker compensation award 
the justices said they will use the case to decide whether worker 
compensation insurers can get into federal court with such 
challenges when the employer they insure is based in the same state 
as the allegedly injured employee 
northbrook national insurance co based in illinois is the 
insurer for whitmore line clearance inc in texas 
in 1987 northbrook sued in federal court in texas over an award 
made to larry w brewer for injuries allegedly suffered while 
working for whitmore 
legal papers submitted to the high court did not describe 
brewers work or his injuries or the size of the award he won the 
legal documents also did not state in what texas city whitmore is 
based 
us district judge paul brown in paris texas dismissed the 
case after ruling that he lacked the jurisdiction to hear it 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals upheld browns ruling last 
sept 13 the appeals court said northbrook could get into federal 
court under a doctrine called diversity jurisdiction only if 
whitmore were based in a state other than that where brewer resided 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the insurance company 
said other federal appeals courts have not restricted federal court 
access in that way 
the case is northbrook national insurance vs brewer 88995

housing construction starts declined 1 percent in 
the fourth quarter compared with the same period of 1987 and the 
apartment market remained especially weak according to a private 
report monday 
for all of 1988 construction was begun on 9 percent fewer 
dwelling units than in 1987 fw dodge group of mcgrawhill 
information services co said housing starts declined 14 percent in 
1987 from 1986 
the stability of singlefamily home building over the past few 
years stands in sharp contrast to the virtual collapse of apartment 
construction george a christie chief economist of fw dodge 
said in a written statement 
singlefamily home construction fell 7 percent over the two years 
from 1986 to 1988 to 101 million units while multifamily 
dwelling construction plummeted 41 percent to 448000 units over the 
same period christie said 
housing starts reached their peak of the decade at 185 million 
units in 1986 before falling to 159 million in 1987 and 146 
million in 1988 
apartment construction was stimulated beyond demand by tax 
incentives in the mid1980s and vacancies remain high christie said 
construction of onefamily houses has remained stable at 1 
million to 11 million a year for the past three years he said 
this year higher interest rates should hurt the singlefamily 
housing market more than the apartment market he said 
the california housing market was stimulated in 1988 by 
developers rushing to beat nogrowth initiatives on the state 
ballot christie said the initiatives were defeated

at the chicago board of trade but analysts said supportive 
fundamentals helped temper losses 
farmer selling of corn and soybeans picked up steam over the 
weekend and helped pressure prices said victor lespinasse a trader 
for dean witter reynolds inc 
traders were further discouraged from buying by the notion that a 
selloff is due after the markets strong gains last week he said 
in the wheat pit traders sold after a rumored sale of export 
bonus wheat to the chinese on friday failed to materialize 
but anticipation that a deal with china still may be in the 
works and expectations that the soviet union may make a bid on 
corn helped curb the decline in those pits lespinasse said 
weather is playing a supporting role and the slightest hint of 
another dry spring could send prices soaring he said 
all we need is a weather scare for the market to respond 
because of a lack of commodity reserves following last years 
drought lespinasse said 
at the close wheat was cent to 3 cents lower with the contract 
for delivery in march at 432 a bushel corn was 1 cents lower to 
cent higher with march at 269 a bushel oats were 3 cents to

japan has decided to alter its monitoring of 
overseas computer chip prices one of the key provisions of a 
semiconductor agreement between it and the united states an 
official said monday 
under the pact reached in 1985 japan pledged it would monitor 
the prices of japanese memory chips sold in third countries as a 
means of discouraging their resale in the united states at cheap 
prices 
the agreement resulted from a series of complaints by us 
semiconductor makers that japanese companies had sold memory chips 
in the united states below their fair market price a practice known 
as dumping 
the monitoring provision has been sharply criticized by european 
countries which charged it regulated prices in other nations and 
therefore violated the rules of the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade an international trade organization 
in a ruling last march the gatt said the european complaint was 
valid 
the thirdcountry monitoring is not consistent with the gatt 
so we will have to modify the agreement said taizo nakatomi an 
official in the ministry of international trade and industry 
he said a high ministry official tetsu mizuno left for 
washington on sunday to discuss a modification of the pact with us 
trade officials 
the yomiuri shimbun japans largest newspaper reported that 
mizuno will seek us consent to discontinue the thirdcountry 
monitoring but nakatomi said mizuno had no concrete position and 
would try to reach a compromise with the united states on how to 
change the provision 
under the arrangement with the united states we have an 
obligation to monitor prices and sales but the european community 
is saying that we have to completely modify the provision thats a 
dilemma for us nakatomi said 
he said the japanese government hoped to find a middle ground 
between the two extremes 
in the bilateral semiconductor agreement japan also pledged to 
set a fair price for exports of certain key memory chips to the 
united states establish a supply and demand forecast committee 
intended to stabilize prices and supply of memory chips and 
increase the sales of usmade semiconductors in japan 
in april 1987 the united states imposed 300 million in tariffs 
on japan as a penalty for having allegedly violated the agreement by 
continuing to dump memory chips and reneging on the pledge to 
improve market access 
two months later the united states reduced the penalties by 135 
million after ruling that japanese makers had stopped dumping 
leaving 165 million still in effect because of the market share 
issue 
japan claims it has removed market restrictions and us 
companies must try harder if they want to increase their sales in 
japan 
european countries are currently negotiating a separate 
semiconductor pact with japan that would regulate prices of 
japanesemade memory chips in europe but not in other nations news 
reports say 
the agreement also would not include any pledge by japan to 
increase sales of european chips inside japan the economic weekly 
japan economic journal reported

after more than two months of negotiations 
drexel burnham lambert inc and federal securities regulators are 
nearing an agreement aimed at settling the largest wall street fraud 
case in history sources said monday 
the sides are said to be still haggling over whether the 
investment firm must move part of its highprofile and bigmoney 
junk bond financing division run by trader michael milken from 
beverly hills calif to new york 
but drexel has agreed to tighten internal controls to prevent 
future securities law violations hire a consultant to monitor the 
changes and increase the size of its board sources familiar with 
the negotiations said 
drexel already has agreed to plead guilty to six felony counts 
and pay a record 650 million to settle criminal securities fraud 
charges with the justice department 
but the plea deal cannot proceed until the firm resolves civil 
claims brought last september by the securities and exchange 
commission the federal regulatory agency that polices us 
financial markets 
the sec accused drexel and four officials including milken of 
insider trading defrauding clients securities fraud stock 
manipulation and other violations in september 
drexel and the sec have been negotiating regularly since 
december when the us attorneys office in new york announced the 
criminal plea bargain that followed a massive twoyear probe based 
on information supplied by imprisoned speculator ivan boesky 
the sec settlement which sources said should be completed within 
two weeks must be approved by a federal court judge 
drexel then would enter a guilty plea to the felony counts and 
immediately fork over 300 million in fines to the government 
another 350 million would be placed in an account to cover 
potential lawsuits by investors 
one source close to the negotiations who asked not to be 
identified said the sides were working on language and details of 
the agreement although the status of drexels west coast division 
remained unresolved 
the parties now apparently have agreed that drexel will move a 
portion of the california business either its equity trading or 
convertible securities operations back to new york where the 
nations fifthlargest securities firm is based the source said 
drexel opposed shifting the entire california operation as the 
sec originally demanded the operation has more than 500 employees 
and accounts for much of the firms profits and drexel argued that 
a relocation would cripple the company and severely hurt west coast 
financial markets 
the firm reportedly has agreed to install an internal rules 
compliance system that will include tighter oversight of all 
operations and add two to four people from outside the company to 
its 22member board 
the future of highyield bond trader milken who organized the 
multibilliondollar california operations in the late 1970s has not 
played a role in the sec settlement negotiations one source said 
but milken and potenial lawsuits against drexel could ensure that 
the landmark securities fraud case which the company says has cost 
it more than 175 million including 30 million for photocopying 
legal documents will continue long after the sec settlement is 
signed and delivered 
the government this week was expected to reply in court papers to 
a motion from milken challenging the criminal settlement which 
requires drexel to terminate milken and withhold his 
multimilliondollar pay 
even if his motion fails milken who is expected to be indicted 
soon on fraud and racketeering charges but so far has not been 
charged in connection with the case could sue drexel to get his 
1988 pay which his attorneys said would greatly exceed 100 
million 
drexel reportedly is setting aside the amount of milkens 
compensation most of which is a bonus linked to performance in 
case it later must pay him milken has charged the settlement 
violates his rights 
drexel also has established legal teams in several states and 
made contacts in others anticipating a barrage of lawsuits by state 
and local securities regulators and investors connected with deals 
named in the charges against drexel 
in addition drexel will announce in about three weeks whether it 
is hiring former sec chairman john shad now the us ambassador to 
the netherlands as its new chairman sources said earlier this 
year shad confirmed he was considering a drexel offer

the offer inadequate

called for the company to buy 80 percent of the company shares not 
purchased under the cash offer would be exchanged for panhandle 
eastern stock at the same 53 a share

energy futures prices finished higher monday but 
below the days best levels as the recent rally began losing 
momentum 
on the new york mercantile exchange unleaded gasoline for march 
delivery rose 056 cent to end the day at 5067 cents a gallon 
march heating oil gained 092 cent to settle at 5265 cents a gallon 
the products did perform pretty well today said john 
rowland a trader at edampf man international futures inc but he 
added the markets are slowing down a little bit 
he said the performance monday largely reflected brokers buying 
before the march contracts expire on tuesday 
crude oil prices also strengthened the april contract for the 
benchmark us crude west texas intermediate gained 7 cents to 
finish at 1814 a barrel 
the temporary shutdown of a pumping station on the transalaska 
oil pipeline which halted the flow of oil in the line for several 
hours during the weekend had little if any effect on crude 
prices dealers said 
one of three pumps at pump station one failed saturday when snow 
got into its ventilation system melted and caused an electrical 
short said tom brennan spokesman for the alyeska pipeline service 
co 
the stations other two pumps failed that night when air intakes 
froze shut on their booster pumps he said

cotton futures prices surged monday at the new york cotton 
exchange fueled by reports that pakistan is halting all new export 
sales and by rumors of purchases by china 
on other markets declines were posted in grains soybeans 
precious metals and cattle prices while hog prices were mostly 
lower and pork bellies were mostly higher oil prices were mixed 
news out of pakistan a leading cotton producer and exporter 
behind china the united states soviet union and india was the 
major factor in the cotton pit said ed whitten an analyst with new 
yorkbased balfour maclaine corp 
pakistan has issued an edict to not allow any more exports 
he said adding that it is unclear if the move is temporary or 
permanent 
the measure affects new sales and is indicative of a fact that 
the world is running out of extra cotton for export whitten said 
if there are any buyers they will have to come to the united 
states if they come to us theyll have to pay our price 
rumors of chinese purchases of us cotton also supported prices 
he said 
cotton prices settled 67 cent to 160 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in march at 5919 cents a pound 
grain and soybean futures prices dipped at the chicago board of 
trade but analysts said supportive fundamentals helped temper 
losses 
farmer selling of corn and soybeans increased slightly over the 
weekend and helped pressure prices said victor lespinasse a trader 
for dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
buying was further discouraged by the notion that a selloff is 
due after the markets strong gains last week he said 
in the wheat pit traders sold after a rumored sale of export 
bonus wheat to the chinese on friday failed to materialize 
but anticipation that a deal with china still may be on tap and 
expectations that the soviet union may make a bid on corn helped 
curb the decline in those pits lespinasse said 
wheat prices settled cent to 2 cents lower with the contract 
for delivery in march at 432 a bushel corn settled 1 cents 
lower to cent higher with the march contract at 270 a bushel 
oats were 3 cents to 7 cents lower with march at 199 a bushel 
and soybeans were 3 cents lower to 1 cents higher with march at 
757 a bushel 
credittightening by the federal reserve late last week 
indicative of its commitment to an antiinflationary stance 
continued to pressure gold and silver prices at the new york 
commodity exchange said george anagnos a new york analyst with 
thomson mckinnon securities inc 
the federal reserve on friday raised its discount rate the loan 
fee it charges to member banks from 65 percent to 7 percent in a 
move designed to curb inflation by slowing down the economy 
its not an environment where investors are actively seeking to 
add to their portfolio of precious metals anagnos said 
gold prices settled 280 to 3 lower with the contract for 
delivery in march at 38730 a troy ounce silver prices were 47 
cents to 8 cents lower with march at 585 a troy ounce 
cattle prices dipped hog prices were mostly lower and pork 
bellies were mostly higher in lackluster trading at the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
pork belly prices remained firm despite the agriculture 
departments monthly cold storage report released after the close 
of trading friday indicating frozen pork belly supplies were 
slightly greater than had been expected 
anticipation of the report sparked a selloff friday which in 
turn encouraged shortcovering monday analysts said 
live cattle settled unchanged to 40 cent lower with the 
contract for delivery in april at 7815 cents a pound feeder cattle 
were 27 cent to 70 cent lower with the march contract at 8292 
cents a pound live hogs were 20 cent lower to 05 cent higher 
with april at 4347 cents a pound and pork bellies settled 18 cent 
lower to 112 cents higher with march at 3782 cents a pound

foreign companies are ready to resume largescale 
steel dumping on the united states if voluntary restraints on the 
amount of imported steel are not continued this fall the president 
of the uss division of usx corp said monday 
thomas graham said a 5year renewal of the limits wich expire 
sept 30 is essential for the us steel industry to continue its 
2year financial comeback 
we cant afford to become giddy he said two years of 
profitability doesnt offset five years of losses 
graham said the us steel industry earned more than 2 billion 
in 1988 and about 900 million the year before but between 1982 and 
1986 the industry lost 12 billion an average of 24 billion 
annually 
the voluntary restraint agreement which began in 1984 limits 
the amount of imported finished steel to 185 percent of the us 
market among other things the american institute for imported 
steel said steel made overseas and shipped to the united states 
accounts for about 177 percent of the market below the current vra 
limit 
despite that graham said the us government must hold the line 
on the amount of steel coming into the country 
theres no doubt that foreign producers will revert to 
largescale dumping of heavily subsidized steel without a vra 
renewal he said we certainly cant tolerate a return to past 
practices 
in the third quarter of 1984 shortly before the vra began 
imported steel made up just more than 30 percent of the us market 
grahams comments came during the opening day of the weeklong 
annual congress of the society of automotive engineers 
the imported steel association which supports an elimination of 
the vra or a 2year extension instead of five years has claimed 
that the limits reduce supply thereby increasing prices for us 
steel something the domestic steelmakers like 
but graham dismissed that contention 
its not an issue of protectionism he said its an issue 
of legal trading practices 
graham also said pittsburghbased uss is prepared to file legal 
papers if the bush administration rejects a vra extension 
we need enabling legislation from congress before the bush 
administration has the ability to act he said we see ourselves 
as prudent businessmen 
he declined to say when any legal moves may be taken adding that 
an earlier agreement barred the industry from filing trade 
litigation while a vra was in effect

national semiconductor corp said 
monday it is selling its mainframe computer business to hitachi ltd 
and a unit of general motors corp for 398 million a deal one 
analyst called a great move for national 
in announcing the sale the chip maker said it broke off a 
tentative agreement with a dutch company memorex telex nv for half 
of national advanced systems 
hitachi which will own 80 percent of the joint venture that is 
buying national advanced systems will gain a greater presence in 
the us mainframe market dominated by international business 
machines corp analysts said 
national advanced systems sells hitachis mainframe computers and 
datastorage systems the deal will tighten that relationship and 
allow hitachi greater flexibility in building the 900 
millionayear business 
the gm unit dallasbased electronic data systems corp also is 
expected to become a stronger competitor to ibm and digital 
equipment corp in helping companies assemble computer systems 
from nationals standpoint its a very positive move said 
john mcmanus of thomas mckinnon securities inc in new york they 
get all the money up front i think its a great move 
jim hammons a computer industry analyst with the sierra group in 
tempe ariz also said the deal was good for national semiconductor 
but wondered what it would do with all the money 
national couldnt do anything with nas hammons said so 
now that theyve gotten rid of it the question is what are they 
going to do with the cash that they couldnt do with the company 
national semiconductor spokeswoman mary coady said the money 
would go toward the retirement of debt and working capital 
national semiconductor announced on jan 9 that it had signed a 
letter of intent to sell a halfinterest in national advanced 
systems to memorex telex nv of amsterdam the netherlands for 250 
million and 4 million shares of memorex telex stock national 
semiconductor would have continued to own the rest 
complications in financing the deal arose and the letter of 
intent expired earlier this month freeing national semiconductor to 
consider other offers said george bragg a spokesman for memorex 
telexs us subsidiary in tulsa okla 
under the new deal which is also subject to a definitive 
agreement national advanced systems is to be bought by a 
jointventure company created by hitachi and gms eds unit 
hitachi will own 80 percent of the company and eds will own 20 
percent hitachi spokesman osamu naito said he said the partners 
will in turn sell the european portion of the business which 
accounts for less than half its revenue to comparex information 
systems gmbh for an undisclosed price 
comparex based in mannheim west germany is hitachis other 
sales outlet for mainframe computers in europe naito said 
national semiconductor has been selling off businesses to raise 
cash to build up its core business of computer chips which has been 
losing money 
the financing problem that spoiled the deal with the dutch 
company came when there was more difficulty than expected in having 
national advanced systems raise 250 million in cash which would 
have been paid to national semiconductor bragg said 
he said memorex telex proposed other deals but could not match 
the allcash offer from hitachi and eds 
national advanced systems is hitachis largest distributor of 
mainframe computers that run the same programs as ibms big 
mainframes it has 2200 employees worldwide including 1200 in the 
united states 
we think its a good situation for us said coady i just 
want to make it clear that we did not accept the hitachi deal 
because we thought it was a better deal in a vaccuum we continued 
to negotiate with memorex telex well after the letter of intent had 
expired 
a definitive agreement is expected by the end of march and the 
deal should be closed by the end of april coady said national 
semiconductor then would be pared down to about 35000 employees 
worldwide the company announced 2000 layoffs earlier this year

a federal appeals court monday upheld a 
judgment against sumitomo electric industries ltd which was found 
to have infringed on two corning glass works patents dealing with 
optical fibers 
the ruling by the federal circuit court of appeals in washington 
affirms an october 1987 decision by us district judge william c 
conner who decided all sumitomo opticalwaveguide fibers made or 
sold in the united states infringed on one or the other of two 
corning patents 
payment of damages and other relief to corning will be determined 
in a separate proceeding by the district court 
optical fibers are hairthin strands of glass used to transmit 
information by light they are used extensively in longdistance 
telephone lines 
we believe this confirms the significance of the contribution 
that corning has made to this technology said cornings jan h 
suwinski furthermore the decision should be wellreceived by 
every company that invests to create new technology 
sumitomo vice president bob swirbul said the decision in the 
appeal was disappointing to the company and different from our 
expectations 
the company has been prohibited since 1987 from manufacturing or 
selling optical fiber strands but is allowed to sell fiber optic 
cable which contains many strands swirbul said 
as such he said our current activities in our fiberoptic 
division will not be affected by the judgment 
sumitomos fiberoptic operations which accounted for about 10 
percent of us demand in 1987 are located in research triangle

a stockbroker testified in the gaf corp 
securities fraud trial monday that he tried to fix the price of a 
company stock but contradicted a key government informant who said 
the broker took some orders directly from gaf 
james melton head trader for jefferies amp co took the stand in 
the first wall street fraud case to be heard by a jury one month 
after suffering a heart attack in los angeles that delayed his 
testimony 
melton 45 backed up the account of trader boyd l jefferies 
who said in us district court earlier this month that gaf asked 
him to inflate the stock price of union carbide corp to 22 a share 
in october 1986 
but under crossexamination melton contradicted jefferies 
testimony that melton pursued carbide stock in early november 1986 
under orders from gaf vice chairman james t sherwin who was 
indicted along with the company last july 
i dont recall mr sherwin ever telling me to do anything with 
union carbide melton said 
jefferies had testified that his firm bought 190000 union 
carbide shares at sherwins request in two days in october as part 
of the scheme 
the purpose of the alleged stock manipulation was to maximize 
gafs gain from the sale of its holding in union carbide after a 
failed takeover attempt of the much larger chemical company wayne 
njbased gaf sold about 5 million carbide shares in november 1986 
for 23 each 
melton said jefferies ordered him to buy union carbide stock 
through the new york stock exchange and keep it at a certain price 
and to report directly to sherwin each day he traded the stock 
he said some days he also bought stock through exchanges in los 
angeles and san francisco to support prices in new york 
my mission was to close the stock at 22 dollars or higher 
melton testified under questioning from assistant us attorney carl 
loewenson jr he said he sometimes bought everything for sale 
i told mr sherwin what i had done and the price at which it 
had closed melton said he said thank you 
the trial is in its second incarnation us district judge mary 
johnson lowe ordered a mistrial on jan 10 four weeks into the case 
after concluding prosecutors withheld a key piece of evidence from 
the defense 
jefferies struck a plea bargain with government prosecutors in 
1987 after he was implicated in the wall street insider trading 
scandals with jailed speculator ivan boesky 
jefferies agreed to plea guilty to two securities law violations 
quit his brokerage firm and stay out of the securities business for 
at least five years he hasnt been sentenced

federal regulators would contribute 905 
million to empire of americas recapitalization under a proposal 
made by the troubled thrift monday 
the application to the federal savings and loan insurance corp 
is a first of its kind but industry observers said others will 
follow 
weve been predicting this would happen for some time said 
douglas faucette an attorney for a coalition of banking interests 
unless executives are totally asleep at the helm theyll all be 
doing this 
if the request was approved by the fslic the bank said it would 
be able to raise an additional 670 million through private 
investors and could return immediately to profitability 
the recapitalization plan demonstrates a means whereby the cost 
to taxpayers of the resolution of the entire thrift crisis could be 
significantly reduced empire chairman paul willax said 
empire the nations 12thlargest thrift with 113 billion in 
assets is asking the fslic for the cash as a replacement for 
noncash assistance the fslic gave empire when it took over 13 
failing savings and loans from 1981 to 1986 
although the bank is currently solvent officials are afraid that 
federal proposals to save the thrift industry will reduce the value 
of its noncash assistance if that happened empire would have 
difficulty raising money to meet new capital requirements 
this is not at all an act of desperation but rather an act of 
anticipation willax said 
the proposal shows the investment community still has confidence 
in empire he said 
willax said the 670 million commitment of drexel burnham lambert 
inc a new york investment firm is the largest amount of private 
money involved in the recapitalization of any thrift 
in a statement issued by drexel burnam senior vice president 
stephen joseph called the empire proposal an exciting innovative 
effort that will result in a strengthened institution 
faucette an attorney for financial assistance inequity coalition 
in washington said drexel burnams involvement was an indication 
that the financial community has doubts about government proposals 
to help the thrift industry 
the feeling is that the government has gone and changed the 
rules for insititutions like empire and that this sort of thing the 
empire plan may be the only way out he said 
faucette said however he doubted the federal officials would 
approve of the idea 
you can imagine the type of reception youd get when you ask 
for nearly a billion dollars he said

loans under the margin rules at least 50 percent of the 650 
million must be secured by collateral such as cash tangible assets 
or stock 
they have put up stock but the question is what is the actual 
value of the stock and is it really secured by assets of mai 
said howard homonoff an aide to rep joseph markey dmass 
us district judge a david mazzone temporarily enjoined mais 
bid last month ruling that the firm had not adequately disclosed 
its financial arrangements with the investment firm drexel burnham 
lambert inc 
a hearing in the case is scheduled thursday at the 1st us 
circuit court of appeals in boston 
mazzone late last year said mais bid raised serious questions 
about compliance with margin requirements following the judges 
comments frank markey and kennedy wrote letters to the sec and the 
federal reserve board urging stiffer application of the margin rules 
in takeover battles 
aides to the massachusetts congressmen said that despite the boom 
in highly leveraged corporate takeovers the sec has not brought an 
enforcement action on margin rules recently

the states vegetable farmers surveyed heavy 
losses in tomato cucumber and potato crops monday after a 
recordsetting cold snap but an industry official predicted 
shoppers will not face shortages 
wayne crain marketingproduction manager for the florida fruit 
and vegetable association predicted that supermarket consumers 
would see little loss of volume in popular vegetables such as 
lettuce and tomatoes despite damage to winter and early spring crops 
we still have plenty of product were still in the market 
crain said 
just north of the florida border georgia peach growers reported 
more than 9 million in losses from the cold however tommy irvin 
commissioner of the georgia department of agriculture said it 
seems right now we didnt come out hardly as bad as we first 
appeared 
floridas 13 billion citrus crop reportedly came through the 
frosty weather thursday friday and saturday nearly unscathed the 
temperatures did not stay low enough long enough to affect fruit on 
the trees 
citrus industry officials said it would be about two weeks before 
they determine how the damage to early blooms and new growth would 
affect next years crop 
but the states 11 billion vegetable industry did not fare as 
well 
with vegetable losses undetermined most industry leaders said it 
was too early to tell what effect the freezing temperatures thursday 
through saturday might have on consumer prices 
there would have to be vast losses in all sectors before any 
real impact is made at the retail level agriculture commissioner 
doyle conner said 
officials estimated the tomato crops were the hardest hit with 
half of the crop wiped out in the ruskinpalmetto area around st 
petersburg 25 percent to 35 percent of the crop lost in southwest 
florida around naples and immokalee and 10 percent of the crop 
damaged in south florida around homestead 
tomatoes are the states largest produce crop valued at almost 
490 million in 1987 the latest figures available from the us 
department of agriculture 
about 70 percent of the cucumbers were reported damaged and 
production was set back until may for most of the crop which is 
grown primarily in the southern part of the state at this time of 
year 
spring potatoes in the palatkast augustine area in 
northcentral florida were heavily damaged 
there was lesser damage to corn peppers squash watermelons and 
leafy vegetables mainly in north and central florida 
crops along the east coast were not badly affected 
i just see a crazy mixedup spring marketing crain said 
with replanting everything production is being pushed back and 
with the weather moderating in the spring were going to see a lot 
of crops overlapping 
some of floridas traditional latewinter crops also will be 
overlapping with the same varieties from southeastern states texas 
and the southwest in april may and june he said 
mexico which is a major competitor in tomatoes peppers 
cucumbers squash and eggplant was hit hard by freezing 
temperatures in january and its production is also way down

the board of directors of morton thiokol inc on 
monday authorized management to proceed with a plan for a taxfree 
spinoff of the companys commercial operations officials said 
the action will create a new company morton international inc 
consisting of specialty chemicals air bag manufacturing and salt 
businesses 
the aerospace business which manufactures the space shuttle 
booster motor and strategic and tactical propulsion systems will 
continue to operate within the existing corporate entity which will 
be renamed thiokol corp 
the transaction is expected to be finalized july 1 subject to an 
internal revenue service ruling that it is taxfree and to the 
approval of stockholders said company spokesman tom russell 
morton thiokol stockholders will receive a shareforshare 
distribution of morton international stock russell said management 
believes the stock of both companies will qualify for listing on the 
new york stock exchange the board will establish record and payment 
dates for the stock distribution later 
this move separates two businesses with distinct financial 
investment and operating characteristics so that each can adopt 
strategies and pursue objectives appropriate to its specific 
businesses said charles s locke morton thiokols chairman and 
chief executive officer 
the transaction will allow investors to evaluate better the 
individual businesses and their future outlook enhancing the 
likelihood that the true value of each business will be properly 
reflected he said 
locke said the combined market values of the stocks of the two 
companies may exceed the recent market value of morton thiokol stock 
morton thiokol stock closed monday at 40 in consolidated new 
york stock exchange trading unchanged from fridays close 
locke said the combination of the specialty chemicals inflatable 
restraint systems or air bags and salt businesses will create a 
company with fiscal year 1989 sales approaching 15 billion assets 
of 14 billion and over 8000 employees 
it is expected that locke and s jay stewart president and chief 
operating officer of morton thiokol will be elected to those posts 
at morton international 
locke said thiokol will be a company with approximately 11 
billion in sales assets of 800 million and more than 12000 
employees ed garrison group vice president for aerospace in ogden 
utah is expected to be elected president and chief operating 
officer while a search for a chairman and chief executive officer 
is anticipated 
russell said the action had nothing to do with the aerospace 
groups 500 million redesign of the space shuttle booster in the 
wake of the 1986 challenger explosion 
the redesigned booster which corrected joint problems blamed for 
the blast has been used successfully on two shuttle flights in 
recent months and will be used on several more 
the shuttle program is in very good shape were very confident 
of redesign russell said 
he said the chicagobased company was preparing to bid on a 2 
billionplus contract for 66 new flights sets of two boosters each 
and 10 development motors 
the company said that under the spin off the combined dividends 
initially paid by the two companies will equal the current morton 
thiokol dividend 
the company plans to redeem its 8 percent debentures due in 1995 
and 9 percent debentures due in 2000 prior to june 30 1989 
although the business momentum and profitability outlook for 
morton thiokol is unchanged from a previous projection of an 
earningspershare increase to a range of 340 to 360 for the 
fiscal year ending june 30 the company expects that significant 
special charges associated with the spinoff will reduce profit below 
that range 
since the operating results of morton international and thiokol 
will be reported separately for the quarter and fiscal year ending 
june 30 no revised projection is being made for morton thiokol

a supercomputer on a chip hailed 
by engineers as a technological marvel because it can be used as the 
basis for a new generation of highspeed computers was formally 
unveiled monday by intel corp 
the i860 chip was touted at the companys headquarters as the 
first 64bit microprocessor capable of performing operations 
typically associated only with supercomputing systems and 
threedimensional graphics workstations 
the chip is crammed with more than a million transistors nearly 
four times the number found on current microprocessors 
the level of integration and performance the i860 provides 
puts supercomputing power in the hands of virtually anyone who can 
afford a desktop computer said david l house intel senior vice 
president and general manager of its microcomputer components group 
international business machines corp and ing olivetti are among 
50 companies that have made commitments to use the i860 said claude 
leglise marketing manager for intels microprocessor division 
the chip performs up to 80 million calculations per second and is 
priced at 750 it operates on instructions that are as long as 
those used in mainframe and supercomputers 
intel last month said it would make the i860 which it initially 
called the n10 available as a helper chip as well as making it 
available to other companies as a central processor for engineering 
and graphics workstations and multiuser computers 
as a helper chip the i860 could handle the grunt work of 
highspeed repetitive calculations while a computers main 
processor handles more complex tasks 
thats a bold decision because it pits the chip against 
established chips made by competititors such as sun microsystems 
inc mips computers systems inc and motorola inc 
intel said the chip will be available by the third quarter of 
1989 
the i860 is built with socalled risc technology for reduced 
instruction set computing that means it cannot be used as a plugin 
replacement for the microprocessors used in industrystandard 
personal computers 
getting ibm as a user is an important feather in their cap 
said daniel klesken an analyst with montgomery securities in san 
francisco the risc battle is heating up 
risc is important because it represents leadingedge 
semiconductor technology which is used in computer workstations 
the fastest growing segment of the computer business workstations 
are freestanding computers 
ibm will use the i860 in an addon board for its latest personal 
computer line called micro channel while olivetti plans to make 
the chip the centerpiece of a new line of minicomputers 
motorola on tuesday plans to unveil its first computer systems 
using its own risc chips the systems the delta series 8000 are 
based on motorolas 88000 risc processor and offer performance that 
ranges from 17 million to 60 million instructions per second 
intel said the i860 is ideal for computationintensive 
applications and those requiring the interactive display of 
threedimensional images such as fluid dynamics molecular 
modeling structural analysis and econometric modeling the company 
said general business applications also will benefit because of the 
incomparable performance 
until today users basically had three choices if they wanted 
to perform these applications efficiently they could share time on 
a multimilliondollar supercomputer if they could gain access to 
one they could share time on a 500000 minisupercomputer or they 
could use a less powerful but more interactive 100000 graphics 
supercomputer house said in a statement 
the united states continues to dominate in processor chips the 
brains of computers even though japan has taken over most of the 
work market for memory chips 
on feb 14 nec corp and hitachi ltd both announced highspeed 
microprocessors that they said were the fastest of their kind 
hitachis runs at up to 70 million instructions per second the 
company did not describe at the time what the chip could be used for 
necs v70 runs at 10 million to 20 million instructions per 
second and its v80 runs at 15 million to 22 million instructions 
per second those chips are mainly for telecommunications

a federal judge has overturned a scripps 
clinic patent on an antibleeding substance for hemophiliacs 
allowing rival firms to continue work on their own versions of the 
potentially lucrative product 
the ruling by us district judge william schwarzer made public 
monday was a victory for the biotechnology company genentech inc 
and the licenseholder of its patent miles laboratories inc which 
otherwise could have been forbidden from further work and possibly 
required to pay damages 
this does a great deal to lift the clouds of uncertainty in an 
area thats previously been uncertain said bud modersbach a 
lawyer for cutter biological a division of miles cutter has begun 
human clinical trials of a version of the substance produced through 
genesplicing but has not obtained federal approval to market it 
eugene moroz a lawyer for scripps clinic and research 
foundation said the company disagreed with the ruling and was 
hopeful of a reversal by the us court of appeals for the federal 
circuit 
the ruling does not prevent the rorer group inc which is 
licensed to use the scripps patent from continuing to sell a 
bloodclotting product called monoclate but if the decision is 
upheld it will prevent rorer from dominating a very large 
market said stephen raines genentechs vice president for 
patents 
the substance is an artificial form of a clotting protein called 
human factor viii found in healthy people but missing in 
hemophiliacs 
scripps version of the purified protein made from human and pig 
blood plasma received a patent in 1982 and an updated patent in 
1984 genentech using different technology produced a similar 
protein in 1984 
schwarzer ruled in 1987 that genentech had violated scripps 
patent but he refused to halt work by genentech the judge said 
hemophiliacs could suffer if development of the product was 
hampered and also noted genentechs challenge to the validity of 
scripps patent 
in his latest ruling schwarzer found 
scripps patent did not describe or adequately identify the 
particular substance or antibody that would make the substance work 
the updating of the patent by the us patent office in 1985 was 
based on scripps claim that its 1982 patent application contained 
inadvertent errors schwarzer said the claim of error which is 
required for expansion of a patent were incredible coming from 
experienced patent lawyers 
scripps was guilty of inequitable conduct for submitting 
patent claims based on a purified product when one of its samples 
contained 50 percent contamination 
a 1979 doctoral thesis by a student researcher had publicly 
revealed the process of producing a clotting product with the same 
potency as the scripps patent that finding would invalidate several 
aspects of the patent
