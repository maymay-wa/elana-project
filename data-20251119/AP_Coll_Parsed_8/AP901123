for almost a decade margaret thatcher was 
regarded at the white house as americas best friend the trusted 
ally whose strong views reinforced the conservative tone of 
administration policies 
among western allies she was alone at ronald reagans side in 
1986 in supporting the us bombing of libya in the persian gulf 
crisis she boldly joined with george bush in sending troops to the 
middle east 
you always know where she was and what she believed bush 
said upon hearing of her decision to resign she has always been 
an outstanding ally of the united states he said i will miss 
her 
there were many doubters around the world when reagan arrived in 
washington with an economic program of freemarket capitalism that 
seemed out of step with the times mrs thatcher wasnt one of the 
skeptics she was advocating a similar program at home 
they shared rocky relations with organized labor reagan 
successfully fired the nations air traffic controllers dealing a 
devastating blow to labor she too smashed restive unions 
on foreign policy she frequently was more right wing than 
reagan certainly more so than bush 
reagan never made any secret of his special affection for the 
british prime minister they were ideological soulmates and called 
each other ronnie and margaret at international gatherings they 
usually were side by side 
two years ago as they met for the final time before reagan left 
office the president said he was leaving the white house with 
considerable satisfaction in the knowledge that margaret thatcher 
will still reside at no 10 downing street 
she later wrote him a dear ron letter in which she praised 
him as a great president one of the greatest 
like reagan she was deeply suspicious of the soviet union 
together they advocated a hard line toward moscow and championed 
military readiness even though she was the first to recognize 
mikhail s gorbachev as a leader she could do business with 
mrs thatcher encouraged the huge pentagon buildup that reagan 
nurtured under the theme of peace through strength she was a big 
backer of us efforts to install mediumrange missiles in europe 
and always seemed cautious perhaps reluctant when it came to 
disarmament 
when argentina and britain clashed militarily over the falkland 
islands the united states was forced to make a painful choice 
between two allies ronnie sided with margaret 
washingtons special relationship with london seemed to slip 
when reagan left power bush and mrs thatcher disagreed publicly 
last year over her governments decision to deport vietnamese and 
cambodian boat people who were fleeing their countries to hong 
kong 
bush a veteran of world politics knew many leaders around the 
globe mrs thatcher suddenly seemed to be just one of the gang 
the berlin wall was collapsing and it appeared as if bush found 
german chancellor helmut kohl more interesting than mrs thatcher 
she was merely one in a parade of foreign dignitaries who got the 
prized invitation to visit bush at camp david this year 
nevertheless bush said he expected the special relationship 
between the united states and great britain to remain on a steady 
keel 
mrs thatcher did her part demonstrating her loyalty for 
awhile she and bush were seemingly alone in their suspicions of 
gorbachevs unilateral cutbacks in troops and arms in europe and 
appeared uncertain how to respond 
under intense pressure from congress bush began to warm to the 
soviet leader now they seem almost best of friends 
on the persian gulf bush said he would not rule out possible 
military force and ordered a huge buildup of troops to make his 
threat credible mrs thatcher characteristically was tougher 
she said that unless saddam hussein got out of kuwait soon the 
west would have to use military force to dislodge him 
she called saddam a loser and the statecontrolled iraqi 
news agency replied that she was an old hag 
now she is leaving no one suspects that britains new 
leadership whoever it is will take a soft line toward iraq 
yet if the going gets tough it might have been comforting for 
bush to be able to hear the tough old line from thatcher

margaret thatchers long and often glorious career 
as prime minister will end with a short ride from 10 downing st to 
buckingham palace 
when the 372 conservative party members of the house of commons 
have chosen a new leader next week tradition prescribes that mrs 
thatcher submit her resignation to queen elizabeth ii the head of 
state 
the queen then sends for the winner of the conservative party 
leadership race to confirm him as prime minister providing the 
monarch believes that person commands sufficient majority in the 
house of commons to be able to carry on her majestys government 
the new prime minister will kiss hands on appointment in 
past times the new leader would actually have kissed the monarchs 
hands and walked away backwards but now the term is only an 
archaic survival in the language of protocol 
the meeting takes place in the second floor audience room of the 
palace where the prime minister meets with the monarch on tuesdays 
to inform her about government business 
the room has walls of duckegg blue armchairs and sofas in 
cream wood and four paintings two views by antonio canaletto and 
two portraits by thomas gainsborough of king george iii who lost 
the american colonies at the end of the 18th century and of the 
kings consort wife queen charlotte 
neil kinnock leader of the opposition labor party is demanding 
a general election arguing that the voters and not a few hundred 
lawmakers should choose the nations leader 
but there is no constitutional need for a general election until 
the governments maximum fiveyear term expires in mid1992 
the new prime minister can go to the monarch at any time and say 
he needs the support of the electorate to confirm his position the 
monarch is then bound to call a general election 
there are two recent precedents for the present situation 
harold macmillan the conservative prime minister called the 
queen to his hospital bedside in 1963 to announce his intention to 
resign his chosen successor sir alec douglashome was imposed on 
the party lawmakers by their leaders 
the secretballot process which brought down mrs thatcher was 
established as a result of the controversy over douglashomes 
appointment douglashome lost the general election a year later to 
labor party leader harold wilson 
in 1976 wilson resigned apparently because he felt worn out 
and the party lawmakers chose james callaghan as their leader 
callaghan served as prime minister until he lost the general 
election to mrs thatchers conservatives in 1979

here is a brief look at the three conservative 
party officials seeking to succeed prime minister margaret thatcher 
as party chief and thus the nations leader 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
heseltine a former defense secretary calls himself a 
thatcherite but if his leadership bid succeeds his government 
would likely be as different in style and content from mrs 
thatchers as its possible to be in the conservative party 
heseltine 57 announced his leadership challenge on nov 14 and 
took a giant step toward becoming prime minister on tuesday 
forcing mrs thatcher into a second ballot for the party 
leadership 
to a large extent his appeal to his fellow legislators was that 
he was not mrs thatcher that he would govern by cabinet 
consensus and that he could help them win reelection by modifying 
her unpopular new per capita community charge commonly known as 
the poll tax and because of his high standing in public opinion 
polls 
one of the major themes has been his ideal of caring 
capitalism which he has contrasted with the rigorous freemarket 
approach of the thatcher years 
i find it difficult to reconcile with what i understand to be 
the core of tory philosophy that there are people sleeping in the 
doorways of so many central london streets heseltine said 
recently 
although as a conservative and a selfmade millionaire heseltine 
favors a market economy he believes in a closer relationship 
between government and business 
heseltine has said he would continue mrs thatchers tough 
policy on the persian gulf 
he and his wife anne have three children

remarkable climb to the top through eight government jobs in as 
many years

secretary to the treasury winning respect for his financial acumen 
and developing a reputation for quickly grasping figures and 
detail

rising inflation high interest rates and growing trade imbalance

kuwaiti soldiers in tanks roar 
through blowing desert sand for the cameras kuwaiti volunteers 
practice lethal karate chops in front of photographers kuwaiti 
refugees tell reporters the horrors of life under the iraqis 
its all part of a steppedup media campaign by the exiled 
kuwaiti government to keep the plight of kuwait on newscasts and 
front pages around the world 
i want this issue always to be in the minds of people because 
as time passes people may forget said amal alhamad who was in 
charge of international media in kuwaits ministry of information 
and is now running an information office at a dhahran hotel 
nearly four months after the iraqi invasion of their country 
and with a growing antiwar movement in the united states the 
kuwaiti government has zeroed in on the hundreds of media 
representatives here covering the us military buildup and allied 
deployment 
in the three weeks since her office opened for business 
scarcely a day has passed without a kuwaiti event all orchestrated 
with the help of the rendon group a washington public relations 
firm 
what we try to do is to give the media a clear picture of 
what the iraqis are doing we are trying to make the world 
sympathize with us sympathize with the truth she said 
trips to see the remnants of the kuwaiti army talk to kuwaiti 
pilots who flew here after the invasion and watch kuwaiti 
volunteers train are especially popular 
the ministry of information has also brought government 
officials from their exile headquarters in taif and keeps two 
people at the border looking for fleeing refugees who can provide 
insight into the situation inside kuwait 
the refugees are then brought here to recount their tales of 
iraqi repression corruption and murder 
some like dr ali alhuwail go on the record and make 
headlines he told of burying more than 50 kuwaiti children in one 
night with a colleague who witnessed the iraqis pulling the plugs 
on some of their incubators 
others cover their faces and refuse to give their names because 
they are frightened of what might happen to family members left 
behind 
mrs alhamad who left kuwait with her family in early october 
said she recognizes that not everyone produces a story some may 
only provide a few facts but each adds a piece to the picture 
the kuwaiti operation has not always run smoothly often because 
of poor logistics 
the kuwaiti government was late in starting a public relations 
operation partly because many employees from the ministry of 
information are still in kuwait and all its archives were stolen 
mrs alhamad said 
it now has an office in cairo and is planning new operations in 
london syria northern africa and other european countries she 
said 
money is no problem mrs alhamad said though she had no 
overall figure on the cost of the international media campaign 
the rendon group was hired because it knew what the western 
media needed she said 
john rendon the firms president said in a telephone interview 
that his company was mainly providing technical assistance in saudi 
arabia europe and arab capitals to help the kuwaitis get their 
message across 
the first public relations campaign on behalf of kuwait was 
launched in the united states in midaugust by hill and knowlton 
it was hired by citizens for a free kuwait formed by private 
kuwaiti citizens immediately after the aug 2 iraqi invasion 
lew allison hill and knowltons senior vice president who 
arrived in saudi arabia on aug 22 said his main job has been to 
produce tv news of kuwaitis and transmit it back to washington he 
said he had worked closely with the kuwaiti government especially 
when it had no public relations operation here 
al mattern 40 of alexandria va who started up rendons 
saudi operation said he felt he was doing something worthwhile 
for mankind rather than just raise money for political candidates 
at home 
mrs alhamad said the kuwaitis who staff an office here are all 
unpaid volunteers like herself though some are getting living 
expenses 
we are ready to sacrifice she said even if i succeed in 
only 3 percent of what i expect i think i have done something for 
my country

hosni mubarak egypts prudent president 
took an uncharacteristic political gamble in leading arab 
opposition to iraqs saddam hussein 
that gamble appears to be paying off experts say as mubarak 
hosted bush for a 19hour visit starting thanksgiving night 
iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 and ignited the crisis that has 
close to threequarters of a million soldiers iraqi vs us and 
its allies ready for battle on the saudi peninsula 
until the invasion mubaraks leadership style was cautious and 
hesitant many said plodding but he had laboriously ended a 
decades isolation from the arabs and was trying to cement cairos 
position as the natural arab leader when saddam undercut him 
mubarak 62 and president for nine years moved quickly to 
marshal arab forces against iraqs takeover of its tiny neighbor 
he has stayed in the forefront of the antiiraq resistance 
alliances were reshaped where necessary he scrapped a political 
and economic grouping with iraq jordan and yemen he downgraded 
relations markedly with the palestine liberation organization 
mubarak said recently that egyptian soldiers would not enter 
iraq even if bush sent in us troops against saddam and asked 
mubarak to follow with peacekeeping forces as the americans 
withdrew 
but the egyptian leaders comment was merely a restatement of 
his policy since he sent the first of 14000 egyptians in 
midaugust to defend saudi arabia from possible iraqi attack 
arab politics being what they are it was a clever move said 
political science professor earl sullivan of american university in 
cairo it cost him nothing as long as his troop stay on the front 
line in saudi arabia and it ensured that saddam could not proclaim 
to the arabs that their brother mubarak was a traitor to the arab 
cause 
in terms of domestic politics hes more respected in a 
stronger position to lead the country internationally he looks 
like a statesman and a leader not a follower said sullivan who 
has followed middle eastern politics since coming to the university 
in 1973 
lucius d battle us ambassador to cairo during the 1960s 
praised mubarak for holding the course despite billions of dollars 
the crisis has cost egypts strapped economy 
the experience has not been all negative the united states has 
shown its appreciation by writing off almost 7 billion in military 
debts saudi arabia and other gulf arabs forgave another 7 
billion and cairo is expecting a receptive ear next week in paris 
when it asks further debt relief from mainly western creditor 
nations that would put egypts foreign debt at half the crippling 
50 billion it was on aug 1 
despite that said battle egypts economy has suffered a net 
loss since the turmoil began 
battle retired director of washingtons middle east institute 
said mubarak has performed extraordinarily well in difficult 
circumstances 
he has a real need for a relationship with united states 
partly economic and partly political battle said from his home 
in washington 
at the same time he said egypt cannot surrender leadership of 
the arabs to saddam or anybody else 
i think he has had economic incentive yes and political 
incentive to exert himself in the arab world in a leadership role 
i think thats in their interest and i think its in our 
interest said battle 
a muchneeded requirement for us is stability in that area 
mubarak is sensible hes moderate as steady and as sturdy as 
were likely to get there he said

two years ago lech walesa and tadeusz 
mazowiecki were sharing strikers rations and walking arminarm to 
topple communist rule they won the war but lost each other 
on sunday 27 million voters in polands first popular 
presidential election will write the final chapter to eastern 
europes most celebrated political divorce deciding which of them 
will hold the nations highest office 
the polls say walesa is far ahead the strongwilled solidarity 
chairman who inspires some and frightens others is striving to cap 
his amazing biography by succeeding his former communist nemesis 
gen wojciech jaruzelski as president 
mazowiecki the cautious and equally stubborn prime minister is 
opposing him 
and now a dark horse has emerged a wealthy mysteryshrouded 
emigre businessman stanislaw tyminski has returned after 21 years 
in canada and peru his fresh face freespending campaign and 
sharp attacks on familiar leaders have garnered him enough support 
to overtake mazowiecki in at least one preelection survey 
three remaining candidates excommunist wlodzimierz 
cimoszewski peasant party hopeful roman bartoszcze and leszek 
moczulski of the rightist confederation for an independent poland 
have failed to generate significant backing 
if nobody wins a majority the contest goes to a runoff dec 9 
the president will be sworn in before the national assembly by 
christmas the election is the first in eastern europe in which the 
electorate is not voting primarily against the former communist 
system rather it is choosing between differing visions of the new 
democratic system 
walesa the technicalschool educated electrician who has led 
solidarity from its birth in 1980 and won the 1983 nobel peace 
prize for his defense of workers rights is dynamic and volatile 
his opponents say he could become a dictator or at least 
destabilize the country 
mazowiecki is a catholic journalist and expolitical prisoner 
who in august 1989 with walesas backing became east europes first 
noncommunist head of government his opponents say he is reluctant 
to take action and will not move fast enough to satisfy public 
moods risking a social explosion 
walesa and mazowiecki were allies until the dissolution of their 
former common opponent the communist party in january over the 
next few months walesa began agitating from gdansk to replace the 
president and the 65 percent of the lower parliament chamber that 
has been conceded to the communists in a powersharing bargain by 
solidarity last year 
adopting the slogan of acceleration he also demanded 
quicker privatization of the 80 percent of the economy owned by the 
state removal of the old communist elite from powerful positions 
and speedy withdrawal of the soviet army 
mazowiecki responded that he shared the same goals but that 
everything must be accomplished gradually through the building of a 
state of law mazowieckis supporters in warsaw accused walesa of 
acting out of personal ambition and suggested he leave the running 
of poland to experts 
by the summer walesa had openly declared war at the top 
his backers and mazowieckis began forming new parties solidarity 
effectively split up 
workers and farmers tended to stay with their bluecollar 
champion walesa and the solidarity union itself has been a 
powerful engine in his energetic presidential campaign 
government officials professionals the more educated and more 
affluent including nearly all of walesas former intellectual 
advisers sided with mazowiecki 
behind the bitter personal conflict are differing concepts of 
democratic leadership in a country where the term after a half 
century of nazi or communist rule is still hazy 
walesa says poland needs a leader with an ax ready and 
determined to chop out vestiges of the old system and intervene 
when he sees injustice he says he can be a powerful cheerleader 
for change 
but mazowiecki says he fears such a charismatic leader 
accountable to no one he wants the president to be a guarantor 
of stability 
also at stake is the governments yearlong shock economic reform 
program that has restored stability to the polish market and 
quenched hyperinflation 
but the plan also cut poles real income by 35 percent brought 
on a deep recession and created 1 million unemployed 
walesa says he supports the tough plan and its architect deputy 
prime minister leszek balcerowicz who might even be offered the 
premiership if the solidarity chief wins however walesa wants 
faster privatization and more government support to give private 
enterprise a jump start 
mazowiecki responds that his privatization timetable is the 
fastest possible for selling half 7000 state enterprises within 
three years 
he says the election of walesa could upset poland as it is 
rounding a dangerous curve threatening all the hardwon domestic 
and international achievements of the past year and slowing down 
the countrys integration with the rest of europe 
if defeated mazowiecki says he will resign as prime minister 
and move into political opposition 
walesa has said if defeated he will quit as solidarity chairman 
and retire until the polish nation needs him again but he does not 
expect to lose 
i was born only for victory he declared in an interview

avon is calling chinesestyle 
instead of knocking on doors in the american tradition to sell 
beauty supplies avon salespeople in china will use the 
timehallowed chinese custom of working through personal contacts 
the first selling job avon faced in china was with chinese 
officials said john novosad vice president for the asiapacific 
region of avon products inc 
the first thing we heard was whats direct selling 
novosad said wednesday in a telephone interview from his hong kong 
office they had great difficulty understanding why we thought 
this was a good idea 
avon in a joint venture with the guangzhou cosmetics factory 
began selling beauty products this month in the southern city of 
guangzhou also known as canton the company has 25 supervisors 
all chinese who have recruited about 800 people to sell beauty 
supplies on a commission basis novosad said 
we expected to have to spend a lot of time teaching these 
people about profit incentive and the selling methods novosad 
said youre talking about a country that we all believe doesnt 
know about these things well it wasnt that way the first 
question we heard was how much commission do i get 
avon which already sells its products in more than 100 
countries is selling skincare supplies perfumes cosmetics and 
personal hygiene items in china they will be made in china with 
imported ingredients 
the companys traditional image in the united states is of an 
avon lady ringing doorbells and spending leisurely afternoons 
with her customers 
here were telling the representatives to build networks 
talk to their sisters talk to those they work with and so on 
there are no limits so it can be done doortodoor if they feel 
comfortable or it can be done by taking brochures to work it 
depends on the ingenuity 
novosad said avon will test the method in guangzhou before 
trying other parts of china which has a population of about 11 
billion people 
avon supervisors receive a base salary but also get a 2 percent 
to 6 percent commission on the sales of the representatives they 
recruit novosad said the salespeople will receive a 25 percent 
commission on their sales he said 
we think it will work here and let us develop a base for all 
of china china once it gets economically going will be a 
fabulous market of tremendous proportions novosad said we 
dont expect to make millions at first 
prices for avon products sold in guangzhou average about 3 
thats onetenth the average monthly income of a chinese worker 
but guangzhou workers are generally better off than those elsewhere 
in the country customers are most likely to be single young women 
who tend to have relatively high disposable incomes

kevin costner strove for authenticity in 
his film dances with wolves shot with many indian actors on 
the south dakota prairie but for some things he went to a couple 
in southern illinois 
bill and kathy brewers reproductions of american indian 
artifacts good enough to fool serious collectors won them a place 
on the movies closing credits 
it started out as a 15000 order for weapons ms brewer 
said 
but once the films producers saw the brewers work they 
ordered more and more the couple said they ended up making more 
than 200 props for the film and billed the movie makers 37000 
they sent us a script and then the set director called and 
said what does the inside of a medicine mans teepee look like 
and then a chiefs teepee they ordered everything bill drew ms 
brewer said 
ordinarily they use authentic materials such as horns purchased 
from buffalo ranchers but they were pressed for time on the movie 
and only one of the eight buffalohorn headdresses they made is 
made of real horn she said thursday the other seven are painted 
plastic 
so convincing are their products that collectors of indian 
artifacts are learning to ask is it real or is it a brewer 
before plunking down thousands of dollars 
the brewers urge prospective buyers to look closely for their 
bkb mark on pieces offered by dealers or at auctions they say 
they are starting to get a bad name for making reproductions that 
are too good 
we were chewed out at a recent auction in santa fe by some 
dealers ms brewer recalled they said we had no business 
making stuff as good as we do 
what started as brewers boyhood hobby has become a cottage 
industry for the couple who work out of their modest onestory 
house in this small community about 40 miles east of st louis 
ms brewer 36 said they get details for their works mainly 
from genuine artifacts in museums and that her 37yearold husband 
also has built up an extensive collection of books and journals 
in addition to dances with wolves the brewers said they 
produced props for son of the morning star a television 
miniseries about the private life of george armstrong custer it 
stars gary cole and rosanna arquette and is scheduled for broadcast 
in february 
demand and prices for indian artifacts have soared in the past 
year since a navajo chiefs blanket fetched 500000 at an auction 
house in new york 
but some collectors have gotten burned by buying items 
advertised as authentic that turn out to be brewer originals 
we made a painted apache gun case that ended up at 
sothebys ms brewer said it got sold 7000 because we 
didnt get the auction catalog until later 
the brewers wrote to sothebys about the mistake and enclosed a 
photograph of the piece in progress she said 
they had to give the lady her money back ms brewer said 
she called us and we made her a case just like it for 250 
because some of the prices are so high theyre creating a market 
for reproductions

thousands of soldiers could be forced to stay 
in the army under a policy change being considered as a way to beef 
up potential troop reinforcements for the persian gulf 
the army has been studying changes in its socalled stop 
loss rules governing what officers and enlisted personnel may be 
kept on in the service even if they are ready to retire or their 
enlistment has expired and they dont want to sign up again 
there are policy changes under consideration army 
spokeswoman judy johnston said thursday 
and one pentagon official speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said an announcement on the subject was being prepared 
since august under president bushs order sending troops to 
saudi arabia the armed services have had authority to retain 
people on duty in the gulf who reach their retirement or 
reenlistment dates 
capt barbara goodno an army public affairs officer working on 
the issue said that in the army this also has applied to some 
specialists in support units in the united states 
lt col stuart wagner a defense department spokesman said the 
army had been working on a conceptual plan regarding this 
authority that he understood would expand it to include virtually 
everyone 
each year 10 percent of the army corps of approximately 105000 
officers and 20 percent of the more than 625000 enlisted men reach 
voluntary retirement 
the new york times quoting officials whom it did not identify 
said in thursdays editions that the army had decided to halt about 
1500 retirements and enlistment expirations a month 
the washington post also quoting unnamed sources said the 
policy change was expected to take effect dec 1 
ms johnston said the changes being considered also would trim 
vacations for trainees depending on the final decision she said 
such vacations could be reduced in length or eliminated 
officials quoted by the post said the policy change also would 
put an end to transfers unrelated to the situation in the gulf 
wagner said he did not know whether the other services were 
contemplating similar action 
an estimated 120000 army troops are now deployed in saudi 
arabia earlier this week the army called 20129 more reservists 
to active duty 
defense secretary dick cheney has authorized activation of up to 
125000 reservists from all services 
bush announced recently he was doubling us troop strength in 
the gulf region to about 400000 so that the forces there could be 
ready to go on the offensive if necessary

besides being a huge exporter of agricultural 
products the united states also is one of the biggest importers 
even castor oil and feathers are on the list says the agriculture 
department 
total commodity exports in the fiscal year that ended sept 30 
were at a nineyear high of 402 billion department analysts say 
exports may be down a bit but dont bet that imports will follow 
suit 
imports in the 1990 fiscal year were at a record 225 billion 
according to a report by stephen r milmoe of the departments 
economic research service that was up 1 billion from the previous 
high set in 1989 
as a result that squeezed the us agricultural trade surplus 
the difference in value between exports and imports to 177 
billion compared with 182 billion the previous year 
back in 1972 when us farm exports were loafing along at 82 
billion the import value that year was 59 billion the 
agricultural trade surplus was 23 billion 
exports took off after that rising to a record 438 billion in 
1981 before turning down during most of the 1980s in those heady 
years of the late 1970s and early 1980s the farm trade surplus 
steamed along at more than 20 billion a year 
in the year that ended on sept 30 some of the bigticket 
import items included 285 billion worth of meat and meat 
products nearly 2 billion worth of coffee 12 billion worth of 
fresh or frozen vegetables 925 million worth of bananas 921 
million worth of wine and 588 million worth of tobacco 
not to mention 12000 metric tons of feathers and down valued at 
698 million the 39000 tons of castor oil was worth 363 
million 
essential oils that smell good fresh mangoes pistachio nuts 
tea chestnuts nursery stock sesame seed palm oil canned 
mushrooms and hops were among the import items 
farm exports were largely concentrated in the value of huge bulk 
items such as grains and feed worth 157 billion animals and 
animal products 655 billion soybeans and other oilseeds and 
products 61 billion cotton 27 billion vegetables and their 
products 208 billion fruits and various preparations 186 
billion and tobacco 137 billion 
within those categories were some items just as exotic as those 
on the import side 
for example last years us exports included 55000 tons of 
horsemeat valued at 1475 million 397 million baby chicks 803 
million 51 million mink pelts 1157 million and 49000 tons of 
lard 
 
washington ap a rise in the use of feed grains to fatten 
livestock is being more than offset in an expected decline in 
exports according to an agriculture department report 
overall the total supply of feed grains corn sorghum oats 
and barley is forecast at 2769 million metric tons in the 
199091 marketing year down 115 million tons from 198990 
production rose but not enough to offset a drop in inventories at 
the beginning of the year 
total us use of feed grain is expected to decline 5 million 
tons from 242 million tons in 198990 as a result of the export 
decrease the report said even so total use is forecast to exceed 
production meaning a drop in feed grain inventories at the end of 
the 199091 season 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 395 bushels 
of corn it is the favored unit in measuring total feed grain 
supplies 
world production of coarse grains such as corn and sorghum 
is forecast to rise 25 percent in 199091 to 820 million tons the 
highest in four years the report said foreign production is 
expected to advance 2 percent to a record 590 million tons with 
the soviet union and china accounting for much of the gains 
global feed grain use was put at 825 million tons indicating 
some drawdown in world inventories during the year foreign use is 
expected to fall slightly for the first time in five years 
the most significant declines are expected in europe where 
corn production is down significantly the report said 
 
washington ap with some exceptions pastures and livestock 
across the nation were reported in mostly fair to good 
condition as of midnovember according to a government report 
the joint agricultural weather facility an operation of the 
agriculture and commerce departments said in this weeks review 
that pastures in california north dakota and utah were in mostly 
poor shape 
water for livestock in the southern twothirds of california was 
said to be in short supply

the offagain onagain attitude of the soviet 
union on using force to liberate kuwait is a problem for the bush 
administration moscows support is vital and november is drawing 
to a close 
the significance of the calendar is that the united states is 
president of the united nations security council this month then 
its yemens turn and the arab nation has opposed most of the 
resolutions aimed at iraq since the august invasion 
running the security council gives the bush administration a 
tactical advantage once yemen is in the chair it would be that 
much tougher to win adoption of a resolution to use force as a last 
resort to liberate kuwait 
theres a lot of ways to get thoroughly wrapped around the 
axle of the united nations a senior state department official 
said recently about the intricacies of the world organization 
there are a whole host of other things that can come up so its 
important to try and do it during the period of our presidency of 
the council 
which explains why secretary of state james a baker iii decided 
to go to yemen this week 
but yemens president gen ali abdullah saleh rebuffed bakers 
efforts thursday to win his countrys support for a resolution 
authorizing the use of force saleh criticized the military buildup 
in the region and called for an arab solution to the crisis 
we knew it was going to be a very tough nut said a state 
department official who demanded anonymity 
the need for soviet support has been the case from the outset 
bush administration policy makers consider themselves fortunate 
that the cold war thawed before iraqi president saddam hussein 
decided to annex his smaller oilrich neighbor 
the soviets are more inclined than the united states to stress 
seeking a peaceful resolution of the persian gulf crisis and yet 
they have gone along with the bush administration on all 
resolutions so far 
even at the paris summit when president bush failed to get 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs concurrence on using force 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater was able to report the two 
leaders had reaffirmed their unity and commitment to have iraq 
withdraw from kuwait 
now the question is whether the bush administrations 
determination to threaten saddam with the prospect of an attack can 
be meshed with the soviets desire to give diplomacy more time to 
work 
and the soviets are not alone in that view several nations in 
the makeshift alliance against iraq agree with moscow and so do 
many members of congress 
whether bush would actually pull the trigger and go to war over 
kuwait is anyones guess at this point but there is no question 
that disagreement within the alliance on the issue would strengthen 
saddams hand 
the soviets of course have the power to block a resolution 
with a veto while no one expects such a situation to arise the 
bush administration wants to be sure of more than cautious support 
from moscow on using force 
and soviet leaders have been cautious and ambiguous 
asked in paris on monday if he thought force or patience 
would resolve the crisis gorbachev ducked well i think we all 
need patience he said but that does not mean we are going to 
weaken that we are going to retreat no we are going forward in a 
very resolute way 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze was equally 
cautious and imprecise when he was asked in moscow earlier in 
the month if baker had convinced him that force might be necessary 
as a last resort 
whether or not the use of force could be ruled out probably 
this could not be ruled out and a situation may emerge which 
effectively would require such a move shevardnadze said 
only a few hours earlier the soviet foreign minister called the 
use of force undesirable 
so with the clock ticking and saddam watching the bush 
administration hopes to cobble together a resolution moscow can 
support and get it passed before the end of november

guadalupe spain ap king juan carlos marked the 15th 
anniversary of his coronation with a visit to the guadalupe 
monastery where his ancestors agreed to finance columbus voyage 
into the unknown 
it was a fitting place to commemorate the start 15 years ago 
thursday of his reign which at first appeared such an unsure 
proposition that the head of the communist party nicknamed him juan 
carlos the brief 
juan carlos took over the government two days after the death of 
gen francisco franco dictator for nearly four decades but franco 
miscalculated when he chose juan carlos to prolong his regime 
the young monarch promptly presided over major democratic 
reforms including the legalization of political parties and trade 
unions within two years spaniards had voted in their first free 
elections since 1936 by 1978 they adopted a constitution 
his staunch backing of the constitutional government during a 
february 1981 military coup attempt helped foil the plot 
in recent years juan carlos now 52 has kept a low political 
profile but he continues to draw praise as a goodwill ambassador 
along with queen sofia easing spains entry into the european 
mainstream under a socialist government

independent 80yearold man who hunted and trapped his own food 
was called off 
milton r trump a towering whitehaired whitebearded man 
likely became lost or disabled in the snow while trying to hike 
into town when his snowmobile wouldnt go any farther officials 
said 
alaska state troopers called off the rescue effort this week 
after three days of fruitless searching 
it doesnt look real good unless he made it to a cabin 
said trumps 27yearold son jim 
the weather was mild nov 16 the last day trumps daughter 
talked with him by radio but a snowstorm dumped 8 inches of snow 
the following day obscuring any tracks more snow fell monday 
leaving a 1foot accumulation on the ground 
trumps snowmobile was found parked along the talkeetna river 
outside of this town about 75 miles north of anchorage 
searchers speculated trump abandoned the machine and tried to 
walk to town when it would go no further in the sparse snow cover 
he had walked out before said neighbor trapper george 
sanderlin 58 he was a tough old son of a gun 
troopers flying over area cabins saw no signs of trump family 
members and neighbors feared he might have fallen into the river 
trump lived in a cabin seven miles outside of town that he built 
himself 10 years ago chopping his his own wood and hunting and 
trapping his own food

dancer

families who missed their soldier kin 
during thanksgiving dinner in fort campbell mess halls expect 
christmas will be even lonelier 
lorraine gould said her husband staff sgt henry gould never 
missed a birthday thanksgiving or christmas with his family during 
14 years in the army until he was sent to the persian gulf 
instead of sharing turkey dinner with their husband and father 
on thursday mrs gould and her three children sat down with 3000 
other family members and friends of soldiers 
weve already mailed christmas presents to saudi arabia 
mrs gould said its hard for the kids to understand because he 
was always here for the holidays 
her oldest jason celebrated his eighth birthday the day 
before he was given a set of encyclopedias and the first thing he 
did was look up saudi arabia to find out where his father was 
there was a map and saudi arabia was just a little shape he 
said its real far away 
jason said he understood why his father was away its because 
of saddam hussein hes stealing oil to make lots of money he 
stole kuwait and he has to give it back 
the relatives and friends who crowded into four mess halls at 
fort campbell paid 245 for a meal almost identical to the one 
soldiers ate in the desert 
this way everyone can gather around and meet other people that 
have husbands in the persian gulf it helps them feel less alone 
said cook foreman sam tugadi who began decorating cakes and 
preparing 144 pounds of boneless turkey two days earlier 
a similar meal is planned for christmas 
the dinner started with shrimp cocktail and ended with a choice 
of 12 types of pie in between there were turkey and dressing ham 
and cornish hen fruits and nuts and cakes were spread across long 
tables 
the four mess halls hummed and clattered with activity but the 
rest of the post was nearly deserted the entire 101st airborne 
division about 19000 soldiers went sent to the middle east in 
august and september 
about 3500 soldiers still remain at the post on the 
tennesseekentucky line post officials said 
lynn quinlan 41 said she came to the mess hall to spend 
thanksgiving with other army wives while her husband lt col 
kenneth quinlan was in the desert 
the units support is every bit as wonderful as my family at 
home she said this is also my family here

two schooners on the national register 
of historic places will not be moved from their muddy moorings to 
make way for a new marina but some fear the sailing ships will 
allowed to crumble into the river 
abandoned rotting and mosscovered the two schooners that have 
been mired in the water at the edge of this coastal town for nearly 
six decades were targeted for removal as part of an effort to 
rebuild the area 
if they touch the schooners theyll be dead first selectman 
lawrence gordon said after the board tuesday scuttled the plan to 
move the ships from where theyve been since 1932 
gordon said the selectmen would never let the town waterfront 
committees recommendation come up for a vote at a town meeting 
the committee worked for more than a year on a fiveyear plan 
for the banks of the sheepscot river where the venerable luther 
little and hesper schooners are visible to thousands of tourists 
who drive by on us route 1 
the panels first priority was to remove the ships to make room 
for a marina a waterfront walkway and possibly a dock for cruise 
ships or windjammers the committee hoped the ships would be 
preserved in maines maritime museums 
now waterfront committee chairman daniel thompson worries that 
the last fourmasted world war iera coal schooners on the east 
coast will left to decay and rot in the river 
but selectman benjamin rines jr said he was offended that 
anyone would consider taking the schooners out of the river 
those ships are part of a family and you just dont put them 
in a museum said rines the ships are on the national register 
of historic places and are part of the towns historic district 
wiscasset a town of 3800 about 35 miles northeast of portland 
has been home to the luther little and the hesper since they were 
towed up the sheepscot river by frank w winter who wanted to use 
them to haul lumber from a northern maine mill to boston and new 
york 
but the scheme fell victim to the great depression and winters 
death trains that were to carry the lumber never rolled and the 
ships were never removed 
the luther little which was launched in 1917 and the hesper 
which was launched in 1918 have been ravaged by fires and nature 
over the years 
the hesper has lost its masts and trees have sprouted through 
holes in its hull the luther little still has its masts but parts 
of its hull have rotted away

american teenagers in germany have 
launched a coverup mission for persian gulf soldiers yearning 
for reading material 
using marking pens and an eye for what may offend saudi 
sensibilities the teens have been drawing over pictures of 
scantily clad people and advertisements for alcohol and tobacco 
products 
the original plan was that they were just going to cut out the 
pictures but after the first three magazines they had edited out 
there was nothing left said us air force 2nd lt bryan 
stokstad who organized the magazine drive 
stokstad of des moines iowa said he got the idea after 
reading an article in the unofficial military newspaper stars and 
stripes that the morale down there was just a little bit low 
because troops didnt have enough current publications 
they were receiving the stars and stripes but they were 
getting issues a week late and just for them to circulate around 
it would take even longer stockstad said thursday 
he said the project was started in midoctober and as of last 
week the volunteers had sent out 2500 pounds of magazines to saudi 
arabia through the military postal system 
we have about 750 pounds of magazines that are left and ready 
to go out and im hoping well be able to send them off soon 
said stokstad who works in the command post of sembach air base 
near kaiserslautern about 60 miles southwest of frankfurt 
at first he said he set up collection points at the base 
recreation center the shopping center and the chapel at the air 
base asking for donations of current news magazines 
then he contacted a base teenage group called life which stands 
for life is for everyone to ask for help in editing pictures that 
the saudis might find offensive the nearly 20 youths in the group 
range in age of 12 to 18 
he said that one of the teenage girls came up with the idea of 
drawing clothes on the pictures 
that way if there was an article on the back of a page it 
wouldnt be disturbed said stokstad it kind of took over from 
there and basically thats what were doing drawing clothes and 
covering things up with markers 
there was a lady that was in an advertisment for brassieres 
and one of the girls drew a blouse on her it looked real good 
he added weve also been covering up anything associated with 
alcohol and tobacco 
the magazines sent include time people us news and world 
report and sports and car magazines stokstad said 
its amazing the amount of magazines we have received 
stokstad said magazines are expensive one box that came in had 
a collection of 40 to 50 national geographics all in perfect

the chief archaeologist was picking dates 
from a tree to kill time and ease her boredom in the legendary 
gardens of babylon where saddam hussein wants to rebuild one of 
the wonders of the ancient world 
shafeka mohammed jaafar has no work because iraqs invasion of 
kuwait stalled efforts to restore the glory of babylon whose kings 
ruled an empire that stretched over most of the middle east 
saddam the selfstyled knight of the arab nation fancies 
himself a modernday nebuchadnezzar babylons most famous king 
iraqi laborers many of them military reservists have been 
called up to bolster saddams army facing more than 330000 
multinational troops massed in the deserts of saudi arabia 
also thousands of sudanese and egyptian laborers fled babylon 
after the aug 2 invasion 
an estimated 100 million was spent on the project over the last 
decade but funds have became scarce as saddam juggles a cash 
squeeze brought on by the unsupported embargo on iraqi trade and 
oil exports 
a lone soldier with an ak47 rifle now stands guard at the 
entrance to nebuchadnezzars partially rebuilt babylon 
before our president used to visit us regularly but after he 
liberated kuwait he has not come even once said mrs jaafar 
47 
hes very busy now fighting zionist and imperialist forces 
she added nibbling at her freshly collected dates 
more than 2500 years ago babylon rose in the land of 
mesopotamia on the euphrates river 
under nebuchadnezzar babylon entered its golden age its 
hanging gardens one of the socalled seven wonders of the 
world long ago crumbled to dust an artificial lake has been dug 
to irrigate the future gardens 
for 1200 years the babylonians ruled an empire that flourished 
as a cultural religious and commercial center according to some 
traditions the garden of eden in the bible was in this land 
between the tigris and euphrates rivers 
under saddam a new babylon has begun to rise again 
an estimated 15 million bricks baked as they were centuries 
ago have been used to rebuild the citys monuments the plans are 
based on archaeological evidence cuneiform texts of babylonian 
characters and descriptions from ancient historians 
every 100th brick bears the name of saddam in arabic proclaiming 
the iraqi leaders efforts to reconstruct babylon 
to saddam and many iraqi officials restoring babylon is more 
than an archaeological venture 
after centuries weve got saddam a great leader whos going 
to restore the past glory of our land its only saddam who can do 
that mrs jaafar said as she guided reporters through the ruins 
of the 8squaremile city 
iraqis are constantly told that saddam can restore the lost 
glory of babylon the stateowned news media and dozens of books 
stress that babylon once controlled the land that is now iraq 
syria jordan lebanon kuwait and israel 
reminders of saddam are everywhere in babylon as they are in 
the rest of iraq 
on the 55mile journey from baghdad south to babylon past oil 
refineries and antiaircraft batteries saddams portraits appear 
on almost every building at gasoline stations and fruit stands 
the road to babylon branches off the highway before the town of 
hilla at the entrance to modern babylon a small town of onestory 
houses stands a huge portrait of saddam wearing an arab keffiyeh 
headdress with a white dove of peace fluttering over his head 
saddam is no ordinary leader and no ordinary president said 
mrs jaafar he is the new nebuchadnezzar 
portraits of saddam and nebuchadnezzar are displayed 
sidebyside in babylon and baghdad 
in the souvenir shop at babylon pamphlets and books carry 
portraits of saddam after the title page nebuchadnezzar is hailed 
for his dual role as a civilian and military leader 
the same image is projected in baghdad in portraits showing 
saddam in fatigues or in western suits 
the iraqi media refers to saddam as fatherleader hero of 
national liberation and standardbearer of islam 
nebuchadnezzar is projected to iraqis as the defender of the 
arab nation even though he lived 1000 years before there was 
such a concept 
nebuchadnezzar conquered jerusalem took the people of israel 
into captivity for 50 years and fought for years against the 
persians not unlike saddams 198088 war with iran the 
modernday persia 
nebuchadnezzar died in 562 bc 24 years before the city was 
captured by the persians

canned cranberry sauce was a common item on 
thanksgiving dinner tables because a weatherdamaged crop left 
growers with few fresh berries to sell this year 
fresh cranberries forget it the fat lady sang two weeks 
ago said john c decas an owner of decas bros in wareham a 
major cranberry grower and marketer 
the crop of sour berries dropped 30 percent statewide from last 
years harvest wholesalers usually sell berries to retailers up to 
a few days before christmas but this year they began rationing 
sales for the thanksgiving holiday and ran out altogether earlier 
this month 
the cranberry shortage was caused by inclement weather the 
december 1989 deep freeze damaged some vines and an 8inch 
bogflooding rainfall on cape cod and adjacent areas in late july 
was devastating leading to rot 
massachusetts traditionally is the nations biggest cranberry 
grower accounting for half the us crop wisconsin might take 
over the top spot this year once this years figures are in it had 
only a slightly belowaverage crop 
not surprisingly the shortage has brought higher prices 
i saw our berries on sale at a local store at 159 for a 
12ounce pack amazing decas said last year the price was in 
the 89 cents to 109 range retailers are getting more out of the 
shortage than those who raise the berries he said 
growers got a much more modest 10 percent price increase for 
their berries decas said

bags with food other people deemed unacceptable to sell 
peace to you sister jamison said reaching out to one 
elderly woman

prime minister margaret thatchers decline has 
been happening slowly for years but the crisis erupted less than a 
month ago in rome 
the occasion was a summit meeting for the 12 leaders of the 
european community which began oct 27 mrs thatcher often at 
odds with continental leaders was again alone in an 111 vote in 
favor of setting up a european central bank and working toward a 
common currency 
at home deputy prime minister geoffrey went on a television 
interview show and predicted the prime minister would eventually 
fall into line there had been other fights howe said and mrs 
thatcher usually came around 
she returned home saying the other 11 european leaders were 
living in cloud cuckoo land 
on oct 30 mrs thatcher was at the center of particularly 
rowdy session in the house of commons rejecting any thought of 
surrendering sovereignty to a european superstate 
no no no she shouted 
neil kinnock leader of the opposition labor party needled mrs 
thatcher by inviting her to affirm her support for howe she 
passed 
on nov 1 howe resigned 
that revived talk of a conservative party revolt against mrs 
thatcher and inevitably interest turned to michael heseltine 
widely regarded as a prime minister in waiting ever since he 
resigned from the cabinet in january 1986 
as he had so many times before heseltine said he could not 
foresee the circumstances in which he would stand against mrs 
thatcher 
wary of a possible challenge mrs thatcher on nov 6 moved up 
the annual leadership election which could have been held as late 
as dec 5 she moved it to nov 20 
on nov 8 the conservatives suffered a humiliating thirdplace 
finish in a special parliamentary election in bradford a district 
the conservatives had won in the early 1980s 
that reinforced the message of the opinion polls which for 
months had shown mrs thatchers party trailing the labor party 
but the polls also began to show that voters were more favorable 
toward the conservatives with heseltine as leader 
the conservatives or tories were burdened by public 
unhappiness over high interest rates doubledigit inflation and 
rising unemployment above all mrs thatchers government had 
infuriated legions of voters by replacing the property tax with a 
flat tax on every adult the same rate for millionaires as for 
streetsweepers 
on nov 13 howe delievered a scathing indictment of the prime 
minister a speech as remarkable for its content as for its 
author the longsuffering softspoken last survivor of mrs 
thatchers original cabinet of 1979 
the next day heseltine said he would challenge mrs thatcher 
for leadership of the party and the government 
confident of winning mrs thatcher went ahead with plans to 
attend the european security summit in paris and thats where she 
was tuesday when she learned that heseltine had stopped he short 
of an outright victory on the first ballot 
she said she would fight on 
the next day she returned to london consulted with party 
leaders and told the nation i fight on i fight to win but 
cabinet members told her she did not have the votes to win 
on thursday morning she decided to resign press association 
the domestic news agency said mrs thatcher informed aides who in 
turn telephoned buckingham palace and notified president bush and 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev

hours after prime minister margaret thatcher 
announced her resignation she tore into the opposition in 
parliament and gave them a taste of what they have lost 
im enjoying this im enjoying this she shouted during one 
interruption by opposition labor party members 
and so it seemed were the lawmakers who packed the seats and 
spilled into the aisles and stairways of the house of commons 
you can wipe the floor with those people tory colleague 
toby jessel shouted in encouragement 
conservative lawmakers including those who voted against her in 
the partys leadership battle were on their feet and waving their 
agenda papers as mrs thatcher came in for her regular thursday 
session answering questions 
her opponents at first paid tribute to a valiant adversary 
defeated but clearly unbowed 
though she will still be answering prime ministers questions at 
least until tuesday this was clearly a last hurrah 
liberal democrat leader paddy ashdown rose to tell the house 
no one can doubt her courage conviction and the 
determination that she has brought to her premiership 
she amounts to more than those who have turned upon her in 
recent days said neil kinnock who had traded innumerable 
insults with her in his eight years as leader of the opposition 
labor party 
but when the house began debating a motion of no confidence 
submitted by kinnock the gloves came off 
the government is riddled with distrust just as the 
conservative party is racked with disagreement which cannot be 
healed under any leader at any time said kinnock 
in the present circumstances there really isnt much of a 
government in which to have no confidence 
windy rhetoric mrs thatcher replied and several hours 
later the governing conservatives easily defeated kinnocks motion 
mrs thatchers attack was often severe but there were frequent 
moments of laughter 
any mirth was lost however on bernard ingham the prime 
ministers glowering press secretary who moped in the gallery 
head in hands 
mrs thatcher said the conservatives had rescued britain from 
the parlous state to which socialism had brought it 11 years 
ago 
once again britain stands tall in the councils of europe and 
of the world she said we have given back control to people 
over their own lives and over their livelihood 
aside from a brief coughing spell her voice did not waver until 
she spoke of britains strong response to the persian gulf crisis 
when good has to be upheld when evil has to be overcome then 
britain will take up arms she said it is because we on this 
side the conservatives have never flinched from difficult 
decisions that this house and this country can have confidence in 
this government today 
on thursday mrs thatcher ordered an additional 14000 british 
troops to the persian gulf bringing britains total to more than 
30000 
when she sat down most of the conservatives stood shouted and 
rattled their papers 
this is the saddest day of my political life said 
conservative member cranley onslow who counted the votes in the 
leadership election 
fighting to control his emotions onslow said mrs thatchers 
achievements must not be overlooked in our tears of rage

president bush trying to tighten the arab 
coalition against iraq held talks today with egypts hosni mubarak 
after an exhilarating thanksgiving visit with us combat forces at 
remote desert outposts 
we wont pull punches bush promised troops in saudi arabia 
the egyptian president put aside his cautious style of 
leadership to lead arab opposition to iraq after its aug 2 
invasion of kuwait bush rewarded mubarak by requesting and 
obtaining congressional legislation waiving more than 7 billion 
in egyptian military debt to the united states 
neither bush nor mubarak issued any formal statements today as 
they commenced their talks at kubbah palace an ornate guest house 
for foreign officials visiting egypt 
however during a picturetaking session the egyptian president 
said that all peaceful means to end the crisis should be exhausted 
he declined to say when or if force should be used 
kuwait should be liberated by all means mubarak told 
reporters we will try all the peaceful means if there is no 
other way it depends on the iraqis 
asked how much time iraq should be given to pull out from the 
country it invaded on aug 2 mubarak said we will discuss this 
with the us president 
he said he was pessimistic about a peaceful solution because 
iraq was not willing to compromise 
i am by nature very optimistic but at this time to a certain 
extent i am very pessimistic mubarak told a television crew 
asked whether egypt was wavering in its antiiraqi stance he 
replied there is no change we are firm 
later he explained his pessimism saying there is no slight 
move from the other side we have to wait and see 
bush got a red carpet greeting bands played the two countries 
national anthems and the two leaders posed briefly for pictures 
before plunging into discussions about the persian gulf crisis 
later bush was flying to geneva his last stop on an eightday 
trip to confer with syrian president hafez assad a bitter foe of 
iraqs saddam hussein 
bush is the first us president since jimmy carter in 1977 to 
meet with assad whose government has been denounced by the united 
states as a supporter of terrorism and oppressor of human rights 
the president said he was seeing assad simply because of their 
common stand against saddam 
bushs difficulty in maintaining an arab coalition was 
underscored thursday when secretary of state james a baker iii was 
rebuffed in efforts to get yemen the only arab nation on the 
united nations security council to support a resolution 
authorizing the use of force against iraq 
yemens president gen ali abdullah saleh criticized the 
military buildup in the region and called for an arab solution to 
the crisis yet a state department official said they didnt 
say no to a new un measure 
bush was in high spirits thursday after hopscotching by 
helicopter across eastern saudi arabia to spend thanksgiving with 
troops who someday may be ordered to war to drive iraq out of 
kuwait 
the president accompanied by his wife barbara came within 65 
miles of the border with kuwait stopping at an encampment for us 
marines bush called it an unforgettable experience 
it was a scene of endless desert marked only by clumps of 
camouflage netting that concealed combat vehicles and other 
equipment altogether the president saw about 5000 to 6000 of 
the 230000 american troops in the persian gulf 
we wont pull punches the president promised we are not 
here on some exercise and were not walking away until our mission 
is done until the invader is out of kuwait 
and that may well be where you come in he pointedly told 
the troops who responded with hoots of approval 
the bushes joined by the four top congressional leaders ate 
two thanksgiving dinners with troops at desert outposts and 
attended worship services on a ship in the persian gulf bush also 
spoke to a combination of american british saudi and kuwaiti 
troops at an air base in dhahran 
i think the waiting is a difficult part of this bush said 
expressing understanding for the troops anxiety and frustration 
but i sense a certain resolve on their part they want to do 
something and they want to do it fast and get it over 
it was a very emotional day bush said these are the ones 
doing the heavy lifting god bless them all 
some troops expressed impatience to get home 
lets go get him saddam now so we can go home army spec 
4 gwendolyn page shouted at bush at dhahran 
army reserves capt don shiarla a financial planner from salem 
ore who had to leave his business to serve in the gulf expressed 
frustration that bush was not rotating reservists and that his 
callup had been extended for a second 90day period 
well stay until the jobs done but lets just get going i 
think its time to make a statement he told a reporter 
bush emphasized several times that iraq soon could be a nuclear 
power though experts put the timetable at five years or more it 
was the first time hed raised the issue as a key component of his 
antiiraq policy 
no one knows precisely when this dictator may acquire atomic 
weapons or exactly who they may be aimed at down the road but we 
do know this for sure hes never possessed a weapon he didnt 
use bush said 
bushs journey took him through europe and the middle east 
before flying to paris last week for a 34nation summit he stopped 
in prague becoming the first us president ever to visit 
czechoslovakia after a weekend at camp david bush will depart 
monday for an overnight visit in mexico

in the persian gulf

by iraqi leader saddam hussein embassy staff in kuwait dined on 
canned tuna fish washed down with water salvaged from a swimming 
pool 
some hostages in iraq were treated to lavish thanksgiving feasts 
attended by news reporters before they returned to detention at 
strategic sites or virtual house arrest in baghdad 
president bush was upbeat while visiting troops in the persian 
gulf first lady barbara bush wore desert camouflage gear and 
waited in a military chow line with the president for helpings of 
turkey

cutting it real close here said marine sgt gerald pennington a 
reserve from connecticut whose unit is being activated sunday for 
possible persian gulf duty 
more than 200000 american troops have been sent to the middle 
east since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 and their numbers are set 
to double in coming months 
also growing are the numbers of needy as the nations economy 
sours 
were seeing a big increase in the number of people who need 
food and shelter this year because of the recession and layoffs 
said maj carl ruthberg of the salvation army in cincinnati in

in a move to increase central control over hong 
kong china has replaced its top official responsible for the 
british colony the government said today 
since the june 1989 crackdown a prodemocracy movement in 
beijing that was popularly supported in hong kong communist china 
has sought to tighten control over the territory before it reverts 
to chinese rule in 1997 
tens of thousands of the colonys residents concerned about 
communist control have sought permission to move out 
a spokesman for the hong kong and macao affairs office said that 
lu ping who has been deputy director since 1987 will take over 
the directorship he replaces ji pengfei who headed the office for 
the past eight years 
ji a former foreign minister with close ties to chinas top 
leaders exercised a degree of independence in formulating policy 
for hong kong the capitalist port bordering south china 
the hong kong and macao affairs office is under the state 
council chinas cabinet and is the highest government organ 
dealing with the two territories 
lu 63 has been involved in hong kong affairs since 1978 and 
was deputy secretarygeneral of the basic law drafting committee 
which wrote the miniconstitution for hong kong after it reverts to 
chinese rule 
he is considered to have a greater understanding of hong kong 
issues and to be more open and approachable than his predecessor 
who visited the colony only once during his tenure 
however lu lacks jis status among chinese leaders since the 
military attack on prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing he has 
been careful to follow the communist party line and has been less 
outspoken on issues concerning hong kong 
the probeijing wen wei po of hong kong said ji and li would 
retain their posts as chairman and vicechariman of the macao basic 
law drafting committee macao a portugese colony is to return to 
chinese rule in 1999 
as part of a 1984 agreement china promised to maintain hong 
kongs freewheeling economic and social system under a program it 
calls one country two systems 
but after the june 1989 crackdown on prodemocracy groups in 
china many in the territory lost faith in chinas promise hong 
kong people also question british assurances of its support up 
until 1997 when britains 99year lease on the colony runs out 
the british government is offering about 225000 hong kong 
residents the right to live in britain according to hong kong 
immigration officials about 35 million of hong kongs 57 million 
people are eligible for consideration under the package 
 
already more than 1000 people a week are emigrating mainly to 
australia and canada because they fear a loss of rights and 
opportunities when hong kong comes under chinese rule

gas station owners say the citys 
latest move to curb drunken drivers is about as appealing as warm 
beer 
uncooled beer and wine are the only alcoholic beverages gas 
stations can sell now thanks to a recent ruling by the citys 
planning commission aimed at making chilled spirits less convenient 
to drivers making pit stops 
its going to hurt business said mehrzad hamzeh owner of a 
shell station located next to a grocery store that can sell cold 
beer people dont want to take warm beer home and then wait for 
it to get cold in the freezer this is a ridiculous law 
city officials defended the rule arguing that the rising 
incidence of drunken driving requires drastic countermeasures 
the city is trying to send an appropriate message alcohol 
and gasoline dont mix planning commissioner mike gorman said 
walnut creek is a san francisco bay area city about 10 miles 
east of oakland

the european communitys drive to 
create a unified internal market by the end of 1992 is lagging 
behind schedule in key areas according to an ec commission report 
a delay not only would affect ec businesses and citizens but 
also american and other foreign investors who anticipate a 
borderless ec market after dec 31 1992 
we cannot allow failure the commission said in a statement 
thursday 
nowhere has progress been slower in streamlining member states 
policies than in the area of value added taxes and excise duties 
the commission said in the report it released thursday 
it also blamed tardiness in many ec states to adapt national 
laws to ec legislation 
in contrast it said progress was being made in other areas such 
as liberalizing capital movement the banking sector stock 
exchanges and insurance 
but it warned that delays in setting up the internal market 
would affect the european drive for economic and monetary union 
after 1992 
the commissions attempts to replace oftencontradictory 
national laws with unified rules often clash with national 
aspirations of the member states the commission proposes ec 
legislation that must be adopted or amended by the 12 ec states to 
take effect 
the commission criticized the 12 ec governments for slow 
progress in harmonizing vat taxes and duties 
despite commitments to set up a unified vat system and excise 
duties no precise measure has been taken said the statement 
the commission said it regretted the lack of ambition of the 12 
governments 
in the ecs view the drive towards a single market is vital to 
ec businesses that have already invested heavily in an ecwide 
strategy 
in 1989 alone there were 1300 crossborder acquisitions valued 
at a total of 30 billion european currency units 417 billion 
a single market is also seen as important for attracting foreign 
investors to the community 
direct investment in the trade bloc by us companies surged to 
1265 billion in 1988 from 84 billion in 1985 during the same 
period japanese investments rose to 83 billion from 2 billion 
the commission said 
the commission urged a speeding up of the drive for a single 
market saying that confronted with a panoply of police and 
custom checks at the ecs internal borders the european citizen 
has the right to question barely two years before the end date 
the political promises 
to make progress in that area the commission wants to 
strengthen controls at the trade blocs external borders and 
coordinate the fight against international terrorism drug 
trafficking and clandestine immigration

the chinese and soviet foreign ministers today 
reiterated their countries demand that iraq end its occupation of 
kuwait after meeting in a remote border town 
but qian qichen of china and eduard shevardnadze of the soviet 
union did not say whether they had reached agreement on the next 
step to defuse the crisis 
both sides are firmly opposed to iraqs invasion and 
annexation of kuwait and demand that iraq withdraw from kuwait as 
soon as possible chinas official xinhua news agency quoted qian 
as saying 
it said qian reported the two men shared many points in 
common but did not elaborate soviet embassy spokesman yuri 
lyssenko said he had no information on the talks in the chinese 
city of urumqi near the two countries central asian border 
xinhua said qian and shevardnadze first met for 90 minutes each 
accompanied only by an aide and a translator talks then were 
expanded to include officials of each sides foreign ministry 
shevardnadze left for moscow later today the soviet embassy 
said he arrived in urumqi this morning for the meeting which was 
announced only a day before 
the united states has been lobbying for a un security council 
resolution authorizing the use of force to drive iraq from kuwait 
but both moscow and beijing have stressed the need to seek a 
peaceful solution 
as permanent members of the security council both countries 
have veto power over any resolutions the united states france and 
britain are the other permanent members 
on thursday chinese foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing said 
the question of using force should not be hurried through 
as long as there is still a gleam of hope for a peaceful 
settlement unremitting efforts should be continued for this he 
said 
foreign journalists were not allowed to cover todays meeting in 
urumqi 1500 miles west of beijing the venue may have been chosen 
in part for its privacy 
it was the second time shevardnadze has flown into china for 
consulations since iraqs invasion of kuwait aug 2 the first 
meeting was in harbin on sept 1 and it signaled a new pragmatic 
working relationship between the two neighbors 
china and the soviet union both ruled by communist parties 
were close allies in the 1950s but split in the 1960s over 
ideological and strategic differences they normalized relations 
only last year with a summit in beijing and political economic 
and military contacts have greatly increased since then

a 13yearold police report raises questions about 
whether a death row inmate committed the murder for which he was 
condemned a newspaper reported today 
two experts hired by the dallas morning news a former police 
officer and a former fbi agent said tyler police apparently drew 
the wrong conclusions from evidence found at the murder scene and 
later presented an improbable version of events at kerry max cooks 
1978 capital murder trial 
cook who maintains his innocence was sentenced to die for the 
1977 slaying of linda jo edwards 21 of tyler 
the news reported today that the june 14 1977 police report 
which the newspaper obtained from a confidential source cites 
evidence that may have pointed to other possible suspects among 
the evidence was four hair samples 
one of cooks attorneys said prosecutors never told the defense 
about that evidence 
the physical evidence particularly foreign hairs on her body 
reports of those should have been submitted to us said john 
ament one of two attorneys who represented cook 
tyler lawyer ad clark iii who was smith countys district 
attorney at the time of the trial said his office turned over 
everything it was required to he also supported the police theory 
of how the crime took place 
police say cook snuck into ms edwards apartment through an 
unlocked patio door saw her sleeping on the couch picked up a 
statue and began beating her with it 
the news experts were skeptical 
i would definitely say the wrong conclusion was reached 
said phil ethridge a former tulsa policeman who teaches at the 
university of texaspan american 
ethridge and jerry dowling a former fbi special agent now with 
sam houston state universitys criminal justice program say the 
police report does not support the police theory that ms edwards 
was sleeping when she was attacked 
the report said police found the television on with the volume 
in a normal listening area when they entered ms edwards 
bedroom officers also found a hot iron upright on an ironing board 
in the bedroom the report said 
ms edwards pants the only item of her clothing not torn or 
bloodstained lay nearby the report also noted that there was 
blood on the top of the ironing board 
the professors questioned whether the woman would be sleeping 
with both the television and the iron on the blood on top of the 
ironing board indicates she may have been standing when the attack 
began they said 
none of the physical evidence inside the crime scene really 
links cook to the crime dowling said theres a lot of 
blood but you dont get his fingerprints on the weapons you dont 
have blood on his clothing or whatever 
i dont know whether the guy did it or not but im not overly 
impressed with what evidence they say suggests that he did it 
the texas court of criminal appeals is considering whether to 
throw out cooks conviction and sentence because of constitutional 
questions surrounding the testimony in the punishment phase of his 
trial

the medellin cocaine cartel says 
hundreds of its members are willing to accept a government offer 
not to extradite them if they turn themselves in but the members 
still refused to confess to crimes 
a cartel statement thursday to president cesar gaviria also said 
the members wanted special protection and would be willing to stay 
in a special compound guarded by the army 
the traffickers statement did not indicate if the offer to 
surrender applied to pablo escobar the medellin cartels leader 
such a surrender by between 200 and 300 cartel members implies 
the end of all activities related to drug trafficking or 
narcoterrorism the statement said 
the government seeking to end a 15monthold war with drug 
traffickers that has left more than 500 people dead responded to 
the communique by extending an olive branch 
justice minister jaime giraldo outlined a series of legal 
guarantees drug traffickers would enjoy if they surrendered 
in september gaviria offered to prohibit extraditions and 
reduce jail sentences of drug traffickers who surrendered and 
confessed their crimes 
in thursdays statement the traffickers were apparently 
accepting gavirias offer with conditions 
these included traffickers request that they not be required to 
confess as the gaviria offer demands they said such confessions 
would constitute selfincrimination prohibited even in the 
united states 
a confession of all crimes committed is not required just 
some of them said justice minister giraldo 
he said surrendering drug traffickers can be sure they will 
not be extradited 
the traffickers said they would expect upon turning themselves 
in special army protection and vigilance by international human 
rights organizations 
the medellin cartel has been blamed for the deaths of around 550 
colombians since the government and drug traffickers declared war 
on each other after a political assassination in august 1989 
during the past three months traffickers have kidnapped nine 
journalists some of whom belong to the countrys most influential 
families 
drug bosses have said the abductions are a response to human 
rights abuses by police in medellin the cartels home city 
they are also apparently trying to pressure authorities to grant 
them a pardon 
in thursdays statement the drug lords said they should not be 
treated like common criminals

a secret swiss resistance force that 
would have mounted guerrilla warfare against foreign occupiers has 
been ordered dissolved the government said today 
the government was responding to a report by a parliamentary 
commission that said the clandestine resistance group was set up by 
military officials outside political control 
the force also was supposed to be used against domestic 
subversion 
but the danger of invasion is receding with the democratization 
of eastern europe and the government is ready to abolish the 
vestiges of the cold war the sevenmember federal executive 
said 
it said it formally abolished the force codenamed p26 last 
week 
switzerlands announcement followed recent revelations of a 
clandestine network of guerrilla units and arms caches organized 
in nato countries in the 1950s that would have coordinated 
resistance in case of a warsaw pact invasion of western europe 
todays parliamentary report said it found no evidence that the 
swiss group had direct links with natos paramilitary network 
but it said the unit cooperated with an unidentified nato country 
in developing telecommunications equipment 
about 400 people participated in p26 most of them weapons 
telecommunications and psychological warfare experts the report 
said 
the group secretly financed by the defense department 
maintained a network of mostly underground installations throughout 
switzerland its commander was a private citizen who could mobilize 
the force without consulting army or government 
the parliamentary commission said a parallel undercover military 
intelligence network was set up in 1980 but it dismissed its 
reports as no more valuable than what could be gained by a careful 
reading of daily newspapers 
the parliament investigation centered on switzerlands defense 
ministry the probe was launched after revelations that the 
ministry along with other government offices kept secret files on 
citizens

minnesota may become the home of mr 
clean charlie tuna the michelin man and other icons and critters 
of madison avenue 
an executive at the museum of modern mythology which features 
advertising characters and mass market trademarks talked to city 
officials tuesday about moving the museum from san francisco to st 
paul 
we think it would be a good place for the museum the twin 
cities is a creative arts mecca said ellen havre weis the 
executive director and cofounder of the popular culture museum 
the museum is based on the premise that advertising characters 
and slogans have so infiltrated the subconscious minds of 
modernday americans that they are the closest things we have to 
myth 
advertising also offers interesting examples of the development 
of art and social attitudes over the past century according to 
museum officials 
the mythology museum was forced to close when the earthquake in 
the san francisco bay area in october 1989 ruined its building 
since then museum officials have been looking for a new home 
although other cities have expressed interest st paul and 
berkeley calif are the two sites under active consideration 
weis said 
the twin cities would be a good home for the museum weis said 
because it is a nationally known advertising community and has a 
reputation for corporate philanthropy 
weis said it is hoped that the decision on a new location can be 
made within six months the museum was started in 1982 by weis 
graphic artist jeffrey errick and media consultant matthew cohen

the american red cross society the iraqis provided the wine for 
the meal

nationalists in slovakia 
hungarys ethnically troubled rural republic tested their 
political strength today in local council and mayoral elections 
the two days of balloting in slovakia and one day of voting in 
the czech republic on saturday will complete the nations 
transition to democracy by replacing councils dominated by 
communists for four decades 
ninetysevn parties fielded more than 232000 candidates for 
about 100000 seats on local and regional councils in both 
republics about 2700 towns in slovakia also will choose mayors 
polling ends in both republics saturday night and the first 
results are expected late sunday 
civic forum the loose democratic coalition founded by president 
vaclav havel is the clear favorite in elections in the czech 
republic but public against violence its counterpart in slovakia 
is facing a stiff challenge from christian democrats and the 
nationalist slovak national party 
the last preelection poll indicated public against violence 
would win about 29 percent of the vote followed by the christian 
democrats with 27 percent and the nationalist party with 17 
percent 
elections are expected to be close in southern slovakia where 
most of the nations ethnic hungarians live 
last month the slovak parliament passed a law allowing the 
600000 ethnic hungarians in the republic to use their language in 
official communications in areas where they represent more than 20 
percent of the population angry nationalists responded with a wave 
of street protests 
hungarians make up more than 10 percent of slovakias 55 
million people 
many czechoslovaks who voted this summer to oust communists and 
replace them with democratic forces have become disillusioned with 
what has been accomplished since 
this time the idea is to choose the best people on the basis 
of their ability to do something for the community slovak radio 
said in a commentary today hours before polls opened but in the 
big cities where people do not know each other their party 
allegiance will be all that matters 
there have been concerns that voter turnout would be low but 
recent polls indicated up to 70 percent of the voters would 
participate a record 97 percent voted in the june parliamentary 
elections 
maybe we are all tired but right now we cannot afford to 
sleep late because we still have to wake democracy up slovensky 
dennik the christian democratic daily said today

a man who was imprisoned for nearly five 
years under a false name even though authorities suspected he was 
lying about his identity was finally tripped up by an offhand 
reference to hawaii authorities said 
authorities didnt know much about the man who was sentenced as 
joseph p caldwell in early 1986 in pierce county superior court 
because his history was a blank he received a lighter sentence 
than he might have if is criminal past had been known 
the man went to extraordinary lengths to hide his identity for 
four years including using an iron to burn off four tattoos 
authorities said 
but an investigator found out earlier this year that caldwell is 
really randall j peters a man who had prior convictions for 
robbery and burglary in hawaii and texas and faced rape charges in 
skagit county 
monday peters will be resentenced in superior court for the 
1985 shooting and robbery based on his true criminal history 
at the time of his 1985 trial authorities were suspicious 
peters wasnt who he claimed to be he appeared younger than 40 
the age he told them and hed given police a bogus address 
but the mans fingerprints werent in state records and he had 
no peculiar marks that could aid in identification said bruce 
jackson chief criminal investigator for the pierce county 
prosecutor 
after peters conviction judge e albert morrison handed down 
an exceptional sentence of 20 years for the armed robbery and 
shooting 
but the state court of appeals overturned the sentence saying 
neither the nature of the assault nor the mans apparent 
unwillingness to give his true name justified the exceptional 
punishment said deputy prosecutor doug hill who originally tried 
the case 
peters received a new sentence of 4 years for firstdegree 
robbery and 8 years for firstdegree assault he was sent to the 
state prison at walla walla 
prison officials also were suspicious of the mans identity 
said tim anderson an investigator for the pierce county 
prosecutor the inmate never got mail or visitors and he never 
talked about his past 
when peters refused to allow xrays during a routine dental 
visit prison authorities began collecting every file and bit of 
prison intelligence they had on him and sending it to the pierce 
county prosecutors office 
anderson sifted through the box of information and came upon an 
offhand reference peters made to hawaii on a hunch anderson sent 
a copy of peters fingerprints to the honolulu police department 
i thought it was a long shot but honolulu came back with a 
match anderson said they said they knew him but under 
another name i couldnt believe it when i got the fax from 
them i called the honolulu detective back and said is this 
really the same guy 
it turned out peters had two convictions for robbery in hawaii 
and two theft convictions in texas he also was wanted in skagit 
county anderson said 
peters was then turned over to skagit county which convicted 
him on two counts of firstdegree rape and one count of 
thirddegree indecent liberties for attacks that happened before 
the tacoma crimes hill said he was sentenced to 33 years 
hill says hell recommend on monday that morrison sentence 
peters to 20 years the maximum allowed under the law for the 
tacoma shooting and robbery

leaders around the world hailed prime minister 
margaret thatchers achievements with president bush calling her 
an outstanding ally and the soviets praising her for helping end 
the cold war 
but iraq said it is not displeased she is going 
mrs thatcher who on thursday announced her plans to step down 
got a call from bush who was visiting us troops in saudi arabia 
he told her we love you and said he was very upset she was 
quitting said a spokesman at her 10 downing street office 
the spokesman said bush told mrs thatcher in the 10minute call 
that she had served not only britain but the cause for which they 
both stood with distinction and strength 
the spokesman said mrs thatcher told bush about her 
governments decision the same day to send 14000 more armed 
services personnel to the persian gulf to bolster the international 
force confronting iraq 
the move will boost the number of british ground troops sailors 
and air crews to 30000 
iraqi president saddam husseins government in a recent blast 
called mrs thatcher a hag but iraqi information minister 
latif nassayif jassim said thursday that while iraq was not 
displeased she was going it was not hostile to her personally 
in moscow soviet prime minster nikolai ryzhkov told reporters 
im very sorry that she has resigned because she was a very 
strong very prominent politician 
the british broadcasting corp today quoted an unnamed soviet 
spokesman as saying mrs thatcher was a historic figure who had 
helped bring the soviet union closer to europe 
mrs thatcher on first meeting soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev in 1984 declared i like mr gorbachev we can do 
business together 
in her 11 years as prime minister mrs thatcher traveled 
widely and established herself as a leading world stateswoman as 
much at home on us television as among crowds of enthusiastic 
wellwishers on soviet streets 
dubbed the iron lady by the soviets before the ending of the 
cold war she was a close ally of former president reagan 
reagan who was president from 1981 to 1988 said in a message 
following her resignation announcement margaret thatcher is 
truly a world statesman he said 
vitaly ignatenko spokesman for gorbachev told the interfax 
news agency political economic and cultural ties between our 
countries have become of greater importance under the thatcher 
era our relations during this period were marked by 
constructivism and dialogue 
czechoslovak president vaclav havel telephoned mrs thatchers 
office today and told her youre always welcome in 
czechoslovakia 
nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner said the success of 
our alliance in the last decade would not have been possible 
without her vision courage and steadfastness 
mrs thatcher resolutely backed the deployment in britain and 
other nato countries of new us missiles in the 1980s in response 
to a buildup of soviet weapons the move was seen in nato as 
crucial in bringing the soviets to the negotiating table 
jacques delors president of the executive commission of the 
european common market spoke of his high esteem for mrs thatcher 
despite their differences 
she and delors repeatedly clashed over her hostility to plans 
for monetary and political integration in the 12nation community 
valery giscard destaing president of france from 1974 to 1981 
with whom she also clashed said she deserves our applause it 
must be said that the iron lady was a great lady 
sir rex hunt governor of the falkland islands at the time of 
the 1982 war with argentina said her departure is a tragedy for 
britain for the falklands and for the world 
mrs thatcher who sent a task force to restore the falklands to 
british rule has consistently refused to discuss argentinas 
sovereignty claim to the south atlantic colony 
the chinese foreign ministry in a statement released by the 
official xinhua news agency praised mrs thatcher for having made 
positive contributions to the development of sinobritish 
relations and especially the settlement of the hong kong issue 
during her tenure

president bush would have a 
far better chance of getting congress to approve the use of force 
in the persian gulf if the united nations first backed such a move 
congressional leaders said today 
it would have some significant impact if the united nations 
granted such a resolution house speaker thomas foley dwash 
said after arriving home from a thanksgiving visit to us troops 
in saudi arabia 
foley and other leaders said they had no commitment from bush to 
seek congressional approval before ordering a military action in 
the persian gulf should the president choose that option 
senate majority leader george mitchell said a un resolution 
authorizing force against iraq would improve bushs chances but not 
necessarily guarantee congressional approval if the president 
sought it 
it would depend upon the circumstances that exist at the 
time the maine democrat said 
senate republican leader robert dole said he would urge congress 
to reconvene immediately if the united nations endorsed force to 
free kuwait from iraqi occupation 
then i would hope congress would reconvene and take similar 
action the kansas republican said 
in addition to joining bush for thanksgiving dinner with us 
forces at several posts around saudi arabia the congressional 
leaders met thursday night with saudi king fahd they described the 
king as grateful for the us deployment and said he indicated no 
impatience with the stationing of hundreds or thousands of foreign 
troops on saudi soil 
dole said fahd told him he planned to visit soon with some of 
the american troops 
the leaders said they came away from their trip impressed with 
the readiness of us troops and their morale after more than three 
months in the saudi desert and other gulf areas 
it was a morale booster for us dole said 
we found their readiness to be excellent and their morale to 
be high foley said 
the speaker said he did not believe bush planned any imminent 
policy switch dole agreed with that assessment but said he 
believed conditions at the us embassy in kuwait where diplomats 
are running low on food could be a flashpoint in the crisis in 
the coming weeks 
democratic leaders foley and mitchell gave bush high marks for 
his handling of the crisis to date although mitchell said he had 
grave reservations about bushs meeting with syrian president 
hafez al assad 
mitchell said assads syria has condoned terrorism and engaged 
in terrorism and he certainly has an absymal human rights record 
neither dole nor house minority leader robert michel of illinois 
expressed outright support for the meeting but michel said it made 
sense because of syrias role in the multinational force in saudi 
arabia and because it borders iraq and would play a huge role if 
any hostilities erupted 
dole said bush needed to be very careful in our dealings with 
him but added that the meeting in the saudi desert made some 
sense because we happen to be on the same side in the gulf 
crisis

shoppers lined up early some of them in the 
rain for todays unofficial start of the christmas shopping 
season which retailers are viewing uneasily amid the troubled 
economy and the gulf crisis 
there are three things you can count on death taxes and a 
big day after thanksgiving said steve podalsky manager of the 
marshalls department store at sawgrass mills a discount shopping 
mall in fort lauderdale fla 
podalsky said the newness of the mall which opened in october 
and the appeal of discount shopping have gotten the store off to a 
start beyond our expectations its as if theres nothing wrong 
with the economy 
but most retailers dont expect business to boom not with the 
flagging economy and the middle east crisis many shoppers are 
expected to browse not buy this weekend 
phil sawyer manager of a jc penney branch in richmond va 
predicted sales would slack off after a burst of buying today 
similar to the business his store had during a previous economic 
slowdown 
wanda mcnamara of new cumberland pa said today she has not 
been personally threatened with layoffs or loss of income still 
she is taking the recession talk seriously and this shopping season 
will be different for her 
im watching my dollars she said this morning while waiting 
for boscovs department store to open in harrisburg pa im more 
careful more selective im looking for sales im cutting down on 
the christmas list i dont want to overcharge too much 
stores generally make half their annual profits during the 
christmas season the thanksgiving weekend isnt quite as crucial 
for retailers as it once was though 
shoppers setting out after getting their fill of turkey and 
football games used to give retailers their biggest threeday take 
and set the tone for the rest of the christmas period but in 
recent years as more women joined the workforce consumers have 
been shopping later and later 
now the last 10 days before christmas matter most though 
thanksgiving weekend sales help determine retailers strategy for 
the rest of the season 
retailers biggest hope this season is to avoid the steep 
markdowns that decimated earnings last christmas many companies 
competing with the department stores owned by campeau corp had to 
slash prices after campeaus units in a futile attempt at staying 
out of bankruptcy court took heavy markdowns to bring in sales 
christmas 1989 devastated some retailers most notably rh macy 
amp co which was among those forced to take markdowns and ended up 
with a 39 million loss in the second quarter of its fiscal year 
analysts believe there will be some markdowns this year but 
just how severe the price cuts will be depends on how the season 
progresses 
edward johnson an analyst with prescott ball amp turben said 
stores began taking markdowns a few weeks ago but theyre still 
not as bad as they were last year 
if this weekend goes poorly johnson said retailers may begin 
their markdowns early in hopes of increasing sales 
manufacturers also are concerned about the success of this 
weekend theyre waiting to see how well their products sell and 
whether stores that have stocked their shelves conservatively place 
reorders

two cabinet ministers launched campaigns today to 
succeed prime minister margaret thatcher and they emphasized unity 
in lowkey appeals to a conservative party in shock after dumping 
its leader 
against everybodys wishes in the party weve got ourselves 
into a mess said foreign secretary douglas hurd we can only 
get ourselves out of the mess by rallying everybody by healing the 
wounds 
hurd 60 and chancellor of the exchequer john major 47 joined 
the race on thursday both hoping to block exdefense secretary 
michael heseltine 
heseltines strong solo challenge to mrs thatcher in a 
firstround vote this week precipitated her dramatic resignation 
thursday that opened the way for cabinet ministers to run in the 
next ballot among the 372 conservative legislators in the house of 
commons 
while the contenders battled for her job mrs thatcher remained 
at her 10 downing street office messages of support and good will 
poured in from the worlds leaders her aides said 
shes very well shes feeling fine said conservative party 
chairman kenneth baker as he emerged from the building 
president bush telephoned on thursday and told mrs thatcher 
we love you in a 10minute conversation 
mrs thatcher is considered a staunch us ally whose tough 
freemarket policies dismantled much of britains welfare state and 
sold off government industries 
the british broadcasting corp reported that mrs thatcher and 
her husband denis began arranging to remove personal belongings 
from downing street where she has lived for 11 years 
reporters and television crews camped otside no 10 and no 11 
downing street the home of major the chief treasury official he 
is widely regarded as being the most rightwing of the three 
candidates and thus closest politically to mrs thatcher 
hurd and major argued today there was scant differences in their 
views 
both promised improvements in an unpopular local services 
tax on every adult heseltine has pledged what he calls a 
fullscale review 
that tax and high inflation and interest rates have hurt the 
conservatives and mrs thatchers government in addition mrs 
thatchers long tenure her combative attitude on europe and what 
critics called her dictatorial manner alienated some close cabinet 
colleagues 
in a first round of balloting for the party leadership post on 
tuesday mrs thatcher needed to beat heseltine by 15 percent of 
the eligible voters but fell four votes short 
this precipitated the second round of balloting scheduled for 
next tuesday if no winner emerges on a simple majority a third 
and final round is scheduled for nov 29 
a prime asset for heseltine has been a series of polls showing 
that the tories 16month lag behind the labor party in ratings 
would narrow or even disappear with him as party leader 
mrs thatcher resigned after cabinet ministers and her campaign 
manager told her in private interviews wednesday that she would 
lose to heseltine in the second round where a simple majority is 
required 
the independent reported today that a tearful mrs thatcher told 
the cabinet she had been forced out despite her three general 
election victories and widespread support among conservative party 
members outside the commons 
the london newspaper said the strongwilled mrs thatcher once 
dubbed the iron lady by the soviets was reported to have added 
wryly its a funny old world 
despite the domestic drama the cabinet also decided to send 
14000 more troops to the persian gulf bringing the british forces 
there to 30000 
in a bravura performance in the house of commons thursday 
afternoon mrs thatcher defended her governments record and led a 
nearly unanimous conservative party in defeating a labor party 
noconfidence motion aimed at her government 
outside downing street 250 leftwing demonstrators sang danced 
and chanted antithatcher slogans as her limousine swept past on 
thursday night police reported 13 arrests 
mrs thatchers son mark told reporters at downing street 
today that he felt no bitterness 
i think its very wrong to criticize the system which got us 
elected 15 years ago just because it did not produce the result we 
wanted he said 
rebellion against mrs thatcher had been building for years but 
news she had walked away from a fight surprised the world 
she was britains first woman prime minister europes 
longestserving prime minister in this century and the only one to 
win three consecutive elections

premier andrei lukanov today defeated a 
noconfidence motion pressed by political opponents seeking to oust 
his socialist government 
the opposition won 159 votes for the motion in a secret ballot 
in the 400seat grand national assembly but 201 deputies voted 
with lukanov 
the vote came a day after lawmakers approved lukanovs austerity 
budget in a vote boycotted by the opposition lukanov had 
threatened to resign if the budget failed 
the socialists the former communists won june elections have 
210 seats in parliament 
prior to the vote lukanov defended himself against charges by 
the opposition that his government was ineffective in implementing 
reforms 
there have been growing demands for lukanovs resignation on 
thursday about 50000 people demonstrated outside the parliament 
building 
alexander yordanov of the opposition union of democratic forces 
called thursday for a new government and said his group was 
prepared to take over if necessary 
the inability of the government to improve the rapidly 
deteriorating economic situation and supplies of scarce foodstuffs 
and consumer goods has fired anger among the countrys frustrated 
citizens 
opposition eaders claim they would triumph in new elections 
and that bulgaria would win greater international support under an 
oppositionled government 
but lukanov told the house that international support does not 
depend on the color of the government 
the premier who returned to sofia thursday from a 34nation 
paris summit said recent international contacts let him see that 
no one would help a country in which there is no stability in 
which the reforms are not decisively implemented 
the opposition has repeatedly rejected lukanovs requests to 
join a broad socialistled coalition government insisting instead 
on naming the premier and holding key ministries

cambodias warring factions remained far apart 
today as diplomats held talks to revive a united nations peace plan 
aimed at holding free elections in the nation 
the sole difficulty at this point comes from the cambodians 
themselves a foreign ministry spokesman said as representatives 
of the five permanent un security council members met behind 
closed doors 
they were joined by representatives of indonesia and un 
secretary general javier perez de cuellar for two days of talks 
the stalled peace plan envisions putting cambodia under un 
administration while elections can be organized it would be the 
first time for the united nations to fully administer a country 
cambodia would be guided during this period by a supreme 
national council of six representatives of the phnom penh 
government and six from the threefaction guerrilla resistance 
coalition 
the plan is deadlocked however over who will lead the council 
the resistance groups back former ruler prince norodom sihanouk 
the government wants prime minister hun sen 
sihanouk the coalitions nominal leader arrived in paris on 
wednesday for what he called a private visit ahead of the talks 
the un security council members participating are the united 
states soviet union france britain and china 
it is sihanouks first visit to paris since september 1989 when 
an international conference on cambodia collapsed over his refusal 
to spurn the brutal khmer rouge the strongest guerrilla faction in 
the resistence 
sihanouk lunched thursday with former cambodian prime minister 
son sann the two men lead the other guerrilla factions fighting 
hun sens vietnameseinstalled government 
son sann announced late thursday that he would try to end the 
current impasse by giving up his claim for a seat as vice chairman 
on the supreme national council to set a good example 
the cambodian war began when vietnam invaded in late 1978 and 
drove the khmer rouge from power the khmer rouge had ruled for 
three years during which hundreds of thousands of cambodians died 
vietnam withdrew troops last year and has been cooperating in 
the peace talks

the environmental protection agency has 
decided to veto construction of the two forks dam in colorado the 
largest nonfederal water project in the west it was reported 
today 
the washington post said epa administrator william k reilly is 
expected within a few days to announce a decision to block the 
billiondollar dam which the city of denver had sought to increase 
water supplies for its suburbs 
but epa officials said today that while action will be taken 
soon on a review boards recommendation that no dam be built at the 
site no decision has yet been made 
the officials who commented on condition they not be identified 
by name said riley will not make the decision himself but has 
delegated it to lajuana s wilcher the epas assistant 
administrator for water 
one official confirmed that ms wilcher is working on a 
document but added until it is final it is inappropriate to 
tell you whats in it 
the dam has been the focus of an intense battle between 
environmentalists and supporters of increased development 
the proposed project called for flooding much of cheesman 
canyon a wilderness area between two forks of the south platte 
river 
the post said it obtained a draft of the decision which said 
the dam would lead to unacceptable adverse effects including 
loss and damage to fisheries and recreational opportunities 
denver has practicable less environmentally damaging 
alternatives to provide water for the new suburbs in the front 
range of the rocky mountains reilly is quoted as saying 
monte pascoe a denver water board commissioner told the post 
the decision is unbelievably shortsighted youre saying squeeze 
more out of the existing system and get right up to a drought 
before you recognize the problem 
the army corps of engineers in march 1989 approved a permit to 
build the dam and former reagan administration officials had 
indicated support for the project

former president reagan thanked british prime 
minister margaret thatcher for backing him up when other allies 
backed down heaping praise on his political soulmate as she heads 
off into the sunset 
margaret thatcher was a completely reliable ally and partner 
of the greatest personal integrity reagan said in a statement 
after mrs thatcher announced her impending retirement 
i could always count on her wise counsel her firm support 
and her loyal friendship reagan said 
mrs thatcher on thursday succumbed to the challenge mounted by 
michael heseltine who resigned as her defense minister in 1986 
reagan and the prime minister dubbed the iron lady formed a 
formidable duo in the 1980s and made no secret of their mutual 
regard they often stood sidebyside at international gatherings 
and called each other ronnie and margaret 
two years ago as they met for the final time before reagan left 
office the president said he was leaving the white house with 
considerable satisfaction in the knowledge that margaret thatcher 
will still reside at no 10 downing street 
reagan who spent thanksgiving with friends at his belair home 
called her resignation in the face of strong opposition a 
selfless and courageous decision in what she believes is the best 
interests of her country 
the former chief executive was always grateful to mrs 
thatchers support of his conservative approach to foreign affairs 
during his own eightyear tenure 
in 1986 when the us bombing of libya was criticized by world 
powers mrs thatcher was the only ally who supported reagan and 
allowed the bombers to fly from british bases 
when britain fought argentina for the falkland islands the 
united states was forced to choose between two allies reagan sided 
with mrs thatcher 
she also encouraged reagans nurturing of the huge pentagon 
buildup and backed us efforts to install mediumrange missiles 
in europe despite opposition from nato allies 
both leaders adopted a hard line toward the soviet union but 
were quick to warm up to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev as 
the cold war thawed 
reagan credited mrs thatchers resoluteness for playing a 
key role in ending the tensions between the western democracies and 
the eastern block 
she stood up to the soviets and let them know she meant 
business he said 
both were ardent advocates of the free market and private 
enterprise 
while the united states became mired in debt in the era of 
reaganomics the british economy thrived on mrs thatchers radical 
policies during her nearly 12year rule average earnings were up 
by nearly onethird and more britons owned their homes during her 
tenor 
like reagan however mrs thatcher was accused by liberals of 
widening the gap between the rich and poor in her country and both 
clashed with organized labor

israel said friday it would repair a leaky roof 
at the church of the nativity built at the site where tradition 
says jesus was born because feuding christian sects cant agree on 
who is responsible for upkeep 
repairs at the church in the occupied west bank town of 
bethlehem will begin in a few days and should be completed by 
christmas said shmuel hamburger a military government official 
the roof is in such bad shape that the last time we had rain 
two weeks ago it was pouring inside the church he said 
he said there were gaping holes in the woodandtar roof last 
christmas buckets for rainwater were set out inside the basilica 
the dispute stems from the intense rivalry between christian 
sects over custody of the holy sites 
rights of worship and maintenance are spelled out in minute 
detail in a set of rules dating back to the 1850s however 
jurisdiction over the roof of the church of the nativity is not 
specifically mentioned in the rules 
in the past area authorities the ottomans the british the 
jordanians and finally the israelis fixed the roof periodically 
to prevent squabbles among the sects 
but this year the greek orthodox church insisted on fixing the 
roof saying it traditionally cleaned the roof and therefore should 
be allowed to do the repairs the rival armenian and roman catholic 
churches protested saying the roof should be fixed by all three 
groups or not at all 
the israelis stepped in several months ago with an offer to do 
the repairs but the armenians and roman catholics asked that the 
work be postponed 
the offer came at a time when the christian communities in 
jerusalem were incensed that the government supported jewish 
settlers trying to take over greek orthodox church property near 
the church of the holy sepulcher where tradition says jesus was 
buried 
hamburger said that since then the armenians and roman 
catholics have changed their minds now they want us to repair 
the roof he said 
he said he has not contacted greek orthodox church officials in 
the past few months and didnt know whether they also had a change 
of heart however hamburger said israel had a right to carry out 
the repairs even if the greek orthodox opposed it 
but the greek orthodox appeared insistent that they should have 
custody of the roof twice in the past week greek orthodox sneaked 
onto the roof to start repairs both efforts drew protests from the 
other sects and the army intervened 
bishop palladios who answered the phone at the greek orthodox 
patriarchate in jerusalem said he could not comment on the case 
he referred all calls to the patriarch who is visiting athens the 
patriarch could not be reached for comment in greece 
the church of the nativity on bethlehems manger square was 
built by constantine in the year 330 and restored and enlarged in 
the sixth century by byzantine emperor justinian 
the structure believed to be the oldest christian church in 
continuous use was erected over a grotto believed to be the site 
where jesus was born

the national legislature today asked its chairman 
to begin talks with the 15 soviet republics to reach temporary 
agreements to prevent the further breakup of the country and 
stabilize the economy 
acting on a package of proposals the lawmakers also endorsed 
for a second time inh a week president mikhail s gorbachevs 
proposed restructuring of the government it called on the soviet 
leader to act quickly to improve food supplies 
the lawmakers asked gorbachev to act within two weeks to assure 
that there will be enough food this winter in the past month he 
has been touring western europe in search of foreign food aid and 
he has received several offers 
the resolution contained a gloomy assessment of the nations 
economic and political affairs the situation in the country 
continues to worsen and is approaching a crisis condition it 
said 
another resolution passed recommended that gorbachev take all 
steps authorized by law up to extraordinary measures in cases 
where there is a threat to human life health or property 
that measure removed a requirement for the president to consult 
with leaders of the republics before taking such measures and gave 
the kgb responsibility for dealing with what it called economic 
sabotage 
in a 10minute speech gorbachev told the 542member legislature 
that every day is precious and urged them to move swiftly 
toward a new union treaty to replace a 1924 accord uniting the 
republics 
the legislature voted to ask its chairman anatoly lukyanov to 
urgently begin negotiations with the leaders of the parliaments in 
the 15 republics for a temporary series of agreements to keep the 
country together 
legislative work on a union treaty is going slowly and the 
countrys republics increasingly are disregarding kremlin 
authority the resolution said provisional agreements with the 
republics would help stabilize the social and economic situation 
in the country 
so far each republic has acted independently in introducing 
reforms to switch to a free market economy all but one of the 
countrys republics have declared sovereignty from the kremlin 
the result has been what many call a paralysis of power that 
has hindered any reform and caused a breakdown of the countrys 
political and economic life 
the supreme soviet said in its resolution that agreements should 
be reached with the republics to stop legal contradictions in 
their drives for sovereignty or outright independence the 
republics have passed laws that ignore or even contradict national 
legislation 
some politicians have suggested a temporary moratorium on 
republican legislation that contradicts national laws 
gorbachevs main political rival russian federation president 
boris n yeltsin has urged the republics not to wait for approval 
of a new union treaty and to create their own economic structure 
russia the biggest republic has signed four bilateral treaties 
with other republics that bypass the kremlin and govern trade 
cultural and political ties 
in his speech gorbachev appeared to take a swipe at yeltsin 
gorbachev warned the lawmakers that there are forces that 
dont want to normalize the situation 
he blasted people who criticize his reforms as an attempt at 
dictatorship an attempt to go for the jugular to take 
advantage of the situation opponents he said really want to 
let the paralysis of power continue 
gorbachevs proposals to restructure the government are aimed at 
ridding the power structure of officials resistant to radical 
reform and bringing in representatives of the republics 
todays resolution also endorsed gorbachevs proposal to 
eliminate the council of ministers or soviet cabinet and make 
another body the highest state organ that proposal has a number of 
other legislative hurdles before it becomes law 
the lawmakers told the president today to submit more concrete 
definitions of what each new government body would do within two 
weeks 
under the outline the council of ministers would be replaced by 
several bodies under direct presidential control the principal 
ruling body would be the federation council grouping 
representatives of the republics 
many of gorbachevs proposals will require constitutional 
amendments which must be adopted by the supreme soviets parent 
body the congress of peoples deputies

several retired people have added to their 
pension by selling sleeping pills and other statesubsidized 
medicines on the drug market police said 
mind you this is not the average retired person doing this 
the people involved are those who have had problems with drugs 
themselves said thor carsten pedersen a senior police official 
in kristiansand a town in southern norway 
they have sold sleeping pills and tranquilizers the 
sleeping pills at about 10 kroner 170 per pill pedersen 
said 
he said one pensioner had been caught and would probably be 
fined police had been tipped of a few others involved 
kristiansand a coastal town of about 65000 people has in the 
past decade had growing problems with heavy drugs including 
heroin 
prescribed medicines are heavily subsidized in this welfare 
state and retired people are big consumers 
pedersen said the biggest problem in kristiansand was not 
pensioners selling medicines in the street but doctors prescribing 
too many sleeping pills and tranquilizers to young people with 
problems

an army reserves helicopter on a night 
training mission crashed into lake ellsworth and five crew members 
were pulled to safety aboard a fishing boat a sixth was missing 
authorities said today 
the pilot who was among the survivors was wearing night 
goggles for an overwater training exercise when the uh1 
helicopter crashed thursday night said fort sill spokesman maj 
chuck pope 
the news is good about the five pope said early today we 
dont know about the sixth 
two have a bit of hypothermia one was shaken up a bit and the 
other two are fine he said 
divers in wet suits searched the southwestern oklahoma lake this 
morning for the missing soldier a helicopter like the one that 
crashed was parked on the lake shore so the divers could study it 
before taking to the murky water 
comanche county undersheriff john stowe said the helicopter was 
in about 15 feet of water authorities thought the missing crewman 
might be inside the helicopter stowe said 
the use of night vision goggles which electronically enhance 
moonlight has come under fire in recent years because some pilots 
say they limit peripheral vision and cause other problems the army 
says it has improved the goggles after they were blamed for a 1988 
crash at fort campbell ky that killed 17 soldiers 
the helicopter was part of 374th air ambulance company based in 
little rock ark pope said the lake is about 15 miles north of 
the army post 
the medical evacuation company had been activated for operation 
desert shield in the persian gulf and had arrived at fort sill 
earlier this month 
after lake residents rescued the five crew members authorities 
later ordered all boats out of the water so helicopters using 
searchlights could fly low to look for the missing crew member 
the cause of the crash was under investigation 
shoreline residents reported hearing an explosion before the 
crash barbara and kevin mccray went outside to investigate 
we could hear them moaning in the water said mccray who 
joined a neighbor on his boat to rescue the five crew members 
if one of those guys hadnt had a little blue beacon light we 
wouldnt have found them mccray said there were pieces of 
helicopter scattered all over the water 
the five were wrapped around the rotor and they said one 
hadnt come up he said 
first i started to panic spec mike pierce said later 
wrapped in a blanket in a shoreside home then i thought stay 
calm and i reached for my seat belt and floated out

a rare form of the aids virus could slip into the 
nations blood supply but officials at the federal centers for 
disease control said friday that it wasnt worth the cost to try to 
detect it 
only 18 known cases of the virus known as hiv2 exist in the 
united states tests for the more common aids virus hiv1 will 
usually but not always detect the rarer strain predominantly 
found in west africa 
a cdc study of more than 25000 blood samples detected no blood 
donors with hiv2 infection it would cost more than 60 million a 
year to test every blood donor for hiv2 and the cdc concluded 
that it wasnt worth it 
dr lyle peterson an epidemiologist at the atlantabased cdc 
who led the study said researchers chose 25000 blood samples from 
the american red cross and new york blood center which provide 
more than 50 percent of the nations blood supply 
currently blood centers conduct two tests for hiv1 an enzyme 
immuniassay eia and western blot positive results from one test 
mean the blood is not transfused 
peterson said researchers have discovered that hiv2 carriers 
are likely to test positive on the eia and negative on the western 
blot so the study only used eiapositive samples but when these 
highrisk samples were tested solely for hiv2 that strain of the 
virus did not appear 
these samples represent over 12 million donations so were 
pretty confident there isnt any hiv2 in the blood supply 
peterson said generally 60 to 90 percent of the time hiv2 
carriers will have a positive hiv1 test 
the cdc believes there is only one hiv2 carrier to have donated 
blood in the united states the woman who was not identified had 
traveled to west africa and donated blood in 1986 before the hiv2 
surveillance project began 
but because her blood tested positive for hiv1 it was not 
transfused 
the cdc has biographical information on 15 of the 18 hiv2 
infected people in the united states all of those either had 
immigrated from or traveled to west africa recently or had had 
sexual contact with west africans 
because of the hiv2 risk people who have moved to the united 
states from west africa since 1977 are excluded from donating 
blood and officials routinely question potential donors about 
their contact with west africans 
peterson said the cdc is continuing the study and will report to 
the us food and drug administration which would decide whether 
hiv2 tests become necessary

many of americas hospitals and nursing homes 
are welcoming a new medical miranda warning that gives patients 
their legal options for refusing or accepting treatment if they are 
incapacitated 
if the issue is dealt with up front it certainly makes things 
easier when crisis situations occur said janet riley a 
spokeswoman for the american health care association which 
represents 10000 nursing homes 
the legislation was tucked away in the deficitcutting package 
approved in the congressional rush to adjourn and quietly became 
law with president bushs signature earlier this month 
it stemmed in part from the missouri case of nancy cruzan a 
woman who has been in a comalike state since a 1983 car accident 
the supreme court in its first righttodie ruling rejected a 
request by ms cruzans parents to remove a tube sustaining her 
with food and water the court said the cruzans didnt have clear 
and convincing evidence that their daughter would want to be 
allowed to die 
advocates hope the law will help families avoid lengthy lawsuits 
to end unwanted lifeprolonging treatment 
the law effective in november 1991 applies to hospitals 
hospices nursing homes health maintenance organizations and other 
health care facilities that receive money from medicare and 
medicaid programs 
it will supporters say help inform patients of their medical 
care rights much in the same way police advise people of their 
legal rights in criminal matters through a miranda warning at 
the time of arrest 
for the first time adult patients will be provided with the 
knowledge of their legal rights to make decisions about their 
care said sen john danforth rmo 
under the law patients must receive written information 
explaining their righttodie options under their state laws 
for example a person checking into a hospital would be told 
about advance directives such as a living will which spells 
out a persons wishes for treatment another possibility is a 
durable power of attorney which designates someone else to make 
medical decisions if an individual is unable to do so 
hospitals and other providers must note on medical records 
whether patients have legal directives on treatment providers also 
must have procedures to ensure they comply with a patients wishes 
in accordance with state law 
the law requires the department of health and human services to 
conduct a nationwide campaign to educate people about righttodie 
legal options 
the most important aspect of the law in my mind is not 
necessarily what its requiring hospitals to do but that there 
is a public educational effort said frederick j entin general 
counsel for the american hospital association 
danforth who introduced the legislation with sen daniel 
patrick moynihan dny has complained the health care and 
legal systems do a terrible job of telling patients about care in 
hopeless situations 
but thomas marzen general counsel for the national legal center 
for the medically dependent and disabled was critical of the 
legislation 
it could become a program of persuasion for a lot of people to 
decline medical treatment even if its not particularly burdensome 
and might be necessary he said 
the law particularly for the disabled could act as another 
nail in the coffin trying to get them because they are deemed to 
have a low quality of life not to live marzen said 
advocates say the law creates no new federal rights 
this isnt a bill that says you must refuse treatment said 
fenella rouse executive director of the society for the right to 
dieconcern for dying it is a bill that says youre free to make 
your own choices

foreign secretary douglas hurd said today that the 
un security council may meet next week to consider a draft 
resolution authorizing the use of force against iraq in the persian 
gulf crisis 
hurd met earlier this week on the sidelines of an international 
summit in paris with us secretary of state james baker iii to 
discuss the proposed resolution which would authorize an attack to 
drive iraq from kuwait 
the united states lobbied extensively with its allies to garner 
support for the resolution and maintain the international coalition 
that has formed against iraqi president saddam hussein 
several leaders speculated in paris that the meeting at the 
united nations would take place in december but hurds comments 
were the first indication that enough support had been gathered to 
call the meeting as early as the end of this month 
the united states holds the chairmanship of the council but it 
is rotated and passes to yemen in december yemen the only arab 
nation on the council has refused to endorse the proposed 
resolution 
the united states has led the campaign to win international 
support and baker visited yemen on thursday 
both sides said no decision had been reached but president gen 
ali abdullah saleh standing next to baker criticized the military 
buildup in the region and called for an arab solution to the 
crisis 
in cairo today president bush told reporters the world is 
getting tired of iraqs continuing occupation of kuwait and said 
he was closing in on an agreement for the proposed resolution 
speaking at the launching of his campaign for leader of 
britains conservative party and prime minister hurd said the gulf 
crisis weighs on my mind among the issues more heavily than 
anything else at the present time 
hurd said he hoped that passage of the proposed resolution would 
be the latest of the peaceful pressures on saddam hussein to get 
him to withdraw 
i dont know whether those peaceful pressures will work and 
that is why i fear the crisis is entering a crucial critical phase 
and in the next weeks and months we will be in that phase he 
said

the number of pine trees 
in yosemite park damaged by ozone has increased more than fivefold 
in the last five years according to a new study 
the report released this week says 297 percent of yosemites 
pines now show mottling caused by damage from ozone a colorless 
odorless gas produced by auto and industrial emissions a similar 
study in 1985 found 57 percent of the trees had suffered damage 
the national park service reported 
officials at yosemite which celebrated its 100th birthday as a 
national park oct 1 said they need to study the 1990 findings 
before they can comment on ways to alleviate the problem but a 
decadeold master plan for the park in the central sierra nevada 
calls for eventually abolishing vehicle traffic by tourists into 
yosemite valley their prime destination 
no timetable has been announced for the plan to force tourists 
to switch to trams or buses and leave their cars above yosemite 
valley 
but national park service director james ridenour has promised 
that park maintenance facilities will be moved out of the valley 
perhaps starting as early as the 1992 fiscal year 
the effects of ozone in the sierra nevada first were noticed in 
the 1970s at sequoia national park 100 miles south of yosemite and 
less than 150 miles north of los angeles the park service has 
commissioned research to determine if ozone affects giant sequoias 
as it does pine trees 
diane ewell sequoias air quality specialist says officials 
may start a system to warn visitors when the parks ozone is high 
much like the alerts in smogbound cities such as los angeles

confederate money and weapons were nearly 
worthless when sherman attacked atlanta in 1864 but time and 
television have been kind to the confederacy which is now a hot 
spot in the memorabilia market 
we won out anyway said dent myers owner of wildmans civil 
war surplus in kennesaw and a descendant of a rebel soldier all 
the confederate stuff is worth more now than union stuff 
prompted in part by the public broadcasting service documentary 
the civil war more and more people are out to buy souvenirs 
and demand is creating ever higher prices for authentic objects 
theres been an unbelievable increase in sales said lori 
nash an employee at stone mountain relics everybody says i 
want a gun like in that movie 
in some cases collectors are paying up to 4000 for rifles and 
as much as 2000 for certain confederate belt buckles musket 
balls and bullets however are still the cheapest items sometimes 
going for as little as 2 each 
by comparison john marcinkowski spent 24000 for a oneton 
piece of history that rests in his fathers basement 
it just makes me happy marcinkowski a vietnam veteran who 
lives in marietta said of his recent purchase of a pennsylvania

people marched on busy streets chanting destroy the rituals no

which mandates the separation of religion and state and defines the 
emperor as a national symbol

was used by militarists to rally support for japanese aggression in 
world war ii

the emperors enthronement rituals warned yosuke sugi a leader 
of the ultraleftist chukakuha group

the dispatch of japans military overseas as part of international 
peacekeeping efforts

controversial rite in his accession to the chrysanthemum throne in

the centers for disease control announced a new 
program friday that the agency hopes will help doctors hear about 
outbreaks of potentially fatal respiratory viruses sooner 
the cdc is monitoring respiratory syncytial rsv and 
parainfluenza viruses which cause a variety of often serious 
respiratory ailments especially in young children 
previously health officials had alerted the cdc of outbreaks by 
weekly postcards now they will report the viruses by telephone 
enabling the cdc to post the results on the national public health 
network weekly 
cdc epidemiologist james alexander said the timeliness will help 
doctors and public health officials hear of outbreaks sooner thus 
cutting down on the number of diagnostic tests ill children undergo 
and possibly helping doctors prevent spread of the virus 
the study shows that rsv is most often found in january rsv 
causes kinds of bronchial illnesses that can be fatal to infants or 
sickly children and it hits almost every child by age 2 
the cdc found that the two least serious types of parainfluenza 
known as types 1 and 2 and which cause colds and croup usually 
cause outbreaks every other fall especially in november 
parainfluenza type 3 is more serious and causes types of 
bronchitis and pneumonia in infants and the elderly which can be 
fatal it is found yearround but the cdc study indicates it peaks 
in spring

at least 30 states face budget deficits because of 
the rising cost of services falling tax revenues and slackening 
consumer spending according to surveys 
the deficits range from 42 million in tennessee to 1 billion 
in new york according to studies by the national association of 
state budget officers and the boston globe 
its unusual to have this many states in trouble when were 
really just going into a recession said jerry miller head of 
the state budget group the last time things were this bad in 
198283 we were already in a recession 
the surveys concluded that the faltering economy has dampened 
business output leading to a falloff in revenues from state 
business taxes 
corporate taxes are the most volatile and have fallen the 
greatest said george leung head of state ratings at moodys 
investors service 
leung said consumers have been buying less leading to a dro in 
sales tax collections 
studies show consumer confidence has dropped to record lows 
he said 
the less consumers spend the more businesses are likely to lay 
off workers state governments also have trimmed their payrolls 
including massachusetts where up to 10000 part and fulltime 
state jobs have been eliminated over the past two years 
the surveys found that job losses by both public and private 
employers are adding to state spending as unemployed workers sign 
up for state benefits and more families join the welfare rolls 
such layoffs have also depressed states third major source of 
revenue personal income taxes 
indications of economic hard times were papered over in some 
states to shield officeholders running for reelection said hal 
hovey editor of state budget and tax news 
hovey said that in maine for example state officials falsely 
reassured voters that depressed revenues would increase after the 
election 
similarly michigan budget officials predicted spending on 
medicaid would drop hovey said when everyone else expects it to 
go up 10 to 20 percent 
miller agreed that a number of states were not totally candid 
until after the election 
the federal government last year began requiring states to pay 
for expanded coverage for victims of catastrophic illness nursing 
home residents and pregnant women 
just the new mandates in medicaid cost more than the total 
revenue growth in a number of states including new york rhode 
island and massachusetts said miller 
even many states where budgets remain in balance are worried 
this year were right on target but its looking like we may 
have slowed revenue growth so things will be pretty tight next 
year said john gasparith new mexicos budget director 
these are the 30 states listed by the surveys which did not 
provide complete deficit figures 
alabama arizona california colorado connecticut delaware 
florida georgia illinois indiana iowa maine maryland 
massachusetts michigan minnesota mississippi missouri new 
hampshire new jersey new york north carolina ohio

president bush today sought to solidify the arab 
coalition against iraqs saddam hussein getting fresh assurances 
from egyptian president hosni mubarak and then flying here to 
consult with syrias hafez assad 
assads syrian arab airlines boing 747 touched down three hours 
before air force one speaking through an interpreter assad told 
reporters we have the hope there will be between us convergent 
viewpoints 
bush and assad planned two hours of talks the session has 
proved controversial because syria is on a state department list of 
countries that sponsor terrorism 
at a photo session with bush before the meetin assad shrugged 
off a question about whether syrian forces would join any military 
offense against iraq do you think at such a large press 
conference that we speak about offensive or defensive operations 
he said 
bush tightlipped and largely unsmiling as he joined assad 
refused to answer reporters questions the two leaders sat in 
chairs some distance apart 
before leaving cairo egypt bush declared that the world is 
getting tired of iraqs continuing occupation of kuwait and said 
he was closing in on agreement for a un resolution authorizing 
the use of force in the persian gulf crisis 
i think were very very close now said bush fresh from a 
thanksgiving day visit with us troops in the persian gulf 
in new york soviet ambassador to the united nations yuliy m 
vorontsov said the un security council will meet next week with 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze attending secretary of 
state james a baker iii will also be in new york next week 
vorontsov said the meeting will discuss iraqi aggression and to 
issue a strong serious and precise warning to baghdad 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd said friday that the 
council may meet next week to consider a draft resolution 
authorizing the use of force 
geneva was the final stop of bushs weeklong overseas journey 
it also was the site of his controversial meeting with assad whose 
nation is on a state department list of nations that sponsor 
terrorism 
bush defended his decision to meet with assad whom he said is 
lined up with us for a commitment to force 
he said the international coalition demanding iraqs withdrawal 
from kuwait will not rest until saddam pulls his forces out 
socalled partial solutions are out of the question he said 
mubaraks declarations sounded identical the iraqi invasion 
must be reversed and kuwait must be liberated the egyptian 
leader said for both of us its a matter of principles and moral 
courage 
at the same time mubarak used the news conference to call for 
an overall settlement to intractable arabisraeli disagreements he 
urged a greater international effort to deal with the plight of 
the palestinian people he added the holy shrines of jerusalem 
must be respected and protected 
bush said the united states is eager for an overall middle 
eastern peace agreement but he swiftly added what i am equally 
determined to do is to keep these two questions separate there is 
no linkage to the kuwaiti occupation he said 
the united states currently has an estimated 230000 troops in 
the persian gulf region and another 200000 or more are on their 
way 
bush spoke with reporters as congressional leaders returning 
from saudi arabia said the president would have a far better chance 
of getting house and senate support for the use of force if the 
united nations first backed such a move 
it would have some significant impact if the united nations 
granted such a resolution said house speaker thomas foley 
senate majority leader george mitchell said a un resolution would 
improve bushs chances but not necessarily guarantee congressional 
approval if the president sought it 
senate gop leader bob dole said he would urge congress to 
reconvene immediately if the united nations endorsed force to free 
kuwait from iraqi occupation then i would hope congress would 
reconvene and take similar action dole said 
bushs authority has been challenged by 45 house democrats who 
filed a suit in federal court earlier this month seeking to bar him 
from ordering an attack without congressional approval 
bush whose voyage took him to a 34nation european summit 
conference as well as to the middle east is mounting an energetic 
diplomatic campaign to round up support for a un security council 
resolution permitting the use of force to dislodge saddams army 
from kuwait 
secretary of state james a baker iii traveled to yemen on 
thursday as part of that effort but was rebuffed yemen sits on 
the security council and will take over the rotating chairmanship 
from the united states at the end of the month baker is headed for 
colombia on saturday for additional meetings with another security 
council member 
bush when asked about the status of a un resolution said he 
believes he has the authority necessary to act without united 
nations concurrence he added however i am confident that we 
will be successful in the security council the world is getting 
tired of this and the security council is tired of the fact that 
earlier resolutions have been ignored 
but were going to keep working on it and i think were very 
very close now he said 
bush also defended his decision to meet with syrias president 
brushing aside a question of whether he was rewarding terrorism by 
meeting with the leader of a nation that is on the state department 
roster of nations that sponsor terrorism 
theyre on the front line of standing up to saddam bush 
said he quickly added that doesnt mean we have no differences 
with syria and said he would be discussing those subjects with 
assad mr assad is lined up with us for a commitment to force 
bush said 
bushs day trip to three continents he was ending up at camp 
david md marked the end of an overseas journey that seemed to 
span two eras he began his trip in europe where he participated 
in signing ceremonies for a treaty to cut conventional forces in 
europe and attended a conference that symbolically buried the cold 
war 
the emotional highpoint of the trip was the holiday spent 
visiting us and british forces in the persian gulf 
we wont pull punches bush promised troops in saudi arabia 
bush was in high spirits thursday after hopscotching by 
helicopter across eastern saudi arabia to spend thanksgiving with 
troops who someday may be ordered to war to drive iraq out of 
kuwait 
the president accompanied by his wife barbara came within 65 
miles of the border with kuwait stopping at an encampment for us 
marines bush called it an unforgettable experience 
it was a scene of endless desert marked only by clumps of 
camouflage netting that concealed combat vehicles and other 
equipment altogether the president saw about 5000 to 6000 of 
the 230000 american troops in the persian gulf 
we are not here on some exercise bush said and were not 
walking away until our mission is done until the invader is out of 
kuwait

president mikhail s gorbachev warned today that a 
breakup of the soviet union could lead to bloodshed and civil 
conflict and said he would use all his constitutional powers to 
prevent it 
we will not be able to divide when such attempts have been 
made the results were bloodshed and grave consequences 
gorbachev said in a news conference 
he spoke hours after the supreme soviet legislature for the 
second time in a week endorsed his plans to reorganize the 
presidential branch of government and gave him two weeks to take 
radical steps to boost the food supply 
gorbachev offered few details on his proposals to improve the 
food situation other than saying he had secured promises of 
western aid and planned to suggest changes in laws covering 
agriculture and landholding 
he said the latest draft of a proposed union treaty would be 
published saturday the treaty is designed as a new charter binding 
the 15 soviet republics all but one of have declared some form of 
sovereignty and the three baltic republics have declared 
independence 
gorbachev said that those republics wishing to leave the union 
must hold a referendum as required by soviet law and that as 
president he would oppose any other form of dissolution of the 
union 
if someone tried to impose such a policy it would result in 
bloodshed and civil conflict which would be unacceptable to the 
world community he said 
asked to specify what steps he would take to prevent a republic 
from leaving the union gorbachev said we will stay within the 
constitution 
it is a whole divorce procedure he said referring to the 
law requiring a referendum in any republic wishing to secede 
in this way it will be bloodless

a welfare recipient turned banker a selfmade 
millionaire and an old etonian began the battle on friday to 
succeed prime minister margaret thatcher 
all promised to be less combative than mrs thatcher toward 
europe just as tough toward iraq and willing to do something about 
her unpopular local services tax heralding a fiveday campaign 
that seemed more about a prize than a battle over policy 
we can only get ourselves out of the mess by rallying 
everybody by healing the wounds said one candidate foreign 
secretary douglas hurd 
hurd and chancellor of the exchequer john major joined the race 
friday they must stop former defense secretary michael heseltine 
whose strong showing in the first round of voting tuesday provoked 
mrs thatchers resignation 
she spent the day in her office at 10 downing street running 
the country her son mark said mrs thatcher gave no hint of 
which candidate she favored although it certainly wasnt 
heseltine 
major 47 left school at 16 and worked his way up from laborer 
and welfare recipient to banker and then went into politics he is 
regarded as on the right of the party and therefore closest 
politically to mrs thatcher 
hurd 60 was educated at the upperclass preparatory school 
eton and oxford and generally more liberal in tory terms 
heseltine 57 also oxfordeducated is a selfmade millionaire 
who resigned from the cabinet in 1986 after a sharp disagreement 
with mrs thatcher about the sale of a british defense contractor 
mrs thatcher decided to quit thursday after cabinet ministers 
and her campaign manager told her she would lose to heseltine in 
the second ballot next tuesday 
the vote among the 372 conservative members of parliament will 
go to a third and final ballot next thursday if no one gets a 
simple majority of 187 or more on tuesday 
hurd and major pledged at their campaign kickoffs to review the 
nation socalled poll tax an unpopular per capita local 
government tax imposed regardless of income and regarded as a major 
political blunder of the thatcher era 
i do become increasingly convinced that we cannot leave things 
as they are major said 
heseltine declared that an immediate and fundamental review of 
the tax is essential for our survival 
hurd and major who support mrs thatchers rejection of a 
single currency for the european community each promised in the 
closest to open criticism of her so far to adopt a markedly 
different tone in europe and in cabinet meetings 
i think that cabinet government consists of listening 
deciding persuading voters in that order hurd said you 
listen to views you take a decision in our case collectively in 
cabinet 
hurd maintained hed be the best prime minister for the persian 
gulf crisis 
mrs thatcher has been the most enthusiastic western supporter 
of the us troop buildup in the region her cabinet decided 
wednesday to send 14000 more troops to the gulf bringing the 
british total to 30000 
the crisis is entering a crucial critical phase and will 
require cool and authoritative handling hurd said 
on the poll tax issue heseltine has the advantage of having 
left the cabinet before it was imposed 
however he is regarded as something of a maverick who does not 
fit wholly into the partys left or right and he has stirred deep 
anger among some thatcher loyalists for bringing her down 
its not been a pleasant thing to do heseltine said but 
now that it has happened the mood of unity has overwhelmed the 
party 
david robertson a fellow in politics at oxford university said 
the reluctance by hurd heseltine and major to adopt markedly 
different policy platforms reflected the old american political 
notion of a balanced ticket 
all three of the current candidates rather than advancing 
serious general ideologies are doing their damndest to hide 
them robertson said in a bbc radio interview he predicted the 
party was returning to pragmatism a sort of nonism after 
nearly 12 years of thatcherism 
mrs thatcher spent part of friday on the telephone talking to 
foreign leaders calling to say goodbye and good luck to the western 
worlds longestserving head of government 
her husband denis and 35yearold twins mark and carol 
thatcher spent part of the day with her 
shes doing what she always does on a friday running the 
country mark thatcher an auto executive who lives in dallas 
texas told reporters after visiting his mother 
bookmakers made major and heseltine nearequal favorites to win 
a market and opinion and research international poll for the 
times of london suggested the tories who have lagged in opinion 
polls for 16 months would defeat the opposition labor party under 
heseltine or major but lose under hurd

a study has found that 6 percent of young 
children treated at a detroit hospital had cocaine in their 
systems fueling concern that secondhand drug smoke harms infants 
officials say 
dr norman rosenberg chief of emergency medical services at 
childrens hospital of michigan said his findings may be the first 
effort to determine the rate of childrens exposure to smoke from 
crack the highly addictive smokable form of cocaine 
nothing official has ever been published he said 
everyone i have talked to says it evidence of exposure is 
extraordinarily high 
since october 1989 evidence of cocaine exposure has been found 
in the urine of about 6 percent of 360 children treated in the 
hospitals emergency room an additional 120 samples have yet to be 
analyzed 
the study includes children from 1 month to 5 years old who were 
taken to the hospital with nonlifethreatening ailments none had 
been breastfed and any cocaine from exposure in the womb would 
have dissipated from their blood by the time they were 1 month old 
rosenberg said youngsters who tested positive had to have been 
exposed to crack smoke within three days because cocaine passes 
through the body within 72 hours 
children were excluded from the study if they had symptoms such 
as seizures hypertension and rapid pulse which suggest they may 
have eaten the drug rosenberg said 
its a very sad commentary for the quality of life for 
children in this state said c patrick babcock director of the 
michigan department of social services every day there is a new 
phenomenon because crack is so widespread and such a cheap high 
elizabeth rahdert a research psychologist at the national 
institute on drug abuse said rosenbergs results seem clinically 
significant she said the finding is disturbing because it may only 
reflect the tip of the iceberg since crack addicts may be less 
likely to seek medical care for their children 
doctors in several us cities have reported that babies exposed 
to crack smoke had seizures were abnormally drowsy or couldnt 
stand up 
a 1989 study published in the american journal of diseases of 
children examined the cases of four children from 3 months to 4 
years old in new york citys harlem section who were heavily 
exposed to crack smoke each had symptoms of drowsiness and 
unsteady gait or seizures

president bush said friday he was confident the un security 
council would authorize the use of force against iraq and 
britains foreign secretary said the council probably would meet 
next week to take up the matter 
iraq underscoring its readiness to fight to keep kuwait began 
calling up battlehardened military reservists on friday it also 
lifted a curfew in the conquered emirate insisting normal life 
is resuming and implying that the kuwaiti resistance has been 
beaten down 
the united states made an urgent appeal to its nato allies 
to help ferry us soldiers and equipment to the persian gulf 
region officials said 
there are about 230000 american troops in the gulf region now 
200000 more are to arrive in coming weeks 
word that the security council would convene soon to consider 
the useofforce measure came from douglas hurd britains foreign 
secretary 
soon probably next week the security council will consider a 
draft resolution authorizing member states to use force to bring 
about the reversal of the iraqi aggression he told reporters in 
london 
iraq overran kuwait aug 2 in a dispute over land money and 
oil 
the soviet ambassador to the united nations also said the 
security council would meet next week to discuss iraqi aggression 
but did not specify whether the resolution authorizing force would 
be discussed but the envoy yuliy m vorontsov said soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze would attend the session 
shevardnadze held talks friday with his chinese counterpart 
qian qichen in the chinese city of urumqi both china and the 
soviet union have urged iraq to get out of kuwait but both have 
stressed the need for a peaceful solution 
hurds comment was the first indication that enough support for 
the useofforce measure had been gathered to call the meeting 
before the end of the month 
the urgency is due in large part to the fact that yemen which 
has tilted toward iraq in the past takes over the rotating 
chairmanship of the security council from the united states in 
december 
secretary of state james a baker iii was in the small red sea 
nation on thursday seeking support for the resolution but failed 
to get it yemen is the only arab state on the security council 
baker will continue his intensive lobbying effort on the measure 
during the weekend he is to meet saturday with senior officials in 
colombia and hold talks in los angeles with officials from 
malaysia both are security council members 
bush too has been working hard to build support for the 
resolution he conferred friday in cairo with president hosni 
mubarak of egypt which has been a chief arab ally in the antiiraq 
coalition 
afterward bush said i am confident that we will be 
successful in the security council 
later bush arrived in geneva switzerland for talks with 
syrian president hafez assad some congressional leaders have 
expressed concern about the meeting because syria is on a state 
department list of countries that sponsor terrorism 
but bush defended his dealings with assad saying the syrian 
president is lined up with us for a commitment to force before 
the meeting assad declined to tell reporters whether syria would 
participate in any military offensive against iraq 
the us pitch for help from north atlantic treaty organization 
members in ferrying troops to the gulf was made by nato envoy 
william h taft iv at the brussels headquarters of the alliance 
officials said 
european allies have already provided some trooptransport 
assistance but the ew request centered on the need for passenger 
planes said a us official at the nato mission speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the latest iraqi callup announced in a defense ministry 
communique broadcast on baghdad radio involves reservists in their 
30s including battletested veterans of the 198088 iraniraq war 
they apparently will be among 150000 reservists and draftees 
that iraq said earlier this week would be sent to kuwait along 
with about 100000 other regular army troops 
also friday iraqs official news agency said it was canceling 
an overnight curfew in kuwait because the emirate is calmer now 
the news agency monitored in nicosia cyprus said the move was 
meant to confirm the return of normal life to kuwait which 
iraq has declared to be an iraqi province 
in other developments 
western european lawmakers warned in a report that the 
multinational force in the gulf region risks dangerous mixups if 
coordination is not improved it said procedures for identifying 
the nationality of warships and planes must be modified to assure 
the safety of friendly forces the report is to be discussed next 
month by representatives of the west european union the european 
arm of nato 
iraqi authorities rounded up five british men who had been in 
hiding in kuwait since the iraqi invasion britains foreign office 
said friday the government estimates that 750 british citizens 
remain in iraq about 300 of whom are being detained a key military 
sites less than 600 britons remain in kuwait about 60 of whom are 
being detained

the soviet kgb has stepped up its espionage 
activities in germany despite the new era of eastwest friendship 
a spokesman for bonns counterintelligence agency said friday 
while political leaders hail the cold wars end soviet spies 
continue to search for german defense secrets desperately needed 
technological knowhow and political information 
its cheaper to use the help of a spy agency to get the 
knowhow than to buy it said hansgert lange spokesman for the 
german counterintelligence agency 
about 400 soviet spies are working in former east berlin 
according to one leading newspaper 
in years past communist east germany employed up to 8000 spies 
to keep tabs on west germany and then passed on the information to 
its warsaw pact allies in moscow 
that changed after the peaceful revolution in east germany a 
year ago led to the unification with nato member west germany 
the intensification is due to the fact that they the soviets 
have to do more on account of the information deficit and they are 
doing it lange said 
he is the spokesman for the constitutional protection office 
the government branch in charge of fighting foreign espionage 
agents 
lange said the political upheaval that shook east germany made 
the kremlin even more eager to get intelligence information 
more soviet agents are slipping into germany lange said 
although he did not have a specific number of kgb spies operating 
in the unified nation 
lange said the soviets are trying to recruit former east german 
agents 
there has always been spying and there always will be 
spying he added 
by law the spies should be rounded up and prosecuted but the 
berliner morgenpost newspaper said german authorities for the most 
part are reluctant to make arrests because of the improved ties 
with the soviet union 
the newspaper said at least 400 kgb agents were still operating 
in what used to be east berlin the paper said the information came 
from former east german secret police agents cooperating with 
german authorities since unificaiton on oct 3 
german officials are hoping the soviets will withdraw their 
spies on their own initiative the paper said 
the nov 5 arrest of a kgb major in potsdam near berlin was a 
warning signal to the soviets the paper added 
a government spokesman said friday night he had not read the 
article and therefore could not comment directly on it but the 
official speaking on condition of anonymity said spies would be 
arrested if caught regardless of which country they worked 
for

a senior colombian judicial official 
said friday the government wanted to clear the way for drug 
traffickers to surrender peacefully 
the traffickers have proposed that hundreds of them gather to 
surrender in a heavily fortified compound protected by the army 
the judicial official carlos mejia appeared to endorse the idea 
in a radio interview friday 
we would guarantee the personal security of these persons as 
well as protect their legal rights giving them decent and 
dignified treatment said mejia national director of colombias 
criminal court division 
the drug smugglers have not said if the offer to surrender 
applied to pablo escobar the medellin cartels leader escobar 
colombias most wanted man remains at large despite a government 
offer to pay 500000 for information leading to his capture dead 
or alive 
the surrender offer came in a statement given to president cesar 
gaviria by a group of church leaders who have been negotiating the 
release of nine journalists being held hostage by the cartel the 
presidents office released the statement late thursday 
in exchange for giving themselves up the druglords demanded 
guarantees of safety and a promise not to send them to the united 
states on friday the traffickers declared a unilateral ceasefire 
in their terrorist attacks their third such truce this year 
thursdays statement said between 200 and 300 cocaine smugglers 
would be willing to surrender in a compound protected by the army 
and police 
the statement did not mention the fate of the journalists but 
the medellin cartel issued a communique friday saying the 
journalists will be released as long as our human rights and 
those of our families are respected 
earlier the cartel said it kidnapped the journalists because 
police were torturing and killing trafficking suspects in medellin 
colombias secondlargest city 
in fridays statement the cartel said it was declaring a 
ceasefire so that the people can go to the polls freely in a 
national election next month voters will elect a national assembly 
to reform the countrys constitution 
the medellin cartel has been blamed for killing about 550 
colombians since the government and traffickers declared war on 
each other after a political assassination in august 1989 the 
traffickers offer to surrender raised hopes that the drug war 
would end soon 
justice minister jaime giraldo on thursday outlined guarantees 
for cocaine smugglers who surrender in a letter to the criminal 
court division he said traffickers would be kept in clean 
wellguarded facilities 
giraldo said surrendering traffickers can be sure they will 
not be extradited 
many of the cartels killings have been to protest extraditions 
to the united states in statements to the media the cartel refers 
to itself as the extraditables 
in september gaviria had offered to ban extraditions and reduce 
jail sentences of cocaine traffickers who surrendered and 
confessed 
the traffickers said they would expect upon surrendering that 
their treatment be monitored by international human rights 
organizations in thursdays statement they said they do not 
deserve to be treated like common criminals

two counselors who set out to get revenge 
against two autistic men after a scuffle were accused of beating 
and burning them with cigarettes police said 
its pathetic when you think that people who are put in charge 
of these people would assault them in any way said detective 
michael fiori 
arrest warrants were issued wednesday for charles blakney 26 
and marvin hill 33 for investigation of the burning and beatings 
on friday the two denver men had not been arrested fiori said 
blakney and hill were counselors for the denver board for the 
developmentally disabled and make up part of the victims 
roundtheclock care 
on oct 3 fiori said a 32yearold autistic man became 
distraught and began destroying his apartment which he shares with 
the other victim at some point in the disturbance he slapped a 
counselor with an open hand 
thats what caused the counselor to decide he was going to get 
revenge fiori said 
a day and a half later the counselors allegedly assaulted him 
fiori said 
one of the assailants told another counselor that they hit him 
about the stomach and chest area so as not to show any bruises 
fiori said 
one victim was also burned with a cigarette on his forearm 
fiori said this had been confirmed by a doctor there was one 
other client out there who was also burned with a cigarette on his 
stomach 
blakney and hill who are black were placed on leave when the 
assaults came to light in late october they have since filed 
complaints with the national association for the advancement of 
colored people fiori said the complaints say the move to place 
them on leave was racially motivated he said 
neither victim is able to help in the prosecution but there was 
a witness to one of the assaults and evidence in both cases fiori 
said 
i dont have any comment on the personnel issue said gene 
van blaricom acting executive director of the board 
because of confidentiality laws he said he was unable to 
comment on the discrimination complaint

an artists sales of inexpensive 
jewelry in the shape of houses have raised nearly 300000 to 
benefit the homeless in 38 states 
the jewelry designed by lucinda l yates is available from 
retail stores and nonprofit groups under an agreement with her 
all of the outlets donate 40 percent of the 10 price to community 
shelters 
ms yates who previously created highfashion jewelry said she 
devised the idea for house pins after failing to find volunteer 
work in the community 
i wanted to get involved in some capacity other than working 
in a soup kitchen and here i was offering my services but i was 
getting little or no response she said 
the colorful cardboard brooches caught the imagination of local 
residents and when the president of the womens council of 
realtors in portland took some of the pins to its national 
convention in florida sales started to spread to other states 
the business gained wider attention when other national groups 
including foundations and a college sorority joined the cause 
when i wear a house pin i get stopped by people in the 
streets wanting to know where i got it said sister eileen 
reilly of st marys catholic church in richmond va 
so far 80000 pins each one slightly different have been 
sold in the past three weeks the company ms yates created to 
manufacture the brooches has been getting 1000 new orders a day 
she said 
ms yates her family and several friends make the pins at her 
south portland office she also employs several homebased workers 
for a total work force of 25 people 
the 35yearold portland native said she is just as surprised as 
anyone at the popularity of her pins 
pretty soon well have to have 18wheelers come in here to 
pick up all the orders she said

germany on friday rejected us claims that 
the soviet union has sufficient food supplies this year and said 
it will send experts to moscow next week to try to resolve 
distribution problems 
there have been dire predictions of what the winter holds in 
store for the soviet people and fears that food shortages could 
worsen longstanding tensions and lead to widespread civil unrest 
in a meeting with reporters friday government spokesman dieter 
vogel underscored bonns view that food shipments and other aid to 
moscow this year were absolutely essential 
according to our knowledge delivery of foodstuffs is 
unfortunately necessary because although there was an average a 
reasonably good harvest in the soviet union the logistics there 
contain so many complications that the supply is obviously 
insufficient vogel said 
us officials in washington say there is no evidence of 
widespread hunger in the soviet union one of the worlds biggest 
grain growers and that a food aid program shouldnt be necessary 
this year 
clearly its mostly a political consideration not a 
nutritional or an economic consideration one us source said on 
condition of anonymity the germans offering food aid put some 
pressure on the rest of us to show the same kind of concern but 
its exasperating because its their the soviets problem to 
solve and theyre not taking the necessary steps 
vogel noted that the soviets have always said their biggest 
problem was getting the goods to their people 
hundreds of german trains bound for the soviet union are stuck 
at the germanpolish and polishsoviet borders because the soviets 
are unable to unload the goods and ship them to their destination 
a team of german foreign ministry economic agricultural and 
transportation officials under the leadership of horst teltschick 
chancellor helmut kohls top aide will be in moscow on tuesday and 
wednesday for talks on the matter vogel said 
kohl told parliament the group would meet with president mikhail 
s gorbachev and other soviet officials 
bonn has already promised 195 billion in various forms of aid 
to the soviet union berliners have said they want to send 
stockpiles they kept during the cold war in the event of a soviet 
invasion to help their former enemies 
vogel said the delegation would discuss the berlin stockpiles 
but that how much could be sent would be left to the bonn 
ministries to decide 
kohl has made help for the soviet union a major theme in recent 
speeches and meetings with world leaders particularly at this 
weeks 34nation summit on security in europe his argument is that 
only with a stable soviet union can the old east bloc continue with 
its reforms

roman catholic archbishop rembert weakland 
censured by the vatican for studying womens reasons for having 
abortions said friday his critics wont silence his views 
i cant imagine being stopped unless you take out my 
tongue he told reporters as he broke into laughter at a news 
conference marking his return from a trip to el salvador i must 
admit i may be too upbeat about it maybe thats not good 
when asked about the vaticans decision last month to bar a 
swiss university from giving him an honorary doctorate he said 
i havent taken it that seriously 
the vaticans congregation of education in october ordered the 
university of fribourg to remove weaklands name from a list of 
recipients for honorary degrees scheduled to be awarded this week 
the university had sought to honor weakland for his work in 
writing a 1986 us bishops letter on the economy and social 
justice after the vaticans order it canceled the awards ceremony 
rather than exclude weakland 
in the letter to fribourg the vatican accused weakland of 
causing confusion among the faithful of the united states 
concerning abortion 
weakland has maintained he respects the churchs opposition to 
abortion but believes church leaders need to better examine the 
reasons why women including catholics risk sin to obtain 
abortions 
he held six meetings this year with women in his archdiocese to 
discuss the question then issued a letter that criticized some 
tactics of antiabortion protesters as demeaning and lacking 
compassion 
the same letter also suggested that some people who describe 
themselves as prochoice may not necessarily advocate abortion 
and their views needed to be reconciled with those of the church 
weakland said he considered the vaticans censure confusing and 
has written a letter asking for clarification 
everybodys shrugging their shoulders wondering whats going 
on he said 
weakland said church leaders have warned that his views are 
not without theological implications but he doesnt plan to 
change his outspoken approach to the issue after the censure 
it wont change my procedure im sure in dealing with any 
topic im not concerned about that he said 
he added that the loss of the award was insignificant when 
compared to the insight he gained from discussing abortion with 
women

the embattled government of former 
communists survived a noconfidence vote on friday but the 
opposition kept up the pressure by declaring a boycott in 
parliament 
petar beron leader of the opposition union of democratic 
forces said his parliamentary faction was temporarily 
interrupting its participation in parliament and consulting with 
voters 
meanwhile the nations largest union expressed disgust with 
both the government and opposition it said it would circulate a 
petition among its hundreds of thousands of members expressing no 
confidence in lawmakers 
premier andrei lukanov had tied his political fate to the 
parliamentary noconfidence vote it came after months of wrangling 
between his socialists and the opposition on how to turn around the 
moribund economy and end bulgarias political paralysis 
the noconfidence motion was defeated 201159 in secret 
balloting in the 400seat grand national assembly it came a day 
after lawmakers approved lukanovs austerity budget in a vote 
boycotted by the opposition lukanov had threatened to resign if 
the budget had failed to pass 
krastyu petkov head of the independent labor federation 
appealed to president zhelyu zhelev to call new elections he told 
state television a nonpolitial government of experts should run 
the country in the interim 
a smaller trade union has called a general strike starting 
monday if lukanov does not step down before then but the general 
prosecutor issued a statement friday warning that strikes based 
solely on political demands were not permitted 
prior to the vote lukanov defended himself against charges by 
the opposition that his government was ineffective and called for 
dialogue and honest compromise 
the socialists formerly the communist party won june elections 
and have 210 of the 400 seats in parliament but because some of 
those seats are held by renegades lukanov has not been able to 
count on a majority 
scarce supplies of food and consumer goods have fired anger 
among bulgarias frustrated citizens about the economic crisis and 
the political deadlock 
opposition leaders claim they would triumph in new elections 
and that bulgaria would win more international aid under an 
oppositionled government than one of former communists but 
lukanov said international aid does not depend on the color of 
the government 
the premier who returned to sofia on thursday from a 34nation 
paris summit said talks with other leaders convinced him no one 
would help a country in which there is no stability in which the 
reforms are not decisively implemented 
the opposition has repeatedly rejected lukanovs requests to 
join a broad socialistled coalition government insisting instead 
on naming the premier and holding key ministries

they said point blank if you dont fire the elf well 
terminate your contract he said

allegations concerning the elf but he said that wasnt the reason 
old styles contract was invalidated and said the contract says 
management needs no reason to cancel the contract

of the allegation or a affidavit containing the store employees 
claim 
old style will remain at the mall until its contract ends at the 
end of the month said zolnowsky

iraq on friday canceled a night curfew in 
kuwait to convey that kuwait is calmer now but also began calling 
army reservists in their 30s to join troops facing multinational 
forces in the persian gulf 
a defense department communique broadcast on baghdad radio did 
not say how many reservists fell into the age group specified 
those born from 195860 but it would include battlehardened 
veterans of the 198088 iraniraq war 
they apparently will be part of a callup of 150000 reserves and 
draftees that iraq said this week would be sent to occupied emirate 
along with about 100000 regular army troops 
the curfew announcement reported by the official iraqi news 
agency and monitored in nicosia followed a twoday trip by 
president saddam hussein to kuwait and southern iraq 
ina said lifting the 11 pm7 am curfew was taken to 
confirm the return of normal life to the governate 
following its blitz invasion of kuwait on aug 2 iran declared 
kuwait iraqs 19th province or governate 
refugees from kuwait reported an active though diminishing 
resistance struggle there 
saddam inspected kuwait on thursday and told the troops he would 
fight to inflict defeat and disappointment on the evil 
blasphemers in event of a usled offensive 
the visit came as president bush spent thanksgiving in saudi 
arabia with some of the 230000 us servicemen so far deployed in 
operation desert shield us troops make up most of the 
multinational army opposing iraq 
after getting acquainted with conditions of the citizens in 
the province of basra the president saddam paid a visit to the 
4th and 2nd army corps and the command of the republican guard 
forces ina said 
the 4th and 2nd corps are usually based in the central sector of 
the border with iran they were apparently redeployed to reinforce 
troops in the south in august after saddam suddenly acceded to 
irans peace demands for a final end to their eightyear war 
the republican guards are an elite corps of 120000 men who 
spearheaded the invasion of kuwait at least six divisions are 
deployed south of basra as a strategic reserve for iraqi forces 
occupying kuwait 
iraq now has about 430000 troops in southern iraq and kuwait 
bush has ordered the us force in the region increased by an 
additional 200000 troops mainly armored units based in germany 
by midjanuary 
that will bolster the us and allied forces in the region to 
around 550000 personnel and give the multinational force an 
offensive capability 
the force originally was deployed to defend saudi arabia and its 
oilfields 
iraqs army has seven corps totaling 55 divisions including 
555000 regular troops and 480000 reserves 
saddam had to abandon plans to form 10 new divisions with up to 
as many as 150000 men because of a manpower shortage iraq has a 
population of 16 million including about 15 million men aged 
1832

four fishermen were missing and feared dead friday 
after a british nuclear submarine snagged their trawlers fishing 
gear and dragged the boat under water 
the search for the crew continues defense minister archie 
hamilton told the house of commons but sadly it now seems 
extremely unlikely that they will be found alive 
hamilton said the royal navy and the transportation department 
will investigate how the submarine hms trenchant caught the boats 
fishing gear and pulled it under thursday in the firth of clyde off 
southwestern scotland 
a naval vessels underwater video equipment discovered the 
wreckage of the 52foot trawler antares early friday 390 feet below 
the surface said coast guard spokesman roger clarke 
he said the land and sea search for the fishermen was centered 
on the isle of arran 
fishermen and friends of the missing men said submarine 
activities in the firth of clyde should be suspended 
quite a few people are getting angrier and angrier said the 
rev alastair dunlop a minister in carradale the trawlers home 
port everybody finds it hard to believe that a modern submarine 
does not know theres a fishing boat above it 
hamilton said the royal navy had operated submarines in the 
firth of clyde area for more than 80 years with an excellent 
safety record 
this incident was a tragedy but it seems to have been a very 
freak accident he said 
clarke said no one was concerned about the incident until the 
fishing boat did not return to port later thursday searchers then 
spotted an oil slick and the wreckage he said

mikhail s gorbachev said friday he and president 
bush agreed the un security council should be convened soon to 
discuss the persian gulf and said higher ranking officials than 
un representatives may attend 
the soviet president denied reports he and bush disagreed when 
they met monday night in paris 
i can tell you that meeting i had with president bush only 
reinforced our cooperation he told a news conference 
we need to find a common solution gorbachev said repeating 
his call for the security council to meet in the nearfuture 
once we have the security council in session i am sure that 
it will be able to adopt a course that would be adequate to meet 
the requirements of the situaion 
i am not sure whether it is going to be a resolution or any 
other formal document 
i dont think that it would be on the permanent representative 
level we might perhaps give some thought to having another 
level for that security council meeting which we would approach 
with full seriousness 
he did not specify who might attend from the soviet side 
gorbachev rejected speculation that he and bush differed on 
their approach to the crisis which began with iraqs invasion of 
kuwait on aug 2 
the analysis that we made with president bush showed that we 
have to continue to act within the framework of the un security 
council so that we can tell the aggressor to comply with the 
demands of the security council 
he said that some news media reports pointed to cracks between 
the two countries because the two leaders decided not to have a 
press conference and this gave rise to reports of some divisions 
between us monday night 
instead said gorbachev he and bush agreed the situation is 
fraught with grave consequences larger than those that we had in 
afghanistan or vietnam 
this is something very serious and that is why we must 
cooperate here on the basis of a joint approach that we developed 
we maintain systematic contacts so that we continue to control the 
situation he said 
therefore as a result of our frank analysis and exchange of 
views we concluded that time made it essential for the security 
council to be convened and to consider the situation no one can 
speak for the security council irrespective of the role played by 
the two countries the soviet union and the united states they 
still have to act together with the united nations he said 
in cairo egypt on friday bush said he was very close to 
getting un approval for using force to try to oust iraq from 
kuwait

president mikhail s gorbachev warned friday that 
a breakup of the soviet union could lead to bloodshed and 
civil conflict and said he will use all his constitutional 
powers to prevent it 
we will not be able to divide and when such attempts have 
been made the results were bloodshed and grave consequences 
gorbachev said in a wideranging news conference 
he spoke shortly after the supreme soviet legislature endorsed 
his general plans to reorganize the executive branch of government 
and gave him two weeks to take steps to alleviate shortages in the 
nations food supply 
the legislature also passed a state of the union resolution 
asking its chairman anatoly lukyanov to begin urgent negotiations 
with his counterparts in the 15 soviet republics for agreements to 
stop the political disintegration of the country 
the resolution expressed serious concern about the collapse of 
central authority and recommended gorbachev take all steps 
authorized by law up to extraordinary measures in cases where 
there is a threat to human life health or property 
it seeks to end a national paralysis of power resulting from the 
republics acting independently in introducing reforms to switch 
from a centrally planned to a market economy 
all the soviet republics except kirgizia have declared some form 
of sovereignty and the three baltic republics have declared 
independence 
it was the second time in a week the supreme soviet endorsed 
gorbachevs proposal to eliminate the council of ministers or 
soviet cabinet and replace it with several bodies under direct 
presidential control 
its unclear if the legislature will take up the gorbachev 
reform plan again 
prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov whose job would be eliminated 
under the government realignment was quoted by the government 
newspaper izvestia as saying he was prepared to step down if 
gorbachevs proposals are accepted 
ryzhkov said the proposals announced last saturday by 
gorbachev caught him by surprise 
ryzhkov and radical lawmaker anatoly sobchak the mayor of 
leningrad criticized gorbachevs proposals as sketchy 
there isnt any complete picture of the system of the 
political government of the country he was quoted as saying 
gorbachev said he respected the autonomy of the republics but 
that if any of their leaders try to act in the way of an 
ultimatum they will destabilize the situation and make it more 
difficult and i as the president also have a limit 
asked later whether he would use force to prevent any republic 
from seceding gorbachev said we will stay within the 
constitution in negotiating a new union treaty to serve as a 
charter uniting the republics 
any republic wishing to leave the union he said must respect a 
soviet law passed this year requiring a referendum 
it is a whole divorce procedure he said 
attempts to leave the union without a referendum would be a 
tragedy to our peoples he said it would lead to civil 
conflict with the most grave consequences and that would bring the 
country to a situation unacceptable to the world community as 
well 
the resolution contained a gloomy assessment of the countrys 
economic and political affairs the situation in the country 
continues to worsen and is approaching a crisis condition it 
said 
the legislature also gave the kgb security police responsibility 
for dealing with what it called economic sabotage 
the supreme soviet in endorsing gorbachevs plans to 
streamline the executive branch removed a requirement for the 
president to consult with leaders in the republics before making 
the changes 
the plan appeared designed to remove officials who are resistant 
to radical reform and bring representatives of the republics into 
the central government 
under the outline the council of ministers would be replaced by 
several bodies under presidential control the principal ruling 
body would be the federation council grouping representatives of 
the republics 
gorbachev offered few details on his ideas to improve the 
economy other than saying he would propose changes in laws 
covering finances transportation energy resources agriculture 
and landholding 
the resolution called on gorbachev within the next two weeks 
to work out a program to improve the food situation and ensure 
distribution of food from abroad 
and he said that western nations were offering food credits and 
other forms of assistance to the soviet union during the winter 
his spokesman vitaly ignatenko said this week that gorbachev 
had won promises of up to 10 billion in aid from germany italy 
canada spain and britain 
president bush also has offered to aid the soviet union this 
winter

mandela and president fw de klerk are due to meet tuesday for 
talks aimed at setting up negotiations on a new constitution to 
give political power to the black majority both sides had said 
they wanted to begin fullfledged negotiations early next year 
however the whiteled government has recently criticized anc 
calls for increased protests and other forms of mass action against 
apartheid the south african system of racial separation and white 
dominance the two sides also have differed over the causes of 
black factional fighting in townships near johannesburg that has 
killed more than 800 people since august 
mandela said friday he would advocate a constituent assembly to 
draw up a new constitution and an interim administration to govern 
until the process is completed 
antiapartheid groups have previously called for interim 
leadership and an elected constituent assembly to ease south 
africas transition to a nonracial government the government has 
rejected an interim leadership 
however de klerk has pledged to eliminate apartheid and to 
share political power with blacks he asks protection of minority 
rights under any new system 
the anc wants a nonracial system with equal voting rights for 
all citizens 
under apartheid the 5 million whites control the government 
while the 30 million blacks have no national voting rights

about 2000 owners breeders trainers 
jockeys and stable grooms held a sitin protest with dozens of 
arabian steeds friday at the shellbattered race track over a 
government decision to build a presidential palace there 
the protesters who gathered at th walled midcity hippodrome 
pledged to resume racing at the beginning of the new year 
we shall race anew despite the government decision nabil 
freij a leading member of the tracks governing committee told 
reporters 
the track has long been a prime symbol of national unity its 
choice for a new palace ground shatters this symbol 
as he spoke graceful arabians trained at the track for the first 
time in two years hundreds of moslem and christian fans joined in 
the applause as the horses paraded 
the track is governed by the committee for preserving the 
dynasty of the arabian horse which allows only arabian steeds to 
race throroughbreds are prohibited 
bulldozers were clearing the rubble of 15 years of civil war 
during which the track because of its location right on beiruts 
dividing green line was caught in christianmoslem crossfire 
the track called the palace of peace was closed and reopened 
more than a dozen times during the civil war the last closure was 
in march 1989 during a rebellion by renegade gen michel aoun 
now peace finally seems to be coming to this nation of roughly 
35 million people 
of the 700 racing arabians in the stables at the track 400 
survived shelling duels between troops loyal to aoun and regulars 
and irregulars with whom he fought intermittenty until his 
rebellion was crushed on oct 13 
some horses were killed in their boxes many perished of hunger 
and thirst when breeders and stable grooms fled 
the heavy shellfire punched huge craters in the milelong oval 
track wrecked sections of the galleries and left gaping holes in 
the threestory headquarters of the governing committee 
the loss is colossal for us something around 5 million 
within the track said freij whose family has a breeding farm in 
east lebanons bekaa valley and now we have this irresponsible 
decision of the government 
on nov 7 president elias hrawis cabinet decided to build a 
new palace and government complex for the prime minister at the 
pinewooded track 
the old palace in suburban baabda a main target during the 
sectarian conflict was demolished by syrian warplanes during the 
drive against aoun 
hrawis administration has abolished the citys demarcation line 
and ordered civil war irregulars to withdraw from the capital and 
its environs to create a unified militiafree greater beirut 
you dont inaugurate a united greater beirut with an act of 
disunity freij said thats what the decision to build the 
palace on the race track amounts to 
the track has been one of the few places where up to 10000 
fans rich and poor moslems and christians mixed at weekends 
freij inherited the racing passion from his father the late 
marquis moussa de freij who founded the track with millionaire 
sportsman henry pharoun now 90 about 70 years ago 
moslem horse owners and breeders flanked freij a christian as 
he warned on friday that closing the track would strip 2500 
families of their only source of income 
ive been spending 4000 a month for years now to keep my 
trainers and stable grooms with my 33 arabians waiting for the day 
races will resume said antoine kashouh a christian will the 
government feed them now 
moslem trainer mohammed haddar said at times during the fighting 
he had to buy food one day for his family and one day for the 
horses he cared for 
he complained weve starved to keep the horses we survived 
the civil war the 1982 israeli invasion and aouns wars hoping 
against all odds to race again with peace in sight now the 
government says no its not fair 
the track was inaugurated in 1916 under the ottoman empire the 
present governing committee took an 80year lease for the grounds 
in 1920 when france ruled lebanon after world war i

a condemned killer suspected in the 
slayings of nearly two dozen young men is under investigation in 
the fatal stabbing of an indiana man whose body was found in 1982 
police said friday 
the investigation launched a couple of weeks ago is a result 
of the release of a book detailing the life of larry eyler 
convicted in 1986 for the murder of 15yearold danny bridges of 
chicago 
bridges dismembered body was found in august 1984 in trash bags 
behind eylers chicago apartment eyler is on death row at the 
pontiac correctional center in pontiac 80 miles southwest of 
chicago 
eyler is suspected of killing 23 young men in illinois indiana 
kentucky and wisconsin from 1982 through 1984 said detective dan 
colin of the lake county sheriffs department he was tried only in 
bridges death 
according to court testimony eyler a homosexual was into 
bondage some of his sexual partners testified that he enjoyed 
tying them up all of the victims in which eyler is a suspect were 
stabbed and their pants were pulled down 
a judge in lake county where the body of 28yearold ralph e 
calise of chicago was found in august 1983 ruled that police 
violated eylers rights during a search which officials said 
yielded crucial evidence in the calise case 
in september 1983 indiana authorities investigating eyler in a 
series of killings had confiscated some of his belongings 
including his boots and a knife he was detained for hours but 
never charged 
police later said blood taken from eylers boots matched 
calises 
because lake county officials believed indiana authorities had 
failed to make proper prints of the tires of eylers truck they 
conducted their own search 
but the lake county judge convinced that indiana authorities 
had violated eylers constitutional rights suppressed the indiana 
evidence and because the illinois search of eyler was prompted by 
the one in indiana the judge ruled that that evidence too should 
be suppressed 
without the evidence authorities had no case and eyler 36 of 
greencastle ind was freed six months later he was arrested in 
bridges slaying 
since then the evidence from the indiana search had remained in 
lake county 
on wednesday as a result of the book freed to kill the true 
story of larry eyler prosecutor larry thomas of vermillion 
county ind took the suppressed evidence to use in his 
investigation of an unsolved murder 
detective colin said thomas had reopened the murder case of 
23yearold steve agan of terre haute ind and planned to convene 
a grand jury using the evidence that was suppressed in illinois 
agans body was found near newport ind in december 1982 
my understanding is that the book gave them some insight they 
didnt know back then colin said 
we have a lot of unsolved murders out there said colin one 
of the investigators in the calise case im always glad when 
someone is able to put together a murder case and solve their 
stuff 
its just too bad that a book had to come out to force indiana 
authorities to reopen some of the 16 cases attributed to larry 
eyler kolarik said

opposition parties in serbia said 
friday they will boycott the republics first free elections in 50 
years because ruling officials rejected demands to change rules on 
casting and counting ballots 
the republics communistcontrolled parliament on thursday 
denied requests to allow opposition officials into staterun 
ballotcounting commissions and permit some serbs abroad to vote 
in the dec 9 election 
a statement by 12 opposition parties said parliaments decision 
blocked the most elementary conditions for fair elections and 
wiped out the last chance of compromise with the ruling 
socialists the new name adopted by the communist party 
the statement also demanded the resignation of serbias 
communist president slobodan milosevic and the ouster of parliament 
leaders and other communist officials 
the parties urged voters to join the boycott and attend a 
protest rally dec 3 in belgrade 
the statement was signed by leaders of the centerright serbian 
renewal movement the democratic party the serbian branch of 
federal premier ante markovics alliance of reformist forces and 
other parties 
about 50 opposition parties are registered for the vote many 
have complained they had less access to statecontrolled media for 
their campaigns 
vuk draskovic who was the top challenger to milosevic said his 
renewal movement had planned to contest all 250 parliament seats 
but under the boycott only milosevics socialists and a few newly 
formed communist groups would run he said 
the statement said unfair elections would make serbia along 
with albania the last bolshevik ghetto in europe and isolate the 
republic 
following the vote thursday parliament chairman zoran sokolovic 
said current law drawn up by the socialists ensures democratic 
elections 
nebojsa popov head of the small opposition union for yugoslav 
democratic initiative said the vote would be a farce under the 
present election rules 
serbia the largest of yugoslavias six republics and 
montengro the smallest are the last to hold multiparty elections 
communists were ousted last spring in the western republics of 
slovenia and croatia 
in the central state of bosniahercegovina nationalist parties 
had a landslide victory over communists 
in last novembers singleparty serbian elections unregistered 
voters were allowed to cast ballots in some districts milosevic 
won with 104 percent of the registered voters in some areas 
parliament also began discussing a ban on the democratic 
alliance of kosovo which opposes serbias rule over the kosovo 
province where ethnic albanians make up 90 percent of the 19 
million people 
the democratic alliance supported by the ethnic albanians 
registered as a party with federal authorities but not with 
serbian officials serbia clamped down on the provinces autonomy 
in july after kosovos parliament declared sovereignty

consumers wandered the nations malls and main streets on 
friday starting a christmas shopping season that retailers fear 
will be their worst in years because of the twin grinches of a weak 
economy and the persian gulf crisis 
in keeping with a tradition thats as much a part of 
thanksgiving weekend as leftover turkey shoppers lined up early 
some standing in the rain before stores opened 
by midmorning many an aisle was crowded from midtown 
manhattans swank department stores to the state street mall in 
chicago to the shops that ring san franciscos picturesque union 
square 
were having a phenomenal year a record year said rebecca 
schulz store manager for fao schwartz on union square we opened 
at 9 am and there was a line waiting to come in past the toy 
soldier were seeing everything fly out the door the basic toys 
games cuddly toys electronic goods 
other san francisco merchants were similarly ebullient about the 
1990 holiday season 
but elsewhere lines at some cash registers were ominously 
short substantiating fears of retailers who had predicted they 
would host browsers not buyers 
many shoppers are trimming holiday budgets because they already 
have been squeezed financially by higher fuel prices while talk of 
an economic downturn has unnerved them 
im going to cut mine at least in half said sharon stowe of 
cary nc who with her daughterinlaw was eyeing a model train 
display at a mall in raleigh 
wanda mcnamara of new cumberland pa said she has not been 
personally threatened with a layoff or loss of income still she 
is taking recession talk seriously 
im watching my dollars she said while waiting for boscovs 
department store to open in harrisburg pa im more careful 
more selective im looking for sales im cutting down on the 
christmas list 
the first few days of christmas shopping season are scrutinized 
by retailers because theyre considered a barometer of what to 
expect in their most critical time of year when they make about 
half their annual sales 
no one is expecting this to be a great or even very good 
christmas shopping season 
some pessimists including retail industry analyst daniel barry 
of kidder peabody amp co in new york have even said it will be the 
worst holiday season since the 1974 recession 
the thanksgiving weekend has lost some significance in recent 
years because more consumers shop later in the season but it still 
helps stores decide when to offer sales and what items they must 
restock 
gary ebel assistant general manager of skagway department store 
in grand island neb said he had no idea how the holiday retail 
season would turn out once the day after thanksgiving had passed 
normally its one of the biggest days of the year for us 
ebel said thats proved to be false for us for several years 
our biggest day is the last saturday before christmas and it seems 
to be moving toward that trend 
still ebel and other merchants resorted to gimmicks to lure 
buyers 
we gave away poinsettias to the first 300 customers and we 
got rid of those in 15 minutes ebel said we had books of 
stamps at 25 cents off today for two hours 
consumer spending which slipped as the economy weakened this 
year dropped precipitously after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
not only were consumers shaken by prospects of war but they 
suddenly found themselves paying more for gasoline and heating oil 
the middle east turmoil however has inspired some merchants a 
florida discount store offered put a stain on hussein toilet 
paper featuring pictures of the iraqi leader for 1 a roll 
its flying out of here said jack rohn manager of the 
everythings a 100 store at the sawgrass mills shopping mall 
near fort lauderdale 
the scenario is particularly grim for retailers hurt last 
season many were forced to slash prices to bring in sales and 
several suffered earnings drops or losses 
their hope to avoid a repeat this year is faint 
at the giant glendale galleria mall in suburban los angeles 
many shoppers said the foot traffic looked lighter than usual 
friday 
at d laurenti a boutique specializing in 725 italian suits 
and 195 shirts assistant manager john tawlian said sales were off 
as much as 30 percent as the holiday season began 
we dont have big hopes he said as shoppers strolled by his 
empty store things could change but if you ask me its not 
going to be as good as last year

thailand has agreed to legalize import of 
american and other foreign cigarettes and the us governent is 
ending its 18month investigation of unfair trade charges against 
the southeast asian country it was announced friday 
we have been guided by the principles of obtaining fair and 
nondiscriminatory access to the thai market without in any way 
seeking to encourage smoking as a personal habit said a 
statement from us trade representative carla a hills 
the announcement did not mention cigarette advertising banned 
in thailand and one of the controversial issues in washington 
public hearings and in prolonged negotiations between the two 
governments but her office confirmed mrs hills midoctober 
statement that with respect to advertising we did not push that 
issue 
the us cigarette export association filed charges of unfair 
trading against thailand in 1989 if upheld those charges could 
have led to retaliatory measures 
industry critics including former us surgeon general c 
everett coop objected that the us government should not be 
promoting exports of a health hazard 
some charged that the us tobacco industry sought to undermine 
thailands official antismoking campaign and to glamorize smoking 
among new users such as youth and women they said this happened in 
three other asian countries where us cigarette brands gained 
market access japan south korea and taiwan 
the us industry and representatives of tobaccogrowing states 
demanded the issue be treated as strictly commercial they charged 
that the health issue was introduced to protect the thai government 
tobacco monopoly 
as long as thailand sees fit to produce and sell its own 
cigarettes to its own people we see no reason that foreign 
cigarette manufacturers should not have the same opportunity 
mrs hills said friday 
a breakthrough in the case came when a panel of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade earlier this year supported us 
demands for market access but did not support demands that us 
brands be allowed to advertise 
thailand then agreed to discuss admitting imports and the us 
side in midoctober passed up publishing a list of thai products 
subject to potential penalty duties if the ban had continued 
sunday was the deadline for mrs hills to recommend final action 
on the industry petition 
mrs hills said in october the us government would abide by 
the gatt ruling on advertising even though is going to be 
difficult for foreigners to get their products in and known it 
will simply have to be carried by word of mouth 
her office must decide by yearend on another us industry 
petition to launch a new investigation of thailand involving piracy 
of motion pictures music recordings computer softwear books and 
trademarks

twenty private pilots took off friday on an 
annual airlift of medical supplies clothing and food to a remote 
mexican town 
we celebrated our own good fortune and the blessings weve had 
on our thanksgiving day and then we try to give it to somebody else 
afterwards because weve got plenty left over said don greif 
66 an organizer of the 10yearold event 
aviators from santa barbara to bakersfield contributed items to 
be flown in small planes from van nuys airport in los angeles to 
santa rosalia in baja california the town has an airstrip but no 
control tower 
this years cargo included two new wheelchairs crutches and 
first aid packages valuable items in a town miles from any 
hospital 
the towns copper mine closed years ago increasing unemployment 
where people already were underemployed greif said its a 
deprived area he added theres no stable income there 
the airlift is a festive occasion children from the school 
receive candy and clothes and after the exhausting sixhour 
flight pilots are greeted with food and beer provided by 
residents 
mexican marines guard the planes overnight and the pilots sleep 
in the only hotel nearby a place where showers are often cold 
the 642mile trip is not easy said greif 
fuel can be an obstacle the us drug enforcement 
administration and the mexican government have been trying to stem 
the flow of drugs out of the country by removing fuel supplies from 
lesser known airstrips 
the pilots fly over the sea for an hour after leaving mexicali

christmas tree rustling in national forests 
in southern california is one annual holiday season ritual that 
should be stopped forest rangers say 
a lot of people think that if i just take one its not a 
problem said carla van dyne at the tujunga district office of 
angeles national forest once they start cutting or even damage 
the tree it is going to die 
us forest service officials report problems with poachers 
taking trees without permits and outside designated areas at los 
padres angeles and san bernardino national forests 
tree thievery is especially serious in southern california 
forests because there are relatively few evergreens to begin with 
the trees are already harmed by disease insects and smog 
foresters said 
nabbing the culprits can be tough for example only six federal 
employees keep watch over the 500000acre mount pinos reserve in 
the los padres national forest in northern ventura county 
officials estimate that thieves cut down and steal 20 to 30 fir and 
pine trees every year 
don trammell a recreation and operations officer at mount 
pinos said about two tree rustlers are caught each year 
the penalty for taking a tree is usually a 50 fine but the 
penalty can be as heavy as a 5000 fine and can include a oneyear 
jail term 
mount pinos firefighter jamie moore said thieves have been known 
to climb tall firs and saw off the top half the remainder of the 
tree usually dies because it is vulnerable to a species of 
woodeating beetle she said 
what they are taking is not so much a commodity but something 
that is high in value in the recreational sense forest service 
officer john kelly said

eight hundred cows contaminated 
with toxic compounds will be slaughtered and burned to ashes by the 
end of the year in southern moravia the independent daily mlada 
fronta dnes reported friday 
their milk and meat contain excessive levels of polychlorated 
biphenyls pcbs with levels equally high in the meat of their 
offspring it said it gave no precise figures 
newly born calves have the same levels of pcbs as their 
mothers that is why the first to be slaughtered were pregnant 
cows the daily quoted zdenek havlicek chief of the borsice 
cooperative as saying 
it said that following slaughter of the first 150 cows friday 
arrangements were made to pulverize the carcasses and put them in 
special containers 
pcbs are chemical additives contained in paint used for 
agricultural equipment 
such chemicals were banned for use in czechoslovakia in 1984 
but the pcb content in the food chain has been increasingly noticed 
by environmentalists 
to destroy pcbs temperatures above 1832 degrees are needed it 
said but furnaces in czechoslovakia cannot now work at such 
temperatures 
we are also storing some 150 tons of butter contaminated with 
pcbs havlicek said 
about 60 percent of the pcbs detected in the cows came from the 
paint of silage pits and were absorbed through the cows fodder 
mlada fronta dnes said 
the rest was blamed on general pcb pollution of the evironment

customers deluged a tucson supermarket 
chain with turkeys some of them already cooked after a man 
claimed to have injected some of the birds with cyanide 
the pima county health department said friday that about 4600 
turkeys would be buried in a landfill north of tucson they 
included about 550 turkeys the store took off its shelves and about 
4050 that customers returned 
jim acton vice president of media operations for smiths food 
and drug stores estimated that the cyanide scare would cost the 
supermarket chain as much as 200000 
the store on friday offered a 10000 reward for information 
leading to the arrest of the perpetrator and authorities in tucson 
and surrounding pima county also offered a 1000 reward 
a man called reporteranchorwoman barbara grijalva of koldtv on 
wednesday to say he had injected some smiths turkeys with cyanide 
police have said there was no evidence that the birds were tainted 
the supermarket chain removed turkeys from its four tucson 
stores and offered refunds or exchanges to customers who recently 
had purchased turkeys no stores outside of tucson were affected 
ninety to 95 percent of the customers who brought turkeys to the 
store on thursday asked for a refund instead of another turkey 
store officials said 
samples have been taken of all the varieties of turkeys from the 
tucson stores and will be tested for poisoning acton said 
it appears to be simply the work of a hoax of a very sick 
person who either has a grudge to bear against smiths or only 
wished to cause a great deal of anguish among innocent people

egyptian president hosni mubarak said friday 
the united states and other countries should liberate kuwait before 
they confront the question of how to maintain peace in the face of 
mounting iraqi military power 
let us start by liberating kuwait complete withdrawal and 
then this issue should be studied in the negotiations after the 
withdrawal mubarak said in an interview with nbcs tom brokaw 
aired friday night 
the interview came after president bushs visit earlier friday 
with the egyptian president egypt has promised up to 20000 troops 
to the international force in saudi arabia to liberate kuwait 
iraq maintains a chemical warfare capability and some analysts 
say it will be able to launch nucleartipped missiles in 10 years 
unless stopped strategists have pondered whether go beyond 
liberating kuwait in the current crisis and use the opportunity to 
topple iraqi president saddam hussein before he gets a nuclear 
arsenal 
mubarak brushed aside a question on what would happen if saddam 
were allowed to maintain his military power and used it to attack 
israel 
you in america are going through so many items mubarak 
said you are saying supposing he may attack israel then he may 
attack saudi arabia iraq is not a superpower 
as for getting iraq out of kuwait mubarak said president bush 
is eager to solve the problem peacefully as much as he can 
but at the same time if he didnt find a way to solve it peacefully 
he is going to use force 
there is no other way else he said if there is no other 
way to solve the problem them we will have to use force 
but he reiterated that egyptian forces would not go beyond 
kuwait and fight inside iraq itself 
our troops will not go to iraq because we are not going to 
liberate iraq mubarak said the problem is kuwait 
he also said the parties to the dispute should tackle the 
palestinian question because it is the crux of the whole problem 
this issue should move foward he said we should not 
neglect it

juveniles charged in the halloween rape and murder of a 26yearold 
woman and a black leader blamed police for mishandling its 
investigation because the woman was black 
a woman who says she was a witness said she has been warned not 
to talk to authorities 
at this point in time i think that he should be tried as a 
juvenile said the juveniles attorney juliane balliro after a 
closed hearing in suffolk superior court he is 15 years of age 
and he has no prior criminal involvement whatsoever 
balliros client is one of eight youths charged in the death of 
26yearold kimberly rae harbour authorities alleged she was 
bludgeoned repeatedly raped and stabbed more than 100 times by a 
gang of teenagers roaming the streets in search of women to rob 
the suffolk county district attorney is seeking to have the five 
juveniles charged as adults in her death three other young men 
aged 17 18 and 19 were charged as adults 
conviction as an adult on a charge of firstdegree murder would 
bring an automatic life sentence without parole if the five youths 
are found delinquent as juveniles they could be released on their 
18th birthday 
also friday a leader in the citys black community sadiki 
kambon of the black information center called for the resignation 
of boston police commissioner francis roache 
kambon said the departments investigation into the slaying only 
highlighted of failure of police to properly serve minorities in 
the city 
there was no immediate response from roache to the call for his 
resignation he did not return telephone calls 
the slaying more than three weeks ago initially drew little 
public notice after police announced it as a homicide details 
werent released until this week after the arrests 
 
blacks have complained that residents should have been warned of 
the attack earlier so they could protect themselves 
kambon also repeated criticism of the police handling of the 
stuart case the shooting death of carol stuart in october 1989 
brought police into a minority neighborhood to search for a suspect 
after stuarts husband charles said he and his pregnant wife were 
attacked there by a black mugger 
charles stuart later apparently committed suicide after learning 
he had become a prime suspect in his wifes death 
kambon also called for more minority police patrols in the inner 
city and said minorities must do more to help youngsters 
we have to assume some of the responsibility for whats going 
on out here kambon said 
meanwhile a possible witness of harbours death said she has 
been warned not to talk to authorities 
i need some protection laura peterson 40 told the boston 
herald 
peterson told police she fled to safety while eight young men 
chased harbour into a park in the citys dorchester section and 
killed her 
peterson said a man knocked on the door of an apartment where 
she was staying thursday and gave her a message from a boy she 
said the message was to keep your mouth shut 
on the night of the killing peterson said she was standing with 
harbour who she assumed was out selling her body 
she said three masked teenagers tried to rob her before joining 
others in chasing harbour who she said was yelling help me help 
me 
peterson said she was too frightened even after reaching a 
friends apartment to call police

a woman with 46 personalities has 
acknowledged having sex with a key witness in the trial of a man 
who was convicted of sexually assaulting her 
the admission is significant in part because under wisconsin 
law having sex with a mentally ill person can be a crime 
winnebago county district attorney joseph paulus said the 
27yearold victim confirmed allegations in a court document that 
she had a sexual relationship with gerald reeves her downstairs 
neighbor 
she said its true i did do it paulus said adding he 
was uncertain whether the relationship would result in new criminal 
charges 
mark peterson 29 of oshkosh was convicted earlier this month 
of sexually assaulting the woman authorities argued he was guilty 
of a crime because he manipulated one of her personalities in june 
two days after he met her 
under wisconsin law it is a crime to have sex with a mentally 
ill person if the person is so severely impaired he or she cant 
appreciate the consequences of the behavior and if the other 
person knows of the illness 
paulus said its not clear whether any charges would be filed 
against reeves he said it would depend on whether the victim would 
file a complaint and whether it could be proven she was taken 
advantage of her because of her condition called multiple 
personality disorder 
reeves who testified during the trial about the victims 
vulnerability did not return telephone messages left at his house 
friday by reporters seeking comment he said in an earlier 
interview he was unaware of the allegations he has not been 
charged with any crime 
petersons attorney mary lou robinson said she would proceed 
with her plan to request a new trial for her client adding the 
latest allegations would assist her appeal 
the way this case developed has brought mockery upon the court 
system she said 
allegations that reeves had a relationship with the woman were 
contained in a letter sent wednesday by a former winnebago county 
counselor to county circuit judge robert hawley 
sheila m carmichael who counseled the woman was fired earlier 
wednesday for entering into a contract last week for movie and 
publication rights involving the victims story

one of the nations oldest chartered press 
clubs the 109yearold pittsburgh press club will close its doors 
for good by years end 
lets just say that the program we thought would work just 
didnt come to fruition the bricks just didnt fall into place 
club president a alan paulus said wednesday it takes a lot of 
support from the membership to keep it going ill just leave it at 
that 
a federal bankruptcy judge officially turned down the clubs 
attempts to reorganize under bankruptcy protection earlier this 
month the club has been in financial trouble since the early 1980s 
and filed for protection under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law 
in march 1989 
us bankruptcy judge joseph l cosetti said the club had no 
reasonable prospect of reorganizing 
officials blamed the clubs decline on a number of factors 
including difficulty in attracting younger members strife among 
club officers and between officers and management in addition 
many members did not return after a strike closed the club for 
three months in 1983 
in the latest attempt to save the press club not affiliated 
with the pittsburgh press officials had slashed the staff from 42 
to about a dozen moved to less expensive quarters increased dues 
and added about 200 members 
paulus said he would ask members to pay 25 each to keep the 
club operating through the holiday season 
as of sept 30 the club had 372384 in bills and only 28988 
in current assets to pay them some club vendors have unpaid bills 
dating to 1985

austrian immigrants who are paid 
reparations to compensate for nazi persecution cannot be 
disqualified from receiving us benefits for the lowincome aged 
blind or disabled a federal court has ruled 
chief us district judge thelton henderson said in a ruling 
released friday that austrian reparations must be treated like 
similar payments from the german government 
the us government had sought to differentiate austrian from 
german reparations questioning whether jews who fled austria 
should be considered victims of nazi persecution 
the ruling concerned a classaction lawsuit filed by an austrian 
immigrant herbert bondy who was 16 when his family fled austria 
in 1938 after germany occupied the country 
bondy who retired in 1980 had been received social security 
payments as well as benefits for the blind when he received his 
first reparation payment from austria in 1988 the social security 
administration counted the payments as income and disqualified him 
from benefits for his blindness 
henderson ruled that reparations from austria must be treated 
like those from germany referring to a 1984 ruling by the 9th us 
circuit court of appeals that excluded german reparations as income 
in determining eligibility for federal benefits 
about 8800 people in the united states receive austrian 
reparations an estimated 158 to 572 also collect federal benefits 
for the aged blind or disabled henderson said 
the us government has argued that only those interned by the 
nazis qualified for reparations 
henderson quoted the austrian consul general in los angeles as 
explaining austrian reparations were for a moral obligation in 
view of the great injustice and heavy suffering inflicted on the 
victims of nazi persecution while austria was under nazi 
occupation 
austria won back its independence in 1945 at the end of world 
war ii 
according to the national jewish congress austria had 
antijewish laws as early as 1935 and in 1938 jews commonly 
suffered beatings lootings and deportations a lawyer for the 
group j mark waxman described the reparations as modest but said 
he didnt know precise amounts 
the governments attorney could not be reached for comment

nations doctors who can perform the operation said friday he 
plans to quit surgery and concentrate on research 
starzl said the death earlier this month of one of his patients 
13yearold stormie jones left him emotionally drained the 
13yearold texas girl was the worlds first recipient of a 
heartliver transplant in 1984 
starzl 64 has not performed surgery since undergoing an 
operation in august to clear a blocked artery 
liver transplants are so standardized there really isnt any 
point in my handling cases he told the pittsburgh postgazette 
we have eight to 10 lead surgeons

to allow him to study the effects of fk506 an antirejection drug 
approved by the us department of agriculture for use only at 
presbyterian university and childrens hospitals in pittsburgh 
about 1000 transplant patients now take the drug which studies 
show is more effective than its predecessor cyclosporine 
starzl said he also hopes to improve the search for organ donors 
and delivery of their organs 
starzl performed the first liver transplant in 1963 and it 
failed he had his first success four years later at the university 
of colorado at denver 
he also pioneered development of a medical team that performed 
200 kidney transplants at colorado general and denver veterans 
administration hospitals 
starzl began working in 1981 at the university of pittsburgh 
which he helped turn into one of the worlds premier transplant 
centers last year the hospital performed more than 460 liver 
transplants and 210 kidney transplants 
since starzls earliest efforts thousands of such transplants 
have been performed around the world 
on valentines day 1984 starzl led the team that lifted a 
diseased heart and liver from stormie jones then 6 and replaced 
them giving her six more years of life 
i saw her grow up and i saw her at deaths door said 
starzl who was one of her principal surgeons 
stormie of white settlement texas died nov 11 when her body 
suddenly rejected her transplanted heart more than six years after 
the historic operation that saved her life 
when you lose a patient like that its awful said starzl 
who was traveling in europe when he learned she had died

resolutions aimed at iraq since the august invasion 
running the security council gives the bush administration a 
tactical advantage once yemen is in the chair it would be that 
much tougher to win adoption of a resolution to use force as a last 
resort to liberate kuwait 
theres a lot of ways to get thoroughly wrapped around the 
axle of the united nations a senior state department official 
said recently about the intricacies of the world organization 
there are a whole host of other things that can come up so its 
important to try and do it during the period of our presidency of

if it were possible to record the stale 
smell of beer and cigarettes in the air the wet circles left on a 
counter from bygone drinks and the jaded eyes of souls deep in 
their cups youd come up with burning tree 
the california trios selftitled debut album on epic draws upon 
the guitarbased blues of such 60s legends as cream and the jimi 
hendrix experience for its sound a refreshing change from glossy 
overproduced radio fare 
burning tree may sound like theyve been trapped in a time warp 
but they dont write songs that way 
were very derivative i suppose of the older sound but when 
youre a threepiece band you either sound like the police or you 
sound like cream bassist mark dutton said in a recent telephone 
interview 
when youre playing as a threepiece everybody has so much to 
do that you basically have to be proficient on your instrument so 
when you do that and you get into that jam mode you go over the 
edge he said 
blues references probably more so than classic rock ones 
abound in burning trees downanddirty style the albums title 
track warns against taking unnecessary risks in life like flying 
on a onewinged eagle 
the ballad playing in the wind is the bands warning to 
itself about letting fame go too far on the same theme the 
delightful crush about the pitfalls of show business shows a 
healthy sarcasm for people whove got a crush on one of us but 
they dont know which one it is 
dutton said burning trees selfappointed task was to update the 
blues subject matter 
all the great blues artists the reason they were so great and 
so loved is because they sang about their reality they sang about 
their life he said i think what we want to do is keep that 
sound that appealed to your ears so much but bring it up to date 
psychologically 
all three members of the band dutton guitarist marc ford and 
drummer doni gray sing and write material 
dutton who had always been in charge of previous bands said it 
was a learning experience not to be calling all the shots 
you have to stifle those feelings of being in charge he 
said those are natural feelings but you have to trust the other 
two people in your band and thats the only reason were a band 
is because we do trust each other 
the albums deliberate underproduction is noteworthy fords 
hoarse raspy voice is left alone even when it cracks during a 
verse and the albums entire sound is kept murky and dingy true 
to its blues roots 
if we actually do get a take all the way through where we sing 
the right words then we have to keep it because chances are we 
wouldnt be able to do it again he said 
but it gives the song charm you know its kind of like the 
perfect human being who would want to be with someone perfect 
itd get real boring after a while 
dutton credited producer tim palmer who also worked on david 
bowies tin machine for keeping burning trees live sound 
intact we had all these old ideas and he just knew when we were 
going a little too far and would step in and bring us up to date 
burning tree has been performing live for a year and a half the 
album was recorded in just eight weeks asked if the band had paid 
its dues dutton said 
i hope we never finish paying our dues but i think our heads 
are in the right place right now whether you want to call it 
paying your dues or not we just happened to be at the right place 
at the right time theres really no formula whatsoever 
we just play honestly and i think people can tell that he

creditors demand money foreign 
currency reserves are being drained to repay shortterm loans and 
domestic price increases are overdue so pakistan is asking for 
help 
theres no way we can cover the losses ourselves 1 billion 
we can make up on our own but we need help with another billion 
said sartaz aziz finance minister of the new government 
japan was the first to respond offering a 500 million aid 
package when president ghulam ishaq khan visited tokyo for the 
enthronement of emperor akihito 
in an effprt to make up the first billion pakistan plans to 
raise domestic prices implement strict oil conservation measures 
and push exports while reducing imports gasoline prices went up 
more than 40 percent this month 
last month the united states suspended 500 million in aid 
because of suspicions that pakistan has or is developing nuclear 
weapons 
it doesnt hurt us immediately aziz said theres still 
some aid in the pipeline 
because of the financial problems former prime minister benazir 
bhutto may have found a silver lining in her stunning election 
defeat oct 24 political analysts and economists say the 
opposition seats appear to be the safest place in parliament at the 
moment 
little was done about the economy for three months after ishaq 
khan dismissed ms bhuttos government aug 6 for alleged 
corruption 
the caretaker administration he appointed concentrated on 
keeping the nation afloat until a new government could be chosen 
it refused to increase prices because of the imminent election 
paying its bills instead with shortterm loans at high interest 
rates 
now the economic problems are likely to interfere with the 
industrial revolution conservative prime minister nawaz sharif has 
promised 
even the left saw the victory of sharif a wealthy businessman 
from humble beginnings as a catalyst for ending centuries of 
control by the feudal landlords class to which ms bhutto belongs 
economists say fiscal realism will have to be an essential part 
of the sharif governments plans 
you cant just do things because you want to one said on 
condition of anonymity youve got to bite the bullet increase 
prices or raise taxes or both 
foreign currency reserves have fallen to only 50 million the 
inflation rate is rising and another 2 billion has been added to 
the foreign debt raising it to about 155 billion 
a western economist said the additional debt was largely due to 
the higher oil price he said the international monetary fund was 
holding back nearly 300 million until pakistan improved its 
economic performance 
aziz said iraqs invasion of kuwait nearly four months ago was 
costing pakistan about 33 million a month 
sharif initially refused azizs request for price increases 
because most of pakistans 110 million people are landless laborers 
who earn less than 400 dollars a year 
pakistan is one of the largest recipients of international aid 
a total of about 3 billion a year some senior officials suggested 
the government might have to suspend payments on the debt but aziz 
said that was not being considered

hitting the bars of his cage 
porota is not the only solitary animal the zoo also has only 
one rhinoceros giraffe and elephant 
replacing animals was too expensive for municipal 
administrations that suffered inflation recession and near 
bankruptcy in recent years an elephant can cost 70000 and a 
rhino 150000 
when it opened 102 years ago the buenos aires zoo was an oasis 
of shady paths and exotic animals in the noise and pollution of a 
city that would grow to a population of 10 million 
now the grass is gone from many enclosures leaving only dust 
and concrete some buildings are boarded up and there are few 
attendants to remind visitors not to feed the animals try to catch 
them or poke them with sticks 
last month the city leased the zoo to gerardo sofovich a 
television host and animal lover who said he would invest 5 
million to buy new animals and spruce the place up 
among his plans are building an aquarium and conducting public 
education programs about animals and the outdoors 
some critics say sofovichs motives are more mercenary than 
philanthropic they claim his proposed admission fee of about 2 
would recoup his investment in a single year and effectively close 
the zoo to the poor 
sofovich doesnt want to improve the quality of life of 
the animals but rather enrich himself said raquel celoria who 
leads a neighborhood group opposed to the deal 
the association for the defense of animal rights believes the 
number of animals should be reduced by half rather than increased 
other opponents cite sofovichs friendship with president carlos 
menem and zoo director romero a former business partner in 
claiming favoritism 
romero responded those who are protesting now why didnt 
they do anything when the animals were starving 
people say stupid things sofovich commented its not as 
if were going to put in a disco like some people say we are 
going to do what governments could not because they didnt 
have the money

in his new album george carlin says hes never 
sure what he can say because of the federal communications 
commission the fcc once got cranky when a radio station played 
carlins album containing seven naughty words 
ergo he explains he has adopted his own policy about things he 
wont say 
he will not for instance say game plan role model 
happy camper lifestyle or moi and we will not 
maximize prioritize or finalize and we definitely will not 
spend any quallllity tiiiime 
be that as it may he thinks he spent quality time on working 
trash fox broadcastings first tv movie airing tonight 
carlin considers it quality time because the film promotes him 
from character player to costar as one of two wall street janitors 
who get rich by investing on information they find in company 
trash 
given the state of wall street today that would seem a sure way 
to oblivion no matter 
carlin 53 considers the costar part a step up he doesnt 
think its a bit late in the game for him 
it would be if id been chomping at the bit all this time 
said carlin who wears tshirts that say new york police bomb squad 
but speaks seriously in interviews at such times he doesnt play 
the foole as he likes to spell it 
i put my acting desires aside in the late 60s when i found i 
really wasnt very good at it he said it had been my plan 
from childhood to become a radio disc jockey then a standup 
comedian then a danny kaye bob hope or red skelton kind of actor 
but when i tried that i just lacked confidence 
in his defense carlins first time was in the marlo thomas 
sitcom that girl 
in recent years though matters have improved namely 
wellreceived character turns as rufus in bill and teds 
excellent adventure and the soused oldhippie guide of 
outrageous fortune 
whats nice about approaching it at this age is that i bring a 
lot more seasoning to my acting he said and it gives me a 
career to look forward to 
a new yorker carlin has lived in los angeles since 1966 as two 
generations of comics since have done he went to hollywood to grab 
the brass sitcom ring 
he was one of the early hipster comics a coffeehouse graduate 
a guy who loved wordplay still does and as the 60s heated 
up developed social and political edges to his humor 
a far cry from what some call brickwall comics the new 
wave of sitcom aspirants who wear black and usually appear on cable 
against a nightclubs brick wall discussing relationships 
flossing and los angeles freeways 
hes kindly if ambivalent about them even those who are 
somewhat to the left of whoopee they have at least a few minutes 
thats interesting and worthwhile and i find myself glad i hear 
that part 
arent they a little er blah though he shrugs well there 
are so many he said it comedy has become a cottage industry 
in a way its just the sheer numbers that would dictate a certain 
sameness 
despite all that he keeps working in comedy although in venues 
where he now for a nights work earns what one might call a 
bundle 
he does at least 110 concerts a year he said and has taped 
seven home box office specials and then there are the comedy 
albums last week he released his 14th its entitled parental 
advisory explicit lyrics 
the album has no lyrics technically speaking but does have a 
certain amount of raunch the title comes from the sticker some 
record labels put on their albums when the records are of 2 live 
crew nature 
i just thought using that sticker as the entire album label 
was the appropriate thing to do he said alluding to groups that 
have loudly protested what they call obscenity in rap and other 
kinds of music 
because as long as youre going to have to deal with these 
people you might as well mock them so the whole album is one 
large warning sticker 
carlin wasnt pressured to make his album cover a warning label 
he owns the company that made the album its called eardrum 
records 
he grinned 
our slogan he said is stick it in your ear 
 
elsewhere in television 
reasons no 396 and 3965 to continue breathing the syndicated 
the joan rivers show has been renewed for a third season an 
tonights edition of the syndicated geraldo will do sort of a 
the big chill number 
the series host geraldo rivera is devoting the entire show to 
his reflections on the 60s you know stuff like vietnam civil 
rights and the beatles he uses as a starting point his return to 
the university of arizona his alma mater for a 25th anniversary 
class reunion 
a press release on tonights show says viewers also will see the 
schools homecoming queen of 1965 the girl geraldo admired from

marc eisenson has an important message for 
americans do yourself your country and your grandchildren a big 
favor and pay a few more dollars on your monthly bills make it a 
habit 
the withering industrial base the federal deficit the savings 
and loan crisis and even saddam husseins invasion of kuwait make 
it more imperative than ever that americans get out of debt 
eisenson says 
it just makes it clear that future stability is not assured 
eisenson said of world events if i am out of debt i can weather 
a lot of storms 
americans owe 24 trillion in mortgage debt and another 729 
billion in consumer credit bills federal reserve figures show 
ironically those big mortgages provide many people with their 
greatest opportunity to save money 
according to eisenson no investment not treasury bonds not 
the stock market is more lucrative in the long run than simply 
spending money to retire debts that allows people to avoid 
interest payments that run around 20 percent on many credit cards 
if you were to bring your balance down its like earning 20 
percent with your money said eisenson twenty percent is more 
than donald trump can earn safely it is absolutely guaranteed 
riskfree and it is available to only those who are unfortunately 
or fortunately in debt 
eisenson calls his system debt management and insists it holds 
the key to happiness and financial security for millions of 
americans 
the concept is especially effective when applied to longterm 
debt such as mortgages paying a few dollars extra a month can 
take thousands of dollars and years off a typical mortgage 
at 10 percent a 75000 mortgage takes 30 years to pay and 
winds up costing the borrower a total of 237000 
by paying just 25 a month extra a person can save 34000 and 
take five years off the mortgage according to eisensons formula 
pay 100 a month extra and save 78000 and 12 years off the same 
mortgage 
get in the habit of debt management i dont care how strapped 
you are you can pay some money even an extra five or 10 
dollars said eisenson you can start the process to free 
yourself of debt with very little money the kind of money 
everybody has got 
eisenson said he learned his debtfree values from his parents 
who lived fairly simple lives his brother taught him how to apply 
those values to mortgages and he paid off a 30year mortgage in 
five years at age 27 a former electrical engineer eisenson 47 
has devoted the last fifteen years to developing his debt 
management system 
that system is spelled out in the bankers secret a 233page 
book published this year by villard books a division of random 
house before the book eisenson delivered his message through a 
constantly evolving booklet 
along with his partner nancy castleman eisenson has also 
developed a computer program to allow consumers to tailor 
prepayment plans to their individual needs 
were zealots we want to change the world we want to reach 
every homeowner in america with our message its just crazy to 
give 34000 or more to a bank when you could use that money to put 
kids through college or finance your retirement said castleman 
how many homeowners are there in this country with mortgages 
thats how many people we want to reach 
too many americans do not understand the mechanics of debt and 
how easily they can avoid thousands of dollars in interest by 
paying more than the minimum each month eisenson said 
most people just dont understand it is something they can 
really use eisenson said without making any significant 
change in the short term without going without people can 
dramatically change their lives in the long term 
lately people are more receptive to his message 
people are no longer in the spend generation he said 
many are in financial trouble or on the edge of it a lot of 
people really do begin to prepay and it makes a significant 
difference in their lives

two record companies cranking up the volume in 
the ongoing music censorship battle are asking music fans to buy 
new albums because of their explicit lyrics not in spite of them 
released just in time for holiday giftgiving two rap 
compilations are bound to reignite the furor over profane lyrics 
that surrounded 2 live crews trial last month on charges of 
performing obscene material at a florida nightclub the rap group 
was acquitted 
priority records says its explicit rap compilation was 
released for political reasons while organizers of reprise 
records 2 nasty 4 radio cited business motives 
the only difference between a cd of this stuff and cocaine is 
you cant fit it up your nose jack thompson the florida lawyer 
who crusaded against 2 live crew said of the new albums 
the new records have brought charges from within the rap 
community that some artists are just trying to cash in on a 
controversy that has made the front pages 
among the featured songs on explicit rap are 2 live crews 
me so horny and a handful of profanitylaced raps against the 
censorship movement on 2 nasty 4 radio a rapper in the number 
talk like sex brags that his sexual prowess will leave his 
partner looking like a rape victim 
the cover of explicit rap is a blownup version of the 
sticker that the recording industry devised this year to warn 
parents against explicit lyrics 
all profits from the albums sale will be donated to music 
critic dave marshs right to rock network an organization 
fighting censorship said priority spokeswoman lillian matulic 
its not just about cussing matulic said its a 
statement 
along with being intentionally provocative marsh said the album 
featuring artists like icet nwa the geto boys and ice cube 
contains some of the most exciting rock n roll being made 
today 
the new york city rap label cold chillin records which has a 
distribution deal with wea label reprise initially designed its 
compilation as a forum for new songs by its artists said tyrone 
williams cold chillin chairman wea suggested the 2 nasty 4 
radio concept he said 
williams said he tried to downplay the profanity asking rapper 
roxanne shante to change the name of her new song to brothers 
aint slick instead of the profane alternative shante refused 
but williams and rappers kool g rap and mc shan defended 2 
nasty 4 radio as giving consumers what they want in a package 
thats going to attract attention 
kids who attend his performances chant for his more obscene 
material shan said hes happy to oblige 
thats just us expressing what we see feel and how we do 
things they the fans love thumpin that in the jeeps in the 
cars 
jon shecter editor of the source a rap music magazine said 
the priority records compilation is the more valuable of the two 
musically but he said both albums represent blatant attempts to 
cash in on the controversy 
he said they would hurt the cause of rap music and predicted 
they wouldnt sell that well 
i dont think rap fans really want to hear that shecter 
said rap fans want to hear good music if it happens to have 
profanity on it thats part of the package 
thompson the lawyer who led the anti2 live crew crusade said 
he found these albums even more abhorrent than 2 live crews 
material because obscenity is the whole point of the records 
instead of a byproduct of the work 
he predicted that the record companies would face obscenity 
charges over the material and that anticensorship forces will 
regret picking a fight over these albums 
but marsh whose organization distributes pamphlets and 
organizes local anticensorship movements across the country said 
its important to have the showdown now 
its time to spit in the eye of the censors marsh said 
its time to stop acting timid and start being bold about what 
the real issue is the real issue is free speech 
every store that carries this record is making a statement 
that they know what the score is that they know the warning label 
is a joke its a front for censorship not some parental warning 
maybe in fact it ought to become a badge of honor

giuseppe tornatore remembers his low point 
a film on which he had worked for years closed after a few days 
producers were cool friends were politely suggesting a career 
change 
instead of committing suicide i wrote a new film he said 
laughing 
two years after that dark period the 34yearold tornatore is 
being hailed as italys hottest new director in a decade 
the film that flopped in 1988 cinema paradiso went on to 
win him an oscar in 1990 and the movie written in a moment of my 
life in which things were bad is being released in a moment in 
which things couldnt be better 
everything has gone so well said the grinning babyfaced 
director his eyes sparkling behind hornrimmed glasses im 
sorry there was so much delay 
two years after its dismal debut cinema paradiso is alive 
and well in italian cinemas and has drawn crowds in europe japan 
and the united states 
now the question is whether tornatore can succeed again and 
prove himself an heir to federico fellini bernardo bertolucci and 
other great italian directors 
his new film stanno tutti bene theyre all fine produced 
by angelo rizzoli has just been released in italy and is due to 
open in the united states in february 
it tells of an elderly mans journey through italy to visit his 
five widely scattered children whom he wants to reunite for a 
dinner 
the father played by marcello mastroianni is chagrined to 
discover that his children have drifted from him and have hidden 
their failures at work and in marriage 
i wanted to make a film about the difficulty there is today in 
personal communication said tornatore sipping mineral water in 
a cafe near his apartment by the vatican wall 
we live in an era of communication of mass media but the 
nearer we move to events the more difficult it is to communicate 
with people 
while the film displays tornatores keen eye for the italian 
character and for daytoday human comedy it is more melancholy 
than cinema paradiso a semiautobiographical tale of a child 
enraptured by the silver screen 
stanno tutti bene was written in a moment of my life in 
which things were bad i identified with the moods of people 
especially those who were suffering and also their failures 
tornatore said 
a movie buff who began making documentaries at age 20 tornatore 
already had two films to his credit la camorrista the 
camorra member and cinema paradiso 
but they made little money cinema paradiso a cherished 
personal project attracted little notice and quickly closed 
tornatore feared he would no longer be able to make his own films 
but then cinema paradiso won an award at the 1989 cannes 
film festival and returned to movie theaters it went on to become 
the first italian film to win best foreign film at the academy 
awards since fellinis amarcord in 1975 
i am happy because what happened was important he said he 
added however that now i dont have any more time not even 
to know if im fine or not 
the idea for theyre all fine came about four years ago when 
tornatore saw a dignified elderly man with a suitcase eating alone 
in a roman trattoria 
i thought to myself where is he going i invented the idea 
that he was searching for his kids 
the fathers personal saga has modern italy as its backdrop 
peopled by powerobsessed young professionals african immigrants 
sleeping in cardboard boxes and elderly parents closeted in 
retirement homes by their children 
tornatore who like the father comes from a sicilian town 
objects to an urban society that has allowed answering machines and 
television to eclipse human conservation 
i was conscious of the fact that during the day i call paris 
or tokyo or send faxes sometimes i make friendships by fax 
without ever seeing the persons face said tornatore then 
when i return home i dont know who lives next door the long 
distances have shrunk the small distances have become longer 
he said the films title sums up the gloss we use to cover the 
difficulties of modernday society 
its a phrase we say every day we are all always just too 
happy he said theres no one who says im not fine 
maybe its a world of hidden unhappiness maybe its easier to 
finish it there people prefer to say something uncomplicated 
its very symptomatic of this era

south africa faces economic 
problems that are intertwined with the blackwhite political 
conflict and may be as difficult to solve 
a yearold recession is expected to last through 1991 
unemployment is rising black shantytowns are expanding and whites 
are joining the lines at soup kitchens 
economics has become a major part of the debate on south 
africas future 
government officials and most other whites say capitalism is the 
quickest route to prosperity for all the african national congress 
and other antiapartheid groups particularly labor unions favor 
socialism and demand a major redistribution of the wealth 
controlled by whits 
the economic debate is likely to become a great deal more 
heated if south africa shifts to longterm stagflation said 
business day the countrys leading financial daily the merits 
of a market economy are less obvious when a stagnant economy is 
accompanied by ever rising prices south africas economy is the 
strongest and most diverse on an impoverished continent but is 
expected to shrink about 2 percent this year and not to grow in 
1991 
with the population increasing at more than 2 percent a year 
president fw de klerk says the economy needs at least 5 percent 
annual growth if living conditions for blacks are to improve 
substantially 
as the economy declines black expectations are rising with de 
klerks political reforms and his promise to dismantle the 
apartheid system of racial segregation 
blacks in south africa have long equated apartheid with 
capitalism and many expect a new political system to bring major 
economic changes for many blacks that means socialism despite its 
failure in eastern europe and elsewhere in africa 
annual per capita income for south african blacks is equivalent 
to more than 1000 making it one of africas highest figures but 
only a fraction of what the average south african white earns 
no accurate unemployment figures are available but private 
economists say the rate is at least 15 percent for blacks and that 
20 percent to 30 percent more are underemployed in the southern 
city of port elizabeth black unemployment is almost 50 percent 
operation hunger which feeds needy blacks in rural areas 
estimates it is helping 15 million people up from about 1 million 
at the start of 1990 
we are getting more requests for help than ever before said 
bernie cohen financial director of the 10yearold organization 
john rees who runs the methodist care food distribution project 
in johannesburg said growing numbers of whites are losing their 
jobs and seeking assistance 
de klerks government recently conceded that the black housing 
shortage a perennial crisis is getting worse as 1 million blacks 
a year move to cities in search of work about 7 million of the 
countrys 30 million blacks already live in shacks they built 
themselves private groups report 
the government speaks of spending more to improve black living 
conditions but supports a huge bureaucracy created by apartheid 
about one of every three working whites is employed by the 
government much of the bureaucracy is duplicated in a system that 
has separate branches for whites blacks asains and people of 
mixed race plus separate structures in the 10 black homelands 
strikes by black workers have increased as unions demand higher 
wages from white managements accustomed to cheap labor gold 
mining for example faces a combination of rapidly rising costs 
and a stagnant world price 
south africa is the worlds largest producer of gold which 
provides more than 40 percent of its export earnings but many of 
its mines are among the worlds deepest and most expensive to 
operate 
gold is hovering at about 380 an ounce on world markets the 
magazine financial mail said the industry will continue to 
battle as long as the price stays under 400 and this will 
ripple through the economy as recession deepens 
an estimated 31000 of the 500000 workers in gold mining have 
lost their jobs in the past year and about 15 mines are in 
financial trouble according to the chamber of mines an umbrella 
group of leading companies 
foreign economic sanctions imposed because of apartheid also 
have hurt but no one can say exactly how much 
sanctions have shut off loans from internatonal lending 
agencies and more than half of the 300 us companies that did 
business in south africa five years ago have left 
the anc the main black opposition group wants sanctions to 
continue as a way to keep pressure on the government but plans to 
review its policy in light of de klerks reforms and the worsening 
economy

maybe columbus didnt really 
discover america the locals met him on the beach but he brought 
a hedge against cholesterol 500 years before everybody started 
worrying about it 
argentine ranchers believe criollos descendants of the hardy 
cattle columbus carried across the sea can be the basis of new 
crossbreeds that will produce leaner steaks for a dietconscious 
age 
columbus brought the first cattle to the new world on his 
second voyage in 1493 and more on his third and fourth trips 
said dr sol l rabasa a genetecist 
you can accurately say the animals that subsequently populated 
the americas from the texas longhorn in the north to what we call 
criollo cattle in latin america are their direct descendants 
rabasa is president of the 6yearold argentine criollo cattle 
breeders association which is rescuing criollos from 
nearextinction and breeds them on his ranch near villa canas 185 
miles west of buenos aires 
he said the criollo and its crossbreeds convert food to muscle 
efficiently and produce leaner meat with less marbled fat 
the spanish word criollo is used throughout latin america to 
denote people or animals born in the americas of european 
parentage 
despite nearly five centuries of independent development rabasa 
said the texas longhorn and argentine criollo have the same long 
angular shorthaired body and the same colors brown red or 
piebald 
carlos e dawney a rancher and association officer said the 
only real difference is in the horns that give the texas breed its 
name often 60 inches from tip to tip longer than ours 
rabasa believes columbus chose the cattle from the arid regions 
near spains southern ports selecting animals that were gentle 
for easy handling and hardy to stand the long trip in cramped 
quarters 
they were used to establish breeding herds on cuba and hispanola 
in the caribbean from there they were taken to mexico the 
isthmus of panama and to peru for distribution through spains 
south american colonies 
criollos arrived in argentina in the mid1500s and soon 
multiplied into tens of thousands on the pampa one of the worlds 
finest natural grazing lands 
argentina exported hides but there was no way to preserve meat 
for export and most of it was left to rot 
faster ships and use of salt as a preservative made ranching 
highly profitable by the 1830s to boost production cattlemen 
imported such fastergrowing british breeds as the hereford 
shorthorn and aberdeen angus 
zebu breeds from india slowgrowing and tough but resistant to 
heat and disease were introduced in semitropical northern 
argentina 
soon the criollo was seen as inferior and began to disappear 
absorbed by the herds of newcomers or banished to the least 
hospitable areas 
rabasa 75 is a former university rector noted for research he 
became interested in the criollos potential 20 years ago when 
ranchers asked him about the possibility of crossing it with zebu 
cattle 
i had to tell them i didnt know and we set out to find some 
evidence he said in an interview 
a herd of zebucriollo crossbreeds was discovered on a ranch in 
northwest chaco province and we found their production levels 
and meat quality were surprisingly good rabasa said 
years of research by rabasa and the national institute of 
agricultural technology followed crossing the criollo with zebu 
and british breeds 
studies showed the criollo still had the gentleness prized by 
columbus combined with superior fertility body structure that 
facilitates calving resistance to disease and good milk 
production rabasa said 
the criollo calf gets up as soon as it is born and begins to 
drink its mothers milk allowing the mother to pass more of her 
protective antibodies on to the calf during the first 24 hours 
he said the other breeds are slower to react and their calves 
receive fewer antibodies 
skin and eye pigmentation protect criollos and their crossbreeds 
from cancers conjunctivitis and other ailments provoked by the 
bright sunlight prevalent in much of the americas the geneticist 
said 
criollos also need water less often and can spend more time 
searching for food over a larger area making them ideal for 
marginal land 
rabasa and his associates began a search for pure criollos 
remaining in argentina 
they found them in pockets of the arid thornforested chaco and 
in la rioja a desert province a wild herd turned up in the 
glaciers national park of southern patagonias andean foothills 
about 185 miles from the strait of magellan 
registered criollo cattle now number between 1000 and 2000 and 
about 50 commercial herds use them as breeding stock 
rabasa said efforts to preserve criollo cattle are under way in 
other countries including the united states where a gread deal 
is being done

la asunta bolivia ap the coca boom is over and armando 
chavez is learning to grow something else 
chavez an aymara indian is one of thousands of farmers in this 
remote andean region who are making the transition to coffee 
fruit soybeans and other crops with the help of a un project 
he said the program is like a dream to us now we have 
advisers fertilizer and insecticies they have introduced 
soybeans built schools and roads if the project left the area we 
would be like orphans 
the un project is the cornerstone of a bolivian government 
effort to wean farmers away from coca the base of cocaine 
our purpose is to change the illicit economy created by the 
cocacocaine axis and enable farmers to diversify their crops 
oswaldo antezana undersecretary of the interior for alternative 
development said in an interview before farmers were 
antagonistic 
chavez 39 his wife and four children live in an adobe hut on a 
treecovered hill outside la asunta a town of dirt streets and 
more tinroofed adobe huts it is near the yungas a cocaproducing 
region in the subtropical andean foothills east of la paz 
a fourwheeldrive vehicle needs seven hours to cover the 150 
miles from la paz to la asunta the narrow road runs along sheer 
cliffs hundreds of feet above cascading rivers that feed the 
amazon 
farmers get from the road to fields across the chasms in 
makeshift conveyances suspended from cables many of them suffer 
from yellow fever or tuberculosis 
when the cocaine boom began in the late 1970s coca production 
spread from the yungas to la asunta 
migrants from the highlands and the yungas moved in cleared the 
forests and planted coca for sale to traffickers the area became a 
no mans land where outsiders particular police were not welcome 
chavez moved to la asunta 11 years ago hoping coca would 
improve his lot then coca prices started down two years ago and he 
decided to call it quits because there is a law requiring the 
reduction of coca and we cannot live only from coca 
when prices dropped below the cost of production it wasnt 
even worth harvesting the leaf he said 
prices were driven down in part because of the colombian 
governments crackdown on cocaine traffickers last year and 
increased interdiction activities in bolivia 
chavez heads one of the seven community development centers in 
la asunta that receive financial and technical support from the 
un project his center is introducing the raising of pigs and 
fish and the cultivation of coffee soybeans spices and fruit 
veterinarians agronomists and health workers assist farmers 
through the centers 
jairo morales nieto chief tecnical adviser on the un project 
said the centers are involved in product development production 
and marketing as well as in training the farmers 
in contrast to many other rural areas in latin america in 
bolivia there is a remarkably organized peasant social base and 
peasant organizations have worked effectively for their members 
interests he said 
farmers get a credit of 2000 for every hectare about 2 
acres of coca they destroy loans seeds and fertilizer are 
provided as farmers progress in planting new crops and raising 
animals 
because one of the main problems in remote regions has been 
getting products to market the un project has financed new 
roads 
two years ago it took eight hours in good weather to travel 
between la asunta and chulumani a market town about 70 miles to 
the south and longer in the rain now it takes three hours 
the un fund for drug abuse control has spent 21 million on 
the project which has helped 150000 farmers since it began in 
1985 the money runs out this year but the government hopes for an 
extension 
as long as coca cultivation increases in the region there is 
a greater possibility of cocaine traffickers and violence moving 
in said arturo villanueva an adviser who showed visitors 
experimental shrimp tanks financed by the project 
an estimated 125000 acres are devoted to coca cultivation in 
bolivia the government hopes to cut that to about 30000 which is 
considered sufficient for the leafs traditional applications 
coca is used as a medicine in religious rituals as a tea and 
is chewed by farmers and miners to help counteract the effects of 
high altitude and hunger 
twothirds of bolivian coca is grown in the chapare a flat 
tropical region east of la asunta both the united nations and 
united states are financing alternative development programs there 
but with less success than in la asunta 
bolivian farmers have destroyed a record 20 percent of the 
countrys coca crop since october 1989 
we have learned to establish a clear distinction between the 
peasants and the drug dealers said morales nieto the un 
technical adviser generally the peasants want to abide by the 
law

artisans are recreating one of the great 
moments of archaeology on an island south of cairo 
on nov 26 1922 english archaeologist howard carter opened the 
tomb of the boy pharaoh tutankhamun and found a glittering world of 
delicate statues inlaid chests featherlight fans and decorated 
coffins of solid gold 
the riches he discovered amazed the world 
now 68 years after carter peered into the small tomb in 
southern egypt the artisans are fashioning tuts netherworld once 
again working from photographs and other records the replicas of 
tuts treasures are to be entombed as the archaeologist saw them 
twentytwo artists sculptors engineers and university students 
are rekindling craftsmanship unseen since the days of the pharaohs 
they are halfway through their assignment to duplicate his 
fourchambered tomb and 1000 of the 1703 tut objects in the 
egyptian museum as they were left by priests 3313 years ago and 
the robbers who came later 
everwatchful jackals goddesses in sleek gowns openmouthed 
lions and even the boy pharaoh himself out for a walk in thonged 
sandals cram the bustling workshop on jacobs island 
a year from now every day on jacobs island will be nov 26 
1922 
until then people wanting to marvel at king tuts storied world 
must travel to the two places they have visited for decades the 
treasure hoard in cairos egyptian museum and his tomb with the 
mummy 450 miles to the south in the valley of the kings 
its the wonder that we must produce in our tomb the shock 
which you dont feel when you see the objects away from the tomb 
said mahmoud mabrouk a sculptor and art professor who directs the 
jacobs island project 
we work as a team just as the ancients did he said 
novices think tuts treasures were all of solid gold there was 
plenty of that but there also were objects of wood silver and 
other metals alabaster ivory leopard skins leather pottery and 
gemstones 
decisions on whether to replicate individual items big or 
small were based on whether they were important to history or to 
art knowledge 
the project is costing 1 million egyptian pounds almost 
360000 and is the brainchild of former diplomat hassan ragab an 
entrepreneur who revived egypts extinct papyrus industry 
in 1985 he opened his pharaonic village on jacobs island where 
tourists come to view life from the days of king tut but without 
the boy pharaoh himself 
dr ragab asked me to create a fullscale tomb with exact 
copies of objects so that tourists would feel the wonder as carter 
felt it mabrouk said the tomb was no problem but nobody knew 
how to make the objects everybody i talked with told me to refuse 
the offer 
mabrouk who advises an international committee working to save 
the sphinx said he accepted the challenge for two reasons 
first i wanted to enter the mind of the ancient artist he 
said what kind of people were these to create things so 
beautiful but things that would never be seen by the living 
today we artists have exhibitions and everybody congratulates 
us not these artists their creations were locked up with tut 
the second reason harks back to mabrouks childhood 
i was 12 when my brother and i saw the tut collection in the 
museum he said we were so happy but we were sad the objects 
were beautiful but nobody knew anything about them 
i want egyptian youth to look back on their history with a 
sense of pride a sense of identity its an arab problem that 
egyptians turn their backs on anything about the pharaohs 
mabrouk said he is astounded by the quality of tut relics we 
had to start with the simplest items he said once we mastered 
the techniques we could tackle the most difficult 
reproduction has been made more difficult because objects in the 
museum must be examined from behind glass and many tut objects are 
locked in storerooms books contain conflicting information and 
mabrouk said many of carters notes are inaccurate 
even lowly artifacts proved tricky a simple pair of sandals 
took three months to reproduce 
many of the 50 alabaster items from the tomb were lovingly 
worked with exquisite designs alabaster posed one of the toughest 
challenges 
we spent six months working in alabaster factories outside the 
valley of the kings just to see how to use the stone mabrouk 
said we finally made three simple vases but even that took a 
month 
still to come are tutankhamuns gold death mask and the 
elaborately inlaid gold sarcophagus 
sometimes you just have to compromise mabrouk said well 
use goldplated copper instead of gold but the effect will be the 
same

a running news story became an entry for the 
history books this past week when a federal judge sentenced 
junkbond financier michael milken to 10 years in prison 
even though the former master of the universe for drexel burnham 
lambert inc probably will serve only a fraction of the term the 
severity of the judges pronouncement punctuated the milken tale 
with an exclamation point 
there should be no doubt in anyones mind nor in the minds of 
those who study his case years from now that this was a stunning 
comeuppance 
a man who had been portrayed by some as the most influential 
financial figure of modern times got more jail time than some 
hardened criminals 
the unmistakable message from us district judge kimba wood 
just two years older than the 44yearold milken was that 
whitecollar crime should not pay 
milken made more than 1 billion peddling highyield junk bonds 
for drexel and remains among the countrys richest people even 
after paying 600 million in fines and restitution as part of his 
plea agreement to six felony charges 
despite his wealth the manhattan courtroom scene reduced the 
largerthanlife milken to more human proportions it proved a 
strange ending to an era of excess in the financial world 
once milken found himself in the company of adoring elders in 
the highest ranks of corporate america as he charted a course for 
restructuring companies with huge amounts of debt on wednesday he 
was humbled in front of a contemporary judge who said he had 
misused his leadership position and should be removed from 
society 
as the case was debated before and after the sentencing milken 
was alternately praised by supporters as a wizard and blamed by 
detractors for everything from drexels own collapse to the recent 
downturn in the economy 
but judge woods sentence struck with a force that diluted the 
celebrity and left just a man who would leave a wife and a family 
and go to prison next march 
milken was not vindicated as he had hoped he would be and the 
decade of greed that he symbolized seemed to be banished to the 
dark past

it was a light but characteristically depressing week for 
economic reports the government said home building plunged 6 
percent in october extending the slide in the construction 
business to nine months the longest on record 
housing starts have sunk to the lowest level since the last 
recession in 1982 analysts said the industry was battered from two 
sides by sagging consumer confidence and tight credit many said 
the malaise would linger well into 1991 
with the evidence of recession rising so did the rhetoric from 
washington treasury secretary nicholas f brady urged regulators 
not to overreact to the softening economy by discouraging banks 
from making reasonable loans 
use some judgment apply some balance he implored bank 
examiners 
meanwhile president bushs chief economist michael boskin 
exercised some damage control of his own after his boss used the 
word downturn to describe the economys shape boskin allowed 
that current conditions were sluggish but he said it would be 
premature to declare a recession 
there was no denying a recession on wall street however the 
securities industry association said profits in the business 
totaled an anemic 200 million in the first six months of 1990 and 
have deteriorated since 
the trade group said the sum was not equivalent to a single 
decent bond issue a few years ago

the nations seventhlargest accounting firm laventhol amp 
horwath sought refuge in bankrupcty court under fire from lawsuits 
seeking damages from dissatisfied clients 
robert levine the firms executive partner and chief executive 
officer said the chapter 11 filing was prompted by a series of 
tragic circumstances 
among them was a 30 million payment to creditor banks last year 
of which only 185 million was covered by insurance over an 
audit for the grabill corp of chicago laventhol audits of jim 
bakkers ptl ministry also ended up in court in north carolina 
the firms problems were among the most severe in an industry 
increasingly plagued by malpractice litigation laventhol said some 
of its partners would continue servicing clients independently to 
help pay off debts 
in another chapter 11 case greyhound lines inc filed a plan of 
reorganization with a texas court that would erase the equity of 
the current owners and issue new stock to the firms unsecured 
creditors the plan also promised full repayment of secured bank 
debt real estate mortgages and bus leases 
but the bus line must still satisfy its drivers who have been 
on strike since march and have protested their treatment to the 
national labor relations board the drivers could propose a 
reorganization plan of their own 
cbs inc said it expected a loss in the fourth quarter and lower 
earnings in 1991 the broadcasting company blamed the deteriorating 
picture on the poor advertising climate and disappointing returns 
from its expensive venture into sports programming 
the disclosure of the projected loss came just before the 
network went before affiliates to propose a reduction in the amount 
of money it will pay local stations to carry national programming

a plan was proposed for restructuring the finances of the 
manville trust to try to meet claims by thousands of americans made 
sick by working with asbestos 
the plan was aimed at resolving the funds cash crisis and 
breaking a logjam of asbestos claims in the courts it proposes to 
pump up the fund with more money and pay the neediest cases first 
asbestos once considered a miracle fiber caused thousands of 
deaths from lung cancer and other ailments the resulting lawsuits 
sent several companies into bankruptcy court and clogged court 
dockets nationwide 
the 25 billion manville trust was set up after manville corp 
once the leading producer of asbestos reorganized under bankruptcy 
court supervision in 1988 already the trust has paid more than 
11 billion to settle about 23000 claims but faces another 
130000 cases 
the restructuring plan which must be reviewed by a judge and 
will likely be appealed requires manville corp to provide an 
additional 520 million to the fund over seven years claimants 
would be paid based on the severity of their illnesses 
lawyers fees one of the most controversial elements of the 
asbestos issue would be capped at 25 percent of their clients 
settlements

by the time the current economic downturn runs 
its course some wall street analysts contend it could shake up 
the way many people think about american investments 
for example they suggest just suppose that recession and a 
change in attitudes toward the use of credit bring about a 
longlasting decline in interest rates 
bonds might lose their modern image as volatile securities and 
return to something at least a little like the slowandstodgy days 
of yore 
real estate even with lower mortgage interest rates might 
emerge lacking some of the luster it acquired over the past two 
decades as a prime beneficiary of an inflationdriven economy 
moneymarket mutual funds treasury bills and other shortterm 
interestbearing investments could also fade from their present 
exalted status as their yields declined 
as for stocks well just possibly they could flourish 
provided the business world was able to find and develop important 
new sources of growth 
of course all this is conjecture akin to a longrange weather 
forecast based on a series of assumptions and interpretations that 
have not yet been tested by the course of realworld events 
the prospect of a sustained drop in interest rates by itself is 
far from an accepted idea 
still visions of this sort serve at least one present purpose 
challenging any presumptions that the nation is simply going 
through a down cycle that will reliably give way sooner or later to 
a return of businessasbefore on wall street 
we argue that todays recession will complete the job that 
began at the outset of the 1980s says robert j barbera 
economist at shearson lehman brothers inc in a current appraisal 
of the outlook 
inflation collapsed after the economic downturns early in the 
decade but inflation psychology lingered debt usage a bet that 
inflation would return thrived despite low inflation 
high real shortterm interest rates were necessary to contain 
us economic growth in a debtaddicted society today however 
both borrowers and lenders are much more circumspect about the use 
of debt 
signs of at least a shortterm drop in rates have lifted 
investors spirits of late although that mood of optimism seemed 
to be on hold in the past week 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials closed friday at 
252723 down 2302 points from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index slipped 91 to 
17239 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
dropped 181 to 34904 and the american stock exchange market 
value index was down 162 at 29590 
in holidaydampened activity volume on the big board averaged 
12653 million shares a day down from 16355 million the week 
before 
to some observers such as the economists s jay levy and david 
levy in chappaqua ny it wont be easy to get us business 
growing vigorously again even on the far side of the recession 
the excesses of the 1980s are being paid for in the 1990s 
the levys declare a decades profligacy cannot be overcome 
quickly 
says barbera we completely agree with the idea that the 
30year debt cycle is ending and that attitudes about borrowing and 
lending are going through a metamorphosis 
but we are also confident that at some point interest rate 
declines will rekindle both borrowing and building before recession 
turns into depression 
debts demise promises an end to the artificially high real 
shortterm interest rates witnessed in the 1980s he concludes 
longterm financial assets stocks and bonds will thrive in an 
environment of sharply lower rates

while the demise of junk bond financier michael 
milken symbolizes an era gone sour his cooperation with 
prosecutors could lead to another round of highprofile wall street 
cases lawyers said 
us district judge kimba wood who sentenced milken to an 
unexpectedly harsh 10 years in prison and three years probation 
held open the possibility of reducing the term to reward 
cooperation 
milken associates said thursday that the exhead of junk bond 
trading at drexel burnham lambert inc whose ideas about debt 
reshaped us corporate finance in the 1980s was devastated by the 
sentence 
milken 44 and his wife lori returned to their home in the 
encino suburb of los angeles shortly after the sentencing wednesday 
in manhattan federal court they were said to be spending 
thanksgiving at home with their three children aged 17 14 and 9 
defense lawyers for milkn subordinates at drexel said they 
believed the judge gave a stiff term partly to send a message about 
the value of helping the government 
she is communicating clearly to michael and his attorneys that 
if she is going to entertain the possibility of reducing sentence 
he must completely and totally cooperate said aubrey harwell 
jr who represented a former drexel trader who received immunity 
from prosecution and testified against milken 
the sentence if no reduction occurs effectively means milken 
will spend a minimum of nearly seven years in jail and on 
probation denying him complete freedom until at least sometime in 
1998 
in a deal pleading guilty to six felony counts milken agreed to 
respond truthfully to any questions posed by the government after 
sentencing 
lawyers involved in the case said they expected prosecutors to 
target corporate officials who dealt with milken 
one of the topics of conversation in the last 24 hours is that 
if michael completely and totally cooperates and provides 
information on corporate chieftains connected to his work this 
sentence will be significantly reduced said one defense lawyer 
who asked not to be named 
the lawyer said he believe the government would start out by 
gently pushing him push him harder and harder and bring more 
pressure to bear 
milkens sentence is far stricter than any previous in wall 
streets corruption scandals which evolved largely from 
information supplied by speculator ivan boesky who received a 
threeyear prison term after settling insider trading charges 
dennis levine a former drexel investment banker got two years 
after agreeing to return 126 million in illegal gains from 
trading on inside information mergers specialist martin siegel 
who accepted suitcases of cash in exchange for inside information 
spent two months in prison 
the main difference between those cases and milkens legal 
experts agreed is the three cooperated before sentencing which 
judges consider a mitigating factor and milken didnt 
judge wood said in a subtle way that boesky cooperated and 
you didnt how can you expect to get a sentence thats equal to 
his said harry first a law professor at new york university 
milken was involved in thousands of financings mergers and 
other transactions and the government is known to have been 
scrutinizing several deals first said milken and his attorneys now 
must decide how much to help prosecutors 
martin klein a new york lawyer and friend of milkens called 
woods offer of a sentence reduction in return for good cooperation 
coercive 
that assumes that he has anything to say klein said this 
whole idea of getting people to turn on others sets a bad precedent 
in this country 
milken must report to federal custody next march no prison was 
designated but under federal guidelines milken initially could not 
go to a minimumsecurity camp because of the length of his term 
legal experts said he likely will be eligible for parole upon 
serving onethird of his term during probation wood required 
1800 hours of community service a year or 346 hours a week 
milkens lawyers have 120 days to appeal the sentence through a 
motion seeking reduction a milken spokesman would not say whether 
a decision had been made milken had faced a maximum 28 years 
since milkens crimes occurred before 1987 his sentencing was 
not based on federal guidelines that specify punishment but two 
factors cited by the judge meriting a longer sentence under the 
guidelines were milkens position of authority and the commission 
of crimes she said were hard to detect 
wood told the court anothr component of her decision was 
milkens behavior after boeskys november 1986 plea deal with 
authorities 
she said milken didnt directly order subordinates to destroy or 
remove documents but communicated the advisability of their doing 
so in subtle terms that preserved some deniability on your part 
wood said she did not accept government charges at a 
presentencing hearing last month that milken committed insider 
trading or manipulated a particular stock that made the long 
prison term more shocking to associates 
she found for us on those issues said a friend of milkens 
who asked not to be named if she found against us what would she 
have done twentyeight years

to 23 percent from 25 percent predicted in august 
it also revised the inflation rate to 97 percent from 95

eleven staterun coal mines will 
be closed over the next two years under efforts to streamline 
moneylosing industries the government says 
economics minister vladimir dlouhy said thursday that about 
9500 workers will be laid off at the mines located mostly in the 
ostrava region about 240 miles east of prague 
dlouhy said the mines are unprofitable but have been kept open 
to supply coalfired electric power stations 
two major power stations and several smaller generators face 
shutdown over the same twoyear period to reduce pollution dlouhy 
said 
the 750megawatt power shortfall resulting from the closures 
would be covered by an expanding nuclear power program he said 
czechoslovakia already has two sovietdesigned nuclear plants in 
operation and two under construction 
a 440megawatt reactor at the new mohovce station is scheduled 
to start up in 1991 and a 1000megawatt installation is slated to 
begin operating in 1992 at temelin a new plant near the austrian 
border 
workers from the closed power stations will be relocated or 
retrained dlouhy said 
miners in north moravia have been on strike alert all week 
demanding better social conditions for themselves and their 
families 
dlouhy said the mines and power stations would not be 
dismantled and could be reopened quickly if needed 
czechoslovakia and other east european nations are bracing for a 
harsh winter because of reduced soviet oil imports and higher crude 
oil prices following the persian gulf crisis 
regular annual imports of 16 million tons of soviet oil are 
expected to drop to 12 million tons next year

capital gains tax an issue which helped provoke a stock traders 
strike earlier this week but postponed implementation for two

the federal reserve has allowed shortterm 
interest rates to fall moderately but tight lending practices and 
depressed bank earnings could delay the moves effect on the 
economy 
normally lower shortterm interest rates take about a month to 
show up in a lower prime rate lower adjustable rate mortgages and 
cheaper car loans economists said it might take another year to 
18 months for lending activity to increase as more consumers decide 
to buy new houses and cars 
but interest rates are only one element of credit 
availability theres a credit crunch and homebuilders are having 
trouble getting financing said bob villanueva chief economist 
at the national association of home builders 
the federal reserve this past week confirmed what many borrowers 
already knew banks under pressure from regulators have become 
reluctant to make loans their caution has been chiefly aimed at 
commercial real estate borrowers but has also affected typically 
safe large corporations and home buyers 
bankers and business owners complain that regulators are 
overreacting to the savings and loan debacle and discouraging banks 
from making reasonable loans 
the bush administration wants lower interest rates to mean 
easier credit 
treasury secretary nicholas brady this past week urged bank 
examiners not to discourage banks from making loans 
also an interest rate cut could move through the economy more 
slowly if banks try to bolster their weak earnings by delaying a 
cut in the prime rate and absorbing the lower federal funds rate 
the lower fed funds rate without a corresponding cut in the prime 
increases the spread between the price banks pay for money and what 
they charge to lend it 
another source of money for banks certificates of deposit have 
yet to come down much 
moreover some doubt the fed has allowed shortterm rates to 
fall enough and say it should move more aggressively to 
significantly strengthen the economy 
the economy which is certainly very sluggish right now is 
not going to burst out of the shoot because the fed allowed the fed 
funds rate to come down 25 hundredths of a percentage point in the 
past few days said ken goldstein an economist at the conference 
board 
in 25 basispoint increments the fed has lowered the federal 
funds rate the interest banks charge each other for overnight 
loans twice in recent months from 8 percent to 7 percent 
if the 50 basis point drop in the federal funds rate is 
translated into a half percentage point drop in the prime rate the 
effects could trickle into consumer loans within weeks goldstein 
said 
but for businesses to spring back to life and lead a resurgence 
in economic growth is just whistling in the dark he said 
if the lower interest rates find their way to a lower prime rate 
and is accompanied by easier lending practices by banks a half 
percentage point cut could lead to about 40000 new housing units 
in a quarter villanueva said 
but a more meaningful and aggressive move to lower rates rather 
than allowing them to fall would be difficult for the fed 
the dollar already has weakened severely on world currency 
markets and if us interest rates fall further without 
corresponding drops in japan and germany the dollar would weaken 
more

ameritrust corp expecting a loss for the 
year announced friday it had halved the dividend on the banking 
companys common stock 
officials said they resorted to the cut the first in the 
companys 96year history mainly because of problem loans linked 
to a lagging commercial real estate market 
the ameritrust board of directors declared a quarterly dividend 
of 16 cents per common share down from 32 cents per share in the 
third quarter the dividend is payable dec 10 to stockholders of 
record dec 3 
the boards decision to reduce the dividend on the common 
stock was prudent in view of our expectations for financial 
performance in the nearterm and general economic conditions 
said craig r smith chairman and chief executive of ameritrust 
for the first nine months of 1990 ameritrust reported a loss of 
19 million smith did not say how large the fourthquarter loss 
was expected to be 
ameritrust spokeswoman terry taylor said smiths recommendation 
to cut the dividend was prompted by the size of this years loss 
and was a part of an overall effort to cut costs 
ameritrust has more than 200 commercial banking offices in ohio 
indiana and michigan and a major trust subsidiary in dallas

with not much else to cheer about in the 
economic news wall street has grown much more optimistic in recent 
weeks about the inflation outlook 
in the forefront of the financial news oil prices have fallen 
of late from the peaks they reached after iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait but beyond that analysts see other trends they describe as 
even more heartening 
some broad indexes of industrial commodity prices actually 
reached their peaks for the year before the oil upsurge 
in recent weeks these gauges of inflationary pressures have 
declined steadily to their lowest levels since late last winter 
the inflation picture is becoming less worrisome said jack 
lavery director of global research at merrill lynch amp co energy 
price increases are abating and are not spreading elsewhere the 
economy is too weak 
amid this kind of encouragement anxious talk about 
stagflation has died down in the financial world 
a few months ago concern was rising that the economy was headed 
for a spell of double trouble little or no growth combined with 
persistent upward pressure on the cost of living 
operating under that script the federal reserve would have 
hardly any maneuvering room to try to counter either problem since 
a stimulative policy to counteract recession would only make 
inflation worse while a militant antiinflation stand would deepen 
the economic slump 
now that perceived dilemma seems to have been resolved most 
analysts agree that ebbing inflation has made it possible for the 
fed to adopt a less stringent approach in managing the supply of 
money and credit in the economy 
the shift has been cautious and gradual reflecting a style that 
has become familiar to fedwatchers under the chairmanship of alan 
greenspan 
the central bank has made no move as yet to change the discount 
rate which has stood at 7 percent since it was raised to that 
level on feb 24 1989 in the past the fed has often used changes 
in the discount rate the charge it sets on loans to private 
financial institutions to signal important monetarypolicy moves 
in many analysts view greenspan has been sticking with a 
deliberate style in an effort to gain and keep the confidence of 
bond traders that he wont let his guard down on inflation 
the letup in inflation fears has helped to ease what some 
observers view as a simplistic initial reaction to the sharp rise 
in oil prices 
even if we knew for sure at what level oil prices will settle 
the consequences are not as predictable as might be imagined 
said economists at hc wainwright amp co of boston in a recent 
report on the subject 
inflation is a monetary phenomenon they argue no single 
commodity can drive the prices of all commodities up only the 
federal government by depreciating the value of the currency can 
do that 
indeed an energy price increase works the other way by 
absorbing a larger slice of the incomes of energy users it makes 
the existing prices of other commodities less affordable 
if however government intervenes to ratify or monetize 
an oil price increase then inflation will result

raul gardini the chemical tycoon who 
advocates privatizing italys industry is selling his stake in 
enimont and leaving the troubled chemical joint venture to the 
statecontrolled energy group eni 
gardini who had long sought to extend his control on italys 
chemical business through a takeover of enimont said thursday he 
would sell his 40 percent stake for about 255 billion to italys 
state energy group 
the stock is being sold to ente nazionale idrocarburi also 
known as eni 
eni already owns 40 percent of enimont its bid to buy 
montedisons 40 percent stake and increase its holding to a 
controlling 80 percent ended a bitter 18month battle between 
gardini and eni officials 
eni also offered to buy out minority shareholders to take 
complete control of enimont 
gardini meanwhile announced his resignation as chairman of 
ferruzzi finanziaria the key holding company of the 
agroindustrial and chemical groups of the ferruzzi family 
a statement said gardini was leaving for ideological reasons 
and would no longer participate in any italian company or 
business organization

restructure italys chemical industry creating the worlds 10th 
largest chemical group with annual revenue of about 136 billion 
but squabbling over industrial strategy and managerial control 
doomed the effort

the government said friday it would end 
production of the boxey little car fondly called a trabi that was 
the staple of former east germanys auto industry 
about 10000 trabant cars will be delivered to poland under an 
existing agreement with the former east german government the 
german economics ministry added in a statement 
the tiny trabant made of fiberglass is almost comic in 
comparison with the mighty mercedesbenz and bmw that race down 
germanys autobahns the trabants top speed is around 62 mph 
trabis became famous when east german refugees drove them into 
bavaria as formerly closed borders began opening in september 1989 
they were also used by east germans who fled into west berlin the 
night of nov 9 1989 when the berlin wall was breached 
many former west germans have bought used trabis as keepsakes of 
their former easern neighbors while former east germans have 
purchased more luxurious western models

oil prices shot up more than 2 a barrel friday 
as traders who were worrying about war in the persian gulf became 
even more jittery over a threat of violence in the soviet union 
the worlds largest oil producer 
gorbachev warned of bloodshed if the republics of the soviet 
union broke up said annlouise hittle a senior oil analyst with 
shearson lehman brothers inc 
the soviet presidents comments made at a moscow news 
conference fueled the upward surge in a market that opened bullish 
in response to oil prices that had risen thursday in london on news 
of a shutdown at a north sea oil facility she said 
the facility was already being brought back online friday but 
the higher london prices boosted opening oil futures in new york 
crude traders then began focusing on war fears that were stirred up 
by president bushs thanksgiving visit to us troops in saudi 
arabia 
bush told the soldiers that they might soon have to provide the 
solution to the gulf crisis that began with iraqs invasion of 
kuwait in august 
it heightened the sense that the possibility for war is 
strengthening hittle said 
but volume was extremely light as many participants were taking 
a fourday weekend in observance of thanksgiving so analysts said 
the markets big move was somewhat exaggerated 
ed kevelson at dean witter reynolds inc said traders were also 
buying oil on the belief that the un security council would soon 
be contemplating a resolution that would authorize the use of 
military force to push iraqi troops out of kuwait the war fears 
were further whipped up by news that the british were sending more 
troops into the gulf 
people certainly dont want to be short going into next 
week kevelson said 
light sweet crude oil settled at 3190 per barrel up 227 
for january delivery contracts on the new york mercantile exchange 
for the week which was shortened by the markets closing on 
thanksgiving day crude for nextmonth delivery rose 253 a 
barrel 
the rising crude prices helped pull up futures contracts for 
refined petroleum 
wholesale home heating oil was up 342 cents at 8866 cents a 
gallon on contracts for delivery in december for the week 
nextmonth heating oil contracts were up 424 cents a gallon 
wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 345 cents to 8240 cents a 
gallon on contracts for delivery in december nextmonth contracts 
for unleaded gasoline were up 477 cents a gallon for the week 
natural gas prices fell 5 cent to 2605 per 1000 cubic feet 
on contracts for january delivery for the week nextmonth natural 
gas was up 37 cents

soybean futures prices advanced at the chicago board of trade 
friday as a team of soviet grain buyers prepared to come to this 
country next week 
on other markets petroleum futures were sharply higher metals 
posted gains cattle advanced and pork futures were mostly lower 
renewed hopes of an emergency food deal with the soviet union 
and a report that brazil had reduced its planting by 15 percent 
gave soybean futures enough of a jolt to send prices up by more 
than 11 cents a bushel in early trading 
there seems to be a consensus in the market that eventually 
the soviets and the us will come to terms on emergency aid 
said joel karlin a grain analyst in chicago with research 
department inc 
the soviet team reportedly will be discussing export credits and 
their countrys longterm grain agreement with the united states 
how much attention will be given he soviet unions food needs for 
this winter was not known 
corn futures tagged along with the soybean complex but wheat 
slumped lower 
but some of the gains in soybean futures eroded due to 
commercial selling 
wheat settled cent lower to 1 cent higher with the contract 
for delivery in december at 248 a bushel corn was 1 cent to 2 
cents higher with december at 222 a bushel oats were cent to 
1 cents higher with december at 108 a bushel and soybeans were 
3 cents to 4 cents higher with january at 582 a bushel 
the prospect of a un security council vote next week on using 
force to remove iraqi troops from kuwait was the latest persian 
gulf development to send petroleum futures sharply higher on the 
new york mercantile exchange 
prices opened higher following gains in london on thanksgiving 
day when the merc was closed 
the price gains were sustained because of the persian gulf 
developments and the vague uncertainty produced by margaret 
thatchers announced resignation as prime minister of great 
britain said brian tagler energy broker in new york with shearson 
lehman hutton inc 
then late in the day came word from the british foreign office 
that the un security council may meet next week to take up the 
persian gulf crisis 
light sweet crude oil settled 75 cents to 227 higher with the 
january contract at 3190 a barrel heating oil was 210 cents to 
4 cents higher with december at 8866 cents a gallon and unleaded 
gasoline was 330 cents to 354 cents higher with december at 8240 
cents a gallon 
cattle futures were higher while pork declined on the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
cattle got a boost from the futures markets steep discount to 
cash prices and from stronger wholesale beef prices 
expectations for lower cash hog prices on monday kept pork 
futures under pressure 
live cattle settled 05 cent to 37 cent higher with the 
december contract at 7935 cents a pound feeder cattle were 
unchanged to 25 cent higher with january at 8802 cents a pound 
live hogs were 20 cent lower to 20 cent higher with december at 
5345 cents a pound and frozen pork bellies were 22 cent to 40 
cent lower with february at 7140 cents a pound 
platinum futures advanced sharply on the new york mercantile 
exchange upon word of south african mine layoffs following months 
of labor strife 
platinum gained 1370 to 1410 with january at 42970 a troy 
ounce 
at the commodity exchange in new york gold advanced 460 to 
480 with december at 38450 a troy ounce silver was 5 cent to

urging fur wearers to donate your dead and staging funeral 
processions for animals activists around the country attacked the 
fur industry on friday by taking to the streets on one of the 
busiest shopping days of the year 
from fifth avenue in midtown manhattan to a posh denver mall to 
a shopping center in tiny manchester nh nearly 100 planned 
demonstrations filled highfashion shopping spots in what has 
become an annual christmas season ritual 
the fur free friday demonstrations held the day after 
thanksgiving come at a bad time for the fur industry the shopping 
season for retail stores is expected to be sluggish at best 
dampened by the faltering economy that many merchants fear will 
keep buyers from spending on lavish gifts like mink coats 
protest organizers hailed what they called a growing awareness 
of americans against fur garments but a light rain diminished the 
size of fridays largest march in manhattan where police said 
1400 marchers participated vs more than 2000 last year 
with organizers struggling to elicit loud chants from the crowd 
the twoblock manhattan march gained momentum as it proceeded down 
fifth avenue 
led by a costumed grim reaper slowly banging a drum two 
marchers clad in skeleton outfits wheeled a cart crammed with furs 
in what a placard called a free burial for those who would 
donate your dead 
get a feel for fur slam your fingers in a car door mocked 
another poster dangling at the end of handheld stakes stuffed 
toy raccoons seals and other cute furry creatures peeped above the 
crowd 
the new york protest was largely peaceful except for a handful 
of demonstrators who organizers asked to leave the march because 
they were acting up by chanting offensive slogans said jane 
seidlitz codirector of animal rights mobilization which 
organized the demonstration 
this is not a forum where we confront fur wearers she said 
noting that the group discourages protesters from throwing paint or 
slashing fur coats 
elsewhere in new york state about 75 protesters from the animal 
rights action league demonstrated outside the macys and m solomon 
stores in colonie center mall in suburban albany 
one of our messages is for people to open their hearts and 
include the animals in their circle of compassion this holiday 
season said charles donath the groups director 
new york animal rights protesters also held demonstrations in 
niagara falls rochester syracuse and binghamton 
in denver animal rights activists from the rocky mountain 
humane society planned a march and a rally at the swank new cherry 
creek mall in denver 
in a protest that was more symbolic than others 16 people in 
manchester nh demonstrated outside a busy shopping center that 
has no furrier 
in downtown harrisburg pa a costumed grim reaper led about 40 
people chanting against the killing of animals for fur coats in an 
annual ritual in front of the strawberry square shopping center 
organizers contended that their annual campaign against what 
they call the inhumane killing of furbearing animals for luxury 
garments has put a palatable dent in sales 
they say that because of their movement some of the biggest 
department stores including nordstrom and harrods of london have 
decided to disband their fur boutiques and that some leading fur 
makers are in financial trouble 
fur industry officials deny the protests have hurt sales and 
point to what they call a 10 percent increase in sales of fur 
products last year

east president bush declared friday the world is getting tired 
of iraqs continuing occupation of kuwait and said he was closing 
in on agreement for a un resolution authorizing the use of force 
in the persian gulf 
traders speculated that seniorlevel currency investors who 
ordinarily would have responded to such news had taken the day off 
for a fourday weekend talk of war generally nudges up the value 
of the dollar which is usually viewed as relatively safehaven 
investment 
bush made some very very heavy statements today said david 
marshall senior currency analyst at mms international inc 
however instead of being responsible for a sizable increase in the 
value of the dollar the war talk accounts for a nearly 5 rise in 
the price of gold and oil went up as well

about two years ago michael milken had a chance 
to plead guilty to a couple felony counts and end the governments 
investigation before a single charge had ever been brought against 
him he didnt 
milken could have fought his case at trial bearing the pressure 
of lengthy public scrutiny but squarely confronting the 
governments claims which he and his defense lawyers maintained 
were spurious he didnt 
the 44yearold former drexel burnham lambert inc financier 
also could have spilled his guts long ago naming names and winning 
credit to earn a shorter sentence he didnt do that either 
now critics are gloating that the junk bond whiz got his 10 
years in prison and three years of fulltime community service 
just as watergate closed out the 1970s milkens punishment is 
viewed as a headstone for the 1980s the end of an era of greed 
but while no one predicted the severity of the sentence handed 
down last week by us district judge kimba wood legal experts are 
questioning milkens strategy during his fouryear confrontation 
with the justice department 
the lawyer has to follow the clients instructions said 
john j coffee jr a columbia university law professor milken 
was not some wimp who was totally dependent on his lawyers advice 
he knows his own personal calculus 
i think he probably estimated he might have served two or 
three years coffee said certainly no one predicted this as 
the likely outcome but a man who lives with junk bonds knows there 
are risks out there 
the general postmortem in the legal community is that milken 
and his highpriced defense team led by arthur liman may have 
miscalculated at various points among them 
balking at a deal with prosecutors about two years ago that 
would have allowed milken to plead guilty to two or three felony 
counts milken sources contend the government wanted an admission 
of insider trading which milken found unacceptable 
loudly criticizing the governments investigation indictment 
and tactics and trumpeting milkens innocence after the plea 
deal liman argued strenuously that milken was guilty only of 
technical violations in the end milken appeared to get little if 
any credit for settling the case 
pleading guilty to six felony counts an unheard of 
amount coffee said liman may have wrongly assumed the judge 
would discount the number of counts if she found they were minor 
breaches but wood sentenced milken to consecutive twoyear terms 
on each of five counts on count six conspiracy he got probation 
letting the government raise additional charges before 
sentencing when the defense contested the claims and wood couldnt 
square the pictures she held a hearing the judge didnt find 
milken had committed the substantive charges but she did find he 
obstructed justice during the federal probe a serious violation in 
judges eyes 
delaying cooperation until after sentencing wood toughened the 
sentence because milken had not assisted the government milken 
long had refused to cooperate now he faces a catch22 he has to 
snitch to qualify for a reduction but if his genuine assistance 
proves of little value he gets no credit 
milkens strategy did yield a few benefits he avoided the 
humiliation of a long trial that would have kept him and his family 
in the public eye for years and the government agreed to drop all 
charges against his brother lowell 
but several defense lawyers and legal scholars agreed that 
milkens approach during the fouryear ordeal was indecisive 
if youre going to rattle sabers youre better off going 
through with it said an attorney with a client involved in the 
milken case who asked not to be named if youre going to go in 
and try to cooperate you do it in a quiet meek way if youre 
going to grovel you grovel 
milken did none of those 
you cant cooperate halfway securities lawyer ira sorkin 
said either you go 100 percent or zero by saying youre really 
sorry feel terrible you hurt people but not telling the 
government more she perceived that as noncooperation 
in fairness to milken the secondguessing is pinned to the 
lengthy term which no one had anticipated 
there are all sorts of factors that went into that decision to 
plead guilty that we will never know about criminal defense 
lawyer judd burstein said you just cant look and say he made a 
bad decision because he got 10 years 
under his plea agreement milken now must answer any questions 
posed by the government judge wood said she would consider 
reducing the sentence based on a recommendation from the government 
praising milkens cooperation 
under federal law the defense has 120 days to request a 
reduction in sentence the us attorneys office would have to 
support the request if milken were to have any chance for a quick 
reduction 
before the government agrees to spring milken early he likely 
would have to provide information leading to other indictments a 
main focus is expected to be fraud in the collapse of the nations 
savings and loans which bought about 10 billion in risky 
highyield bonds from drexel 
bringing other types of cases is expected to be more difficult 
because federal law bars prosecution for crimes committed more than 
five years ago and many of the deals milken already are older than 
that congress last year extended the statute of limitations for 
sampls to 10 years 
while 120 days isnt much time milken could file the motion to 
reduce sentence and judge wood could delay it for months while he 
cooperates but that still might not be long enough to develop 
enough cases to satisfy prosecutors 
milkens next choice is how much to cooperate 
it sounds to me like shes laying out the red carpet for 
him said alan bromberg a securities law professor at southern 
methodist university how far down it he can go and how much good 
it will do is very hard to predict 
all ive heard is hes not a tattletale type it will go 
against the grain for him bromberg said 
michael is a basically loyal human being said a defense 
lawyer for a former drexel trader who testified against milken 
he has been very opposed to telling anything in regard to those 
people with whom he has dealt 
whatever milkens cooperation produces his sentence seemed to 
satisfy those who viewed milken as the embodiment of wall street 
greed despite a modest generous lifestyle that contrasted with 
that of his main accuser inside trader ivan boesky 
the handful of letters sent to the judge by people who dont 
know milken suggested life in prison or physical torture liman 
said the requests would probably stagger the secret police of 
totalitarian regimes the anger toward milken was great but many 
people on wall street said it was misdirected 
he was this eras target one defense lawyer said we are 
a society that likes to blame someone 
said sorkin the only conclusion that can be drawn is that 
there was greed before the 1980s and there will be greed after the 
1980s if you look at what the stock market was like in the first 
40 years of this century what boesky and milken and the rest of 
them did would pale by comparison

each day it seems theres an announcement about the soviet 
union reaching agreement for food aid with another western nation 
meanwhile the us farm sector watches these multibillion 
dollar deals from outside its nose pressed to the window 
yet hope persists despite repeated disappointments 
the european community cant provide soy oil and meal and 
the united states is about the only source for these commodities 
now said joel karlin a grain analyst in chicago with research 
department inc 
wheat can be bought cheaply enough from canada or argentina and 
barley can be substituted for corn if the united states is cut out 
of any extraordinary deals this fall with the soviets 
in the past month soviet leader mikhail gorbachev has arranged 
for 10 billion in emergency food aid to help his country get 
through the winter as these deals were announced corn and wheat 
traders at the chicago board of trade became more resigned to the 
belief that there wont be much if anything left over for us 
exporters of these commodities 
the bush administration has indicated that it is looking for 
liberalized emigration laws in the soviet union before its willing 
to talk export credits 
futures traders and grain analysts say they think bush will be 
more willing to help if gorbachev is firmly lined up with the us 
in dealing with iraq 
this line of reasoning sent soybean prices sharply higher a week 
ago before the meetings in europe between bush and gorbachev the 
gains were quickly lost when no grain deal was announced but 
quickly went back up again when gorbachev said the issue of force 
should be decided by the un security council 
by weeks end prices were back up on reports that the soviets 
were about to codify liberalized emigration laws further the 
market began talking about the arrival in washington on monday of a 
grainbuying team from the soviet union 
how much this team will focus on longterm trade arrangements 
and how much on immediate aid for this winter remains to be seen 
there seems to be a concensus in the market that eventually 
the soviets and the us will come to terms on emergency aid 
karlin said 
he noted that legislators and farm groups have become 
increasingly vocal on the need to give agricultural exports a shot 
in the arm 
us soy oil and meal presumably are on the soviet shopping 
list cooking oil is one among many food staples reported in 
critically short supply there and soybean oil is about the cheapest 
oil available and abundant supplies of soy meal make it the 
obvious choice for animal feed 
nonetheless said karlin if the soviets dont get credit they 
probably wont buy 
so if we dont so anything were going to be left behind 
he said
