a storm packing snow and freezing rain moved eastward across the 
northern plains on wednesday after walloping wyoming and colorado 
with their worst winter storm in years 
about 130 miles of interstate highway remained closed in wyoming 
late wednesday night and nearly 4000 state employees in cheyenne 
who were told to stay home tuesday were given wednesday morning 
off more than 300 miles of highway in the state were closed 
earlier 
the storm dumped up to 50 inches of snow in parts of northern 
colorado and shut down travel from the denver area to southeastern 
wyoming 
in colorado a blizzard delayed an agent with the us bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms who was driving to crested butte to 
investigate a bank explosion that killed 13 people his car skidded 
on an icy highway and rolled over 
the agent escaped injury and his fellow investigators dubbed 
him crash 
in central iowa about 60000 customers of iowa power lost 
electricity wednesday night due to an ice storm which snapped tree 
limbs bringing down power lines more than half the households in 
the des moines area were without power iowa power spokesman john 
mccarroll said 
more than 200 businesses and virtually all of the schools in 
metropolitan denver colorado springs and many northern colorado 
communities remained closed wednesday or opened late 
the fierce storm driven by winds up to 50 mph was blamed for 
at least one traffic death in colorado and some highways were 
still closed and littered with stuck and stalled vehicles wednesday 
morning 
us highway 36 between denver and boulder resembled a parking 
lot tuesday night according to the state patrol 
at denvers stapleton international airport nearly all airlines 
voluntarily stopped flying tuesday forcing about 2000 travelers 
to spend the night at the terminal 
during the height of the storm tuesday the wyoming highway 
patrol closed a number of roads including about 200 miles of 
interstate 80 from the nebraska border to rawlins and about 200 
miles of i25 from the colorado border north to casper by 
wednesday afternoon only a 110mile stretch of i25 had been 
reopened from wheatland to casper 
colorado authorities closed i25 and i70 the two major 
thoroughfares through metropolitan denver and i76 to the 
northeast virtually closing off the city most were reopened 
wednesday but i25 remained closed from fort collins north to the 
wyoming state line 
at midday wednesday snow still fell from central south dakota 
to western nebraska southeastern wyoming and northern colorado 
freezing rain extended from northcentral and eastern south dakota 
to southeastern minnesota and much of iowa rain fell to the south 
and east from texas to parts of illinois 
hundreds of vehicles slid into ditches in iowa and many rural 
schools were closed many schools in southeastern south dakota also 
closed 
snowfall in colorado varied widely 50 inches on mount evans 44 
inches in coal creek canyon near boulder and 3 inches at colorado 
springs denver received 113 inches 
snowplows were out early and in force in cheyenne trying to 
clear side streets and some main roads that were buried under 16 
inches of snow the most to fall on the city since a storm in april 
1984 dumped 18 inches according to the national weather service 
the cleanup was expected to get easier thursday when 
temperatures were expected to soar into the 50s 
thats one of the pluses of having the storms here in wyoming 
in march and april said meteorologist jack daseler the suns 
up at a higher angle it warms up quicker after the storms and 
its not so bad its not like getting one the last week of 
december when the snow stays around for six or seven weeks 
in linden texas a 30yearold employee of the state highway 
department was killed wednesday when a lightning bolt struck a 
hoisted steel beam and electrified a chain he was holding 
authorities said linden is about 150 miles east of dallas

this city whose political scandals have made 
national headlines is teaching the tricks of the trade to polish 
officials seeking an american model for restructuring their 
government 
what might sound like a joke to some is part of a program aimed 
at helping poland implement democratic reforms in local government 
after nearly half a century of communist rule 
of all the problems chicago has had with its reputation much 
of it deserved as a place that has problems governmentally and 
politically it also has a lot of plusses said paul green a 
political scientist at governors state university in suburban 
university park 
and if you want to see where the games really played for 
keeps why go to someplace where they eat quiche 
despite the communistled governments stunning defeat in last 
junes elections local government still remains in the hands of 
the communist apparatus said robert repel an aide to mayor 
richard m daley 
supporters of democracy hope to change that in elections set for 
may so three polish reformers have come to the united states to 
learn how democratic local governments operate 
chicago one of several cities on their us tour was chosen 
because its warsaws sister city and has more poles than any city 
outside of warsaw repel said 
the reputation for crooked politics in the windy city so named 
because of longwinded politicians of old was not at all among 
topics discussed repel said tuesday the final day of the poles 
twoday stop in chicago 
the city instead gathered local authorities in various facets of 
governing including finance trade crime and the courts to 
share their expertise with the visitors 
im certain that they are aware of all of the good things 
about chicago and all of the bad things about chicago but were 
not talking about political scandals were talking about some 
governmental issues repel said 
but scandals often have been an issue in chicago a century of 
democratic machine politics made influencepeddling and patronage 
seem like part of the system 
in recent years as federal prosecutors have cracked down on 
public corruption and reform has replaced machine politics dozens 
of crooked city officials have been sent to jail 
one probe codenamed operation greylord exposed the largest 
judicial corruption scandal in the nations history some 70 
judges lawyers and other court personnel were convicted of bribery 
and related charges 
we still have crooked local politics its just that the 
politicians arent as adept at stealing as they once were 
chicago tribune columnist mike royko said in a telephone interview 
that may be still the poles visit coincided with a primary 
election campaign that recently has been enlivened by fbi tapes of 
an alleged mobster saying he had helped engineer daleys election 
last year as well as made payoffs to the cook county republican 
chairman neither charge has been proved 
but most poles know virtually nothing about chicagos political 
reputation said wlodzimierz kocon one of the visitors 
kocon is a director at the foundation in support of local 
democracy a warsawbased group that is training candidates for 
elections 
neither our economy nor our social system can change wthout 
assistance from the united states and cities like chicago kocon 
said in a meeting with city officials monday 
afterward he politely declined to discuss chicagos reputation 
but noted we both have to learn from each other as much as we 
can 
and chicago could be a good teacher the sardonic royko observed 
weve gone from a very closed form of government to a very 
open form of government and party loyalty is no longer a 
prerequisite for a majority of city jobs and i assume the 
poles want to make party loyalty an unnecessary element so this 
is really a very good training ground

the message coming down the milan runway for 
the fallwinter 199091 is so clear it risks becoming monotonous 
short skirts and shorts long jackets parkas and duffel coats 
these are the staples of next winters moda milanese 
in recent seasons italian designers have presented a varied 
wardrobe for the modern woman who likes to make up her own style 
not this time 
most blatant is the total absence of belowtheknee hemlines 
the new length plays around the thigh in miniskirts and bermuda 
shorts anything longer looks positively dowdy like the basile 
skirts which mind you were several inches above the knee 
for those who cant bear to bare their knees the designers 
present lots of pants but they are all in stretchfabric or knit 
also only flattering on a fortunate few 
the alternative is to run around all day in evening gowns the 
only garment to safely cover the body from hip to ankle and even 
in this department the selection is limited with many evening 
outfits as short by night as by day 
the new skirt is worn with a long jacket either slightly shorter 
than the skirt or even with it sometimes the jacket is tailored 
at others it is free and swaying to create a bell shape that is 
repeated in the wide sleeve 
the other big theme of these collections is the parka or duffel 
coat complete with hood more often than not trimmed in fur 
ecological plush that is real skins are definitely out of fashion 
copying from functional ski wear many of the coats have draw 
string waists or hemlines to keep out winter chills 
even staid genny and basile who showed their fallwinter styles 
on tuesday opted for the short hemline and sporty parka look 
leaving their career girl clients in a bind 
genny showed a series of tailored suits in prim and proper 
flannel that would have been great for the office if the hemline 
and the jacket had not converged eight inches above the knee 
her trouser styles were pencil slim or pert bermudas both not 
ideal for a long working day 
cozy parkas with a huge fur trimmed hood were ideal for weekend 
fun but not a night out with the boss 
basile did keep the hemline down to only a couple of inches 
above the knee but he concentrated more on sportswear than city 
life with plaid bermuda shorts riding jackets and loads of gaily 
colored duffel coats

the flood of soviet immigrants into israel 
has roused fears among arabs that the jewish state will shun peace 
efforts and seek more land for a rapidly growing population 
they also worry about the improved eastwest relations that made 
the increased flow possible and about the political revolution in 
eastern europe 
i dont think weve faced a more serious matter since the 
1930s when a massive jewish immigration to palestine took place 
foreign minister marwan kassem of jordan told the weekly star 
newspaper last month 
at least 300000 soviet jews are expected to reach israel in the 
next few years because of the kremlins relaxed emigration rules 
they now arrive at the rate of about 1200 a week 
that will alter the palestinian demographic equation that 
because of a higher birth rate they eventually would outnumber 
jews in israel as well as the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the emigration issue is only one consequence of the new detente 
which many arabs believe seriously undermines their strategy 
against israel 
such longtime radical allies of moscow as syria and libya 
already feel the cooling in moscow caused by political 
liberalization and are edging back to the arab mainstream 
in what used to be the soviet bloc democratic governments are 
replacing the rigid communist regimes that backed the arabs some 
of the new governments have renewed relations with israel which 
their predecessors broke in 1967 
these developments have spurred efforts to forge a new arab 
unity there is talk of reviving a military alliance of iraq syria 
and jordan on israels borders 
kassem compared the mass soviet emigration to 1948 when israel 
was born and hundreds of thousands of palestinians fled to jordan 
syria lebanon and egypt 
yasser arafat chairman of the palestine liberation 
organization and secretarygeneral chedli klibi of the arab league 
called the immigration a catastrophe kuwaits cabinet said it 
was flagrant aggression 
about 1 million jews have applied to leave the soviet union and 
israeli officials say they expect about 300000 to arrive in the 
next three years israels jewish population now is about 4 million 
in a statement to israel radio last month prime minister 
yitzhak shamir said arabs oppose all immigration for them 
the immigration of soviet jews to israel is a sign of defeat in 
their war against the state of israel and zionism 
arabs see the mass influx as creating a stronger israel less 
willing to make peace on terms arabs consider acceptable 
israel already stands as the major military power in the area 
so any increase is bound to worry us said kamel abu jaber a 
political scientist at the university of jordan 
we know there are something like 3 million soviet jews were 
talking about the first stage of 1 million arriving when will the 
other 2 million arrive where will be the next jump 
he and other arab analysts believe the latest wave of 
immigration also could 
bring new jewish settlers to the west bank gaza strip and 
golan heights all of which israel captured in 1967 the return of 
those lands is a key element in all arab peace plans and most 
others 
this influx will make israel more instransigent in denying 
palestinian rights to regain their lands the united arab 
emirates said 
increase israeli pressure on palestinians in the occupied 
lands to move to jordan which could threaten the stability of a 
nation bordering the two most important oil states saudi arabia 
and iraq 
king hussein of jordan said that fits what he described as plans 
of israeli hardliners to make jordan a substitute palestinian 
state 
deal another blow to the hope millions of palestinians have of 
returning to their homeland or creating a palestinian state in the 
west bank and gaza 
our own refugees who have spent most of their lives scattered 
around the world without a home have the priority over soviet jews 
to return to their homeland palestine said a petition signed by 
85 members of the palestine national council which acts as the plo 
legislature 
revive an old fear that zionists will achieve their dream of 
gathering most jews into palestine creating pressure for expansion 
into areas of lebanon and jordan that israeli religious extremists 
consider part of the ancient land of israel 
israel has declared its expansionist nature and has proved 
that nature said abu jaber the jordanian political scientist

president corazon aquinos gettough 
move against her opponents was widely hailed as a welcome sign of 
strength but a supreme court rebuff and bloodshed in the north 
raise doubts about skill in implementing the policy 
last week the government filed rebellion with murder charges 
against opposition sen juan ponce enrile and six others in 
connection with the failed dec 19 coup in which 113 people were 
killed 
the filing of charges was widely praised by commentators and the 
media who recalled the generally mild treatment of conspirators 
after some of the five previous coup attempts since mrs aquino 
took office 
its a welcome sign said one western diplomat speaking 
last week on condition of anonymity its about time she showed 
toughness the top priority for this government now is survival 
but in recent days the strategy shows signs of unraveling 
because of tactical blunders 
at issue was a decision to indict enrile and the others for 
rebellion with murder a charge used by the late president 
ferdinand marcos but which mrs aquino nullified in 1987 as 
repressive 
simple rebellion is punishable by six to 12 years imprisonment 
and defendants are normally allowed bail rebellion with murder 
however provides a life sentence with no bail that would keep 
enrile and the others in detention even before the trial began 
on tuesday however the supreme court released enrile and two 
fellow defendants on bail and a justice said the tribunal would 
decide later on the validity of the dual charge 
presidential press secretary tomas gomez today said the ruling 
is neither a setback for the government nor is it a victory for 
enrile because the main topic has not been decided the validity 
of the charge 
but during his week in custody enrile held frequent news 
conferences where he sought to portray himself as an aggrieved 
underdog he often told reporters he was praying for mrs aquino 
whom he helped sweep to power in 1986 and thanked her for the 
free publicity 
sen ernesto maceda a lawyer and frequent administration 
critic said the government had tranformed enrile into a martyr 
and a hero 
before leaving the police headquarters where he was held enrile 
signed autographs for his jailers they cheered when he told them 
if you need anything just come to my office 
whoever was responsible for the misguided advice and ensuing 
fiasco should perhaps consider offering their resignations 
said the manila times an independent daily 
compounding the problem is the public perception that evidence 
against enrile is weak in the charge sheet the government based 
its case is based on statements by three waiters who claimed they 
saw a coup leader former lt col gregorio gringo honasan at 
enriles home on the first day of the december coup attempt 
enriles lawyer renato cayetano claims he has 53 witnesses 
ready to testify that honasan was not there the waiters did not 
testify about any alleged conversations between enrile and honasan 
according to documents made public 
we can only hope the government has sufficient evidence to 
back up the charges said the independent philippine daily 
inquirer otherwise it would lend credence to the enrile camps 
accusations that the senator was held on a spurious charge as part 
of a grand political vendetta 
the decision to indict the seven on the controversial dual 
charge may also have contributed to sundays bloodshed in 
tuguegarao 250 miles north of manila 
officials went to tuguegarao capital of cagayan province to 
arrest suspended provincial gov rodolfo aguinaldo one of the 
seven defendants aguinaldo told reporters he was willing to 
surrender on rebellion charges but not murder because i didnt 
kill anybody 
after four days of negotiations aguinaldos followers seized a 
hotel taking brig gen oscar florendo prisoner and trapping local 
governments secretary luis santos on the second floor 
florendo was killed when government troops recaptured the hotel 
aguinaldo escaped with an estimated 200 armed followers mrs 
aquino says florendo was murdered by aguinaldos forces 
most lawyers believe that the situation in cagayan would never 
have ended in bloodshed if government prosecutors had not 
reinvented the charge of rebellion complexed with murder wrote 
commentator luis beltran in the manila standard was it worth the 
price just to show decisiveness and firmness

the us postal service is beginning steps to 
raise prices even while conceding that the new rates may be too 
much too soon 
more expensive postage including a 30cent first class stamp 
is still nearly a year away thanks to a lengthy and complex 
ratemaking process established by congress 
the mail agency is facing a deficit of between 14 billion and 
16 billion in this fiscal year forcing it to begin the effort to 
raise revenue it is required by law to break even over time and no 
longer receives any taxpayer subsidy 
i think it should have been 28 or 29 cents and we want to pay 
that back to the american people we want to improve service and 
operate below the rate of inflation we want that to be translated 
into never again saying too much too soon postmaster general 
anthony m frank said tuesday 
we cannot ignore that increases in postal costs do occur just 
as they do in any business said robert setrakian chairman of 
the postal services board of governors which proposed the rate 
hikes 
setrakian estimated that the higher rates would cost the average 
individual 10 to 11 annually 
frank said the rate increase is more than the inflation that has 
occurred since the current prices took effect in 1988 because of 
unexpectedly high costs 
productivity although improving recently didnt increase as 
fast as expected he said in addition costs were considerably 
higher than planned including employee health costs and the 
requirement that the postal service contribute funds to help defray 
the federal budget deficit in recent years 
those factors forced the agency to seek a 19 percent rate 
increase to cover a period when inflation is projected to total 
about 14 percent frank said 
opposition to higher prices came immediately from diverse 
directions 
the new york state consumer protection board announced that it 
will intervene in the rate case to oppose the plan 
it is ludicrous to ask consumers to pay more for slower mail 
service said richard m kessel the commissions executive 
director 
the proposed increase is excessive and selfdefeating the 
american bankers association argued 
such postal rate increases imposed upon business ultimately 
in some fashion will be paid by busness customers said vincent 
a liguori chairman of abas postal service committee 
the people are going to have to save the post office from 
itself said consumer advocate ralph nader who proposed to set 
up a grassroots organization of mail users 
the planned rate hike is unreasonable and unjustified 
charged tracey schreft of the us chamber of commerce 
and robert kamerschen head of advo system inc the nations 
largest advertising mailer said he is concerned that raising rates 
will drive profitable mail out of the postal system just at the 
time its needed most 
the vote tuesday by the postal board of governors was just the 
first step in the process the question now goes to the independent 
postal rate commission 
the fivemember commission has 10 months to consider the case 
it will hold hearings and solicit information from the postal 
service businesses and individuals 
following that the commission will send a set of proposed rates 
back to the postal governors often it agrees with the original 
request but not always 
in 1984 for example the postal service proposed a 23cent 
first class rate the postal rate commission cut that back to 22 
cents the governors accepted that decision 
but they dont have to if the governors can put together a 
unanimous vote they can overrule the commission that happened in 
1981 when the governors raised the firstclass rate from 15 cents 
to 20 cents even though the commission said 18 cents would be 
enough

governors of the us postal service would mean higher mail costs 
for most individuals and businesses

effect probably sometime in early 1991 
individual cost of mailing a letter or paying a bill 30 cents 
up from 25 cents 
cost to mail a regular post card 20 cents up from 15 cents 
price of sending a sevenpound package 506 up from 400 
charge to a bank to send a threeounce statement 76 cents up 
from 65 cents 
department store cost to mail a presorted bill 26 cents up 
from 21 cents 
price to send a creditcard bill sorted according to the full 
ninedigit zip code 253 cents up from 205 cents 
utility company cost to send a bill with imprinted bar code 
allowing it to be handled by machines 243 cents up from 20 cents 
lawyers cost to send onepound of legal documents by priority 
mail 275 up from 240 
charge to send eight ounces of highspeed business information

major airlines improved in the number of 
ontime flights and received fewer baggage handling complaints in 
january the government says 
the transportation department in its monthly air travel 
consumer report said tuesday the largest domestic carriers 
reported that 776 percent of their flights were on time in 
january compared with 702 percent in december 
the january performance was also a slight improvement over a 
year ago when the ontime rate was 767 percent delays caused by 
mechanical failures are not counted 
southwest airlines had the best record for the month with 825 
percent ontime performance and eastern had the worst with 707 
percent 
reports of mishandled baggage averaged 87 per 1000 passengers 
compared with 1278 in december which was the worst performance

the american medical association today 
proposed revamping the nations health care system by expanding 
medicaid and requiring employers to provide health insurance to 
fulltime employees 
the amas 16point plan also would create state risk pools to 
provide group insurance policies for the medically uninsurable 
small businesses and others unable to afford coverage under the 
current system 
the plan would cost about 60 billion the ama said but it did 
not suggest where the money should come from 
the physicians group said its proposals are aimed at offering 
health care coverage to all americans regardless of income and 
preserving patients freedom to choose their healthcare provider 
the individuals freedom of choice remains a cornerstone of 
the american system said dr alan r nelson ama president 
revision in the current system is badly needed nelson said 
but it would be counterproductive to fix aspects of our system 
that are not broken 
the amas proposal is similar to a 66 billion plan recommended 
last week by the us bipartisan commission on comprehensive health 
care known as the pepper commission for its first chairman the 
late rep claude pepper dfla 
both proposals are aimed at closing the gaps in the current 
health care system 
the nations healthcare bill is expected to reach 600 billion 
this year more than 11 percent of the gross national product yet 
more than 33 million americans lack health insurance 
the highlights of the ama plan include 
expanding medicaid to all people below the poverty level and 
establishing a uniform set of benefits medicaid now covers fewer 
than half of those living below the poverty line and eligibility 
and benefits vary from state to state 
requiring employers to provide health insurance for all 
fulltime employees and their families and eliminating 
statemandated benefits employers would be allowed tax deductions 
to help with costs 
establishing state risk pools to make coverage available for 
the medically uninsurable and for others for whom individual health 
insurance policies are too expensive and group coverage is not 
available about 15 states currently have such pools 
expanding private sector coverage of longterm care with tax 
incentives 
revising medical malpractice laws to reduce liability insurance 
costs for physicians and the practice of defensive medicine such 
as ordering tests and procedures that otherwise might not be 
ordered

congressional republicans are renewing a 
25yearold fight to allow more older americans to draw full social 
security pensions even if they continue to work 
republicans say they will try to force repeated votes in the 
democraticcontrolled house and senate to get their way this year 
we are going to vote on it over and over and over again said 
sen phil gramm rtexas 
for the moment the bush administration is on the sidelines 
because by some estimates the change would cost the treasury about 
4 billion a year in lost taxes sponsors of the bill say the 
government actually would end up with more money as former retirees 
returned to the work force 
the battle is over a provision that is as old as the social 
security system itself the retirement test or earnings 
limitation restricts the amount of wages a person age 62 to 70 
may earn without losing any social security pension 
a person age 62 63 or 64 may earn 6840 a year without 
penalty for each 2 earned above that level the person forfeits 
1 in benefits a person who has reached 65 but has not yet turned 
70 gives up 1 for each 3 earned above 9360 there is no 
restriction on those 70 and older 
the gop bill would repeal the earnings limitation for those 65 
and older as the party first promised in the 1964 party platform 
on which barry goldwater ran 
the limitation is a governmentsponsored program to push 
seniors out of the work force and into the rocking chair senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas told a news conference 
tuesday in my opinion thats age discrimination of the worst 
sort 
it is time that this depressionera fossil was done away 
with said rep dennis hastert rill chief house sponsor of 
the bill 
hastert said 181 of the 435 house members have signed on as 
cosponsors as have 18 of the 100 senators a big reduction in the 
earnings limit was approved by the full house and by the senate 
finance committee last year but died in the senate as part of a 
deficitreduction agreement 
democratic leaders have fought the repeal bill over the years 
for two reasons 
they note the first limit was placed in the law in 1939 even 
before the first social security check was ever written to ensure 
that pensions went only to people who were retired 
secondly congressional analysts say that repealing the earnings 
limit would benefit only the wealthiest 10 percent of older 
americans 
according to the house ways and means committee more than 8 
million people age 65 through 69 received social security benefits 
in 1986 although one of every five beneficiaries had some earnings 
that year only 600000 earned more than the limit and thus 
forfeited part of their pension 
its an outdated idea that penalizes productive older 
americans who choose to remain in the work place said sen rudy 
boschwitz rminn 
if we are serious about tax equity this is the place to 
start said rep john j rhodes iii rariz 
backers of the bill say the earnings limitation in combination 
with federal and state income taxes and social security taxes has 
the effect of pushing some older americans into a 70 percent tax 
bracket

her best movies may be behind her and shes no 
longer a congressional wife but elizabeth taylor can still draw a 
crowd on capitol hill 
the movie star and outspoken advocate of more aids spending used 
her celebrity appeal tuesday to help promote a new bill that would 
provide 600 million in emergency aid to care for people with the 
disease 
we need money we need lots of money and we need it now 
she said our cities and states are being choked by the enormous 
cost of caring for aids patients 
she helped draw a crowd of television cameras and reporters to a 
news conference at which sens edward kennedy dmass and orrin 
hatch rutah unveiled their bipartisan aids bill later she was 
the main witness at a house hearing on aids 
it took elizabeth taylor to get you to one of my hearings 
the subcommittee chairman rep barbara boxer dcalif said to 
rep richard durbin dill 
appearing with taylor were lawmakers from both parties leaders 
on the aids issue and mayors including democrats david dinkins of 
new york and ray flynn of boston and republican dick berkley of 
kansas city mo 
the bill would provide 300 million in direct emergency 
assistance to 13 cities with the worst aids problems another 300 
million would go to states to develop comprehensive programs to 
care for people with aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
much of the urban aid would be directed at big city hospitals 
which are swamped with impoverished aids victims kennedy said the 
rest of the money would be aimed at small cities and rural areas 
now seeing the greatest increase in aids cases 
taylor whose list of former husbands includes sen john warner 
rva is the founding chairman of the american foundation for aids 
research 
she wore a dark green dress her black hair swept high above her 
ahead and appeared to have put back on some of the weight she shed 
in a wellpublicized diet 
later taylor attended a white house dinner honoring italian 
prime minister giulio andreotti she told reporters she had spoken 
to barbara bush on monday about aids shes very informed and 
very receptive she knows a lot about the issue the actress said 
i came to washington for aids in a way it was kind of 
therapeutic for me the actress said referring to the recent 
death of her friend and companion publisher malcolm forbes 
the fuss over taylor on capitol hill was noted by belinda mason 
a member of the national commission on aids while saying she 
appreciated taylors appearance she added 
i think its kind of sad we have to have miss taylor to 
get the kind of attention this issue needs i find that demeaning 
as a person with aids 
taylor said she was concerned that there was a very disturbing 
resurgence of ignorance and misinformation about aids including 
the suggestion that aids affects only homosexuals drug users the 
poor and minorities 
sadly the darkest days of the aids crisis still lie ahead of 
us she said hundreds of thousands of lives hang in the 
balance unless we begin to confront aids as a true national medical 
emergency

an angry mayor teddy kollek gathered his city 
council in a jewish neighborhood built on the edge of arab east 
jerusalem and criticized the united states for opposing jewish 
settlement there 
the special meeting tuesday was just the latest reflection of an 
uproar that began three days earlier when president bush said aid 
to israel could be affected by the israeli governments policy of 
settling jews on captured land 
that land includes east jerusalem 
for 23 years israel and the united states have disagreed about 
the status of jerusalem a city fought over for centuries because 
it is holy to jews christians and moslems 
although the united states and most other countries have never 
recognized israels annexation of east jerusalem us presidents 
have previously not challenged israels building programs there 
the council resolution repeats israels stand that jerusalems 
arab eastern sector annexed after its capture from jordan along 
with the west bank in the 1967 middle east war was part of the 
eternal capital of the jewish people 
declarations that differentiate between the status of various 
jerusalem neighborhoods and prejudice the rights of jewish 
immigrants to come and live in jerusalem do not contribute to 
the overall peace process it says 
kollek said he felt offended by recent american statements 
about israels settlement policies 
since 1967 seven new jewish neighborhoods have been built on 
the fringes of east jerusalem which is home to about 150000 
palestinians an estimated 120000 jewish residents now live in 
these suburbs including about 15000 in the neve yaacov 
neighborhood where tuesdays council session was held 
more construction is planned some to house the thousands of 
jews expected to immigrate here from the soviet union 
the issue of soviet resettlement has angered palestinians in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip and in jerusalem they have been 
rebelling against israeli rule for the past 27 months in hopes of 
establishing an independent state with jerusalem known in arabic 
as alquds or the holy as its capital 
it is a question that is not subject to negotiations 
palestinian activist sari nusseibeh said in a telephone interview 
tuesday east jerusalem is the capital of the occupied 
palestinian state 
he added the unilateral action of israel having annexed it 
does not change the historical facts and the political facts 
nusseibeh a philosophy professor whose family is believed to 
have come to jerusalem with the arab conquerer saladin in the 12th 
century said he accepted israels demand that the city remain 
undivided however he said it could be a city with two capitals 
or the seats of two capitals 
such a compromise is ruled out by the austrianborn kollek who 
says it would lead to rebuilding the walls that separated jews and 
arabs before 1967 
two capitals in one city would mean two laws two police 
forces two customs courts kollek told reporters within no 
time you would have the wall up again that we had before 
but israels capital is now in practice divided by the 
palestinian uprising 
before the revolt began in december 1987 israelis went 
regularly to shop on saladin street the main arab shopping area 
on the jewish holy day of saturday when virtually all shops in 
jewish west jerusalem are closed 
now few israelis are seen in east jerusalem on saturday or any 
other day jewish cab drivers often refuse fares to the area and 
the government is building a new bypass road to allow residents of 
west bank jewish settlements to get to their homes without going 
through east jerusalem

the financial crunch on farmers during the 
1980s left its mark on the major agricultural lenders by changing 
their shares of the credit market says an agriculture department 
analyst 
in 1980 the cooperatively owned farm credit system was the 
giant among lenders with 441 percent of the market followed by 
commercial banks with a 313 percent piece of the action 
but doug duncan of the departments economic research service 
said the two lenders nearly reversed their positions by 1989 
with commercial banks owning 406 percent market share while the 
fcs dropped to an estimated 325 percent 
the farmers home administration long known as the governments 
lender of last resort to people denied loans by others began the 
decade with 146 percent of the market rose to 206 percent in 
1987 and probably wound up last year with an 187 percent share 
duncan writing in the march issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine said only life insurance companies have retained a 
fairly constant market share which ranged between 82 percent 
and 10 percent in the 1980s 
life insurance companies he added were the only ones of the 
four lender groups that were relatively unaffected by direct 
regulatory or legislative action during the decade 
for example the fmha has seen its lending thrust changed from 
direct lending to more guarantees for privately made loans in 
1980 99 percent of the agencys farm loans was earmarked as direct 
loans by 1989 only 46 percent went to direct loans and 54 percent 
to guarantees 
looking at the fcs duncan said the network of banks and 
associations nearly collapsed in 1985 but was saved by a series 
of legislative actions culminating in the agricultural credit act 
of 1987 
the act radically changed the structure of the fcs he 
wrote it required districtlevel mergers between federal land 
banks and federal intermediate credit banks creating new farm 
credit banks 
further the new credit banks were then allowed to merge across 
the systems 12 districts to as few as six banks the law also 
permitted mergers among banks for cooperatives and mergers between 
federal land bank associations and production credit associations 
more structural changes are anticipated as the system strives 
to become more efficient and regain its market share of the loan 
business duncan said 
commercial banks were deregulated at the federal level in the 
early 1980s as the decade progressed many states relaxed their 
regulations against branch banking and interstate banking was 
fostered 
the farm and oilrelated contractions combined with surging 
bank failure rates and new failure resolution policies led to 
greater differences between large and small banks performance 
duncan wrote 
nearly 1600 banks mostly small went out of business between 
1982 and 1989 and duncan expects the trend to continue 
even though agriculture traditionally has been served by 
small independent banks as of midyear 1989 the largest banks 
held nearly onequarter of commercial bank farm debt he said 
and the big banks are increasing their share

dry conditions still hung on in the northern 
great plains but rain and abovenormal temperatures continued to 
boost winter wheat prospects in the central and southern plains 
according to the governments joint agricultural weather facility 
in kansas crop condition was good except in the central and 
northcentral area where soil moisture was still short the 
facility said tuesday in its report for feb 26march 4 insect 
and disease problems were very light 
the facility is operated by the agriculture and commerce 
departments weekly reports cover wheat and crop conditions but do 
not include production forecasts 
relatively warm weather and ample moisture supplies hastened 
wheat growth in oklahoma while the crops condition was reported 
good in arkansas and fair to good in missouri rain also helped the 
texas crop 
but the report added the northern great plains remained dry 
in nebraska winter wheat was fair to poor wind damaged fields in 
the northern and western areas 
wheat was breaking dormancy in eastern and southeastern 
areas of nebraska but were under stress from lack of moisture 
in montana winter wheat was fair to good the report said 
growth was good in california although the numbers of russian 
wheat aphids continued to increase in the sacramento valley 
crop conditions were reported good to fair in washington while 
in oregon winter wheat was said to be fair in the east and good to 
excellent in the western part of the state 
in the corn belt and southeast winter wheat was fair to good 
with adequate moisture supplies the report said the crop was 
breaking dormancy in portions of the corn belt

the agriculture department says farmers who 
participated in the 1989 corn and sorghum programs will get 
subsidies totaling about 108 billion later this month 
most corn and sorghum producers requested advance payments at 
the time they signed up in last years program those included corn 
payments of 26 billion and sorghum payments 250 million john 
stevenson acting executive vice president of the commodity credit 
corp said tuesday 
payments now due farmers include about 780 million in corn 
deficiency payments and 145 million in 092 payments he 
said sorghum producers will get about 120 million in deficiency 
payments and 35 million in 092 payments 
deficiency payments are basically the difference between target 
prices and market prices or basic price support rate whichever is 
higher 
under the socalled 092 provision wheat and feed grains 
producers have the option of not planting on all or a portion of 
their permitted acreage and still collect payments for up to 92 
percent of their permitted crop acreage

teaching children to stay away from drugs 
requires a lot more than lectures from teachers says national drug 
policy director william j bennett it takes tough school policy 
community involvement and law enforcement too 
this is not about lock em up he said tuesday in a speech 
on drug education at george mason university in suburban fairfax 
va it is about establishing an environment in which good things 
flourish and bad things dont 
recounting a visit two weeks ago to a druginfested los angeles 
neighborhood where police barricaded certain areas and operated 
street patrols with local residents bennett said crime decreased 
as expected 
but something else happened too something you might not 
expect school attendance went up way up perhaps as many as 200 
additional students went to school once a police presence was 
established 
the police made it safe to go to school he said they 
moved kids from the streets back into the classroom if that isnt 
drug prevention then i dont know what is 
some critics have said bennett and the drug control strategy he 
developed is too weighted towards law enforcement with 71 percent 
of the proposed 106 billion drug budget for 1991 devoted to law 
enforcement and 29 percent to demand reduction including education 
and treatment 
but bennett said too many insist that our drug policy options 
force us to choose between enforcement and education thats wrong 
flatout wrong 
the former education secretary said education can provide the 
answer to turn young people away from drugs 
but he said education must be wellrounded and antidrug 
courses alone wont inoculate our children from the temptations 
of drug use 
they must be included in a balanced program that stresses 
resistance to peer pressure in a school that maintains rigid 
antidrug policies bennett said and he said they will work if the 
total effort in the school at home and in the community is on 
building character and selfesteem through hard work and 
achievement 
some mistakes have been made in past drug education efforts he 
said and one is to pretend that what adolescents need most is 
merely more information about drugs 
if anything wellpackaged information on drugs can even serve 
to pique youthful curiosity about them he said 
another mistake we have sometimes made is trying to scare 
children with drug horror stories he said but many students 
are too skeptical to believe them or too smart and aware to be 
persuaded that every drug encounter leads to fatal injury 
the most encouraging signs today come from drug education 
programs that stress peer resistance learning how to say no to 
peers he said 
tough school policies also play a strong role he said and the 
best are those which suspend students and notify their parents if 
they use drugs and which expel repeat offenders 
young people know hypocrisy when they see it bennett said 
if principals dont walk it like instructors talk it students 
will walk it as they wish talking a good game is insufficient 
to the task

the sr71 blackbird spy plane star of 
american aerial snooping for 25 years didnt look like museum 
material on its recordsetting final coasttocoast flight that 
took just over an hour 
but it soon will be to the regret of some admirers 
this is one of the first victims of the effort to scale back 
defense sen john warner rva said tuesday after blackbird 
no 17972 marked its retirement by whizzing from los angeles to 
washington dc in record time of 68 minutes 17 seconds not 
counting time for takeoff and landing it also set four other speed 
marks along the 2404mile route 
the air force is donating the plane to the smithsonian 
institution which plans to display it here at the washington 
dulles international airport wing of the national air and space 
museum 
the full blackbird fleet was officially retired two months ago 
warner the ranking republican on the senate armed services 
committee said the blackbird is still unmatched as a technological 
wonder but is being assigned to the junk heap because of a growing 
perception in the united states that military spending must be 
reduced as eastwest tensions ease 
i cannot honestly say this is a happy day for me said ben 
rich the lockheed aeronautical system co executive who helped 
design the black daggershaped plane 
rich said he had only one parting sentiment byebye 
blackbird 
congress in agreeing last fall with the air forces decision to 
retire the twinengine blackbirds said advances in technology 
enable satellites to do similar work more cheaply than the spy 
plane which first entered service in 1964 
doubts about the decision remain 
george carver jr an intelligence specialist at the center for 
strategic and international studies in washington said in a 
telephone interview that he doubted the wisdom of giving up an 
asset that has been extremely useful in providing intelligence 
data 
the blackbirds coasttocoast dash easily eclipsed the previous 
time record of 3 hours 38 minutes set in 1963 by a boeing 707 
the spy plane took a running start refueling over the pacific 
ocean at 60000 feet before heading east from the california 
coastline and crossing its finish line near salisbury md said 
malvern gross president of the national aeronautic association 
which certifies aviation records 
the blackbird then refueled before cruising in to dulles airport 
the flight also set three citytocity speed records 215324 
mph between los angeles and washington 224248 mph between st 
louis and cincinnati and 220094 mph between kansas city mo and 
washington the pilot was lt col ed yeilding and lt col jt 
vida was the reconnaissance systems officer 
it was one of the few public displays of a blackbird and 
despite the rush to publicize this final flight most details of 
the planes design and capabilities are still top secret the air 
force wont even say how many of the planes exist 
maj suzanne randle of the strategic air commands headquarters 
at offutt air force base neb said nine blackbirds are going to 
museums three are being mothballed at palmdale calif and three 
will be used by the national aeronautics and space administration 
for research ms randle said she could not say whether that 
accounted for all the planes 
the highflying blackbird regularly flew missions over heavily 
defended north vietnam and provided intelligence in many other 
regions including the middle east and china 
the plane can outrun the fastest fighters and has never been 
shot down built to withstand temperatures of more than 800 degrees 
fahrenheit its skin is a titanium alloy instead of the aluminum 
used on most airplanes it can sustain a speed of mach 3 or three 
times the speed of sound but its maximum speed is classified

the farmers lender of last resort the 
farmers home administration will be less lenient with delinquent 
borrowers if a bill approved by the house becomes law 
the house by voice vote tuesday passed legislation that would 
close loopholes in the 1987 agricultural credit act that lawmakers 
said caused abuse of the law 
weve discovered some farmers have found loopholes big enough 
to drive their tractors through said rep butler derrick dsc 
many of the abuses are downright scandalous 
the bills author rep glenn english dokla emphasized 
this is a very very small number of people we are talking 
about but he said some of the abuses have been 
multimilliondollar in scale 
the senate is writing a similar bill under the leadership of 
sen kent conrad dnd chairman of the agricultural credit 
subcommittee 
conrad said he doesnt expect any major obstacles and believes 
whatever difference might exist between the house and senate 
versions will be settled quickly in conference committee 
house members said the measure was an effort to make a program 
that was well intended work better 
since the act of 1987 became law it has helped thousands of 
ranchers and producers said rep thomas coleman rmo the 
bills cosponsor these amendments will strengthen the act 
the national family farm coalition however says the 
legislation threatens the small farmers existence and the 
national farmers union voted against the proposed changes at its 
national convention in oklahoma city on monday 
the credit act was designed to prevent fmha from forcing family 
farmers off their land if the government could make more money from 
a restructured loan than through the foreclosure and liquidation 
process 
the options available to the deeply indebted borrowers have been 
stretching out repayment consolidating loans reducing interest 
rates deferring payments and reducing the amount owed known as a 
writedown 
borrowers that fmha finds cannot manage a restructured loan have 
been able to keeps their property through a buyout paying only the 
net recovery value the appraised market value minus the amount 
fmha would have spent foreclosing on the property 
however both the congressional general accounting office and he 
inspector generals office in the agriculture department have said 
that fmha is vulnerable to even more losses than it already has 
sustained if its loanmaking and servicing procedures arent 
changed 
the gao says about half of fmhas 23 billion outstanding loans 
are owed by delinquent borrowers 
the bill approved by the house and supported by the bush 
administration would 
limit to 250000 the amount fmha could write down for any one 
borrower 
allow a borrower only one writedown and one net recovery buyout 
let the fmha consider all of the borrowers assets except 
those necessary for family living when calculating a writedown 
currently the agency only considers the assets used in calculating 
the original loan 
extend from two years to 10 years the time that the government 
has to collect profits made by farmers who sell their property 
after buying out their loan at net recovery value 
require borrowers to act in good faith as defined by fmha 
regulations to be eligible for net recovery buyouts 
extend the time periods in which borrowers may apply for 
restructuring in which fmha must process these applications and in 
which borrowers may exercise the option for a net recovery buyout

thomas is set to become a federal appeals judge after winning 
senate confirmation despite criticism from senior citizens and 
liberal groups 
i believe he will be an excellent judge sen john c 
danforth rmo said after the senate confirmed thomas on tuesday 
on a voice vote 
danforth who led the confirmation drive said the senate 
recognized in clarence thomas ability accomplishment and 
dedication to justice 
the senate as late as monday night had planned to take a roll 
call vote on thomas but called it off after it became obvious that 
it would be lopsided 
the 41yearold thomas becomes a judge of the us circuit court 
of appeals for the district of columbia which because of the 
highprofile cases that come before it is sometimes called the 
nations second highest court behind the supreme court 
his outspoken criticism of hiring quotas and affirmative action 
programs as chairman of the equal opportunity employment commission 
over the last eight years has won praise from conservatives 
liberals however were often critical of thomas one of the 
most visible black officials in the reagan and bush administrations 
danforth and other supporters stressed that thomas rose the hard 
way from a povertyridden farm in rural georgia to yale law school 
graduate and prominent federal official 
they also stressed what they described as his proven legal 
ability 
critics complained that the statute of limitations on thousands 
of agediscrimination cases lapsed with no action taken while 
thomas was in charge of the equal employment opportunity commission 
they said he failed to cooperate with congressional 
investigations of these lapses when thomas at his confirmation 
hearing sought to blame state and local fairemployment commissions 
for these lapses critics said he apparently did not know that 
these bodies were regulated by his own agency 
while critical of thomas on that point the american association 
of retired persons did not take a formal position on whether the 
senate should confirm thomas

soldiers led by the defense minister 
joined with moslem guerrillas tuesday to try to overthrow 
afghanistans government and diplomats said fighting continued in 
the countrys capital on wednesday 
kabul radio had reported tuesday night that the rebels were 
defeated by troops loyal to president najib but western diplomats 
said mutinous afghan air force pilots were still bombing loyalist 
positions in kabul wednesday morning 
there was also a lot of heavy antiaircraft fire to drive them 
away said one diplomat 
a second western diplomat said efforts to contact people in 
kabul on wednesday had been difficult it seems they are all 
hunkered down in their bunkers and that means there must be 
shooting in the streets of kabul 
both diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity 
afghanistans un envoy noor ahmad noor said in new york on 
tuesday that security forces were searching for the defense 
minister maj gen shah nawaz tanai noor told reporters at un 
headquarters that tanai was believed to be in hiding in the kabul 
vicinity 
shortly after tanai launched the coup attempt fundamentalist 
moslem rebel leader gulbaddin hekmatyar offered his support 
abdul haidi a spokesman of hekmatyars hezbiislami rebel 
group told the associated press on wednesday we are getting news 
from the kabul wireless that the fighting is still going on 
he claimed tanais forces controlled the airport but were under 
heavy rocket fire from troops loyal to najib haidi said moslem 
insurgents intercepted a radio broadcast between tanai forces at 
the airport and others from a base within the capital 
a radio kabul broadcast wednesday morning monitored in 
islamabad claimed government troops were in control of the defense 
ministry where tanai had earlier been reportedly orchestrating the 
coup attempt 
the broadcast also urged government loyalists to arm themselves 
and report to the nearest ruling party headquarters in the capital 
in order to guarantee the security of the people 
in the soviet union which sponsors the najib government the 
official news agency tass had reported that the coup attempt was 
crushed tuesday it claimed fighting had abated by nightfall and 
najibs forces were firmly in control 
western diplomats guerrilla leaders in pakistan and the soviet 
media reported heavy fighting tuesday and said afghan air force 
planes had bombed arg palace najibs headquarters in the heart of 
kabul 
heavy artillery and tanks fired for hours on the buildings of 
the defense ministry and the armys main political directorate 
tass said it also reported shelling of residential districts but 
said they abated after dusk 
un ambassador noor reported very very limited civilian 
casualties and said the number of people involved in the coup was 
said to be very small most rebels gave up and only a very 
limited number were killed he said 
tanai a hardline marxist was linked to at least of two of the 
five previous coup attempts reported against najib who took office 
in 1986 
najib said on state television tuesday night some soiled 
elements today tried to carry out a conspiracy and provoke 
bloodshed but the government forces have neutralized them they 
have been suppressed 
repeating a message broadcast earlier in the day by interior 
minister aslam watanjar who was named to replace tanai najib 
urged afghans to help capture the general dead or alive he 
said mutinous soldiers who surrendered by 4 am wednesday would be 
given amnesty 
ahmad sarwar afghan ambassador in new delhi said he spoke with 
najib by telephone tuesday night and the president sounded very 
strong and very confident 
he said everything is under control said sarwar whose wife 
is a sister to najibs wife he said najib told him one group of 
tanais followers had been killed and another captured 
najib did not say when the fighting started or mention where he 
was when the telephone contact was made sarwar said 
according to a source sarwar said some of tanais supporters 
bombed kabul from the air but no bombs fell within half a mile of 
najib or arg palace 
tuesdays attempted coup was the third said to involve tanai and 
hekmaytar 
hekmatyar a 42yearold engineer has broken with the 
guerrillas exile gpvernment formed a year ago in neighboring 
pakistan and has been accused by other resistance groups of killing 
rival guerrillas and innocent civilians 
he is among the most antiwest leaders of the seven insurgent 
groups but has received the bulk of us weapons during the 
12yearold civil war in afghanistan 
tanai a leader of the coup that installed a marxist government 
in april 1968 is said to have had many contacts with the moslem 
guerrillas 
reports circulated in july that tanai and hekmatyar were 
conspiring to overthrow najib the alleged coup plot was uncovered 
and tanai was either detained or put under house arrest briefly 
according to later reports 
the general believed to be in his 40s has opposed najibs 
peace overtures najib has made various offers to the guerrillas in 
an attempt to end the civil war but to no avail 
in december the government arrested 127 people who allegedly 
were planning a coup tanai was implicated but never charged and 
was said to have spent weeks under house arrest 
on monday 124 of those arrested went on trial in kabul 
including senior army officers the other three were released 
hekmatyar told reporters tuesday in islamabad he supports any 
attempt to oust najib if a coup succeeded he said the guerrillas 
would decide whether to negotiate for an islamic government or 
fight najibs successor 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov was asked 
in moscow tuesday what action the kremlin would take if najib was 
overthrown he replied we will just have to wait and see 
the red army entered afghanistan in december 1979 to help fight 
the war the last soviet forces withdrew on feb 15 1989 but the 
kremlin continues to provide massive aid

protected by security guards greyhound 
replacement drivers set out before dawn for a day on the open road 
in their rolling classrooms 
the course on how to drive a bus is one of four training 
operations set up by greyhound a month ago in anticipation of the 
strike begun friday by 6300 drivers and 3000 maintenance workers 
at americas only nationwide bus company 
a guard blocked access to visitors tuesday at the outoftheway 
motel parking lot from which the buses left a mechanic directed 
visitors to room 155 there a man with a greyhound id tag denied 
any training was going on 
finally in the room next door a man wearing a greyhound tie 
pin who like the others refused to identify himself 
acknowledged that this lot 30 miles south of richmond was the site 
of one of the training operations 
the trainees undergo a 21day program of classroom work and 
behindthewheel experience the unidentified greyhound employees 
said on tuesday the training buses were rolling to charleston 
sc a 10hour trip with stops along the way in 22 small towns 
liz hale a spokeswoman at company headquarters in dallas said 
the trainees have at least one year of experience in driving large 
trucks or buses 
but some strikers said the regimen was inadequate compared to 
the 12week course greyhound normally provides 
as much as i hate my exwife i wouldnt let her get on a bus 
driven by one of these replacements said a picket wearing a 
scab watcher hat outside the richmond terminal this week he 
refused to give his name 
greyhound estimated 700 replacement drivers are at work and 
claimed on tuesday to be running at 34 percent of its normal 
routes an additional 300 drivers graduate this week and some 
union drivers have crossed picket lines hale said 
the company has received 6500 applications to replace strikers 
greyhound said but 50 to 60 of the new drivers had quit in the 
first day or two of the strike because of intimidation by strikers 
company officials said 
we are not surprised by that said another greyhound 
spokesman george gravley these people were recruited and they 
were told honestly and forthrightly the nature of the work 
greyhound officials in dallas would not disclose the training 
locations but the associated press learned training was going on 
here and at indianapolis and sacramento calif the fourth training 
location was not immediately known 
chairman fred g currey said over the weekend that greyhound 
lines inc has millions of dollars in reserve and the advance 
training plans appeared to be a sign the company was girding for a 
long struggle with the strikers 
the replacements are being hired under the contract terms the 
strikers rejected including some pay increases contingent on 
increased ridership safety records and other productivity factors 
gravley said 
in indianapolis striking drivers shivered in the cold tuesday 
as they watched replacements learning to drive half a dozen 
security guards walked the perimeter of the training lot 
striker noah n young who has been driving a bus for 35 years 
and is 2 years away from retirement said indianapolis was 
selected as a training center because its a small union center

sen alfonse damato under scrutiny by the 
senate ethics committee is asking federal agencies to send him 
copies of any documents concerning him that have been released 
under the freedom of information act 
the request which an official at one department said could 
result in a paperwork nightmare if granted was made last month 
in a series of letters the new york republicans office sent to the 
14 cabinet departments and several other agencies 
damatos press secretary franklin l coleman who signed the 
letters said the intense local media scrutiny damato has received 
in recent months has often included questions about correspondence 
no longer quickly available to the senator because it has been sent 
to archives 
we made this request in order to be in a position to respond 
promptly and accurately to inquiries regarding correspondence our 
office generated to agencies in the past coleman said tuesday 
the letters on senate stationery said damatos office has 
received inquiries about correspondence and indications that 
similar requests for the documents had been filed with government 
agencies under the freedom of information act 
senator damato will as always want to be as responsive as 
possible to the media the letters said they asked that whenever 
documents mentioning or concerning the senator were released 
copies of that material also be provided to the senator 
simultaneously 
the associated press obtained a copy of the letter sent to the 
federal election commission and department of housing and urban 
development officials said hud had received an identical request 
coleman later confirmed sending the letters to all the major 
government departments and independent agencies 
the ethics committee is conducting a preliminary inquiry to 
determine whether it should begin a triallike investigation of a 
series of allegations made against damato by mark green his 
democratic election opponent in 1986 
green filed the complaint after numerous news accounts detailed 
the senators successful lobbying of hud officials for housing and 
other developments in new york and puerto rico including a 
425000 grant to pay for a swimming pool in damatos hometown of 
island park ny the pool project was canceled after a spate of 
bad publicity 
in several cases the developers who received damatos support 
were friends or major donors to his campaigns 
another allegation stemmed from a letter that damatos brother 
attorney armand damato drafted in the senators name to obtain 
information for a client unisys corp concerning a 100 million 
defense contract 
sen damato said he did not know about the letter and also has 
said that several letters to hud officials bearing his name were 
signed by staff without his knowledge 
in november damato said he was the victim of a pile on by 
the media adding i have nothing to be ashamed of 
coleman said tuesday he took it upon myself to write the 
letters to the agencies and did not tell the senator in advance 
he said he was not aware of any responses to the letters 
fred eiland spokesman for the federal election commission said 
the fec probably would deny the request on he ground it doesnt 
meet the requirements of the freedom of information act because it 
does not ask for a specific document or documents 
although colemans letter was not filed as an foia request 
eiland said the commission had decided to treat it as such 
eiland also said it was office policy to treat confidentially 
any media requests for research assistance we never ever tell 
another person what someone else is looking at he said its 
between us and the reporter 
hud has asked its legal staff to review what one agency official 
said were potentially troubling questions raised by damatos 
request 
under review was whether the department should grant such an 
openended request for copies of foia responses and if it decided 
to comply whether hud should identify the reporter or organization 
requesting the information 
the hud official speaking on the condition of anonymity said 
that if the department complied with the request it could receive 
similar letters from other members of congress reporters and 
others opening the door for a paperwork nightmare

a tax credit that encourages corporations to 
invest in lowincome rental units is the only game in town to 
help ease the housing crunch for the poor a lawmaker says 
rep charles rangel dny made that assessment tuesday at a 
news conference called to dramatize the need to make the low income 
housing tax credit permanent 
the chicagobased national equity fund a conduit for corporate 
investments using the credit said it used the endangered tax 
credit last year to invest 77 million in rental housing for 2000 
families 
thirtyfive corporations including banking and insurance 
giants invested the money it will be used as a lever to provide a 
total of 200 million worth of housing in 15 cities the fund said 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine and sen john 
danforth rmo have introduced legislation to make the tax credit 
permanent 
tax policy has had a negative effect by and large in the 
1980s said danforth referring to the impact of tax policy on 
lowincome housing programs its time to turn it around 
the credit was made part of the 1986 tax overhaul and was 
extended last year to the end of 1990 the bush administration has 
proposed an additional oneyear extension 
its really sad you have to use the income tax system to 
drive a social program rangel said but its the only game in 
town 
the equity fund is an affiliate of the local initiatives support 
corp a private nonprofit group dedicated to community 
development that was created by the ford foundation in 1979 
the first partnership created under the funds auspices invested 
1425 million from 13 corporations to create 857 housing units 
the fund said it raised 51 million from 40 corporations last year 
to develop more than 2000 units worth over 150 million 
the credits awarded over 10 years create 100000 units of 
lowincome housing each year it said

united press international is seeking 
arbitration of its claim that the reuters news service has deprived 
it of photo revenue for the past five years 
upi is seeking damages of more than 600000 for money it says 
was lost when some of its customers began buying photos from 
reuters instead 
upi filed its request for arbitration on tuesday with the 
international chamber of commerce court of arbitration in paris 
which will handle the case through an affiliate in new york 
the news service said reuters is obligated under agreements 
between the two companies to reimburse upi for any revenue lost as 
a result of upi subscribers shifting to reuters photo service 
a reuters spokesman robert crooke said there is no evidence 
upi lost money due to his companys marketing activities 
we welcome the opportunity that the arbitration provides to 
establish not only that reuter activities are not the cause of 
upis losses but that those causes lie much closer to upis own 
actions crooke said 
under an arrangement that began jan 1 1985 and was supposed 
to run for 10 years upi provided reuters with pictures from the 
united states while reuters supplied pictures from other countries 
reuters said feb 16 it was canceling the agreement and halted 
its flow of pictures to upi for more than four hours 
a us district judge in new york issued a temporary restraining 
order barring further such action by reuters the court has 
scheduled a hearing monday on upis request for a preliminary 
injunction against reuters attempts to end the photo arrangement 
reuters has alleged that upis photo service has declined since 
the exchange began

east german workers have won the right to 
strike for the first time in their countrys 40year history under 
a new labor law that also prohibits employers from locking out 
workers 
the law overwhelming approved tuesday by parliament comes as 
the country lurches ever closer to reunification with west germany 
legislators praised the new labor code for its mixing of 
marketstyle reforms with traditional socialist protections but 
they conceded that it probably would be objectionable to west 
german investors and employers 
the law easily won approval from the 385 lawmakers present for 
what is expected to be the last session of the 500member peoples 
chamber before the countrys first competitive elections on march 
18 only six voted against the measure with 53 abstentions debate 
was minimal 
the future of the new law may rest with the new 400member 
parliament many labor principles embodied in the law require 
implementing legislation that will have to be tackled after the new 
legislative body is seated 
the strike clause however is among changes to take effect next 
week 
lawmakers hailed the nolockout clause as a workers right not 
enjoyed in west germany 
because the law is likely to be seen as imbalanced by west 
german industries seeking to build plants or engage in joint 
production operations in east germany it may serve to slow the 
investment considered essential to turning around the flagging 
economy 
the law comes in the form of a constitutional change it permits 
unions to call strikes if arbitration fails to resolve 
labormanagement differences in negotiations 
strikes have been forbidden in east germany and most other 
formerly socialist states with labor unions traditionally 
powerless to challenge the communists who ruled until democratic 
upheavals toppled them last year 
the government now will have the right to intercede and stop a 
strike only if the walkout is deemed a threat to public order 
the law provides that no one can reduce or hinder unions in 
their rightful occupation 
communist lawmaker kaethe niederkirchner said such a broad 
protection was likely to disturb the capitalists next door he 
quoted west german employers association president klaus murmann as 
describing the law as a hindrance to intergerman economic 
cooperation 
parliament also adopted additional measures on election 
procedures including extending voting rights to foreigners who 
have lived in east germany for two years or more 
the changes are the latest since a popular uprising forced 
communist hardliner erich honecker to step down in october the 
opening of the berlin wall a month later and the introduction of 
noncommunists and opposition democratic reformers into the interim 
government

the rev bruce ritter founder of covenant 
house has admitted drawing 140000 from a taxexempt fund set up 
to benefit runaways 
the priest who resigned under pressure last week as president 
of the nations biggest network of runaway shelters told the new 
york times in a story today that he contibuted the money to the 
fund and took it out to cover his expenses and conduct his ministry 
the funds trustee edmund j burns told the times the 140000 
was given to the roman catholic priests franciscan order but 
ritter told the times the money actually went to him 
ritter said he had authorization from the franciscans to use the 
money for personal expenses 
the franciscan order said it did not know of the trust 
according to the times 
ritter said he eventually redeposited in the trust some of the 
money the trust had paid to him and told the times all the 
transactions were legal he said he began depositing 60000 of his 
98000ayear salary in the trust in 1986 to avoid criticism of 
his high pay 
but robert kobel a spokesman for the internal revenue service 
said that under the law a person cannot give money to a trust with 
the idea of taking it back 
ritter has been accused of other financial improprieties and 
four young men have alleged in published reports that he had sexual 
affairs with them 
the state attorney generals office is investigating 
transactions involving the trust and covenant houses board of 
directors told attorney general robert abrams the trust would be 
dismantled 
on tuesday the times reported that the trust was not registered 
with the state and that funds from it had been used to make loans 
to two covenant house board members and ritters sister

the key index on the tokyo stock exchange plunged 
wednesday while the dollar was sharply higher against the yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average lost 42874 points or 127 
percent ending the day at 3336234 it had dropped 5412 points 
tuesday 
the dollar closed at 15075 yen up 125 yen from tuesdays 
close at 14950 yen it opened at 15025 yen and ranged between 
15025 yen and 15098 yen 
discouraged by the yens weakness the benchmark 10year no 119 
japanese government bond price fell to 8667 points as of 3 pm 
down 041 points from tuesdays close at 8708 its yield rose to 
7200 percent up from the previous daya 7115 percent 
this is a triplelow situation with declines in all the 
markets stock foreign exchange and bonds said masayoshi yano 
a dealer with nikko securities co 
yano said the yens decline as well as renewed speculation over 
a rise in the nations discount rate discouraged many investors 
japans leading economic newspaper nihon keizai shimbun said 
the bank of japan will raise its official discount rate from the 
current 425 percent by as much as one percentage point as early as 
next week 
market players have expected the central bank to raise its key 
lending rate since shortly after the nations general election last 
month analysts have blamed uncertainties and speculations 
involving the rate for recent plunges in the stock market 
yano said computer programaided arbitrage selling mainly by 
foreign securities firms accelerated the nikkeis drop wednesday 
arbitrage is a technique of trading in the stock and futures 
markets simultaneously to profit from price differentials between 
them 
program trading has been blamed aiding recent declines though 
foreign brokers have denied it has had a significant effect on the 
market 
shortly after the nikkei fell 156910 points feb 26 the tokyo 
stock exchange requested that securities firms limit program 
trading to the opening minutes of the morning and the afternoon 
sessions until thursday 
as the deadline approaches nobody seems to be following the 
request yano said 
in currency dealings the dollar remained strong following its 
surge on overseas markets dealers said 
the dollar surpassed the 150yen line in sydney before tokyo 
market opened and it rose further as speculative japanese 
investors bought dollars and sold the yen said koichiro amaya a 
trader with chemical bank in tokyo 
the dollars surge halted when it neared 151 yen as the bank of 
japan was seen intervening in the market traders said the bank 
sold about 1 billion in the morning session in an effort to halt 
the dollars further rise the bank does not officially comment on 
its market interventions 
but the dollar is strong and there is nothing to encourage 
dollarselling except for the bank of japans intervention

the government says parents should not let 
infants sleep on small pillows or cushions filled with plastic foam 
beads because 10 babies using the items have suffocated in two 
years 
however the consumer product safety commission declined to 
identify the products or companies tuesday saying negotiations for 
a recall were continuing 
at least 10 infants have died since december 1987 with seven of 
the deaths occurring since june the commission said all of the 
victims were 3monthsold or younger 
the agency said it was unusual for so many deaths associated 
with a relatively new product to occur over such a short period 
the cushions which became popular items for infants over the 
past few years are supposed to be a comfort for babies because 
they adjust to the contours of an infants body government 
officials said 
the cushions about 24 inches long and 12 inches wide resemble 
pillows or small bean bags the agency said usually made from 
quilted fabric the cushions are loosely filled with plastic foam 
beads or pellets 
the commission which urged parents not to leave children on the 
pillows unattended said it believes the products are made and sold 
by at least 10 companies

on tuesday it reached 250000000 according to estimates by the 
census bureau 
a more detailed total will be calculated following the national 
head count to be taken april 1 
the 250 million estimate is a 104 percent increase from the 
2265 million americans counted in 1980 
the us population reached 50 million in 1880 doubled to 100

the senate ethics committee is not counting on 
pleabargain negotiations with sen david durenberger and plans to 
move ahead with triallike proceedings according to sources 
familiar with the case 
one source speaking only on condition of anonymity said 
tuesday the committee would not be placing its main focus on 
the hearings if serious negotiations to settle the case were under 
way 
no date has been set for the hearings sources said because the 
committee is still conducting a preliminary investigation into 
senate reimbursements durenberger received for a condominium he 
partly owned 
the committee set the stage last week for the hearings when it 
formally notified the minnesota republican there was substantial 
credible evidence of five specific rules violations and a sixth 
governing general conduct expected of a senator 
durenberger who has admitted mistakes in judgment but no 
willful wrongdoing may have violated outside income limits and 
other rules in his promotion of two books he wrote the committee 
said he also potentially violated annual limits on receipt of 
gifts when he accepted nearly 5000 worth of limousine trips for 
personal travel in 1985 and 1986 the panel said 
the committee is in the final stage of the durenberger 
investigation which normally would end with a determination of 
whether rules were broken a guilty finding could lead the panel to 
recommend disciplinary action to the senate including censure 
loss of seniority or expulsion 
durenberger however could decide at any time that he wants to 
negotiate a settlement rather than defend himself at a trialtype 
hearing 
a plea bargain would likely involve an admission by durenberger 
that violations took place and would shortcircuit the final phase 
of the probe it could end the case without a recommendation from 
the committee to the senate 
durenbergers spokeswoman carrie collins had no comment on the 
senators defense strategy 
under ethics committee rules the panel must give durenberger 
an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends 
disciplinary action to the senate 
however one source said the committee is planning to go ahead 
with the hearing whether durenberger requests one or not because 
it is in the public interest 
the panel announced feb 22 that the committee is continuing 
its preliminary inquiry on reimbursements durenberger received 
for rent on a minneapolis condominium he partly owned 
to include the condominium arrangement in the triallike 
hearing the committee would have to find substantial credible 
evidence of a violation

president daniel ortega says that as 
one of its last acts his outgoing sandinista government will 
abolish a news censorship law and allow the establishment of 
private television stations 
speaking tuesday before us and latin american publishers at a 
meeting of the inter american press association ortega said he 
would introduce a bill in the national assembly to repeal the much 
criticized censorship law 
ortega and his leftist sandinistas were beaten feb 25 by the 
14party united national opposition coalition led by violeta 
barrios de chamorro 
abolishing the censorship law one of ortegas last acts in the 
national assembly as president would allow either the 
sandinistas uno or others to start up a televison station tv 
broadcasting is now in government hands 
mrs chamorro publisher of the only opposition newspaper la 
prensa championed turning over government control of television 
during the sandinistas 10year rule 
a law passed in april 1989 ended prior restraint of news and the 
right to indefinitely close newspapers and radio stations but it 
maintained the governments tv monopoly 
the law also kept up punishment for altering state press 
releases or publishing information contrary to the interests of 
nicaragua

the dollar rose sharply against the yen today in 
tokyo despite active intervention by the bank of japan while the 
chief index on the tokyo stock exchange dropped 
the dollar closed at 15075 yen up 125 yen from tuesdays 
close of 14950 yen it opened at 15025 yen its low for the day 
and ranged as high as 15098 yen 
the dollar rose from its opening level as market players 
predicted the bank of japan would not raise its official discount 
rate in the near future traders said 
many market players now think that the central bank will put 
off the hike because it could hurt the stock market badly said 
kenzo shinomiya a trader with fuji bank higher interest rates 
tend to depress stock prices 
analysts have said a discount rate hike could be unwise because 
of a series of recent declines in the stock market the 225issue 
nikkei stock average the main index on the tokyo stock exchange 
has lost 512479 points or 132 percent so far this year mainly 
due to uncertainties over the discount rate increase and to 
computerlinked trading 
shinomiya said few people except for the bank of japan and a 
small number of profittakers were selling the dollar demand for 
the dollar is very strong and it will rise as high as 155 yen 
he said 
discouraged by the yens weakness the price of benchmark 
10year no 119 japanese government bonds fell to 8667 points as 
of 3 pm down 041 points from tuesdays close of 8708 their 
yield rose to 72 percent up from the previous daya 7115 percent 
on the stock exchange the nikkei index fell 42874 points or 
127 percent ending the day at 3336234 it had dropped 5412 
points tuesday 
nomura securities analyst yoshio inoue blamed the drop in stock 
and bond prices on the yens weakness 
its all because of the discount rate which has not risen 
despite investors expectations he said 
market players have expected the central bank would raise its 
official discount rate after general elections last month and 
analysts have blamed the markets recent decline in part on 
uncertainties over the key interest rate 
the discount rate hike has gradually been factored into the 
market but the problem is its timing inoue said 
this is a triplelow situation with declines in all the 
markets stock foreign exchange and bonds said masayoshi yano 
a dealer with nikko securities co 
he said a frontpage story today in the financial newspaper 
nihon keizai shimbun saying the bank of japan would raise its 
official discount rate from the current 425 percent by as much as 
1 percentage point as early as next week discouraged stock 
investors 
inoue said the index which fell even farther in the morning 
remained low as individual investors continued to sell issues while 
very few participants were buying 
dealers attributed the indexs early decline to programaided 
arbitrage selling initiated by foreign securities firms such as 
morgan stanley salomon brothers and shearson lehman 
the last day for futures issues due in march is scheduled for 
tomorrow so i expect continuing arbitrage selling until the end of 
tomorrow yano said 
arbitrage is a technique of trading in two markets for example 
spot and futures simultaneously to profit from price differentials 
between them 
computeraided arbitrage selling has been blamed for recent 
market plunges although foreign brokers have denied that the 
technique has had a significant effect on the market the tokyo 
stock exchange requested shortly after the nikkeis 156910point 
fall feb 26 that securities firms limit their arbitrage deals to 
the opening minutes of the morning and the afternoon sessions until 
thursday

two undercover officers wounded in a shootout 
with drug dealers were hit by police fire one man from his own 
gun and investigators may never know whose bullet killed a third 
officer authorities say 
the gun battle took place monday at a housing project during a 
cocaine buy involving two dealers 
right from the getgo it was a ripoff a police spokesman 
inspector richard mayronne said tuesday he said it was clear it 
was a ripoff because the room into which one of the detectives was 
taken had no way out 
state police investigator joseph t aversa 31 was slain two 
city detectives craig moruzzi 41 and joseph mendez 29 suffered 
leg wounds 
the three were members of the new york drug enforcement task 
force which includes city state and federal officers 
authorities and police sources said aversas fire struck 
moruzzi and that mendez shot himself in a struggle with one dealer 
for control of the detectives gun 
we cant determine who hit aversa mayronne said its 
very possible investigators never will find out he added 
authorities did not rule out the possibility that a stray police 
bullet killed aversa they said their investigation was hampered 
because the bullet which entered aversas left eye and exited 
behind his ear was not recovered 
david hernandez 20 and oswaldo santana 27 were arrested 
monday in the afternoon gunfight and charged with murder attempted 
murder and robbery juan jose peralta 23 was arrested tuesday on 
cocaine charges in the case 
santana was shot in the toe hernandez in the elbow and abdomen 
his injuries were not considered life threatening 
mayronne refused to say how many bullets were fired during the 
gunfight 
the new york times today quoted unidentified highranking 
officials as saying the three officers fired a total of 12 shots 
while between them the two suspects fired one the daily news said 
the officers fired 14 shots 
hernandez was the only one of the dealers who was armed police 
said 
authorities said the shootings occurred when the dealers tried 
to rob the officers during a cocaine buyandbust detectives had 
negotiated earlier to buy more than four pounds of cocaine for 
46000 authorities said 
its extremely risky at both ends of the spectrum because when 
you buy drugs youre going into the mouth of the tiger said 
assistant police chief john hill head of the departments 
narcotics division 
its dangerous but its the main tool in our arsenal very 
successful

thousands of haitianamericans protested the new 
federal ban on blood donations by haitians saying the aids 
prevention policy would increase discrimination against them 
after the rally by about 8000 people tuesday the food and drug 
administration responded by promising to consult with 
haitianamericans and convene a public meeting of its blood 
products advisory committee to discuss the issue 
the haitian immigrants gathered in a dusty field across from fda 
offices here chanting fda racists waving redandblue 
haitian flags and carrying signs saying fda bigots must go 
police arrested three people when the crowd surged onto fda 
property 
anyone can die from aids from the president to the poorest 
man i dont see why they blame the haitians said jean francois 
a college student 
the policy announced last month is designed to help keep 
aidstainted blood out of the nations supply by requiring blood 
banks to refuse donations from people who were born in or who 
emigrated from haiti and subsaharan africa 
protesters claim the policy unfairly lumps them with the other 
groups discouraged from giving blood intravenous drug users 
homosexuals and prostitutes 
this is an acquired disease its behavioral said philomena 
jadotte 24 a nursing student who emigrated from haiti 10 years 
ago there are more hispanics dying of aids in miami than 
haitians why are we being singled out because were black 
many haitians already feel unwanted in south florida because of 
us immigration policy that welcomes cuban and nicaraguan emigres 
but returns most haitians to their impoverished violent homeland 
a previous ban permitted blood donations from haitians and 
subsaharan africans only if they emigrated before 1977 but the 
fda changed its policy after research cast doubt on the reliability 
of that date as an indicator of when the disease began to spread 
outside the united states said fda spokesman brad stone 
unlike other groups most haitians who have aids got the fatal 
disease through heterosexual transmission and stone said theres 
no good way to screen potential carriers from the rest of the 
haitian population 
local officials in 1988 said that about onethird of the black 
sufferers of aids in florida were born in haiti 
we hope that people wont unfairly stigmatize 
haitianamericans as a result of this policy stone said by 
telephone from washington 
wed like to find ways to refine the process so we could ask 
questions and screen out those who would be at higher risk

a state lawmaker easily fended off a 
recall attempt by opponents of spearfishing rights for wisconsins 
chippewa indians 
rep james holperin the first state lawmaker to face a recall 
since 1932 won 9535 votes or 69 percent to 4380 or 31 percent 
for businessman gene ahlborn in the special democratic race tuesday 
holperin still faces brian sherren a resort owner in a recall 
election april 3 sherren 40 ran unopposed in the gop primary and 
garnered 601 votes 
ahlborn 50 conceded defeat and said he was extremely happy 
i certainly wasnt looking for a job 
it was a referendum on treaty rights and if thats what the 
people want i guess i can live with it he said it looks to 
me like they want to roll over and play dead 
the recall campaign was the work of groups opposed to indian 
spearfishing a right that was granted to the states chippewas in 
19th century treaties with the us government a 1983 federal 
court ruling also gave the indians rights to cut timber hunt and 
gather food off the reservation 
spearfishermen harvest the fish each spring as the spawn it is 
an extremely efficient fishing method and outdoorsmen and those in 
the tourism industry fear it will reduce the population of walleyed 
pike for sports fishing 
the issue has caused years of unrest in northern wisconsin last 
april and may hundreds of sportsmen showed up at lakes during the 
threeweek spearfishing season some threw rocks or shouted ethnic 
slurs at the indians 
holperin 39 a former radio and tv newscaster was elected to 
the assembly in 1982 
organizers of the recall were especially critical of his support 
last year for republican gov tommy g thompsons plan to pay a 
chippewa band 50 million in cash and other aid over 10 years to 
curtail exercise of their treaty rights tribal members voted down 
the plan 
dean crist a spokesman for stop treaty abusewisconsin the 
antispearfishing group that circulated the petitions for recall 
said his group had not supported either candidate in the race 
the purpose of sta was to send a message that we were 
unhappy crist said 
in wisconsins last recall election 58 years ago republican 
sen otto mueller retained his seat

a contra leader insisted after 
talks with a representative of nicaraguas new government that the 
sandinistas cede control of the countrys military before the 
rebels quit their fight and return home 
the statement tuesday by oscar sovalbarro chief of the contra 
team discussing the rebels eventual demobilization came hours 
after outgoing nicaraguan president daniel ortega said any attempt 
to include contra officers in the army would unleash a national 
war 
the leftist sandinistas say the armys revolutionary nature and 
role is enshrined in the constitution and that the constitution 
must be reformed before the army can be changed 
the usbacked contras accuse the sandinistas who which lost 
the feb 25 presidential and legislative elections of scheming to 
retain power by refusing to hand over military command 
what were saying is that for there to be true reconciliation 
in nicaragua it is important that the military forces be disarmed 
the army that exists in nicaragua is not a national army it is the 
army of a political party and it must disappear said 
sovalbarro who commented after a meeting between contra commanders 
and an aide to presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro 
the rebels also issued a statement accusing the sandinista air 
force of indiscriminate bombing of eight villages in the 
northwestern province of nueva segovia they accused the 
sandinistas of trying to convince the people of nicaragua and 
world opinion that these are defensive operations against the 
contras 
the sandinistas earlier tuesday had accused contra forces of 
attacking sandinista positions in northern nicaragua 
jaime cuadra mrs chamorros representative described the 
talks as preliminary and said no accord on demobilization was 
reached 
the date for demobilization of 4000 contras inside nicaragua 
and thousands more in honduran camps has emerged as a major 
stumbling block to a peaceful transfer of power in nicaragua 
we support dona violeta and she will decide after april 25 
what to do with the sandinistas and what to do with the armed 
forces sovalbarro said 
sovalbarro and pepe matus legal adviser to the contras 
outlined what they said was a contra proposal that could lead to 
demobilization 
they suggested contra forces should march with their weapons 
from their honduran camps to nicaraguan enclaves which they 
would occupy under international supervision 
we see that as very favorable as it provides a solution to 
the problem of occupation of honduran territory said sovalbarro 
honduras has been a reluctant host to the contras in recent 
years president rafael callejas said last week the rebels should 
leave as soon as possible 
the united states which helped form the contras in the early 
1980s and sustained them through the decade said last week that 
immediate measures should be taken to achieve the contras 
demobilization but the state department also said the rebels must 
enjoy full guarantees regarding personal and economic security 
before disbanding 
mrs chamorro who has pledged to end the draft and cut back the 
size of the military on tuesday called for a demilitarized central 
america 
in a meeting in northern costa rica with its president oscar 
arias she called for his support for regional demilitarization

the slaying of a texas racing commission 
official shot to death with his wife and two children at their home 
has been ruled a suicide 
but police said they have not yet determined whether 41yearold 
david joost also killed his wife susan 35 and their children 
ages 10 and 5 
medical examiner robert bayardo on tuesday said that joost who 
handled administrative duties for the racing commission died of a 
selfinflicted gunshot wound to the chest all four victims died 
early sunday he said 
sheriff paul hastings said no suicide note had been found but 
that the pressure of joosts job may have led him to kill himself 
he basically had an extremely difficult job the sheriff 
said 
sheriffs spokeswoman rachel vasquez said officials could not 
confirm whether the same 38caliber handgun killed all four family 
members 
the case is still under investigation so all we can assume at 
this point is that we have three homicides and one suicide ms 
vasquez said 
joosts body was discovered monday at his home in buda outside 
austin after he failed to show at a commission meeting mrs joost 
worked for the surface mining and reclamation division of the texas

settling the score tuesday on an issue that had led to a 
fistfight between two selectmen and intensified a 12year feud 
between two families the town voted 269111 to allow ruperts only 
general store to sell beer and wine 
the green mountain town was one of hundreds of northern new 
england communities holding town meetings the latewinter 
democratic ritual in which residents speak their mind on matters 
from snowplow routes to school policy 
in vernon neighbors of vermonts only nuclear plant voted 
monday to support a lowlevel radioactive waste site near the 
plant vermont is the only state with a nuclear power plant that 
has no place to put such waste 
in the coastal maine town of penobscot residents overwhelmingly 
rejected a plan tuesday to abolish local property taxes and finance 
town services instead through voluntary payments and user fees the 
town budget is 12 million a year 
residents felt if you didnt have to pay if you just ask your 
conscience the town would crumble said royce perkins architect 
of the notax plan he said the vote was approximately 23515 
against the proposal 
in rupert with a population just over 600 a rejection of 
alcohol sales would have forced residents to travel six miles or 
more to buy their beer and wine and made the town one of only six 
dry communities in vermont 
the town was dry until voters in 1981 narrowly approved the sale 
of beer and wine 
but many felt the real issue on the ballot had more to do with 
the family feud than the issue of wet vs dry 
its really just a grudge match said rupert selectman jay 
wilson jr who had pushed for an end to beer and wine and ended up 
losing his 32year seat 221156 
he said the feud began when john pelton charged that wilsons 
son now town road commissioner and several of his friends were 
taking gasoline from the town garage for their personal use pelton 
is the owner of ruperts only general store 
pelton is not the only one feuding with the wilsons 
edward lewis said his road is the last to get plowed by wilsons 
son because he has challenged the elder wilson for the selectmans 
seat 
the rev paul mychack of the church of christ said some 
residents have been against me mindlessly because he took 
another of wilsons sons to court 11 years ago

the citys schools chancellor wants to set up 
elementary schools inside office buildings so youngsters can learn 
with their parents nearby 
joseph a fernandez touted the plan tuesday as a way to improve 
employee performance and attendance while easing school 
overcrowding and integrating classes in the nations biggest school 
district with about 1 million students 
fernandez set up similar satellite learning centers in 1988 
while he ran the miami school system 
the school system would supply teachers while the company would 
provide the space for classes of at least 25 children from 
prekindergarten through second grade at each workplace 
its conceivable that in a satellite learning center you could 
have the vice presidents kid sitting next to the janitors kid 
he said its also conceivable you could get some of our middle 
class to start bringing back their kids to our schools 
fernandez who hopes to have a pilot program going by september 
said that at the first such center a kindergarten at a miami 
insurance company employee turnover dropped from 11 percent to 4 
percent within a year

the fbi is harassing a decorated agent with 
allegations of espionage to sabotage an investigation into 
antihispanic bias at the bureau the agents attorney says 
fernando mata is on paid leave with his security clearance 
revoked but has not been advised of any charges his lawyer hugo 
rodriguez said tuesday 
mata a 15year fbi veteran in counterintelligence who received 
the justice departments top award in 1983 has undergone repeated 
polygraph exams about his career since being suspended six weeks 
ago said rodriguez 
the test results have been favorable for mata the lawyer said 
said 
the new york times reported monday that mata was being 
investigated for unauthorized contacts with cuban agents 
rodriguez said he could not discuss specifics of the allegations 
against mata because he is under a nationalsecurity gag order but 
he said fernando mata is not a spy they know that everyone 
knows that 
the fbi would not comment other than to say this action is 
totally unrelated to agent matas participation in a discrimination 
classaction lawsuit 
mata 48 was a key witness in a successful 1988 suit by 311 
hispanic agents who accused the bureau of bias in hirings 
promotions and discipline a texas federal judge set up a panel 
headed by former us rep barbara jordan to review promotions to 
rule out discrimination 
it is very ironic that those hearings are going to go forth 
next month and that allegations against mr mata and other agents 
are all of a sudden surfacing rodriguez said 
he said more minor administrative actions had been taken against 
about 10 others involved in the lawsuit including agents in el 
paso and san antonio texas los angeles san juan puerto rico 
and atlanta 
rodriguez said he will file additional charges of harassment 
with us district judge lucius bunton in texas who has 
jurisdiction over the lawsuit 
about 425 hispanic agents serve among the fbis 10000 
employees said rodriguez himself a former agent

protesters were from outside london 
it is rentamob trotskyites who attend most of these 
demonstrations he contended in an interview on british

socialists who take on any issue to have a go at the police he 
said 
steve nally secretary of the all britain antipoll tax 
federation said he sympathized with the farleft militant group

we dont condone the violence that has gone on but we 
understand people are very angry about this issue he said on the 
same program 
the citizens were backed by their representatives in the house 
of commons where michael martin of the opposition labor party told 
prime minister margaret thatcher your friends are deserting you 
why dont you give up this irrational obsession to implement the 
poll tax 
mrs thatcher whose waning popularity has been blamed in part 
on the tax again blamed local councils for spending too much money 
and thus forcing taxes to be increased

was not for himself but for the hundreds of thousands of poor 
people who are worse off than i am 
robert orme lectured magistrates in stroud gloucestershire that 
the magna carta signed by king john at runnymede in 1215 requires 
general consent to any tax 
this government appears to have general dissent he said 
the average english household will pay 170 pounds 280 more 
under the community charge than under the property tax it replaces 
an increase from 837 to 1112 the bbc said tuesday 
the figures were calculated by the chartered institute of public

hotels this month are charging 
steep security deposits to make guests think twice about tossing 
furniture out the windows 
paintings that normally hang in lobbies and hallways now sit 
safely in storage 
otherwise the tolerance level for disorder has risen with the 
noise level as spring break and its hordes of beerdrinking 
hormonedriven students arrive at this resort island 
myndy michaels 20 a sunbathing ball state student said 
tuesday that she and her sorority sisters had stayed buzzed for 
about 24 hours on a drink called whammies 
padre is the best place to party because its not like a meat 
market and theres no rules she said and this is my new 
bathing suit 
noon had yet to arrive but fresh kegs of beer were planted in 
the sand near volleyball nets sun reflected off rows of 
suntanoiled young women and the ubiquitous dayglow beach wear 
we switched into what we call a spring break mode as of last 
saturday said craig vogel sales director of the sheraton south 
padre island beach resort we abandoned being a threestar hotel 
and turned into a spring break hotel 
that means the hotels convention and brunch areas will shut 
down for the month and that getting a room requires a 
50perperson deposit paintings plants and other portable 
objects have been moved out of hightraffic areas 
island promoters say they expect up to 200000 spring breakers 
over a nineweek period that began the last week of february the 
student population reaches its peak from march 1024 when many 
texas schools are out said geri jean wilson director of the south 
padre island visitor amp convention bureau 
some resort areas particularly in florida in recent years have 
grown weary of the rowdy students and established strict ordinances 
to discourage spring breakers 
not so in south padre island a town of about 1000 permanent 
residents near the mexican border 
south padre island welcomes spring breakers and we extend an 
invitation to them ms wilson said we look at it as if were 
creating brand loyalty right now 
police chief ed sanders says his 17 officers tend to leave the 
students alone police did however arrest nearly 1000 of the 
students last year most for severe public intoxication and 
disorderly conduct 
mexican officials have started a voluntary signin program for 
spring breakers as a means of keeping track of whos there said 
antolin licona lopez immigration director for the mexican 
government in matamoros 25 miles south of here 
he said the program was not created because of the disappearance 
and cult murder last march of university of texas student mark 
kilroy who was found buried near matamoros along with 14 other 
victims 
judging by the high occupancy rate at the island the cult 
murders dont appear to have affected the spring break business

japans nec corp and american telephone amp 
telegraph co today announced an agreement to cooperate in 
developing and manufacturing a wide range of semiconductors and 
other technologies 
the agreement will greatly enhance the us corporations access 
to japans worlddominating electronics market 
nec the worlds largest maker of semiconductors agreed to 
cooperate with atampts microelectronics division on various projects 
for at leat five years 
under the agreement atampt microelectronics will receive a 
license to market design and produce nec gatearray computer 
chips which can be used for a wide variety of applications because 
they are programmable 
an important feature of this agreement is that customers of 
both companies will enjoy the advantage of having two stable 
sources of identical gatearray products said william warwick 
president of atampt microelectronics 
from atampt nec will receive our most sophisticated 
computeraided design tools warwick told a news conference 
he said the two companies are working on accelerating the 
placement of atampt microelectronics semiconductor products into a 
variety of nec products such as communications systems and 
computers 
atampt microelectronics which is based in berkeley heights nj 
also will provide manufacturing support for certain nec microchips 
that are widely used in consumer electronics products 
this will allow japanese customers to obtain products made by 
an american firm and will give atampt a greater presence in the 
japanese market especially with consumer electronics companies 
warwick said 
the agreement will benefit customers of both companies through 
the strength of product lines and capabilities and enhancing of 
business opportunities he said 
tomohir matsumura nec executive vice president and director of 
its semiconductor division said computer chips are often referred 
to in japan as the staple food or crude oil of the 
electronics industry 
this agreement shows that one single company cannot stand 
alone and needs more resources to survive matsumura said 
it makes sense for atampt as a big semiconductor user to go to 
nec a big semiconductor producer said charles elliott an 
electronics analyst with the investment firm goldman sachs but 
atampt is also a big semiconductor developer and it makes sense for 
atampt to design and nec to produce 
neither of the executives would attach monetary figures to the 
accord but warwick said he was confident it would be continued 
after five years 
its long enough to indicate to our customers that our access 
to gatearray technology is not a onegeneration access warwick 
said i have no doubts it will grow and continue indefinitely 
the agreement will facilitate necs policy of increasing 
purchases of foreign semiconductors to ease trade friction 
us officials angered by what they claim is a closed japanese 
market to foreign semiconductors say japan agreed to boost the 
foreign share of the semiconductor market here to 20 percent by 
july 1991 
but foreign chips share stood at only 129 percent in the final 
quarter of 1989 according to the ministry of international trade 
and industry 
nec expects to purchase 53 million worth of atampt 
semiconductors in 1990 and more in 1991 though there is no target 
figure for next year nec spokeswoman akiko sato said 
the manufacturer plans to raise its internal use of foreign 
computer chips from the current 20 percent to 23 percent by july 
1991 when the usjapan semiconductor accord expires and to some 
24 percent by the end of next year miss sato said 
the necatampt accord reflects an increasing trend toward 
corporate tieups in the semiconductor industry 
atampt microelectronics announced two weeks ago that it will 
produce semiconductor memory chips for the international market in 
a joint venture with mitsubishi electric corp another major 
japanese chip manufacturer 
international business machines corp said in january that it 
would set up a joint venture with siemens ag of west germany to 
develop advanced memory chips

supporting terrorist groups in the region and claimed syrian 
leaders were behind the bombing of pan am flight 103 over scotland 
in december 1988 
emec the son of a newspaper publisher was known for his 
liberal views and often criticized the moslem fundamentalist 
minority in turkey 
a month ago a gunman shot and killed a prominent turkish 
jurist muammer aksoy at the entrance to his house in the capital 
city ankara a previously unknown moslem fundamentalist group 
calling itself the islamic revenge organization claimed 
responsibility for that shooting 
callers to newspaper offices said aksoy was punished for his 
opposition to the islamic style of dress for women which requires 
covering from head to toe police could not verify the claim 
a wave of terrorism in late 1970s claimed 5000 lives in turkey 
and triggered a military takeover in 1980 that lasted three years

in a country where not everybody can 
get a telephone a sumptuous illegally built luxury hideaway for 
top army brass had phones in the sauna and on docks within arms 
reach of fishing generals 
a lieutenant colonel promoted himself after receiving a defense 
ministry invitation that mistakenly identified him as a full 
colonel he was allowed to keep the extra star after complaining 
that removing it from his epaulets would make him a laughing stock 
a new book by col imre bokor is full of such anecdotes about 
the hungarian army some funny others frightening but all 
calculated to expose three decades of stupidity and corruption in 
high places 
bokor 59 was retired less than a week after publication of his 
book petty monarchs in uniform which depicts former defense 
minister lajos czinege as an inept and corrupt warlord who beat his 
adjutant and took large tracts of state property for his own use 
the book says czinege created a private game reserve on state 
land put up 80 miles of fence and stocked the area with deer and 
other trophy animals highranking visitors tested their 
marksmanship from army helicopters or czineges special 
fourwheeldrive vehicle with a rotating seat and riflerest 
some of his generals are described as alcoholics who danced on 
banquet tables laden with food and drink or slept for hours in 
moving defense ministry elevators others are accused of emulating 
czinege by building luxurious private homes with army manpower and 
materials 
the book depicts one general who had no medical training as 
donning a doctors robe on a voyeuristic excursion to a womens 
ward in a military hospital 
senior government officials have said most of the allegations 
are true as did a parliamentary committee set up specifically to 
deal with bokors accusations 
in a report made public march 1 the committee condemned the 
past communist practice of choosing leaders on the basis of 
political reliability instead of competence and qualifications 
saying it led to the selection of the unfittest 
it recommended that the supreme public prosecutor consider 
criminal charges against those accused of the greatest 
transgressions 
even defense minister ferenc karpati has described the 
allegations as largely true he has offered to reactivate 
bokor but the softspoken colonel now wants nothing to do with an 
army he feels was betrayed by much of its senior staff 
he told of harassment following publication of the book in 
november both by superiors trying to pressure him to retract his 
allegations and by others 
i received several dozen anonymous death threats in the first 
weeks that the book was available he told a reporter adding 
that he now carried a handgun as a result it got to the point 
where my poor wife didnt want to answer the phone 
the book appeared at a time of increasing debate about the 
future of the army with hungary beginning to replace decades of 
following moscows lead with indepedendent strategic goals as it 
evolves into a democracy 
the army had a strength of 106000 in the early 1980s and its 
mission was largely to act with other warsaw pact forces 
bokors allegations of poor leadership followed assertions by 
others that the army would have been unable to muster an 
indepedendent defense of the country in recent years 
with few exceptions the transport vehicles are in terrible 
shape and commanders are relieved if the vehicles manage to get 
outside camp gates lt gen mihaly toeroek secretary of 
parliaments defense committee declared on feb 12 the army 
has no suitable organization capable of independent military 
activity 
some of the books key figures have remained on active duty 
czinege who has denied wrongdoing retired as defense minister in 
1985 and as deputy premier in 1987 
the initial 50000run printing of the book was sold out less 
than two weeks after publication and extensive testimony before 
the parliamentary commission investigating bokors allegations was 
on front pages of many newspapers 
the affair has taken on an international dimension with 
criticism of the soviet union 
jenoe fock premier during some of czineges tenure as defense 
minister told the ninemember commission on feb 6 that the 
soviets felt they could work with czinege so he stayed even 
though the leadership was familiar with some of his shortcomings 
commission members have criticized not only czinege and his 
contemporaries but also the entire 42year communist era in hungary 
this investigation has made one thing very clear and that is 
that insignificant primitive politicians had run this country 
panel head ernoe raffay said on state radio 
bokor said the faults he exposed originated in the monolithic 
rule of communists in hungary and other soviet bloc countries 
in the final analysis these were created by the system and 
not only within the army he said ive heard it said that 
there is the need of many bokor books to expose corruption 
elsewhere in our society

the afghan defense minister trying to 
overthrow his government is a longtime marxist hardliner who 
opposes president najibs efforts to make peace with the 
usbacked moslem guerrillas 
both tanai and najib were key players in the 1978 coup that 
first brought the peoples democratic party of afghanistan to 
power but while najib in recent years has sought to distance 
himself and the party at least publicly from their communist 
roots tanai has a reputation as an unreconstructed militaristic 
marxist 
afghans who are both pro and antinajib and the party say tanai 
has been involved in three of five known coup attempts against 
najib since the former secret police chief became president in 
december 1986 
the fact that najib retained tanai in the cabinet and even 
promoted him to the partys 14member politburo illustrates the 
paradoxes inherent in the sovietbacked kabul government 
on the one hand najib has sought to placate some foes within 
the party by giving them positions of power on the other hand he 
has had to guard against attempted coups by them 
the afghan sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
tanai was linked to previous coup plots in july and december 1989 
governmentrun kabul radio identified tanai as the ringleader of 
tuesdays attempted coup and president najib demanded his capture 
dead or alive according to afghan exile monitors in new delhi 
radio kabul said tanai who was named defense minister by najib 
about 18 months ago plotted with fundamentalist guerrilla leader 
gulbaddin hekmatyar to try to topple najib 
such as alliance if true would be more one of convenience and 
opportunism than ideology for tanai has long been known to 
advocate a harsher stance against the mujahedeen guerrillas than 
najib himself 
by linking tanai to hekmatyar najibs government may be 
attempting to set the stage for tanais final and perhaps fatal 
disgrace in recent months najib has increasingly used hekmatyar 
as the personification of evil while maintaining there are other 
mujahedeen leaders who are more rational and welcome to join the 
government 
at the same time hekmatyar has become increasingly estranged 
from his fellow guerrilla leaders rejecting their political 
leadership and executing some of their followers 
tanai is one of the top leaders of khalq or masses faction 
of the ruling party najib is the leader of its parcham or 
flag faction 
although both factions include hardliners with commitments to 
communism parcham has become less doctrinaire and is less hawkish 
than khalq especially when it comes to making political overtures 
to the mujahedeen guerrillas or islamic holy warriors 
najib loyalists say the president has recently embarked on 
attempts to change the party and even its name in an effort to 
make it more palatable to the mujahedeen the afghan people and 
foreign opponents such as the us government 
to the mujahedeen such overtures are futile since these 
islamic fundamentalists refuse to deal with a party they consider 
nothing more than a bunch of godless communists 
tanai who is thought to be in his mid 40s has a reputation as 
an ultrahardliner especially when it comes to making any 
concessions to the mujahedeen or modifying the party which najib 
has sought to portray as a defender of islam and champion of a 
freemarket economy 
tanai like many afghans takes his surname from his ancestral 
homeland the tanai region near khost in southern afghanistan 
he became defense minister sometime in 1988 as often happens in 
afghanistan his appointment apparently was not formally announced 
but by late 1988 he was being referred to in kabul as the defense 
minister and when najib reshuffled his cabinet in february 1989 
after the soviet withdrawal tanai remained defense minister 
he was elevated to full membership from alternate membership in 
the party politburo in either late 1988 or in 1989 a promotion 
that can only take place with najibs concurrence

two giant business groups in japan and west germany 
have announced plans for wideranging cooperation in fields such as 
semiconductors and aeronautics officials said 
specifics of the accord between west germanys daimlerbenz and 
japans mitsubishi still must be ironed out but if it goes 
through the agreement could pose a competitive challenge for the 
united states analysts said today 
the agreement to expand ties was reached in secret meetings 
between the top exeuctives of the massive industrial groups in 
singapore last weekend mitsubishi officials announced tuesday 
mitsubishi said the industrial giants were discussing 
cooperation in highgrowth industries such as aerospace 
electronics and the service sector that would benefit from 
development on a global scale and make effective use of the skills 
of both groups the statement gave few other details 
the european market has become increasingly important for 
japanese companies and many are desperately seeking a firm 
foothold before the integration of the european community in 
1992 said atsushi takashima a corporate analyst with nomura 
research institute 
for benz mitsubishi is a giant company in japan and the 
cooperation with mitsubishi will help it achieve its plan to expand 
outside europe in regions such as asia takashima said 
but analysts said cooperation between the corporations in 
aerospace and semiconductors might worry us companies with which 
mitsubishi heavy industries has had close ties in jet and rocket 
production 
for the united states aerospace is the only field left in 
which it can be proud of its technology asahi shimbun newspaper 
said today 
some japanese newspapers speculated the agreement might worsen 
trade tension between japan and the united states but an analyst 
with sanwa research institute disagreed 
the arrangement between mitsubishi and daimler may be 
threatening to the united states but i dont think it will hurt 
ongoing trade talks he said 
he said on condition of anonymity that the accord was part of a 
global trend to establish joint projects among companies from 
japan europe and the united states such projects will only 
increase in coming years he said 
international business machines corp agreed in january with 
siemens ag of west germany to develop advanced computer memory 
chips he said 
mitsubishi heavy industries spokesman ryo suzuki tried to ease 
any us concern about the agreement today 
for us the most important partner has been the united states 
and it will remain the same if we start a joint project with 
daimler he said 
he said the partnership did not indicate company interest was 
shifting from america to europe 
mitsubishi said the companies excluded defense from areas of 
possible cooperation because japanese companies are prohibited by 
law from exporting weapons defense is one area where the private 
sector is unable to make its own decisions it is understood that 
it is the governments job suzuki said 
newspapers speculated the companies avoided cooperation in 
defense to avoid a repeat of their negative wartime images 
during world war ii both mitsubishi and daimler were active in 
arming the axis powers daimlerbenz engines were used extensively 
in german tanks fighters and bombers and mitsubishi helped 
produce japanese aircraft such as the zero fighter 
mitsubishi spokesman kyosuke mori said executives from both 
companies agreed to meet once a year and he said the next meeting 
was likely in 1991 
in 1988 mitsubishi motor and mercedesbenz established 
stuttgart auto service inc a jointventure company to sell and 
service mercedesbenz cars in japan said yoshimi mizuno a 
spokeswoman for mercedesbenz japan co last year 31511 
mercedesbenz were sold through the joint venture she said

a sharp rise in bad real estate and other 
domestic loans held consumer bank profits to a weak 27 billion in 
the final three months of last year the government said today 
for the year banks earned 163 billion a sharp 34 percent 
decline from last years record 248 billion profit said the 
federal deposit insurance corporation 
earnings reached record highs in the first two quarters of 1989 
of 73 billion and 70 billion but the industry went into the 
red in the julyseptember period losing 740 million because of 
third world debt problems 
1989 like march came in like a lion and went out like a 
lamb we had record earnings in the first half of the yearand 
we had a dramatic change in the second half said fdic chairman 
l william seidman 
loan losses industrywide soared to 92 billion in the fourth 
quarter a record since 1948 when that figure was first tracked 
in the northeast bad real estate loans more than doubled four 
northeastern states joined oilproducing states on the list of 10 
states with the worst real estate loan problems 
in order starting with the worst were arizona texas 
massachusetts connecticut alaska oklahoma louisiana new 
hampshire new york new mexico 
seidman predicted the industrys performance would improve this 
year at least in the first six months 
all is not on the black sideparticularly small community 
banks showed improved earnings he said much of the third 
world loan problems would appear to be behind most of the large 
banks 
in another positive sign the list of problem banks which 
the fdic uses to predict bank failures stood at 1093 at the end 
of 1989 down from 1394 a year earlier 
seidman forecast fewer bank failures in 1990 than the 206 
failures in 1989 he said the fdic insurance fund after a small 
loss in 1989 should break even or grow slightly in 1990

the removal of us chemical weapons 
from german soil will begin this summer and transporting the more 
than 100000 shells will pose no danger to the public us and 
west german officials said today 
defense minister gerhard stoltenberg detailed plans for a 
massive highsecurity transport of the nerve gas weapons which 
have been stored in this country for more than 20 years 
in may 1986 thenpresident reagan and chancellor helmut kohl 
agreed that all the artillery shells would be removed 
the presence of chemical weapons on german soil has long been 
criticized by west german environmentalists and peace activists 
they have alleged that in case of an accident involving chemical 
weapons us security concerns would take precedence over the 
protection of west germans 
us officials have strongly denied the claim 
speaking to reporters stoltenberg insisted the transport which 
is expected to take about three months would present no dangers to 
the environment or the public but he asked west germans to help 
make sure there are no attempts at disruption of the shipments 
stoltenberg did not specify what kinds of disruptions 
concerned him 
us army gen john heldstab deputy chief of staff for 
operations for the us armyeurope told reporters the army was 
confident that proper security would be provided for the 
transports 
stoltenberg said withdrawal of the artillery shells is scheduled 
to begin in july and last until september 
he said the shells now kept at a depot near clausen in the 
state of rhinelandpalatinate would be loaded into thick 
airtight steel magazines which would in turn be placed inside 
specially designed sheetmetal containers 
it was apparently the first official statement indicating where 
the chemical weapons are kept their location had previously been 
kept top secret for security reasons 
stoltenberg said the containers would be transported by truck to 
a us munitions depot in miesau 25 miles from clausen and loaded 
aboard railway cars the trains would transport the containers to 
the north sea port of nordenham where they will be loaded aboard 
specially equipped us transport ships stoltenberg said the 
munitions will then be shipped to the johnston atoll in the pacific 
for destruction 
he also said the strictest security conditions would be used 
for the transport of the artillery shells including special 
training for truck drivers moving the containers out of clausen 
col eckart fischer of the west german army said the artillery 
shells contain about 400 tons of the nerve gases vx and 
sarin 
fischer told reporters that more than 5000 containers will be 
needed to move the 155mm and 203mm artillery shells 
heldstab said the munitions represented about 1 percent of the 
united states total stockpile of chemical weapons

digest it said the dalai lama tibets spiritual and temporal 
leader and winner of the 1989 nobel peace prize 
he accused the chinese of trying to wipe out his people

have clashed with security forces at least 16 people died and 
hundreds were injured last year after three days of fighting and 
martial law was imposed march 7

executions have been carried out tibetans say 
china claims tibet has been part of china since the 13th 
century tibetan activists say their homeland was an independent 
country until chinese troops invaded in 1950 
for years the dalai lama demanded that china leave tibet and 
grant the huge mountainous territory complete independence but in 
june 1988 he offered to allow china the responsibility for tibets 
defense and foreign affairs in exchange for tibetan autonomy over 
internal affairs

ministers of the rightwing likud bloc and the 
leftofcenter labor party clashed today over us middle east 
peace proposals but a cabinet vote on the plan was postponed until 
the weekend 
also today a suspected palestinian collaborator was found 
hanged near his village in the occupied gaza strip arab reports 
said the army said it demolished the west bank home of a suspected 
uprising activist 
labor leaders said that if likud rejected the american proposals 
at sundays cabinet session they would ask labors central 
committee to vote the next day on leaving the government and 
forming a new coalition with small religious and leftwing parties 
economics minister moshe shahal a labor member told reporters 
after the session he doubted the ministers from prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs likud could accept the compromise proposals 
i dont think there is a possibility to get likud to change 
their minds shahal said i think that if the answer is 
negative from likud this government has no continuation 
todays cabinet debate focused on the composition of a 
palestinian delegation to preliminary peace talks with israel in 
cairo that would prepare the ground for elections in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
likud refuses to allow palestinians from israeliannexed arab 
east jerusalem to participate in the talks saying such 
representation would threaten israels claim of sovereignty over 
the disputed city 
some likud hardliners have also rejected the participation of 
palestinians who have been registered as residents of the occupied 
lands but have since been deported by israel 
the compromise proposed by us secretary of state james baker 
technically met israels requirement that the palestinian 
negotiators be residents of the occupied territories 
but in a nod toward the palestinians baker says the delegation 
should include at least one palestinian who has an office or a 
second home in jerusalem and one palestinian who was deported by 
israel 
in todays session labor ministers urged that the cabinet 
based on bakers proposal agree to consider on a namebyname 
basis any palestinian who is a resident of the territories 
shahal said explaining labors stand 
the two sides agreed before the session to postpone a vote until 
sunday apparently because two likud ministers were missing from 
the crucial meeting shahal said the 12member inner cabinet the 
governments key decisionmaking body consists of six ministers 
from labor and six from likud 
arab reports said the body of fahmi zaanin 23 was found 
hanging from a tree near the gaza village of beit hanoun where he 
was accused by fellow palestinians of collaboring with israeli 
authorities he was kidnapped from his home saturday by masked 
palestinians they said 
at least 659 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
or civilians in the 27monthold palestinian uprising 
an additional 193 palestinians have been slain by fellow arabs 
most on suspicion of collaborating with israel fortythree 
israelis have died 
also today soldiers blew up the home of mohammed karoush 45 
of the west bank village of deir balout arab reports said 14

brazils communist opposition for half a century died today of 
cancer doctors said he was 92 
prestes had suffered from leukemia said dr peylor meira 
administrator of the beneficiencia portuguesa hospital where 
prestes died 
in the 1980s prestes accused the brazilian communist party of 
abandoning marxistleninist dogma he was removed from the 
leadership in 1980 and expelled from the communist party in 1984 
he campaigned for centerleft candidate leonel brizola in 
brazils 1989 presidential election won by conservative fernando 
collor de mello 
in his final days nearly penniless prestes was largely 
supported by worldfamous brazilian architect oscar niemeyer a 
longtime communist sympathizer 
born jan 3 1898 in the southern city of porto alegre prestes 
moved with his family to rio de janeiro where he attended the 
prestigious realengo military academy 
in the 1920s prestes took part in unsuccessful military 
uprisings against president artur bernardes who was accused by 
critics of selling out national interests to england to pay the 
foreign debt 
in 1924 prestes an army captain led rebelling soldiers on a 
trek through brazils remote interior to preach revolution the 
legendary prestes column crossed 15000 miles and 13 states 
outmaneuvering and outfighting superior government forces he 
became a popular hero 
three years later the prestes column with just 65 men crossed 
the border into paraguay in exile in bolivia and argentina 
prestes became a marxist and moved to the soviet union 
in 1935 as head of the brazilian communist party prestes 
returned to brazil and led an unsucessful uprising against the 
government of president getulio vargas 
the movement gave vargas the excuse he needed to declare the 
estado novo dictatorship in 1937 and prestes was sentenced to 
46 years in prison 
after the dictatorship fell in 1945 prestes was given an 
amnesty and elected to the senate two years later the communist 
party was outlawed again and prestes was forced into hiding 
he led opposition to a 1964 rightwing military coup but in 
1971 he fled the country for the soviet union he returned with a 
new amnesty in 1979 
prestes body was to lie in state at the rio de janeiro state 
assembly and later to be buried at rios sao joao batista cemetery

early monday of the same cancer that killed three other members of 
the family she was 63

the former president and his wife rosalynn gathered at the 
lebanon cemetery on tuesday for a 30minute graveside service 
the mourners included men in business suits women in sunday 
dresses and bikers in grimy faded jackets with club colors 
emblazoned on the back 
walter spann his long hair tied in a pony tail wore a black 
leather jacket 
mrs spann belonged to the georgia motorcycle rights 
organization and was named most outstanding female motorcyclist in 
the nation in 1978 
the harleydavidson motorcycle co sent a floral spray 
riding sidebyside on 30 motorcycles the bikers led the 
funeral procession from americus to the cemetery a few miles 
southwest of plains in rolling farm country eight bikers served as 
pallbearers 
john the reverend herlihy a photographer and custom bike 
builder from melbourne fla was introduced to the mourners by the 
rev jenny jackson adams pastor of morningside united methodist 
church in americus 
the bearded middleaged biker with tattooed arms and long hair 
and wearing a black tshirt emblazoned with biker lifestyle 
stood at a microphone a few feet from the coffin his voice cracked 
with emotion as he remembered his discussions with mrs spann

shes in biker heaven herlihy said 
the pastor described mrs spann as a courageous person who lived 
life to the fullest and was an inspiration for others 
gloria was tough and gloria was wonderful she said 
gloria was a private person and saw no real need to explain her 
life to people she did not seek the spotlight but she was a light

was up against with this disease 
mrs spann had been diagnosed in december as having pancreatic 
cancer the same disease that killed her father james earl carter 
her sister ruth carter stapleton and her brother billy carter

perhaps it was part of her nature to transcend culture and to 
transcend lifestyles in the way that she did and to bring out the 
best in all kinds of people who thought of themselves as pretty 
rough characters adams said

jolted when he heard a radio playbyplay announcer say his 
patient a pro basketball player had collapsed during a game 
only after a long commercial break did kehoe learn to his 
relief that terry cummings of the san antonio spurs had simply 
sprained an ankle 
it has been about five years since kehoe helped cummings decide 
whether to continue his career despite an irregular heartbeat and 
the decision to go ahead appeared to be quite safe kehoe said 
but he added there probably isnt a day that goes by that i 
dont think about it 
his experience illustrates the difficult medical dilemma of 
whether an athletes career should continue despite risk from a 
lifethreatening disease a problem highlighted by the death on 
sunday of basketball star hank gathers 
a player with loyolamarymount university in los angeles 
gathers collapsed during a game and died he had been diagnosed as 
having an irregular heartbeat after fainting during a game in 
december ot conduct its 
affairs by coercion caperton said the deal is off 
federation leaders said they would meet with their county 
representatives today and decide whether to strike 
under the proposal raises for public school teachers and higher 
education employees would have been financed by a 1 per ton tax on 
coal the proposal also guaranteed full funding of the states 
health insurance program 
attorney general roger tompkins said state law does not permit a 
teacher walkout but federation executive director bob brown said 
this week a 1980 supreme court opinion gives public employees the 
right to strike 
the walkout could jeopardize todays start of the state high 
school basketball tournament an official said 
warren carter assistant director of the secondary schools 
activities commission which governs prep athletics said each 
county has individual rules concerning extracurricular activities 
when schools arent in session

the house of commons voted to renew for another 
year the prevention of terrorism act which allows police to detain 
terrorist suspects without charge for up to seven days without 
having to inform anyone 
the extension granted in a 227136 vote late tuesday also 
allows police to ban suspects from northern ireland from entering 
mainland britain 
the act was first passed in 1974 after the irish republican army 
bombed two pubs in the central england city of birmingham killing 
21 people 
it now is used to combat international terrorism in general but 
remains a prime weapon against the outlawed ira 
the mainly roman catholic ira fighting british rule in northern 
ireland wants to unite the predominantly protestant province with 
the 95 percent catholic republic of ireland under socialist rule 
home secretary david waddington the member of prime minister 
margaret thatchers conservative cabinet responsible for police 
told the commons 
during 1989 the nation witnessed not only 62 further killings 
in northern ireland but also the terrible incident at deal in 
which 11 soldiers were brutally murdered and the callous shooting 
of a royal air force corporal and his baby daughter in west germany 
as time goes on we are more not less resolved to defeat 
terrorism 
waddington said without the act the work of security forces in 
countering terrorism would have been more difficult and less 
effective he said the casualty toll also would have been higher 
an ira bomb at an army school of music at deal in southeast 
england in september killed 11 people who play in military bands 
two ira gunmen killed an raf corporal and his 6monthold 
daughter in october near a british air base at wildenrath in west 
germany

county supervisors defied a judges order and 
refused to schedule a june election on making malibu a city they 
instructed county attorneys to challenge the judges jurisdiction 
over the issue 
backers of cityhood for the starstudded seaside enclave said 
their lawyers would ask superior court judge dzintra janavs to cite 
the supervisors for contempt 
what we are seeing is an unmitigated outrage walt keller 
cochairman of the malibu committee for incorporation said of the 
countys move tuesday 
ms janavs last week ordered supervisors to comply with an order 
she issued in january to set an election date no later than march 
9 the deadline to include the cityhood vote on the june 5 ballot 
the board of supervisors has opposed incorporation insisting 
that a sewer system be installed before cityhood is established 
they contend that once elected a new malibu government would try 
to block the planned system 
many cityhood supporters regard the countys insistence on a new 
sewer system as a prelude to widespread development they filed a 
lawsuit against the supervisors accusing the county of violating a 
state law that sets a 60day limit on the duration of a hearing 
before an election date is set

children in the 72 poorest nations 
could gain access to a basic education by 2000 if 5 billion a year 
is spent on the task a senior united nations official said today 
the annual cost by the mid1990s is roughly equivalent to the 
amount the world now devotes to military expenditure every two 
days or to the total of the usas annual expenditure on cigarette 
advertising and the amount the soviet union spends a year on 
vodka said james p grant 
grant director of the un childrens fund did not say what 
current education spending is he as addressing the third day of 
the 155nation world conference on education for all un 
officials sponsoring the conference have said almost 1 billion 
adults are illiterate and more than 100 million children have 
never seen the inside of a classroom 
a un official who requested anonymity said the world bank 
and other agencies and countries have pledged half of the extra 5 
billion needed annually he said the conference sponsors hoped to 
persuade donor countries to make up the rest 
at tuesdays conference session the world bank announced it 
will substantially increase its loans for international education 
to an annual level of 15 billion by 1993 the un childrens 
fund said it would increase education funding to 200 million 
annually by the end of the century 
grant said latin america and subsaharan africa had the worst 
problems educating children and the newly industrialized countries 
of east asia were the success stories 
some conference delegates said that even with new loans poor 
nations cant improve their education programs unless the bank and 
other lending institutions abandon current repayment conditions for 
largescale debt 
world bank president barber conable told reporters today that 
poor nations can devote more resources to education by changing 
spending priorities and eliminating waste including excessive 
military budgets 
should we forgive debt built up for military purposes he 
asked

libya today denied us reports that a plant outside 
tripoli is producing chemical weapons and said the allegations were 
aimed at creating suspicion surrounding moves by arabafrican 
nations toward unity 
in washington the white house said today the libyan plant at 
rabta 60 miles south of the libyan capital was dangerous and 
urged vigorous efforts to stop its operation white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said evidence suggests the plant is 
dangerous and becoming more so 
late tuesday us officials said the plant was turning out 
mustard gas and nerve agents the officials speaking on condition 
of anonymity did not disclose the quantity of chemicals allegedly 
produced 
abc television news in a report broadcast late tuesday said 
the plant had been producing mustard gas and assembling 
handpacked small bombs that could carry the chemical weapons to 
targets 
jana the libyan news agency in a dispatch monitored in rome 
said an unidentified official source at the libyan foreign 
ministry today disclaimed the abc report that libya has 
produced quantities of chemical weapons in the rabta medicine 
factory 
the source according to jana said such allegations aired at 
present by some media circles aim at creating a state of 
suspicion surrounding arabafrican nations efforts toward 
economic and political unity 
the arab magreb union formed in february 1989 groups libya 
algeria tunisia morocco and mauritania and aims to set up an 
economic common market on the european model 
since western reports surfaced in 1988 that the factory was 
gearing up to produce chemical weapons col moammar gadhafis 
regime has insisted the plants purpose is to produce 
pharmaceuticals 
western journalists were invited to tour the plant in january 
last year but were not allowed to inspect the facility after they 
arrived in rabta 
the west german government has investigated allegations a west 
german firm helped build the plant the investigation has not yet 
been concluded us officials have urged foreign companies not to 
help develop or supply the plant 
the jana dispatch today said the foreign ministry source 
expressed sorrow over the sham reports especially in light of 
libyas call for balanced and open dialogue with the new us 
administration 
former president ronald reagan ordered the bombing of tripoli 
and another libyan city benghazi in april 1986 in retaliation for 
what he called libyas support of international terrorism

mile for mile vehbi gunduz is probably the 
worst cab driver in town he insults bullies and threatens 
passengers dispatchers and inspectors 
he overcharges riders denies them receipts and refuses to take 
them where they want to go his cab is filthy his trunk a mess 
his hack license as hard to find as a taxi on a rainy night 
but his ride on the wild side may be over 
on thursday the taxi and limousine commission plans to ask a 
judge to revoke license no 411689 
although the ranks of the citys 34000 taxi drivers contain 
many candidates for the unofficial title of new yorks worst 
cabbie gunduzs resume is five pages long in recent years he has 
been convicted of or admitted to 119 rules violations 
hes in a pickle said attorney michael stone who has 
represented gunduz the best stone can say about gunduzs record 
he never has attacked a member of the public 
gunduz has dodged expulsion from the industry by never going too 
far hes the kind of driver who according to commission staffer 
bruce schaller consistently does a lot of fairly bad or pretty 
bad things but nothing really outrageous that would lead to 
license revocation 
gunduz who is in his late 30s recently moved from his long 
island home and had his telephone disconnected he could not be 
reached for comment on the case against him 
last year he was one of eight hack rats whose faces 
appeared in the daily news gunduz who was serving a twomonth 
suspension blamed most of his troubles on airport dispatchers 
trying to shake him down for money 
i am getting tired of this job he said im going to give 
up im working and working and im paying all the money for the 
summonses 
but a few months later a taxi inspector at kennedy 
international said he saw gunduz charging an asian passenger 15 
for a ride between the twa and united terminals 
the meter was off and the inspector found that a seal that 
prevents tampering had been broken when the inspector tried to 
remove the cabs medallion gunduz physically poked and pushed 
me the inspector reported 
three months later according to commission records gunduz 
picked up a couple outside iberias terminal they had only one 
piece of luggage which was fortunate because his trunk was so 
cluttered it had room for no more rule violation no 1 
the couple said they wanted to go to another terminal gunduz 
who does not like short fares said no violation no 2 the 
dispatcher told him to get going because cabbies must take 
passengers to any destination in the city 
gunduz drove off from the stand but about 1000 feet away he 
stopped announced that his meter did not work and told his 
passengers to get out 
when they refused he stepped out yanked their suitcase from 
the trunk and dumped it in the road when the couple got out to 
retrieve it he jumped back in and sped off violation no 3 
inside the cab there had been no sign of the drivers photo 
name or license number violation no 4 but the man scribbled 
down the plate number and gunduz eventually was given a ticket in 
absentia for 400 
meanwhile the commission was hatching a plan to rid the roads 
of chronically bad cabbies who by some estimates are responsible 
for 10 percent of rider complaints 
the commission searched its files and fashioned a mostwanted 
list of nine cabbies the plan was to wait for any of them to 
commit an infraction and use it to seek license revocations based 
on the entire driving record rather than one or several egregious 
incidents 
all the commission needed was one new violation no matter how 
small to get a driver before a judge 
the commission did not have to wait long the rules took effect 
oct 15 three days later gunduz allegedly threatened a dispatcher 
at kennedy 
when the summons popped up in the commission computer agency 
lawyers went to work a judge will hear gunduzs case this week and 
tell the commissioners within a few weeks whether gunduz should be 
thrown off the road 
whatever the fate of his license gunduz is a dinosaur under 
the new rules no new york cabbie will ever again be allowed to be 
so bad for so long thanks to an automatic point system for 
violators well get them off the road before they can accumulate 
a record like his promised schaller

the bush administration said today it was 
encouraged by the latest comments from iranian president hashemi 
rafsanjani saying a solution is near to the plight of the western 
hostages in lebanon 
were encouraged by the comments they certainly are more 
hopeful than what weve heard in the more distant past said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
irans official islamic republic news agency today quoted 
rafsanjani as saying my feeling is that the issue of the 
hostages is moving toward a solution 
rafsanjani repeated irans demands that western nations help 
trace iranian hostages missing in lebanon and also reduce their 
mischievous acts the news agency reported 
fitzwater said the remarks are in line with statements that we 
have seen in recent days and weeks that there was some interest in 
iran in better relations with the west we hope that thats the 
case and that it will result in release of the hostages 
the white house spokesman added but we have no direct 
knowledge that that is going to happen and we have no direct 
knowledge of mr rafsanjanis motives or purposes in making those 
remarks 
secretary of state james a baker iii registered his hope 
tuesday that the hostages would be released 
we see what is coming across here and we are encouraged by the 
fact there is speculation he told reporters lets see if that 
speculation proves out we would like to see anybody that could 
influence it in that regard weigh in 
while the bush administration is not suggesting release is 
imminent officials are confirming reports of a flurry of 
behindthescenes talks by officials outside the government 
weve been talking for a long time to anyone who could have 
influence algerians syrians a us official told the 
associated press we talk to the iranians through a lot of 
people we have talked to enough people that the message has gotten 
through to the iranians 
the message said the official who demanded anonymity is we 
know you want access to the west youve said you are against 
terrorism we want to see action 
even with all the activity the official acknowledged we 
dont have anything to correlate all this together and say this is 
moving 
meanwhile a tehran newspaper close to rafsanjani said 1990 
would be the last year for captivity for the hostages and that a 
resumption of ties to the united states was not a condition for 
their release 
in an editorial the englishlanguage tehran times said syrian 
president hafez assad would visit tehran soon after an expected 
trip by his foreign minister farouk alsharaa 
syria is both the dominant military force in lebanon and the 
closest arab country to iran that also maintains us ties 
officially the state department had no explanation for the 
flurry of rumors 
there are no us government talks spokeswoman margaret d 
tutwiler said our policy has not changed since yesterday there 
is nothing new today and i dont know why all those rumors sprung 
up 
but baker intercepted by reporters in the diplomatic entrance 
as he ushered italian prime minister giulio andreotti to his 
limousine did not choose to spike the rumors 
another senior us official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity suggested that a political struggle in iran might 
explain some of the positive westwardleaning statements from 
tehran 
iran is believed to exert considerable influence over hezbollah 
the umbrella group for radical shiite moslems holding some if not 
all of the eight american hostages 
the eight americans are among 18 westerners believed to be held 
captive in lebanon terry a anderson who was middle east bureau 
chief of the associated press has been held the longest since 
march 16 1985 
in beirut the respected annahar daily ruled out any hostage 
release soon but quoted unidentified lebanese fundamentalist 
sources as saying iran was prepared to tackle the hostage issue 
the sources were quoted as saying there had been no direct 
contacts between iran and the united states but both were looking 
for a mechanism for releasing the hostages the report did not 
elaborate

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the country 
march 5 
austin texas americanstatesman on crime 
a dramatic report out of washington has evidence that nearly one 
in four black men nationwide is in the hands of the criminal 
justice system at some level a much higher rate than that of white 
or hispanic males although the report advocates alternatives to 
prison which could include needed social services what should be 
emphasized is alternatives to crime 
in far too many innercity neighborhoods crime is becoming the 
legacy that parents leave their children in far too many 
communities the only skills passed down to the new generation are 
survival skills often survival at any cost for young men trapped 
in poverty and living in a society where chances for success are 
constantly shrinking selling drugs and robbing people is 
considered by some the best means of support 
the innercity unemployment rate approaches 4050 percent in 
many communities 
a few months back the national urban league advocated that the 
socalled peace dividend be used to overcome such social problems 
while use of that illusory fund in itself was somewhat unrealistic 
the problem does demand attention 
for those who are willing and able to work job training that is 
compatible with the job market must be offered and the resulting 
jobs must be more than minimumwage deadend jobs 
but the best and most longterm solution would be to create an 
environment in which fewer people are introduced to the criminal 
justice system

the athens ohio messenger on asbestos 
in a new and persuasive report in the magazine science a group 
of american and french researchers make it clearer than ever that 
when it comes to asbestos in schools and other public buildings 
the cure can often be worse than the disease 
they point out among other things that in schools where 
asbestoscontaining material is not damaged the danger of 
asbestosrelated disease is several thousand times lower than the 
danger from aircraft accidents high school football drowning 
home accidents or longterm smoking 
they also say that while one type of asbestos is frequently 
associated with lung disease in miners and asbestos workers the 
type most commonly used in the united states sheds a fiber of a 
different shape thats more easily repelled by the lungs 
prevention of tobacco smoking the prinicipal cause of lung 
cancer they conclude is both a more promising and rational 
approach to eliminating lung tumors than asbestos abatement

the arizona daily star tucson ariz on foreign searches 
the supreme court gave an unsatisfactory answer to an 
indirect question about what kind of country this is the court 
said the fourth amendment doesnt protect foreigners from 
warrantless searches by us officials on foreign soil 
and you thought this was a place where justice is an 
allinclusive philosophy apparently not this country will split 
semantic hairs to justify actions that go against the grain of the 
fourth amendments assertion that people should be secure in their 
persons houses papers and effects 
the decision may make is easier in the future or in the case 
of evidence seized during the american invasion of panama to 
prosecute drug smugglers and other unsavory characters it will 
make a handy tool in the war on drugs drug trafficking knows no 
borders and honors no highsounding ideals about human rights 
but the constitition was not written to make law enforcement 
easier it was not designed to facilitate the war on drugs it was 
not meant to be read with an eye to convenience 
it was designed to reflect the kind of country this is and what 
it believes to be the proper relationship between government and 
people to narrow those sentiments makes americas muchtouted 
devotion to human rights look a little less than sincere 
the decision invites the kind of behavior the united states 
should discourage

duluth minn newstribune on foreign searches 
what kind of message does the united states send to the rest of 
the world when we allow agents of our government to do things in 
other countries that wouldnt be allowed here a bad one 
what kind of example of freedom is it when we dont practice 
elsewhere what we preach in our own constitution a hypocritical 
one 
the us supreme court ruled the fourth amendments 
provisions barring unreasonable search and seizure do not apply to 
property located abroad and owned by foreign suspects thats not 
surprising no one expects the us constitution to apply in other 
parts of the world 
what americans should expect is that its principles would be 
observed by representatives of our government operation abroad the 
constitution is the document after all that is held up as the 
shining example of freedom that should be emulated 
the issue was brought before the high court in a dispute over 
the us drug enforcement administration operations in mexico in 
which houses owned by a mexican drug smuggler were searched by us 
agents without a warrant the ruling is expected to strengthen the 
hand of us law enforcement officials in the war on drugs 
no one except drug dealers would want to impede those efforts 
but we question a government policy that would order american 
agents to function in foreign countries by a different set of 
standards than those we observe at home

the reporter fond du lac wis on credit card frauds 
the story out of milwaukee the other day about credit fraud via 
card numbers retrieved from merchants trash holds a message for 
users of credit at both ends of the system 
the milwaukee gang and others around the country pulled 
carbons from merchants trash containers not only for credit 
cards but longdistance access codes and accounts with shipping 
companies as well they used the numbers for purchases and the card 
owners got the bills 
consumers tend to treat credit cards casually in truth they 
represent a great deal of money even though laws protect consumers 
from heavy losses when card numbers are used by thieves there 
still is a potential for some loss unless safeguards are taken 
the simplest is to not leave behind the carbon copy of a credit 
transaction some carbons are automatically split but even that is 
not totally safe 
credit customers should be sure to retrieve their own carbons 
after credit purchases and store clerks should be instructed to 
offer to return the carbon

the registerguard eugene ore on smoking 
there is good news and bad news on the smoking front 
the good news is that smoking has been banned on all 
domestic airline flights of less than six hours that means 
smokefree airplanes on all flights within the contiguous 48 states 
and on 998 percent of all domestic flights the only exceptions 
are flights of six hours or longer to alaska or hawaii 
in time given the steady march toward more smokefree 
environments it can be hoped that all domestic flights will be 
smokeless 
there is also good news in the fact that the percentage of 
american adults who smoke fell to 29 percent in 1987 from 40 
percent in 1965 
the bad news is that smoking costs the nation 52 billion a year 
in health costs and lost productivity 
thats 12 billion more than the cigarette companies generate in 
sales each year thats 390000 americans dying from 
smokingrelated causes each year more than the yearly deaths from

the philadelphia inquirer on jimmy carters role in nicaragua 
for too long and unfairly to boot he was the rodney 
dangerfield of former presidents but jimmy carter has been 
redeeming himself with good works capping a stellar comeback 
with a truly magnificent performance in nicaraguas lowflashpoint 
elections 
the sofar peaceful sandinista concession could still fly apart 
of course but without carters energetic personal efforts it 
might not ever have gotten this far 
he was always a detail man and as he bounced down dusty 
nicaraguan roads in his role as an observer he paid close 
attention to the elections finer points on each visit he nailed 
down another agreement safeguarding the return of exiled 
nicaraguan indians condemning campaign violence unfreezing 
stalled us funds intended for opposition parties 
but carter has not been without a vision too of the 
potential for peace in what appear to be otherwise intractable 
conflicts he has proved that recently as a globetrotting mediator 
a diploevangelist one reporter called him brokering 
disputes from ethiopia to panama in fact his verdict of fraud in 
panamas vote last may was widely regarded as the last straw for 
gen manuel noriega stripping him of any pretense of legitimacy 
in nicaragua carter apparently went one better beyond 
legitimizing the outcome he provided some evidently muchneeded 
counseling to a stunned daniel ortega as perhaps only one defeated 
national leader can give to another while urging victorious 
violeta chamorro to adopt a sober conciliatory public demeanor 
coming only a week after former president ronald reagan was 
demonstrating his shaky grasp of nicaraguan affairs in taped 
testimony on the irancontra imbroglio the carter mission was a 
reminder that a steady handson approach isnt the worst way to 
deal with tough conflicts

las vegas reviewjournal on the nicaraguan election 
the american left including those residents of west hollywood 
berkeley santa monica and cambridge mass who traipsed off to 
communist nicaragua to plant coffee teach english and propagandize 
for the sandinistas is crestfallen 
the people of nicaragua have spoken and american leftists hated 
what they said 
with the demise of the sandinistas and their marxistleninist 
experiment in which the nicaraguan people were used as guinea 
pigs whats a poor prosandinista american leftist supposed to do 
now 
perhaps they shall shift their resources toward helping the 
cubanbacked guerrillas in el salvador impose a communist 
dictatorship on that unfortunate nation 
or perhaps they can work toward preventing fidel castros 
bankrupt dictatorship from biting the dust in cuba 
one of these days american marxists who idolize the likes of 
ortega and castro are going to have to face up to the fact that 
they are no longer progressive instead they truly must be 
called reactionaries now in a world in which people from east 
germany to nicaragua are sweeping out the deadwood of communism

spill before it blackened 1100 miles of shoreline has been 
frustrated again in its efforts to contain the spills damages 
this time it was not oil but criminal damages that exxon was 
attempting to confine 
just a week ago it looked as if the company would succeed in a 
tentative plea agreement that outraged alaskans the justice 
department declared itself ready to limit exxons criminal 
liabilities for the spill to 500 million civil suits by the

government is sending a strong signal that environmental crimes 
will not be tolerated

the north jersey herald and news passaic nj on andy rooney 
cbs also known as the cynical broadcast company has put andy 
rooney back on the air after the commentator served three weeks of 
a threemonth suspension 
rooney was booted off the airwaves for racial remarks attributed 
to him by a gay magazine rooney denied making the remarks 
the suspension created a wave of protest from freespeech 
advocates and from viewers during rooneys suspension the ratings 
for 60 minutes the program on which he rambles about whatever 
comes to mind dropped 
so now cbs is putting him back on not because the network 
became a believer in free speech but because his return will 
certainly boost ratings 
did you ever wonder if rooney would have been reinstated early 
if the ratings for 60 minutes had soared while he was gone 
just a rhetorical question

victorville calif daily press on sen alan cranston 
sen alan cranston the sierra clubs creature keeps making 
noises about how hes not only not going to resign but plans on 
seeking yet another sixyear term were he reelected which he 
wont be he would have been a member of the senate for nearly a 
quarter of a century 
cranston of course is but the latest example of why wed all 
be better off if united states senators were limited to a maximum 
of two terms and congressmen to a maximum of six thus limiting 
the membership in both chambers to a maximum of 12 years of 
public service even 12 years in some cases cranston again 
comes to mind is too long 
he sees nothing sinister for instance about his role in the 
savings and loan debacle and his acceptance of 850000 in 
contributions from the lincoln savings amp loan pipeline 
worst of all well perhaps not worst but right in there 
cranston finds the idea of returning the 850000 not only 
abhorrent but downright silly how sad 
the sierra club despite its avowed purpose of conserving all 
creatures great and small wont be able to keep this one around 
much longer his continued presence would only harm and perhaps 
ultimately destroy some of the clubs pet projects chief among 
them the passage of the desert preservation bill 
cranston has become damaged goods and will soon be dumped its 
too bad in a way wed started to develop a certain affection for 
the old fraud

the united states should support reform 
efforts in the soviet union through moves such as liberalized 
trade credit guarantees and continued grain sales secretary of 
state james a baker iii said today 
but baker testifying before a house appropriations 
subcommittee said there is no need for direct financial aid to 
moscow and they havent asked for it 
rather baker said the united states should share its business 
and economic expertise lift restrictions on credit and credit 
guarantees and enhance discussions aimed at concluding a new 
longterm grain sales agreement 
we ought to support the reform efforts in the soviet union 
baker said asked whether communism has ceased to be a threat to 
the united states he added we ought not to gloat too much over 
our success it is not overlyproductive to stick a stick in 
their eye just for the hell of it 
the secretarys comments came a day after the no 2 house 
democratic leader rep richard gephardt proposed offering not 
only trade and investment incentives for the soviets but also 
direct food aid as ways of keeping president mikhail gorbachevs 
reform campaign alive 
gephardts proposal brought reactions from colleagues ranging 
from wary approval to outright condemnation 
we shouldnt be writing out checks to gorbachev while hes 
propping up castro in cuba and other communist regimes and 
insurgencies around the world said senate minority leader bob 
dole rkan 
dole said it is time for the united states to aid eastern 
european countries emerging from decades of soviet domination but 
that direct aid to moscow of the sort proposed tuesday by gephardt 
the house majority leader would at best be premature 
we ought to exact a fair price for those benefits including 
a cessation of support for cuba syria afghanistan and angola 
dole said 
it was dole who led the way five years ago in making the soviets 
eligible for us subsidies to buy grain a move that helped kansas 
wheat farmers since then moscow has bought more than 730 million 
bushels of us wheat at a subsidy value in the hundreds of 
millions of dollars 
sen bill bradley dnj noted that the soviets havent 
requested us help and that if they did it would be wasted 
without economic reform unless they reform the economy its 
going down a rathole bradley said 
others on capitol hill said that while they thought gephardts 
proposal would spark a useful debate the idea would fall on 
disapproving public ears 
if youre going to start giving foreign aid to the hated 
commies youve got a real sales job to do in the united 
states said sen alan simpson rwyo 
gephardt said when he offered the idea in a speech that he knew 
there would be political risks involved and that americans might 
react negatively 
but he told reporters when i was in europe two months ago i 
was embarrassed that we are not being as strong and as courageous 
as they are weathering dramatic price increases and other 
dislocations in the name of economic reform cant we do 
something to help he asked 
specifically the missouri democrat called for food aid to the 
soviet union along with mostfavorednation trading status and us 
risk insurance to businesses that want to invest in soviet ventures 
house speaker thomas foley dwash backed the gephardt 
proposal and said attitudes in congress are changing along with the 
rapidly moving events in the crumbling east bloc 
it is a dramatically different circumstance than it was only a 
few months ago foley said citing multiparty elections in the 
soviet union 
we should recognize these changes that are coming on very 
fast and that we have a stake in this country in supporting those 
changes that are moving toward private economic activity and 
democracy

secessionist rebels in ethiopias 
northernmost province of eritrea are rejecting economic and 
political reforms proposed by president mengistu haile mariam 
the eritrean peoples liberation front said ethiopias economy 
has been shattered by the governments war against it and other 
rebel groups and the only solution is to end the conflict 
in a clandestine radio broadcast monitored in nairobi on tuesday 
night the rebel group called again for a plebiscite in eritrea to 
determine the provinces independence or unity 
it said mengistu was opposing this choice which can genuinely 
solve the ethiopian problem promptly 
mengistu on monday proposed scrapping the rigid marxist 
economic system ethiopia has followed for 15 years and replacing it 
with a mixed economy with free markets 
he also proposed that the name of the ruling marxistleninist 
workers party be changed to the ethiopian democratic unity party 
and that it seek a broader more representative base 
in a speech to the partys central committee mengistu invited 
opposition groups to participate but he stopped short of proposing 
a multiparty system or diminishing the ruling partys monopoly on 
power 
in short the rebel radio broadcast said there is nothing 
which can be changed except the name of the party what is very 
surprising is that col mengistu even now believes that he will be 
able to deceive the people through such a kind of open mischief 
the eritrean rebels have been fighting for independence for 28 
years last month they opened a new offensive and claimed to 
capture ethiopias only deepwater port of massawa on the red sea 
the government has not acknowledged that claim but admits the 
port has been closed by fighting that it says continues in and 
around the city 
the government also faces a threat from a smaller rebel force 
the tigre peoples liberation front it has been fighting for 14 
years to overthrow mengistu and replace his regime with one 
patterned after that of albania the last hardline marxist state 
in eastern europe

universities found to be weak in ideological or 
political studies will have their enrollments cut and may be shut 
down chinas leading daily said wednesday 
the official peoples daily said the state education commission 
also decided to reduce enrollments of universities with graduates 
in majors in less demand when job assignments are made most likely 
to be affected are programs in the liberal arts 
the commission meeting in the southern city of changsha worked 
out an enrollment plan for 620000 new undergraduates and 
vocational students for the school year starting in the fall 
in 1989 colleges and universities enrolled 597000 freshmen a 
sharp drop of 108 percent from 1988 as the government moved to 
purify campuses of bourgeois liberal tendencies 
many universities where students actively participated in the 
apriljune prodemocracy movement had their freshman classes cut 
beijing university chinas most prestigious campus and a center 
of the democracy campaign crushed by military force on june 34 
had its freshman enrollment slashed from 2100 to 800 with all 
firstyear students sent out of beijing for a year at a military 
school 
ideological studies emphasizing loyalty to the communist party 
were expanded and made compulsory and workstudy programs designed 
to make students more in touch with the masses were increased 
the education commission said enrollments will be cut or 
suspended in 1990 for schools weak in political and ideological 
work and where courses are not clearly linked to future jobs 
it said experiments in allowing a few students to pay their own 
way would continue but that selffinanced students would be 
restricted to less than 3 percent of the total 
the government previously promoted the idea of accepting more 
students who pay their own tuition as a means of raising funds for 
the woefully underfinanced education system selfpaid students 
were accepted with lower test scores and given greater freedom to 
choose their own jobs after graduation 
the drive to ensure the ideological loyalty of students 
however appears to have made financially independent students 
suspect normally almost all tuition and boarding costs are 
subsidized by the government 
the peoples daily in a separate article reported a public 
security ministry crackdown on students who pay large sums to 
obtain admission documents from foreign schools 
it said the ministry which must approve all passports wont 
recognize illegally bought admission notices or economic guarantee 
documents and that anyone caught practicing fraud or illegally 
dealing in foreign exchange will have their passports seized 
a small number of foreign organizations and individuals have 
cheated chinese and made large profits by selling admissions to 
foreign schools it said 
the government has already moved to discourage the many students 
wanting to study in the west by making it more difficult to obtain 
transcripts and take englishlanguage proficiency tests and 
requiring applicants to have up to five years work experience 
before going abroad

police today fired on 
thousands of protesters who attacked and burned government 
buildings in the black homeland of bophuthatswana seven people 
were reported killed and up to 500 injured 
the clash began after up to 50000 protesters in the nominally 
independent homeland the second to erupt in violence in four days 
attempted to stage a march to demand its reintegration into south 
africa and the resignation of the territorys president 
police using rifles and tear gas guns opened fire after 
protesters set fire to public buildings and vehicles in garankuwa 
in the homeland north of johannesburg local officials said 
homeland president lucas mangope tonight declared a state of 
emergency in several parts of bophuthatswana which has about 2 
million residents scattered over seven separate pieces of land 
the star newspaper of johannesburg quoting witnesses and 
doctors said at least seven people were killed by gunfire and that 
up to 500 people suffered various injuries the independent south 
african press association said the sound of gunfire and fighting 
was heard in several areas 
the new violence erupted as south african troops restored order 
in the ciskei homeland on the southeastern coast after rioting in 
the wake of a military coup south african officials said ciskei 
was calm and no unrest was reported today in that territory 
the ciskei military government seized power sunday in a 
bloodless coup and allying itself with the antiapartheid african 
national congress declared itself in favor of reintegration into 
south africa 
antiapartheid activists contend the homelands were established 
in an attempt by the white minority government to restrict blacks 
to the most isolated and underdeveloped parts of the country and 
deny them citizenship about half of south africas 28 million 
blacks live in the 10 homelands whose sovereignty is not 
recognized abroad 
the bophuthatswana army staged a coup in 1988 but south african 
sent in troops and blocked the overthrow of the government in the 
past month unrest has cost six lives and injured dozens of people 
in the homeland protesters today called for the resignation of 
mangope who has rejected calls to return the territory to south 
africa 
all government offices and many businesses shops and schools in 
the area were closed and protesters hijacked buses to take them to 
the march officials said many people stayed away from work or 
school to support the protests 
in ciskei after widespread rioting and looting broke out the 
new junta declared a state of emergency on and asked for assistance 
from south african troops at least 27 people were killed and 550 
injured in the unrest 
brig gen oupa gqozo who heads the junta said ousted 
president lennox sebe would be arrested if he attempted to return 
sebe was on a trade mission in hong kong when the military struck 
ciskei industrialists said looting and arson that followed the 
coup had shattered the economy and destroyed up to 10000 jobs ray 
brentnall head of the ciskei chamber of industries said rioting 
caused damage worth millions of dollars but did not give any 
overall figure 
people are very upset after sweating blood to build up their 
businesses its heartbreaking to see them go up in flames he 
said 
the coup in ciskei was hailed by most people who detested the 
authoritarian seke regime but the celebrations that followed 
turned to riots and looting with mobs attacking and burning shops 
factories and businesses 
dozens of foreignowned factories were burned because they were 
identified with the old government which attracted foreign 
investment by providing labor at wages of 50 a month or less 
gqozo told the state south african broadcasting corp that his 
government had begun to release political prisoners held by sebe 
gqozo also said the new government would investigate charges of 
corruption against the ousted president 
human rights groups said sebes government had detained hundreds 
of dissidents 
south africas proapartheid conservative party criticized the 
south african government for not intervening sooner in ciskei to 
prevent the chaos 
these little stonethrowing looting arsonist criminals are 
probably a precursor to the new south africa said tom langley a 
member of parliament for the conservatives 
since taking office in august president fw de klerk has made 
a series of concessions to blacks in a bid to bring black leaders 
into talks on dismantling apartheid and sharing power 
south africa established the homelands in an attempt to create 
separate tribalbased states for blacks while whites would retain 
control of national politics and the economy

american workers productivity in the nonfarm 
portion of the nations economy last year posted its worst 
performance since 1982 improving only 09 percent the government 
said wednesday 
meanwhile hourly labor costs a major inflation measure for 
businesses escalated significantly jumping by 54 percent the 
labor department said that increase up from 47 percent in 1988 
was the biggest rise in hourly labor costs since the 198182 
recession 
thats what happens when you have a slowdown in the economy 
you get squeezed from both ends the two blades of the scissors 
subdued productivity and higher labor costs began to push 
together said robert dederick chief economist for the northern 
trust co of chicago 
there is no real evidence that productivity is going to 
escalate any time soon were not likely to break out of this vice 
in 1990 dederick said 
the 09 percent productivity gain for the year was the same 
improvement reported in preliminary figures provided last month as 
was the 02 percent productivity gain reported for the 
octoberdecember period 
the labor department said the 09 percent increase in 
productivity defined as output per hour of work was less than 
half the 2 percent gain recorded in 1988 
the fourth quarters productivity gain of 02 percent was well 
below the 24 percent gain of the previous quarter 
since the end of the 198182 recession productivity growth has 
averaged 18 percent a year while a slight improvement over the 
12 percent average growth in the 1970s it was still far below the 
33 percent rate of increase posted in the two decades after world 
war ii when american workers enjoyed healthy wage gains and a 
rising standard of living 
increasing productivity is considered basic to boosting living 
standards because it allows businesses to pay workers more as their 
output rises without risking higher inflation 
in addition to the large increase in hourly compensation the 
report showed that unit labor costs another key determinant of 
future price inflation shot up 45 percent for the year compared 
with a 27 percent increase in 1988 unit labor costs reflect 
changes in compensation as well as changes in productivity 
hourly labor costs for the fourth quarter increased by 6 
percent the department said 
output in the nonfarm portion was up 33 percent in 1989 while 
the number of hours worked rose by 24 percent giving the 09 
percent increase in productivity 
for the fourth quarter output was unchanged and the number of 
hours worked fell by 02 percent the first drop since 1986 
in the manufacturing sector productivity grew by 28 percent 
for both the year and the quarter during the octoberdecember 
period productivity in the manufacturing of nondurable goods 
increased by 83 percent to outweigh the 04 percent productivity 
decline in durable goods the report said

a renegade afghan general who tried 
to overthrow the government of afghanistan fled with his family to 
pakistan today pakistani and guerrilla sources said giving weight 
to government claims the coup attempt had been crushed 
gen shah nawaz tanai the battlehardened defense minister 
linked to three coup attempts against the sovietbacked government 
in kabul flew aboard an afghan military helicopter with his wife 
two daughters and a son to the frontier town of peshawar said the 
sources who demanded anonymity 
according to guerrilla sources tanai left bagram air base at 2 
pm earlier reports said mutineers had seized control of bagram 
afghanistans largest air base the afghan government had denied 
those reports and the situation remained unclear late today 
the sources said tanai contacted gulbuddin hekmatyar a 
fundamentalist afghan guerrilla leader before fleeing and that one 
of hekmatyars commanders had been with tanai since the coup 
attempt was launched tuesday 
such an alliance would be more one of convenience and 
opportunism than ideology tanai a marxist hardliner has long 
advocated a harsh stance against the usbacked guerrillas and 
opposed president najibs attempts to make peace with them 
at the same time the radical fundamentalist hekmatyar has 
become increasingly estranged from his fellow moslem guerrilla 
leaders rejecting their political leadership and executing some of 
their followers 
pakistan should be a safe haven for tanai as its government 
strongly opposes the najib government 
earlier today a foreign diplomat said mutinous soldiers who 
had the support of guerrillas had seized control of bagram 30 
miles north of kabul 
a government spokesman denied it but acknowledged fighting at 
the base 
western diplomats and guerrilla leaders in pakistan said they 
also had reports of fighting between rival factions in the southern 
city of kandahar and the northwestern city of herat 
the diplomats and guerrilla sources all speaking on condition 
of anonymity also told of sporadic street fighting in kabul the 
capital and said mutinous air force pilots bombed the capital for 
a second day but were repulsed by loyalist troops 
afghanistans highestranking diplomat in pakistan charge 
daffaires qudratullah ahmadi denied there was widespread 
fighting there is only fighting in bagram all of afghanistan is 
quiet he told reporters in islamabad 
of the bagram battle ahmadi said this was a strong 
challenge this was their the mutineers last chance he denied 
the base had fallen 
but a foreign diplomat said all indications are that the 
mutineers are in control of bagram the diplomat added beyond 
that the situation in afghanistan is exceedingly unclear 
claims made by the kabul government and the moslem insurgents 
are often exaggerated and impossible to verify independently 
in a brief speech today on official radio kabul najib again 
claimed victory over the mutineers and said renegade soldiers were 
surrendering tanai has escaped his allies are defecting and 
those who do not surrender will be punished he said 
radio kabul said troops loyal to najib controlled kabul a city 
of 2 million but urged residents to stay indoors 
it also accused another highranking party member asadullah 
sarwari of involvement in the attempted overthrow sarwari was a 
former interior minister known as the butcher for hundreds of 
killings following the 1978 revolution that installed the communist 
government 
the whereabouts of sarwari was not immediately known 
najib who was installed as president by the soviets in december 
1986 said a number of people mostly civilians had been 
killed and injured since tuesday he gave no figures 
the government appealed to supporters to take up arms in 
defense hekmatyar leader of one of the most fundamentalist of the 
guerrilla groups that took up arms against the government 11 years 
ago claimed six soviet warplanes joined the governments fight a 
soviet official denied it 
hekmatyar offered his support to the mutineers within hours 
after planes began bombing the presidential palace tuesday 
afternoon 
a spokesman for hekmatyar said tanais forces controlled the 
kabul airport today but were under heavy rocket attack 
western diplomats and un officials in pakistan backed the 
report and said the chinese italian and indian embassies had been 
slightly damaged 
those sources also claimed troops loyal to najib were pounding 
the air base in bagram trying to rout tanais supporters radio 
kabul monitored in islamabad said najib had ordered the air force 
to bomb bagram 
guerrilla sources and pakistani officials claimed three 
highranking afghan generals flew a transport plane to the pakistan 
border and surrendered to the guerrillas one guerrilla source said 
the soldiers supported neither side and did not want to stay in 
afghanistan 
western diplomats and guerrilla sources said they also had 
reports of afghan helicopters and warplanes landing at towns along 
the border they said they did not know who was on the aircraft 
moscow withdrew its soldiers from afghanistan in february 1989 
after a nineyear military intervention in the war but it 
continues to ship arms to the afghan armed forces 
hekmatyar speaking in pakistan claimed moscow sent six 
warplanes from the bordering soviet republic of tadzhikistan to 
bomb bagram he said one soviet warplane was shot down 
a political officer at the soviet embassy in islamabad denied 
the allegations 
tanai and hekmatyar were linked to at least of two of the five 
previous reported attempts to oust najib who took office in 1986 
tanai belongs to a faction of the ruling party that is a bitter 
rival of najib 
he is said to have had many contacts with moslem guerrillas who 
took up arms after the 1978 coup that brought the communists to 
power 
hekmatyar told reporters tuesday in islamabad that he supports 
any attempt to oust najib if a coup succeeded he said the 
guerrillas would decide whether to negotiate for an islamic 
government or fight najibs successor 
hekmatyar a 42yearold engineer has has been accused by other 
resistance groups of killing rival guerrillas and innocent 
civilians and broke away from the governmentinexile formed by the 
guerrillas after the soviet withdrawal

andreotti one of italys most enduring politicians who is 
serving as prime minister for the sixth time was greeted with a 
prolonged standing ovation by members of the house senate and 
diplomatic corps 
the theme of his speech was the changing face of europe one 
with reduced superpower arsenals democratic governments throughout 
and an improved quality of life for its inhabitants 
the real issue today is how can we encourage change in the 
east without provoking repercussions that would stop its impetus 
andreotti said 
a new deal with the east should first of all include a drastic 
reduction of arms especially conventional weapons which threaten 
us europeans in terms of proximity and continuity he said 
the united states soviet union and their allies are negotiating 
sharp reductions in conventional weapons arsenals a treaty may be 
ready for signing by years end 
we want to continue building a europe that is open to the 
world not a fortress europe as some mistakenly fear he said 
italy assumes the chairmanship of the european economic 
community in july and andreotti has been assuring the united states 
that the process of unifying the markets of the 12 member nations 
is not meant to exclude the united states 
the new europe will be ever ready to collaborate in a spirit 
of true partnership with the united states whose military presence 
in europe must remain as a guarantee of stability and 
balance andreotti said 
moreover we want this new europe that is being built to 
develop new and increasingly close and effective forms of linkage 
with this essential partner nation 
italy and other west european countries are concerned the united 
states might reduce its commitment to europe in response to the 
declining danger from the soviet union and the rising influence a 
united germany is expected to wield 
a reunited germany which is expected to emerge by the end of 
the year has an essential anchorage in nato and a secure 
guarantee in the larger assembly of the 35 signatories of the 
helsinki agreements he said the 1975 agreements ratified the 
european borders set after world war ii 
italy and other european countries are worried that a united 
germany might lay claim to lands taken away from the vanquished 
germany of adolf hitler poland has been especially worried because 
onethird of its territory used to be german 
andreotti has also voiced concerns that italy and other nato 
allies might be overlooked in the twoplusfour approach to 
german unification the twoplusfour are the two germanys and 
the four world war ii victors the united states great britain 
france and the soviet union 
andreotti received assurances from his us hosts that italy 
would not be ignored in the discussions expected to begin later 
this month

the air force spent 81397 on a c5a cargo 
plane pilot seat when a similar model was available for about 
16000 a lawmaker said wednesday in accusing the pentagon of 
continuing to buy overpriced spare parts 
rep barbara boxer dcalif also criticized the defense 
departments procurement chief john betti for his order to 
civilian auditors discouraging the withholding of program funds if 
they suspected waste fraud abuse or mismanagement by a contractor 
under the jan 28 directive betti said he or his deputy would 
have the authority to withhold payments to contractors to ensure 
that the step is taken only when absolutely necessary 
it in no way indicates any reduction in my desire for 
disciplined and responsive management of our acquisition 
programs betti said in the order rather it signals my belief 
that selfdisciplined and responsible program managers are a more 
responsive and costeffective control system than are a series of 
hierarchical reviews 
but boxer told reporters at a capitol hill news conference that 
betti took away the one main tool that had been given to 
civilian auditors 
i think he is bowing to the demands of the services as opposed 
to the civilian side she said 
the congresswoman in a letter released wednesday urged betti 
to rescind his order saying his decision sends the wrong signal 
to defense contractors and those in the services responsible for 
programs 
boxer who in the mid1980s disclosed the pentagon paid 7400 
for a coffee brewer and 539 for arm rests used the news 
conference to show that the public and congressional outcry has 
forced the department to buy similiar items at a cheaper price 
the air force recently spent 283 on a commercial coffee maker 
for its c5 aircraft and is repairing damaged arm rests for a mere 
25 
however the pentagon is still blowing taxpayers money on 
spare parts boxer said 
we have found other parts outside the glare of publicity where 
the air force had returned to its old ways of accepting overcharges 
on spare parts she said 
but defense department spokesman glenn flood said that across 
the board the pentagon was making progress in keeping prices 
down 
in 1988 the air force bought one webermanufactured pilot seat 
for 81397 for the c5a aircraft and eight more seats at 29476 
each but for the c5b aircraft the air force bought 16047 seats 
made by ipeco 
the air force says the weber and ipeco seats are 
interchangeable boxer said 
in addition the air force purchased 4000 eightday clocks at a 
cost of 596 each but a supplier contacted by the project for 
government procurement said it could supply clocks meeting the same 
specifications for 270 each boxer said

sudans top relief official said his 
nation may be forced to reconsider its liberal relief policies if 
foreign aid does not increase to match a growing influx of 
ethiopian refugees 
refugee commissioner abdulrahman sir elkhatem also appealed 
for worldwide pressure to help persuade ethiopia to allow delivery 
of relief supplies inside its borders to help slow the flood of 
refugees crossing the frontier 
sir elkhatem said 11800 ethiopian refugees fled to eastern 
sudan in the last week of february bringing to 35800 the number 
of new arrivals in that month 
foreign officials said they expect tens of thousands of new 
refugees in the coming weeks and sir elkhatems office already 
counts 12 million refugees in sudan mostly ethiopians 
the un high commissioner for refugees disputed the figures and 
said no more than 800000 refugees were in sudan 
it was unclear what action sudan could take to halt the refugees 
who cross the huge mostly unmarked and unguarded border to escape 
war and famine 
assistance from the international community to refugees in 
sudan is decreasing while the influx across sudans eastern border 
is increasing sir elkhatem was quoted as saying by the 
government newspaper alsudan alhadith 
he said budget cuts at the un relief organization led to a 50 
percent reduction in spending at its khartoum office which might 
force us to change our permanent policy towards refugees 
in eastern sudan sir elkhatems office operates six 
unfinanced reception camps and 16 settlements for refugees many 
still house people who fled the 198485 famine in ethiopia that is 
believed to have killed a million people 
sir elkhatem did not spell out what steps sudan is likely to 
take if more refugee aid does not arrive 
he also said sudan will allow relief agencies to transport food 
through sudanese territory and across the frontier into ethiopia

irans president today said the problem 
of the western hostages held in lebanon is nearing a solution but 
a group holding two americans said it has no intention of freeing 
the captives 
the revolutionary justice organization also accused the united 
states of planning a military operation to free the hostages and 
said we warn america away from what it calls the hard option 
because we are on alert we are today stronger and better prepared 
and more determined to hit out at strategic interests and deal 
painful blows 
president hashemi rafsanjani of iran said his country was not 
directly linked to the hostage issue but had pledged to use irans 
influence to seek their freedom 
my feeling is that the issue of the hostages is moving toward 
a solution irans official islamic republic news agency quoted 
him as saying 
he repeated irans demands that western nations help trace 
iranian hostages missing in lebanon and also reduce their 
mischievous acts irna said 
eighteen westerners including eight americans are missing in 
lebanon most believed held by shiite moslem groups loyal to 
tehran the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was abducted march 16 
1985 
rafsanjanis statements at a news conference followed a series 
of editorials in englishlanguage newspapers in tehran saying the 
hostages should be freed because they were being used as 
antiislamic propoganda syrian and other officials also have 
expressed optimism that the hostages may be freed 
in a handwritten statement issued today revolutionary justice 
said we tenaciously cling to keeping americas nose in the mud 
under our feet there is no intention to release hostages the 
statement was accompanied by a blackandwhite instant photograph 
of american hostage joseph cicippio of valley forge penn it was 
delivered to the beirut newspaper annahar and a western news 
agency 
cicippio acting comptroller of the american university of 
beirut was kidnapped sept 12 1986 revolutionary justice also 
claims to hold edward austin tracy an american author from 
vermont the date of his seizure is not known but the group made 
the claim of responsibility oct 21 1986 
by monitoring american moves here and there and through 
planting elements in regional american stations and after trailing 
some spies we have acquired accurate information that an american 
military operation is imminent against areas where the americans 
believe hostages are held the arabic statement said 
we call upon all to watch out against this threat and beware 
and be on the alert against what america is hatching the 
communique added 
in apparent reference to recent comments by lebanons most 
influential shiite moslem cleric the statement said the 
revolutionary justice organization holds spies and humanitarianism 
requires just punishment not a reward it did not elaborate 
the cleric sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah said in a sermon 
feb 23 that we have to think of finding a realistic and 
humanitarian means to free the foreign hostages 
fadlallah is spiritual guide of the proiranian hezbollah or 
party of god believed to be the umbrella for factions holding the 
captives 
revolutionary justice said it issued its communique after a 
comprehensive study of audio and printed statements and reactions 
about the hostages question and some issues and developments in the 
region 
on tuesday the tehran times said 1990 would be the last year 
for captivity for the hostages and that a resumption of ties to the 
united states was not a condition for their release 
several newspapers also have said the united states and iran 
were negotiating over the fate of the hostages which washington 
has denied 
rafsanjani denied that any such talks had occurred according to 
irna monitored in nicosia 
the president said the only official talks between the two 
nations are those carried out under the usiran claims tribunal 
in the netherlands under the auspices of the international court 
of justice 
the tribunal is sorting out billions of dollars in claims from 
contracts broken following the 1979 islamic revolution 
but he said the us officials themselves have established 
contacts with regional governments that was an apparent 
reference to us contacts with syria which as the main power 
broker in lebanon has facilitated past hostage releases diplomatic 
sources in the syrian capital damascus have said the united 
states used syria as an intermediary with tehran 
rafsanjanis brother mahmoud hashemi a highranking foreign 
ministry official was in damascus this week for meetings with the 
syrian foreign minister farouk alsharaa 
a syrian source said the talks were to coordinate policy on 
getting the hostages released and that hashemi had arrived from 
beirut where he also discussed the hostage issue with senior 
shiite moslem clergy 
rafsanjani echoed the recent tehran times editorials in saying 
the hostages should be released because their captivity was being 
used to smear the reputation of the islamic faith and the lebanese 
he also referred to recent statements by fadlallah and the 
tehran editorials as indicating there was new hope for the captives 
rafsanjani has indicated the desire to separate iran from the 
hostage issue as he seeks western technology and financing to 
rebuild irans troubled economy but the factions holding the 
hostages are said more loyal to radicals in the tehran government 
who oppose rafsanjani viewing confrontation with the west as the 
wellspring of the islamic revolution

oliver north will be the governments leadoff 
witness at john poindexters irancontra trial and poindexters 
lawyers are trying to limit the former white house aides 
testimony the judge in the case disclosed today 
ten additional people were sent into a pool of prospective 
jurors making a total of 45 and the jury for the trial was to be 
chosen this afternoon it will consist of 12 people plus six 
alternates 
us district court judge harold greene said he understood that 
north will be the first government witness in poindexters 
trial lawyers in the case later confirmed that north would be the 
first witness 
greene made the comment as he announced that poindexters 
lawyers are trying to limit norths potentially damaging testimony 
north met frequently with poindexter on the iran arms sale 
initiative resupply of the contras and the diversion of funds to 
the rebel force 
greene said he would consider a motion filed under seal by 
poindexter that seeks to limit some aspects of norths testimony 
based on fifth amendment rights against selfincrimination 
greene denied another motion by poindexter that would have 
struck all or part of norths upcoming testimony 
the government alleged at norths trial last year that he had 
given unreliable testimony when he took the witness stand in his 
own defense richard beckler a lawyer for poindexter said in 
explaining the basis for the motion 
opening statements are to be thursday morning and north could be 
on the stand for several days 
one of those picked for the pool tuesday was a retired defense 
department employee who may have confused the watergate scandal 
with the irancontra affair 
asked what last years trial of north focused on the defense 
department retiree a woman who worked at the army materiel command 
in alexandria va said it was about the tapes he had so many 
tapes he did erase oliver north and secretary 
in the watergate scandal thenpresident nixons secretary rose 
mary woods said she might have accidentally erased a portion of one 
taped conversation the tape in question was of a conversation 
between nixon and his chief of staff hr haldeman about how to 
handle the spreading fbi investigation of the watergate scandal 
also sent into the jury pool was a distribution clerk at dulles 
international airport outside washington who said he had heard 
that north was going to court but didnt know the outcome of 
last years trial in which poindexters onetime subordinate was 
convicted of three felonies 
asked whether he had heard of poindexter the man said that if 
he had i didnt pay any attention 
one juror was excused for failing to note on a questionnaire 
that she had sat on a jury previously a fact that came out during 
questioning 
greene noted there had been a big flap at norths trial last 
year over a juror who had answered the questionnaire incorrectly 
the juror in the north case tara king failed to note the fact 
that a number of relatives had been involved in criminal cases 
including one who served time in prison the issue is part of 
norths appeal now before the us court of appeals 
a truck driver who said i read the paper a lot was 
disqualified for jury duty after telling greene that poindexter 
might be guilty and saying of reagan 
i know he was in on it but i dont know if he did anything 
wrong 
poindexter is under indictment on charges of conspiracy two 
counts of obstructing congress and two counts of making false 
statements the charges relate to allegations that poindexter 
covered up norths secret resupply network to the contra rebels in 
nicaragua and to allegations that poindexter lied concerning a 
november 1985 shipment of hawk antiaircraft missiles to iran

president bushs cabinet has evolved into the 
most powerful in a quarter century even though it meets 
infrequently insiders and analysts suggest 
when it does convene two things distinquish it from cabinet 
sessions under former president reagan the vice president speaks 
out and theres no mistaking whos the secretary of housing and 
urban development 
the full bush cabinet gets together only about once a month but 
in some months it hasnt met at all the meetings seldom last more 
than an hour and usually are held in response to some event or trip 
for instance bush called his cabinet together monday to report 
on his california summit with japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu 
and to discuss the recent nicaraguan election 
but bushs 14member cabinet may wield more power and have more 
influence with the president than any since president eisenhowers 
in the 1950s at the same time bushs white house staff is one of 
the least powerful of recent presidencies analysts suggest and 
some top bush aides agree 
while eisenhower met with his cabinet almost once a week bush 
met with his full cabinet only 11 times last year and three times 
so far this year 
one reason he gathers his cabinet so infrequently is that he 
knows the members so well some of them treasury secretary james 
a baker iii commerce secretary robert a mosbacher and treasury 
secretary nicholas f brady are among his oldest friends 
he doesnt use the full cabinet as a decisionmaking body 
said david q bates who as cabinet secretary schedules sessions 
prepares the agenda and keeps the president informed of agency 
developments 
bush constantly telephones cabinet secretaries and bates said 
he often meets individually with them such as a lunch he had 
wednesday with mosbacher reducing the need for more frequent 
fullcabinet meetings 
the secretaries can call matters to the presidents attention by 
slipping a note into bates weekly report to bush on what each 
cabinet agency is doing 
roger porter bushs domestic policy adviser who also worked in 
the reagan white house said that reagan who once failed to 
recognize his own reticient housing secretary samuel pierce at a 
gathering of mayors also held infrequent cabinet meetings 
particularly near the end of his term 
the frequency of cabinet meetings tends to deteriorate over 
time porter said 
theres little chance bush would fail to recognize his housing 
secretary jack kemp according to white house aides kemp is one 
of the most forceful and frequent speakers at cabinet sessions 
often dominating the conversations 
in fact several white house aides suggested privately that the 
irrepressible kemps outspokenness may be one reason bush doesnt 
convene the full cabinet more often kemp does not fit into the 
oldfriend category 
does kemp talk too much at cabinet meetings not at all 
said kemp spokesman robert nipp but he does talk 
another major difference between the bush and reagan cabinets 
white house aides say vice president dan quayle frequently speaks 
up 
during reagan cabinet meetings vice president bush seldom did 
bush has retained a cabinet structure set up in the reagan 
presidency in which two subcabinet groups the domestic policy 
council and the economic policy council meet frequently on major 
policy issues 
the economic group includes the secretaries of treasury 
commerce agriculture labor transportation state and the trade 
representative the domestic group includes the attorney general 
and secretaries of interior energy health and human services 
education veterans affairs and housing and urban development 
budget director richard darman sits on both councils kemp 
doesnt but usually shows up at both anyway 
those councils augmented by the national security council are 
where the bulk of the administrations top policy decisions are 
forged not within the white house staff bush frequently drops in 
on the council sessions 
with the exception of chief of staff john sununu and darman few 
on the white house staff wield much real power senior white house 
officials say privately 
stuart eizenstat a washington lawyer who was president carters 
domestic policy adviser said bushs cabinet is stronger relative 
to the white house staff than any recent cabinet 
bush broke the mold by putting his closest friends in the 
cabinet instead of on the white house staff eizenstat said 
reagan brought a whole retinue of california cronies to the 
white house and carter gave many of his georgia friends top white 
house positions by contrast few on bushs white house staff have 
known or worked with him for more than several years 
eizenstat said carters cabinet met about once a week at the 
start and then about once every two weeks but he said carter 
didnt rely much on the sessions for making decisions 
cabinet meetings are not terribly illuminating sessions you 
dont want to have your secretary of agriculture voting on whether 
to have an mx or midgetman missile system eizenstat said

one in three people suffer pangs of guilt along 
with pangs of hunger for a snack and 11 percent said they feel 
guiltier quenching their craving for the munchies than cheating on 
their taxes a survey has found 
the survey released wednesday was conducted for continental 
baking co the maker of twinkies hostess cupcakes and ho hos 
a random sample of 1000 people over age 18 were contacted by 
telephone during the weekend of feb 2 and asked about their 
snacking habits and what bothered people more than snacking 
other findings included 10 percent said they feel more guilt 
snacking than lying to their spouse about how much money they 
spend and 18 percent said they would feel less guilt lying about 
their weight than grabbing a snack 
dr felix larocca whose medical practice specializes in dieting 
and eating disorders said the results add more evidence to how 
strong the temptation to eat sweets and desserts is in modern 
society 
its 10 am in the morning and you may be at work and you may 
be hungry why not have an apple instead youll probably eat a 
luscious pastry and while you do it talk about how you need to lose 
a few pounds said larocca 
snacks are the forbidden fruit said larocca who has 
operated a st louisbased program for mood and eating disorders 
since 1983 
but a spokesman for the snack food association said it doesnt 
seem fair to single out snack foods for their association with 
guilt 
theres no reason that people should feel guilty about 
snacking said al rickard spokesman for the alexandria 
vabased group weve always maintained that snacks should be 
eaten as part of an appropriate diet 
despite the guilt what will the average person give up to savor 
a snack 
according to the survey 40 percent would rather snack than 
shop 18 percent would rather snack than travel 29 percent would 
rather snack than go to the movies and 10 percent would rather 
snack than make love 
the survey was conducted by bruskin associates and had a margin 
of error of 3 percentage points

chiang wego the sole surviving son of 
generalissimo chiang kaishek has emerged as a wild card in the 
upcoming presidential election as his fathers aging cronies dream 
of reestablishing the family dynasty 
gen chiang is still highly respected by our mainland 
compatriots said teng chieh a prominent member of the electoral 
college that will chose a new president march 21 
the attention focusing on chiang wego a 73yearold retired 
general has come quickly after a career spent in the shadow of his 
father and elder brother chiang chingkuo who together led the 
nationalist chinese government for six decades first in china and 
then in taiwan 
his political star did not rise measurably when his brother died 
in 1988 and was succeeded by his handpicked vice president lee 
tenghui 
but president lee is shakily approaching his first major 
political test in which he must win the approval of the 752seat 
national assembly or electoral college to secure a sixyear term 
although lee already has received the ruling nationalist party 
endorsement the assembly is dominated by aging politicians who 
escaped to taiwan with chiang kaishek in 1949 after losing a civil 
war to the communists they still dream of returning victoriously 
to the chinese mainland 
the old guard assemblyman have not faced election since arriving 
in taiwan and have been frozen in office to support the nationalist 
claim to still be the legitimate government of all china 
while chiang wego shares their dream of returning to the 
mainland lee is a pragmatic taiwanborn politician more concerned 
with ruling this island of 20 million people 
about 200 assemblymen have defied lees choice of a top aide as 
running mate by openly supporting chiang for vice president many 
of them actually want chiang to be president but realize that a 
taiwanese must fill the top slot for political reasons 
chiang has responded by saying he would not actively seek the 
presidency or vice presidency but he added that there is nothing 
i can do to control the assemblymen he has refused to rule out 
accepting either position 
he also has accused media of misinterpreting remarks made in 
1985 by his brother who said if someone asks me whether anyone 
in my family would run for the next presidential term my reply is 
it cant be and it wont be 
the statement was widely viewed as referring to all relatives 
but chiang wego has claimed his brother was only referring to his 
sons 
lee is taking the challenge seriously and has scrambled to meet 
with assemblymen to shore up support the power struggle has 
stirred up the most serious political crisis in 40 years said 
lu yali history professor at national taiwan university 
among chiangs critics is the liberal weekly magazine 
journalist which said in an editorial that his activities exposed 
his backward thoughts muddled head unrestrained mind and weak 
will 
other critics say chiang still lives in the conservative past 
and has ignored calls for greater democracy 
most taiwanese view the aging mainland chinese assemblyman as an 
obstacle to democratic change and want them to be replaced by 
taiwanelected politicians but chiang has praised their refusal to 
step down 
as local industrialists press for direct trade with china 
chiang claims chinese communists are trying to destabilize taiwan 
through growing trade 
chiang wego was born in shanghai on oct 6 1916 some reports 
claim that he was the adopted son of chiang kaishek and that his 
real father was tai chitao the generalissimos close friend 
i dontt really know which is my father but i am happy to be 
the son of either of them he once said 
chiang likes to socialize swap jokes and sing popular songs at 
public gatherings he has practiced chinese boxing since he was a 
child and learned to fly helicopter at age 70 
educated in prestigious military academies in germany and the 
united states chiang joined the nationalist chinese army as 
lieutenant at 25 
he was assigned to several administrative positions and served 
as lieutenant general for 14 years until being promoted to full 
general in 1985 one year before retiring he is secretary general 
of the national security council widely viewed as a symbolic seat 
with little power 
many believe chiang kaishek prevented his sons career from 
advancing quicker to avoid criticism of nepotism others believe 
that chiang wego just was not qualified to tackle key postings 
he is a nice man to make friends with but not the type of 
person who fits the post of vice presidency said chang 
chungtung a history professor at national taiwan university 
noting the trend toward democratic reform since martial law was 
lifted in 1987 after 38 years chang believes the days of the 
chiang dynasty are over and that the taiwanese people would never 
accept another family member to rule

whether a bomb or a methane gas buildup caused an explosion that 
flattened a twostory bank building like an accordion killing 
three people and injuring 14 
a 12member team from the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms began assembling this morning in this rocky mountain ski 
resort to search for clues in the rubble of crested butte state 
bank 
the building except the vault was leveled by the blast 
firefighters and volunteers dug by hand through the rubble to pull 
out survivors heavy snow hampered rescue efforts and delayed the 
arrival of ambulances 
police chief hank smith said two restaurants had received bomb 
threats in the past week and one of them was evacuated 
im not ruling out a bomb and im not ruling out an explosion 
from methane buildup he said were just now beginning the 
investigation

received any bomb threats 
this came completely out of the blue he said we care 
about our coworkers and were not going to work in that situation

birmingham ala mayor richard arrington 
urged senators wednesday to approve a new civil rights bill and 
help his city end 16 years of costly litigation over its hiring and 
promotion practices 
arrington told the senate labor and human resources committee 
the terrible financial burden on the city from the court battle 
will continue indefinitely unless congress overturns a supreme 
court decision last year on affirmative action 
the supreme court ruled white birmingham firefighters may 
challenge a courtapproved 1981 agreement between the city the 
justice department and black workers giving preferential treatment 
to minorities and women in city jobs 
the proposed civil rights act of 1990 would overturn that ruling 
by permitting workers to challenge employment practices from court 
orders or consent decress only if they did not know about or were 
denied a chance to challenge the orders beforehand 
we are not here seeking a license to engage in unlawful 
reverse discrimination arrington testified we are not here 
seeking to gag the objections legitimate or otherwise of white 
employees to affirmative action 
but raymond p fitzpatrick jr attorney for the white 
firefighters told the committee congress should let the ruling 
stand saying the court had reaffirmed the fundamental 
principle that all americans are entitled to a day in court when 
they believed they have been wronged 
fitzpatrick hinted any legislation to reverse the court ruling 
would lead to another prolonged legal battle over its 
constitutionality 
he said the 1981 agreement approved by a federal judge has 
never been reviewed by an appeals court the city has spent nine 
years trying to block a court from reviewing its decree he said 
arrington said the new bill would guarantee everyone in hiring 
bias disputes the right to a day in court but would still allow 
cities and other employers the right to finality in litigation

money sex and prominent names have become 
the talk of the town in this staid midwestern city since a credit 
union failure spawned federal and state investigations and rumors 
of child prostitution 
james martin davis an attorney who has been involved in the 
case recently warned that omaha could be the first city in the 
history of the world to gossip itself to death 
no charges have been filed in connection with the sexual abuse 
and child prostitution allegations that began to circulate just 
weeks after the franklin community federal credit union closed on 
nov 4 1988 but the credit union is missing 39 million and a 
former manager is to stand trial 
since then a newspaper columnist facing unrelated child sex 
assault charges has resigned a former publisher and civic leader 
has spoken out grand juries are at work 
the saga began when federal regulators citing unsound fiscal 
practices closed the credit union which was organized to help 
north omahas poor 
soon stories began surfacing of alleged sexual abuse at parties 
thrown by credit union officials 
the rumors received new life earlier this year when a former 
legislator wrote a memo naming five prominent people who he said 
were the focus of allegations that could be heard in bars or barber 
shops the memo was eventually leaked to thousands of people 
last weekend retired omaha worldherald publisher harold 
andersen who served on an advisory board for the credit union had 
enough 
he issued a statement acknowledging his name had been raised in 
rumors and saying there was not a shred of truth to the 
allegations 
his statement came one day after an omaha television station 
reported that andersen and four other people were named in a 
federal grand jury subpoena seeking information from an 
investigator for a legislative committee probing franklin 
in december 1988 the legislatures executive board received 
information in a closed hearing from the state foster care review 
board on allegations of abuse of foster children at parties thrown 
by franklin officials 
a new york times story based on information submitted to the 
executive board described the alleged sexual incidents as 
reminiscent of slave auctions 
state sen ernie chambers the executive board vice chairman 
said that was a genteel way of characterizing it 
but last year omaha police and the fbi said their 
investigations indicated there was no substance to the allegations 
the state attorney general and the state patrol agreed 
the legislatures franklin committee questioned whether the 
allegations were adequately investigated 
in december committee chairman loran schmit said the panel had 
21 hours of videotaped statements from three victimwitnesses 
who said they were sexually abused 
now a state grand jury is investigating allegations of child 
sexual abuse and child prostitution a federal grand jury already 
has investigated alleged financial wrongdoing that led to 
franklins failure and another is ready to investigate the child 
sexual abuse allegations 
former state sen john decamp now a lobbyist said his memo 
listing the five names forced state attorney general robert spire 
to seek a state grand jury investigation 
the news media did not report the names in decamps memo but a 
potential legislative candidate obtained a copy and mailed the 
contents to 10000 omaha households 
after worldherald columnist peter citron was arrested feb 23 
on two counts of child sexual abuse unrelated to franklin his 
attorney told reporters that the 50yearold writer was named in 
the decamp memo 
were suffering here in omaha under a firestorm of suspicion 
and we have hurricaneforce rumors said his attorney davis who 
warned about the gossip 
citron has denied any involvement in franklinrelated matters 
but has resigned 
as for the money missing from the credit union the national 
credit union administration filed a lawsuit against lawrence e 
king jr franklins manager alleging that he diverted money from 
franklin for his personal use and for his businesses 
king a wealthy black businessman who sang the national anthem 
at the 1984 republican national convention is scheduled for trial 
in june on 40 counts charging conspiracy fraud and filing false 
tax returns

environmentalists want bob hope to donate his 
7400 acres of land in the santa monica mountains to a national

hope the largest private landholder in the coastal range north 
of los angeles has optioned most of the land he acquired in the 
1950s to developers who plan golf courses and highpriced homes 
said payson wolff an attorney for hope 
mr hope regards his properties as investments and he is 
fully entitled to a fair return on them wolff said tuesday 
its presumptuous for people to say that he should give his land 
away if he wants to sell it more power to him 
supporters of a vast santa monica mountains national recreation 
area which includes an oceanfront stretch near malibu say 
acquiring hopes land is crucial because the national park service 
cannot compete with developers

critical ones said joseph t edmiston director of the staterun 
santa monica mountains conservancy which works with the park 
service to acquire land 
one 339acre oceanfront tract in malibus corral canyon is under

the requirement that the postal service and 
its unions go to binding arbitration when they cannot reach 
agreement on a contract should be changed the chairman of the post 
offices governing board said wednesday 
leaders of the two biggest unions representing postal workers 
immediately rejected the suggestion from robert setrakian 
contracts with the major unions representing postal workerts expire 
this year 
i think its a very very bad idea said vincent sombrotto 
president of the national association of letter carriers final 
and binding arbitration was made part of the postal reorganization 
act to balance the inability of postal employees having the right 
strike 
moe biller head of the american postal workers union 
responded if they want to give us the right to strike thats 
fine but other than that its obvious that he either knows nothing 
about the collective bargaining process or he doesnt want 
collective bargaining 
both biller and sombrotto stressed they would rather work out a 
contract agreement with postal mamnagement than go to arbitration 
several postal board members told the house post office 
committee they think changes are needed in the arbitration process 
although not necessarily those proposed by setrakian 
testifying a day after the postal service announced plans for a 
rate increase next year setrakian said labor accounts for 83 
percent of postal spending 
setrakian told the committee that when a dispute goes to 
arbitration the final result is usually to take the baby and cut 
it in half since both sides know arbitration will likely result 
in the difference between them being split they consider that in 
their negotiations said setrakian 
management and labor should be forced to come together he said 
and the element of uncertainty should be increased for example he 
suggested the president or a special committee of congress could be 
allowed to settle an impasse 
postal governor ira hall suggested another solution might be a 
limited arbitration in which the arbitrator may only choose the 
position of one side or the other and not to divide their 
differences 
that said hall would force both sides to get as close as 
possible before going to arbitration 
but sombrotto said its kind of a cynical approach to say 
that all the arbitrators do is to split the difference both he 
and biller said postal contracts have only gone to arbitration once 
in recent decades 
setrakian also suggested responsibility for raising rates should 
be left to the board of governors instead of the current system of 
sending a plan to the independent postal rate commission which then 
can take nearly a year to make a decision other board members 
attending the meeting did not join him in that idea however 
his proposal came a week after several members of the rate 
commission told the committee they should have final authority for 
setting rates 
currently the governors send a rate plan to the commission it 
considers the matter and sends back its own rate plan 
if both groups agree new rates take effect if not the 
governors can ask the commission to reconsider accept the 
commission plan or overrule it but to overule they must vote 
unanimously 
mustering a unanimous vote is a difficult task most times and 
would be even less likely this year considering that the governors 
voted only 64 to submit this years proposed increase in the first 
place

the prosecution rested its case today 
against joseph hazelwood after a defense lawyer tried to poke holes 
in an experts testimony that the skipper was drunk while in 
command of the exxon valdez 
richard prouty acknowledged his method of calculating backwards 
to determine someones prior level of intoxication is a subject of 
dispute among experts he also said his results would have been 
different if he had different facts about hazelwoods liquor 
consumption before he boarded the tanker 
prouty said he was told by prosecutors that hazelwood drank five 
shots of 100proof vodka in a period seven hours before he boarded 
the ship on the night it ran aground 
defense attorney dick madson asked if proutys conclusions would 
be different if hazelwood had only two or three drinks of vodka 
with a lower potency beginning just four hours before boarding the 
ship witnesses gave different accounts of hazelwoods drinking on 
that day 
prouty said the figures would definitely be different and would 
not reach the 014 percent blood alcohol level he concluded 
hazelwood had at the time of the grounding 
prouty was the states 45th and final witness in 4 weeks of 
testimony 
superior court judge karl johnstone told jurors they shouldnt 
form any opinions before hearing the defense witnesses you 
havent heard it all he said 
hazelwoods lawyers contend the defendant wasnt drunk when the 
tanker rammed a reef march 24 setting off the nations worst oil 
spill 
prouty chief forensic toxicologist with the oklahoma medical 
examiners office said he used a combination of figures to 
calculate backwards from blood and urine tests done on 
hazelwood 10 hours after the grounding 
he said hazelwoods blood alcohol level would have been 14 
percent at 1205 am when the tanker ran aground in prince william 
sound 
the legal limit in alaska for driving a car is 10 percent the 
coast guard has a limit of 04 for operating a commercial vessel 
but jurors werent told of the regulation because hazelwood is 
charged under state law not federal 
evidence on whether hazelwood was drunk has been inconclusive 
but the issue remains a key factor in the prosecutions effort to 
prove he was reckless 
crew members have testified that except for alcohol on his 
breath their captain showed no signs of being drunk when he 
boarded the ship in valdez four hours before the grounding and 
they said he was calm and in control of the ship after the disaster 
but prouty said he has seen cases of men with a blood alcohol 
level of 20 who showed no signs of being drunk 
assistant district attorney brent cole asked whether prouty 
would consider a person with a level of 14 to be impaired in 
reasoning and decisionmaking 
it is my opinion they definitely would be impaired prouty 
said 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is charged with criminal 
mischief reckless endangerment operating a vessel while 
intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil he could get up to 7 
years in prison and 61000 in fines 
the exxon valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of alaska 
crude into prince william sound killing countless birds fish and 
other wildlife and polluting hundreds of miles of rocky shoreline 
with black goo 
in 4 weeks of testimony prosecutors have sought to show that 
hazelwood was reckless in leaving a third mate in charge of the 
bridge during the ships passage into the sound they maintained 
also that he recklessly tried to run the ship off jagged bligh reef 
after the grounding 
underlying the recklessness charge is the claim of intoxication 
when hazelwood was tested at about 1030 am on march 24 his 
blood alcohol reading was 061 prouty said he calculated 
backwards in time considering hazelwoods height weight and an 
estimate that he stopped drinking at 8 pm 
the toxicologist said accurate and specific information is 
critical in attempting such a calculation 
its desirable to know the individuals body size and weight 
what the person was drinking when he started what type of 
beverage he consumed and when he stopped prouty said he 
indicated he also usually figures in what a person had to eat 
there are conflicts among witnesses over how much hazelwood 
drank when he drank it and when he stopped in addition there has 
been testimony suggesting the skipper drank a lowalcohol beer 
after the grounding 
hazelwoods history of drunken driving convictions and his 
participation in an alcohol rehabilitation program are inadmissible 
and jurors will not be told about them

life in cooper is just the way its 
residents like it they know each other by name and people smile 
when they speak to strangers at millers corner drugstore high 
school football dominates the conversation and the milkshakes are 
homemade 
but one constant dependable part of that life has abruptly come 
unglued greyhound is on strike and cooper is one of 9000 
communities where the companys buses provide the only intercity 
transportation 
ive only sold one ticket since the strike started and that 
person knew about the strike and wound up hitching a ride to 
dallas said marion miller who runs the family drugstore with 
his father manton 
actually its a good thing he didnt wait around because the 
bus was an hour and a half late said the younger miller whose 
store doubles as the bus station in this town of 2315 people 80 
miles northeast of dallas 
greyhound lines inc americas only nationwide bus system has 
been limping along since its 6300 drivers and about 3000 office 
and maintenance workers went on strike the union which walked out 
friday over wage and job security issues has asked for new talks 
but none are scheduled 
the company has been operating a reduced schedule during the 
6dayold strike using about 700 replacement drivers plus union 
members who cross picket lines greyhound said wednesday its 
ridership tuesday was 371 percent of the same day last year an 
increase from monday 338 percent and fridays 30 percent 
but bus travel in small towns such as cooper has slowed to a 
virtual crawl 
in a small town its more of a sporadic stream of business 
the younger miller said i might have five or six people in a day 
trying to catch a bus but then on other days i might not have 
any 
manton miller said he normally sells about 10 tickets a week 
greyhound pays him 75 a week to serve as agent but some of his 
regular customers are business people who regularly use the bus to 
ship and receive supplies ranging from auto parts to bull semen 
it would be kind of hard for farmers and breeders to schedule 
the semen shipments for their artificial breeding that stuff has 
to be refrigerated and i dont think it can stand to be left around 
for more than two or three days he said 
before the strike four buses passed through cooper daily on the 
route between texarkana and dallas but this week manton miller 
said no buses stopped by his store 
he said the limited bus service resulting from the strike 
reminds him of a time about two years ago when a woman told him 
that it took a rookie bus driver more than 90 minutes to make the 
20mile trip from the town of paris 
thats the kind of problems they have when theyre training 
these new drivers he said when youve got to fill in your 
schedule with all new people youre just asking for problems 
since delta county has evolved from an economy driven by 
agriculture to one struggling to fuel itself by light industry a 
prolonged strike could cripple local businesses that depend on 
greyhounds freight service 
well its going to hurt us said bonnie oats who runs a 
clothing manufacturing plant with her husband zane 
mrs oats said they often receive up to three supply shipments a 
week and the convenience provided by the bus schedules is 
invaluable she said 
we can depend on the bus you dont ever know when ups is 
going to get here she said

text of the statement released wednesday 
by the revolutionary justice organization as translated by the 
associated press bureau in beirut 
in the name of the powerful almighty 
after a comprehensive study of audio and printed statements and 
reactions about the hostages question and some issues and 
developments in the region the revolutionary justice organization 
announces the following 
first during the prolonged american darkness that has engulfed 
the region all have fallen into us traps intentions are 
obscured guns have been deviated and rules of classifying friends 
and foes by members of the same ranks have changed painful stabs 
have been dealt to our essential causes strugglers and martyrs 
have fallen in the arenas of shame everywhere with america behind 
them above them and in between them not to say inside of them all 
in this deluge and in spite of all the revolutionary justice 
organization remains and remains and remains holding to its 
positions and directing all its efforts and strugglers against 
america and its allies only america and its allies the 
organization counsels all that this is the right and sole course to 
which suicide strugglers and special operations should be directed 
they should wake up and ponder what they do 
in this atmosphere the united states has raised the question of 
the hostages from a humanitarian angle but by monitoring american 
moves here and there and through planting elements in regional 
american stations and after trailing some spies we have acquired 
accurate information that an american military operation is 
imminent against areas where the americans believe hostages are 
held we call upon all to watch out against this threat and beware 
and be on the alert against what america is hatching 
we are sorry over some irresponsible declarations by local 
friends in this regard that may have resulted from failing to 
understand the nature of the american movements and we call upon 
them to concentrate their humanitarian attempts on areas that can 
be more positive and more productive 
second the revolutionary justice organization holds spies and 
humanitarianism requires just punishment not a reward we warn 
america away from what it calls the hard option because we are are 
on alert we are today stronger and better prepared and more 
determined to hit out at strategic interests and deal painful 
blows washington realizes more than anyone else that our strength 
today is not that of yesterday 
third we tenaciously hold to keeping americas nose in the mud 
under our feet there is no intention to release hostages no one

bank profits tumbled 34 percent in 1989 held 
back in the last half of the year by mounting real estate woes in 
the northeast and debt troubles in the third world 
the nations commercial banks earned 163 billion down from a 
record 248 billion in 1988 the federal deposit insurance corp 
said wednesday 
the contrast between the first six months of the year and the 
last half was dramatic in the januaryjune period banks posted 
143 billion in earnings the best ever for six months compared 
with a weak 2 billion in the final half 
fourth quarter earnings were held to 27 billion after the 
industry set aside 84 billion to cover losses on domestic loans 
most of the problems centered on real estate development lending 
but the percentage of sour consumer loans edged up for the fifth 
consecutive year to 16 percent 
in the third quarter big banks set aside 76 billion to cover 
third world debt losses producing a rare loss for the industry of 
740 million it was the worst showing since the second quarter of 
1987 when a previous round of reserving for developing country 
loans caused a 106 billion loss 
banks in the oilproducing southwest continued to recover slowly 
from the oil and real estate busts earlier in the mid1980s but 
northeastern banks deteriorated sharply western and midwest banks 
showed strong gains and southeastern institutions held steady 
bad real estate loans more than doubled in the northeast where 
four states were among the 10 with the highest percentage of sour 
real estate loans 
the bostonbased bank of new england alone lost 11 billion 
last year most of it in real estate 
despite the problems banks continued to pour money into real 
estate lending particularly in the southeast and west real estate 
lending increased 128 percent nationally compared with a 54 
percent growth rate for bank assets generally 
five of the countrys 10 largest banks were in the red last 
year primarily because of provisions for losses on developing 
country loans they were chase manhattan morgan guaranty 
manufacturers hanover bankers trust and chemical bank 
the chairman of the fdic l william seidman predicted that the 
industrys performance would improve this year at least in the 
first six months private analysts were less optimistic 
we are in a particularly vicious real estate cycle said 
economist paul getman of regional financial associates of 
philadelphia i think youre going to get more bad news 
particularly in the southeast in florida georgia the carolinas 
because there was a lot of speculative buying there 
seidman however said all is not on the black side there 
was some good news particularly small community banks showed 
improving earnings much of the third world loan problems 
would appear to be behind most of the large banks 
in another positive sign the list of problem banks which 
the fdic uses to predict bank failures stood at 1093 at the end 
of 1989 down from 1394 a year earlier and 1559 at the end of 
1987 
seidman forecast fewer bank failures in 1990 compared with last 
year when 206 banks failed or required government assistance to 
stay open 
the failures and a spate of mergers reduced the number of banks 
to 12706 at the end of 1989 compared with a peak of 14496 five 
years earlier

the bush administration on wednesday welcomed 
more hopeful statements from iran about the american hostages 
in lebanon while members of congress pressed for a special envoy to 
deal with the situation 
in beirut meanwhile the revolutionary justice organization a 
group claiming to hold two american hostages said it had no 
intention of releasing them 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said administration 
officials were encouraged by the comments of iranian president 
hashemi rafsanjani who said there might be a solution soon 
they certainly are more hopeful than what weve heard in the 
more distant past he said of rafsanjanis remarks 
rafsanjani was quoted by the islamic republic news agency as 
saying my feeling is that the issue of the hostages is moving 
towards a solution 
but he also said western nations must help trace iranian 
hostages missing in lebanon and also reduce their mischievous 
acts 
revolutionary justice the group that claims to hold joseph 
cicippio of valley forge pa and edward austin tracy an american 
author said there is no intention to release hostages the 
statement delivered to beirut newspaper annahar and a western 
news agency was accompanied by a blackandwhite instant 
photograph of cicippio 
us officials made clear they did not see rafsanjanis 
statements as portending any immediate release of eight missing 
americans most if not all of whom are thought to be held by 
proiranian shiite moslems in lebanon all told there are 18 
western hostages 
but officials described the comments as positive fitzwater 
called them in line with statements that we have seen in recent 
days and weeks that there was some interest in iran in better 
relations with the west 
we hope that thats the case and that it will result in 
release of the hostages he said at a briefing before reports of 
the revolutionary justice communique 
fitzwater said the united states did not have direct knowledge 
of mr rafsanjanis motives or purposes in making those remarks 
but a state department official familiar with the hostage issue 
said he believed the iranians wont be able to get the economic 
aid and credit they seek from the west so long as hostages remain 
in lebanon 
i think they realize there is no longer any benefit to holding 
the hostages he said speaking on condition he remain anonymous 
amid the flurry of reports about the hostages a house foreign 
affairs subcommittee referred to the full panel a proposed sense 
of congress resolution that the president should designate a 
special envoy to negotiate the release of american hostages in 
lebanon 
the measure was introduced by rep louise slaughter dny who 
said she also hoped to draw attention to the march 16 date marking 
the fifth year of captivity for terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press 
we cannot replace those lost years but we owe it to terry to 
his little girl and to the seven other american hostages to secure 
their release she said 
anderson the longestheld american hostage has a daughter born 
3 months after he was seized 
sen daniel moynihan dny has proposed a companion senate 
resolution a concurrent resolution does not go to the president 
for his signature so it does not have the force of law but it puts 
congress on record 
us officials usually oppose the idea of special envoys a 
state department official said remember terry waite he was a 
special envoy the official said referring to the anglican 
churchman who was seized in beirut while trying to free the 
hostages 
we have mechanisms for talking with the iranians and we arent 
sure there is anything to gain from talking directly to the 
hostageholders the official said 
another official also speaking on condition of anonymity said 
weve been talking for a long time to anyone who could have 
influence algerians syrians we talk to the iranians through a 
lot of people we have talked to enough people that the message has 
gotten through to the iranians 
the message said the official who demanded anonymity is we 
know you want access to the west youve said you are against 
terrorism we want to see action 
the official us policy is not to deal directly with the 
iranians there are no us government talks spokeswoman 
margaret d tutwiler said 
iran is believed to exert considerable influence over hezbollah 
the umbrella group for the radical shiite moslems

one of the nations most successful computer 
software designers cautioned congress wednesday against passing 
laws that would overprotect intellectual property by extending 
copyright protection to ideas 
its the nature of software for ideas to slosh and flow back 
and forth between competitors companies and industries mitchell 
d kapor told a house subcommittee if as a software designer i 
can use a program and learn from it without copying its internals 
then i should be free to use the knowledge that ive gained as long 
as i expressed the ideas in my own way 
the subcomittee is considering a revision of laws governing 
intellectual property a phrase covering copyrights patents and 
trade secrets and heard from kapor software designer daniel s 
bricklin and government officials concerned with copyrights and 
patents software refers to sets of instructions for computers 
whether the instructions are stored on punched cards magnetic 
tape disks or chips 
kapor designed a spreadsheet known as lotus 123 which became 
a standard of the computer industry and made lotus development 
corp which he founded one of the most successful software firms 
in the country the firm is involved in a copyright suit against 
two competitors 
there is no question as i look at my industry that there has 
been an unsteady but stubborn march to extend the scope of 
copyright kapor said twisting and straining each step of the 
way to secure additional copyright protections too many companies 
seem to have decided that its easier to sue their rivals than 
compete with them 
litigation is becoming a business tactic not a practice of 
last resort software should not be an industry driven by 
litigation said kapor adding that he was not complaining about 
the lawsuit 
kapor said he sees no way to prevent potential competitors from 
profitiing from his companys efforts 
if they can replicate our efforts or go them one better 
because our approach inspired them to do so more power to them 
he said i would only call my lawyer if we found that these 
competitors had not just copied the idea but the actual lines of 
code underlying it 
james w curlin of the congressional office of technology 
assessment presented the committee with an ota study that said the 
united states 70 percent share of the worlds computer software 
market could shrink without better legal protection 
with continued innovation the united states can keep outshining 
its foreign competitors the study said claiming that intellectual 
property protection encourages innovation by providing incentives 
for creation and security for investors 
last year software and related services were a 60 billion 
industry in the united states

presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
compared house majority leader richard a gephardt to televisions 
bumbling secret agent maxwell smart on wednesday and said its 
hard to figure out what hes up to 
fitzwater took issue with the missouri democrats stinging 
rebuke of bush and his proposal for direct economic aid to the 
soviet union 
hes hard to believe fitzwater said at his daily white 
house news briefing hes the maxwell smart of politics do you 
believe he wants to raise taxes on the american people to give 
money to the soviet union 
the presidents spokesman did not elaborate on his reference to 
the wellintentioned but selfimportant and clumsy hero of the 
1960s get smart comedy series 
gephardt spokeswoman deborah johns said the majority leader did 
not wish to respond to fitzwaters characterization 
secretary of state james a baker iii testifying wednesday on 
capitol hill said there is no need or direct financial aid to 
moscow and they havent asked for it 
we ought to support the reform efforts in the soviet union 
baker said asked whether communism has ceased to be a threat he 
added we ought not to gloat too much over our success it is 
not overlyproductive to stick a stick in their eye just for the 
hell of it 
gephardt on tuesday accused bush of presiding over a government 
of the polls by the polls and for the polls 
the bush foreign policy is a policy adrift without vision 
without imagination without a guiding light save precious public 
opinion polls gephardt said in speech to the center for national 
policy a liberal research organization 
gephardt also proposed direct aid to the soviet union and 
accused bush of a lack of vision for not doing more to 
encourage and embrace changes in the soviet union and eastern 
europe 
the 1988 democratic presidential contender proposed food aid to 
the soviets along with other forms of assistance and a lifting of 
trade restrictions 
well i dont know that gephardt its hard to figure out 
what hes up to fitzwater said 
i mean the soviet union has indicated that they dont want 
direct support they have not made economic reforms that would be 
able to use that kind of support he added 
fitzwater noted sen bill bradley dnj and other democrats 
had opposed the gephardt proposal as pouring money down a 
rathole

it cost the government 185000 to tell people 
they bought social security information they couldve gotten for 
free and didnt get the right material at that 
the general accounting office on wednesday issued a report on 
the social security protection bureau a private company that has 
come under criticism for offering benefits considered by many to be 
of dubious value 
the 7 fee for membership in the bureau brings help in getting 
earnings information from the governments social security 
administration information that is available for free directly 
from ssa the gao said 
the report said the bureau appears to operate without 
violating federal legal requirements but not without cost to 
the government 
the social security administration has processed more than 
350000 requests for earnings and benefit information generated by 
the private company the gao said 
it cost the government 900000 to process those requests 
including 185000 in extraordinary expenses because the 
company had given people outdated government forms for requesting 
the earnings information 
the 185000 was spent to send people letters explaining that 
they had spent 7 for what they could have received free and asking 
them to submit the new revised request form the gao said 
at the same time the social security protection bureau could 
have received 2 million in membership fees from those 350000 new 
members 
the social security protection bureau is the trade name for 
foxhall corp which is controlled by watson amp hughey co a 
partnership that has grown into a multimilliondollar business 
promoting nonprofit groups 
watson amp hughey has been criticized because the partnership 
not the charitable organizations gets most of the money obtained 
from the public the gao said thirteen states have taken action 
against watson amp hughey because of possible violations related to 
nonprofit organizations and consumer protection 
attorney michael kushnick who represents watson amp hughey said 
he had not seen the gao report but stressed the bureaus operations 
did not violate the law 
kushnick said if the information requests cost the government 
money i think the benefits to the consumer in getting this 
information probably outweighed those costs

a proiranian underground group holding 
two american hostages in lebanon said wednesday it does not intend 
to release the captives and it urged attacks on us targets 
the group also accused the united states of planning a military 
operation to free the 18 western captives 
the statement was released by the revolutionary justice 
organization just hours after iranian president hashemi rafsanjani 
said he wants the issue of westerners held in lebanon resolved it 
followed a flurry of news reports that had raised hopes some 
hostages might be released 
we tenaciously cling to keeping americas nose in the mud 
under our feet there is no intention to release hostages 
revolutionary justice said in an arabiclanguage statement 
delivered to the independent beirut newspaper annahar and a 
western news agency 
the handwritten statement was accompanied by a blackandwhite 
photograph of hostage joseph cicippio of valley forge pa 
cicippio acting comptroller of the american university of beirut 
was kidnapped sept 12 1986 in lebanon 
the group said suicide strugglers and special operations 
should be directed against the united states and its allies 
adding this was the right and sole course 
in the picture cicippio dressed in a striped sweater over a 
tshirt looked straight into the camera he was without his 
eyeglasses and had a bushy grayish beard his hair was disheveled 
the statement was the first from revolutionary justice since 
aug 3 when the group announced it had reversed a decision to kill 
cicippio 59 the execution had been threatened to retaliate for 
israels abduction of a shiite moslem cleric from southern lebanon 
by monitoring american moves here and there and through 
planting elements in regional american stations and after trailing 
some spies we have acquired accurate information that an american 
military operation is imminent against areas where the americans 
believe hostages are held the statement said 
we call upon all to watch out against this threat and beware 
and be on the alert against what america is hatching the 
communique added 
in an apparent reference to recent comments made by lebanons 
leading shiite cleric the communique said the revolutionary 
justice organization holds spies and humanitarianism requires just 
punishment not a reward 
on feb 23 the clergyman sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah 
said a realistic and humanitarian means must be found to free 
the hostages 
the statement was one of several recent developments that had 
raised hopes a solution may be in the works 
editorials in englishlanguage iranian newspapers have said the 
hostages should be freed because they are being used as 
antiislamic propaganda syrian and other officials also have 
expressed optimisim the captives may be freed 
rafsanjani in his most direct statement so far that he wants 
the hostages freed said wednesday i and my friends would like 
the issue to be settled since the united states and others are 
exploiting the matter as a means for branding the lebanese as 
terrorists and so they are not seriously seeking a solution 
rafsanjani said iran was not directly linked to the hostage 
issue but that he had pledged to use irans influence to seek 
their freedom 
my feeling is that the issue of the hostages is moving toward 
a solution he said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush administration 
officials were encouraged by rafsanjanis comments they 
certainly are more hopeful that what weve heard in the more 
distant past fitzwater said 
rafsanjani is believed to be eager to obtain the captives 
release because he wants to improve ties with the west but 
radicals opposed to him see confrontation with the west as the 
wellspring of the islamic revolution and are believed to hold 
greater sway over the hostageholders 
revolutionary justice also holds american writer edward austin 
tracy 58 of burlington vt who was kidnapped oct 21 1986 
there are six other americans held hostage including terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
anderson kidnapped march 16 1985 has been held longer than any 
hostage 
the other hostages are four britons two west germans two 
swiss an irishman and an italian 
we warn america away from what it calls the hard option 
because we are on alert revolutionary justice said we are 
today stronger and better prepared and more determined to hit out 
at strategic interests and deal painful blows 
there was no immediate comment from the white house on the 
latest development 
earlier the bush administration said it was encouraged by 
rafsanjanis comments they certainly are more hopeful than what 
weve heard in the more distant past said white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater 
members of a house panel were taking up a proposed sense of 
congress resolution that the president should designate a 
special envoy to negotiate the release of american hostages in 
lebanon 
the measure was introduced by rep louise slaughter dny who 
said she also hoped to draw attention to the march 16 date marking 
the fifth year of captivity for anderson

journey away 
police said the andresito was carrying 209 crew members and 
passengers who were mostly children some parents and teachers also 
were aboard 
the boat also was loaded with lumber to be used for a new school 
in puritoyacu police said the heavy cargo may have contributed to 
the accident 
the boats helmsman told police that the andresitos motor 
failed and the boat began drifting out of control in the amazons 
fast currents 
in the darkness it smacked into several small boats anchored 
along the shore and then careened into a large freighter rolled 
over and sank into the rivers dark waters police said

requiring all job seekers to show an identity 
card would greatly help enforcement of laws barring the employment 
of illegal aliens the nations chief immigration official said 
wednesday 
gene mcnary who heads the immigration and naturalization 
service told reporters he was not proposing a nationwide identitiy 
card but would consider the concept if it were advanced by others 
i believe it would greatly enhance our ability to enforce 
employer sanctions that prohibit businesses from hiring illegal 
aliens mcnary said 
im not taking the initiative its something that should be 
reviewed and discussed mcnary said i think its up to some 
others its going to take a law passed by congress 
before endorsing the concept id like to have the benefit of 
discussion id like to get the viewpoint of some of the interest 
groups he said 
an identity card would also eliminate the use of fake documents 
by illegal aliens to forge false identities the ins chief said 
under the concept an identity care would be issued to all 
adults seeking work both citizens and aliens with permission from 
ins to hold jobs in this country 
those issued the card would have to show it only to prospective 
employers 
under the 1986 immigration reform and control act employers can 
be fined or prosecuted for employing illegal aliens the provision 
has resulted in complaints that employers have discriminated 
against people they feared were illegal aliens 
studies in california and new york recently blamed the 1986 
laws employer sanctions for discrimination against hispanics and 
members of other ethnic groups who were wrongly suspected of being 
illegal aliens 
the law also bars such discrimination and a justice department 
unit set up in 1987 to handle such cases has received more than 800 
complaints from citizens 
mcnary said he believed the congressional general accounting 
office would discuss the feasibility of issuing a uniform identity 
card in a report it is preparing on the immigration service 
mcnary said he did not know whether the gao would endorse the 
concept which has been discussed by a growing number of lawmakers 
as a way to tighten immigration laws 
many of the discrimination complaints against employers arise 
from confusion about what types of documentation should be required 
for job seekers said andrew strojny the justice departments 
acting special counsel for immigationrelated unfair employment 
practices 
many of the complaints deal with employers not understanding 
what documents are acceptable as proof that a person is a citizen 
or has ins permission to get a job he said 
strojny said that a nationwide identity card would result in 
less discrimination but that personally he feared it would lead 
to a system under which the government would be granting citizens 
permission to work

president bush prodded electronicsindustry 
officials wednesday to do better against foreign trade rivals 
in marketing usdeveloped products such as videocassette 
recorders 
so many of the worlds advanced technologies from robotics to 
the vcr were first developed here and yet so many of these 
concepts were ultimately brought to the marketplace by our 
competitors bush said in a speech to the american electronics 
association 
bush said he was asking the white house council on 
competitiveness chaired by vice president dan quayle to find 
ways that american industry can better translate new ideas and 
technologies into marketable products 
he said he would try to level the playing field by strictly 
enforcing trade laws and pressing other nations to open their 
markets more fully 
but he told his audience it will be leaders like you right 
here in this room that have to take the ball and run with it 
we can do better and i am determined we will do better 
bush proposed no new trade strategies but said congressional 
enactment of many of his lanquishing initiatives would help make 
us hightech goods more competitive 
without passage of his proposed reduction in the capitalgains 
tax rate every business in america of every size is at a 
competitive disadvantage abroad bush said 
among the nations major trade competitors bush said japan has 
a 5 percent capital gains tax and south korea taiwan and west 
germany have none 
capital gains are the income from the sale of stocks real 
estate and other assets it is taxed at the same rate as other 
income up to 33 percent bushs proposal would lower the rate in 
effect to about 195 percent 
bush promised wednesday to work toward helping the us 
electronics industry regain and retain its lost leadership in 
world markets saying he was optimistic that his meeting last 
weekend with japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu would help pry 
open more markets in japan 
he said he and kaifu specifically discussed satellites and 
telecommunications supercomputers forest products and 
semiconductors i hope on the basis of our talks that japan will 
be moving toward early resolution of these problem areas 
there has been a longstanding trade dispute between the united 
states and japan over semiconductors or computer chips that 
resulted in temporary sanctions against japan in 1987 for 
deliberately selling chips in us markets at belowmarket prices

nine western european nations 
agreed wednesday on a plan to clean up the north sea one of the 
worlds most polluted salt water bodies 
the nations agreed to reduce by 70 percent their emissions of 
mercury lead cadmium and dioxin which they described as among 
the most dangerous materials polluting the sea 
the reductions are to be achieved by the end of 1995 said dutch 
transport minister hanja maijweggen chairman of a conference on 
cleaning up the north sea 
levels of 37 other toxic materials would be cut in half by the 
same date and polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs would be phased 
out by 1999 he said 
the 228000squaremile north sea is surrounded by western 
europes most heavily industrialized nations 
pollution from smokestack emissions sea dumping and rivers used 
as industrial sewers have threatened fish and seal populations with 
toxic chemicals 
each year industrial emissions cause some 45 tons of mercury 
3500 tons of lead and 95 tons of cadmium to accumulate into the 
north sea a figure for dioxins was not immediately available 
agreement to limit the materials was a breakthrough for the 
conference as the meeting got underway several nations criticized 
britain which environmental activists here called the dirty man 
of europe 
but maijweggen said that during discussions wednesday britain 
had been very constructive i think that the criticism 
against it has helped a little bit 
in a letter to british environment secretary chris patten 
norway sweden and denmark had expressed dissatisfaction with 
londons announcement this week that it planned to phase out 
industrial waste dumping by late 1992 or early 1993 
we are of the opinion that this should take place without 
further delay the said the letter a copy of which was obtained 
by the associated press 
participating nations at a conference in 1987 in london pledged 
to halt all industrial waste dumping by jan 1 1990 and all north 
sea countries except for britain have met the deadline 
the conference is the third in a series that began in the west 
german port city of bremen in 1984 
the netherlands sweden denmark norway west germany belgium 
france britain and switzerland as well as the european 
commission the eecs executive body are participating ten other 
european nations including east germany and czechoslovakia have 
observer status 
britain announced this week it would end dumping industrial 
waste in two or three years time meantime it would allow annual 
dumpings of 205000270000 tons 
before the conference dutch transport minister hanja 
maijweggen said the british announcement on waste dumping was 
too little and too late 
patten said landbased means of disposal have not yet been 
established for the types of waste that will be dumped in the 
north sea in the coming years 
but critics said the british business world burdened by aging 
industries is balking at the cost of converting to landbased 
waste treatment 
another contentious subject at the conference was marine 
pollution by pcbs believed to be among the most hazardous 
substances manufactured 
annually 39 tons of pcbs find their way into the north sea 
where they are a serious threat to the reproductive cycle of seals 
seal populations in the area are rapidly dwindling 
patten said that contrary to the opinion of the other states 
it is essential to link phaseout with destruction he said 
longterm storage of pcbs is environmentally unacceptable 
west germany is strongly pushing for a total ban on the use of 
pcbs by 1995 under that proposal pcbs now in use for instance 
as coolants in heavyduty electrical equipment should be stored 
until environmentally safe technology has been develop to destroy 
them

a ussoviet treaty to reduce strategic 
weapons would produce annual federal savings ranging from 3 
billion to 12 billion depending on president bushs plans to 
modernize strategic forces said a congressional study released 
wednesday 
the congressional budget office projected longterm savings 
based on the likelihood that an agreement to limit nuclear warheads 
to 6000 on each side will emerge later this year from superpower 
negotiations in geneva 
the treaty would not limit the production of new weapons 
systems and the cbo estimated the savings based on three options 
the bush administration continuing fullscale modernization of its 
strategic forces a less expensive plan to upgrade the systems and 
minimum steps to improve the arsenal 
if the united states signs a treaty and continues current plans 
to buy 132 b2 stealth bombers 500 singlewarhead midgetman 
missiles 23 trident submarines and move 50 multiplewarhead mx 
missiles to railroad cars savings would be about 3 billion 
retirement of b52 bombers minutemen landbased missiles and 
poseidon submarines would have to accompany these actions the cbo 
said 
virtually all of the savings under this option would come from 
reduced operating costs associated with smaller strategic forces 
the cbo said because of the aggressive program of modernization 
assumed under this approach average savings for procurement would 
be modest 
however if the united states adopts a plan calling for 
railgarrison mx missiles 250 midgetman missiles 20 trident 
submarines and 66 b2 stealth bombers savings would total about 8 
billion a year 
a drastic plan to buy no more than the 17 trident submarines and 
15 b2 bombers under contract and no railgarrison mx and 
midgetman missiles would mean savings of about 12 billion a year 
sen pete v domenici rnm who requested the study said the 
report indicates the big savings in defense are not going to come 
out of this part strategic forces of the budget 
the republican senator also stressed the importance of 
continuing modernization 
i dont think it is prudent to abandon our modernization 
efforts at this time and i dont think it would be prudent to do so 
after the conclusion of the start treaty he said

masked palestinians marched through the west 
banks largest market wednesday to protest the easing of an arab 
commercial strike that was announced in a new leaflet from the 
uprising leadership 
arab reports said a suspected collaborator was found hanged near 
his village in the occupied gaza strip and the army said it 
demolished the west bank home of a suspected uprising activist 
soldiers also shot and wounded four palestinians in scattered 
stonethrowing clashes throughout the west bank arab hospital 
officials said the army said it was checking the reports 
the march in the nablus casbah by men from plo chairman yasser 
arafats fatah faction represented a rare show of defiance against 
the uprising leadership which has directed the nearly 27monthold 
revolt through clandestinely produced leaflets 
a leaflet released tuesday said shopkeepers could open their 
stores from 9 am to 2 pm starting saturday shopkeepers have 
been closing their stores since january 1988 at noon in observance 
of a previously ordered strike 
the limited hours which were widely observed were part of a 
display of strength by the uprisings underground leadership 
israeli authorities had first ordered striking shopkeepers to 
open their stores but later gave up when the efforts proved futile 
the marchers shouted through loudspeakers that nablus will be 
excluded from the decision on store hours and that violators would 
be punished 
it was unclear how merchants in nablus the west banks largest 
town with 120000 people would respond 
although some merchants in arab east jerusalem welcomed the 
longer hours as a way to revive depressed businesses others were 
upset with the new directive 
it sends the wrong message to israel said one east 
jerusalem shopkeeper who insisted on anonymity it suggests there 
is no uprising anymore 
there have been other indications the revolt has been losing 
steam 
last month nine palestinians were killed by israeli gunfire 
the lowest monthly casualty toll since the uprising began in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip in december 1987 
at least 659 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
or civilians in the revolt another 193 palestinians have been 
slain by fellow arabs most on suspicion of collaborating with 
israel fortythree israelis have died 
on wednesday arab reports said the body of fahmi zaanin 23 
was found hanging from a tree a night earlier near the gaza village 
of beit hanoun he had been kidnapped from his home saturday by 
masked palestinians they said 
the fate of zaanin is the fate of all collaborators said 
wall slogans signed by the red eagles a group believed affiliated 
with the marxist popular front for the liberation of palestine 
also wednesday soldiers blew up the home of mohammed karoush 
45 of the west bank village of deir balout arab reports said that 
14 people lived in the house 
the army said it took the action against karoushs 25yearold 
son maher who has been wanted since july on charges of throwing 
firebombs at israeli cars damaging property on jewish settlements 
and attacking soldiers and suspected collaborators

angry demonstrators have torn down a 
statue of the nations first communist premier exactly 45 years 
after he took power 
the statue was felled tuesday night after hundreds of 
demonstrators gathered in front of the monument to petru groza and 
without waiting for an official decision took a crane from a 
nearby construction site and ripped the statue down 
thus a more than symbolic act of justice which closed a 
nefarious chapter in our national history was closed a chapter 
based on lies and political pressure the daily romania libera 
said 
the demolition took place a day after work crews lifted the 
statue of vladimir i lenin from its foundation after two days of 
intensive work 
the demonstration began earlier tuesday when 300 people gathered 
in front of the institute of medicine to demand the removal of the 
statue of groza 
demonstrators placed an inverted tin washbasin over grozas head 
and a broom stick in his hand and a swatch of red cloth 
representing communism they then placed a placard at the base of 
the statue saying you are staying here far too long arent you 
tired get down 
the protesters also carried posters reading petru groza the 
faker of the elections in 1946 and groza the founder of the 
romanian gulag 
the demonstrators them went to a nearby building site took a 
crane and quickly tore the statue down 
the demolition of lenin was not as easy and work crews had to 
labor for two full days with jackhammers and blowtorches before 
they were able to dislodge the imposing figure from its marble base 
in front of the recently renamed house of free press 
after 30 years during which the star of communist demagoguery 
looked impassively toward red horizons defying generations of 
romanians who sacrificed their lives in the name of a utopian 
ideal the moment of truth has finally come romania libera 
commented on the removal of the lenin statue 
in the first days of the december revolution that overthrew 
dictator nicolae ceausescu romanians tore the communist emblem out 
of the center of their flag

seven people were killed 
wednesday when police fired on demonstrators in the black homeland 
of bophuthatswana one of several blackruled territories facing 
growing unrest reports said 
south african president fw de klerk said his government was 
concerned the violence in the homelands could hinder efforts to 
open negotiations on a new constitution that would include the 
countrys black majority 
speaking to journalists in cape town de klerk said negotiations 
could not begin if there was anarchy in black areas 
south african foreign minster pik botha said wednesday night his 
governments security forces were providing cooperative 
assistance to bophuthatswana 
he did not say specifically whether troops had been sent to the 
nominally independent homeland but de klerk said that step would 
be taken if necessary 
dozens of blacks have died in recent days during violence in 
several of south africas 10 black homelands most of the deaths 
occurred in the southeastern homeland of ciskei where the military 
staged a coup sunday 
south africa sent troops into ciskei on monday to help quell 
looting and rioting and de klerk said he would take similar action 
in bophuthatswana if necessary 
in nominally independent bophuthatswana police using rifles and 
tear gas battled some 50000 protesters demanding the reintegration 
of the homeland into south africa 
clouds of smoke hung in the air after protesters set fire to 
public buildings and vehicles and looted shops in garankuwa part 
of the homeland 12 miles north of pretoria south africas capital 
the star newspaper of johannesburg quoting witnesses and 
doctors said at least seven people were killed and up to 500 
others suffered various injuries 
protesters called for the resignation of homeland president 
lucas mangope and waved placards denouncing his government 
mangope on wednesday night declared a state of emergency in 
several parts of the homeland which has about 2 million residents 
scattered over seven separate pieces of land 
the independent south africa press association quoted an 
unidentified homeland official as saying that telephone lines in 
and out of bophuthatswana had been cut off for political 
reasons 
south africa established the homelands in the 1960s to try to 
create separate tribalbased states for blacks while whites would 
retain control of national politics and the economy about 14 
million of the countrys 28 million blacks live in the territories 
activists in several of the homelands are demanding 
reintegration into south africa and calling for the end of 
whiteminority rule in south africa four of the homelands are 
nominally independent although no nation but south africa 
recognizes them 
in ciskei south african troops helped restore order wednesday 
after three days of rioting and looting that left at least 27 
people dead and 550 injured 
dissident officers in the ciskei military seized power sunday in 
a bloodless coup but chaos erupted shortly afterward 
ciskei industrialists said the rampage that followed the coup 
had shattered the economy and put 10000 people out of jobs ray 
brentnall head of the ciskei chamber of industries said rioting 
caused damage worth millions of dollars but did not give any 
overall figure 
people are very upset after sweating blood to build up their 
businesses its heartbreaking to see them go up in flames he 
said 
many people in the ciskei were opposed to the goverment of 
ousted president lennox sebe whose rule they considered oppressive 
and corrupt 
sebe was in hong kong at the time of the coup he was expected 
to arrive in south africa on thursday 
in other homelands 
scattered violence was reported wednesday in kwazulu where 
supporters of homeland leader mangosutho buthelezi have waged a 
4yearold power struggle against groups aligned with the african 
national congress guerrilla movement buthelezi met with de klerk 
on wednesday for talks on the violence in the southeastern region 
government offices schools businesses and shops remained 
closed in the northeastern homeland of gazankulu as part of a 
threeweekold protest led by activists demanding the ouster of 
chief minister hudson ntsanwisi

consumer credit than they retired in january as they flocked to 
auto dealerships to lock in on newly reinstated sales incentives

drop and the fourth consecutive monthly decline 
mobile home debt in december was revised wedensday to a 09 
percent decrease from the previously reported 19 percent increase

the united states and the soviet union plan 
sharp increases in air service between the two nations ending 
cutbacks that began with the 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan a 
state department official said wednesday 
the official said that under a tentative agreement reached in 
london last week us airlines would increase scheduled service to 
moscow and leningrad and gain new rights to serve six additional 
soviet cities including two in the soviet far east 
these cities include kiev the capital of the ukraine riga the 
capital of latvia minsk the capital of byelorussia tbilsi the 
capital of soviet georgia and magadan and khabarovsk in the soviet 
far east 
confirming the tentative agreement state department spokeswoman 
anita stockman said soviet airliners would be permitted to increase 
transatlantic service to new york city and washington and would 
gain new rights to serve chicago and miami with onward service to 
two undisclosed points in south america 
soviet air service over the pacific also would begin to 
anchorage alaska and to san francisco with a mandatory stop in 
anchorage the department said 
additionally both nations would be allowed up to 100 charter 
flights a year over the atlantic 
positive consideration also would be given to additional charter 
flights between the united states and the soviet union over the 
pacific she said 
airlines of both nations would also have the right to increase 
the number of weekly flights and to increase the number of airlines 
designated to serve the expanded routes 
stockman said the agreement in principle was reached at a second 
round of negotiations held in london last week to consider 
expanding the civil air transport agreement between the two nations

its service to washington citing soviet repression in poland that 
halted all soviet air service to the united states except for 
aeroflot flights carrying diplomatic personnel and goods intended 
for soviet embassies and consulates 
aeroflots offices in new york and washington were ordered 
closed after the soviets shot down a korean passenger liner over 
the soviet union in 1983 
commercial flights between the two nations were resumed in april 
1986 with regularly scheduled aeroflot flights landing here and pan 
american airways flights landing in moscow 
the next year the two nations signed an agreement permitting the 
expansion of air service beginning in may 1988

two participants in the legal fight to 
open the files of a defunct state segregation agency want a federal 
appeals court to order the records edited to protect the privacy of 
people listed in the files 
john salter jr of grand forks nd and the rev edwin king of 
jackson made thet request in a brief filed in the 5th us circuit 
court of appeals in new orleans 
they contend peoples reputations would be unnecessarily damaged 
if the records of the defunct mississippi sovereignty commission 
are opened without editing 
the unrestricted release of the documents will destroy privacy 
rights of hundreds of citizens and will severely aggravate the 
harm already suffered as a result of the commissions illegal 
spying and disruptive activities they said in the brief filed 
recently by new york city attorney david goldstein 
salter is a former tougaloo college professor and king was 
chaplain there during the 1960s the commission spied on both men 
who were heavily involved in the civil rights struggle 
the commission was established in 1956 to fight integration 
gov bill waller vetoed funding for the agency in 1973 and the 
1977 legislature sealed the files until 2027 citing the need to 
protect the privacy of people named in the documents 
us district judge william h barbour jr on july 27 ordered 
the agencys files unsealed but delayed opening them pending the 
appeal by king and salter who were among the plaintiffs who sued 
to open the files 
king and salters appeal seeks to keep private the names of 
victims and of those who unknowingly aided the commission 
plaintiffs who are seeking to open the files maintain however 
that the effort is a subterfuge to protect certain unidentified 
people 
king and salter oppose the release of information they describe 
as private saying the commission made claims of homosexuality 
drug use or communist affiliations against civil rights activists 
in his ruling barbour said victims of commission skulduggery 
could read the records before they were opened and supply any 
desired response or rebuttal which would be made part of the 
permanent files 
the judge has made it clear he believes state law as it exists 
protects those privacy rights and we find that reasonable said 
ken lawrence one of the plaintiffs we would have accepted more 
restrictions but none of the sort king and salter are suggesting

nadia comaneci apparently upset over 
the breakup of a personal relationship canceled a lecture 
scheduled for wednesday night her agent said 
the speech titled vault into freedom at nassau community 
college on long island was to have been the former olympic 
gymnasts first us appearance on the lecture circuit said mike 
lewis a spokesman for the college 
lewis said comanecis agent bob davis of american program 
bureau in boston called the college wednesday to say she would not 
be attending 
davis told the associated press he has not spoken to comaneci 
since she left for tokyo more than a week ago with constantin 
panait a selfemployed roofer who engineered her escape from 
romania last december 
he said that people in her party have told him that comaneci and 
panait who has a wife and four children in florida had broken up 
on the way back from tokyo 
he said comaneci is staying with friends in montreal the site 
of the 1976 olympics where she won the first perfect scores in 
olympics gymnastics history panait is on the road davis said 
a call to comaneci reached an answering machine 
comaneci said in a recent magazine interview that she and panait 
had no plans to marry she said last month that she intends to 
marry a 30yearold fellow romanian who is expected to enter the 
united states later this year 
she was aware of her speaking engagement but her personal 
life i think has changed davis said 
she was to be paid 7200 for the speech which lewis said would 
not be rescheduled the school had spent about 2400 for 
preparations and publicity but did not plan any legal action 
against comaneci

the government moved closer to changing its 
management of alaskas huge tongass national forest on wednesday 
when a senate committee voted unanimously to modify contracts with 
two timber companies 
the bill approved by senate energy and natural resources 
committee also calls for increased environmental protections but 
does not go as far as the measure already passed by the house 
that bill has tougher environmental provisions and would cancel 
rather than modify the 50year contracts the government has with 
alaska pulp co and louisiana pacificketchikan 
who would have predicted we would end up with a unanimous 190 
vote on such a contentious vote as tongass said sen frank 
murkowski ralaska who has worked to preserve the timber 
industrys position in the forest 
approval of the bill by the full senate would send it to a 
conference committee to work out differences with the house 
version both chambers would then have to vote on the final product 
environmentalists interested in preserving wilderness areas have 
focused on the forest which is bigger than some states 
but people in the five or so cities or communities that base 
their economy on the forests timber dont want the changes said 
some wrangell alaska residents who were on hand for the committee 
action they said changes will cost the region jobs 
the representatives of alaska women in timber said congress was 
reneging on its promise to the two companies and at least one of 
the companies would leave the area if the bill passed 
when you invest so much of your life in an area congress 
shouldnt dictate were going to make some changes so you are 
going to have to move said wilma leslie who operates an 
independent treecutting company with her husband 
but critics charge the companies have monopolized timber and 
violated antitrust and labor laws supporters of the house version 
say canceling the 50year sweetheart deals would open the area to 
competition from other firms 
provisions in the senate bill would 
delete from the law the 40 million appropriation that goes to 
tongass for roadbuilding and other timber sale preparation 
activities 
end the requirement that the forest service provide for sale 
45 billion board feet of tongass timber each decade instead the 
service would be obligated to seek to meet market demand for 
timber 
protect hundreds of thousands more acres of land in the 167 
millionacre forest from logging 
create buffer zones around certain streams to protect fisheries 
the contract modifications would make the deals with the two 
companies conform with independent national forest timber sales and 
strengthen forest service management of the tongass

the state department said wednesday a printing 
error in a recent report caused it to say wrongly that security 
forces in northern ireland killed 39 people in 1989 
actually just two people were kiled by those forces which 
include the regular british army the royal ulster constabulary and 
the ulster defense regiment the department said 
the department stood by its statement in the report that 62 
people were killed in terrorist incidents in northern ireland last 
year 23 of whom were members of the security forces 
the report is a survey of human rights in all countries that the 
state department must submit to congress each year

a judge wednesday refused to dismiss 
charges against joseph hazelwood after the prosecution rested its 
case and the defense offered a new theory on why the former exxon 
valdez skipper should be cleared 
attorney dick madson argued that hazelwood should be acquitted 
of the charge of operating the vessel while intoxicated because he 
technically was not in control of the tanker when it went aground 
march 24 causing the nations worst oil spill 
basing his argument on case law involving drunken driving 
madson said hazelwoods decision to go below and turn over control 
of the bridge to the third mate absolves him from responsibility 
whether he was drunk or sober 
the state is charging captain hazelwood with being intoxicated 
and operating a vessel said madson under the law for driving 
while intoxicated he has to have direct control nowhere at 
all can i find a case that an intoxicated person can be convicted 
of dwi when they do not control the vehicle 
he drew the analogy to a person who is intoxicated gets in a 
cab and tells the driver where to go if the driver runs a red 
light and hits a school bus then the person in the back seat 
giving directions can not be liable 
assistant district attorney brent cole said coast guard 
regulations clearly require the captain to be sober no matter 
where he is on the ship but the judge noted that coast guard 
regulations do not apply in the trial because hazelwood is charged 
under state law not federal 
still superior court judge karl johnstone refused to drop the 
charge saying reasonable minds can differ on the allegations 
he also declined to dismiss the felony charge of criminal 
mischief and two other misdemeanors reckless endangerment and 
negligent discharge of oil 
johnstone also said he believes the exxon valdez was immovably 
grounded once it hit bligh reef and could not have been driven off 
the reef even if hazelwood tried 
but he said the question remained open whether he will instruct 
the jury to disregard the skippers efforts when they consider the 
charges 
hazelwoods defense opened with testimony from a valdez flower 
shop owner who said the master bought flowers to be sent to his 
hometown of huntington ny on march 23 before he sailed 
emily kaiser said she remembered hazelwood clearly because she 
also is from huntington and they talked at length about their 
hometown she said he entered the shop between 2 pm and 3 pm 
and put the purchase on a credit card which was recorded at 202 
pm 
she said he showed no signs of intoxication he was sober 
the prosecution rested its case after madson tried to poke holes 
in an experts testimony that hazelwood was drunk while in command 
of the oilladen ship 
richard prouty acknowledged his method of calculating backwards 
to determine someones prior level of intoxication is a subject of 
dispute among experts he also said his results would have been 
different had he different facts about hazelwoods liquor 
consumption before the captain boarded the tanker 
prouty said he was told by prosecutors that hazelwood drank five 
shots of 100proof vodka in a period of seven hours before boarding 
the ship the night it ran aground 
prouty the chief forensic toxicologist with the oklahoma 
medical examiners office was the states 45th and final witness 
in 4 weeks of testimony 
prouty said he used a combination of figures to calculate 
backwards from blood and urine tests done on hazelwood 10 hours 
after the grounding 
he said hazelwoods blood alcohol level would have been 014 
percent at 1205 am when the tanker ran aground in prince william 
sound 
the legal limit in alaska for driving a car is 010 percent the 
coast guard has a limit of 004 for operating a commercial vessel 
evidence on whether hazelwood was drunk has been inconclusive 
but the issue remains a key factor in the prosecutions effort to 
prove he was reckless 
hazelwood 43 could get up to 7 years in prison and 61000 in 
fines if convicted on all counts

withdrawals from savings institutions 
accelerated in december bringing outflows for all of 1989 to a 
record 736 billion the government said wednesday 
the industry lost 86 billion in deposits excluding interest 
credited in december the office of thrift supervision said that 
was the biggest onemonth drain since a 88 billion outflow in 
september and the 18th in 19 months withdrawals totaled 48 
billion in november and 63 billion in october 
outflows for the full year were the largest on record the last 
big outflow 254 billion occurred in 1981 when interest rates 
for competing moneymarket mutual funds skyrocketed above 20 
percent at a time when thrift rates were capped by law 
total deposits with interest credited declined 16 billion in 
1989 to 946 billion 
what youre seeing now is unprecedented but its not 
surprising said economist martin regalia of the national council 
of savings institutions 
early in the year the industry lost deposits in part because 
sampl problems had shaken customers confidence but economists say 
the shrinkage in the last half of the year is almost entirely a 
response to tough financial standards in the sampl bailout 
legislation enacted in august 
the rules require thrifts to back their loans with more of their 
owners money most cant raise the capital and as a result must 
trim their balance sheets 
thrifts shed 256 billion in assets in december with 46 
billion of that coming at sampls under government control and almost 
threefourths of the remainder at weakly capitalized thrifts still 
operating independently 
sampl assets at the end of the year totaled 125 trillion down 
100 billion or 73 percent from a year earlier in contrast 
commercial bank assets grew 54 percent to 33 trillion 
i think the sampl downsizing is going to continue throughout 
1990 and maybe into 1991 as well although we might see some ebbing 
of the pace regalia said

three doctors stood on a train rail and 
reached up into twisted metal trying to save a womans life by 
amputating her leg 
a female doctor one of the first to arrive at the deadly subway 
accident wednesday morning had to borrow a paramedics buck knife 
to amputate the leg of a dead man to free a survior caught 
underneath 
the accident on the southeastern pennsylvania transportation 
authority subway line sent 20 paramedics and 10 doctors rushing 
underground 
the doctors discovered that all the rescue equipment in the 
world was useless in some cases 
a team of surgeons robert dalsey and rick smith of the medical 
college of pennsylvania and thomas jefferson universitys murray 
cohen amputated an unidentified womans right leg when rescue 
workers could not free her 
ive never seen anything quite like this said dalsey all 
equipment that you could possibly want was there but it was less 
than ideal conditions there was no obvious way to free her 
dalsey said the woman was going into shock unable to 
communicate with the physicians she died later at hahnemann 
hospital one of three dead and more than 160 injured in the 
derailment 
smith said that working in the tunnel was a unique experience he 
did not want to repeat 
as an orthopedic surgeon im used to seeing injuries in a 
hospital not in the field he said 
the tranist agency shut down all power to the tunnel to prevent 
electrocutions leaving medical crews with only portable light use 
of emergency oxygen was out of the question the threat of fire 
was too great 
dr jina joder an emergency physician at the medical college 
was one of the first physicians to arrive 
it was dark when i first got there the medics already there 
had begun ivs using flashlights to see and then the fire crew 
set up generators and floodlights light was probably the biggest 
problem she said 
she said she had to use a paramedicss buck knife to amputate 
the leg of a dead man to free a man caught underneath him 
her hospital contracts with the city to train to the fire 
departments paramedics and provides physicians to direct 
paramedics in the field according to hospital trauma program 
coordinator cindy blank 
jefferson dispatched a fourperson surgical team the jeff 
state team to the crash site to work with five surgeons and 
three emergency medicine fellows from the medical college 
according to hospital spokeswoman betsy samuels 
at the emergency room of the hospital of the university of 
pennsylvania a team of more than 100 physicians and more than 50 
nurses treated more than 40 patients according to dr sheldon 
jacobson director of emergency medicine 
more than four hours after the accident jacobson said the 
emergency room was finally almost back to normal

moslems blew up a truck carrying security 
forces wednesday killing three soldiers in the few hours the 
government relaxed a curfew designed to stop the kashmiri 
separatist uprising officials said 
in separate incidents militants shot and killed a moslem they 
said was a police informer and a moslem died after he was caught in 
an exchange of fire between militants and security forces 
officials said 
also wednesday moslem snipers fired on security forces in three 
parts of srinagar during a fivehour relaxation of curfew said 
gov jagmohan of jammukashmir state there were no casualties he 
said 
the curfew was relaxed from 5 am to 10 am to allow people in 
the city of 1 million to shop for food and other essentials 
an aroundtheclock curfew was imposed friday after security 
forces the day before shot and killed 49 moslem demonstrators 
marching into srinagar to take part in a proindependence rally at 
least 1 million moslems demonstrated to demand independence for the 
predominantly moslem state india is predominantly hindu 
srinagar the summer capital of jammukashmir is the center of 
the separatist movement 
at least 171 people have been killed in kashmir since a 
government crackdown on the separatist movement began on jan 20 
leading national parties decided wednesday to send a 
highpowered delegation to srinagar according to the press 
trust of india news agency it did not name the members but it 
said they would go thursday 
the decision was taken at the end of a daylong multiparty 
meeting on kashmir called by prime minister vp singh a joint 
statement after the meeting said despite their ideological and 
political differences the parties were one in defending the 
unity and integrity of the country the news agency reported 
jagmohan said the truck was driving around srinagar distributing 
food to troops on street corners when it was blown up by moslem 
militants he gave no further details of the attack 
the attacks came amid government claims that security forces 
arrested at least 12 leaders of the moslem group hezbul mujahedeen 
jagmohan said the militants from srinagar and the border towns of 
baramulla and kupwara have been arrested since sunday 
hezbul mujahedeen is one of 30 militant groups fighting for 
secession it is believed the second most powerful independence 
group after the jammukashmir liberation front 
we are going to hit hard at antinational elements there is 
no way they can get away with what they are doing jagmohan said 
it may take a month six months maybe a year but ultimately 
these antinational elments are going to be neutralized 
jagmohan a hindu was appointed the state governor of 
jammukashmir on jan 18 in an attempt by the government to control 
the unrest 
kashmir has been a problem for more than four decades following 
the 1947 partition of british colonial india into predominantly 
moslem pakistan and the mostly hindu india 
jammukashmir then a princely state chose to merge with india 
pakistan protested claiming the territory because of its 
predominantly moslem population 
the two countries have twice gone to war over the territory 
the kashmir portion of jammukashmir is mostly moslem while the 
southern jammu segment is predominantly hindu overall about 65 
percent of the states 6 million people are moslem 
nationwide moslems make up 12 percent of indias 880 million 
people and hindus account for 82 percent

a senior education official said 
wednesday that china may extend to other institutions a program in 
which beijing university students were sent to a military academy 
to build discipline 
the universitys freshman class of about 800 students was sent 
to an academy in hebei south of the capital for training that the 
official press said included firing guns and throwing grenades 
beijing university played a major role last spring in the 
studentled prodemocracy movement which was crushed by the 
military and the school was singled out by the government as it 
acted to prevent a repeat of the movement 
on wednesday teng teng vice chairman of the state education 
commission said of the military training program if the 
experiment works out we can apply it to other institutions 
teng spoke with reporters at jomtien near bangkok where he was 
attending an international conference on education 
he said that besides receiving military training the beijing 
university students who participated also worked in factories and 
on farms the aim was to bring students into contact with soldiers 
workers and farmers to let them know what the realities are 
teng said 
he said the program has had mixed results 
some of the effect is sound and some not so favorable teng 
said without elaborating 
but he added it has greatly enhanced discipline among 
students 
teng said sending chinese students to study in europe and japan 
had worked out fairly well but he complained that north america 
kept the students instead of their returning to work in china to 
repay its investment in them 
teng said students should be free to express whatever political 
views they hold but should not resort to radicalism 
democracy can only be pursued on a gradual basis he said 
if education works well it can promote democracy but if we 
overstress the role of democracy it can give rise to riots and 
chaos 
he said china wanted to improve its grade school system and 
provide nine years of education for people in the coastal provinces 
and at least six years for those in remoter inland areas 
china also wants to place more emphasis on scientific and 
technical teaching in colleges he said

inflation speeded up in the united states and 
other major industrial countries in 1989 for the third year in a 
row the international monetary fund reported wednesday 
prices paid by consumers in the seven industrial countries rose 
an average of 44 percent compared with 34 percent in 1988 3 
percent in 1987 and 24 percent in 1986 
the fund calculated prices in the united states increased their 
rise from 19 percent in 1986 to 48 percent last year 
the fund said last years overall increase last year was 
relatively moderate compared with the average annual increase of 
about 79 percent registered during the period 197085 
britain showed the biggest rise to 78 percent from 34 
percent three years earlier according to the report in the funds 
monthly imf memorandum 
the increase was also high in italy although complete figures 
were not in by last august italy was showing a 63 percent annual 
inflation rate compared with 51 percent for 1988 
japan which had only a 06 percent inflation rate in 1986 
showed the smallest increase in 1989 at 23 percent west germany

percent far more than the annual rate of 824 percent in 1986 
prices in developing nations in the western hemisphere have 
risen 11677 percent since 1985 the fund said

accounts for a third of latin americas economy prices paid by 
brazilians rose 1287 percent in 1989 after inflation of 682 
percent in 1988 
argentinas inflation was even faster reaching an annual rate 
of 3967 percent last august 
developing countries in asia were much more successful in 
holding down prices south korean prices rose 57 percent last 
year less than the year before most asian countries appeared able 
to keep inflation in single digits though the fund had no figure 
to show what happened after china reported 207 percent in 1988

president bush issued a proclamation wednesday 
asking everybody who lives in the united states to truthfully 
answer all questions on the 1990 census 
the census bureau is mailing out questionnaires march 23 to all 
american households in its decennial headcounting exercise 
bush quoted abraham lincoln as saying if we could just know 
where we are and whither we are tending we could better judge what 
to do and how to do it 
the census helps to provide us with such insight said bush 
the census bureau has enlisted 425000 workers to ring 
doorbells canvass householders and even tally the homeless on 
bigcity streets the forms by law must be filled out and returned 
by april 1 the official census day 
the us population has just passed the 250 million mark 
according to the latest census estimate 
there were only 39 million americans in 1790 when us marshals 
carried out the first census under the direction of thensecretary 
of state thomas jefferson bush noted this will be the 21st census 
each decennial census has helped to chart the growth and 
change experienced by our vast country during the past 200 years 
said bush 
the primary purpose today as in 1790 is to fix the state 
population totals that determine the number of seats each state 
gets in the house of representatives 
bush said it also now serves to help reshape voting districts 
for state and local governments and plays an essential role in 
allocating billions of dollars for education health care crime 
prevention transportation and other purposes 
the information will help the government and private sector make 
critical decisions as we prepare to enter the 21st century 
bush said 
it is the responsibility and obligation of every person who 
usually resides in the united states to take part in the 1990 
census of population and housing by truthfully answering all 
questions on the census forms applying to him or her and to each 
member of the household to which he or she belongs the president 
proclaimed 
bush also assured the skittish the census results wont be 
released in any way that will identify or harm any person or 
household 
that means they cannot be used for taxcollection purposes by 
immigration authorities for jury service or similar intrusive 
purposes 
the census is expected to cost 25 billion a figure driven up 
in part by an expected drop in the number of americans who respond 
by mail fewer mail responses means the census bureau has to do 
more work to contact people 
commerce secretary robert a mosbacher said the us 
taxpayers can save 10 million for every 1 percent of the 
population that responds by mail nearly 81 percent responded by 
mail to the 1970 census and 75 percent in 1980 census officials 
fear only 70 percent will respond by mail this time

a senior western aid official wednesday 
welcomed the governments decision to establish a neutral camp for 
more than 275000 cambodian refugees now under control of three 
guerrilla groups 
the guerrillarun camps will be closed and the refugees sent to 
the neutral grounds in preparation for their return home when the 
11yearold war in cambodia ends 
the deputy government spokesman likhit hongladarom said the 
cabinet made the decision at its weekly session tuesday 
the united nations border relief operation and the un high 
commissioner for refugees which aid the camps along thailands 
eastern border with cambodia have long favored establishing a 
neutral camp 
an unaffiliated camp would protect the refugees from being 
forcibly repatriated by the guerrillas or pressured to go to 
certain areas of their homeland 
we welcome the idea of starting the preparations for 
repatriation said the senior aid official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
but he warned that guerrilla leaders may respond by quickening 
their own repatriation of the refugees without un supervision 
aid officials say thousands of civilians under khmer rouge 
guerrilla control have been moved out of the refugee camps in 
recent months and resettled in strategic areas 
the refugee camps were established shortly after vietnam invaded 
cambodia in late 1978 and ousted the brutal khmer rouge regime 
sending hundreds of thousands of people fleeing to the thai border 
the three guerrilla groups the khmer rouge the khmer peoples 
national liberation front and the forces of prince norodom sihanouk 
have used the camps for military recruitment and to back their 
claims to have a popular following 
in briefing reporters on the cabinet meeting likhit said 
tuesday that a neutral camp was needed because the refugees have 
caused numerous problems for thailand particularly with security 
the thai government is not happy with the situation and has 
therefore decided to close all refugee centers and to replace them 
with a neutral camp which is to be set up with united nations 
cooperation in the form of an assistance budget to feed the 
refugees he said 
he said the foreign ministry has been instructed to contact the 
vietnameseinstalled government in phnom penh cambodias capital 
and urge it to take back the refugees 
likhit also said tuesday that prime minister chatichai 
choonhavan will also ask other nations to stop supplying the 
cambodian factions with weapons

the reagan administrations top specialist on 
afghanistan said wednesday that the united states has become 
entangled in internal afghan politics and that it must stop arming 
the mujahedeen rebels 
robert peck the state departments chief analyst on afghanistan 
until last june testified before two house subcommittees debating 
the advisability of continued military support for the rebels 
what disturbs me most about the american role in all this is 
the degree to which the united states has become involved in what 
are essentially internal afghan affairs peck said 
however assistant secretary of state john kelly said the united 
states was determined to keep supporting the mujahedeen until 
sovietinstalled president najib is removed 
despite bush administration predictions that the rebels would 
defeat najib once the soviets pulled out of afghanistan in february 
1989 the sides have been locked in a military stalemate 
state department officials are examining the direction of us 
policy in light of the stalemate but the administration is under 
strong pressure from many in congress to maintain the aid program 
for the rebels 
kelly rejected suggestions from rep stephen solarz dny 
that the united states and soviet union negotiate a mutual halt to 
arming the warring sides 
najib enjoys an advantage over the mujahedeen in terms of 
arsenals provided by the soviet union more than 300 million a 
month and a cutoff of weapons would give him an unfair advantage 
kelly said 
the united states provides the mujahedeen weapons including 
antiaircraft stinger missiles through pakistan the program is 
covert and reportedly costs 300 million to 400 million a year 
saudi arabia and several other countries also give money 
the united states kelly said also is pushing for a political 
settlement that would include convening a summer leadership council 
of all opposition elements from afghanistan 
representatives of the council would negotiate with residents of 
afghan cities controlled by najibs forces about forming a new 
government through elections kelly said the united states is 
determined to exclude najib from the process and believes the 
soviets can persuade him to step down kelly said 
peck said that the main us task is to negotiate with the 
soviets an end to foreign arms supplies but in such a way that 
would deny najib an unfair advantage 
kelly said the united states does not have much information 
about this weeks coup attempt against najib launched by renegade 
military officers in part because us embassy personnel were 
withdrawn from kabul last year 
he said the united states did not have advance word about the 
attempted coup

the navy plans no reductions in the trident 
nuclear submarine program despite the warming of eastwest 
relations the navys top submarine officer told a congressional 
panel wednesday 
vice adm daniel l cooper told the house seapower subcommittee 
that the navy plans to build a total of 24 submarines at a rate of 
one per year 
has the soviet threat really changed cooper asked as 
we look at the navy we see no change he answered 
cooper the assistant chief of naval operations for undersea 
warfare said the trident program the only leg of the nations 
nuclear triad of bombers missiles and submarines that has been 
modernized 
cooper also said that with improvements in submarine 
communications nuclear submarines will be able to shoulder a 
larger share of the nations strategic defense burden 
coopers remarks were the first public affirmation since 
president bush submitted his budget in january that the navy is 
sticking to its plan of building one trident per year at a cost of 
about 12 billion each navy sources had said prior to the budget 
announcement that the trident program might be cut back to one 
every other year 
but slowing down trident production cooper said would have a 
very great impact one i think the cost of of a trident submarine 
would go up 10 to 15 percent i strongly recommend that we 
continue buying one a year

jacqueline onassis agreed wednesday to 
give a group of wampanoag indians a plot of land and 100000 in 
exchange for a tiny beachfront site ending an acrimonious 10year 
dispute over the property 
the case pitted mrs onassis desire for privacy against the 
indians belief that they should retain tribal lands on marthas 
vineyard 
after all this time im just happy the land was settled 
said selma weissberg one of the 25 descendants of william 
vanderhoop a wampanoag who lived in the area in the 1870s and 
owned the 15acre plot ive lived on the island all my life and 
im happy that we have some of our land back 
the agreement was ratified by judge john s macdougall jr in 
dukes county probate court 
at issue was a 15acre section of land surrounded by onassis 
estate but owned primarily by the wampanoags a tribe that has 
lived at the picturesque cliffs of gay head for centuries 
the tribe considers the land sacred the wampanoags believe the 
tract is the last resting place of the great chief moshup and his 
wife squant tribal lore holds it was there that moshup threw his 
children into the sea when he foresaw the coming of the white man 
the new plot of land is about two acres with a 250foot ocean 
frontage at zacks cliff in gay head 
in 1980 mrs onassis obtained onesixth interest in the 
15acre plot and sought to buy the remaining fivesixths from the 
25 descendants of vanderhoop she wanted to close access to the 
parcel and keep beachgoers and tourists away from her 400acre 
property 
but the wampanoags resisted and a series of lawsuits and 
countersuits followed 
according to the terms of the agreement signed wednesday the 
wampanoags will surrender title and access to the 15acre site in 
exchange for 100000 and the larger section of beachfront 1500 
feet closer to the nearest road mrs onassis also will pay all 
costs related to the land transfer and the indians agreed to drop 
all suits pending in the matter 
this way everybody wins said attorney paul sulla who 
represented the wampanoags until now theyve always been asked 
to move from their land and given money now theyve gotten some 
land in exchange 
brian hurley one of mrs onassis attorneys said shes just 
pleased to have resolved this long matter and hopes to continue 
being good neighbors she wants to put it behind her 
since 1974 various wampanoags have regained about 400 acres of 
what they consider tribal land on marthas vineyard through a 
series of federal lawsuits 
they claimed that the 1790 indian nonintercourse act which 
forbids transfer of indian lands without federal approval was 
violated in the 1870s when the state redistributed tribal lands to 
other island residents 
the wampanoags have maintained a tribal structure for more than 
370 years according to tribal council president donald widdiss 
but they did not receive federal recognition until 1987 there are 
only 250 wampanoags left at gay head and only 630 total in the 
nation

ministers of the leftleaning labor party on 
wednesday extended an ultimatum for quitting the coalition 
government giving prime minister yitzhak shamirs likud bloc four 
more days to approve us peace proposals 
about 2500 rightwing demonstrators and jewish settlers by 
police estimate gathered in downtown jerusalem wednesday 
demanding that shamir reject the proposals for israelipalestinian 
talks put forward by us secretary of state james a baker iii 
they held signs saying israel is not for sale and people 
of the bible are returning to the land of the bible 
youths wearing knitted skullcaps danced in circles a donkey 
carrying an effigy of baker stood nearby 
the crowd included settlers from the occupied west bank and 
members of such rightwing and nationalist parties as tehiya 
moledet and tzomet 
thwarted in their plans to march to shamirs residence some 
gathered instead at the us consulate others walked the streets 
with burning torches 
labor ministers announced the extension after the inner cabinet 
failed to decide on the us proposals in a twohour meeting and 
postponed a vote until sunday 
if bakers proposals are not approved then labors central 
committee will meet monday with a recommendation that the party 
quit toppling the 15monthold government labor officials said 
if shamir uses some delay trick sunday we will view it as a 
negative answer and respond as we have decided labor legislator 
chaim ramon warned 
energy minister moshe shahal of labor predicted shamirs cabinet 
would fall saying i dont think there is any possibility of 
getting likud to change their minds 
however the extra time gives shamir breathing room to negotiate 
a compromise with labors leader vice premier shimon peres 
in an israel television interview peres said wednesdays 
extension was the last he was willing to grant shamir 
i think we have reached the end he asked for two more days 
fine i would not break the government apart over that but if the 
prime minister thinks he can prolong it on sunday too that is a 
mistake peres said 
i think the countdown has started and likud ministers have 
decided to put an end to the coalition government 
peres said labor may form a narrow government go to 
opposition or to new elections im not promising anything 
some labor leaders are hesitant about withdrawing from the 
government notably defense minister yitzhak rabin labors no 2 
man 
maybe till sunday reason would prevail in each camp rabin 
said during a tour of northern israel 
labors cabinet minister mordechai gur expressed the same hope 
i dare to say that reason will indeed prevail and we will be 
able to find a common formula he said on israel army radio 
at wednesdays cabinet session labor and likud leaders argued 
heatedly over bakers proposals that call on israel to agree to 
including east jerusalem arabs and palestinians deported by israel 
in preliminary peace talks planned for cairo 
the suggestions are a compromise with palestinian demands for 
direct plo involvement in the talks which israel strongly opposes 
shamir opened the cabinet meeting by reporting on a telephone 
call from baker on march 1 what about the decision of the 
israeli government shamir quoted baker as asking according to 
israel radio 
the issue is serious we still have to think shamir said he 
replied 
foreign minister moshe arens of likud said baker also refused to 
back fully the israeli withdrawal from cairo talks if palestinian 
negotiators announce they represent the palestine liberation 
organization israel army radio reported 
you will have to trust us arens said baker told him at last 
months talks in washington to which arens replied we cannot 
trust you in the issue of plo 
according to shahal peres read out bakers proposals and 
demanded a vote likud leaders balked and shamir said they would 
continue discussions sunday and then vote shahal added 
the radio said the focus of debate was on involving 140000 east 
jerusalem arabs in the israeli elections plan for the occupied 
lands seen as part of an interim settlement of selfrule for 
palestinians 
the elections are expected to be the focus of the planned cairo 
talks 
if east jerusalem arabs participate in the vote is it not 
tantamount to our agreeing to the division of jerusalem arens 
said in the meeting according to israel radio 
peres reportedly responded by chiding arens so you agree to 
let arabs in nablus the west banks largest town into the 
delegation does that mean you are ready to give up nablus this 
already is progress 
hardliners in likud fear allowing east jerusalem arabs to vote 
will raise questions about israels annexation of the sector after 
it was captured in the 1967 middle east war 
at least 659 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
or civilians in the 27monthold palestinian uprising in the 
occupied lands and 43 israelis have died

the governments plea bargain agreement with 
the northrop corp on alleged violations of defense contracting 
procedures is utterly inexcusable two congressmen said 
wednesday 
reps christopher shays rconn and peter smith rvt called 
on the house government operations subcommittee on legislation and 
national security to hold hearings on northrops agreement 
we think this kind of activity on the part of our prosecutors 
and court system let alone the government is utterly inexcusable 
and indicates the potential for collusion shays and smith said 
in a letter 
northrop pleaded guilty last month to 34 federal counts related 
to falsified testing of parts for the av8b harrier jet and cruise 
missile components and agreed to a 17 million fine 
in the plea bargain the defense contractor entered guilty pleas 
through attorney richard sauber to making false statements to the 
government 
the two congressmen said whistleblowers have alleged as much as 
20 billion was lost or stolen during the classified phase of the 
b2 stealth bomber program northrop manufactures the radarevading 
plane 
northrop as you also know has a long and some say one of the 
worst records with regard to compliance with federal regulations 
when it comes to procurement and acquisition shays and smith 
said 
on feb 27 the day of the agreement the los angelesbased 
northrop issued a statement saying 
the us government and northrop corporation reached a complex 
compromise today under which the government agreed to withdraw 
various charges the company had been contesting for over a year 
and northrop in turn agreed to pay a 17 million fine for charges 
arising out of actions by some employees it subsequently fired in 
1987 from its now closed western services department

was also protesting efforts led by sen patrick leahy dvt to 
cut sharply the 500 million in panamanian aid requested by 
president bush 
for a few days in september endara then a leading opposition 
member also staged a hunger strike at that time he was 
protesting police brutality under noriega whom he replaced with

black nationalist leader nelson 
mandela thanked tanzania on wednesday for helping his african 
national congress in its fight against south africas white 
government 
more than 40000 people gathered in a stadium to honor the anc 
deputy president who last month was freed after 27 years in prison 
in south africa mandela arrived from harare zimbabwe on tuesday 
thousands of exiled anc members live in tanzania and most are to 
return home by the end of the year the pretoria government 
recently legalized the anc and other antiapartheid groups 
legitimizing them for the first time in 30 years 
mandela told the rally in dar es salaam the anc had asked 
tanzanias ruling party for help with grassroots organizing he 
noted the partys organizational strength through committees and 
political leaders in each of the east african nations 
neighborhoods and villages 
we are hopeful our request will be met mandela said 
indicating he hoped the anc could build a similar organization in 
south africa 
on the second of his six days in tanzania mandela also thanked 
former president julius nyerere for helping the anc and other 
movements 
he referred to the front for the liberation of mozambique the 
zimbabwe national union and zimbabwe african peoples national 
union namibias southwest africa peoples organization and the 
popular movement for the liberation of angola 
all of the groups operated from tanzania at one time or another 
mandela said the first anc guerrillas to take up the armed 
struggle for black majority rule in south africa were trained in 
tanzania nearly 30 years ago and their camps remain in the country 
he said tanzania again opened its doors when the anc was 
forced to evacuate its fighters from angola following a 
usbrokered agreement between south africa angola and cuba that 
called for namibias independence the south african territory is 
scheduled to become independent on march 21 
tanzania has never publicly acknowledged the existence of the 
guerrilla camps saying only that south african refugees were in 
its territory 
on thursday mandela was to fly to the semiautonomous island of 
zanzibar then return to the mainland town of iringa where western 
diplomats say there are between 3000 and 4000 anc guerrillas in 
five secret camps 
the rally at the national stadium began with prime minister 
joseph warioba bestowing on mandela the order of the torch of 
kilimanjaro 2nd class the medal is named after africas highest 
peak which rises to a height of 19200 feet in northern tanzania 
the only other foreigner to receive the honor was the late 
mozambique president samora machel who waged a guerrilla war 
against the portuguese colonists in his homeland from southern 
tanzania 
earlier local authorities in dar es salaam made mandela an 
honorary citizen of the city and renamed one of its major 
thoroughfares nelson mandela expressway

a buildup of methane gas emerged 
wednesday as the suspected cause of an explosion that leveled a 
bank killing three employees and injuring 14 other people 
authorities said 
preliminary autopsy results released earlier wednesday 
discounted a bomb as the cause of the explosion tuesday at the 
crested butte state bank in this rocky mountain ski resort town 
seven people remained hospitalized in grand junction and 
gunnison three in serious condition 
montrose pathologist dr mike benzinger said he discounted a 
bomb as a cause after examining preliminary results of autopsies on 
the three dead women 
there were no marks on the victims bodies to indicate 
explosives were involved benzinger said 
the blast which occurred as the bank was opening for business 
leveled the twostory brick building reducing everything except 
the vault to rubble 
the victims were identified as donna smith 33 jade woelk and 
monica henning all of crested butte the ages of the other victims 
were not available 
state and local investigators would not speculate further on the 
cause of the explosion until federal investigators began examining 
the site 
us bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms personnel began 
arriving wednesday 
methane as the cause is my most fervent hope said hank 
smith police chief in mount crested butte well wait for 
confirmation from atf and then well call the mine inspectors 
methane is odorless and colorless detectable only by handheld 
instruments said bill denning an inspector with the us mine 
safety and health administration in denver 
denning said it was possible that coal beds beneath or around 
the town might be producing methane as could an abandoned and 
sealed mine in the vicinity 
methane also is found in landfills because it is the product of 
decomposing organic material denning said 
a spark is needed to ignite methane said denning and there 
would be an abundance of potential spark sources in the bank 
sometimes all it takes is a light switch he said 
workers on wednesday opened a temporary bank next door to the 
explosion site the staff included an injured executive vice 
president and a retired bank employee 
the rest of the town tried to resume normal business operations 
its hard to watch people on vacation when youre in a 
tragedy said hope ostheimer a clerk in an office supply store 
its hard to hear them complain about not getting their checks 
cashed some are real sensitive but others arent and then there 
are the ones who dug through the rubble with all the rest of us 
yesterday trying to find our friends 
i guess im just angry you feel so enraged because you dont 
know what happened yet you just know theyre dead and hurt she

president bushs nominee to the nations top 
civil rights enforcement job came under fire wednesday but a 
democratic senator said it appeared likely john r dunne would be 
confirmed 
im not sure president bush would appoint anybody better than 
you sen howard metzenbau dohio told dunne regardless of 
how i vote youre going to be confirmed 
dunne 60 was tapped in january to be assistant attorney 
general for civil rights the post has been vacant since december 
1988 when william bradford reynolds resigned 
the former new york state senator was questioned wednesday about 
his long membership in two private clubs that barred women and 
about his investments in companies that do business in south africa 
if you had it to do ever again in retrospect do you think 
you might have taken a different course of conduct metzenbaum 
asked in regard to joining the allmale clubs 
i believe i would have dunne replied 
dunne became a member of the long island garden city golf club 
in 1957 quitting when his nomination to the civil rights post 
appeared imminent the second club the fort orange club in albany 
ny began admitting women in 1988 
i think on balance maybe even more than balance youll find 
someone who is sensitive to the needs of women as well as any 
other group that requires protection dunne said 
nominee william c lucas was rejected in august on a 77 
committee vote lucas a black was opposed by many civil rights 
groups because he sided with bush on recent a supreme court ruling 
that expanded opportunities to challenge affirmative action 
policies 
dunne who was a state senator for 24 years has been criticized 
by civil rights groups for having very little civil rights 
experience he is white 
sen paul simon dill who chaired the hearing asked dunne to 
explain his position on apartheid in light of the fact that he and 
his law firm hold stock in companies that do business in south 
africa and that he voted against a measure requiring new york state 
to divest such holdings 
let me put right up in the front i hate if one can hate the 
principle of apartheid dunne replied the three items are 
unconnected and not indicative of an attitude that favors that 
system 
the associated press reported last week that dunne holds almost 
20000 worth of stock in schlumberger ltd a new yorkbased 
company engaged in oil field services and oil products 
manufacturing 
benjamin hooks executive director of the national association 
for the advancement of colored people has said his group would 
neither endorse nor oppose dunne 
simon aide john travesina said the committee would probably vote 
march 22

the american medical association on wednesday 
proposed expanding medicaid and requiring employers to provide 
medical insurance to fulltime employees to help fill the gaps in 
the nations health care system 
the ama also called for the creation of state risk pools to 
provide group insurance policies for those who cannot afford 
coverage under the current system including small businesses and 
the selfemployed and for individuals whose illnesses make them 
medically uninsurable 
the changes are aimed at providing access to health care for all 
americans including the estimated 33 million who have no medical 
insurance regardless of income 
ama officials who unveiled the plan at a news conference 
declined to put a total price on the package but said the medicaid 
expansion would probably cost about 30 billion a year 
an ama source speaking on the condition of anonymity said a 
fair estimate for the whole package was about 60 billion a 
year 
dr alan r nelson ama president did not suggest specifically 
how the plan would be financed but he said almost certainly 
this would require some increased taxes 
james s todd acting executive vice president of the ama said 
talking about the cost of the package would detract from the plan 
itself 
we dont want to see the concept deepsixed because someone 
put a price on it he said we dont think you should make 
health care decisions based on what it will cost but rather on 
what is appropriate and needed 
the ama said the plan corrects weaknesses in the current system 
while building on its strengths including patients freedom to 
choose their healthcare provider 
the individuals freedom of choice remains a cornerstone of 
the american system nelson said though revision of the current 
system is badly needed it would be counterproductive to fix 
aspects of our system that are not broken he said 
the amas proposal is similar to a 66 billion plan recommended 
last week by the us bipartisan commission on comprehensive health 
care known as the pepper commission for its first chairman the 
late rep claude pepper dfla 
the nations healthcare bill is expected to reach 600 billion 
this year more than 11 percent of the gross national product 
the highlights of the ama plan include 
expanding medicaid to all people below the poverty level and 
establishing uniform benefits medicaid now covers fewer than half 
of those living below the poverty line and eligibility and 
benefits vary from state to state 
requiring employers to provide health insurance for all 
fulltime employees and their families and eliminating 
statemandated benefits employers would be allowed tax deductions 
to help with costs 
establishing state risk pools funded with tax revenues or 
insurance company contributions to make coverage available for 
those who cant afford or cant get insurance about 15 states 
currently have such pools 
expanding private sector coverage of longterm care with tax 
incentives 
revising medical malpractice laws to reduce liability insurance 
costs for physicians and the practice of defensive medicine such 
as ordering tests and procedures that otherwise might not be 
ordered 
also wednesday the institute of medicine recommended changes in 
the current monitoring of medicare services to increase emphasis on 
quality of care 
the current system is viewed by nearly all concerned as 
ineffective said kathleen lohr who directed the study for the 
institute which is chartered by the national academy of sciences 
the report recommends a plan that would be phased in over 10 
years to shift the focus of the monitoring program from containing 
costs to tracking and evaluating the care of patients

a jury of seven women and five men was sworn 
in wednesday for the irancontra trial of john poindexter whose 
lawyers were attempting to sharply curtail any damaging testimony 
from oliver north the governments leadoff witness 
the jury was sent home for the day after being selected from a 
pool of 45 people as us district court judge harold greene 
considered the question of whether to limit norths testimony jury 
selection took just three days as opposed to more than a week in 
the north trial last year 
many of the jurors said they had heard of north but knew little 
about poindexter his former boss who many failed to recognize in 
the courtroom 
the jurors include a bridal consultant a university accountant 
a postal worker a retired foodservice worker and a housewife one 
of the six alternate jurors is a retiree who got the watergate 
scandal confused with the irancontra affair 
at a hearing prosecutor john barrett argued that north should 
testify that he saw poindexter destroy a presidential finding on 
iran and that poindexter forced north to lie about the contras to 
congress 
poindexter lawyer stephen mcnabb said north testimony on those 
two subjects should not be permitted because it was based on 
earlier testimony poindexter gave congress in 1987 under a grant of 
immunity from prosecution 
at his trial last year north testified that he witnessed 
poindexter destroy thenpresident reagans finding which depicted 
the iran initiative as a straight armsforhostages deal north 
recently said his knowledge of the destruction was based on 
poindexters immunized testimony 
but north is a witness who doesnt want to testify for the 
government barrett said suggesting norths was merely trying to 
avoid harming his former boss 
regarding the contras barrett said that norths and 
poindexters stories contradict each other about a crucial aug 6 
1986 meeting with congressmen at the white house at that meeting 
north falsely denied assisting the contras militarily 
poindexter has testified to congress that north assured him he 
could handle the meeting with the congressmen north has said the 
opposite that he was reluctant to talk with them because he would 
have to conceal a number of matters but that poindexter directed 
him to do so north admitted that he lied at the meeting 
greene denied one motion by poindexters lawyers to prevent all 
or part of norths testimony and said he will rule on the other one 
limiting by the time north takes the witness stand 
i gather that north will be the first government witness 
in the case against poindexter greene said in revealing that 
poindexter had filed the sealed motions lawyers in the case later 
confirmed that north would indeed be the first witness 
opening statements are planned for thursday 
greene said he would consider a poindexter motion seeking to 
limit norths testimony based on fifth amendment rights against 
selfincrimination 
the judge denied the other motion which he said was based on 
perjury that north allegedly committed 
the government alleged at norths trial last year that he had 
given unreliable testimony when he took the witness stand in his 
own defense richard beckler a lawyer for poindexter later 
explained 
in closing arguments at norths trial prosecutor john keker 
said the former white house aide had gotten in the habit of 
lying in the irancontra affair and that he wasnt stopping 
now once he took the witness stand in his own defense 
north made a number of statements at his trial last year that 
could be extremely damaging to poindexter if repeated in the new 
trial 
for example he said he told poindexter that it would be unwise 
to have a meeting in august 1986 with house members inquiring into 
whether north was assisting the contras militarily poindexter 
insisted that north brief the lawmakers anyway telling his 
subordinate that you can handle it you can take care of it 
north testified 
north admitted on the witness stand that he had lied to the 
lawmakers poindexter later sent him a message saying well 
done the incident forms part of the indictment against the 
exnational security adviser 
north is appealing his convictions on three felonies aiding and 
abetting an obstruction of congress in connection with a november 
1985 shipment of hawk missiles to iran altering and destroying 
classified national security councl documents pertaining to norths 
assistance to the contras and accepting a 13800 home security 
system from richard secord 
poindexter is accused of obstructing and lying to congress in 
five felony charges concerning the missile shipment and allegations 
that he covered up norths secret resupply network to the contra 
rebels in nicaragua 
greene in december placed limitations on norths testimony at 
poindexters trial the judge ruled that prosecutors may only 
elicit evidence based on statements north made before july 15 
1987 the day poindexter began giving testimony to congress on 
national television under a grant of immunity from prosecution 
north has said he is unable to differentiate what he knows from 
poindexters immunized testimony and what he knows from his own 
experiences in the irancontra affair under federal law no part 
of the prosecutions case may be derived from a defendants 
immunized testimony

the leader of the democratic opposition 
predicted on wednesday that bulgarias ruling communist party will 
suffer a crushing defeat in free elections he hopes will take place 
this year 
but zhelyu zhelev chairman of the union of democratic forces 
cautioned that the communists led by premier andrei lukanov are 
still a force to reckon with 
we will win the elections without underestimating the 
communist party which is still strong though demoralized by 
now zhelev said 
but if we have just democratic and honest elections i think 
we will win and for us it is not only a question of winning but 
doing so by a large crushing majority 
on jan 15 parliament abolished the guaranteed leading role of 
bulgarias communist party in the wave of reforms sweeping eastern 
europe 
zhelev said a big win was imperative to establishing a strong 
government supported by the people to carry out the required 
reforms in the future 
this type of administration will have to take unpopular 
measures which underscores the need for a strong authoritative 
government which can ask people to make sacrifices and bear 
with restrictions for a period of time he said 
zhelev said his alliance wants two rounds of elections this year 
a preliminary round already scheduled for june by the communist 
government would choose a national assembly to draft a new 
constitution to be followed by fullscale democratic elections 
toward the end of the year 
i think we can fight for this zhelev said but if the 
communist party tries to torpedo the plan we will turn to the 
people with rallies demonstrations and perhaps a referendum 
zhelev said his proposed twostage election process was crucial 
for the opposition because we have no experience whatsoever no 
material base no people wellknown to the public 
he said he hoped talks between the communists and opposition 
groups would resume monday and that the communists would sign a 
crucial agreement on the countrys democratic future 
meetings were suspended feb 12 after the communists refused to 
remove party cells from the workplace and sign a political accord 
considered vital by the opposition 
the communists have since said they are willing to disband the 
cells 
the political agreement he wants signed would provide for the 
clear separation of party and state and the end of state financing 
for the communist party zhelev said 
bulgaria also is beset by an economic crisis it owes the west 
108 billion and is experiencing a worsening shortage of consumer 
goods including inadequate food supplies in parts of the country 
bulgarian reforms began in earnest last nov 10 with the ouster 
of todor zhivkov the longtime hardline communist party chief 
large demonstrations for democracy followed that led to many of the 
old guard leaders being expelled from the party 
the rallies in sofia were the largest since the communists 
consolidated power 43 years earlier 
by december the partys central committee was yielding to 
demands for reforms parliament passed an amnesty for political 
prisoners and erased antistate activity and crimes against 
allied states from the penal code 
on dec 27 the government and the union of democratic forces 
agreed to hold talks

groups of senators maneuvered behind the 
scenes wednesday hoping to toughen controls on automobile and 
industrial pollution as well as to require automakers to produce 
more fuel efficient cars 
as a stream of minor amendments to the clean air bill was 
debated on the senate floor industry lobbyists and the bush 
administration sought to blunt attempts to stengthen the bill 
transporation secretary samuel skinner said in a letter to key 
senators that a proposal that would require automakers dramatically 
to improve fuel economy would have a devastating impact on the 
auto industry and consumers forcing automakers to concentrate on 
making smaller cars 
the fuel economy provision which was in the orignal bill 
approved by a senate committee was strongly opposed by the 
administration and the auto industry and was deleted during the 
negotiations between senate leaders and the white house that 
produced the bill now being debated 
but several senators said wednesday they will try to revive the 
proposal which would require automakers to curb carbon dioxide 
emissions because of concern about global warming the auto 
industry said such curbs would require them to produce cars with a 
fleet average of 40 miles per gallon compared with the current 
requirement of 275 mpg 
it would cost thousands and thousands of jobs and 
decimate the domestic automobile industry said sen don nickels 
rokla 
but other senators including sens timothy wirth dcolo bob 
kerry dmass and richard bryan dnev have argued that 
controls on carbon dioxide are needed to deal with global warming 
carbon dioxide is responsible for nearly half of the 
greenhouse effect said sen albert gore dtenn and motor 
vehicles are the largest single source of carbon dixoide 
emissions 
carbon dioxide is an inevitable product of all combustion of 
fossil fuels it also traps heat that would be radiated by the 
earth into space leading many scientists to predict that its 
buildup in the atmosphere will mena a warming of the earth the 
less gasoline burned the less carbon dioxide produced 
the compromise bill calls for sweeping regulations on 
smogcausing pollution from automobiles and industry requires 
controls on 191 toxic industrial chemicals and would require cuts 
in acid rain pollutants from coalburning electric utility plants 
and factories 
some republican senators complained late wednesday that the 
complex pollution control bill was being pushed through the senate 
too quickly 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine told his 
colleagues he wanted to complete action on the legislation by the 
end of the week when the senate goes on a weeklong recess he 
threatened to keep the senators in session into the weekend if 
necessary 
that prompted complaints from sen william armstrong rcolo 
that the legislation was being rammed down our throats without 
enough time to examine details sen ted stevens ralaska said he 
had only seen the bill on monday 
weve got to complete this bill responded mitchell adding 
that the more time that is spent the more proposed amendments are 
likely to appear delays beyond the upcoming recess could result 
in very lengthy delays perhaps defeat of the bill said mitchell 
in addition to auto emission controls senators also said they 
planned to offer amendments that would restore a provision under 
which the environmental protection agency could impose a pollution 
control plan on a city if state and local officials do not act 
that authority which is in current law was deleted during the 
closeddoor negotiations

one manufacturer of infant pillows and 
cushions the government said was involved in the suffocation of 10 
babies in two years said wednesday that it voluntarily removed its 
product from stores earlier this year 
leo hollander owner of hollander home fashions of newark nj 
said the company stopped making its mothers helper cushion in 
january and told distributors to remove them from stores 
sen alfonse damato rny urged the consumer product safety 
commission on tuesday to recall all the infant pillows that have 
been linked to the deaths inlcuding seven since june 
its time to get get the product off the shelves and out of 
the hands of consumers before any other children are put at risk 
damato said 
hollander said his company does not believe that its product 
is responsible for the death of any infant the product 
labeling warns parents never to leave their children unattended 
he said infants under 5monthsold should never be placed face 
down and left alone to sleep on any type of pillows 
furthermore no pillow should be used for very young infants in 
their cribs he said 
cpsc spokesman dan rumelt said the company voluntarily recalled 
400000 cushions wednesday 
but hollander said the company did not recall cushions bought by 
consumers and only took the action with its distributors awaiting 
cpsc determination 
the cpsc has not determined that this product is the cause of 
this problem he said 
the agency on tuesday warned parents not to let infants sleep on 
the miniature bean bags because 10 babies using the items have 
suffocated since december 1987 
as a result of our investigation we know that at least 10 
companies manufacture a similar product rumelt said 
the agency said negotiations for a recall were continuing with 
other companies which it declined to identify

state child welfare agencies are struggling to 
meet the needs of a growing number of babies born to crackaddicted 
women the department of health and human services said wednesday 
many experts said that providing protective services social 
services or foster care for such children is more complex than for 
other child welfare cases because there is more abandonment and 
violence 
case workers can spend days tracking mothers who give false 
addresses to hospitals and then abandon their babies the report 
by the inspector general said 
in some cities caseworkers are so overwhelmed that hospitals 
are stepping in with their own efforts to recruit foster parents 
the report said 
child welfare administrators and caseworkers hospital social 
services staff foster parents and state and local officials in 12 
cities were interviewed 
only eight of the cities were able to provide the number of 
crack babies reported to the child welfare system these eight 
handled 8974 such children during the previous year 
the report estimated that hospital delivery medical care and 
foster care for these babies through age 5 would be about 500 
million 
the inspector general said the estimates for the eight cities 
along with adjustments for underreporting of crack babies are 
consistent with the presidents national drug control strategy 
report estimate that 100000 babies are born to cocaineusing women 
each year 
prenatal exposure to cocaine can lead to premature birth low 
birthweight birth defects and respiratory and neurological 
problems the report said some experts say that when these 
children are older many will have severe learning disabilities and 
will need special education 
caseloads for child welfare workers in the 12 cities studied 
averaged 49 children for foster care and 161 for protective 
services the report said 
from 50 percent to 95 percent of the crack babies in the cities 
studied went home with their mother or a relative the rest go into 
foster care or some other placement arrangement 
the cities studied were chicago fort wayne ind los angeles 
miami new york newark oakland calif philadelphia phoenix

an australian scientist who sees divine values 
in nature and a hindu lawyer who started communities for lepers in 
india were named wednesday as cowinners of the 1990 templeton 
prize for progress in religion 
the 580000 prize the largest in any field went to 
biologistgeneticist charles k birch of sydney and murlidhar 
devidas amte who established five centers for lepers in the area 
of nagpur india 
the prize was founded in 1972 by financier john templeton a 
presbyterian who keeps the amount higher than the nobel prizes in 
the belief that religion is more important an international panel 
of judges picks the winners 
templeton urged more research into spiritual realities when he 
named the winners at the church center for the united nations 
the accelerating discovery rate in natural sciences needs to 
be matched by mans spiritual progress and discovery he said 
much evidence has been found that gods ongoing creative process 
is accelerating 
the prize winners reflected two aspects of religion its 
intellectual ramifications in science and its altruistic impulse in 
serving the weak 
birch 71 a university of sydney biologist from 1960 until his 
recent retirement and veteran of sciencereligion conferences 
maintains that the interrelationship of nature humanity and god 
finds support in physics 
he wrote that this has been emphasized by the ecological crisis 
which has shown the negative results of a mere mechanistic view of 
nature all actual entities have an inner reality as well as an 
outer reality birch said 
for example he said nothing will save the whales unless 
we attribute to whales intrinsic value in themselves and to god 
birch who has been a research fellow at several us 
universities was cited for his reconciliation of the biological 
and the religious understanding of creation 
amte 75 is called baba or father by colleagues and 
patients his largest leper center covering 450 acres accommodates 
1400 lepers and includes a cottage hospital library cooperative 
shops bank workshops training schools theaters homes for aged 
and infirm lepers and technical college with 7500 students 
amte was born into a wealthy brahmin family educated at a 
christian college and became an attorney but rebelled against 
caste barriers to help untouchables set up cooperatives and unions 
an experience resembling that of st francis initially turned 
amte to serving lepers he said he was so repelled at his first 
encounter with one that he fled then returned to befriend him 
amte like his friend the late mahatma gandhi extolled the 
example of christ but remained a hindu 
everyone should attempt to walk in the shadow of the cross 
he wrote that means you are in the company of that life which 
scuttled itself to save others 
australias un ambassador peter wialenski and indias cr 
gharekan attended the news conference with several religious and 
public leaders 
the prize is to be presented may 8 in london 
templeton said the prize is intended to help people see the 
infinity of ways god acts in the world and reveals himself to 
different cultures adding exciting new advances are being made 
in every religion 
noting that millions are spent annually for research in natural 
sciences he said similar manpower and resources devoted to 
research in spiritual subjects could lead to greater blessings for 
mankind 
previous winners of the prize include mother teresa of calcutta 
evangelist billy graham science philosopher thomas torrance of 
scotland and russian exile writer alexander solzhenitsyn

education secretary lauro cavazos said 
wednesday he was saddened by a confrontation with texas lawmakers 
whose fury erupted after he told them more money would not solve 
the problems of texas schools 
cavazos told a joint session of his home state legislature in 
austin on tuesday that fundamental changes not merely pitching 
money were the answer to improving education 
three hispanic legislators left the chamber during his speech 
another confronted him afterward and then disrupted the secretarys 
news conference to raise heated objections to his views 
the texas legislature is under court order to reform a 
schoolfinancing system that shortchanges poor districts the 
order resulted from a lawsuit brought by the predominantly hispanic 
edgewood school district in san antonio 
cavazos said its the first time he has been attacked by fellow 
hispanic leaders since he became the first hispanic cabinet 
appointee in september 1988 
i wonder if they would have been as angry if the person who 
delivered that address as secretary of education had not been 
hispanic he said it saddens me not because it was a 
personal attack but because people i have so much respect for 
take that kind of tactic in front of television cameras and 
reporters 
what i got yesterday in austin was people who felt the 
solution was more dollars it was quite a confrontation down there 
i was very disappointed that the whole issue had to be focused on 
resources 
sen carlos truan dcorpus christi interrupted the secretarys 
news conference i feel betrayed and i feel embarrassed that the 
secretary of education a minority and from texas would not take 
a more aggressive position regarding the needs of education 
truan said wednesday 
truan chairman of the hispanic caucus in the texas senate said 
cavazos is lacking in commitment to the children of our state and 
of this country by the comments he made here yesterday and i 
regret that 
al kauffman attorney for the mexican american legal defense and 
educational fund said cavazos comments will not help those 
working on behalf of the propertypoor school districts 
kent pogue superintendent of the kingsville independent school 
district where cavazos went to school said he disagreed with 
cavazos contention that more money is not needed for public 
schools 
by disagreeing im not saying that money is the answer but 
money is needed to provide a quality education said pogue 
gov bill clements a republican who has repeatedly vowed to 
veto any new taxes for school finance reform applauded cavazos 
comments 
hes a great educator hes a great texan hes a fine guy 
clements said i liked everything he had to say 
cavazos said he has made the same speech dozens of times and 
taken his message before several congressional committees yet no 
one has been angry with me until this came up the other day 
as examples of the fundamental changes he would like to see 
cavazos said professionals should be able to teach with easier 
certification parents should have more choice of schools for their 
children and principals and teachers should have more control over 
the schools where they work

blockade of four major southern ports on wednesday to protest 
moroccos decision to increase fines for illegal fishing in its 
waters a government official said 
they used their fishing craft to close the ports of algeciras

ferry service and stranding a total of 3500 people on both sides 
of the strait of gibraltar said alfonso garrido central 
government representative in andalusia region 
he said the protest has led to clashes between police and 
fishermen and to food and medicine shortages in spains north 
african enclave of ceuta garrido said it also caused a shortage of 
fish and a steep increase in fish prices in southern spain as well 
as financial losses to ship owners 
the blockade began last thursday after morocco announced it was 
increasing maximum fines to more than 150000 for infractions of 
fishing regulations outlined in its 198892 fishing accord with the

vermont voted to urge president bush to cut military spending by 5 
percent a year for the next five years officials said wednesday 
this is a pioneer effort to bring a grassroots message that 
we want our spending priorities changed said john berkowitz 
organizer of the sanefreeze petition drive that got the referendum 
on town meeting agendas 
vermont is a bellwether state in these issues just like new 
hampshire is in presidential primaries berkowitz said at a news 
conference to announce the referendum results 
of the 141 towns that held meetings monday and tuesday 107 
voted to press the federal government to redirect surplus defense 
money to such programs as education environmental protection 
housing and health care he said 
ten towns shot down the referendum and 11 more towns postponed 
it indefinitely berkowitz said 
in a few other towns including chelsea dummerston and hancock 
residents amended the article they supported the 5 percent 
reduction until it ultimately reaches 50 percent provided that all 
the excess money go toward reducing the federal deficit 
they felt that in solving that problem it would solve many 
others berkowitz said 
president bushs budget is totally out of sync with new 
realities he said the proposed 5 percent drop in military 
spending would be after inflation increases in the military budget 
and would result in essentially level funding 
he said sanefreeze which was set up to push for nuclear arms 
reductions has expanded to become a national organization 
working for peace and social justice and environmental issues 
the presidents 125 trillion budget proposes 303 billion for 
defense including 104 billion for nuclear weapons 
administration officials have said overall defense spending will 
increase but will not keep pace with inflation leading to an 
effective 2 percent reduction 
the referendum was passed in urban and rural areas by 
democrats and republicans and young and old said rep david 
larsen a democrat who is vice chairman of the house education 
committee this is not a partisan issue 
we have our priorities mixed up said rep toby young a 
democrat who is chairwoman of the state house health and welfare 
committee vermonters have seen that the federal priorities are 
mixed up and have done something about it

a battered woman who killed her husband 
after he criticized her cooking was sentenced wednesday to five 
years in prison despite testimony that she suffered years of abuse 
virginia eagan 53 of omro was convicted jan 31 of homicide by 
negligent use of a weapon psychiatrists told jurors that mrs 
eagan suffered from an abuserelated emotional disturbance known as 
battered wife syndrome 
winnebago county circuit judge william e crane said he imposed 
the maximum sentence because battered women syndrome doesnt 
warrant killing someone 
virginia eagan took a gun at close range while both of them 
were drinking and shot him through the heart and killed him 
crane said people have to face up to responsibility 
mrs eagan shot her husband of 32 years eugene eagan 56 
during a july 2 argument over boiled potatoes and beets at the 
couples rural town of omro farm in east central wisconsin 
during the trial both prosecution and defense attorneys 
characterized eagan who was disabled and used a cane to walk as 
an abusive husband who would strike his wife with his canes and 
beat her during drunken outbursts 
defense attorney george curtis said after sentencing that 
sending mrs eagan a grayhaired factory worker who is going 
blind to prison was cruel and compounded the familys tragedy 
i feel this lady has gone through hell and doesnt deserve 
another minute of it she was a helpless victim curtis said 
im really sorry virginia eagan is going off to a new prison 
district attorney joseph paulus said eagans death seems to 
have fallen to the wayside in these proceedings 
the jurys verdict certainly did not excuse the defendants 
behavior he said 
mrs eagan was originally charged with firstdegree reckless 
homicide which carried a maximum 20year prison sentence but the 
jury convicted her on the lesser charge which carries a maximum 
fiveyear penalty

a bipartisan panel called for flexible 
spending limits on congressional campaigns wednesday but did not 
address many of the alleged abuses that have put the issue on the 
front burner in congress 
the panel of experts sided with democrats to support a voluntary 
spending ceiling with discount tv and mail rates as an incentive 
for compliance 
but it rejected democratic calls for public financing and 
instead endorsed republican desires to limit corporate and labor 
political action committees or pacs 
gop desires to loosen rules on indiviudal contributions to 
reduce a perceived advantage by incumbents and to make the 
political parties the engine for raising and spending funds also 
won the panels endorsement 
senate democratic leader george mitchell of maine hailed the 
panels 41page report as breakthrough recommendations for 
untangling a bitterly partisan struggle 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas called it a 
potential breakthrough saying the panel of six experts three 
each picked by dole and mitchell at least touched on some of 
the hot buttons 
democrats nonetheless planned to push through the senate rules 
committee on thursday their version of a bill that has both 
spending caps and provisions for taxpayer financing 
mitchell acknowledged that the bill he is cosponsoring with 
sens david boren dokla and robert c byrd dwva has no 
chance to get past a presidential veto but he said it provides a 
vehicle for negotiations between the parties 
meanwhile rep beryl anthony of arkansas chairman of the 
democratic congressional campaign committee said house democrats 
are nearing completion of a bill that would set a voluntary ceiling 
of 550000 on what a house candidate could spend democrats 
previously had wanted a 400000 ceiling 
the task force called for reasonably high and flexible 
voluntary spending ceilings reflecting the extra costs of running 
in states where advertising in adjacent highcost media markets is 
required but it would not count limited contribtions by instate 
residents to instate candidates 
the panel ignored many issues raised by the savings and loan 
crisis 
for example it did not touch socalled leadership political 
action committees or pacs pacs run by members 
it also had no recommendation on taxexempt foundations of the 
13 million that phoenix sampl operator charles h keating jr 
contributed to five senate candidates 850000 was through a 
taxexempt voter registration foundation headed by the son of sen 
alan cranston dcalif 
the panel called for prohibtions on the bundling or 
gathering of many contributions by business and labor pacs but 
endorsed as little obvious cause for concern such activities by 
individuals 
keating whose failed sampl may cost the taxpayers 2 billion 
bundled more than 200000 in individual contributions from members 
of his family and business associates for the reelection campaigns 
of the five senators 
the five sens john mccain rariz dennis deconcini 
dariz john glenn dohio donald w riegle dmich and 
cranston are now under investigation by the senate ethics 
committee for interceding with regulators on behalf of keatings 
lincoln savings and loan association 
recommendations by the task force include 
giving parties authority to raise and spend unlimited amounts 
on voter registration drives phone banks getoutthevote 
campaigns and direct mail 
raising the 25000 limit an individual can make to a party 
committee 
providing a 100 percent tax credit up to a specified amount 
for any indivual who contributes to a candidate in the 
contributors state 
a modest increase in the current 1000 limit an individual 
can contribute to one candidate and the 25000 ceiling on all 
contributions by an individual 
reducing from 5000 to 2500 the contribution pacs can make 
to a candidate for each of the primary and general elections but 
only after total pac contributions reach onethird of the 
candidates spending limit 
prohibiting pacs from making postelection contributions for 
two years after an election to reduce a candidates campaign debt 
requiring radio and television stations to provide eight hours 
of free time each year to candidates parties would allocate the 
time

the soviet union has failed to meet conditions 
britain set for attending a 1991 human rights conference in moscow 
including those concerning jewish emigration a british group 
reported wednesday 
the group of lawmakers journalists and a student leader said 
that despite progress on human rights the soviet union has met 
only one of the six conditions laid down by britain freedom to 
monitor human rights 
we found evidence of real fear on the part of very many of the 
jews we met that there would be physically violent 
manifestations of the antisemitism they find in their work their 
living environment said legislator paul boateng a member of the 
opposition labor party 
the eightmember group visited moscow feb 2326 on a trip 
organized by britains student and academic campaign for soviet 
jews 
the report was presented wednesday evening to a meeting of about 
750 members of the predominantly jewish organization and was then 
handed to a government representative 
the british factfinding team said human rights abuses continued 
against soviet jews in the five other areas cited by britain 
emigration discrimination freedom of religious and cultural 
expression prisoners of conscience and laws covering emigration 
rights 
the soviet union which is eager to host the conference has 
received acceptances some conditional from most western 
countries britain announced its heavily qualified acceptance last 
year 
we should keep up the pressure said sir anthony kershaw 
exchairman of the house of commons foreign affairs committee 
another member of the group not until later should we decide on 
1991 
kershaw of the governing conservative party said that by 
official count there are 12 million jews in the soviet union but 
the number is probably 3 million to 4 million including people who 
do not register 
last year 105000 soviet jews left he said and about 2000 
have emigrated this year 
many are going to israel as a second choice after the united 
states tightened its entry visas when moscow began allowing 
significant numbers of soviet jews to leave 
during its trip to moscow the british group met with soviet 
officials representatives of refuseniks and jewish organizations 
and andrei sakharovs widow yelena bonner 
kershaw said the number of longterm refuseniks people who 
applied a decade or more ago to leave dropped by 10000 to 60000 
the past year 
those refused permission on grounds they have sensitive 
information included a 76yearold former professor of plant 
breeding said kershaw she retired 16 years ago and her family is 
now in israel he said 
the jews of the soviet union have had a long and bitter 
time said lawmaker sir russell johnston of the centrist social 
and liberal democratic party that time is not over but 
there is hope

czechoslovakia celebrated on 
wednesday the 140th anniversary of the birth of its founding 
father tomas garrigue masaryk in an outpouring of national pride 
and gratitude for newly gained freedom 
he was not only a man who did good for the state but he 
was a man who breathed the idea of morality and truth into its 
foundations president vaclav havel said at a ceremony in 
hodonin masaryks hometown 180 miles east of prague 
masaryk and gen milan stefanik a slovak hero gained us 
president woodrow wilsons support to realize their dream of 
independent czechoslovakia in 1918 
masaryk was erased from history books first by the nazis and 
then by the communists after they took power in 1948 he was 
depicted as a bourgeois capitalist who meant little for 
czechoslovakia 
in the face of police harassment havel and other dissidents 
supported masaryks image as the founder of independent and free 
czechoslovakia during the years of harsh communist rule that ended 
with last years revolution 
the communists despised masaryk not only as a symbol of 
preworld war ii democracy but for being an intellectual beloved 
by czechoslovaks and respected worldwide 
masaryk a philosopher by profession entered politics in his 
60s he was a strong advocate of the unity of czechs and slovaks 
the countrys two main ethnic groups 
just now in the times of new programs and perspectives let 
us remember masaryk striving for silent practical and active inner 
qualities proceeding from words to deeds petr pithart the 
prime minister of the czech lands said at a parallel ceremony in 
prague the official ctk news agency reported 
celebrations of masaryks anniversary were held throughout the 
country 
earlier havel and czechoslovak prime minister marian calfa laid 
wreaths at the masaryk grave in lany 30 miles west of prague

former world chess champion anatoly karpov faces 
only one obstacle jan timman of the netherlands on karpovs 
comeback path to a rematch this fall with the games other king 
fellow soviet garri kasparov 
timman the thirdranking player in the world takes on karpov 
beginning thursday 
their 12game contest in the malaysian capital kuala lumpur is 
scheduled to end april 4 the winner gains the right to play the 
26yearold soviet titleholder in a 24game marathon in the fall 
karpov 38 world champion for 10 years before losing to 
kasparov in 1985 is strongly favored to win and challenge kasparov 
for a recordbreaking fifth time in a title bout 
timmans supporters are hoping he can exploit karpovs 
relatively poor form over the last year and pull off an upset 
of course karpov is the favorite but if timman is in good 
condition the situation is unclear said kasparov speaking by 
telephone from spain 
if both players are nervous or off their form then karpov will 
win the champion said but if timman plays well he could 
produce some surprises 
kasparov said he might enjoy facing a new opponent but there 
were also advantages in taking on his archrival again it would 
give me a chance to beat karpov convincingly he said 
timman 38 is a celebrity at home he frequently appears on 
dutch talk shows and has appeared in a television commercial as 
well 
the prize fund of 450000 at the world chess championship 
candidates final in malaysia will be split with fiveeights going 
to the winner 
however a west german computer company is offering a prize of 
15 million to the first westerner to challenge kasparov 
most dutch writers have been saying timman will be destroyed 
by karpov said kik shouten an editor at the dutch magazine 
new in chess 
but one or two commentators say timman has some chances 
because of karpovs recent form 
in recent years kasparov and karpov have dominated world chess 
but in a january world ranking kasparov established a crushing 
lead while timman closed on karpov 
in a competition last june karpov lost his last three games 
allowing timman to slip into first place karpov had never before 
lost three in a row in an international career stretching 20 years 
karpov defeated his heavily outranked soviet compatriot artur 
yusupov 4535 after winning the eighth and final game in the 
candidates semifinal in october but karpov almost fell behind in 
the sixth game 
and in january karpov finished third behind two soviet 
grandmasters in a competition in italy 
if timman ever had any chances to beat karpov he has them 
now said dutch chess historian rob verhoeven 
but british grandmaster raymond keene pointed to karpovs 
overwhelming superiority over timman in their past encounters 
according to keene karpov has defeated timman 14 times and lost 
three with 27 games drawn he said timman hasnt beaten karpov 
since 1980 
the details of the showdown with kasparov are not yet clear 
the international chess federation has awarded the title duel to 
lyon france 
however ted field a los angeles businessman and film producer 
said he wants to stage the final in a leading american city 
kasparov has indicated a strong preference for holding at least 
half the contest in the united states most likely new york

the former afghan defense minister 
who led a coup attempt defected wednesday to the moslem guerrillas 
he fought for more than a decade sources said 
gen shah nawaz tanai fled afghanistan on wednesday with his 
wife two daughters and son then returned with the usbacked 
insurgents according to rebel and pakistani government sources 
president najib again claimed that the coup tanai launched 
tuesday had absolutely been broken of that there is no doubt 
tanais flight seemed to indicate this but western diplomats 
and guerrilla leaders based in pakistan said fighting continued 
although on a smaller scale 
in washington assistant secretary of state john kelly told a 
congressional panel that the fighting had spread from kabul the 
capital to the towns of jalalabad kandahar and kost 
western diplomats and guerrilla leaders in pakistan all of whom 
spoke on condition of anonymity also said they had reports of 
fighting in kandahar and in the city of herat 
rival factions in the afghan forces were reported battling for 
control of bagram the countrys largest air base 
guerrilla sources and western diplomats in islamabad said 
tanais forces had won control of the base najib ordered warplanes 
to bomb it and several sovietsupplied scud missiles were also 
fired they said 
bagram is completely destroyed said one guerrilla source 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
afghanistans charge daffaires in pakistan qudratullah ahmadi 
denied the base had fallen to the mutineers who had the support of 
the moslem guerrillas 
the diplomats and rebel sources also told of sporadic street 
fighting in kabul 
najib said a number of people mostly civilians had been 
killed or injured during nearly 20 hours of fighting he gave no 
specific figures but guerrilla sources said there were hundreds of 
casualties 
before the coup began najib said tanai who had been defense 
minister threw away his identification card from the ruling 
peoples democratic party of afghanistan and his military uniform 
tanai escaped with valuable government documents najib said 
tanai a battlehardened soldier popular with the rankandfile 
military has been accused of engineering three coup attempts 
against najibs government guerrilla sources said tanai contacted 
guerrilla leader gulbuddin hekmatyar before leaving afghanistan and 
that one of hekmatyars commanders had been with tanai since the 
coup attempt was launched 
such an alliance would be more one of convenience than ideology 
tanai a marxist hardliner has long advocated a harsh stance 
against the usbacked guerrillas and opposed najibs methods of 
dealing with the war and his peace efforts 
at the same time the radical fundamentalist hekmatyar has 
become increasingly estranged from his fellow moslem guerrilla 
leaders rejecting their political leadership and executing some of 
their followers 
the latest bid to bring down najibs government began tuesday 
afternoon when afghan air force planes bombed the presidential 
palace in the heart of kabul and widespread fighting was reported 
in the capital 
on wednesday afternoon tanai boarded a military helicopter that 
flew flanked by two fighter jets to a military base in northern 
pakistan guerrilla sources said 
after landing they said tanai talked with several guerrillas 
engaged in the 11year war against the afghan government 
later he returned with them to a point deeper in afghanistan 
to continue the struggle against najib said foreign secretary 
tamveer ahmed of pakistan 
a sovietmade transport plane carrying 12 people including 
three afghan brigadier generals also landed wednesday near the 
border town of parachinar government and guerrilla sources said 
among the generals was gen abdul qadar akka a former air 
defense commander who was implicated with tanai in a coup attempt 
in december neither officer was ever charged they said the 
identities of the other two generals were not disclosed 
radio kabul accused another highranking party member asadullah 
sarwari of involvement in the coup plot sarwari was a former 
interior minister accused of hundreds of killings following the 
1978 revolution that installed a communist government and sparked 
the civil war 
the soviet union withdrew its troops from afghanistan in 
february 1989 after nine years of direct military intervention but 
continue to ship billions of dollars in arms to the afghan armed 
forces 
the united states pakistan and saudi arabia support the 
guerrillas 
although one of the most antiwestern of the seven guerrilla 
groups most of the us weapons have gone to hekmatyars 
hebziislami or party of islam 
tanai belonged to a faction of the ruling party that is a bitter 
rival of najib he had opposed najibs peace overtures to the 
guerrillas to try to end the civil war which has claimed more than 
1 million lives destroyed tens of thousands of villages and ruined 
the countrys economy 
since the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan najibs troops 
have held their ground against the insurgents but guerrilla 
leaders in pakistan and army officers in afghanistan have said at 
least seven other plots to overthrow najib have been uncovered

booby traps and leaks forced south 
korean and us teams to stop searching a border tunnel dug by the 
communist north as a possible invasion route military officials 
said wednesday 
at least 10 booby traps have been dismantled since a dog working 
with inspection teams was killed sunday when it apparently set off 
an explosion officials said no soldier has been injured 
the teams were draining the shaft of water after plugging it 
with sandbags for protection defense ministry officials said 
wednesday 
the tunnel was drilled open saturday through an intercept tunnel 
from the southern sector of the demilitarized zone separating the 
capitalist south from north korean 
it was the fourth tunnel discovered since 1974 beneath the zone 
but north korea has denied digging any tunnels 
an american officer and a south korean soldier searching the 
first tunnel discovered in 1974 were reportedly killed as were 10 
others in 1975 and 1978 while searching two other tunnels 
south korean officials believe north korea dug more than 20 
border passages under the heavily fortified border to allow 
commando units to bypass south koreas frontline soldiers in the 
event of an invasion 
a military report presented tuesday to a national assembly 
committee said about 250 us specialists are working to help 
discover other tunnels

a group of congressmen protested wednesday the 
armys decision to retroactively revoke an rotc scholarship given 
to a star recruit who later admitted he is gay 
in a letter to brig gen charles r hansell head of the rotc 
second regional command at fort knox ky 23 members asked the 
army to abandon its attempt to recover 25000 in scholarship money 
given to james m holobaugh 
the army was set to award a commission last may when holobaugh 
24 at member of the reserve officer training corps at washington 
university in st louis disclosed his homosexuality 
after a preliminary hearing in december a hearing officer 
recommended in january that the army order holobaugh to repay the 
fouryear scholarship 
we believe that to compel him to repay this money would not 
only be fundamentally unfair it would also reflect an appalling 
meanspiritedness which has no place in the rotc the lawmakers 
said in a twopage letter 
there was no answer at hansells office early wednesday evening 
last week lt col john calvin blake an army rotc spokesman said 
the case was probably the first of its kind 
the investigation is still ongoing and whatever the hearing 
officer recommended has to go through a careful review before there 
is a final decision blake said 
the pentagon regards homosexuals as unsuitable for military 
service the us supreme court recently dealt opponents of that 
policy a blow by refusing to hear two appeals of the pentagon 
policy 
us rep gerry studds dmass who is gay drafted the letter 
most of the signers were democrats although two republicans reps 
bill green of new york and christopher shays of connecticut also 
signed another who signed the letter was rep barney frank 
dmass the only other member of congress who has publicly stated 
he is gay 
throughout his career as a cadet mr holobaugh has compiled 
an enviable record of performance with rotc evaluations describing 
him as possessing outstanding leadership potential the letter 
said 
the legislators also noted that the army had held holobaugh up 
as a public model of excellence in rotc recruitment 
advertisements 
holobaugh who expects to graduate in the spring said he was 
dating women when he began college in 1984 and that it wasnt until 
late 1988 or early 1989 that he realized he was homosexual

the justice department has no objections to 
the planned purchase of latin american routes by american airlines 
from eastern airlines the department said wednesday 
the proposed 471 million transaction still must be approved by 
the transportation department and the bankruptcy court in new york 
overseeing the reorganization of eastern 
completion of the route sale is a necessary condition for final 
approval of a reorganization agreement between eastern and its 
unsecured creditors under that accord the unsecured creditors who 
are owed 980 million by eastern would receive about 490 million 
in cash and notes 
joe krovisky spokesman for the justice departments antitrust 
division said the division informed the two companies and the 
transportation department that its review of potential antitrust 
ramifications of the sale had yielded no reason to object

transportation department arguing that it would eventually make 
american the dominant airline in miami pan am asked for a public 
hearing on the issue 
eastern and american have until march 13 to file replies to pan 
ams objections transportation department spokesman hal paris said 
a decision on the sale probably would be made in three or four 
weeks

would take over easterns routes to ecuador peru colombia 
bolivia panama guatemala costa rica and paraguay 
pan am told the transportation department that it rather than 
american should be awarded service from miami to guayaquil and 
quito ecuador lima peru and bogota colombia 
included in the transfer would be easterns miamitoronto route 
which pan am said it should be awarded 
if eastern sheds the routes it would be about twothirds its

the leader of italys communist party late 
wednesday urged members to support radical changes in the party in 
hopes of uniting the nations fractured left 
achille occhetto spoke at an extraordinary congress that will 
decide on his proposal which could lead to the rebirth of the 
party with a new name and without its hammer and sickle symbol 
the problems facing communism not only affect the countries of 
eastern europe but also our very own country occhetto said 
occhetto secretary of the wests largest communist party 
stunned other party leaders in november when three days after the 
opening of the berlin wall he called for overhauling the party in 
line with reforms sweeping the east bloc 
the partys central committee endorsed occhettos proposal but 
called for an extraordinary congress to decide the issue 
about 67 percent of the 1092 delegates are loyal to occhetto 
more than enough to assure the success of his proposal in voting on 
saturday 
the proposal has been opposed by members of the old guard which 
wants much more limited reforms 
longtime members argue that the party can be proud of its 
traditions they also say the party has criticized abuses by 
sovietbloc governments and should not panic and endorse dramatic 
changes just because communism has collapsed in eastern europe 
italian communists have long proclaimed their independence from 
moscow pledged their support for western parliamentary democracy 
suppprted italys membership in nato and criticised moscows 
interventions in czechoslovakia in 1968 and in afghanistan in 1979 
the communists have been kept out of power for 45 years but 
occhetto said wednesday night that a new party could help forge 
socialist unity in italy bring the countrys fractured left under 
a single umbrella and pose an alternative to the christian 
democrats who have dominated or led every postwar government 
he said the communists can move closer to the greens radicals 
and liberal catholics within the christian democrats 
the socialists italys thirdlargest party after christian 
democrats and the communists have been coalition partners with the 
christian democrats in the last decade they also hope to surpass 
the communists in the polls and become the de facto leader of the 
italian left 
over the last 20 years italian communists have seen a steady 
decline both in membership now about 14 million and in their 
strength at the polls

the un human rights commission agreed wednesday 
to begin a special investigation into allegations of abuses in 
haiti and to continue monitoring the situations in iran and el 
salvador 
in recognition of recent democratic elections in chile the 
43nation commission agreed to drop chile from the countries 
meriting close attention because of consistent and gross violations 
the commission voted not to act on a mildly worded resolution 
that would have secured an official role for the united nations in 
a planned visit by human rights experts to iraq 
iraq was cited last month for its abyssmal human rights 
record in a us state department report 
the commission adopted without a vote a resolution sponsored by 
france and peru to appoint a special investigator on haiti saying 
the situation under gen prosper avril remains disturbing and 
even seems to have deteriorated since july 1989 
it said it was alarmed by the proliferation of acts of 
violence in haiti particularly against arrested or detained 
persons and by the apparent inability of the judicial system to 
put an end to such acts 
the commission is the united nations highest human rights body 
it said in agreeing to continue the annual investigation into the 
el salvador situation started in 1981 that it was concerned at 
the spiral of abuses committed by both extreme rightwing death 
squads and leftist rebels 
a resolution voiced deep concern at the continued 
unsatisfactory capacity of the judicial system to track down 
those responsible for violations 
the commission also agreed by consensus to continue its 
investigation on iran expressing concern at complaints of unlawful 
executions and torture cited in a recent report by un expert 
reynaldo galindo pohl 
it welcomed tehrans favorable reception to suggestions by 
galindo pohl after his brief visit to iran in january the first by 
a un investigator 
the salvadoran lawyer will make a second trip there at irans 
invitation prior to his report to the commissions 1991 session 
galindo pohls recommendations included one that the 
international committee of the red cross be allowed to visit 
prisoners throughout iran 
the mildness of the resolution drew fire from the united states 
we regret how little evidence there is that iran has sought to 
moderate its grave human rights violations said us 
representative beverly zweiben 
summary executions of prisoners continue as does imprisonment 
for political purposes 
iranian ambassador sirous nasseri attacked the us stand as 
arrogance in the only vote of the day the commission voted 
1814 to take no action on a westernbacked proposal that the 
subcommission on prevention of discrimination and protection of 
minorities report back to the commission its parent body on a 
planned visit to iraq 
the proposal said the united nations should sponsor the visit 
the decision means the subcommissions 26 legal experts will be 
free to visit iraq as individuals but will be bound to report back 
to the commission 
the commission agreed without a vote that no further need 
existed for a special un investigator on chile now that the 
recently elected government of patricio alywin promised restoration 
of human rights 
under the military rule of gen augusto pinochet chile joined 
south africa and israel in being regularly criticized for grave 
human rights violations at the commissions annual session 
the sixweek meeting ends friday

premier hans modrow said wednesday that east 
germans are ready to sign a border treaty with poland and he 
criticized west germany for trying impose a hasty unity plan on his 
people 
the communist premier and other top east german officials have 
lately displayed irritation with west german chancellor helmut kohl 
and the fast pace of unification sought by their western neighbor 
in bonn opposition social democrats who also charge that kohl 
is pushing too hard for a speedy unification insisted on a 
germanywide referendum over the issue 
modrows concerns over unification echoed those of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev who on tuesday urged a slow and 
careful approach and said nato membership for a united germany was 
out of the question 
at the last parliamentary session before east germans go to the 
polls on march 18 modrow sought to assure poland that his nation 
lays no claim to german lands forfeited after the nazi defeat in 
1945 
about one third of modernday poland was german land under the 
third reich 
kohl has been evasive and ambiguous in statements on the 
border modrow said 
kohl on tuesday agreed to support a west german parliamentary 
declaration of respect for the current border but did not make 
clear whether he thought the two germanys could jointly recognize 
the border before they are reunited 
in washington the white house on wednesday praised kohls 
latest stand as a positive and important step as the president 
has made clear the us recognizes the current germanpolish 
border said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
the premier said he and kohl had received a letter signed by 32 
us senators calling on both german states to negotiate separate 
border treaties with poland into one single accord 
east germany is prepared to do this immediately modrow said 
west german government spokesman hans klein repeated that bonn 
would begin negotiations on such an accord only after the east 
german elections seat a new government 
modrow said an accord recognizing the oder and neisse rivers as 
the permanent border could be negotiated by the two germanys the 
accord could be ratified immediately after unification he said 
kohl and the social democrats differ not only on the pace of 
unification but on the means 
the social democrats have sought unification through creation of 
a new constitution by the german people the chancellor has said he 
favors unification under a section of the constitution permitting 
individual east german states to decide for themselves whether to 
join their western neighbor 
such a procedure would likely be the quickest route 
on the issue of a unified germanys role in nato the social 
democrats said the organization and the warsaw pact should at some 
point be replaced by a european security system including the 
soviet union the united states and canada 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd said wednesday britain 
believed strongly that a united germany should remain in nato it 
would be sensible for the stability of europe he said answering 
questions in the house of commons 
modrow also criticized central bankers with the west german 
bundesbank for leaking details of a working paper on how the two 
germanys could merge economically 
der spiegel magazine and other media have reported what they 
described as a secret agreement among financial officials from both 
nations to make the west german mark legal tender in both states 
and to exchange much of the 10 billion in east german savings 
accounts at a onetoone rate 
reports of a prearranged monetary union have been denied by 
officials in both germanys who contend no decisions will be made 
before the east german election 
but the rumors have hurt the west german marks value on 
international markets prompting some fearful east germans to 
withdraw their savings and have inflated the exchange rate for 
nonconvertible east marks among blackmarket traders 
it must be clearly said which side is pushing for excessive 
haste and spreading rumors modrow told parliament its clear 
a monetary union cant be built in a day it must be thoroughly 
prepared 
he said speculation stirred by the monetary union leaks are 
further damaging east germanys economy 
the social democrats trying to woo citizens of both nations as 
the unification process continues also proposed immediate measures 
for the social security of east germans who could face 
hardships as their nation undergoes major economic changes 
parliament speaker guenther maleuda also lashed out at west 
german politicians for interfering in the east german election 
campaign 
kohl foreign minister hansdietrich genscher and former 
chancellor willy brandt are among those public figures who appear 
to be using the east german campaign as a dress rehearsal for 
december elections in west germany as well as to expand their 
partys voter support in anticipation of reunification 
let the candidates from our country take over the campaign 
rostrum for the first free fair and secret elections to 
parliament maleuda said 
also on wednesday the east german defense ministry responded to 
reports from washington alleging some soviet ss23 missiles based 
in east germany were a possible violation of the 1987 
superpower treaty on eliminating intermediaterange nuclear forces 
defense ministry spokesman col uwe hempel said the rockets were 
not covered by the inf accord but that their destruction had begun 
by agreement with the soviet union

us district judge robert aguilar was a 
liar who tried to use his influence to sway criminal cases and 
thwart investigations a federal prosecutor said in closing 
arguments in the judges trial wednesday 
but aguilars lawyer described the judge as a kind sweet 
generous man who had done some foolish and improper 
things to reassure his friends but had not tampered with justice 
dont let the federal bench lose a man of this quality 
defense lawyer patrick hallinan urged the jury he contended that 
the fbi after interviewing aguilars fellow judges and finding no 
improper influences proceeded to try to create a crime by 
entrapping aguilar in secretly taped conversations 
the arguments were to conclude thursday and the case was to go 
to the jury 
in his closing argument to the us district court jury justice 
department lawyer william keefer said aguilar lied to the fbi told 
a witness to lie to the grand jury and lied repeatedly as a 
witness in his own defense 
keefer said aguilar made a corrupt endeavor to influence two 
fellow judges in criminal cases falsely told a deputy marshal he 
was unaware of a fugitives whereabouts and tried to manufacture a 
coverup when the fbi closed in on him 
the prosecutor said possible motives were a house purchase on 
generous terms from the woman who was a fugitive an interestfree 
loan from a defendant in one of the criminal cases and another 
defendants help in getting a job for a brother of the judge 
keefer said aguilar was a man who thought he could get away with 
breaking the rules because of his office 
aguilar told an unequivocal lie to fbi agents and fabricated 
a story to get a grand jury investigation sidetracked confident 
that when a federal judge shuts the door the doors usually 
shut keefer said 
the greatest failure of the prosecution is the absence of any 
motive hallinan countered in his closing argument on aguilars 
behalf 
the foolish things he said aguilar had done included some 
lies and exaggerations to codefendant rudy thams lawyer and 
others secretly recorded and played for the jury and a continued 
association with codefendant abe chapman an elderly relative by 
marriage with a long criminal record 
but ladies and gentlemen we are not in a church we are in a 
court hallinan said 
the 58yearold judge from san jose who was appointed in 1980 
by president carter is charged with eight felonies punishable by 
up to 55 years in prison and 2 million in fines on conviction he 
also could be removed from office by congress regardless of the 
verdict 
aguilar is accused of approaching two fellow judges to seek 
favorable treatment for tham a former teamster leader who was 
seeking a new trial on an embezzlement conviction and businessman 
ronald cloud a longtime friend of aguilars convicted of bank 
fraud in a nevada casino sale 
he is accused of helping his former legal secretary vera hoff 
conceal her presence in mexico where she fled in 1979 to avoid a 
twoyear sentence for tax evasion 
aguilar is also accused of twice disclosing a wiretap to 
chapman asking thams attorney to conceal their discussions about 
the case from the grand jury and lying to the fbi about the tham 
case and the chapman wiretaps 
aguilar testified that he spoke briefly to us district judge 
stanley weigel asking about the status of thams case and to us 
district judge samuel conti mentioning that cloud was a friend as 
a preface to a request to appear as a character witness 
weigel and conti both said they didnt think aguilar was trying 
to influence them

the house ethics committee decided wednesday 
to drop its investigation of republican whip newt gingrich but will 
criticize his failure to disclose the purchase of a home the 
lawmaker who filed the complaint against him said 
the ethics committee has resolved the gingrich matter by 
deciding not to investigate further but by deciding to admonish 
gingrich for not reporting his purchase of a home with his 
daughter said rep bill alexander dark 
a house source speaking only on condition he not be identified 
provided the same information about the committee decision on the 
georgia republican 
the panel formally the committee on standards of official 
conduct met behind closed doors wednesday but made no 
announcement 
gingrichs case has generated keen interest because he filed the 
ethics complaint that triggered the investigation and eventual 
resignation last year of former speaker jim wright 
a chicago law firm hired to provide the committee advice on the 
gingrich case reportedly told the panel late last year that there 
was insufficient evidence to pursue the investigation 
alexander who filed two separate complaints against gingrich 
called the committee action a practical resolution of the 
gingrich matter futher disciplinary actions against mr gingrich 
are therefore not needed at the present time 
gingrich spokesman tony blankley said his boss would not 
immediately comment on the committee decision because there had 
been no formal notification from the panel 
in a complaint filed with the committee last october alexander 
said that gingrich failed to make the required disclosure of the 
purchase of the home with his daughter in fulton county ga in 
june 1986 
the complaint said that gingrichs annual financial disclosure 
forms beginning in 1986 failed to report the home purchase failed 
to list the property as an asset and failed to list the 77800 
mortgage as a liability 
members do not have to disclose financial information about 
homes they live in but gingrich said last year this home was for 
his daughter 
at the time gincrich said he was incensed that the fact that 
i helped my daughter by cosigning or signing the note or 
whatever one calls it gets drug out and becomes a story 
he said alexanders decision to include his daughters mortgage 
in the complaint carries politics in the house to a new low 
level i mean it just strikes me as madness 
alexander triggered the gingrich probe last april with a 
complaint that the no 2ranking house republican violated violated 
house rules and federal campaign finance laws in the operation of a 
limited partnership created in 1984 the cos limited 
partnership promoted window of opportunity a book written by 
gingrich and two others 
the partnership was made up of 21 individuals who each put up 
5000 to promote the book gingrich was not an investor but his 
wife a coauthor was paid more than 10000 for running the 
operation 
the complaint contended the 105000 raised by the partnership 
could be considered income to gingrich in violation of house 
limits on members outside earnings or it could constitute a gift 
to gingrich in violation of house rules that prohibit members from 
accepting gifts worth more than 100 from anyone with a direct 
interest in legislation 
the compliant also contended that if the money were considered 
to be campaign contributions gingrich would be in violation of 
reporting obligations and restrictions under campaign finance laws 
the second complaint filed in october charged gingrich with a 
long list of alleged campaign finance and financial disclosure 
violations

hill high school in fayette county 
the association which represents 16000 of the states 22000 
public school teachers says average teacher pay in the state was 
21904 49th in the nation behind mississippi before a 5 percent 
pay raise last month an additional 3000 teachers are represented 
by the west virginia federation of teachers 
the walkout began after caperton and legislative leaders on 
tuesday withdrew their offer of an additional 5 percent pay raise 
beginning in july for teachers and higher education employees in 
exchange they wanted an end to strike threats by the two teacher 
unions 
the agreement collapsed 14 hours after it was announced after 
the wvea refused to call off the strike saying instead it would 
defer action until after saturdays end of the legislative session 
house speaker chuck chambers and senate president keith burdette 
said the continued strike threat made it impossible for them to win 
passage of the pay raise which would have been financed by a new 
1 per ton tax on coal mining 
some teachers blamed the walkout on caperton 
we did not want to strike said ted dixon copresident of 
the fayette county education association but hes put the 
teachers in west virginia in this posture 
about 1000 students from five monongalia county secondary 
schools left classes wednesday in support of their teachers the 
walkouts lasted less than an hour 
school staff employees in monongalia county were urged not to 
cross teachers picket lines beginning thursday 
we support our teachers said janice wilson president of 
monongalia county school service personnel we dont think they 
should be 49th in the nation in pay but we dont think a walkout 
is the answer 
at back creek elementary near inwood in berkeley county parents 
plan to join teachers on the picket line thursday to show their 
support said parents organizer debbie dunnigan 
we want to send a message to governor caperton that were mad 
as hell that were not going to put up with this anymore and if 
we dont invest in our childrens future today theres not going 
to be a future for them tomorrow dunnigan said 
county school boards canceled classes wednesday in many counties 
hit by the strike in boone county 17 of 433 teachers reported for 
work 
state law does not permit teachers or other employees to engage 
in collective bargaining and attorney general roger tompkins said 
he has found nothing in the law to permit a strike 
the teacher unions however contend a 1980 supreme court 
decision gives all public employees the right to engage in work

lithuanias parliament will meet this weekend to 
declare independence from the soviet union activists in the baltic 
republic said wednesday 
sweeping victories in recent elections have given backers of 
sajudis the proindependence popular movement dominance in the 
lithuanian parliament and sajudis leaders have decided to force 
the issue of secession activist audris siaurusavicius said 
vilnius radio reported that lithuanian president algirdas 
brazauskas met with president mikhail s gorbachev on monday to 
discuss secession and was presented with a bill for 34 billion 
that the republic supposedly owes the soviet union for resources 
invested there 
but lithuania has not presented its bill yet to the soviet 
union for losses incurred by 50 years of soviet rule 
siaurusavicius said 
brazauskas speaking wednesday night on lithuanian television 
said there was no need to frighten ourselves and others about 
the economic consequences of secession he said the republic would 
be so much better off on its own that the advantages would offset 
its debt to moscow according to eduardas potashinskas another 
sajudis activist 
according to a draft law currently under consideration in the 
soviet legislature a republic that wants to secede faces a series 
of lengthy procedures including a fiveyear coolingoff period and 
required approval from the 2250member congress of peoples 
deputies 
the soviet constitution guarantees republics the right to 
secede but the procedure has not been spelled out in soviet law 
the parliament is sure to come out with some form of 
declaration of independence when it meets sunday said 
potashinskas an editor at lithuanian tv in a telephone interview 
from vilnius lithuanias capital 
prosecession sentiment in lithuania has been swelling for 
months but sajudis decided to move now to preempt gorbachevs 
plans for a vastly more powerful presidency with the right to crack 
down on restive republics the national congress is to meet monday 
to consider the presidency proposal 
why so fast i think gorbachev himself created such a 
reaction said siaurusavicius a reporter for rebirth the 
sajudis newspaper if there were no such proposal on the 
presidency we wouldnt have done this now 
gorbachev has repeatedly denounced separatists and asked 
activists to give moscow time to work out the terms of a new soviet 
federation before moving to secede 
the lithuanian supreme soviet will meet saturday night to settle 
procedural questions and address independence on sunday said 
siaurusavicius 
siaurusavicius said it was not clear what changes would 
immediately follow the declaration we just have to say it this 
is not secession but its saying they must end their annexation 
they should leave 
all three baltic republics latvia lithuania and estonia were 
independent nations between the two world wars they were annexed 
by the soviet union in 1940 while under occupation by the red army 
siaurusavicius said sajudis leaders were expecting moscows 
response to the declaration of independence to be restrained and 
did not anticipate use of force but he said the republic of 37 
million people could already feel the effects of a mounting soviet 
economic blockade with many factories hurting for raw materials 
and expecting the pinch to get worse 
he predicted the soviet union would probably not be among the 
first to respond to lithuanias planned appeal to the countries of 
the world to recognize it as a fullfledged sovereign state 
the declaration will technically be merely a reconfirmation of 
lithuanias declaration of independence in 1918 siaurusavicius 
said 
last month the lithuanian parliament passed a measure declaring 
as unlawful and invalid the 1940 act that incorporated the 
republic into the soviet union it called for talks with the 
kremlin on restoring lithuanian independence 
an article in the government newspaper izvestia on wednesday 
complained that lithuania is getting public opinion used to the 
fact that it is leaving without thinking through the economic 
and political difficulties secession will create 
god can we really imagine what pain suffering clashes and 
insults this break threatens wrote l kapeliushny izvestias 
correspondent in vilnius 
he listed among expected problems trade imbalances the 
difficulty of deciding what to do about various sovietbuilt 
factories and the fate of lithuanian residents who want to retain 
their soviet citizenship 
about half the soviet unions 15 republics now have popular 
groups pushing for independence or greater sovereignty including 
moldavia georgia armenia azerbaijan estonia and latvia

sandinista leaders say theyll hand 
over the government on april 25 but their local forces dont 
appear ready to hand over their guns 
the army a party organ is delivering truckloads of assault 
rifles to civilians in jinotega and matagalpa provinces who live in 
the poor neighborhoods the leftist sandinistas regard as their 
social base 
all the barrios have guns they are all defending their 
land said francisca castileblanco a 52yearold tortilla 
vendor showing off her new ak47 
highranking sandinista officials in jinotega and matagalpa at 
first denied civilians were being armed 
when confronted with evidence the officials asserted they were 
creating a selfdefense network to fend off possible attacks by 
contra forces that the sandinistas have been battling for years 
but they also acknowledged that guns are going to people living 
on land confiscated after the 1979 revolution areas the party 
regards as its grassroots 
the sandinistas have said they will defend the conquests of 
the revolution including opposing any efforts to return land to 
previous owners and possibly other aspects of the conservative 
economic policies of the new government of presidentelect violeta 
barrios de chamorro 
cuban president fidel castro said wednesday he is cutting off 
all military aid to nicaragua before the chamorro government takes 
office on april 25 cubas official news agency prensa latina 
monitored in mexico city reported 
it quoted castro as saying that cuban assistance in housing 
construction and health care could continue if the new government 
desires 
officials of the united national opposition say they wont 
dislodge peasants from land that is being worked even if it was 
expropriated under sandinista rule 
there is a little tension acknowledged col manuel 
salvatierra the regional military commander there is a lot of 
uncertainty about what will happen when the new government takes 
over 
international observers diplomats and opposition officials are 
worried about the largescale distribution of weapons at a time 
when tensions are so high 
its a time bomb said luis serrano part of the 
organization of american states observer team monitoring matagalpa 
and jinotega provinces 
officials of the united national opposition the conservative 
coalition that defeated the sandinistas in the feb 25 elections 
say they have reports of arms being distributed in several other 
provinces and that the issue is on the agenda for transition 
negotiations between the sandinistas and uno 
uno representatives have also met with topranking regional 
officials of the sandinista party and the sandinista army said 
santiago rivas unos legal adviser in matagalpa 78 miles north of 
managua 
weve argued that they shouldnt give arms to civilians it 
could provoke a civil war rivas said in an interview 
their rallies resound with political battle cries such as one 
single army a slogan expressing the revolutionary goal of 
melding the people the party and the military into a united armed 
force 
they are trying to intimidate said the rev eliar pineda a 
roman catholic priest in jinotega whose family backed uno 
sandinista gangs known as turbas have demonstrated in 
jinotega 100 miles north of managua and in matagalpa since the 
election intimidated uno supporters have stayed at home rather 
than celebrate the coalitions resounding victory at the polls 
they are afraid of provoking the sandinistas pineda said 
rivas said uno fears an attempt to destabilize the country 
during the delicate transition from a leftist sandinista government 
to the uno with its freemarket philosphy 
the top sandinista leadership seems disposed to hand over 
power but at the midlevel there are those who want to create a 
coup at the base of the party he said 
president daniel ortega has said there will be a peaceful 
transition of power but he and other sandinista leaders have made 
it clear the smoothness of that transition depends in large part 
upon negotiations to demobilize the usbacked contras and an 
agreement on the armed forces 
property is another critical issue in the transition 
uno policy is to privatize as much as possible of the staterun 
economy without evicting people from confiscated lands but 
sandinista campaign rhetoric and the partycontrolled media have 
spread fear and doubt among the poor 
the people here are afraid of losing their land said mrs 
castileblanco the tortilla vendor and a party organizer in barrio 
roger angin a slum of 400 homes without water and electricity on 
confiscated land on the edge of jinotega 
she went into her house a ramshackle shell of mismatched planks 
and tin over a dirt floor and pulled out her new ak47 
it is one of 400 assault rifles she and her neighbors said the 
army delivered on feb 27 two days after the election mrs 
castileblanco and her neighbors say the ak47s were distributed to 
anyone age 15 and over 
in matagalpa residents of the pancasan neighborhood told a 
similar story when asked what the guns were for 16yearold jose 
alexis guido gonzalez said if the contra comes or if the uno 
comes to kick on our door we can use these arms against anyone who 
is against us 
sandinista officials say they are arming people against the 
possibility of a contra offensive the rash of desertions from the 
army following the victory of mrs chamorro who promised to 
abolish the despised draft also appears to be a factor 
the opposition has put out a demobilization message said 
carlos zamora the topranking sandinista party official in the 
region if this keeps up the army could end up without 
conscripts

the first summonses went out monday the number issued was not 
immmediately known but one lawyer served said an irs agent told 
him 900 attorneys were to receive summonses demanding their 
financial records 
its very clear what the issue is here it grows out of 
concerns about drug payments said david runkel spokesman for

union officials are counting on some 
republican house members to desert president bush and help override 
his veto of a bill that would have the government intervene in the 
yearold eastern airlines strike 
a house vote was possible this afternoon on bushs veto of a 
measure creating a special panel to investigate and recommend 
possible solutions to the bitter dispute between the carrier and 
8500 mechanics and other ground service workers 
some override supporters said late tuesday they were still at 
least a few votes short of the necessary twothirds majority in the 
435member house to override the republican president others said 
it was too close to call republican help is crucial since the 
chamber has 257 democrats and 175 republicans there are three 
vacancies

roman catholics still believe confession is good 
for the soul but many disagree with their bishops on whether the 
sacrament of penance is a necessary way to reach reconciliation 
with god 
in a survey of bishops and parishioners the church hierarchy 
said the loss of a sense of sin was the top reason for smaller 
lines at church confessionals while the first reason listed by 
laity was that reconciliation was being experienced by other means 
including the sacrament of holy communion 
the differing perspectives were so great that a less pervasive 
sense of sin was only seventh on the laitys list of reasons 
catholics are going to confession less frequently while the idea 
reconciliation is experienced by other means was fifth on the 
bishops list 
for better and worse the sons and daughters of european 
immigrant catholics who once filled confessionals each week have 
become part of the american mainstream said the rev michael j 
walsh executive director of the secretariat for pastoral research 
and practices of the us catholic conference 
what has happened with western culture in general is that the 
anchor in the judeochristian culture has been loosened by 
secularization walsh said 
the study undertaken by the committee for pastoral research and 
practices of the national conference of catholic bishops surveyed 
2500 priests 2850 active lay catholics and about 380 bishops in 
the spring and summer of 1988 the majority of catholics surveyed 
55 percent said they went to confession once or twice a year four 
percent said they went once a week 5 percent said they went 
monthly and 17 percent said every two or three months nineteen 
percent said they never celebrated the sacrament an average of 18 
hours a week is scheduled for confessions in parishes 
the bishops attributed the decline in confessions to a less 
pervasive sense of sin confusion about what is morally right and 
wrong and disagreement with the churchs moral teaching 
the report of the committee on pastoral practices said the 
individualism and religious pluralism in american culture have 
taken a toll on catholics many of whom are no longer willing to 
submit to the claims on human freedom posed by god and others 
while pluralism encourages a perspective that all systems are 
equally valid the bishops committee said its most practical 
consequence however is the creation of an environment of total 
relativism 
the naming confronting repenting and confessing of ones 
sins is never easy amid the cacophony of moral claims it becomes 
even more difficult the committee said 
the issue was viewed differently from the pew with lay 
catholics saying they are experiencing forgiveness by other means 
than confession 
the part that surprised me was the comfortableness with which 
people find reconciliation by other means said bishop john j 
mcraith of the diocese of owensboro ky 
more than 80 percent of the lay respondents said they 
experienced reconciliation by receiving the eucharist other ways 
catholics reported experiencing forgiveness were by personal 
prayer making an act of contrition talking with a friend doing 
charitable works and reading the bible 
the priests surveyed were divided on the issue saying general 
confusion over what is right and wrong and the fact laypeople are 
experiencing forgiveness by other means were the two main reasons 
for the drop in confessions they also said an excessive sense of 
guilt motivated many confessions in the past 
the good news in the survey the bishops committee said was 
that although catholics are going to confession less often the 
quality of those sacramental encounters has improved 
bishops priests and laity all expressed particular satisfaction 
with penance services during which individual confessions are heard 
as part of a liturgical celebration 
people were pleased with the forms of communal penance 
service mcraith said the emphasis was placed on the quality 
of the celebration of the sacrament 
for their part priests requested greater training for their 
role as confessors particularly with regard to the new 
possibilities for moral and spiritual dialogue created by the 
revised rites of penance which offer the option of facetoface 
confessions 
the bishops committee recommended that dioceses give priority 
to training priests and seminarians as confessors 
the committees recommendations for increasing interest in the 
sacrament of penance also included not limiting penance services to 
advent and lent and considering offering confessions at more 
convenient times such as before mass 
confession needs to be different from what it was years 
ago mcraith said

by republican calculation any democrat who 
wants to challenge president bush for the white house in 1992 
should be at work by now piling up primary campaign money at a 
rate of about 25000 a week none is and a gop strategist claims 
that just about concedes bush a second term 
ed rollins acknowledges his is a partisan analysis it is a 
wishful one too with the next presidential election more than 30 
months away as bush has said popularity ratings that soar as 
they have in his case also can plummet 
nevertheless the political circumstances of 1990 may do what 
political reformers long have advocated and abbreviate the 
campaign for the white house the standard campaign plan has been 
based on an early usually undeclared start by a presidential 
candidate especially one running against an incumbent president 
it isnt happening this time 
the prospective challengers all have other things to do in the 
last two elections in which incumbents were unseated the winners 
democrat jimmy carter and four years later republican ronald 
reagan were fulltime campaigners former governors without other 
duties 
with the public opinion polls putting bush at record approval 
ratings running against him doesnt look like an inviting 
assignment at this point that may change the law of political 
gravity will pull the poll ratings down eventually but if bush can 
go into his next campaign at anything even approaching his current 
standing the odds will be long against his challenger 
so a waiting game makes sense for democrats especially those 
with the ambition to run but the option of waiting until 1996 to do 
it and that means most of them 
theres also an increased demand for preseason fund raising in 
1992 with costly california in the process of moving its primary 
election from the end of the schedule to near the beginning that 
means assigning the biggest single bloc of nominating votes in 
march instead of june 
it will send democratic contestants into the most expensive of 
primary campaigns in a state in which jesse jackson gained 35 
percent of the democratic primary vote in 1988 jackson has just 
announced that he wont run for mayor of washington which probably 
means that he will run a third time for the democratic nomination 
the new calendar works in his favor the leadoff states iowa and 
new hampshire are not his territory his 1988 percentages there 
were in single digits but california would quickly eclipse them 
and the southern super tuesday primaries follow that 
that raises the prospect that the democratic nominee would have 
to get around a strengthened jackson trying not to alienate his 
black and liberal constituency and struggling to stay near enough 
to the political center to have a chance against an incumbent 
republican 
rollins cochairman and operational chief of the republican 
congressional campaign committee said we expect at this point 
for george bush to have a tremendous victory democrats are 
almost conceding he told the national association of home 
builders 
the democrats of course say they are doing no such thing 
rollins who managed reagans 1984 reelection campaign said 
that for the first time in years there are no serious candidates 
for president working to round up the people and the money for a 
campaign 
if youre not off and running four years in advance you wont 
have the resources to be a viable candidate for the presidency 
he said and now that theyve moved california up front think 
in terms of the cost 
rollins said a candidate would have to have 2 million to 3 
million committed in advance in order to be a serious contender in 
the california primary and thats only the beginning 
which means if you start right today you have to raise about 
250000 a week every week rollins said so any of you who 
are interested in running for president get started 
at least the slow start will put conventional wisdom to the 
test breaking what has become a pattern of almost permanent 
presidential campaigns

thanks to eugene langs impulsive promise at a 
gradeschool graduation 90 percent of the class of 1981 at east 
harlems ps 121 now has graduated from high school 
half have gone on to bard swarthmore barnard and other 
universities spurred by the millionaires vow to pay the college 
tuition of each of the 61 students if they got high school 
diplomas and around the country others have copied langs 
largesse 
lang doesnt take credit for the inroads made by his young 
proteges their own hard work and dedication brought them this far 
he says but like a proud grandfather he brags about what theyve 
accomplished 
i fully expect twothirds of the class to complete at least 
two years of college he says 
in 1981 he said i asked the principal of the school how many 
of these kids would go to college and he told me maybe one 
the avuncular lang wasnt always so upbeat at a 1985 lunch with 
harlem social worker dorothy stoneman lang recalls bemoaning what 
he saw as a lack of progress smartaleck truants apathetic 
parents uninterested students 
you dont know how to look stoneman interrupted dammit 
gene wake up dont you realize that every one of your kids is 
still in school 
it was true the track record of langs kids was phenomenal in a 
neighborhood where one in every two students drops out 
stonemans dressingdown left the millionaire entrepreneur 
feeling terrific he decided to parlay his impulsive personal 
adventure into a national program the i have a dream foundation 
at latest count 130 sponsors in 32 cities are backing more than 
8000 dreamers 
sponsors range from new york investment banker felix rohatyn to 
presidential nephew james bush others patch together the required 
300000 with contributions from churches civic groups and friends 
the money is deposited in annuity funds operated by the 
foundation and eventually pays tuition at a city or state college 
students eying private schools hustle for scholarships to make up 
the difference 
the college scholarship is the ultimate plum for 
sixthgraders but its not the motivating plum lang said the 
big issue is keeping them in school and encouraging every kid to 
identify a future to have a dream 
problems dogged the original class of dreamers several dropped 
out but most were persuaded to return to school six became 
pregnant one with three children but are expected to receive high 
school diplomas one boy spent time in attica state prison for 
attempted robbery another is at sing sing though he is taking 
college classes at langs behest 
keeping kids on track takes constant attention so lang the 
head of refac corp delegated authority to john rivera a 
neighborhood youth worker 
rivera 27 describes his own high school counseling as five 
minutes and an army recruiting brochure 
as the program coordinator he played nagging parent big 
brother and best friend watching report cards arranging for 
tutors setting up rap sessions and taking students to college 
fairs 
johnny showed me how to take all my negatives and turn them 
into positives said david nieves a sophomore at lower manhattan 
community college math nearly ended high school for him until 
rivera found the right tutor nieves said 
he was the person everyone related to he pulled it all 
together said juan martinez a junior at swarthmore gene lang 
was sort of a faraway figure but through johnny he pulled it all 
together 
rousana serrano an economics major at barnard college planning 
on a career in commercial banking said the key is catching kids 
young before theyre hardened by the street 
you really have to start molding a kids mind early she 
said so that they say what kind of question is that if im 
going to college or not of course i am 
the attitude that school is not cool is the biggest 
obstacle rivera said break that with a little outside help he 
said and east harlem students can and do go anywhere 
these are the same old kids in the same old neighborhood but 
gene injected some outside influence rivera said he isnt a 
knight on a white horse hes a warm human representative from 
south of 96th street we go down fifth avenue and all we see is the 
doorman in the uniform outside and we could never go in 
it brought two vastly different societies together said 
martinez who once was awestruck by the millionaire but now 
prefers to argue about international economics when visiting langs 
midtown office 
to stop recycling the problems of the inner city everyone must 
be included the gifted and the ungifted lang said 
rivera points to a small miracle among the ungifted three 
specialeducation students from the class of 81 armed with their 
high school diplomas and now taking college classes 
this is unheard of he said few specialeducation 
students graduate from high school let alone go on to college 
with so many of the students at college riveras role in the 
program scaled down so he left to pursue a dream of his own hes 
studying sociology at hunter college a junior like the other 
dreamers

the sight of iron mike tyson on the canvas 
and drexel burnham lambert similarly flattened has prompted the 
pundits to proclaim the end of an era the end of the 80s of 
excess 
from the separated trumps to contaminated perrier the evidence 
seems to be all around us 
shearson lehman hutton junk bonds the dow jones average the 
hunt brothers kohlberg kravis rjr nabisco it just seems like 
everyone and everything that used to be riding high are sinking 
fast 
as a matter of fact the sound of the mighty falling is getting 
pretty distracting 
like iron mike they mostly all complain they didnt see it 
coming 
worse the experts herald the end of modern gluttony as we know 
it noting the obvious coincidence of the opening of a new decade 
but these sudden shifts as cataclysmic as they might seem to 
30something eyes are really not the end of anything they might 
be more accurately described as reruns of a very old show which 
aside from titillation provide fresh lessons in a law as undeniable 
as gravity 
since midas perhaps since adam the consequences of risky 
business have been spurned to the peril of those who dare to pursue 
happiness a little too voraciously 
in the vernacular the chickens always come home to roost 
what goes around comes around again and again and again 
anyone who doubts these fundamentals need only look as far as 
the next headline new coke is coming around again for heavens 
sake 
what is so surprising about all these earthshattering events is 
not their occurrence but our reaction our jaws drop at the news 
that tysons brow has been busted by a fellow named douglas and 
that drexel has met a bankruptcycourt fate worse than rudolph 
giuliani 
what is all the fuss about hasnt it always been true that the 
bigger they are the harder they fall 
the case could generally be made could it not that flabbiness 
breeds carelessness whether were talking about prizefighters or 
junkbond underwriters 
yet even those who are 40something 50something 60something 
and beyond seem awestruck by recent events that includes a lot of 
people who saw gene tunney upset jack dempsey and glasssteagall 
break up the morgan dynasty on wall street 
maybe our hearts are leading us astray with the endless 
economic expansion and the fall of communism its hard to imagine 
a war we cant win today 
but the road of american history is littered with blown tires 
if youve read the account of the rjr nabisco fight barbarians 
at the gate by reporters bryan burrough and john helyar move on 
to an even fatter tome now heading for the bookstores called the 
house of morgan by ron chernow 
the reading experience will provide ample proof that henry 
kravis peter cohen and michael milken were not the first 
barbarians to crash wall streets gates the morgan empire grew 
into such a financial behemoth that congress was inspired to 
legislate against it and erect a legal wall between the banking and 
securities businesses so was born the glasssteagall act of 1933 
a little more than half a century later after gargantuan merger 
fees pushed the pendulum all the way back in favor of brokerage 
houses lawmakers began to mull the repeal of glasssteagall 
when they say it just cant happen the champ is invincible the 
deal is airtight or the business is too big to fail think about 
all those previously vanquished barbarians 
the talent for making the same mistake much more than once is 
peculiarly american from celebrity to captain of industry we love 
to demonstrate just how easy it is to abuse the secrets of our 
success

more than a century after the blood of 
hundreds of northwestern shoshones soaked the snowy banks of the 
bear river the federal government may be ready to admit its 
soldiers perpetrated a massacre unrivaled in the annals of the west 
since jan 29 1863 this site 110 miles north of salt lake city 
has been known for the battle of bear river described by col 
patrick connor as a glorious struggle won by classic military 
tactics and superior firepower 
ignored were persistent shoshone claims to the contrary 
survivors recounted connors battle as a day of savagery in 
which soldiers smashed infants skulls raped dying squaws and 
dispatched the wounded with bullets clubs and axes 
connor lost 14 of his 200 men an estimated 270 to 400 shoshones 
died twothirds of them women and children 
edwin c bearss chief historian for the national park service 
says that after extensive study he agrees history should be 
rewritten to reflect the shoshone account 
the attack was sharp sudden and vigorous there were heavy 
casualties he said a good case can be made that there were 
more indian casualties in this attack than any other by us forces 
west of the mississippi 
bear river was much more grim than betterknown indian 
massacres at sand creek in colorado territory where 133 cheyennes 
were killed by troopers nov 28 1864 and at wounded knee sd 
where soldiers slaughtered 153 sioux on dec 28 1890 bearss said 
but any news of the attack was pushed out of most newspapers by 
dispatches from fierce civil war battles that killed tens of 
thousands at fredericksburg va and stones river tenn 
estimates of how many indians died at bear river vary because no 
official count was made tradition has it that connor counted 
bodies from horseback and recorded 220270 dead settlers who went 
in later found many more bodies in ravines or under deep snow and 
put the number as high as 500 the tribe says 400 of their number 
were killed no more than 60 escaped or survived 
on april 3 bearss will recommend that the site just outside 
preston idaho be granted national historic landmark status as the 
bear river massacre if it passes muster with the agencys 
advisory panel the proposal will be sent to interior secretary 
manuel lujan jr probably in may 
as for connors version bearss says history is replete with 
lies or omissions made to paint heroic pictures connor and his 
california volunteers had signed up to fight johnny reb their 
posting to the great basin to protect mormon settlers and keep an 
eye on indians was galling 
attacking an indian village was a poor substitute for 
battlefield glory but it was all the ambitious connor had to 
impress his superiors 
if i was a colonel bearss said it would be to my 
careers benefit if i portrayed bear river as a pitched battle 
as a career soldier youre looking for career success and body 
counts have always been important 
in late january 1863 hundreds of indians had set up tepees at 
bia ogoi or bear river for the warm dance an annual winter 
ritual to drive away the cold 
the night of jan 27 one tribal elder awoke from a nightmarish 
vision the white mans pony soldiers were slaughtering his people 
tin dup convinced this was a warning from the great spirit told 
anyone who would listen to flee 
do it now tonight he begged them 
few left with tin dup most dismissed the gloomy prediction 
which belied a peaceful scene of warm campfires and sleepy 
conversation 
a variety of sources including army reports books and 
carefully preserved tribal oral histories prove tin dup a 
visionary 
just before dawn on jan 29 connors cavalry formed up on 
bluffs towering 200 feet above chief sagwitch timbimboos 
stillsleeping encampment thinned by frostbite from its original 
275 men after a threeday march from utahs fort douglas 110 miles 
to the south the unit had a mission to chastise and 
exterminate indians responsible for recent clashes with whites 
three shoshones had stolen some horses and cattle a few weeks 
before connor also blamed them for the slayings of a miner and two 
settlers the shoshone insisted the killings were the work of other 
indians 
across the bear river sagwitch rose early to watch his camp 
awaken suddenly his eyes were drawn to the eastern hills a 
strange mist was moving down the slopes out of which thundered 
connors soldiers 
even as his startled warriors gathered bows tomahawks and a few 
muskets sagwitch ordered them not to shoot believing the soldiers 
would seek to parley had connor asked for the livestock thieves 
they would have been surrendered according to tribal accounts 
connors belief in the shoshones hostile intent could only have 
been strengthened by mormon scout orrin porter rockwell bodyguard 
of pioneer brigham young rockwell who would watch the bloodshed 
from the safety of the bluffs had told connor that up to 600 
shoshone warriors were battle ready according to a 1985 history 
connor sent his cavalry across the river determined to cut off 
any retreat as the infantry closed in the indians ran for the 
iceclogged river its banks soon were bloody with wounded and 
dead squaws many with infants strapped to their backs joined the 
desperate plunge most drowned others were shot as they swam a 
few escaped 
sagwitch wounded in one hand tumbled into the river and 
floated under some brush after nightfall he and a few warriors 
found ponies and fled north 
back in camp soldiers took babies by the heels and dashed them 
to death squaws helpless from their wounds were raped even as 
they died 
another chief bear hunter endured a savage beating his wife 
beahwaachee who watched from her concealment in nearby 
willows recalled that bear hunter did not cry out even when 
soldiers rammed a heated bayonet through his head ear to ear 
sagwitchs 12yearold grandson yeager timbimboo played dead 
a soldier who discovered him alive raised his musket to the boys 
head three times but couldnt fire 
the trooper walked away leaving the youth to grow old and tell 
a story far different than the account of a pitched battle given by 
soontobe brig gen patrick connor

one who heard his story was his granddaughter mae timbimboo 
parry for parry who has spent much of her 70 years gathering the 
tribes oral history landmark designation of the bear river site 
is long overdue 
ive been telling this story for so long i felt i was like 
the lone ranger she said ill say it was a massacre to my 
dying day 
so will allie hansen president of the bear riverbattle creek 
monument association although that wasnt always the case 
in 1986 her group was behind passage of a resolution by utah 
and idaho legislators that would have erected a battle of bear 
river monument but parry threatened to sue insisting the word 
battle had no place in commemoration of a massacre 
to resolve the dispute sen james mcclure ridaho asked the 
park service to study the attack as part of a landmark application 
the assignment went to bearss a civil war expert 
meantime hansens own research convinced her the indians were 
right a descendant of southern idaho homesteaders she said she 
had been naively kept in the dark 
she also learned to appreciate the tiny tribes intensity about 
the massacre even after all this time to them it is like 
something that just happened hansen said 
perhaps parry said that is because the massacre was the 
tribes holocaust in the 1860s the northwestern shoshone thrived 
following game and the seasons over a range that included eastern 
nevada northern utah southern idaho and wyoming 
today the tribe counts only 350 members 
we have never recovered from the massacre parry said 
weve never quite recovered

editors note while capitalism is slowly gaining ground in the 
struggling marxist nations of africa autocratic rulers are not 
yielding to the kind of political reforms that brought down the 
iron curtain in eastern europe a sudden explosion of democracy on 
this continent is not seen as likely 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

in the face of their own failures and 
the success of the democracy movement in eastern europe many 
african leaders are turning away from the communist economic 
theories with which they greeted independence 
but if they have accepted the need to embrace capitalism fewer 
seem willing to renounce the type of autocratic rule until recently 
practiced by the eastern european and soviet heirs of marx and 
lenin 
perestroika or change has come to africa the openness of 
glasnost trails well behind 
only last monday mengistu haile marian who as president of 
ethiopia has been the soviet unions staunchest ally in africa for 
15 years tossed in the socialist towel and said his country should 
adopt a free market economy 
but like so many other african leaders who have seen a 
capitalist light at the end of a dark economic tunnel mengistu did 
not call for a multiparty system nor did he suggest that his ruling 
marxistleninist party loosen its constitutional grip on a monopoly 
of power 
the great winds carrying democracy that have shaken the 
countries of eastern europe will not shake the coconut trees in 
africa commented the national newspaper of gabon 
most african nations gained their independence from colonial 
rule during the height of the cold war their struggles for freedom 
against western powers sometimes openly abetted and always cheered 
by the soviet union and its allies 
scarred by their colonial experience under britain france 
portugal spain and until the end of world war ii italy and 
germany africas new nations generally opted for the social and 
economic models they found in moscow warsaw and east berlin 
today most of the subsaharan african nations south africa 
being an exception along with senegal mauritius zimbabwe 
botswana and newly free namibia are under military dictatorial 
or oneparty rule marked by authoritarianism a sharp intolerance 
of opposition and presidential terms of office limited only by 
death or revolution 
many are avowedly socialist 
but while showing little inclination to relax their grip on 
power even some of the most marxistoriented governments are 
moving toward economic liberalization in a transformation 
encouraged by one simple fact most aid advice and investment in 
recent years has come not from the crumbling soviet empire but 
from the west 
and that aid totaling more than 11 billion in 1987 is in 
many cases all that has kept the wolf from the door in a region of 
450 million people whose combined gross domestic product of 135 
billion barely equals that of belgium with a population of only 10 
million 
in the past decade some 30 african countries have adopted to 
a greater or lesser degree economic reform programs under the 
guidance of those twin pillars of capitalism the world bank and 
the international monetary fund 
were seeing significant changes for the better throughout the 
continent says john sangueme chief executive of the zimbabwe 
national chamber of commerce recent events in eastern europe 
have certainly helped bring them about even though the process 
here in africa is not nearly as dramatic 
still africas slowness to adopt democratic political reforms 
along with economic changes has been widely lamented both from 
within and without the continent 
the un economic commission for africa in a report last year 
said 
the political context for promoting healthy human development 
has been marred for more than two decades by instability war 
intolerance restrictions on the freedom of individuals and groups 
as well as overconcentrations of power 
more recently jacques pelletier the french development 
minister said africas nations would remain among the worlds 
poorest unless they followed eastern europes lead in embracing 
democracy along with freemarket economies 
added the southern african economist a semimonthly magazine 
published by the sevennation south africa development coordination 
conference in a january editorial 
if the cold war is really ending that can only help to 
concentrate african minds by exposing the irrelevance of much 
current ideology 
some leaders are getting the hint 
in the tiny bankrupt west african nation of benin the ruling 
peoples revolutionary party renounced communism in december and 
promised constitutional reforms this year 
sao tome e principe a tiny island nation off the west coast of 
africa is permitting opposition parties to function for the first 
time this year 
on feb 18 the ruling party in cape verde another former 
portuguese island off the west coast decided to give up its 
monopoly on power and switch to multiparty democracy in elections 
slated for november 
the next day president mathieu kerekou of the tiny bankrupt 
west african nation of benin instructed a conference of government 
ruling party and opposition leaders to draw up a plan for the 
democratization of the country the group took kerekou more 
seriously than he probably intended forcing him 10 days later to 
sobbingly agree to share power with a new prime minister 
in january the ruling workers party of the congo said it was 
creating a commission to consider democratic changes and would 
decide on its future course in june it has ruled as a marxist 
oneparty government since 1979 
mozambique caught in a cruel civil war with rightwing rebels 
dumped marxism as its official policy last july and announced plans 
for multiparty elections this year 
they however are but a fraction of subsahara africas 45 
countries and the more dominant view is expressed by presidents 
such as zimbabwes robert mugabe and gabons omar bongo 
bongo said in january he didnt think most african countries 
would follow eastern europes example and move toward multiparty 
democracies 
just days later as if to prove bongo right mugabes ruling 
party voted to move zimbabwe toward a oneparty marxist state 
further away from the democracy it inherited when it gained 
independence from britain 
and in kenya when a presbyterian minister suggested from the 
pulpit that african leaders should take a cue from eastern europe 
the chairman of the countrys single party termed his suggestion 
sheer madness and folly and called on the church to defrock him 
frederick chiluba the chairmangeneral of zambias congress of 
trade unions mused about the changes in africa in a recent 
interview 
it is unfortunate that africa which began its march to 
independence in the 1950s found the stalinist regime in power 
chiluba said having been colonized by western powers africans 
found sympathy with the stalinist regime and criticism became 
taboo 
but chiluba found some hope 
developments in eastern europe particularly are bound to 
influence man everywhere

on the wall by frank greers office door is a 
doug wilder campaign poster signed by the nations first black 
elected governor with thanks for making this possible 
the space next to the poster greer hopes to fill this year with 
a picture of the nations second black elected governor his client 
and candidate in georgia andrew young 
greer a 43yearold political consultant says wilders 
election last fall was probably one of the most rewarding 
experiences politically and personally in my life 
a white southerner greer adds more than anything else i was 
proud of the south i always thought the south would lead the way 
in race relations 
born and raised in alabama greer designs campaigns for liberal 
and moderate democrats his consulting firm has 15 million in 
billings a year from a pennsylvania avenue office overlooking the 
potomac river 
greer is widely regarded as the hot consultant this campaign 
season in part thats on the strength of wilders 1989 campaign 
its groundbreaking use of abortion rights as an issue and tough 
rapid responses that defused his opponents attacks 
it was brilliant said republican consultant roger stone 
he sold abortion as a conservative position 
wilder may have won only narrowly but a win is a win and 
others already are copying his methods 
as a result greer finds himself at the center of the two most 
significant political developments of the postreagan era the 
election of blacks to statewide office and the power of abortion as 
an issue 
another republican consultant eddie mahe also praised greers 
work for wilder but cautioned that greer may be following a risky 
course he clearly believes the future is prochoice mahe 
said hes putting all his chips on that 
greer gained the notice of his colleagues in 1986 when three 
democratic senate challengers he was handling each won upsets 
brock adams in washington kent conrad in north dakota and wyche 
fowler in georgia 
hed worked for some losers fred harriss 1976 presidential 
campaign walter mondales in 1984 in between he was the labor 
departments spokesman in the carter administration 
his firm greer margolis mitchell and associates also helped 
democrtic forces in a 1988 plebiscite in chile that defeated gen 
augusto pinochet 
greer has another important client the national abortion rights 
action league 
on the day last summer when the supreme court ruled that states 
could impose some limits on abortion greer had tv ads ready that 
night naral began airing them in selected cities trumpeting 
abortion rights as the issue to come 
the work coincided with wilders decision to base his campaign 
in large part on abortion rights before candidates who supported 
abortion rights had done their best to avoid public debate 
regarding the influence of abortion opponents as too great 
greers clients this year include young the former mayor of 
atlanta and veteran of the civil rights struggle who is running in 
the democratic primary for governor of georgia 
young faces longer odds that did wilder greer acknowledges one 
big reason is that georgia law requires a candidate to have 50 
percent of the vote in a primary or runoff to secure the nomination 
long an obstacle for blacks in southern states 
his other candidates this year include senate challenger harvey 
sloane in kentucky montana sen max baucus and paul hubbert a 
candidate for governor in alabama 
what greer has done so far and his clients hope he will 
continue is to find a way to victory for democrats whom some might 
conclude were more liberal than the voters electing them 
more progressive greer prefers 
that is what we do he said i think we do it fairly well 
its what i grew up with in alabama in terms of the legacy of 
franklin roosevelt and the grassroots populism of southerners 
one measure of greers success came recently in kentucky 
republican sen mitch mcconnells reelection campaign went on the 
attack not against sloane the challenger but greer the 
consultant calling him a master of misleading advertising 
earlier sloane had switched positions and now supports abortion 
rights greer says he didnt force or prompt the change 
i dont have a litmus test greer said i let them make 
that decision 
in wilders campaign greer designed ads that presented abortion 
as an issue of civil liberties a question of who decides the 
government or the woman greer used lots of waving flags and 
pictures of virginias thomas jefferson 
greer says it was his success with fowlers georgia campaign 
not wilders that prompted young to hire him 
already though there are echoes of wilders approach in 
youngs campaign 
young announcing his candidacy said abortion is a womans 
decision i would rather trust the women of georgia young 
said sounding a lot like doug wilders i trust the women of 
virginia 
framed that way greer argues support for legal abortions is a 
powerful wedge that democrats can use to divide republicans and win 
back voters who were attracted to the gop on economic issues 
republicans dismiss that as wishful thinking but greer argues 
it goes even further too in symbolism 
its a very much an age issue he said thats why lee 
atwater the republican naitonal chairman is scrambling 
i think the democratic party is perfectly positioned to raise 
the issue and use it to win back younger voters he said it 
symbolizes compassion concern about day care issues of concern to 
working families the question is what the republicans do 
right now theyre positioned on the wrong side of the issue the 
wrong side of history

parched for perrier the us importer of the 
sparkling water that became a status symbol in the 1980s and the 
object of a worldwide contamination recall to start the 1990s says 
relief is a month or more away 
newly bottled perrier bearing a special marking is being shipped 
for the first time since last months recall source perrier sa 
officials said tuesday 
meantime perrier group of america plans to launch a 25 million 
marketing campaign starting today with advertisements in 22 
newspapers in an effort to keep the brands name before the public 
during shipment and to rebuild sales of what had been the 
topselling imported bottled water once it arrives 
the new bottles are expected to reach shelves in the eastern 
united states early next month and the rest of the country within 
three months 
they will carry the mark nouvelle production on the label to 
distinguish them from the 160 million bottles pulled off the market 
last month 
source perrier said tuesday in paris that shipments to 
distributors resume today but perrier group officials said it will 
take until early april for the bottles to travel overseas pass 
through customs and be distributed to the more than 1 million us 
outlets from supermarkets to bars where perrier is sold 
perrier worth waiting for is the theme of ads slated to 
appear today in usa today the wall street journal and 20 major 
market newspapers 
perrier also plans a series of humorous radio ads in the 15 
largest us markets featuring actors posing as newscasters for 
the perrier news network reporting on perrier sightings 
in one ad fictional correspondent jill purity interviews a man 
who had spotted a bottle of perrier jill notes the bottle is 
missing and the man explains that elvis presley came and drank it 
ronald v davis president and chief executive of greenwich 
connbased perrier group told reporters at the french consulate 
that humor was appropriate because no one was hurt and no 
health risk was posed by the contamination incident 
perrier was recalled feb 9 in the united states after traces of 
benzene a cancercausing chemical were found in some perrier 
bottles the recall was broadened five days later to all 160 
million bottles in 120 countries when contaminated bottles showed 
up in several other countries 
company officials claim the benzene a naturally occurring gas 
that dissolves in water entered perriers bottling line when 
workers failed to replace a filter used to screen impurities from 
the carbon dioxide gas that is mixed with the water to provide more 
fizz 
they said new quality control procedures have been installed at 
the plant in vergeze including double filtration of the gas and 
more careful monitoring 
perrier should start appearing on shelves in new york in early 
april davis said and across the country within three months he 
said it may take until the end of the summer to get all perrier 
varieties back in full distribution 
an ad campaign to be used after the relaunch is being developed 
by hal riney amp partners a san franciscobased ad agency that 
created the old its perfect its perrier campaign davis said 
no decisions have been made on using that slogan again 
hellen berry market research director for the industry 
consultant beverage marketing corp said i suspect the consumer 
will come back to them 
perriers davis said consumer surveys the company has taken 
indicate 95 percent of perrier users feel the company acted 
responsibly in ordering the recall and 84 percent plan to purchase 
it in the future 
he said he could not estimate the costs of the recall in the 
united states 
but he said the perrier brand would have sold about 30 million 
in the months that it will be off the shelf or in limited supply 
offsetting that however would be gains in sales of perrier 
groups other brands including arrowhead poland spring and 
calistoga 
davis said at least 50 percent of perrier brands shelf space in 
major markets is being filled by other perrier group brands 
the perrier brand was the third bestselling bottled water brand 
and the topselling imported water in the united states in 1988 
accounting for about 57 percent of the 22 billion in 
industrywide sales according to beverage marketing 
davis said the perrier brand accounted for about 119 million in 
sales in 1989 or about 19 percent of perrier groups estimated 
640 million in sales

didnt like new coke try coke ii the taste 
promises to be the same 
the cocacola co which learned the hard way about consumer 
loyalty when it changed the formula of coke five years ago 
apparently isnt worried about tinkering with the product that 
replaced it 
the company said tuesday it will try changing the name of new 
coke to coke ii in an attempt to bolster sales of the product that 
in 1985 replaced the worlds bestselling soft drink and sparked a 
consumer revolt 
randy donaldson spokesman for atlantabased coke said the 
formula of new coke will not be altered and that no changes are 
planned for cocacola classic the name for the restored original 
formula 
donaldson said coke ii will be test marketed initially in one 
city which he would not identify 
after five years new coke is no longer new though its still 
called new coke he said we just want to make it easier to 
distinguish between coke ii and coke classic 
soft drink industry analysts speculated that if the change to 
coke ii is adopted the brand name cocacola could be returned to 
the bestselling coke classic coke officials denied such a name 
change was being considered 
jesse meyers who publishes the greenwich conn industry 
newsletter beverage digest said the coke ii test meant cocacola 
was taking off the gloves in its cola war with rival pepsi cola 
theyve had a nambypamby approach to new coke vs pepsi 
meyers said theyre going from nambypamby to the machine guns 
recent coke advertising has pitted diet coke rather than the 
sugared new coke or cocacola classic against pepsi meyers said 
the coke ii test indicates a plan to match the newer product 
against pepsi cola 
meyers said the proposed packaging for coke ii has a red white 
and blue design with blue lettering that closely resembles that of 
pepsi but donaldson said that unlike pepsi the coke ii can has a 
red background with white letters and a blue outline 
cocacola announced in april 1985 that after extensive taste 
tests it was changing the formula of coke the worlds bestselling 
soft drink consumer reaction was so strong against the new product 
that the company two months later apologized and brought back the 
original formula under the name cocacola classic 
coke classic regained the position as the no 1 soft drink the 
sweetertasting new coke also remained but its market share now is 
14 percent compared to coke classics 20 percent 
secondranked pepsi had an 183 percent market share according 
to beverage digests 1989 yearend figures 
emanuel goldman who follows the soft drink industry for 
painewebber inc in san francisco said the coke ii label if 
chosen would remove the perception that new coke is a failure 
you dont want something called cocacola that doesnt work 
so you call it coke ii goldman said i think its not such a 
bad thing to do the name of the game is cocacola 
meyers said the proposed changes could lead the company to 
change coke classic back to cocacola the name coke classic may 
be on the way out he said 
donaldson said the change to coke ii would not leave the company 
without a product called simply cocacola he said the company had 
several products incorporating the name 
pepsi spokesman tod mackenzie said cokes socalled 
megabrand concept could backfire 
it raises some questions in our minds at what point does 
this megabrand confuse consumers mackenzie said how does the 
consumer keep track 
pepsi has maintained that new coke was an attempt to make a 
drink that tastes more like pepsi cola whether its coke ii or 
new new coke its another validation of cokes interest in the 
great taste of pepsi mackenzie said from pepsi headquarters in 
purchase ny

their currency is named for the sun but with 
inflation of nearly 3000 percent last year peruvians got little 
warmth from it 
the first truck i bought 15 years ago cost me 10 million 
soles now that wont even buy me a pack of cigarettes said 
miguel guzman who owns a trucking company in lima 
guzman quoted prices in the old currency the sol spanish for 
sun 
in 1986 when the sol had fallen to 14000 to the dollar the 
government lopped off three zeros and renamed it the inti sun in 
quechua the indian language spoken by nearly half the population 
four years later a dollar buys 14000 intis which means it 
would buy 14 million soles if they were still around 
to peruvians like nearly everyone else jokes are spiritual 
life preservers against disaster the latest one in lima is that 
the government will chop off three zeros again and call its money 
the lupaca sun in aymara perus second major indian language 
the inflation rate for the past year which meant prices ended 
the year 30 times higher on average than 12 months earlier was 
surpassed only by argentinas 4924 percent 
doris mandujano 27 one of three daughters in a workingclass 
family of 16 including grandchildren says the last year has 
brought fundamental changes in the way they live 
sometimes at dinner there isnt enough food to go around 
she said we used to have milk and marmalade for breakfast now 
its bread and oatmeal weve given up trying to provide clothing 
and medicine for everyone 
her family is squeezed into a threebedroom cementblock house 
miss mandujanos father built in villa el salvador a shantytown on 
the outskirts of lima 
miss mandujanos parents and seven of the children including 
herself have jobs and contribute to meeting the familys needs 
she has the additional job of trying to make and follow a budget 
our pay doesnt keep up with prices she said sometimes 
by the fourth day of the month weve already spent what was 
budgeted for two weeks and so the crisis begins 
most economists blame government policies that favored 
consumption over production while creating a huge deficit that fed 
inflation 
they say populist president alan garcias administration has 
subsidized basic goods and services to the point of bankrupting the 
very state companies that provide the services 
a gallon of gasoline costs the equivalent of only 40 cents but 
the state oil company petroperu is on the verge of bankruptcy 
electricity and water are among the worlds cheapest but both 
are rationed to limas 7 milliion people largely because of the 
dilapidated systems some parts of the city have been without water 
for weeks 
ernesto amans president of the state water company said nearly 
half the water leaving treatment plants was lost through leaking 
underground mains and the company could not afford the 18 million 
needed for repairs 
while subsidized prices remain low food and clothing rose more 
than 2500 percent last year entertainment soared more than 10000 
percent and education nearly 20000 percent according to official 
statistics 
the magazine analisis laboral predicts that by the time garcia 
leaves office july 28 accumulated inflation during his fiveyear 
term will reach 1383120 percent 
novelist mario vargas llosa is favored to win the april 8 
presidential election as the candidate of a centerright coalition 
he has pledged to reduce annual inflation to 10 percent within a 
year but says it will demand great sacrifice 
after five years of garcia who campaigned as the president of 
hope and won by a landslide many peruvians are skeptical of 
politicians promises 
all thats left to believe in is ourselves miss mandujano

eastern airlines has asked a federal bankruptcy 
judge to accelerate approval of a 280 million payment by its 
parent texas air corp to settle claims that texas air had drained 
assets from eastern 
eastern president phil bakes said tuesday the airline made the 
request because news reports about the settlement had wrongly 
suggested eastern was plundered and duped by texas air creating a 
bad image in the industry and flying public 
bakes told a news conference that quick approval by the court 
would help clarify the settlement 
a report by courtappointed examiner david i shapiro filed last 
week suggested texas air had victimized eastern by underpaying for 
the airline and some assets by hundreds of millions of dollars 
eastern and texas air denounced the report partly because it 
appeared to vindicate longstanding claims by eastern unions which 
struck the airline last march eastern sought bankruptcy protection 
a few days later 
the pilots and flight attendants quit the strike in november but 
union hostility to eastern and texas air remains strong 
in response to easterns request for the accelerated settlement 
with texas air air line pilots association spokesman don skiados 
said were all for that we know their arguments cant hold up 
under the light of day 
a hearing on the settlement has been set for april 6 before us 
bankruptcy judge burton r lifland in new york normally approval 
wouldnt occur until easterns final bankruptcy reorganization plan 
was confirmed by the court 
shapiro disclosed the settlement last thursday the same day he 
filed with the court his extensive report on financial dealings 
between texas air eastern and sister carrier continental airlines 
bakes said the report had left a most most unfortunate 
impression that could negatively affect easterns relationships 
with travel agents suppliers and the flying public 
he said the settlement between texas air and shapiro has been 
misinterpreted by the news media as an admission of wrongdoing by 
texas air for the asset purchases texas air agreed to make the 
payment to eastern only to bolster the airline he said 
bakes was accompanied by five outside directors of eastern who 
each made brief statements reinforcing the companys position 
the report disturbed me as a director and even more so as a 
lawyer said thomas hale boggs jr to imply as the report 
does that we eastern directors sort of rubberstamped these 
actions is erroneous 
in a similar move monday shapiro told congressional leaders his 
report had been misinterpreted by the media as a finding that texas 
air was liable for the money 
i did not find that texas air had improperly diverted assets 
from eastern shapiro wrote in a letter to house speaker thomas 
s foley and house minority leader robert h michel instead i 
set forth the grounds on which such a claim could be asserted 
the settlement is not an admission of liability by texas 
air the letter read rather it is an agreement between texas 
air and the examiner as to what is needed to assure the economic 
viability of eastern airlines

the head of a securities industry group says 
government regulators were right in not stepping in to save drexel 
burnham lambert inc 
investment banker robert n downey told a senate panel tuesday 
that drexels failure reflects how selfreliant the industry is 
compared to the multibilliondollar government bailout of the 
savings and loan industry 
downey told the finance subcommittee of the senate banking 
housing and urban affairs committee that when drexel no longer 
could stand on its own it collapsed the government did not rush 
in to save it nor should it have 
drexels parent company drexel burnham lambert group inc 
filed for bankruptcy code protection from creditors last month 
after defaulting on 100 million in shortterm loans and failing to 
secure additional financing 
drexel group listed more than 2000 creditors and nearly 3 
billion in liabilities 
drexels fall marked the largest securities industry bankruptcy 
filing ever and one of the first exceptions to a longheld but 
unwritten regulatory policy that some institutions are just to big 
to be allowed to fail 
downey a partner in the investment banking firm goldman sachs 
amp co put in a plug for a plan still being developed by the sia 
to allow commercial banking organizations to enter the securities 
industry and securities firms to enter consumer banking 
he said the plan would stand without forcing the deposit 
insurance system to shoulder the securities risks and without 
triggering toobigtofail status that led to the saving and 
loan bailout 
downey was among a panel of securities industry leaders 
testifying about the health and future of their industry in the 
wake of drexels demise the collapse of the junk bond market and a 
stock market plunge last october 
the panelists included john h gutfreund chairman of salomon 
inc philip j purcell chairman of dean witter financial services 
group and w lucas simons jr managing partner of jc bradford amp 
co of nashville tenn 
all four called for a single federal agency to regulate all 
aspects of the securities industry rather than the current division 
of power now among the federal reserve board securities and 
exchange commission and commodity futures trading commission 
while gutfreund wasnt specific the others said the sec should 
take up the superregulator role 
the sec should then regulate both equity and stock index 
futures markets with a recommendation that its first order of 
business be devoted to rationalizing margin requirements said 
simons of jc bradford an investment banking partnership 
concentrating on the southeast 
margins the amount of money investors must put down to buy 
securities or futures contracts on credit are much lower in the 
futures industry than in stocks critics say that encourages 
speculation in stock options through index arbitrage leading to 
sharp ups and downs in stock prices

regulating a securities firm like drexel 
burnham lambert inc without financial data on its parent company 
is like being a doctor who can only examine part of the body the 
head of the securities and exchange commission said 
sec chairman richard c breeden used a budget hearing before the 
commerce subcommittee of the senate appropriations committee on 
tuesday as an opportunity to lobby for additional authority 
questioned about the recent collapse of drexel breeden said one 
difficulty for the sec was lack of data about the parent holding 
company which filed for bankruptcy code protection last month 
the sec regulates brokerdealers but not their parent companies 
which dont have to disclose their financial status 
legislation pending in both the house and senate would give the 
sec access to such financial data 
breeden likened the limitations on such information to being a 
physician who can only look at the right arm from the elbow to 
the wrist its very unrealistic 
the bush administration is seeking 1924 million for the sec in 
1991 a 14 percent increase over the 1990 appropriation of 1687 
million 
breeden noted that congress should be mindful that sec revenue 
production through filing fees have significantly exceeded its 
appropriations 
he pointed out that in 1989 while receiving only 1426 million 
in appropriations the sec generated 2138 million in fees

the lead creditor to drexel burnham lambert 
group inc withdrew a request for a courtappointed examiner in the 
bankruptcy case as the two sides neared a deal on who will manage 
dissolution of the wall street firm 
the firm and its creditors negotiated over a proposal to allow a 
triumvirate of drexel board members to oversee the firm with input 
from creditors as it liquidates under chapter 11 bankruptcy 
proceedings 
the move tuesday by lead creditor first city bancorp of texas 
to withdraw its request for an examiner was a sign the drexel board 
members were likely to continue directing the liquidation 
creditors had sought an examiner in the case because of concerns 
about the rapid liquidation of billions of dollars in securities 
holdings and other assets by drexel burnham lambert inc the 
brokerage subsidiary 
the brokerage firm is not subject to bankruptcy court 
proceedings but the asset sales the movement of capital from the 
subsidiary to the parent company prior to the collapse and other 
links prompted anxious creditors to seek an examiner 
in a bid to prevent the appointment which drexel officials 
contended would hamstring the companys daytoday management 
drexel asked us district judge howard buschman iii to allow three 
board members led by chairman john sr shad to oversee the 
dismantling of the parent and all subsidiaries 
drexel attorney alan miller told buschman the two sides had made 
considerable progress toward resolving the issue but he said 
unanticipated differences arose during tuesdays negotiations 
miller and other attorneys refused to disclose the nature of the 
stumbling block 
buschman postponed a hearing on the appointment of the drexel 
board members until friday buschman has said such an arrangement 
would not require court approval 
an individual involved in the talks said that under a plan being 
discussed the threemember drexel team would manage the 
liquidation but give creditors real input into the process 
drexel already has sold off more than 85 percent of its 
portfolio of about 47 billion in securities since the parent filed 
for bankruptcy protection from creditors feb 13 
but the firm still is trying to dispose of most of its 11 
billion in highyield bonds which could take months because of a 
downturn in the market and the risky financial state of many of the 
companies for which drexel issued and now owns junk bonds 
the individual who asked not to be named said drexel 
management would handle transactions and creditors could attend 
senior level meetings and have the ability to scream if they see 
something they dont like 
responsibilities of the oversight panel would apply to the 
parent and the subsidiaries the individual said lawyers said in 
court they would continue meeting on the matter 
the threemember panel consists of shad who is a former sec 
chairman roderick hills a washington lawyer and former sec 
chairman and ralph saul a business executive and former american 
stock exchange president 
the group was named as an outside oversight committee to drexel 
as part of the firms agreement with the securities and exchange 
commission last april settling wideranging securities fraud charges

kidder peabody amp co lost 23 million in 1989 
its parent general electric co reported in another sign of wall 
streets troubles 
the loss at the firm compared with a 46 million profit in 1988 
like other wall street firms kidder has suffered because of a 
decline in stock market and investment banking activity 
a general electric spokesman said tuesday that kidder reported 
an operating loss of 53 million last year but that its net loss 
was lower because of accounting adjustments by ge 
kidders financial performance improved in the last half of 
the year from the first six months ge said in a statement 
kidders streamlined management team is making progress in a 
difficult environment 
kidder is not required to disclose its earnings because it is a 
subsidiary company but figures on its performance were included in 
ges annual report 
kidders 53 million pretax operating loss compared to an 
operating profit of 64 million in 1988 and a loss of 23 million 
in 1987 when the stock market crash wreaked havoc on the 
securities industry 
kidder had revenue of 29 billion in 1989 up from 23 billion 
a year earlier but revenue from investment banking fees and 
brokerage commissions declined 17 percent to 518 million last 
year nearly 30 percent lower than in 1987 
the securities firm was the only segment of ges business to 
show an operating loss last year overall ge had pretax earnings 
of 57 billion in 1989 
ge the electrical products broadcasting and financial services 
company based in fairchild conn paid 600 million to acquire an 
80 percent stake in kidder in 1986 
but kidder has proven costly to ge since its acquisition above 
and beyond its operating losses about a year after buying kidder 
ge paid 26 million to the securities and exchange commission to 
settle insider trading charges involving the firm 
kidder underwent a major restructuring shortly after the crash 
laying off employees and cutting expenses the firm recently has 
been focusing its retail brokerage business on wealthy clients and 
small companies rather then all individual investors 
kidder has 5600 employees down from a peak of 7500

conference tuesday with the aid of baseball great jim palmer who 
is perhaps the bestknown jockey model 
rockefeller according to material provided by his public 
relations agency has a recent penchant for art he has 
collaborated on collages with mark kostabi a new york artist who 
has mounted public relations stunts to promote his artworks 
rockefeller said jockey came to him with the idea of posing for 
the ads 
i kind of hemmed and hawed he said in an interview i 
really wanted to do it but then i thought is my grandfather going 
to kill me or cut me off or something but i eventually decided to 
do it im just sort of winging it 
he said his grandfather james stillman rockefeller former 
chairman of first national city bank of new york opposed the plan 
until the younger rockefeller said he would give the proceeds to 
memorialsloan kettering hospital a family charity 
in some ways i am trying to create my own identity 
rockefeller said sometimes its hard if youre the son of or 
descendant of youre expected to play a certain role

wearing jockey underwear since he was 14

rockefellers are employed 
weve have a much stronger work ethic than a lot of our 
cousins on the other side of the family do out of necessity and

de beers consolidated mines ltd plans to split 
its foreign operations from its south african business in an 
apparent move to shelter the huge diamond mining company from 
political turmoil in south african 
de beers said tuesday the plans were intended to focus attention 
on the companys international nature and its true business value 
basically its going to lose some if not all of the discount 
of being a south african share said rob davies a mining analyst 
at shearson lehman hutton international in london 
de beers also announced its net profit soared 37 percent last 
year 
chairman julian ogilvie thompson denied there were political 
reasons for the companys split 
speaking at a johannesburg news conference that was relayed to 
london he said the split would give de beers better access to 
international capital markets enable shareholders to better 
identify earnings dividends and assets attributable to the south 
african and foreign sides of the business and allow the two sides 
to develop their businesses better 
analysts said the move would insulate the company which in 
1989 made 80 percent of its profit from foreign businesses from 
its south african ties and from moves to end whiteminority rule in 
that country 
the african national congress party has said it would 
nationalize south africas mines and other major sectors of the 
economy if it comes into power 
furthermore many investors are reluctant to invest in south 
african companies because of its government policies of racial 
separation in the united states government sanctions prohibit 
americans from making fresh investments in south african equities 
it should open up the share to a wider market davies said 
of the de beers plan 
ogilvie thompson also denied that the plan was linked to minorco 
sas failed hostile takeover bid for the british mining company 
consolidated gold fields plc last year 
the bid by minorco which is controlled by de beers and the 
associated anglo american corp was seen as an attempt by south 
africas oppenheimer family to diversify its gold and diamond 
mining empire further outside south africa 
under the proposed split de beers south african company will 
continue to be called de beers consolidated mines de beers 
foreign businesses would be grouped under a swiss company de beers 
centenary ag although both companies will be headed by the same 
board of directors 
de beers said it would give existing shareholders one share in 
centenary for each de beers share they own the two shares will be 
tradeable only as a single unit on the nine exchanges where de 
beers shares are traded the company said 
de beers said it would retain a 95 percent stake in centenary 
john taylor an analyst at the london investment firm james 
capel and co said essentially its an extremely cheap share 
people were giving it a low rating because of the politics of 
investing in south africa 
the split means the political risk to a certain extent has 
disappeared taylor said de beers can just allow shares in the 
companies to trade separately if the situation in south africa 
deteriorates he said 
the plan is subject to final approval by south african 
regulators who have approved in principle it also must be 
approved by shareholders support already has been given by anglo 
american which has a 33 percent stake and de beers botswana 
mining co pty ltd which holds 5 percent

mgmua communications co said today it has 
agreed to be acquired by pathe communications corp for 20 a 
share or about 1 billion 
pathe an international film producer distributor and 
exhibitor will begin a tender offer for all of mgmuas common and 
preferred shares within five days the companies said in a joint 
statement 
the deal is expected to be completed in late june 
mgmuas principal shareholder tracinda corp has agreed to 
tender to pathe all of its mgmua shares the statement said 
pathe which will operate mgmua separately agreed to put up 
100 million in earnest money within the next few days mgmua 
chairman jeffrey c barbakow will retain his position 
europebased pathe also granted mgmua certain distribution 
rights and an interest in up to 75 million of net distribution 
proceeds of certain motion pictures further details were not 
disclosed 
we believe that mgmuas unique library and strong 
distribution capabilities complement pathes existing business 
worldwide said giancarlo parretti president and chief executive 
officer of pathe 
we are confident the transaction will result in a strong dual 
company structure which will be strongly competitive in the 
industry he said 
barbakow said the deal allows mgmua employees to continue 
their efforts to build our film tv and home video operations 
he said mgmua will also benefit from pathes control of over 
1000 theater screens in europe and its ownership of an extensive 
library of 1200 feature films including cannons wellknown 
library 
on monday the companies announced that mgmua had reached a 
fiveyear deal to distribute films from pathe mgmua said the deal 
would boost the number of major films it releases in theaters to at 
least 15 this year 
mgmua virtually shut down its film production efforts for 
nearly two years while controlling shareholder kirk kerkorian 
looked for a buyer it has started up its own production again but 
has depended largely on distributing movies from independent 
production companies like pathe 
australias qintex group outbid rupert murdochs fox studio for 
mgmua last year but the deal collapsed when qintex failed to line 
up financing merger talks with cable tv baron ted turner ended in 
january and kerkorian said he would go back to the business of 
making movies

japans sony corp said wednesday it soon will 
begin selling a small keyboardless computer that can read words 
written with a special pen on its flat screen 
we consider this an epochmaking product like the walkman 
tape player a sony official said 
sony officials said the 28pound booksize computer has the 
same screen resolution or clarity of detail as apple computer 
incs macintosh computer it comes with builtin software that 
displays a row of easily recognizable symbols on the screen like a 
macintosh and has extensive graphic capabilities 
this is a real computer but unlike other computers anyone 
can begin using it the minute they take it home said another 
sony official who also spoke on condition of anonymity 
instead of a mouse the handoperated device that manipulates 
the cursor on the screen and executes commands with a push button 
the computer is equipped with a special pen that is used to point 
to the desired function diagram on the builtin flat screen which 
folds open to create a writing surface 
similar pens that emit a light beam have been used for years 
with larger computers but the sony computer named the palmtop 
pct500 takes the pen concept a step further 
in word processing the pen is used to write text on the screen 
which the computer recognizes through a handwriting recognition 
system that uses fuzzy logic sony said 
the computer is capable of recognizing english letters and more 
than 3500 complex japanese characters the company said 
fuzzy logic allows computers to reason more like humans 
instead of being limited to yes or no answers the computer can 
process information like shorter or wider 
the computer has a 16bit processor and 320 kilobytes of 
builtin ram memory which can store about 110 pages of 
information sony said additional memory cards will be available 
with an optional adaptor the pct500 can send and receive fax 
messages to any fax machine a funtion available on many other 
computers sony said the computer also comes with a builtin auto 
phone dialer and can digitally record up to eight seconds of sound 
in addition it has a standard computer interface 
sony said the computer will be introduced in japan on april 1 
for 198000 yen the equivalent of 1320 at current exchange rates 
we plan to sell it overseas but the current software is 
written entirely in japanese so we need to develop a new software 
system for the foreign market an official said

nearly two years after the roof ripped off an 
aging boeing 737 jetliner over hawaii the government is imposing 
the first set of partsreplacement rules for older planes 
at the same time the federal aviation administration announced 
plans worked out with the aviation industry to require a detailed 
cycle of inspections for corrosion in boeing airliners 
the final rules announced tuesday are aimed at correcting 
metalfatigue problems in airliners that have gone through 
thousands of takeoffs and landings they require replacements of 
parts and will cost airlines an estimated 142 million over the 
next four years 
the anticorrosion measures are estimated to cost 38720 for 
each boeing 737 over the sixyear inspection cycle 80000 for 
each boeing 727 80640 for each boeing 707 and 188800 for each 
boeing 747 
foreign regulatory agencies generally follow faa requirements 
for usbuilt planes 
the rules come as no surprise to the industry which set up the 
task force that proposed them 
the aging airliner effort was started after the roof of an aloha 
airlines 737 ripped off at 24000 feet over maui hawaii in april 
1988 a flight attendant was swept to her death and 64 passengers 
were injured the plane was 19 years old and had made nearly 90000 
flights 
the accident was caused primarily by metal fatigue but 
corrosion also was found the faa said 
the new fatigue rules which take effect in 30 days give 
airlines four years to comply with all the requirements and will 
immediately affect 115 older usregistered boeing aircraft 
tony broderick faa regulations chief said the agency believes 
that if the regulations are followed there will be no need to 
retire airliners at a given age 
final fatigue rules for mcdonnell douglas airliners are to be 
issued in a couple of months with rules for other airliners to be 
issued before the end of the year broderick said 
corrosion rules also will be proposed for other jetliners he 
said and will become final after airlines have an opportunity to 
comment 
broderick said that although most airlines have programs to 
detect and repair corrosion the proposed rules would impose 
detailed faa requirements for inspections of 19 specific areas of 
each airliner 
under the proposal inspections would have to be performed most 
often under lavatories and galleys where corrosive liquids might 
collect and in wheel wells 
broderick said the program could pose a relatively big 
burden on some small airlines but that if carriers find 
themselves overburdened it probably means they have not been 
conducting adequate corrosion inspections on their own 
the goal is for each airline to set up a program that will find 
only harmless corrosion that can be corrected quickly with each 
inspection 
more serious corrosion which would require repair or 
replacement of parts or which might endanger the safety of the 
airliner would have to be reported to the manufacturer 
the faa has based its rules on boeing service bulletins and the 
experiences of domestic and foreign airliners that participated in 
the task force

the united states has 70 percent of the 
worlds computer software market but could lose its lead without 
better legal protection as other countries develop their software 
a congressional study says 
with continued innovation the united states can keep outshining 
its foreign competitors the congressional office of technology 
assessment said in a study released today 
it said intellectual property protection encourages innovation 
by providing incentives for creation and security for investors 
last year software and related services were a 60 billion 
industry in the united states software refers to sets of 
instructions for computers whether they are stored in punched 
cards magnetic tape disks or on chips the term can encompass 
data as well as programs 
mitchell d kapor the creator of lotus 123 told a house 
subcommittee that overprotection of software is as pernicious as 
underprotection in its stifling effects on innovation 
he said his industry has made an unsteady but stubborn march 
to extend copyright protection of computer software but he said 
it is possible to go too far 
i honestly believe that this industry isnt mature enough to 
cope with a barrage of new laws kapor said congress could 
help both the software industry and its customers if when it 
passes laws their legislative histories tell the courts that when 
they consider a copyright case they should err on the side of 
innovation over protection 
the software publishers association a worldwide trade 
association representing 575 microcomputer software developers and 
publishers said in a statement that patent protection for their 
product is not universally endorsed partly because publishers are 
concerned that the governments patent and trademark office cant 
adequately review applications 
publishers believe that the pto is understaffed underfunded 
and so is not equipped to evaluate most software patent 
applications in a timely and effective fashion the association 
said 
there is fear of foreign competition especially from the 
japanese who reportedly plan to spend 125 billion over 10 years 
for programming research and development especially in the field 
of artificial intelligence where the goal is to make computers 
think more like humans 
the congressional study said there are basic questions about 
providing too much as well as too little legal protection for 
software 
new technologies have long challenged existing protections but 
usually accommodations are made 
for instance the first copyright statute dealt only with 
maps charts and books but copyright has been able to deal with 
hard questions posed by works like engravings musical 
compositions photographs the study said 
with software however the items needing protection are not 
clear 
as writing and checking lines of program instructions 
socalled code becomes more automated some software producers 
want to protect the logic and idea of a program not just the 
effort required to write the code and check it others worry that 
computeraided software development will make copying easier to 
disguise 
the study says drawing the line between derivative works and new 
creations and determining authorship is likely to become more 
difficult 
but it also points out that lawyers and many in the software 
industry believe existing copyrights and patents adequately protect 
software 
at the same time that some are calling for major revisions in 
software protection says the study others are arguing that 
the current system is not broken and does not need fixing or at 
least can be finetuned within the existing framework

president bush promised today to work toward 
helping the us electronics industry regain and retain its 
lost leadership in world markets 
the president speaking to the american electronics association 
proposed no new trade strategies but said congressional enactment 
of many of his lanquishing initiatives would help make us 
hightech goods more competitive 
without passage of his proposed reduction in the capital gains 
tax rate every business in america of every size is at a 
competitive disadvantage abroad bush said in prepared remarks 
he said some of the nations biggest competitors including 
japan south korea taiwan and west germany did not tax capital 
gains at all so were fighting hard with your continued 
support for that crucial tax cut he said 
capital gains are the income from the sale of stocks real 
estate and other assets it is currently taxed at the same rate as 
other income up to 33 percent bushs proposal would lower the 
rate in effect to about 195 percent 
we intend to work with you closely constantly and 
consistently to see that american electronics and technologies 
regain and retain a preeminent position in world markets bush 
told the trade organization that represents us chip manufacturers 
he praised the industry for becoming the nations largest 
manufacturing employer creating jobs for over 25 million 
americans 
the president also said he was optimistic that his meeting last 
weekend in california with japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu 
would help pry open more markets in japan 
he said he and kaifu specifically discussed satellites and 
telecommunications super computers forest products 
andsemiconductors i hope on the basis of our talks that japan 
will be moving toward early resolution of these problem areas 
there has been a longstandng trade dispute between the united 
states and japan over semiconductors or computer chips that 
resulted in temporary sanctions against japan in 1987 for 
dumping chips in us markets deliberately selling chips at 
belowmarket prices

when the time comes for doling out financial 
encouragement and moral support dinks often must wait at the end 
of the line 
the millions of modern american households nicknamed for their 
doubleincome nokids status are widely presumed to be doing just 
fine on their own with economic advantages few others enjoy 
social commentators have gone so far as to portray dinks as 
egomaniacs hooked on instant gratification if a layoff or other 
reversal hits either half of a dink partnership sympathy may be 
slow in coming even from close friends and relatives 
the accuracy of such generalizations of course varies widely 
from one twoincome zerodependent living unit to the next 
even in households where the cash flow never seems to stop say 
experts in matters of personal finance dinks face problems of 
money management and planning that are just about unique to their 
species 
while two incomes can give couples a financial edge that edge 
is often blunted by poor planning says candace e trunzo in her 
book financial planning for the twocareer family recently 
published under the auspices of john hancock financial services 
not only financial stability but family stability can suffer 
if there is no management or compromise in a twocareer family 
the steady flow of multiple paychecks in a dink household can 
overcome any impulse to develop disciplined habits or plan for the 
future making such regimens harder and harder to adopt and adjust 
to with the passage of time 
if a twocareer family has something of a cushion against a 
disruption in the life of either worker it also may be doubly 
exposed to the risk of changing economic circumstances 
with such considerations in mind many advisers urge dinks to 
save a greater percentage of their income than others might deem 
prudent as much as 25 percent or even more 
sock it away before you spend it on restaurants clothes and 
cars says john erb at the accounting firm of deloitte amp touche 
societys presumption that dinks are more capable than most of 
bearing the cost of government shows up clearly in the tax code 
because they lack most of the deductions that reduce taxable 
income they stand virtually defenseless before the tax man erb 
observes 
to reduce the tax bite erb recommends that dinks make the 
maximum contributions possible to such things as individual 
retirement accounts and employersponsored retirement savings 
programs 
he also suggests that when they save they give extra emphasis 
to growth investments such as stocks and mutual funds seeking out 
longterm capital gains over current income from their nest eggs 
tax rates are now the same for both capital gains and dividend 
and interest income but tax bills on capital gains dont arise 
until you decide to sell an investment 
for unmarried dinks planning is complicated by questions of 
what rights lawmakers the courts and society are willing to accord 
them for example on the death of either partner in the household 
married couples are urged to consider special strategies as 
well for instance they may be prime candidates to save on tax 
deductions for medical or miscellaneous expenses by filing their 
returns separately rather than jointly 
advisers also suggest that twocareer families give their 
employee benefit programs close scrutiny to eliminate overlaps 
when it comes to things like insurance trunzo writes the goal 
is to be adequately but not overly insured particularly if you 
are paying for benefits from your own pockets

groups of senators worked behind the scenes 
today to toughen a compromise clean air bill trying to craft 
amendments that would place additional pollution controls on 
automobiles and industry 
floor debate on the clean air bill moved ahead slowly with 
several controversial amendments including the tighter controls 
on automobile emissions yet to come up for consideration 
both senate leaders and the bush administration were trying to 
keep intact a compromise bill fashioned during three weeks of 
closeddoor bargaining opposing amendments that would either 
weaken or strenthen the legislation 
in the house the energy and commerce committees energy and 
power subcommittee which had planned later today to consider a 
proposal to help midwest utilities pay for costly sulfur dioxide 
emission controls put off its hearing until thursday 
rep philip sharp dind chairman of the house energy and 
power subcommittee of the energy and commerce committee has argued 
for a special fee to help the midwest utilities congressional 
sources said it was unclear whether sharp had enough votes even in 
his subcommittee to tack onsuch a provision 
a costsharing fee has been opposed by the bush administration 
as well as many lawmakers from areas where utilities already have 
relatively cleanburning electric power plants the senate bill 
contains no such provision although some allowances to help the 
midwest are included 
in the senate a number of noncontroversial amendments were 
approved by a voice vote tuesday and today 
the house and senate clean air measures call for tougher 
controls on smogcausing pollution from automobiles and industrial 
sources curbs on toxic chemical releases by industry and for the 
first time cuts in acid rain pollutants from coalfired utility 
plants 
the house bill remains in committee last week a senate 
compromise with the bush administration sent that bodys measure to 
the floor for debate 
for most of tuesday the senate debated an amendment brought by 
sen steve symms ridaho to change the toxic chemical section of 
the bill but by late afternoon the proposal was withdrawn and the 
senate later approved by voice vote a number of noncontroversial 
amendments 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine complained that 
senators were slow in producing amendments and vowed to keep the 
legislation on the floor until we see some progress even if it 
means working into the weekend 
we cant permit legislation of this magnitude not to proceed 
because no senator wants to come forward with an amendment 
mitchell declared in an almost empty senate chamber late tuesday 
despite the lack of floor action there was considerable 
activity behind the scenes various groups of senators worked on 
proposed amendments including one to strengthen auto pollution 
controls by reinstating automatic enactment of a second round of 
tailpipe controls 
another would reinstate a requirement that automakers improve 
the fuel economy of their car fleets and control carbon dioxide 
emissions 
both provisions were taken out of the bill during private 
negotiations with the bush administration which considered them 
too expensive to the auto industry

greyhound says it is slowly but surely 
restoring service at the strikebound bus company with replacement 
drivers and breakaway union members 
greyhound lines inc americas only nationwide bus system said 
today its ridership tuesday was 371 percent of the number carreid 
on the same day last year an increase from mondays 338 percent 
and fridays 30 percent 
the trend is up there is no erosion in our service said 
george gravley a spokesman for gli holdings parent company of 
greyhound its getting better slowly but surely 
the companys 6300 drivers and about 3000 office and 
maintenance workers are on strike the union has asked for new 
talks but none are scheduled although the chief negotiators spoke 
briefly by telephone tuesday 
the union issued a bulletin to its members tuesday urging them 
to use their cars to take blood to hospitals where supplies may 
have been disrupted by the strike 
but red cross officials said they were unaware of any serious 
disruptions although blood usually delivered by bus was being 
carried by alternate transportation in some cases 
the company has been operating with about 700 replacement 
drivers plus what it says are 350 union members who crossed picket 
lines union officials said their own checks show that only 95 
union drivers have been behind the wheel 
gravley said the replacement drivers are being paid under the 
contract terms the strikers rejected 
the contract does not change base pay but allows drivers to 
reach higher pay levels sooner by setting up a system based on 
experience rather than seniority gravley said it also rewards 
accidentfree driving he said 
the union has rejected pay increases linked to productivity 
greyhound drivers made an average of 24743 last year according 
to the company

nineteen salaried pratt amp whitney workers 
who were dismissed from jobs in connecticut have filed an 
agediscrimination lawsuit in federal court against the jetengine 
manufacturer 
two of the laidoff employees from pratts plant in north haven 
also filed a separate suit alleging racial discrimination played a 
role in their layoffs 
both lawsuits were filed tuesday in us district court in 
hartford they seek to reinstate most of the employees all over 
age 40 with back pay plus punitive damages 
if the court were to find a willful discrimination and award 
double back pay to the employees pratt could face potential 
payments of 3 million to 5 million 
the lawsuits filed tuesday are similar to ones filed last year 
by pratt workers laid off at the companys engine plant in florida 
those lawsuits by 56 whitecollar workers are pending in federal 
court in west palm beach 
pratts layoffs followed what is called an activity value 
analysis or ava in which it examined all administrative 
functions to eliminate those that overlapped 
curt linke pratt vice president of communications declined to 
discuss the specifics of the lawsuits which he had not read but 
he defended the layoffs 
overall we conducted the ava process as fairly and thoroughly 
as possible linke said and we believe we conducted the whole 
process without discrimination 
pratt the east hartfordbased division of united technologies 
corp has eliminated 2650 salaried jobs in the past two years 
layoffs accounted for two thirds of the cuts the remainder came 
through resignations and retirements 
igor i sikorsky jr a rocky hill attorney representing the 
former employees said pratts layoffs abandoned a longstanding 
policy that used seniority as a key factor in determining who gets 
laid off 
he had said last march that layoff discrimination lawsuits were 
imminent but the suits were delayed as sikorsky first sought and 
last fall entered into outofcourt negotiations with pratts 
lawyers 
the talks aimed at reinstating employees wishing to return 
collapsed last month sikorsky said

pw4000 pratt amp whitney engines the jetengine manufacturer and the 
airline announced wednesday 
the orders come on the heels of a recordbreaking 12 billion 
year for pratt in 1989 and represent the largest single order for 
the pw4000 on record said pratt spokesman david long 
long said the engines would be used to power both boeing 
747400s and mcdonnell douglas md11 widebody aircraft 
pratt received firm orders for 99 engines including spares 
worth about 900 million if the airline follows through with its 
options pratt would supply an additional 135 engines including 
spares worth nearly 13 billion 
deliveries will begin in 1994 and carry through the end of the 
decade long said 
to put the magnitude of the order in perspective all airline 
orders for pratts popular pw4000 engine in 1989 combined totalled 
700 engines worth about 47 billion long said 
selwyn berson president of pratts commercial engine business 
said he was pleased that singapore which has an exclusively 
prattpowered fleet of aircraft intends to continue its 
relationship with the jetengine maker 
in a prepared statement on the orders singapore airlines said 
the decision to remain with pratt engines came after four months 
of exhaustive evaluation 
the company said it also had considered engines produced by 
pratts major rivals general electrics cf680c2 and 
rollsroyces trent 650 but concluded that while all three 
companies offered highquality hightechnology products pratts 
engines were preferable 
taking into account all factors including financial and 
technical sia decided that pratt amp whitney engines had the 
edge over the other engines the airlines statement said 
airline officials also said the new aircraft will permit the 
company to compete better and take advantage of growth 
opportunities provided by the changing global environment 
in addition to providing modern power the airline said the new 
prattpowered fleet will be more fuel efficient and help reduce 
pollution as well as costs

thursdays opening of the geneva motor show one 
of the worlds biggest comes against a backdrop of increasing us 
and japanese efforts to set up plants inside the integrating 
european community 
worldwide auto sales grew again in 1989 reaching record levels 
for the fifth straight year but industry watchers expect 
competition in major markets to increase further and growth to slow 
slightly this year 
many of the new models to be featured at the geneva shows 60th 
annual edition reflect how the industry is relying on powerful 
sporty cars with designer bodies to meet that competition 
ninetynine automakers are displaying latest models at the 
10day show which is aimed mostly at the tastes of nonamerican 
car buyers switzerland is considered a highly competitive market 
because it is highly motorized but has no domestic auto industry 
hyundai which launched into the us market in the 1980s is a 
new entry at geneva this year the south korean maker is showing 
its economy pony model and the topoftheline sonata sedan which 
listed at up to 19660 in switzerland 
with manufacturers increasingly fighting for the medium to 
highpriced sports car bracket each of japans big three makers is 
offering a new model 
nissans 300 zx listed at 50000 features a 280horsepower v6 
engine and fourwheel steering new sporty offerings from mazda and 
toyota sell for about 20000 
italian makers alfa romeo fiat and lancia plus frances 
peugeot are showing substantially revamped sedans 
world passenger car production rose 38 percent last year to 
355 million units with japan gaining market share mainly at the 
expense of us automakers industry figures show 
but noneuropean manufacturers particularly the japanese are 
increasingly signaling fears about losing out in the giant european 
market the eec is due to complete by the end of 1992 
officials of honda and nissan called on the eec wednesday to 
abolish restrictions on japanese car imports as soon as possible 
after 1992 
in interviews in geneva osamu iida of honda motor europe ltd 
and yoshikazu kawana of nissan europe nv rejected a charge made 
this week by the french minister for european affairs edith 
cresson that japanese automakers want to destroy their us and 
european competitors 
kawana said europes consumers and its auto industry will suffer 
if france succeeds in efforts to extend eec curbs on japanese 
imports for 10 or 12 years after 1992

the alfayed brothers who waged a bitter 1 
billion battle for harrods in 1985 exaggerated their wealth and 
background to win the famous department store a government report 
said wednesday 
mohamed ali and salah alfayed were thought to have come from a 
wealthy and established egyptian trading family that exported 
cotton to lancashire in the 19th century and built up a shipping 
empire when really they were the sons of a teacher from a poor 
quarter of alexandria egypt the report said 
the alfayeds denied wednesday that they misled anyone in 
connection with the battle for harrods owner house of fraser plc 
lonrho plc which lost the fight for harrods and has continued 
to battle the alfayeds for the past five years launched a fresh 
multipronged assault wednesday 
lonrho chairman edward du cann said the government parliament 
and the british financial community must act quickly on the report 
or the credibility of all three would be undermined 
the government released its previously withheld report after the 
serious fraud office and the director of the public prosecutions 
said last week they would not pursue a criminal prosecution 
stemming from the takeover 
the government has repeatedly declined to refer the bid to the 
monopolies and mergers commission and did so again on wednesday 
trade secretary nicholas ridley said in the house of commons he 
had referred the trade departments report to authorities to 
determine whether there should be any prosecution for giving false 
evidence to investigators 
however he said he would not seek to have any house of fraser 
directors disqualified 
documents produced by the alfayeds as evidence for the trade 
departments investigation including their birth certificates 
were false and they knew they were false the government report 
said 
the report said it was likely the brothers used their 
association with the sultan of brunei raise funds toward the 1985 
purchase of the department store chain 
the alfayeds did not have enough money of their own to buy 
house of fraser trade department inspectors hugh aldous and sir 
henry brooke said 
the alfayeds said in a statement they bought house of fraser 
chain with cash of their own the trade departments investigation 
was unfair and the accusations worthless they said 
roland tiny rowland lonrhos chief executive has waged a 
long expensive and very public campaign to have the takeover 
reversed repeatedly alleging that the alfayeds misrepresented 
themselves to win harrods the alfayeds repeatedly have denied 
those allegations 
over the years rowland has developed a reputation for 
obsessively pursuing a bitter unsuccessful vendetta 
lonrho is pursuing its own claims in civil court du cann said 
wednesday 
mohamed alfayed who serves as house of fraser chairman and is 
visibly proud of owning the crown jewel of british retailing has 
vowed that only god would take harrods away from him 
founded in 1849 by tea merchant henry charles harrod harrods 
boasts that it provides everything from baby clothes to funerals 
from furnished palaces to fresh pheasants 
its fivestory redbrick building in fashionable knightsbridge 
is a major tourist attraction and a shopping haunt of britains 
royal family

the house today upheld president bushs veto 
of a bill to let the government intervene in the yearold eastern 
airlines dispute 
the 261160 vote was 7 votes short of the twothirds needed to 
overturn the veto 
bush vetoed in december a measure creating a special panel to 
investigate and recommend solutions to the bitter dispute between 
eastern and 8500 mechanics and other ground service workers he 
said congress had no business intervening in a labormanagement 
dispute 
override supporters said it was the last chance to save the 
bankrupt carrier and jobs for the machinists who walked out last 
march 
but members who sided with bush said a congressional panel would 
not be able to solve the dispute and the matter belonged in 
bankruptcy court 
during debate on the override attempt rep bud schuster rpa 
accused democrats of having an uncontrollable urge to bash the 
president on the issue 
but rep james mcdermott dwash said our government is 
turning its back on the working men and women of this country the 
president said there is no emergency but he doesnt have to fly on 
an airline thats on the verge of collapse 
the vote dealt a huge blow to organized labor and gave bush a 
victory in his second veto confrontation of the electionyear 
session bush also won the first showdown in january when the 
senate narrowly upheld his veto of a measure protecting chinese 
students 
union officials contend bush has sided with frank lorenzo head 
of texas air corp easterns parent company in the dispute and 
therefore is supporting what they consider unionbusting practices 
by lorenzo 
some republicans are going to support the president on this 
but i think theyre going to do it holding their nose and walking 
the plank for a person they dont particularly feel good about 
oberstar said referring to lorenzo 
eastern sought bankruptcy protection in march 1989 shortly after 
the international association of machinists walked out the 
machinists were later joined by pilots and flight attendants who 
ended their strike late last year the machinists are still out 
eastern has hired replacements for some of the strikers and has 
tried to reorganize itself as a smaller carrier 
white house spokesman stephen hart said the administration still 
thinks the eastern strike is something that we should not be 
involved in 
in a letter to house members tuesday machinists president 
george kourpias said an override would send a loud clear signal 
that it is time to stop laborbashing 
on monday bankruptcy examiner david shapiro sent a leader to 
house republican leader robert michel of illinois urging congress 
to stay out of the dispute saying its intervention might 
jeopardize the remaining 17000 jobs at eastern

the nations big three automakers are reviewing 
their estimates for 1990 sales amid signs that sales early this 
year have been stronger than they had expected 
i think that as the year begins to unfold that the more 
optimistic forecast of more like 145 million cars and trucks is 
more likely chrysler corp vice chairman gerald greenwald said 
in an interview tuesday 
late last year chrysler was the most pessimistic of the big 
three companies forecasting car and truck sales industrywide of 
142 million for 1990 down from 1485 million in 1989 
backing up three months as the fourth quarter of last year 
unfolded there was a lot of concern that this year could really be 
tough greenwald said 
since then chrysler and general motors corp have delayed 
factory shutdowns and layoffs january and february sales were 
running less than 1 percent behind last years rate and the spring 
buying season is getting under way 
on monday when february sales figures were reported robert 
rewey ford motor cos north american sales vice president 
indicated that the no 2 automaker may revise its estimate 
looking at the first two months of the new year sales are not 
only much improved from the fourth quarter but somewhat ahead of 
the pace we anticipated when establishing our industry forecast of 
145 million units in 1990 he said 
gm chairman roger smith predicted as recently as last week that 
sales for the year will come in between 145 million and 15 million 
with a bias toward the upper end of the range 
however auto analyst joseph phillippi of shearson lehman hutton 
of new york city who is holding to his sales prediction of about 
143 million cars and trucks said even though the sales rate may 
be higher than originally projected the increase is coming at a 
price 
when you have a thousand dollars a unit in incentives in the 
marketplace for all the manufacturers on average you should be 
able to sell anything even ice to eskimos phillippi said 
were pumping units out the door but its essentially profitless 
prosperity 
each of the big three companies reported sharply lower profits 
for the fourthquarter and all of 1989 partly because of incentive 
costs and there are predictions that the earnings downturn will 
continue 
yet there are indications that automakers arent as worried 
about the next few months as they were during the last months of 
last year 
gm has put off for a few months the closing of its lakewood car 
assembly plant in atlanta late last year that shutdown which 
will result in about 2200 workers being laid off was scheduled 
for midmarch now gm says it wont happen until april or may 
chrysler also indefinitely suspended some planned reductions in 
assembly line speeds which also would have resulted in indefinite 
layoffs ford plans no changes in production that will result in 
layoffs 
the reductions are aimed at bringing production levels more into 
line with sales levels but as rewey said sales for the first two 
months of the year seem to be running a bit above anticipated 
levels 
in january and february this year automakers sold 219 million 
cars and trucks down just 08 percent from last year when 
companies were offering attractive incentives 
typically march and april are strong car and truck sales months 
as americans get ready for spring and summertime road trips last 
year the sales pace during those two months lagged mainly because 
of the attraction of incentives offered earlier in the year 
this year things could be different 
automakers and dealers are ready to let their inventories of 
unsold cars creep up in anticipation of an increased buying pace 
chrysler recently extended an incentive program through march 
for all of its vehicles except minivans and ford and gm cashback 
and lowinterest financing offers run into april or may 
what would we do if we didnt have that phillippi wondered 
about incentiveenhanced sales its pretty clear that we are 
going to have that all the way through the 1990 model year 
i cant see incentives coming down appreciably unless theres 
a heck of a lot more strength in the economy

labor demand is not softening which may spell problems later this 
year he said

newspapers across the country

said 
west texas intermediate also has been considered overpriced 
relative to comparable grades of crude traded on foreign markets 
recent selling has pushed the april wti contract below 21 a 
barrel breaking through what had been a technical support level 
heating oil prices have begun their normal seasonal weakness due 
to lower demand during warm weather months steel said

a federal jury decided wednesday that american 
tobacco co should not be held liable for the death of a lung 
cancer patient rejecting claims that the company failed to warn 
the public about the dangers of cigarette smoking 
the sixmember jury deliberated about two hours before returning 
its verdict culminating a three week trial lawyers representing 
the plaintiff the cancer victims widow said they would consider 
an appeal 
this just puts a further chill on anyone having the audacity 
to take on one of the empires of industry said eric nissen one 
of the plaintiffs attorneys 
andrew lane an attorney for american tobacco declined to 
comment on the verdict earlier in the day during his closing 
arguments lane stressed that the lung cancer victim george 
kotler had ample opportunity to quit smoking but chose to continue 
his habit 
the suit against american tobacco a subsidiary of american 
brands inc in greenwich conn marked one of the rare smoker 
death cases to reach the courtroom 
the first case to have a damages judgment came in 1988 when a 
federal jury in new jersey awarded 400000 to antonio cipollone 
whose wife died of lung cancer but an appeals court this year 
overturned the jury award and ordered a new trial 
the boston suit was filed by joanne kotler whose husband began 
smoking when he was 11 and died in 1986 at age 55 
the case focused on his smoking habits and american tobaccos 
actions prior to 1966 when congress required warning labels on 
cigarette packs 
lane told the jury that the first credible evidence linking lung 
cancer to smoking surfaced in the 1950s but the studies were not 
definitive and some medical experts disagreed with the findings 
lane also argued that warnings would not have made a difference 
for kotler 
he said that during the 1950s the debate over cigarette smoking 
became more widely reported culminating with a highly publicized 
report from the us surgeon general in 1964 warning of the health 
risks 
but lane said kotler who regularly read newspapers and likely 
was aware of the controversy did not heed the warnings the first 
time kotler quit smoking was in 1975 when advised to do so by his 
doctor and he resumed several months later when his health 
improved 
forty million people have stopped smoking lane said they 
made the decision thats what this case is really about choice 
but garry inge another attorney who helped present the case 
against the cigarette company argued that american tobacco had a 
duty to alert the public of the risks so kotler could make an 
informed choice studies in the 1940s warned about the dangers of 
smoking but american tobaccos response was to encourage people to 
buy its products he said 
burying your head in the sand is not a defense he said 
when youre talking about people dying you cannot wait for 
scientific proof 
inge also said the addictive nature of nicotine contributed to 
kotlers smoking habit 
but lane said when kotler first tried to quit smoking he showed 
no symptoms of withdrawal this was not a man compelled by the 
outside he said

japans nec corp and american telephone amp 
telegraph co said wednesday they would cooperate in developing and 
making a wide range of semiconductors and other computer 
technologies 
the agreement should enhance the us companys access to 
japans worlddominating electronics market 
nec the worlds largest maker of semiconductors agreed to 
cooperate with atampts microelectronics division on various projects 
for at least five years 
under the agreement atampt microelectronics will receive a 
license to market design and produce necs advanced gatearray 
computer chips which are used widely in computers and other 
electronics devices 
atampt did not have the technology to produce these chips on its 
own spokeswoman barbara baklarz said from atampt microelectronics 
headquarters in berkeley heights nj 
an important feature of this agreement is that customers of 
both companies will enjoy the advantage of having two stable 
sources of identical gatearray products william warwick 
president of atampt microelectronics told reporters in tokyo 
in return nec will receive atampts most sophisticated 
computeraided tools used to design computer chips warwick said 
he said the two companies also are working on accelerating the 
placement of atampt semiconductor products into a variety of nec 
products such as communications systems and computers 
in addition atampt microelectronics will help manufacture certain 
nec chips widely used in consumer electronics products 
this will allow japanese customers to obtain products made by 
an american firm and will give atampt a greater presence in the 
japanese market especially with consumer electronics companies 
warwick said 
this agreement shows that one single company cannot stand 
alone and needs more resources to survive said tomohir 
matsumura an nec executive vice president and director of its 
semiconductor division 
it makes sense for atampt as a big semiconductor user to go to 
nec a big semiconductor producer said charles elliott an 
electronics analyst with the investment firm goldman sachs amp co 
but atampt is also a big semiconductor developer and it makes 
sense for atampt to design and nec to produce 
millard phelps an analyst with the san francisco brokerage 
hambrecht amp quist inc said the agreement is part of a global 
cooperation trend among electronics companies 
atampt microelectronics announced two weeks ago that it will 
produce semiconductor memory chips for the international market in 
a joint venture with mitsubishi electric corp another major 
japanese chip manufacturer 
international business machines corp said in january that it 
would set up a joint venture with siemens ag of west germany to 
develop advanced memory chips 
neither atampt nor nec would attach monetary figures to the 
accord but warwick said he was confident it would be continued 
after five years 
gatearray chips are the logic chips that customize computers 
according to their use they are a key component of a computer 
along with its microprocessor or brain and its memory 
atampt lacked the technology to produce complementary metal oxide 
semiconductor or cmos gatearray chips ms baklarz said these 
are considered the most advanced gatearray chips 
the agreement also will aid necs policy of increasing purchases 
of foreign semiconductors to ease trade friction 
us officials angered by what they claim is a closed japanese 
market to foreign semiconductors say japan agreed to boost the 
foreign share of the semiconductor market here to 20 percent by 
july 1991 
but foreign chips share stood at only 129 percent in the final 
quarter of 1989 according to the ministry of international trade 
and industry 
nec expects to purchase 53 million worth of atampt 
semiconductors in 1990 and more in 1991 though there is no target 
figure for next year nec spokeswoman akiko sato said 
the manufacturer plans to raise its internal use of foreign 
computer chips from the current 20 percent to 23 percent by july 
1991 when the usjapan semiconductor accord expires and to 
about 24 percent by the end of next year miss sato said

product pricing errors at a large discount 
store chain that used electronic price scanners has prompted the 
state to probe other stores for similar problems attorney general 
donand hanaway said wednesday 
state investigators announced wednesday that a november 
investigation of shopko stores inc outlets in wisconsin found 
scanned prices at the checkout counter sometimes failed to match 
the advertised sale price on store shelves 
shopko a green baybased retailer with more than 90 outlets in 
wisconsin and the midwest cooperated with the probe and has agreed 
to offer rebates of 1 to 5 to customers who discover future 
overcharges hanaway said 
gene bankers vice president of shopko said the company had 
taken steps to prevent future overcharges 
hanaway said the investigation found 33 electronic pricing 
errors out of 270 items checked at 12 shopko outlets twentyone of 
the errors involved overcharges ranging from 2 cents to 999 
while undercharges ranged from 2 cents to 5 he said 
hanaway said most of the pricing errors resulted because the 
electronic price scanners were immediately reprogrammed after a 
sale but the sale signs not removed from shelves 
the attorney general said the overcharges were human errors 
and not an attempt to defraud customers but the 12 percent error 
rate still was unacceptable 
its my suspicion that its not just shopko hanaway said 
its much bigger than that 
i am broadening the investigation to other general 
merchandising stores and food stores in the state to determine if 
pricing errors are occurring elsewhere he said 
john gary spokesman for the national retail federation in new 
york city said he did not know of any nationwide problem with 
electronic scanning of sale items 
this is the first time ive ever heard of this kind of 
thing gary said 
bankers said to avoid future problems shopko planned to put the 
expiration date of sales on all instore advertisement signs 
hanaway said he believed the shopko probe was the first in 
wisconsin and we believe the nation he said we know of no 
one else who has undertaken such an extensive investigation 
steve nicks director of the state consumer protection agency 
said similar checks may have been conducted on the local level at 
individual stores

farmer mac is a new kid on the financial block 
but is almost ready to start building muscle in the nations 
agricultural credit market officials said wednesday 
the federal agricultural mortgage corp farmer mac was 
created a little more than two years ago by the agricultural credit 
act of 1987 as a secondary market for agricultural real estate 
loans 
startup procedures which included the initial sale of 20 
million in voting common stock to banks and other lenders and the 
naming of a 15member board of directors are expected before 
farmer mac is ready to become active in the financial market later 
this year 
john r dahl chairman of the board said after the 
corporations second annual stockholders meeting that underwriting 
standards and other guides must be developed meticulously to ensure 
integrity 
dahl said farmer mac has a very strong foundation and that 
all the deadlines specified by congress have been met 
the aim of farmer mac he said is to to increase the 
availability of capital to allow agricultural borrowers and rural 
housing borrowers an opportunity of more places to go to look for 
credit 
hopefully dahl added these borrowers also will have the 
benefits of competition and competitive interest rates 
but dahl and henry d edelman the corporations president and 
chief executive officer said they could not estimate a firm 
timetable or identify those in line for actual pooling 
operations 
banks and other lenders can convert longterm assets in this 
case real estate mortgages by selling the loans on the secondary 
market at that point those who buy the mortgages package or pool 
the loans and then sell loanbacked securities to the general 
public 
meanwhile the original lenders are able to increase their cash 
and use it to make more loans to agricultural borrowers 
farmer mac will share the risk of the farm real estate loan 
business by guaranteeing returns on the securities 
other federal agencies such as the federal home loan mortgage 
corp freddie mac federal national mortgage association fannie 
mae and government national mortgage association ginnie mae 
serve a similar function for their clientele 
dahl a rancher from gackle nd said in an interview after 
the meeting that weve come a long way in getting farmer mac on 
solid ground but he said there is no way to estimate the 
corporations eventual impact on the nations agricultural credit 
market 
theres no history involved here he said theres a lot 
of enthusiasm for farmer mac and i wish i could tell you that 
were going to do a billion dollars in business or something but 
theres no way we can predict this 
but what can be predicted dahl added is that were going to 
to everything we possibly can to come up with the kind of program 
that congress envisioned agriculture needed

former bolar pharmaceutical co president 
robert shulman has settled securities fraud charges but 
negotiations are still underway with the generic drug maker itself 
federal regulators said wednesday

merri jo gillettemeadows an attorney with the secs philadelphia 
regional office which brought the case against bolar 
ms gillettemeadows confirmed that negotiations with the 
company were underway but would say no more 
last month the sec charged the drug maker with making 
misleading and inadequate statements to the investing public about 
an agreement with the food and drug administration to suspend 
shipment of its products 
copaigue nybased bolar came under fire after allegations by 
a congressional panel that it appeared to have falsified lab test 
results on its generic high blood pressure medication

operations while the fda conducts an audit 
the sec said shulman who resigned from the companys board last 
month settled with the sec on friday

after two years on the auction block mgmua 
communications said wednesday it had accepted a 12 billion buyout 
offer by italian financier giancarlo parrettis pathe 
communications corp 
parretti also will take over 400 million in junk bond debt as 
part of the deal which may be the final scene of a longrunning 
drama in which a virtual cast of thousands considered buying all or 
part of mgmua 
the proposed marriage would join companies holding extremely 
diverse film properties pathes cannon releasing is a leading 
purveyor of exploitation films with upcoming releases like 
american ninja 4 and lambada the movie while mgm is is 
one of hollywoods jewels responsible for everything from the 
wizard of oz to rain man 
a 15 billion buyout of mgm was aborted last year when the 
suitor australias qintex group missed a 50 million down payment 
mgmua chairman jeffrey c barbakow said mgm already had 
commitments from pathe worth 100 million to distribute pathe 
movies the deal also requires parretti to come up with 200 
million earnest money with the first 50 million deposit due 
friday 
if for whatever reason this doesnt close then we have the 
money for damages said barbakow 
he said he was confident parretti could arrange financing for 
the deal but declined to say where parretti was traveling 
wednesday and could not be reached for comment in the past he has 
financed deals with help from credit lyonnais group the 
international financial giant 
the deal is the latest step in the globalization of hollywood 
sony corp acquired columbia pictures last year australias news 
corp owns fox and the cbs rca and aampm record labels are owned by 
japanese german and dutch companies englands television south 
plc owns televisions mtm productions 
mgmua has profitable tv and home video divisions and a film 
distribution system in place it has been trying to start producing 
films again recently after a twoyear fallow period while its 
controlling shareholder beverly hills billionaire kirk kerkorian 
sought a buyer 
mgmua communications has lost money in four of the last five 
years the studios only major release of 1990 stanley amp iris 
with jane fonda and robert de niro was a critical and commercial 
disaster 
pathe which grew out of parrettis purchase of cannon group in 
1987 produces and distributes movies worldwide and controls more 
than 1000 theater screens in five countries it has film 
production facilities in italy a processing lab in france and the 
rights to 500 movies and 2000 newsreels 
mgmuas unique library and strong distribution capabilities 
complement pathes existing business worldwide parretti pathes 
president and chief executive said in a statement we are 
confident the transaction will result in a strong dual company 
structure which will be strongly competitive 
pathe is making a tender offer of 20 per share for mgmuas 
common stock worth about 1 billion if all the shares are 
tendered kerkorian will tender all his common shares 82 percent 
of the total and also will sell his preferred stock to pathe for 
about 200 million the transaction was expected to close by june 
23 
mgmuas stock jumped 375 to 1775 a share on the new york 
stock exchange 
the companies said they would operate separately for the time 
being but the actual management structure remained unclear 
barbakow said he and other officials intended to stay on at mgm 
many of them have worked with key pathe officials in the past at 
mgmua and other studios for example pathes film chief alan 
ladd jr once held that position at mgmua before he quit in 1988 
over the companys lack of direction 
as far as putting the management team together that will have 
to be resolved in the next three to four weeks said richard 
berger mgmuas head of film production 
berger said mgmua already had committed 185 million to 
restarting movie production and said he assumed more would be 
forthcoming from the new buyers 
analysts have estimated it would take 500 million for 600 
million over two years for mgmua to reestablish itself as a major 
movie producer 
on monday the companies announced mgmua had reached a 
fiveyear deal to distribute films from pathe a coup for mgm 
which is dependent on movies from independent producers until it 
gets its own product back in the distribution pipeline 
parretti whose 89 million beverly hills mansion is filled 
with masterpiece paintings owns a large european travel agency and 
acquired the cannon group in summer 1987 
he used cannon as a platform to make unsuccessful bids on 
several smaller entertainment companies including de laurentiis 
group new world entertainment and kings road entertainment 
besides qintex other potential buyers for mgm at various times 
included rupert murdochs news corp which was outbid by qintex 
last year cable television magnate ted turner sony producers jon 
peters and peter guber warner communications financier marvin 
davis weintraub entertainment group polygram the walt disney 
co c itoh and co and a variety of other industry players

the justice department has no objections to 
eastern airlines proposed sale of its prized latin american routes 
to rival american airlines the department said wednesday 
the proposed 471 million transaction still must be approved by 
the transportation department and the federal bankruptcy court in 
new york overseeing the reorganization of miamibased eastern 
joe krovisky a spokesman for the justice departments antitrust 
division said the division informed the two airlines and the 
transportation department that its review of potential antitrust 
problems of the sale had yielded no reason to object 
earlier this week pan am corp filed objections to the route 
sale with the transportation department arguing that it would 
eventually make american the dominant airline in miami pan am 
asked for a hearing on the issue 
eastern and american have until march 13 to file responses to 
pan ams objections transportation department spokesman hal paris 
said a decision on the sale probably would be made in three or four 
weeks 
under the agreement american the nations largest airline 
would take over easterns routes from miami to ecuador peru 
colombia bolivia panama guatemala costa rica and paraguay 
pan am told the transportation department that it rather than 
american should be awarded service from miami to guayaquil and 
quito ecuador lima peru and bogota colombia 
also included in the sale would be easterns miamitoronto 
route which pan am said it should be awarded 
a sale of the routes would reduce eastern to about twothirds 
its prestrike size

the farm credit system reported wednesday that 
its fourthquarter profit fell 33 percent from a year earlier 
the system said it earned 181 million in the three months ended 
dec 31 down from 270 million in the fourth quarter of 1989 
the decline in net income was due largely to a reduction in 
provisions for loan losses reflecting an improvement in credit 
quality said daniel bienz a vice president of the federal farm 
credit banks funding corp the financing arm of the farm credit 
system 
he said net interest income rose while most expenses remained 
stable pershare figures do not apply 
the farm credit system is a nationwide system of federally 
chartered agricultural lending institutions serving the rural 
economy and cooperatively owned by their borrowers 
the system took several steps last year to streamline its 
structure following 1987 legislation that included the issuance of 
up to 4 billion in governmentbacked lowinterest loans 
for all of 1989 the system earned 695 million down from 704 
million the previous year 
for the second consecutive year the system has achieved 
favorable results suggesting continued progress in returning to 
financial soundness and strength said james a brickley 
president and chief executive officer of the federal farm credit 
banks funding corp 
net interest income totaled 275 million for the fourth quarter 
up from 216 million in the yearearlier quarter and 101 billion 
for the full year up from 787 million in 1988 
the system said net interest income increased as a result of 
continued improvement in the credit quality of its loan portfolio 
stemming from a reduction in nonaccrual loans 
when loans are placed on nonaccrual status they are accounted 
for only as they come in rather than when they are due

an argentine convicted of trying to 
extort 10 million from the du pont co in exchange for stolen 
documents detailing the companys production of lycra was sentenced 
wednesday to 6 years in prison 
two codefendants received prison terms in us district court 
in a scheme involving sensitive documents taken from du ponts 
lycra manufacturing plant in mercedes argentina 
lycra is du ponts trade name for spandex an elastic fiber used 
in clothing such as swimsuits and leotards the wilmingtonbased 
chemicals manufacturer controls more than 50 percent of the world 
spandex market with more than 600 million in sales in 1988 
bruno skerianz 52 the alleged mastermind of the extortion 
plot also was placed on three years probation by us district 
judge joseph longobardi codefendants raul armando giordano 37 
and antonio ruben inigo 40 received 3year prison sentences and 
three years probation 
attorneys for the defendants said they plan to appeal 
the three were convicted in december of one count each of 
conspiracy to extort and attempted extortion each count carried a 
maximum penalty of 20 years in prison a fine of up to 250000 and 
a maximum five years probation 
prosecutors said during the trial that du pont had to agree to 
pay for the documents or skerianz would have sold them to a 
competitor 
du pont also made an agreement with the three men that they 
would not work in spandex production for five years and that du 
pont would sell spandex yarn to a company chosen by skerianz during 
the period the government said 
defense lawyers maintained that skerianz had not attempted 
extortion because he and the others had planned to manufacture 
spandex for radicci an italian textile manufacturer 
skerianz had worked for du pont more than 20 years ago the 
others resigned in the fall of 1988 from the mercedes plant 
the three defendants and lorenzo de bianchini were arrested in 
february 1989 in geneva switzerland after an aborted attempt to 
return the documents for 10 million petrosino was arrested at the 
beginning of last summer 
longobardi ordered the three defendants to pay 100 to a 
victims compensation fund he said he did not impose a fine or 
order restitution to du pont because of the defendants bleak 
financial situations 
the men were sentenced to concurrent terms on each count a 
fourth defendant jose petrosino is fighting extradition from 
italy charges against maria i lorenzo de bianchini who testified 
for the prosecution were dropped 
du pont spokesman r john malloy said the company was pleased 
with the sentences which he said would be a strong deterrent for 
those who might consider doing similar things

wednesday as it struggled against a concerted effort by central 
banks to bring the us currency lower 
gold prices fell closing below 400 an ounce in london 
traders reported the federal reserve and other central banks 
entered the currency markets to sell dollars and a published 
report in tokyo said the members of the group of seven industrial 
nations had agreed to intervene jointly to try to stop the dollars 
climb

we havent seen this kind of demand for dollars since the end 
of 1989 and probably going back to the summer of 1989 levine 
said 
despite the efforts of the central banks the increased demand 
for the dollar was likely to lift it even higher he said
