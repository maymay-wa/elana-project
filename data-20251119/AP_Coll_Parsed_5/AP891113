asked whether he would rule out us involvement in the fighting 
he said at this point its not anticipated 
fiftyfive us military trainers are stationed in el salvador 
but are not supposed to participate in military missions fitzwater 
said their status was unchanged 
the rebels began their offensive attacking 35 to 40 military 
posts in the city and others in the provinces after pulling out of 
peace talks to protest attacks on leftist political and union 
leaders they blame the military and the cristiani government for 
the attacks 
cristiani who took office june 1 leads the rightist 
nationalist republican alliance known as arena his party has been

dartmouth college will sell off 115 
million worth of investments in companies doing business in south 
africa by the end of the year the board of trustees announced 
monday 
the ivy league school which has been a hot spot in the debate 
in this country over south africas apartheid policies will also 
refrain from such investments in the future the board said in a 
statement 
dartmouth president james freedman read the announcement at a 
faculty meeting and 250 to 300 students who were present cheered 
the board said the investments have great symbolic meaning 
and that disputes over them undermine dartmouths ability to 
achieve some educational goals 
the trustees recognize that many firms continuing to do 
business in south africa are making positive contributions to the 
lives of their employees and the political process in south 
africa the statement said 
the board said it made the decision to divest saturday after 
discussing the adverse impact of these nominal investments 
dartmouths investments in companies doing business in south 
africa have declined from 63 million or 15 percent of its 
endowment to 115 million or less than 2 percent the board said 
after the announcement heetan kalan a sophomore who heads the 
international student association on campus said im 
speechless its a great victory 
a representative of the african national congress who has worked 
for 15 years to get dartmouth to divest its south african 
investments said he still cant believe the fight is over 
themba ntinga a representative to the united nations for the 
anc was at the school monday to debate peter soal a member of 
south africas parliament both men had been invited to dartmouth 
before the decision to divest 
its totally unexpected said ntinga whose organization is 
outlawed in south africa its a sweet victory for the principles 
of fairness 
this not only will send a message to south africa but also 
to the racist south african parliament itself he said 
divestment had not been on the agenda for the trustees weekend 
meeting freedman said he did not think a weekend protest during 
the trustees meeting had anything to do with the decision 
by law and custom south africas apartheid policy establishes a 
racially segregated society in which the 28 million blacks have no 
vote in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy 
and maintain separate districts schools and health services 
since 1972 dartmouth has adopted investment policies that 
included prohibitions against investments in south african 
companies financial institutions making loans to the south african 
government companies supplying goods and services involved in 
enforcing apartheid and companies doing business in south africa 
that didnt adhere to certain employment practices 
in november 1985 students built shanties on dartmouth green to 
protest apartheid the following january 12 students including 
nine members of the offcampus dartmouth review attacked the 
shanties with sledgehammers saying the school should not be held 
hostage by any group and that the shanties were erected illegally 
dartmouth pressured the students to move the shanties off 
campus the last one was removed that february after the college 
had 18 students who stood in the way arrested dartmouth dropped 
all charges against the 18 
also in 1985 some faculty members urged gradual divestment the 
college began reducing its investments that year faculty members 
again urged divestment last year

an 11yearold boy was shot to death 
when he went to a suspected drug house with his sister to get her 
belongings police said a 14yearold boy was arrested 
police said they found frederick jones lying in the street after 
receiving a report of a shooting about 5 pm saturday the boy was 
taken to a hospital where he died about an hour later from a shot 
to the chest 
there is no motive said sgt pete edlund of the homicide 
unit 
he knocked on the door a guy said who is it then the door 
opened and a shot was fired 
relatives of the boy said he and his 14yearold sister 
latrisha weekly went to the house where they lived until a month 
ago latrisha said their mothers former boyfriend lives at the 
house but was out of town 
latrisha said sunday that the 14yearold suspect let her in and 
she went upstairs to collect her clothes her brother followed her 
to the door 
police refused to say if the shooting was drugrelated but 
members of the ad hoc group against crime and neighbors said the 
house has a history of drug dealings 
edlund said police recovered weapons at the house he would not 
say whether a drug transaction was involved but he said it is not 
unusual to see children in the drug trade 
we see 8 9 and 10yearolds running drugs and selling them 
in the street he said 
the suspect will be referred to juvenile court which will 
decide whether he should stand trial as an adult 
the killing came four days after voters in the kansas city mo 
area approved a quartercent increase in the sales tax to raise 98 
million during the next seven years to fight the war on drugs the 
measure passed 60 percent to 40 percent 
it also comes at a time when police are growing worried that a 
shortage of crack cocaine could spur violence in the city 
six weeks ago when the big glut was on some dope houses were 
selling two rocks for the price of one said sgt dan mulloy of 
the street narcotics unit the supply and demand situation went 
berserk everybody was dealing dope then all of a sudden it was 
like boom the door slammed 
although it is too early to know what is causing the shortage or 
how long it will last it is creating new hazards in the already 
dangerous drug trade 
undercover officers say they are facing increasingly hostile 
dealers strung out from their own drug habits and eager to protect 
their wares one undercover detective was shot nov 2 and police 
worry that more shootings could follow 
just as troubling is an increase in fake or turkey drugs 
made of soap candle wax or pancake mix which dealers are selling 
to addicts police fear the practice could lead to more violence 
when the deals go bad 
authorities also say the shortage is pushing up the price of 
cocaine which could lead to more drugrelated crime as users 
struggle to finance their habit an agent for the drug enforcement 
administration in kansas city said 1 kilogram of cocaine now sells 
for 25000 up from 20000 just a month ago

senators are preparing to decide an issue that 
touches some of americas most sensitive nerve endings should a 
member of a private club that bars women and minorities be 
confirmed as a federal judge 
the question is do organizations like the olympic club hurt 
people and it seems to me absolutely that they do professor 
stephen gillers of new york university school of law told the 
senate judiciary committee last week 
the question for the senate is whether to confirm san francisco 
attorney vaughn walker as a district court judge despite the fact 
that he has for 15 years belonged to that citys embattled olympic 
club long a bastion of white male dominance 
the club barred blacks from its rolls for decades and still 
refuses to admit women as full members 
the larger issue extending beyond california is whether the 
senate should confirm judges who belong to such clubs liberals and 
civil rights organizations say the answer is no 
the senate judiciary committee could take a step toward 
answering those questions thursday if it votes on whether to send 
the walker nomination to the senate floor supporters of walker are 
pushing for a vote 
judiciary committee chairman joseph r biden jr ddel hasnt 
announced whether he will call for a vote any one of walkers 
critics on the panel could block action under committee rules 
the walker nomination is the most pressing in the longrunning 
tugofwar between liberals and conservatives on the senate 
judiciary committee over federal judiciary nominees 
also facing the panel is a potentially more explosive dispute 
over president bushs naming of clarence thomas chairman of the 
equal employment opportunity commission as a judge of the us 
court of appeals in the district of columbia that issue is 
guaranteed to spill over into next year 
the lawmakers also are being asked to approve elevation of 
bushs cousin district judge john walker of new york to the 
appeals bench harvard law professor alan dershowitz alleges the 
nomination violates federal antinepotism law when the issue will 
be resolved is unclear 
thursdays executive session of the judiciary committee is the 
last planned for this year 
thus thursday could be the final trip to the plate in 1989 for 
vaughn walker in his frustrating twoyear quest for judicial 
confirmation 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio an outspoken critic of 
discriminatory clubs and other liberals say such memberships 
create an image of unfairness that has no place on the bench the 
american bar association has adopted rules discouraging 
confirmation of judicial nominees who belong to clubs that bar 
minorities and women 
few if any senators defend discriminatory clubs but sen alan 
simpson rwyo and other conservatives say there are more 
important issues to consider in evaluating judicial nominees 
at first blush vaughn walkers credentials appear solid the 
silverhaired 45yearold attorney has a law degree from stanford 
a partnership in a bluechip company and a well qualified 
rating from his local bar association 
like most district court nominees he has the blessing of a 
homestate senator in this case republican pete wilson but his 
longtime membership in the olympic club has been dogging the 
nomination for almost two years 
the matter is made more complicated because after being besieged 
about the club and its discriminatory policy for eight months 
walker resigned in a letter dated feb 15 
but critics say thats not enough they say he was too slow in 
removing his name from the membership roles and did too little to 
fight the policy of excluding women 
i still wonder whether he resigned because he believed his 
club membership was wrong or because he sought to curry favor with 
the committee metzenbaum told a hearing thursday 
he questioned walker closely on why the resignation letter was 
not marked as received by the club until april 15 and why he paid 
his dues through march walker said he gave the letter to a club 
officer for delivery in february and that was the last he saw of 
it he said he inadvertently paid march dues because they were on 
the same bill with his february club expenses 
republican senators registered increasing impatience after 
listening to the interrogation simpson left for another hearing 
describing the questions as balderdash 
meanwhile the senate will debate monday and vote tuesday on 
rival republican and democratic proposals to provide economic aid 
to poland and hungary 
the democratic version authorizes a threeyear package with a 
value of nearly 1 billion while the republican version calls for 
a little more than half that the idea is to furnish funds to the 
two east european nations to assist them as they embark on 
wideranging reforms 
polish solidarity leader lech walesa will address a joint 
meeting of the house and senate at midweek 
the senate plans two days of action on bushs proposal to reduce 
the capital gains tax republicans who have been trying 
unsuccessfully to push the tax cut through congress all year are 
expected to be defeated and have promised that if they are they 
will not raise the issue again until 1990 
congressional leaders and bush administration officials continue 
their efforts to reach agreement on a package cutting 14 billion 
from this years deficit of 116 billion weeks of closeddoor 
bargaining has left democrats and republicans at odds over how to 
reduce the shortfall 
meanwhile 16 billion in cuts imposed under the grammrudman 
law on most federal programs oct 16 remain in effect

this mediterranean island that held back 
the turks in an epic 16thcentury siege and withstood heavy bombing 
by the germans and italians in world war ii is now bracing for an 
invasion by todays superpowers 
officials making land arrangements for the dec 23 offshore 
summit of president bush and mikhail s gorbachev are expecting an 
army of some 2000 people between delegations and journalists or 
about three times the size of the maltese armed forces 
for an island more accustomed to putting on horseandarmor 
medieval costume parties for british and west german tourists than 
catering to the security and communication needs of such a 
gathering the summit came as a shock 
when i heard the news i thought the moon had fallen from the 
sky said arthur l pace the governments director of 
information 
but malta which had a 2000year history of foreign domination 
until it achieved independence from britain in 1964 sees the 
summit as an opportunity to make its contribuition to world peace 
as well as promote its tourist facilities and ambitions to become 
an offshore banking center 
and the summit is seen as a dry run for the first visit by pope 
john paul ii to the overwhelmingly roman catholic island in may 
with history the stuff of malta and politics considered the 
national pastime summit followers will get a dose of both the 
opposition party is promising a protest against nucleararmed 
warships 
as the site of offices of the us and soviet delegations and 
the international press center organizers have chosen the 
mediterranean conference center a monumental complex built as a 
hospital by the knights of malta in 1574 
it was the knights mobilized to defend christian europe who 
held onto the island during the long siege by the ottoman turks in 
1565 malta came under british rule in 1800 
the complex with its vaulted ceilings and religious reliefs 
suffered heavy bombing damage in world war ii when king george vi 
of britain awarded the population the george cross for bravery and 
winston churchill referred to malta as the unsinkable aircraft 
carrier 
the building was completely restored and repaired again after a 
1987 fire in its main auditorium maltese organizers hope to keep 
the onshore activities within the confines of the center while the 
leaders meet aboard ships 
there has been no official confirmation but maltese expect the 
warships to be anchored in marsaxlokk bay within sight of fishing 
villages on the islands eastern end 
last year at the time of a visit by the british aircraft 
carrier ark royal parliament adopted a resolution saying malta 
expects that visiting ships wont be carrying nuclear weapons 
the conservative government of prime minister edward fenech 
adami hopes the soviets and americans will take heed but the 
leftist opposition plans a demonstration if assurances are lacking 
bush and gorbachev are absolutely welcome they will be 
welcomed by all maltese people said joseph brincat deputy 
leader of the malta labor party adding is it necessary to have a 
nuclear warship in grand harbor 
diplomats say the islands improved ties with washington and 
loosened links with libya its central location in the 
mediterranean and its official policy of neutrality and 
nonalignment apparently played a role in the decision to hold the 
summit off malta 
gorbachev will be arriving from a visit to italy and the vatican 
one of fenech adamis first official acts was to scrap part of a 
1984 friendship treaty with libya calling for exchange of military 
and security information it was under this pact that malta gave 
advance warning to libya of the us air raids on tripoli and 
benghazi in april 1986 
libyan officials are due here in coming days to renegotiate the 
pact and the military clause is expected to be formally dropped 
although trade with libya is flourishing officials stress the 
government is trying to change the direction of maltese foreign 
policy from 16 years of socialist rule says austin gatt secretary 
general of the nationalist party 
we want friendly relations with everyone and look to the 
western world as a natural ally 
organizers also believe the visit of bushs brother william to 
september ceremonies marking the 25th anniversary of maltese 
independence played a key role in the choice of malta

computer crime specialists fear that renegade 
programmers who attack the nations computing networks with viruses 
and other software mischief may be able to escape prosecution under 
existing laws 
joseph b tompkins jr chairman of the american bar 
associations task force on computer crime told a congressional 
panel this past week that there are clearly some types of 
computer virus activity that would be beyond the terms of the 
current statute 
he and other witnesses outlined a series of activities that 
could fall through the cracks of ambiguous federal laws 
for example if a computer hacker sends a program laced with a 
hidden virus to an electronic bulletin board can he be prosecuted 
for harm that results when other bulletin board users transfer the 
virusinfected software into their own systems 
can the hacker be successfully prosecuted if he claims that he 
really didnt have any malicious intent but instead was merely 
trying to pull off an innocent prank or aiming to demonstrate 
existing weaknesses in computer security 
under current federal law the answer to both questions is 
maybe 
these are among key issues being considered by the house 
judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice as it studies 
legislation designed to help fight viruses and other forms of 
malicious software 
the panels chairman rep charles e schumer dny said last 
week that computer viruses cost industry and government at least 
millions of dollars in damage and disruption and yet there is 
no specific federal criminal statute in place to attack this type 
of malicious programming 
schumer said afterward that it seems to me that presently not 
enough is going on to combat viruses i think the likelihood is 
that we will do some kind of legislation he said 
computer viruses generally are small strings of computer code 
that can infect legitimate computer programs and may cause 
destruction or alteration of data files 
the computer fraud and abuse act of 1986 makes it a federal 
crime to intentionally access a federal interest computer without 
authorization and alter destroy or damage information in such 
computer or prevent authorized access to such computer if such 
conduct causes the loss of 1000 or more during any oneyear 
period 
federal interest applies to us government computers 
computers of financial institutions and cases involving computers 
located in more than one state 
but at last weeks hearing tompkins said the statute does not 
in clear terms cover the intentional implantation of a computer 
virus in a computer which one is authorized to access even if the 
perpetrator clearly intended harm or the virus in fact caused 
significant harm 
the question of intent has been raised in the federal court case 
pending against robert tappan morris 24 of arnold md 
morris who at the time was a cornell university graduate 
student has been indicted in connection with the socalled 
worm which in november 1988 paralyzed about 6000 computers 
connected to the internet electronic network 
the case is slated to go to trial nov 29 in syracuse ny if 
convicted morris faces up to five years in prison and a 250000 
fine 
morris attorney sought to have the indictment dismissed on 
several grounds contending that morris did not have the intent to 
cause losses of 1000 or more however the government argued that 
the statute requires only that the defendant intend to access a 
federal interest computer without authorization 
tompkins said the fact that the intent requirement was the 
subject of serious dispute indicates that the provision should be 
reviewed 
he said the law also has been attacked as unconstitutionally 
vague 
while these arguments are probably overstated clarifying the 
statute might prevent such arguments from being raised and might 
encourage prosecutors to make more frequent use of the statute 
he said 
three antivirus bills are pending in the house sponsored by 
reps wally herger rcalif c thomas mcmillen dmd and edward 
j markey dmass chairman of the energy and commerce 
subcommittee on telecommunications and finance 
hergers bill would impose penalties of up to 20 years in prison 
on people convicted of interfering with the operations of 
computers through the use of programs containing hidden commands 
that can cause harm 
the mcmillen measure seeks to punish anyone who willfully and 
knowingly sabotages the proper operation of a computer hardware 
system or the associated software markeys bill would make the 
introduction of a computer virus into an interstate electronic 
network a federal crime 
at last weeks hearing the legislative initiatives were 
strongly criticized by john l pickitt president of the computer 
and business equipment manufacturers association a 
washingtonbased industry group whose member companies last year 
had combined sales of more than 230 billion 
like the swine flu vaccine of the 1970s these antivirus 
bills could end up doing more harm than good he testified 
pickitt contended that outlawing some of the programming 
techniques used to create computer viruses might prevent the use of 
similar programs for beneficial purposes including countering a 
virus 
also he said the same sharing techniques which make computer 
networks vulnerable to virus attack can also be responsible for 
breakthroughs in electronics and telecommunications technology

members of the house and senate are likely to 
cheer themselves hoarse when solidarity leader lech walesa 
addresses a joint meeting of congress on wednesday 
but the rush of events in walesas poland and across eastern 
europe has taken on a life of its own and theres little american 
lawmakers can do but shout encouragement 
like sports fans jamming a coliseum they are able to cheer 
their team but unable to get into the game the one exception an 
aid package for poland and hungary has been debated for months but 
could be approved just in time for walesas speech 
in many respects the flood of events in eastern europe has 
stunned the capital like the sudden crumbling of a giant dam long 
thought to be indestructible but revealed as old and poorly 
maintained 
the events 
the symbolic destruction of the ultimate icon of communisms 
grip on eastern europe the berlin wall 
the mass exodus of east german citizens and tumultuous 
antigovernment demonstrations on east german streets 
the democratic tide in hungary and the removal of its section 
of the iron curtain 
the advance of democratic institutions in poland under walesas 
solidarity union 
the reform program of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
with its underpinnings of economic restructuring and a new openness 
in thought and speech 
the cheers came quickly but with them came words of caution 
we should be clear but prudent in our own actions said 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas we should not do 
anything at this point which might needlessly add fuel to the 
fire 
the one issue rushing to the surface in the aftermath of the 
east german decision to open its borders to all wanting to leave is 
the possibility that it will prove the first step toward the 
reunification of the two germanies 
many members of congress believe thats an issue far too hot for 
american involvement 
the future of east and west germany is something congress should 
think hard about dole said adding that its far too early to do 
more than think 
they are not issues for heated rhetoric right now dole said 
another caution came from senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine 
this is a historic event he said of the decision to open 
east german borders it can be made even more so if the east 
german government now acts to tear the wall down only then will we 
know that their decision has lasting substance and meaning 
some in congress believe the time is coming to address the issue 
of drastically reducing the american troop presence in eastern 
europe 
many others say that is decidedly premature 
they point out that the military forces of the soviet union and 
of the warsaw pact for that matter remain intact and formidable 
arms control negotiations both in nuclear and conventional 
arms are said to be making important progress but they are far 
from complete 
reducing us troop strength or lowering natos military 
shield are unlikely events short of stunningly successful arms 
control negotiations and stability on the european continent 
in the one area where congress is prepared to do something 
concrete aid to poland and hungary the rhetoric has been strong 
and the action slow 
by the time walesa takes the podium in the house congress may 
have passed legislation authorizing several hundred million dollars 
in aid to polands noncommunist government and to hungary as well 
but in contrast to the dazzling speed of events in eastern 
europe the aid bill has been traveling through the capitols 
marble halls with the pace of an overweight snail its passage 
marked with partisan haggling over the price 
by and large democrats have advocated far higher spending 
levels than republicans 
the two days before walesas speech will be marked by senate 
debate over a threeyear democratic plan costing nearly 1 billion 
and a more modest republican package a little more than half as 
expensive 
democrats have criticized president bush as being overly 
timid on the whole subject 
many senate democrats said the republicans had embarrassed 
congress by attempting for a time to tie the polandhungary aid 
package to a totally unrelated domestic political controversy the 
capital gains tax cut 
but if polands staunchest supporters on capitol hill have their 
way walesa and the aid package will arrive together

nasa this month plans to embark on a 400 
million mission during which a satellite will study radiation left 
from the big bang the 15billionyearold blast that 
scientists say created the universe 
the space agency hopes the launch will produce the most 
comprehensive observations ever of the early universe and the 
processes that shaped it to form stars and galaxies 
the 150 million cosmic background explorer a 16by28foot 
satellite will be boosted into orbit 559 miles above earth by 
nasas last unmanned rocket said george diller an agency 
spokesman 
the vandenberg air force base launch had been scheduled for 
friday but has been delayed until at least nov 19 to replace a 
malfunctioning guidance computer on the twostage delta rocket 
the 116foot rocket that will lift the 5000pound explorer into 
orbit will be the 184th delta launched by the national aeronautics 
and space administration and the last expendable rocket nasa will 
ever launch diller said 
nasa stopped buying rockets in the early 1980s deciding to 
launch payloads from shuttles after its booster inventory was 
exhausted after the 1986 challenger explosion nasa said it was 
wrong to rely on the shuttle then president reagan ordered the 
agency to stop launching commercial payloads and give such business 
to private industry 
after a 30day shakedown the solarpowered explorer will spend 
up to two years using three sensitive detectors to study how the 
universe and its stars and galaxies developed program scientist 
larry caroff said from washington 
the instruments will measure cosmic background radiation 
such radiation is different than dangerous ionizing radiation it 
includes microwaves infrared light and submillimeter radiation 
left over from the big bang the gargantuan explosion that 
scientists believe was the fireball of creation 
if god created the universe he or she did it about 15 billion 
years ago and did it with a bang caroff said 
in an instant a single point of matter expanded explosively 
into a hot dense and extraordinarily uniform sphere of gas 
containing electrically charged particles according to the theory 
think of a sphere with us at the center caroff said the 
surface is moving away from us very fast glowing and emitting 
radiation that sphere is the hot gas characteristic of the early 
universe we have to look very very far back in time which means 
very far out in the universe to see that hot surface 
by measuring cosmic background radiation the explorer will look 
back to certain times in the history of the universe he explained 
one of explorers instruments will measure infrared light or 
heat emitted when the first atoms are believed to have formed 
500000 years after the big bang that will help scientists learn 
if between three minutes to 500000 years after the big bang the 
universe was shaped by exotic phenomena such as black holes which 
are so dense their gravity sucks in light 
the satellites microwave sensor will look for differences in 
the brightness of cosmic background radiation to determine if the 
big bangs fireball was equally bright in all directions 
out of that extraordinarily uniform collection of hot matter 
eventually had to come galaxies and stars what is obviously a 
very lumpy distribution of matter caroff said the seeds of 
that lumpiness must have been present in the early universe and 
the microwave instrument is meant to look for those seeds 
explorers third sensor will search for a burst of luminous 
infrared and submillimeter radiation that scientists believed was 
produced when the first stars and galaxies formed 200 million years 
after the big bang 
telescopes can see distant galaxies a few billion years back 
in time but nothing like this caroff said this will be the 
first time anyone will be able to see evidence of the formation of 
the first galaxies 
caroff said the explorer missions cost includes 150 million 
for the satellite and sensors 70 million for the rocket and 
launch and 160 million for manpower at nasas goddard space flight 
center in maryland about 20 million is for operations and data 
analysis through the end of the mission

new hampshire primary watchers always wary 
of threats to their states earliestinthenation presidential 
primary have turned their eyes westward toward the 
biggestinthenation california 
rich hip and populated california is tired of having little 
say in the presidential nominating process because the nominees 
usually have been chosen long before californians vote in june 
come january legislators in the delegateloaded state will 
reconsider a proposal to move the states primary to early march 
shortly after new hampshires 
will californias 27 million people mute new hampshires 1 
million will its multiple media markets lure commentators 
attention from the grass roots persontoperson struggle here 
absolutely not it will have just the opposite effect said 
robert craig a university of new hampshire political analyst 
all you have to do is ask yourself whether youd like to be on 
the cover of time or newsweek four days before the california 
primary 
state democratic chairman joseph grandmaison and his republican 
counterpart rhona charbonneau agree 
were a small close state charbonneau said the media 
will still be here its tradition and maybe superstition 
since 1952 no one has been elected president without winning 
new hampshire 
supporters say new hampshires primary and more recently 
iowas party caucuses should come early because personal contacts 
are more effective than sound bytes in small states 
they say the grassroots campaigning that has catapulted 
longshots to victory is impossible in a huge state like california 
or a regional primary like super tuesday in the south in 1988 
people make a mistake thinking that the only thing new 
hampshire has going for it is its early date said concord lawyer 
thomas rath who ran bob doles 1988 primary campaign in new 
hampshire 
he said the willingness of people in new hampshire to get 
involved early their tightknit communities and the earned 
media exposure makes a victory worth billions in advertising in 
california 
you cant break through in a state like california rath 
said if youre a jimmy carter or a bob dole running against the 
quasiincumbent figure you need a place thats going to dent that 
frontrunners armor george mcgovern did it in 1972 and gary hart 
did it in 1984 
robert beckel campaign manager for democratic presidential 
nominee walter mondale in 1984 also has said a california switch 
would discourage longshots and attract nationally wellknown 
candidates 
democratic national committee chairman ron brown didnt go that 
far but in a recent visit to new hampshire he said the influence 
of new hampshire and iowa was grossly overrated and praised 
californias efforts to have its contest earlier 
beckel maintains that having the option of scoring a major 
victory in california might make a candidate less inclined to sweat 
it out in iowa and new hampshire 
rath dismissed the notion that candidates would campaign in 
california on new hampshire time 
the week between the iowa caucuses and the new hampshire 
primary in 1988 was probably the political super bowl of all time 
in this state he said and california a week after wont 
change anything 
new hampshire rath said is too riveted in the nations 
political consciousness 
dayton duncan press secretary for massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis in the latter part of his 1988 campaign and a top mondale 
spokesman in 1984 agrees 
obviously theyll have to spend a lot of time in california 
but its too big a state to campaign intensively the way you can in 
new hampshire he said the best way for you to get a head 
start in california is to do well in new hampshire 
duncan said california and super tuesday are too big to organize 
at the grassroots level and too expensive to advertise in the 
shortest route to becoming known is to win the caucuses and 
primaries before them he said 
ron kaufman regional political director for george bushs 1988 
campaign said an early california primary will go much the same 
way as super tuesday that was meant to diminish the impact of new 
hampshire and iowa 
but kaufman now a white house aide said it had the opposite 
effect 
the biggest single thing that helped michael dukakis in super 
tuesday was winning new hampshire kaufman said

former secretary of state george p shultz 
who stunned the bush administration by announcing he supports 
legalizing drugs says hes treading an unpopular path that no 
politician wants to take not for a minute 
many of the leading drug legalization advocates arent in 
government posts but some public officials put their careers on 
the line by taking the unpopular stance or by calling for a close 
look at the legalization argument long before shultz stepped into 
the controversy 
thus far their ventures dont appear to have hurt their careers 
shultzs pronouncement last month contends the war on drugs is 
futile 
it seems to me were not really going to get anywhere until we 
can take the criminality out of the drug business and the 
incentives for criminality out of it he said in a column in the 
wall street journal an adaptation of an earlier speech 
frankly the only way i can think of to accomplish this is to 
make it possible for addicts to buy drugs at some regulated place 
at a price that approximates their cost he wrote we need at 
least to consider and examine forms of controlled legalization of 
drugs 
the position drew hoots from white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater 
whoa hes been out on the west coast too long hasnt he the 
guy slips into retirement and right away he starts saying things 
that are strange fitzwater said 
national drug control strategy director william j bennett 
called legalization a dopey idea and a moral disaster 
shultz acknowledged that he was shouting into the breeze here 
as far as what were doing now 
no politician wants to say what i just said not for a 
minute 
the most prominent politician currently holding office who has 
advocated some form of legalization is baltimore mayor kurt 
schmoke a former prosecutor who wants to change attitudes about 
drug addiction from a crime problem to a public health problem 
but hes not alone 
other public officials who have supported legalization or at 
least a civil and indepth discussion of the possibility include 
hartford conn mayor carrie saxon perry mercer county nj 
executive bill mathesius columbia mo deputy chief of police 
carroll highbarger and new york state sen joseph l galiber of 
the bronx 
their careers havent collapsed 
perry who testified before congress last year that she supports 
schmokes views was just reelected by a 21 margin over her 
republican opponent 
mathesius a former federal and county prosecutor was being 
touted as a possible state attorney general if rep james courter 
a republican had won the governorship courter however lost to 
democratic rep james j florio 
mathesius whose county includes trenton and who next faces the 
voters in 1991 said public reaction to his prolegalization stance 
has been running 201 in favor among those who have taken the 
time and trouble to write i was surprised 
highbarger was chief of detectives in columbia when he started 
calling for a study of legalization 1 years ago since then hes 
been promoted to deputy chief of the department 
some legalization advocates say san jose calif police chief 
joseph mcnamara is in their camp but he denies it 
weve had 70 years of glorious failure and we really need to 
look for different ways to deal with the drug problem mcnamara 
said several years ago the focus he said should be diverted 
somewhat from law enforcement to increased prevention and treatment 
efforts to reduce demand 
i think its a big jump from being critical to legalization 
especially when there are no definitions of what form legalization 
will take mcnamara said in an interview 
bennett and attorney general dick thornburgh have said that law 
enforcement alone cant solve the problem bushs drug strategy 
reflects those views in words but mcnamara noted that the 
appropriations request still devotes the biggest bucks to law 
enforcement 
if this socalled war flops after three years i think there 
will be some massive changes in public policies and theyll be 
forced to be open to other ideas such as legalization mcnamara 
said 
highbarger says the problem with drug prohibition is that 
enforcement is simply not working 
were pouring money down a rathole he said in an interview 
drugs get cheaper every year that tells you how good our 
enforcement effort is 
highbarger joked that the latest antidrug program in columbia 
a city of 70000 in a metropolitan area of 125000 where crack has 
been the major problem is winter 
at 35 degrees and a 35 mph wind its harder to stand out on 
the street corner selling drugs he said laughing thats our 
current program and its working

backers of a shrine to the likes of elvis 
presley little richard and the beatles are frantically trying to 
drum up enough money to build the rock and roll hall of fame and 
museum 
wednesday is the deadline for raising the 40 million needed to 
build the structure which would rise in downtown cleveland near 
the cuyahoga river by 1992 
local promoters figure about 600000 people would push through 
the turnstiles of the pyramidshaped glassandsteel complex each 
year and spend 85 million in restaurants hotels and souvenir 
shops 
organizers canvassing corporate cleveland for donations expect 
to meet the fundraising goal in cash and pledges said the 
projects development director john zoilo 
its gone through some rough stages however now its on firm 
financial footing zoilo said were confident well be there 
were closing the gap every day 
as of sunday more than 37 million was collected in cash and 
pledges from state local and federal governments and from private 
companies and philanthropists said larry thompson rock hall 
director in cleveland 
last week a local nightclub and restaurant developer jeffrey 
jacobs offered to chip in up to 500000 
three years ago cleveland beat out seven other cities for the 
project sponsored by the new yorkbased rock and roll hall of fame 
foundation which also set the funding deadline 
since 1986 the foundation comprised of recording industry 
executives and artists promoters and managers has inducted 
performers into a hall of fame though the organization lacked a 
building even after the hall is built induction ceremonies 
probably would remain in new york said suzan evans the 
foundations executive director 
the rust belt city whose main claim to musical fame has been its 
highly regarded symphony orchestra may seem an unlikely site to 
honor rock n roll its few native rockers include the ponitails 
the edsels the outsiders the james gang and the raspberries 
but promoters say cleveland has earned huey lewis accolade as 
the heart of rock n roll noting the citys residents lead 
the nation in per capita record purchases and have a history of 
supporting rock music 
the citys rock heyday was in the 1950s when wjwam disc jockey 
alan freed dubbed himself moon dog and began broadcasting his 
nightly show 
boosters claim cleveland was the scene of the first big rock 
concert the moon dog coronation ball featuring the dominoes earl 
bostwick and others for which promoters freed and leo mintz sold 
twice as many tickets as there were seats 
when cleveland was chosen as site for the hall community 
enthusiasm and pledges of support flowed even mayor george 
voinovich a phil collins fan and gov richard celeste donned hall 
of fame sweatshirts and campaigned for the project 
but support sputtered one local campaign that sought individual 
donations of 15 or more produced only 300000 the only rock 
group to donate was the who which has promised about 1 million 
from its concert tour this year said zoilo 
last month a 69 million federal urban development action 
grant considered a key piece in the funding fell through 
ms evans declined to say if the foundation would pull the plug 
on the cleveland hall if boosters dont raise 40 million 
were still very optimistic about cleveland she said 
their financial information will be analyzed 
other cities that courted the project were san francisco 
chicago nashville philadelphia new orleans new york and 
memphis tenn 
local economists said the project could do for cleveland what 
the country music hall of fame does for nashville tenn where 
about 350000 people a year pay 650 to stroll past banjoes 
spangled suits recording equipment and other trade artifacts

an agriculture department analysis shows total 
us grain production is so huge that yeartoyear changes in the 
pattern send tremors throughout the world 
when us crop production falters there is a good chance that 
global figures also will show a decline and when there are bumper 
us harvests particularly of feed grains the world stockpile is 
fatter 
last week the usda estimated this falls corn harvest the 
keystone of total us grain output at 759 billion bushels up 
54 percent from the droughtsavaged 1988 harvest 
put into international terms the us corn crop was 1928 
million metric tons allowing for about 2205 pounds per ton there 
are approximately 394 bushels of corn in each ton or 367 
bushels of wheat or soybeans 
a related supplyanddemand report showed total us grain 
production this year at more than 2838 million metric tons which 
includes corn output that is up sharply from 2041 million tons in 
1988 
the total includes wheat coarse grains such as corn sorghum 
oats and barley and milled rice it does not include us soybean 
production estimated at 527 million tons this year 
according to the analysis global production of grain in the 
198990 year a composite of dates for various crops is 
projected at about 1671 billion tons of which the us share of 
2838 million would represent about 17 percent 
last year when world grain output was 1559 billion tons the 
us share was 2041 million or 13 percent which reflected the 
drought reductions of 1988 
after totaling all production and deducting how much grain will 
be used in the year ahead the usda report said that by the end of 
the current season in 1990 the world will have about 2924 million 
tons of grain left over 
that would be down from 3087 million tons left in the global 
pantry this year and 4039 million tons remaining in inventories in 
1988 
of the total yearend grain stockpiles the united states is 
expected to have almost 74 million tons in 1990 or about 25 
percent of the world total 
this year with a global inventory of 3087 million tons of 
grain the united states accounted for 86 million tons or 28 
percent and in 1988 with a world inventory of 4039 million tons 
the us share was 1694 million tons 42 percent of the worlds 
total 
as the figures show the united states has borne the brunt of 
grain stockpile reduction while inventories in other countries 
have dropped only slightly 
this year for example the global reduction in yearend stocks 
from 1988 was about 952 million tons the united states accounted 
for 854 million tons of the yeartoyear decline 
if the 1990 projection holds true there will be a further 
global reduction of 163 million tons with the united states 
accounting for 12 million 
thus for the moment at least the major burden of holding 
surplus grain inventories has been shifted from the united states 
to other countries how that stacks up a year or two from now will 
depend on the weather and farmers reactions to market developments 
it will also depend on trade policies that affect exports and 
domestic consumption of grains in scores of countries that buy from 
american farmers or compete with them for export markets

the agriculture department says plans are 
being made for agricultural trade and development missions to 
pakistan and bangladesh 
undersecretary richard crowder said a mission also will be sent 
to india which had been visited earlier under trade mission 
program no dates have been set he said 
these three south asian countries imported 1 billion worth of 
us agricultural products last year crowder said in his recent 
announcement 
in addition pakistan and bangladesh are two of our largest 
food aid recipients these missions offer an excellent opportunity 
to review all us trade and development programs and make 
recommendations for improved coordination with the three 
countries 
the missions will include representatives from the departments 
of agriculture and state and the us agency for international 
development three to six private representatives also will be 
selected for each team 
congress authorized the missions program two years ago to 
encourage greater us private sector and foreign country 
participation in us agricultural trade and development 
activities sixteen countries have been visited or are planned 
under the program

based on the comparable level for shorn wool 
and the support for shorn wool is derived under a formula 
prescribed in the law based on current readings the 1990 support 
for shorn wool will be 182 per pound compared with 177 this 
year

the states top police officer resigned 
under fire over secret taping of prisoners telephone calls that 
defense attorneys say could be grounds for retrial of criminal 
cases as far back as 1980 
the taping should not have been done was wrong and cannot be 
tolerated gov william a oneill said sunday in announcing the 
resignation of cmdr lester j forst 
do i believe it was done with intent and malice aforethought 
the answer to that is probably not 
i felt that i had responsibility to make sure that the 
people in the state of connecticut have total trust in the state 
police department and certainly that their rights are protected 
forsts resignation as state police commander and public saftey 
commissioner came less than a week after it was revealed that 
officers recorded all incoming and outgoing calls at the 12 
regional state police barracks 
the taping may have started nine years ago attorneys said 
in a foursentence letter to the governor the 54yearold forst 
described his departure after eight years in the 81000ayear job 
as a resignation he denied violating any laws and said he was 
unaware of the taping 
oneill named former hartford police chief bernard r sullivan 
46 to replace forst sullivan has been security director for the 
hartford insurance company since july 
the governor ordered an halt to taping of attorneyclient calls 
after the taping was reported last week by the hartford courant 
a defense lawyers organization filed a classaction lawsuit 
contending that police could have illegally gathered evidence from 
tapes of attorneyclient calls if that is proven prosecutions 
could be endangered the lawyers said in announcing the federal 
suit seeking money damages for those whose conversations were taped 
i would think that pending cases are subject to dismissal and 
that convictions are likely to be overturned said margaret levy 
a defense attorney 
joseph keefe president of the connecticut criminal defense 
lawyers association predicted it is unlikely a conviction would 
be overturned unless illegally obtained information led to the 
conviction 
state police officials have said calls were taped so officers 
would have a record of difficulttounderstand emergency calls and 
as a record in case callers complained about the way they were 
handled 
the governors legal counsel the attorney general and the chief 
states attorney are examining state police taping policies as 
well as those at local police departments in addition the us 
attorney for connecticut and the fbi are investigating whether the 
taping violated federal wiretap laws 
in his resignation letter forst said i have not violated any 
laws nor have i condoned any wrongdoing however it has been my 
training for over 27 years to serve the best interests of the state 
of connecticut and the department of public safety

abortionrights activists are pledging to 
channel their energy from last weeks election victories into 1990 
political campaigns to assure that women continue to have freedom 
of choice 
this will be the issue of 1990 molly yard president of the 
national organization for women told more than 150000 
abortionrights activists who rallied sunday in the nations 
capital 
the washington gathering was the largest in a string of 
prochoice rallies and other events held nationwide sunday 
antichoice is our berlin wall and together we will make it 
fall forever author and activist gloria steinem told about 1300 
people in atlanta 
in washington prochoice democratic and republican politicians 
joined a parade of entertainers to lead a nearly fivehour rally on 
a sunny mild autumn day the crowd of demonstrators waving signs 
and shouting prochoice slogans stretched from the steps of the 
lincoln memorial along the reflecting pool to the washington 
monument 
galvanized by election victories for prochoice candidates 
earlier this month in virginia and new jersey demonstrators were 
encouraged that politicians wouldnt be able to ignore them in the 
next round of elections 
i urge all of you to turn up the heat across the nation 
said sen alan cranston dcalif who said a bill would be 
introduced in congress later this year to prohibit states from 
interfering with womens right to abortion 
he and other prochoice lawmakers from capitol hill and 
statehouses across the country urged activists to work for 
candidates who pledge to preserve abortion rights for women 
the action is in the states and we are on board there and 
ready said iowa lt gov joann zimmerman a democrat running for 
governor we will fight to see that we have prochoice candidates 
there are 34 senate seats and 36 governors offices up for 
election next year 
rally organizers said the police count of 150000 attending the 
rally was low estimating the crowd at twice that number among the 
celebrities at the rally were singers helen reddy pete seeger 
peter yarrow and mary travers and actress ruby dee 
about 30 antiabortion demonstrators gathered near the lincoln 
memorial in an area roped off from the prochoice demonstrators a 
few carried signs and one demonstrator used a megaphone to address 
abortionrights activists who drowned him out with their own 
prochoice chants 
across the country thousands of other prochoice activists 
gathered at similar rallies and other events including a sunrise 
service in kennebunk maine near president bushs vacation retreat 
an abortionrights demonstration in april drew hundreds of 
thousands 300000 by police estimates and 600000 by the 
organizers count to the capital in anticipation of a supreme 
court ruling in a missouri abortion case 
soon after the court gave broad authority to states to restrict 
womens rights to terminate their pregnancies though it left 
intact its landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion 
the court will hear three cases later this month and in december 
seeking to further restrict a womans right to abortion 
the supreme court did us a great favor said mary ann baker 
of youngstown ohio it got us off our complacent behinds

at 55 east berliner hedda zenter plans to apply 
for her first passport it may never take her any further than 
another day trip to west berlin but it will mark the end of nearly 
30 years of frustrated hopes 
my dream is to see paris to buy an english newspaper said 
mrs zenter but to be here that too was unbelievable 
mrs zenter was one of about 1 million east germans who took 
their first chance sunday to pass freely to the western side of her 
city 
she visited the gravesites of departed friends strolled through 
the zoo stopping to nibble a sandwich brought in her bag then 
crowded with thousands of others for a glimpse of west german 
president richard von weizsaecker outside west berlins historic 
gedaechtniskirche the memorial church 
with no immediate relatives in west berlin mrs zedda is among 
millions of east germans for whom the berlin wall was impenetrable 
applications to visit an elderly cousin last seen a few weeks 
before the wall went up in 1961 were repeatedly turned down by the 
east german authorities who say a cousin does not qualify as a 
close relation 
before east germany scrapped travel restrictions last week 
family ties were one of the few grounds for applying to make a trip 
mrs zenter will never see her cousin now he died six months 
ago 
the prospects of seeing paris are also remote 
a universitytrained physical education teacher now working as 
a therapist at a clinic in east berlin mrs zenter earns 840 east 
german marks a month 
at the exchange rate set by east germany thats about 450 a 
month at the unofficial rate that reflects its actual worth the 
sum is about 45 
as for many others the communist governments momentous 
political change of heart may have come too late for mrs zenter 
the thirty years that have gone were the prime of my life 
she said i wouldnt try to live outside east germany now i have 
a house my daughter is there my job is there these are the 
things that tie but i can perhaps travel 
that will need another revolution a transformed east german 
economy to turn her earnings into hard currency 
but mrs zenter still has hopes for nearly a decade she has 
studied english at home listening to british broadcasting corp 
programs 
on sunday shed had her first chance to try it out on a native 
englishspeaker you understand me thats marvellous she told 
a reporter 
for years too shes been writing to a pen pal in canada in 
english 
most of the friends replies never reached her now she thinks 
the authorities will stop interfering with the mail 
and if she never goes any further walking through a checkpoint 
in the berlin wall after simply waving an identify card at east 
german border guards spelled freedom 
i feel much freer she said everything has changed and 
the change came from the bottom from the people and it was hard 
and bitterly fought for

secretary of state james a baker iii prepares 
to call for a decisive hemispheric stand against panamas gen 
manuel antonio noriega as foreign ministers from the organization 
of american states gather here today 
a highlight of the meeting is expected to be the admission of 
canada as the 32nd oas member effective jan 1 there also is some 
sentiment in support of readmitting cuba 
the oas expelled the government of president fidel castro in 
1962 on grounds that the countrys marxistleninist philosophy is 
incompatible with oas principles 
oas foreign ministers usually convene only once a year but the 
panama crisis has prompted four special oas sessions since may an 
oas commission appointed in may was unable to fulfill its mandate 
of arranging a democratic transfer of power in panama 
us officials said baker was expected to deliver a tough speech 
condemning the panamanian government but it was not clear whether 
he would make specific proposals 
the inaugural session was scheduled for this morning and 
bakers remarks were to be delivered in late afternoon 
the panama crisis arose six months ago when panamanian 
authorities threw out the returns from national elections amid 
widespread allegations of fraud a noriega crony francisco 
rodriguez was sworn in sept 1 as the unelected president 
the united states has been the strongest proponent of decisive 
action against noriega but other oas countries maintain that the 
group should stay out of what is an essentially internal panamanian 
matter 
also on the oas agenda is nicaraguas scheduled feb 25 
presidential election the meeting is expected to produce numerous 
calls for a free and fair election process 
cuba has been sharply critical of the oas over the years 
looking on the organization as an instrument of us foreign 
policy but seven leading latin american democracies called last 
month for cubas readmission to the oas and cuba has said its 
ready to accept 
cuba has far more diplomatic support in the hemisphere than at 
any time since it was expelled from the oas 27 years ago 
the united states has lobbied hard against cubas readmission 
citing alleged cuban support for subversion in central american and 
reported human rights abuses 
cubas readmission would require a twothirds vote of member 
nations in attendance

peter fechter was 18 when he was gunned down by 
east german border guards at the berlin wall and left to die with 
the wall now crumbling 27 years later his mother says he did not 
die in vain 
at the time his ordeal became a symbol of the cruelty of the 
berlin wall and the people who guarded it 
margarethe fechter remembers her only son as a funloving hard 
worker engaged to be married a yellowed blackandwhite 
photograph of him still hangs in her cramped apartment in east 
berlins weissensee district 
fechter was among the first of at least 80 victims killed along 
the barrier communist east germany began erecting aug 13 1961 to 
isolate its part of the former german capital and keep its citizens 
from fleeing to the west 
his was among the most horrifying of deaths at the wall 
it was senseless his 78yearold mother said amid the 1950s 
furnishings of her apartment where her son had lived 
on aug 17 1962 fechter was part of a work detachment 
reinforcing a stretch of the wall 
i was always there cooking meals his mother a widowed 
seamstress recalled in an interview they used to sit on top of 
the wall laughing and joking 
one day while they were sitting on the wall a woman went to 
her balcony in an east berlin building overlooking the construction 
site his mother said two armed border guards had a watchpost in 
the same house 
she shouted to them are you daydreaming up there cant you 
see there are two pigs trying to flee over there mrs fechter 
said 
struck by a machinegun volley fechter fell to the east german 
side of the wall he was ignored for 50 minutes and bled to death 
too weak to pick up bandages thrown over by west german police 
border guards later dragged him away by his feet 
they left him lying there they let him bleed to death his 
mother says they wouldnt let us get near him 
it was gruesome he kept on crying mommy mommy they 
treated him like cattle 
the man believed to have fired the deadly shots emerged from the 
building after two hours he was attacked by bystanders 
he was screaming he wasnt it but everybody saw he did it 
says mrs fechter 
i didnt know how to tell my husband she continued he 
cried like a child seven weeks later i was attending his funeral 
too 
now east germans suddenly can travel freely to the west and new 
crossings are being opened in the wall 
says magarethe fechter those who died helped bring this 
about 
west berlin police have registered 80 deaths including 61 
shootings by east german authorities since the wall went up the 
actual toll is believed to be higher 
more than 5000 east germans successfully escaped across the 
wall about 3300 wouldbe escapees were arrested according to 
west berlin police 
guenter litfin a young east berliner became the first victim 
on aug 21 1961 he was shot trying to swim to the west berlin 
side of the spree river after climbing over the wall 
the last victim was winfried freudenberg who apparently fell to 
his death from a homemade hotair balloon after reaching west 
berlin territory on march 8 chris gueffroy a 20yearold east 
berlin waiter was the last one shot while fleeing he was killed 
feb 5 
there were also spectacular escapes as the urge to flee 
sometimes triggered desperate ingenuity 
twice in 1963 westerners brought out girlfriends by driving 
lowslung speedsters under the barriers at berlin checkpoints the 
east germans later installed vertical bars to stop such escapes 
fiftyseven people fled in 1964 through a 145yard tunnel that 
emerged in an unused west berlin bakery

the nuclearfree zone movement has been 
trying for a decade to be taken seriously now it has some evidence 
of success a lawsuit by the federal government 
the bush administration seeks to overturn major portions of 
oaklands 1988 nuclearfree initiative that could affect a navy 
base a department of energy office and other federal installations 
it was the first government lawsuit against any of the more than 
160 measures passed around the nation during the last decade 
declaring in varying terms that nuclear weapons were unwelcome 
within their jurisdictions 
most of the measures are symbolic either by design or by 
location in a place without nuclear connections the trend in 
recent years has been toward more specific and binding proposals 
which have occasionally provoked opposition from potentially 
affected local businesses 
in case involving the federal lawsuit there is a good chance 
the government will succeed at least partially 
at issue is an oakland ordinance that can be interpreted as 
asserting local authority over a variety of decisions affecting 
nuclear weapons an area in which courts have given the federal 
government much power 
the provisions are broad and mandatory it was passed in a city 
of 350000 that is home to a navy supply center for the pacific 
fleet and a department of energy office that oversees nuclear 
weapons research at nearby lawrence livermore laboratory also 
many other area military bases ship materials through oakland 
passed by voter initiative in november 1988 the measure 
forbids all nuclear weapons work including research 
production or storage of weapons or their components after 
november 1990 
requires any shipment of radioactive material through oakland 
to be disclosed in advance to the city which would choose the 
safest routes 
prohibits the city from contracting with or investing in any 
nuclear weaponsmakers unless no reasonable alternatives exist 
the contracting and investment provisions borrowed from the 
antiapartheid movement are the key to the measure said wilson 
riles jr the only city council member to support the initiative 
before it passed 
he said they already have led the city to reduce substantially 
its investments in federal treasury bills and offer a promising 
model to other communities 
riles said he believed the two provisions were on firm legal 
ground because similar bans on south african products have been 
upheld in court 
oakland is at a critical point in this new turn in the peace 
movement he said the federal government has realized this and 
i think thats why theyre trying to stop it 
justice department spokeswoman amy brown said the us dostrict 
court lawsuit filed in september on behalf of the navy and engery 
department was intended to respond to a unique local problem not 
to stop a movement or send a message to other jurisdictions 
the lawsuit contends the ordinance interferes with the 
governments exclusive authority over national defense and nuclear 
energy creates undue burdens on interstate commerce and conflicts 
with laws on military secrecy and shipments of hazardous materials 
so far the city has tried to avoid or at least minimize any 
confrontation 
the city council passed a resolution saying the investment ban 
did not apply to pensions the restrictions on transportation did 
not cover state or federal highways and the disclosure 
requirements did not apply to military secrets 
but the city is standing firm on the bottomline issue of local 
authority 
we do feel we have the authority to regulate what goes through 
our city streets to determine who we want to contract with 
getting some control over what happens in our city said city 
attorney jayne williams 
we dont have the power to change national priorities added 
riles but as individuals and as a collection of individuals in a 
free democracy we have the right in peacetime to decide where our 
resources will be spent and what happens in our communities

federal support for the nations 24 tribally 
controlled colleges has steadily dwindled during the 1980s and is 
now woefully insufficient according to a study 
many such colleges serving about 4400 reservation indians 
are forced to carry on their work in trailers and abandoned 
government buildings that other colleges would have hauled away or 
bulldozed over 20 years ago the carnegie foundation for the 
advancement of teaching concluded in a report released sunday 
such poor facilities not only restrict learning but also make 
a powerful statement of neglect said the report tribal 
colleges shaping the future of native americans 
the report by paul boyer a journalism instructor at california 
state university at sacramento is the first study of tribal 
colleges which appeared 21 years ago at the height of the 
civilrights movement 
tribal colleges today suffer from low faculty salaries a high 
teacher turnover rate and poorly equipped libraries and other 
facilities largely because washington has consistently failed to 
provide all the funds it had promised boyer wrote 
nevertheless tribal colleges quickly have become pillars of 
strength and hope for the indian community providing social and 
economic counseling and giving students who dropped out of 
mainstream colleges a second chance in a more nurturing 
environment the report said 
eightysix percent of tribal college students who transfer to 
mainstream colleges complete their education in contrast the 
approximately 90000 students who start college in nonindian 
schools have a 90 percent dropout rate 
the oldest and largest navajo community college in tsaile 
ariz was founded in 1968 and enrolls more than 1000 students 
the others are in montana north dakota south dakota california 
oregon nebraska minnesota wisconsin illinois and elsewhere in 
arizona nearly all are twoyear colleges 
according to the report the federal government has had a policy 
of benign neglect toward these institutions the report also 
called on states and private foundations to help the colleges

some private groups are helping in washington today the 
macarthur foundation announced a 57 million grant to help improve 
educational and economic opportunities for indians including 3 
million to 18 triballycontrolled colleges 
american indians are among the nations poorest citizens yet 
their welfare generally has been overlooked by private 
foundations said adele simmons foundation president 
a small amount of money goes a long way at the tribal 
colleges and this new support is a real morale booster said 
janine windyboy president of little big horn college in crow 
agency mont 
us west another private foundation announced plans to send 
tribal college presidents for a training program at harvard 
universitys institute of educational management 
</TEXT>

eleven years ago congress authorized 4000 for each fulltime 
equivalent student at tribal colleges later raising it to 5825 
but actual appropriations never approached those figures the 
report said 
it said that in 1980 when there were only about 1700 students 
in tribal colleges the federal government distributed 5 million 
about 3000 per student under the tribally controlled community 
college act 
by 1989 with enrollments up nearly threefold the 
appropriation climbed to 85 million but the amount generated for 
each student declined to 1900 in effect tribal colleges are 
being penalized for their own success the study said 
twelve of the colleges are fully accredited and eight are 
candidates for accreditation according to the report 
clearly tribal colleges are not marginal institutions that 
have been given a break it said 
unlike past education efforts that have frequently encouraged 
indians to deny their heritage a central mission of tribal 
colleges has been to help tribes reclaim their cultural 
heritage wrote foundation president ernest l boyer in a 
foreword to the study 
since their beginnings many have offered tutoring programs in 
building basic skills and provide active counseling 
typical students are over age 30 female and nearly all live on 
reservations many attend tribal colleges after failing at 
traditional colleges 
college presidents are nearly all indians and all are chartered 
and controlled by tribal advisory and governing boards 
but most faculty are nonindian and low pay and isolation have 
led to a high turnover the report said

egon krenzs gamble that an open door policy would 
not backfire has paid off all but a few of the millions of east 
germans who flooded west germany over the weekend returned home 
in charge of a faltering economy and a government under siege by 
calls for democracy east germanys new communist leader created a 
safety valve by opening the doors to the west the lack of freedom 
to travel to the west has been among the most bitter complaints of 
east germans 
more importantly krenz bought time for the political and 
economic reforms he has promised by boosting his credibility with 
east germans who had doubted the sincerity of his pledges 
guenter schabowski a member of the ruling politburo and east 
berlins communist party chief said the border opening proved the 
east german leadership was serious and decisive about reforms 
the needs of the people were clear to us and we knew that the 
decision entailed risks the staterun news agency adn quoted 
schabowski as saying he said he never feared the situation would 
get out of control that trust had been won back 
adn reported that east german officials had issued nearly 43 
million visas for travel to the west between thursday and late 
sunday 
west german officials said that of the more than 3 million east 
germans who poured in over the weekend only about 2 percent opted 
to remain under laws that guarantee automatic citizenship to east 
germans 
krenzs hand was forced by a combined challenge the flight of 
200000 east germans this year and massive street protests 
demanding reform 
to stem the flight of east germanys youngest and most talented 
workers krenz opened locked doors that had done much to fuel the 
exodus west 
in doing so he has also taken the pressure off czechoslovakia 
which had reluctantly become a conduit for tens of thousands of 
east german refugees who poured over its frontiers to the west in 
recent weeks 
pragues orthodox communist leaders have refused to join east 
germany hungary and poland in endorsing democratic change 
krenz gambled that a look at west germanys glittering economy 
would not permanently lure most east germans into deserting their 
homes and jobs 
the weekends visitors to the west went on a spending spree for 
fresh fruit and electronic gadgetry scarce back home then went 
back across the border 
the fallout from the massive influx to west germany is likely to 
increase pressure on the east german government to improve its 
peoples standard of living already the envy of many warsaw pact 
neighbors

a bicycle racer pedaled a 
helicopter into the air in the first successful flight of a 
humanpowered chopper according to university students who worked 
on the project 
its probably the last great aviation achievement around 
said neal saiki 23 a senior at the california state polytechnic 
university san luis obispo after sundays indoor test flight 
as cheers filled mott gymnasium the 100pound copter known as 
the da vinci iii hovered a few inches above the floor under the 
power of cyclist greg mcneil an aeronautical engineering major who 
races on the us cycling team 
the da vinci iii with a single 100foot blade is the fourth 
helicopter to be built by cal poly students since 1981 the last 
version the da vinci iib was damaged in may 
the helicopters are named after leonardo da vinci because he 
sketched a similar craft university spokesman bob anderson said 
humanpowered planes have flown but not helicopters the 
students said 
the helicopter has a single 100foot blade resting above the 
cockpit where the pedaler sits the seat and pedals swing freely in 
the center section rather than rest on the floor like previous 
models 
saiki who has worked on the project for more than two years 
said three improvements contributed to the success of the latest 
version 
we made it lighter we made the rotors straighter and we got a 
pilot with a better output saiki said 
but saiki conceded that people of the future will not pedal 
about in their own helicopters at least not copters like this one 
its far too big to ever be popular he said i mean it 
fills up the gym practically wall to wall

theres an awful lot of people that cook for pleasure 
nairne said after about a dozen people watched him demonstrate his

now to me a 250000 automobile is certainly not a toy 
said nairne a microphone clipped to his collar to amplify his 
sales pitch over the din at detroits cobo hall 
other toys included a newfangled stepladder home alarm 
systems a spongeaction cloth called the super shammy and lionel 
trains along with ferrari and lamborghini cars hot tubs saunas 
boats and jewelry 
there should have been more sport toys not a guy selling pots 
and pans thats not toys said paul wojtylko of gibraltar 
they could have had more things you dont see everyday 
for lee and birgit bowring of plymouth the question wasnt 
whether they wanted any of the opulent items including the furs 
they were admiring 
the question is the money bowring said swearing that they 
came just to look hopefully we wont buy said ms bowring 
pausing to look at her husband before adding unless its a fur

walesa arrives with his head high and his hand out applauded 
for forging the first noncommunist government in the warsaw pact 
and seeking money for its survival 
we are building an america of the east but that requires 
billions of dollars from the west walesa said in an interview 
before leaving poland 
walesas visit will give president bush and congress a chance to 
applaud in decibels and dollars the changes that are sweeping the 
soviet bloc and that led last week to the opening of the berlin 
wall 
there will be plenty of praise in washington for the mustachioed 
electrician who rocketed to world fame in august 1980 by clambering 
over another wall that around the gdansk shipyard where he led 
the strike that forged solidarity the first independent trade 
union in the communist bloc 
walesa is not likely to leave washington emptyhanded as 
congress and the administration hammer out a deal to send up to 
989 million over three years to bolster the sweeping reforms 
enacted in poland and hungary 
after leaving poland last friday walesas first stop was 
canada speaking sunday at a dinner hosted by bob white president 
of the canadian auto workers union walesa said that if the west 
doesnt enthusiastically support polands program for economic 
recovery it risks a brutal crackdown on political reforms sweeping 
eastern europe 
the bloody method used to crush the reform movement in china 
earlier this year is an excellent example of what could happen 
when the economic and political reforms do not go hand in hand 
walesa said 
walesa was to meet today with prime minister brian mulroney 
then he was to fly to washington to attend a white house reception 
tonight address an aflcio convention and become the first private 
foreign citizen in 175 years to address a joint meeting of congress 
before heading home walesa also was to visit new york chicago 
philadelphia and caracas venezuela 
walesa the pole best known in the west holds no government 
post preferring to remain head of the trade union he helped 
create steer through the repression of martial law and guide to 
control of the government 
the only previous foreigner without a government job to address 
congress was the marquis de lafayette who fought as a general in 
the american revolution and spoke to a joint meeting in 1824 said 
ray smock the house historian 
all the official hoopla could be old hat for a man who won the 
nobel prize for peace in 1983 but walesa said on the eve of his 
visit that one of his big worries was not having time for all the 
americans who want to meet him 
i cannot thank americans enough because it is physically 
impossible walesa told the associated press in an interview last 
week in gdansk any trip to the states shorter than one month is 
no good 
uppermost in walesas mind was the survival of the solidarity 
government headed by his former adviser tadeusz mazowecki 
to bolster that government walesa said we need columbuses 
from the states to discover poland to clear the trail 
then there will be an influx of millionaires because there is 
business to be done there said walesa describing a poland in 
need of rebuilding from top to bottom 
us aid is forthcoming but it may not be as much as walesa 
would like 
house and senate negotiators a week ago completed work on a 
compromise to send 533 million in fiscal 1990 to poland and 
hungary including a 200 million us contribution to a 1 billion 
international aid fund to help stabilize the polish currency as 
well as money for a 45 million program to promote private 
enterprise in poland

voters turned out in large numbers for 
municipal elections despite threats of violence from maoist rebels 
and spurned candidates of president alan garcias party unofficial 
returns showed today 
shining path guerrillas trying to thwart sundays balloting 
killed a candidate and blew up a church a school and power lines 
six other people were killed in attacks blamed on the rebels 
no overall figures were available but turnout was high in lima 
and other major cities in the capital authorities extended voting 
for two hours to accommodate lines 
early results from a few mountainous rebel strongholds did 
suggest some voters were frightened by rumored rebel threats to cut 
off the index fingers marked with indelible ink at polling 
stations of people who voted 
in ayacucho 240 miles southeast of lima 68 percent of the 
votes cast were blank according to unofficial returns 
soldiers armed with assault rifles patrolled the streets armed 
police and soldiers also provided heavy security at voting places 
political independent ricardo belmont won the mayoral race in 
lima with nearly 49 percent of the votes according to the returns 
defeating the democratic fronts juan inchaustegui runnerup with 
215 percent 
the democratic front is the centerright coalition backing 
novelist mario vargas llosa in aprils presidential elections and 
it was challenged in most of the municipal races by the united 
left a marxistled alliance 
sundays voting was seen first as a trial of whether the 
government could put on an election amid a rising tide of rebel 
violence 
it was also considered a bellwether of the appeal of vargas 
llosa the presidential frontrunner as well as a gauge of just 
how unpopular garcias centerleft aprista party has become 
vargas llosa called the vote very important to the future of 
our country to demonstrate that peruvians do not fear the 
extremist minorities that want to destroy our democracy 
more than 130 mayors local judges clerks council members and 
municipal candidates have been slain by the rebels so far this 
year and hundreds more have resigned out of fear 
vargas llosa sought to play down inchausteguis defeat in the 
capital saying belmonts victory signaled a desire for change 
that is being profoundly felt from one end of the country to the 
other 
with peru suffering from 3000 percent annual inflation and 
economic chaos aprista candidates had been given little chance of 
winning many mayoral races 
vargas llosa entered the political fray after garcia tried in 
1987 to nationalize all the countrys financial institutions a 
move that seriously cost the once popular president 
a television exit poll sunday showed vargas llosa would capture 
55 percent of the vote if presidential elections were held 
immediately no other candidate got more than 14 percent support in 
the poll 
the novelist applauded the victories of democratic front 
candidates in towns and provinces torn by guerrilla violence 
unofficial returns from outside the capital where nearly a 
third of the impoverished nations 21 million people live showed a 
clear repudiation of aprista candidates of the democratic front 
appeared to take most of the seats 
about 10 million peruvians were registered to vote peru has 
1947 municipalities but election authorities said there were no 
candidates in at least 86 towns due to rebel death threats 
election officials in huancayo 140 miles east of lima counted 
ballots by candlelight sunday night after guerrillas blew up power 
pylons causing a blackout police reports from the city said 
rebels set off a series of dynamite charges in the city shortly 
after the blackout began 
reporters said gunfire could be heard throughout the city which 
has been under a nighttime curfew since friday 
early sunday the rebels dynamited a church and a school in the 
city 
the attacks followed more than 20 explosions around the city 
saturday night intended to disrupt the voting as the first stage in 
their campaign to block the presidential election 
police said a young man and young woman were electrocuted by 
falling power lines sunday when a power pylon was blown up 12 miles 
north of huancayo 
they also said four people were killed and three wounded when 
one of the victims stepped on a mine a few miles north of huancayo 
as they were returning home from voting the mine was presumably 
set by the rebels 
authorities said shining path guerrillas shot and killed the 
aprista mayoral candidate early sunday in azangaro near the 
bolivian border 470 miles southeast of lima

top administration officials say the kremlin 
is continuing to deploy new strategic nuclear weapons although a 
published report said some deployments had been cut in anticipation 
of an arms control deal 
the fact of the matter is the soviets have continued to 
modernize their strategic forces defense secretary dick cheney 
said on the nbctv program meet the press on sunday 
cheney did not flatly deny a washington post report quoting 
unidentified government sources as saying the soviets had stopped 
producing four new weapons the ss18 and ss24 missile the 
blackjack bomber and the typhoon submarine and had suspended work 
on an aircraft carrier 
the post said the reports apparently based on satellite 
photography conflicted with recent statements by cheney and vice 
president dan quayle that the soviets continued to deploy new 
weapons 
responding to that assertion cheney said the soviets might have 
slowed deployments of some new systems in order not to exceed a 
ceiling proposed for the strategic arms reduction treaty which 
would slash longrange superpower nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 
50 percent 
that treaty is not expected to be the centerpiece of a summit 
planned for dec 23 in the mediterranean sea senior us 
officials have said the start deal might be ready for another 
meeting between president bush and mikhail s gorbachev slated for 
next spring or summer

could an american do in tokyo what mitsubishi did 
with a stroke of its pen in new york gain controlling interest in 
the landmark rockefeller center 
the answer is sure well maybe but if 
for one thing not much real estate is available in central 
tokyo to buy and whats available is far more expensive than 
similar real estate in the united states 
if the building were worth having nobody would sell it 
says james doherty a real estate analyst at jardine fleming 
securities 
vacancy rates in central tokyo are below 05 percent and land 
prices are as high as 353 million yen per square meter 22940 a 
square foot or 992 million an acre 
the mitsubishi estate co of japan paid 846 million for a 51 
percent share of the rockefeller group which owns the 22acre 
rockefeller center in the prime midtown area of manhattan 
if rockefeller center were in central tokyo its 22 acres would 
be worth about 217 billion at going japanese real estate prices 
and 51 percent of that comes to about 11 billion 
mitsubishi paid the 846 million not for the land but for the 
majority share in the rockefeller group 
thats how the japanese are accustomed to operating said 
doherty and its how an american or another foreigner probably 
would have to operate in tokyo to make a deal like mitsubishi did 
in new york 
its easier to buy companies than to buy land doherty said 
but tokyo which was razed by an earthquake in 1923 and by 
allied bombing in world war ii doesnt have prestigious landmarks 
like rockefeller center 
there just arent many buildings with much status says 
noriko hama a researcher at the mitsubishi research institute 
people might be shocked if a foreigner bought the kasumigaseki 
building japans first skyscraper but it wouldnt be for sale 
anyway she said 
lawyers and analysts active in mergers and acquisitions in japan 
say it isnt government regulations as many foreigners believe 
that prevent foreigners from buying japanese real estate or 
companies but the realities of the marketplace plus the ageold 
insularity of the japanese as well as those things foreign eyes 
dont see and foreign ears dont hear 
among the realities of the marketplace are high stock prices and 
a system of sharecrossholdings that locks about 70 percent of all 
stocks in the hands of stable shareholders who often are corporate 
allies in addition not many shares are in circulation 
so far foreign corporate buyouts of listed companies in japan 
number exactly one the recent acquisition of sansui electric co 
by the british conglomerate polly peck international plc 
the tendency in japans corporate world to do business only with 
trusted allies has traditionally limited both domestic and foreign 
participation in mergers and acquisitions 
such deals says lawyer kanji ishizumi in his 1988 book 
acquiring japanese companies have customarily been arranged as 
rescues by associated firms or banks of companies in trouble 
selling to an outsider especially for speculative purposes 
ishizumi says is as much a betrayal as a captain of a ship 
deserting his crew in a storm 
ishizumi recommends that foreign buyers cultivate informal ties 
with businessmen and even government officials before attempting 
any takeover activity to avoid a backlash 
without that type of nemawashi or groundwork investors 
face the same rejection that texas oilman t boone pickens has run 
into in his battles to win a seat on the board of koito 
manufacturing even though he holds a 26 percent stake in the 
company toyota motor co with a 19 percent share has three seats 
it is necessary to build a trusting relationship first said 
tamotsu aoyama a koito director in japan it is not possible to 
just say im a major shareholder and get a seat on the board 
right away 
but foreign investment is growing here nevertheless mergers 
and acquisitions experts predict a boom as foreign pressure against 
exclusionary business practices makes it increasingly difficult for 
japanese corporations to shut out foreign competitors 
in the fiscal year that ended march 31 foreign investments in 
japan were up 465 percent over the previous year to 324 billion 
according to the finance ministry 
it says investment by us firms took 547 percent of the total 
jumping 891 percent over the previous year to 177 billion the 
united states meanwhile attracted 217 billion in direct 
investment from japan up 476 percent from fiscal 1987 
federal express merck pharmaceuticals motorola bayer and 
general electric co are among many foreign companies that have 
made small inroads 
pickens stake in koito and polly pecks takeover of the ailing 
sansui electric co indicate traditional barriers to foreigners are 
crumbling says howard chao an attorney with the tokyo office of 
omelveny and myers 
foreign acquisitions are heating up in japan chao added 
there are indications it will open up more and more 
likely targets for foreign takeovers analysts say are 
companies in straits similar to sansui once one of japans top 
three audio equipment makers sansui has not paid a dividend for 
five years and faced the threat of no longer being listed on the 
stock exchange if not rescued from its debt by march 
polly pecks 1088 million 51 percent stake in sansui gained 
the british company entry into japans competitive electronics 
market 
in another deal two regional supermarket chains chujitsuya co 
and inageya co turned to the usbacked firm of nomura 
wasserstein perella co to underwrite a share issue and help fend 
off a takeover bid by property giant shuwa corp said doherty 
it wouldnt be difficult to imagine an assetheavy company 
worn down by takeover attempts being grateful for a foreign white 
knight to come along although one would have to be seen very 
clearly as a savior from a fate worse than death he said the 
market is moving toward this 
pickens bought many of his shares in koito manufacturing from 
the tokyobased azabu group a group of companies affiliated with 
azabu motors co that is wellknown for arbitrage activities 
acquisitions of japanese companies are almost never tender 
offers they are usually furtive creeping accumulations of stock 
holdings by such groups said chao

the government is suing the owners of a greek 
freighter that ran aground on a fragile coral reef in the florida 
keys blaming negligence for the third such grounding in less than 
three weeks 
the us attorneys office filed the lawsuit sunday with a 
federal magistrate 
today a coast guard board of inquiry was scheduled to begin 
taking testimony from officers and crew said justice department 
spokeswoman diane cossin 
federal agents already have seized the 470foot freighter mv 
elpis which smashed living corals when it grounded friday night on 
elbow reef in the key largo national marine sanctuary 
at this point were alleging negligence on behalf of those in 
charge of the vessel ms cossin said the us district court 
suit will demand payment of recovery costs and compensation for 
damage to the ocean ecosystem but the amount hasnt been decided 
ms cossin said 
a similar suit in one of the earlier groundings seeks 9 million 
in damages 
the elpis ran aground as its crew deliberately steered close to 
the reef away from the northward currents of the gulf stream to 
save time and fuel said michael white manager of the key largo 
national marine sanctuary 
they were a little bit confused by the navigation lights 
said sanctuary officer jayson horadam they knew something was 
wrong but as they were rechecking their position they went 
aground 
the ship carrying sugar and fuel oil floated free at high tide 
saturday there were no reports of fuel leaking 
federal agents boarded the vessel and moved it to an anchorage 
off miami beach ms cossin said 
the grounding did serious damage said billy causey a federal 
marine biologist who inspected the site sunday to help prepare 
estimates for the lawsuit 
some of the major framework of the reef has been fractured and 
damaged considerably causey said 
horadam said he spoke with the crew seven hours after the 
accident and they were cooperative 
at first they werent comprehending what the big todo was 
about he said we explained to them it was like somebody 
destroying the acropolis and that totally got their attention 
the elpis grounded about 4 miles south of the spot where the 
155foot freighter alec owen maitland ran aground oct 25 cutting 
a 200foot swath through the sanctuarys reef 
five days later the 475foot cargo ship mavro vetranic got 
stuck on a reef off the dry tortugas in the far western keys the 
government is seeking 9 million in damages for the destruction of 
a 500foot strip of coral 
the sanctuary is designed to preserve parts of the worlds third 
largest living reef which extends about 200 miles from miami to 
the dry tortugas

the return of colder temperatures helped ease the flood threat 
in the pacific northwest but it was more like summer again today 
in the south central and southeastern united states 
warm weather that melted mountain snow combined with days of 
heavy rain had led to flooding that caused millions of dollars in 
damage in washington state but even though more rain was predicted 
today colder temperatures were expected to prevent further 
snowmelt in the mountains 
high mountain passes in washington got up to four inches of snow 
sunday night while browning mont got 11 inches of snow 
northwestern montana also had some flooding during the weekend from 
storms that dropped up to five inches of rain in some areas 
farther south 30 cities had record high temperatures sunday as

chancellor helmut kohl tried today to 
allay concerns that events in east gemany could affect the future 
of west german commitments to poland 
kohl continued a grueling program traveling by bus in dense fog 
to the southeastern city of lublin where he was awarded an 
honorary doctorate by the prestigious catholic university 
in his address kohl assured his polish hosts that we wish to 
support these polish reforms from the outside through a 
prospective form of cooperation we are ready for such 
dialogue 
west germany has already pledged about 15 billion in aid but 
finance minister leszek balcerowicz has said that is still not 
enough and does not correspond to west germanys ability to help 
the chancellor was to meet with lawmakers in warsaw this 
afternoon 
kohl held unusually intense and open talks with communist 
president wojciech jaruzelski and solidarity prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki on sunday night said hans klein the chancellors 
spokesman 
he told reporters the talks centered on the dramatic 
developments in east germany and the reform movement in poland 
the talks in warsaw took place after kohl and mazowiecki 
attended mass in a former german village where members of the nazi 
resistance met during the war 
the two men embraced in a sign of reconciliation before a crowd 
of about 5000 worshippers many of whom are ethnic germans who 
decided to remain in their native region of silesia 
after the war large parts of east prussia and silesia were 
awarded to poland and the border issue remains extremely sensitive 
for both countries 
west germany pledged to respect the oder and neisse rivers as 
polands western border in a 1970 warsaw treaty but a reunified 
germany might not be committed to those terms 
west german conservatives recently have suggested seeking 
reunification within the 1937 borders which include about 
onethird of presentday poland 
kohl alluded to the pain of those germans expelled as a result 
of the postwar settlement in a speech in warsaw on thursday poland 
also lost large areas of territory which were incorporated into 
the soviet union 
polish television on sunday broadcast two panel discussions 
devoted to the explosion of events in east germany and the 
consequences for poland of germany reunification 
some of the participants welcomed the dismantling of the berlin 
wall saying it brought poland as well as east germany closer to 
western europe 
but any tampering with the postwar order that would alter affect 
polish security was out of the question 
i would like to hear a clear assurance that our western border 
is untouchable said jacek maziarski a journalist at tygodnik 
solidarnosc the weekly edited by mazowiecki until he became prime 
minister on aug 24 
i want to believe germans will also understand there is more 
sense in business than in initiation of new fights maziarski 
said 
klein said kohl had raised the issue of a concentration of 
assistance for east germany but the spokesman appeared to indicate 
that would not jeopardize help for poland 
the two countries signed agreements that pledge 15 billion in 
aid for poland before kohl interrupted his visit friday for one day 
to attend an emergency cabinet meeting in bonn on the east german 
situation 
the solidarityled government said aid is needed for the country 
to make the transition to a market economy and secure democratic 
reforms now under way

he has two families two identities and 
two homelands hes also an exconvict charged with the murder of 
an interior decorator last thanksgiving eve 
james hudson savage or russell thomas moore 26 is from 
australias bush country he was taken from his teenage mother 
shortly after birth and adopted by a missionary couple who brought 
him to the united states 
prosecutors allege that he robbed raped and strangled barbara 
ann barber outside her melbourne fla shop nov 23 just 33 days 
after his release from floridas maximumsecurity state prison and 
11 years after the first of his many brushes with the law 
savagemoores trial on charges of firstdegree murder sexual 
battery and robbery was scheduled to begin today in circuit court 
in rockledge jury selection was expected to take about two days 
and opening arguments were expected to begin wednesday 
prosecutors are seeking the death penalty while a defense 
attorney his biological mother and his adoptive parents all want 
him returned to australia regardless of the trials outcome 
beverley moore whyman the defendants mother contends her son 
was illegally taken from her 26 years ago under an australian 
program that allowed aborigine children to be removed from their 
families and tribal homelands for adoption by whites 
that government policy which continued until the late 1960s 
resulted in a high rate of mortality suicide unemployment 
truancy alcoholism welfaredependency and crime aboriginal 
activists contend 
the baby called russell thomas moore was adopted by a white 
missionary couple graeme and nesta savage in 1963 when he was 4 
months old his name was changed to james hudson savage and at the 
age of 7 he accompanied his adoptive parents when they came to 
melbourne fla 
in his teens james hudson savage turned to crime and became a 
heavy user of drugs and alcohol and had explosions of violence and 
sexually deviant behavior according to police records 
he served four prison sentences for car theft burglary and 
violent behavior in prison including trying to kill a fellow 
inmate and a guard 
he tried to commit suicide and was committed to a psychiatric 
facility at florida state prison but he was freed under the 
states earlyrelease program 
a little over a month later he was charged with raping and 
strangling the interior designer in an alleyway outside her 
showroom 
the savages said they were unable to find him in 1983 when they 
moved back to australia to continue their missionary work his 
biological mother heard nothing of him after he was taken from her 
for adoption until after he was charged with murder 
money was raised by aboriginal activists in australia so she 
could come here and be reunited with her son she and others have 
been trying to persuade authorities to send him back to australia 
even if he is convicted so he wont have to face the death penalty 
savages lawyer george turner has refused comment on that 
aspect of the case 
before the trial turner won approval from circuit judge 
lawrence johnston to refer to his client as russell thomas moore 
rather than savage because his last name might cause the jury to 
think of him as an uncivilized primitive 
the judge ruled he would allow prosecutors to refer to him as 
mr savage 
we are not going to mock his name asserted assistant state 
attorney russ bausch at a hearing on the issue last week

the dollar inched up against most major foreign 
currencies in early european trading today gold prices rose as 
much as 540 an ounce 
currency dealers said the dollar was fluctuating in a narrow 
range in quiet trading and that attention had shifted to cross 
rate trading 
they said the market was still trying to digest the sweeping 
reforms in east germany but said most traders expect the rapid 
changes in relationships between the two germanies to have a 
positive impact on the west german mark 
the german thing is throwing everything else into the shadows 
right now said a trader at a west german bank in frankfurt 
a lot of people abroad were assuming this would somehow be bad 
for the west german economy and knocked the mark lower friday 
theyre apparently skeptical about the changes 
i think when all is said and done people will see this as a 
positive rather than a negative factor for the mark she said 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day 
begins the dollar rose 080 yen to a closing 14355 yen later in 
london it was quoted at 14368 yen 
other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late friday

leading soviet economists today began discussing a 
plan to increase wages and wholesale prices beginning next year 
and sell off some staterun enterprises to end an economic crisis 
and build a market system 
emphasizing the seriousness of the undertaking soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev premier nikolai i ryzhkov and other members 
of the communist party politburo attended the session at moscows 
white marble hall of columns in the house of unions but they did 
not speak during the threeday conferences first session 
we cannot wait for reform economist leonid i abalkin 
chosen to head the push for economic reform said in his keynote 
speech the value of time has grown enormously 
the situation is dangerous the threat is grave added a 
second economist stanislav s shatalin 
the plan published last month in the economicheskaya gazeta 
newspaper offered a detailed analysis of an economy plagued by 
shortages hoarding a nearworthless currency topheavy 
bureaucracy and an increasing number of strikes 
in contrast to much of the public debate over the economy it 
provided a plan to free up prices jettison staterun enterprises 
that are losing money and aim toward convertibility of the ruble 
by the mid1990s 
the plan was a response to gorbachevs demand that economists 
stop their public bickering and formulate a plan of action 
ed hewett an american expert on the soviet economy told 
reporters watching a live broadcast of the session at the foreign 
ministry press center that if implemented there is a decent 
chance the plan will work 
but after more than four years of attempted reform that only 
have worsened the economy the public must be convinced and the 
government must chop away at the budget deficit and pentup 
consumer demand in the next year hewett said 
the next year is when were going to find out if theyre 
really going to do it he said abalkins thrown down the 
gauntlet 
abalkin deputy chairman of the council of ministers or 
cabinet told the conference of academics and economic managers 
they must overcome public disillusion 
in a poll conducted in conjunction with the economic proposal 
54 percent of those questioned said their first priority was 
introduction of strict discipline and order and 40 percent 
said they wanted the government to tighten not loosen price 
controls he said 
in response to another question 22 percent said the problems of 
the soviet economy are inherent in socialism abalkin said 
abalkins plan calls for wage increases beginning next year 
freefloating prices and healthy competition regulated by 
antimonopoly laws 
the plan proposes a timetable for conversion of the staterun 
economy to a mixture of stateheld industries publicly owned 
enterprises and private cooperatives 
the blueprint foresees the sale of shares in industrial 
enterprises establishment of a stock market competitive bidding 
for state contracts and legislative oversight to prevent abuses of 
the new system 
it also proposes temporary unemployment benefits for those who 
must be retrained when their jobs are eliminated 
sooner or later we are going to have to take the bitter 
medicine of raising prices said the report published in 
ekonomicheskaya gazetta without that it concludes there is no 
way to eliminate widespread shortages of food and consumer goods 
combat rampant speculation and the shadow economy in which 
scarse goods are being siphoned from legitimate channels and sold 
or traded under the table or on the black market 
gorbachev and other soviet leaders have been talking about the 
need for price reform for more than two years but lifting of state 
price controls has been put off indefinitely in the face of popular 
anxiety and instances of runaway inflation in yugoslavia and 
poland both of which have tried to establish more realistic 
pricing systems

statement from the hospital director said dr juan beltran said 
mrs ibarruri died of pneumonia with respiratory difficulties 
at her bedside was her sole surviving child her daughter amaya 
and other relatives 
mrs ibarruri began a career as a labor organizer and strike 
leader and wrote articles she signed as la pasionaria a name 
she chose in 1916 because her first article appeared during holy 
week known in spanish as the week of the passion 
during the 1936 siege of madrid by rebel forces led by gen 
francisco franco mrs ibarruris defiant phrase they shall not 
pass became the rallying cry of the loyalist republican army 
her speeches made her an antifascist heroine to millions during 
the 193639 war 
many literary scholars believe she was the model for pilar the 
heroine of ernest hemingways novel of the war for whom the bell 
tolls 
the daughter and granddaughter of northern basque coal miners 
mrs ibarruri was a founding member of the spanish communist party 
at the time of her death she was the partys honorary president 
after francos nationalists won the war in 1939 she fled to the 
soviet union and lived there for 38 years 
she returned to madrid in 1977 two years after francos death 
as spain underwent a peaceful transition to democracy 
that same year she won back her deputys seat first occupied in 
1936 in the lower house of parliament she later gave it up because 
of her age and delicate health 
the spanish communist party which named her honorary president 
in 1960 said in a statement in informing with sorrow of her 
death the spanish communists address the communist socialist 
progressive forces and the democratic movement of all the world 
expressing our will of contributing with a daily effort to the 
ideals of emancipation and peace which stimulated the life of 
dolores ibarruri 
on dec 9 1985 figures from the international communist 
movement and from spains socialist government feted la pasionaria 
on her 90th birthday 
the name of la pasionaria sums up an entire era in the 
struggle of workers and the spanish people for freedom democracy 
and progress cuban president fidel castro wrote in an article 
published for the celebration 
born in the basque village of gallarta on dec 9 1895 mrs 
ibarruri was the eighth of 11 children she said the harsh 
conditions of her youth turned her into a revolutionary i knew 
the terrible pain of days without bread and winters without fire 
she wrote in her autobiography my way 
her family was too poor to pay for schooling so she abandoned 
her ambition of becoming a teacher she married julian ruiz a 
socialist activist five years her senior 
ruiz once recalled her as being as independent as a mountain 
goat 
separated from his wife since the 1930s ruiz died a few weeks 
after her return to spain from moscow 
dolores ibarruri turned to politics after ruiz introduced her to 
socialism and marxism she read about the russian revolution two 
names she wrote later struck me in my heart and in my head 
russia and lenin i no longer felt sad i no longer felt alone 
in 1934 she led a rebellion by 40000 miners in the northern 
province of asturias 
when the civil war broke out in july 1936 she led rallies 
visited republican forces and made ringing radio broadcasts 
she nearly always wore black once when asked why she 
responded a woman of humble background like me cant wear bright 
clothes with a black dress although it may be inexpensive one 
can go anywhere and one goes more decently 
shortly after her return from exile she underwent an operation 
to have a pacemaker installed she had suffered sporadic health 
problems since 
she first entered the hospital sept 13 but one month later 
returned to her madrid home after undergoing treatment for 
pneumonia 
mrs ibarruri entered the hospital nov 8 in serious condition

lebanons new christian president today 
named moslem leader salim hoss as premier entrusting him with the 
task of forming a united national government to end the countrys 
civil war 
staccato bursts of gunfire interspersed with shell blasts 
resounded across the capital as the president spoke 
police said syrianbacked moslem militiamen were fighting 
christian army units across beiruts sectarian green line there 
was no immediate report of casualties 
hoss appointment puts him in a direct confrontation with 
christian army commander gen michel aoun who heads a threeman 
interim military cabinet that competed with hoss syrianbacked 
moslem government aoun governs the christian enclave north and 
northeast of beirut 
president rene mouawad a maronite made todays announcement at 
his temporary office in moslem west beirut after three days of 
consultations with parliament leaders 
hoss 59 a sunni moslem bankerturnedpolitician accepted his 
fourth premiership in 13 years pledging to carry out an 
arabbrokered peace accord that provides for equal power between 
moslems and christians 
after his announcement today mouawad flanked by hoss and 
parliament speaker hussein husseini received in audience all 
ambassadors to lebanon 
i call upon all of you to join our march toward peace 
mouawad said in brief remarks we consider the taif accord an 
introduction to peace and a launching pad for a new republic 
i pledge to whole world to consolidate the unity and 
sovereignty of lebanon and to rebuild its constitutional 
institutions 
mouawad urged the international community to pressure israel 
into evacuating a border enclave it occupied in south lebanon in 
1985 to serve as a buffer against crossborder guerrilla raids 
he made no mention of the 40000 syrian troops who control 70 
percent of lebanon 
the meeting underscored the widespread international recognition 
of mouawads election and aouns diplomatic isolation 
there was no us diplomat at todays meeting the united states 
closed its lebanon embassy sept 6 after aouns supporters 
surrounded it during a protest 
the peace accord increasing the influence of the moslems was 
approved by the lebanese parliament on oct 22 after a 23day 
special session in saudi arabias summer resort of taif under the 
auspices of an arab league committee 
nine days ago parliament moved to advance the pact by electing 
mouawad 64 for the presidency that had been vacant for 409 days 
aoun 54 a maronite who declared a war of liberation in 
march to drive the syrian army out of lebanon has rejected 
mouawads election as unconstitutional calling him a syrian 
lackey 
aoun insisting that his cabinet was the countrys sole 
legitimate authority has vowed to prevent mouawad and his future 
government from entering the christian enclave 
he was appointed to head the interim cabinet by president amin 
gemayel on sept 22 1988 when his 6year term expired with 
parliament unable to elect a successor because of religious 
differences 
moslems rejected aouns appointment contending it violated a 
1943 unwritten national covenant that assigned the premiership to 
the sunnis the presidency to the maronites and parliament 
speakership to the shiite moslems 
they pledged allegiance to hoss who then was head of the 
syrianbacked cabinet that broke from gemayel hoss tendered the 
resignation of that cabinet to mouawad when he was elected 
president 
hoss commands wide respect among christians and moslems alike 
because he has adamantly refused to take sides throughout the 
14yearold civil war 
meanwhile the syrianbacked amal militia clashed with the 
proiranian hezbollah in east lebanons bekaa valley overnight 
police said today 
two amal fighters were wounded a police spokesman said 
he said the fighting between the rival shiite militias in the 
western bekaa village of sohmor also destroyed amals headquarters 
in the village the village had been under joint control 
hezbollah intermittently fought fierce battles with amal for 
dominance of lebanons shiites from april 1988 until january this 
year at least 500 people were killed and 1500 wounded in the 
ninemonth confrontation that ended with syrian and iranian 
mediation

reports of a rare blood disease spread 
after the government warned consumers to temporarily stop taking 
ltryptophan a dietary supplement suspected of causing the 
outbreak 
investigators from the food and drug administration on sunday 
finished interviewing people with the disorder and collecting 
samples of ltryptophan from stores in new mexico which has the 
greatest number of cases said nancy hunter spokeswoman for the 
states health and environment department 
the team will test for contamination of the nonprescription 
remedy touted as natures sleeping pill and sold in health food 
stores to treat sleeplessness and premenstrual syndrome 
the number of reported cases of the potentially fatal disorder 
eosinophilia climbed to 55 over the weekend as california virginia 
and minnesota joined six other states already reporting the 
syndrome said dr edwin kilbourne of the us centers for disease 
control there were 21 in new mexico four in oregon three in 
texas and one each from arizona missouri and mississippi 
at least 11 patients with eosinophilia have been hospitalized 
including nine in new mexico 
the increase in cases prompted the us food and drug 
administration to warn consumers to emporarily discontinue use of 
ltryptophan an amino acid 
the fda said a joint investigation with the cdc had yet to 
determine a causeandeffect association with the blood condition 
but affected persons in most of the cases have reported taking 
ltryptophan products before becoming ill 
symptoms of the disorder include sharp muscular pain fatigue 
fever and rashes the syndrome usually is associated with bronchial 
asthma allergies parasitic infections or reactions to medicine 
it is called eosinophilia because it is characterized by high 
counts of a type of white blood cells called eosinophils 
new mexico health officials asked retailers to stop selling 
ltryptophan while the investigation is under way 
makers of ltryptophan said they dont believe their product is 
to blame for the outbreak although they said small disreputable 
companies may have produced contaminated batches 
annette dickinson technical counselor of the council for 
responsible nutrition a washingtonbased trade association of food 
supplement manufacturers said most ltryptophan is processed by 
large manufacturers many of them are pharmaceutical companies that 
adhere to druglevel quality control she said 
she said it is possible small disreputable companies might be 
producing contaminated ltryptophan but i wouldnt expect their 
distribution to be very widespread 
sixteen people died nationwide in 1986 as a result of 
hypereosinophilic syndrome a form of eosinophilia and 12 died in 
1987 said sandy smith of the national center for health statistics

the communist party central committee has 
formally ousted former party chief zhao ziyang from its ranks 
sources said today nearly six months after he was accused of 
supporting the studentled democracy movement 
the nov 69 plenary session of the committee voted that zhao 
who was ousted from office in june would be removed from all his 
duties in the committee according to sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the central committee meeting for the first time since the june 
session during which zhao was purged did not mention zhao in its 
final communique leaving open the question of how the party would 
handle his case 
some party hardliners reportedly hoped to put zhao on trial on 
charges of fomenting counterrevolutionary rebellion but others 
including senior leader deng xiaoping are believed to have 
resisted 
it was unclear whether zhao had been stripped of his party 
membership as well or would be allowed to remain a member of the 
47millionmember party he once headed 
zhao 70 one of the architects and main proponents of the 
marketoriented reforms that have brought prosperity to millions of

the leader of the sinhalese group that 
has been waging an antigovernment campaign of terror was shot to 
death by government forces today while in custody the foreign 
minister said today 
rohana wijeweera head of the peoples liberation front was 
arrested sunday afternoon in the central hill district the 
official ranjan wijeratne told a news conference 
wijeweera subsequently agreed to lead government security men to 
one of the fronts offices in a colombo suburb wijeratne said 
once in the office wijeweera instructed front politburo member 
hb herath to hand over some documents he added 
herath pretended to do so but instead pulled a gun and fired at 
wijeweera and then government forces opened fire killing both 
wijeweera and herath the minister said 
president ranasinghe premadasa has ordered an investigation into 
the shooting wijeratne who is also deputy defense minister said 
security forces had already cremated the bodies of wijeweera and 
herath under emergency regulations that allow them to dispose of 
bodies without further inquiry 
the circumstances of wijeweeras death if uncorroborated 
seemed likely to prompt charges he was murdered by security forces 
such charges could aggravate the violence in the sinhalese 
heartland 
wijeweeras organization accuses the sinhalesedominated 
government of selling out the countrys sinhalese majority in an 
effort to make peace with ethnic tamil guerrillas 
more than 6000 people have been killed in the past two years in 
the struggle between the government and the peoples liberation 
front 
wijeratne reading a statement from army commander hamilton 
wanasinghe said wijeweera was detained with his wife and five 
children sunday afternoon in ulapane village near kandy 55 miles 
northeast of colombo 
according to this account the soldiers suspected wijeweeras 
true identity even though he had shaved his beard trimmed his 
hair gained weight and looked younger than his age wijeweera who 
was born in 1943 acknowledged his identity and was taken to 
colombo the statement said 
wijeweera who once studied in the soviet union founded the 
peoples liberation front the group has marxist roots 
the government has blamed the front for most of the killings in 
the groups campaign of terror however human rights activists and 
opposition politicians say many were revenge killings by government 
forces or progovernment vigilantes 
the peoples liberation front denounced the sri lankan 
government for signing an indianbrokered peace accord in 1987 in 
an effort to end the revolt by tamil separatists in northeastern 
sri lanka 
the front said the accord promised too many concessions to the 
tamils and it vowed to kill anyone who supported the pact 
in addition to the 6000 people killed in the sinhalese 
violence more than 11000 people have died in the predominantly 
tamil northeast since the separatist revolt by tamil militants 
began in 1983

communist party leader milos jakes 
urged changes within the party to bring in younger members more 
likely to initiate change official media reports said today 
but the hardline leader said the government would not tolerate 
street protests nor engage in dialogue with groups advocating that 
czechoslovakia abandon communism 
jakes spoke sunday to a conference of official communist youth 
where speakers were unusually critical of the regime accusing 
leaders of losing the trust of czechoslovakias young people 
we must introduce the new generation in the process of 
change jakes told about 9oo delegates to the conference 
sponsored by the socialist youth union the sole official 
representative of young people in czechoslovakia 
the twoday session which ended here sunday came at a time of 
breathtaking reforms in neighboring east bloc countries and amid 
increasing calls for changes in the czechoslovak leadership 
the cadre policy will probably constantly be subject to great 
changes because the older generation is leaving the 
official ctk news agency quoted jakes as saying 
most of the countrys leaders were installed after the 
sovietled invasion that crushed the prague spring reforms of 
alexander dubcek in 1968 they have been reluctant to implement the 
kind of politicl changes sweeping the soviet bloc from moscow to 
berlin 
czechoslovakia which enjoys one of the highest standards of 
living of the seven warsaw pact nations has taken one of the 
hardest lines against dissent 
batonwielding police in prague last month dispersed up to 
10000 demonstrators who called for freedom and a new government 
highlighting major differences among the eastbloc allies on free 
expression and reform 
jakes indicated this tough line would not change saying a 
dialogue cannot be conducted through such street demonstrations 
whose aim is to provoke violate pubic order and to strive 
in fact for abandoning communism ctk reported 
pressure on jakes 67 and president gustav husak 76 is 
believed to be growing analysts said husak served as communist 
party leader after the warsaw pact invasion until december 1987 
when jakes replaced him 
communist youth leader vasil mohorita criticized the leadership 
and said the governments course of restructuring which 
foresees some economic changes but few political reforms does not 
fit the expectations of young people ctk reported 
some youths are losing faith in the possibility for communist 
renewal mohorita said 
the reason for the weakening of trust is that an atmosphere of 
selfsatisfaction has ruled in this country he said adding that 
the party had covered up mistakes and refused to accept criticism 
jakes said a restructuring of the party apparatus had already 
begun and pledged that it would continue

women who are carriers of genetic diseases may be 
able to avoid bearing defective fetuses through a newly developed 
technique for screening human eggs before fertilization chicago 
researchers say 
under the process developed at the reproductive genetics 
institute of illinois masonic medical center doctors remove eggs 
from the womans body as they would in any testtube pregnancy 
the eggs are inspected for mutations then healthy eggs are 
fertilized in a petri dish with sperm and returned to the womans 
womb 
the technique was discovered by embryologist yury verlinsky 
director of the cell genetics laboratory who said he was able to 
spot mutations in human ova ready for in vitro fertilization 
in the future verlinsky said it could become routine for 
those disorders for which there is a welldefined gene because it 
decreases risk to an embryo 
a report on the technique was to be presented today at the 
annual meeting of the american society of human genetics in 
baltimore 
this procedure is for couples who already know theyre 
carriers of genetic diseases but wont consider an abortion said 
dr charles strom chief of medical genetics at the center these 
people already may have lost a child or have an aversion to 
abortion or the psychological trauma that can go along with it 
current genetic tests are conducted after pregnancy and hold 
some risk to the developing fetus

the supreme court today allowed states to ban 
doortodoor and telephone solicitation for prearranged funerals 
and burial 
the court without comment left intact a west virginia law 
challenged by a funeral service company as an infringement of 
freespeech rights 
the west virginia legislature in a 1983 law enacted extensive 
new regulations of the funeral service industry 
the law barred companies from making unsolicited sales pitches 
either doortodoor or over the phone to potential customers 
national funeral services inc sells prearranged or preneed 
funeral and burial services the company is a west virginia 
subsidiary of legacy one inc which owns funeral homes and 
cemeteries througout the southeast and midwest 
the company said it seeks to promote competition in the industry 
by offering its services before they are needed 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals last march said west 
virginias ban on doortodoor and telemarketing sales does not 
violate the freespeech protections of the constitutions first 
amendment 
the state has a legitimate interest in the protection of 
consumers from overreaching and highpressure sales tactics of this 
most unique product the 4th circuit court said west 
virginias ban on solicitation is supported by the substantial 
interest of protecting privacy 
the appeals court said the freespeech restrictions are minimal 
noting that the state permits directmail and newspaper 
advertisements for funeral services 
the supreme court on oct 2 left intact a similar virginia law 
prohibiting telephone solicitation for prearranged funerals 
the case acted on today is national funeral services vs 
rockefeller 89639

the parting of the berlin wall has opened 
floodgates of fear in israel about a reunified germany 
newspaper editorials leading intellectuals and politicians all 
expressed ambivalent feelings welcoming the east germans new 
freedom but questioning the dangers that could be posed if the two 
germanys ever reunited 
happiness at the falling of the wall suspicion over 
reunification of germany read a banner headline in the 
masscirculation daily yediot ahronot 
in an interview on israel television late sunday night prime 
minister yitzhak shamir said he foresees wide changes that will 
certainly alter the map of the world very soon 
of course when we are speaking about germany there is 
something the jewish nation has to say added shamir whose 
family was killed in the nazi holocaust there are certain 
sensitivities and for us it is a most serious problem 
shamirs spokesman yossi ahimeir said today that israel 
like all the world is following with great interest what is 
taking place in the last few days in europe in general and germany 
in particular but we will wait and see what the outcome is and 
where it leads 
vice premier shimon peres who immigrated to israel from poland 
during the rise of nazi power in the 1930s raised questions about 
germanys future in a television interview sunday 
on the one hand what is happening there brings forth great 
hope on the other hand no one among us is free of the memories of 
the second world war peres said 
when we hear of a united germany we must ask what kind of a 
germany it will be a germany with an army without an army a 
demilitarized germany a undemilitarized germany 
yosef lapid writing in the conservative maariv daily said 
we see the wave of history flooding eastern europe and find 
ourselves divided between our human identity and our jewish 
destiny 
maariv warned its readers in an editorial sunday about the 
grave danger that the german nation will begin again to toy with 
the illusion that it is possible to try to destroy the world a 
third time in less than 100 years 
shlomo aronson a political scientist at the hebrew university 
of jerusalem said 45 percent of the 35 million jews in israel are 
holocaust inspired or influenced either because they are 
survivors of the holocaust or because their families were 
devastated when the nazis murdered 6 million jews during world war 
ii 
he said the older generation which tends to be more 
conservative is especially fearful that a reunified germany would 
be dangerous 
fear of a reunified germany is not limited to survivors of the 
holocaust said tamar shoshan a berlinborn clinical psychologist 
who works in jerusalem with survivors and their children 
the sensitivity to a large and strong germany is the same for 
all jews no one can escape the fact of what happened she said 
the israeli doubts were evident sunday at the dedication in 
jerusalem of a memorial to 200000 soviet jewish soldiers who died 
fighting germany in world war ii 
im against reunification said veteran adolbert fiksler 
62 whose parents brother and sister were murdered in nazi 
concentration camps it should be cut up into more pieces

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
making it easier to collect all federal taxes owed by bankrupt 
corporations 
at issue are government attempts to hold officials of bankrupt 
corporations personally responsible for paying the owed taxes 
the controversy stems from the two types of federal taxes owed 
by employers trust fund and nontrust fund taxes and 
the differing consequences of nonpayments 
trust fund taxes are those withheld from employees paychecks 
representing those employees personal income taxes unemployment 
insurance and social security taxes 
should an employer fail to pay any trust fund taxes the 
government can collect an equivalent sum directly from the 
officials who are responsible for collecting and paying them 
an employer also may fail to pay its ordinary corporate income 
taxes or other nontrust fund taxes those to be paid directly by 
the corporation and not withheld or collected from someone else 
the government generally cannot impose personal liability on 
corporate officials if a corporations nontrust fund taxes go 
unpaid 
a massachusetts corporation called energy resources co filed 
for bankruptcy reorganization in 1983 while owing about 1 million 
in federal taxes most of which were trust fund taxes 
as part of its courtapproved reorganization the taxes owed by 
energy resources were to be paid over four years in making the 
first payment the bankruptcy trustee told the internal revenue 
service to apply it to trustfund taxes owed 
but the irs refused contending the payment could be applied to 
the corporations tax debt as the government agency chose 
the same sequence of events occurred after a rhode island 
corporation called newport offshore filed for bankruptcy 
reorganization in 1985 
court documents did not indicate the business in which either 
corporation was engaged 
federal judges in both states ruled that the irs had to apply 
the tax payments as specified and those rulings were upheld last 
march 31 by the bostonbased 1st us circuit court of appeals 
the appeals court treated delinquenttax payments by bankrupt 
corporations as voluntary allowing the taxpayer to specify 
how the money should be applied 
government lawyers say the irs has the right to apply such 
payments as it wants because they are involuntary 
the appeals court acknowledged that having the trust fund taxes 
paid off first hurts the governments chances of collecting all the 
money owed 
if the reorganized corporation were to run out of money a few 
years from now and trust fund debts were still owed the government 
might collect them from responsible individuals the appeals 
court said but if all trust fund debts have been paid and if the 
only debts are for say ordinary corporate income taxes the 
government will be out of luck for there are no personal 
guarantors of payment of a corporations ordinary tax liabilities 
in the appeal acted on today government lawyers told the 
justices that if bankrupt corporations routinely are allowed to 
designate how tax payments are to be applied up to 34 million 
per year in tax revenue could be lost 
the case is us vs energy resources 89255

salim hoss a sunni moslem who has been a 
voice of moderaton through 14 years of civil war returns to the 
prime ministers office for the fourth time in 13 years to try to 
end the fighting 
the 59yearold economist designated by president rene mouawad 
on monday to form a new government is a firm backer of democracy 
a freewheeling economy and christianmoslem coexistence he is 
married to a christian 
formidable obstacles stand before hoss as he attempts to head a 
government slated to introduce political reforms giving the moslem 
majority an equal share of power with the dominant christian 
minority 
foremost is the defiant christian army commander gen michel 
aoun who insists that a threeman interim military cabinet he 
headed for the past 13 months is the sole legitimate authority in 
lebanon 
hoss main asset is the wide respect he commands among 
christians and moslems even the caustic aoun spared hoss in his 
tirades against local arab and foreign leaders 
he is a clean and honest man whom i respect aoun once said 
of hoss during the height of the generals war of liberation to 
drive syrias 40000 troops from lebanon 
hoss previous tenure in office began june 2 1987 a day after 
prime minister rashid karami was assassinated hoss was named 
acting prime minister by president amin gemayel 
hoss who served as education minister under karami for three 
years clashed with aoun when gemayel named the general head of an 
interim military cabinet on sept 22 1988 the day gemayels 
sixyear term expired and parliament was unable to agree on a 
successor 
moslems pledged allegiance to hoss who eventually tendered the 
resignation of his cabinet when mouawad was elected president nov 
5 
hoss was born dec 20 1929 to a middleclass sunni family in 
west beirut his father died while he was very young and the family 
sacrificed heavily to see him through his studies at the american 
university of beirut 
after graduating in 1952 with a degree in economics and business 
administration he worked for the americanowned transarabian 
pipeline co 
he then transferred to the beirut chamber of commerce in 1954 
where his future wife leila pharoan worked as his secretary 
in 1955 hoss left the chamber of commerce to teach at the 
american university and to continue his studies he received his 
masters in 1957 the same year he married 
christianmoslem marriages were very rare in lebanon at the 
time mrs hoss has been quoted as saying her parents strongly 
opposed the union but they gave in when salim and i convinced 
them nothing can break our marriage 
the tall balding bespectacled hoss does not smoke or drink and 
normally goes to bed early he prefers oriental food and likes to 
spend evenings listening to classical music 
the couple left for the united states in 1959 where hoss 
obtained a doctorate in economics and business administration from 
the the university of indiana at bloomington 
his only child daughter wadad 30 was born in the united 
states 
on his return to lebanon hoss taught business management at the 
american university of beirut and from 1964 to 1966 he worked in 
kuwait as financial adviser to the kuwait fund for arab economic 
development 
he returned to the university in 1966 but the following year 
his close friend elias sarkis became governor of lebanons first 
banking commission 
the banking system had been shaken by the crash of intra bank 
then lebanons largest and hoss and sarkis worked together to 
shore up the system 
with this accomplished by 1973 hoss was appointed chairman and 
general manager of lebanons semipublic development bank 
he remained at this post until sarkis who had been elected 
president named him prime minister in december 1976 19 months

the supreme court today allowed arizona to tax 
the river raft trips a salt lake city business runs through grand 
canyon national park in arizona 
the justices without comment turned away arguments that the 
tax is unconstitutional 
moki mac river expeditions in salt lake city operates river 
rafting adventures in several western states one such trip is on 
the colorado river through arizona moki mac pays the national park 
service a fee for use of the park areas 
arizona tax officials in 1983 told moki mac it must pay a 
transaction privilege tax for doing business in their state moki 
mac protested contending that the tax violated the constitutions 
ban on undue state interference with interestate commerce 
a state judge ruled that the tax is invalid because moki mac 
does not have enough business contacts with arizona 
the utah company rents a twoacre lot in arizona on which it 
maintains a storage building and a dwelling where moki mac 
employees stay between trips 
an arizona appeals court reversed the judges ruling and upheld 
the tax 
the state maintains the highways over which moki macs 
employees and customers must travel to and from the trip sites 
the state appeals court said moki mac enjoys police protection 
for its leased property and for its employees who seasonally reside 
in its leased dwellings 
under a 1977 supreme court decision a state tax imposed on 
interstate commerce is valid if it 
is applied to an activity with a substantial connection with 
the taxing state 
is fairly apportioned 
does not discriminate against interstate commerce 
is fairly related to the services provided by the state 
the arizona appeals court said the tax on moki mac passed all 
four tests rejecting among other things the companys allegations 
that the tax is not fairly apportioned 
noting that utah does not tax moki macs grand canyon rafting 
trips the appeals court said no apportionment is required now 
because multiple taxation has not been shown to exist 
if utah starts to tax the raft trips the appeals court said 
the two states will have to fairly apportion the tax on moki 
macs business activities 
the arizona supreme court refused to hear moki macs appeal last 
june 13 
the case is moki mac river expeditions vs arizona department of 
revenue 89405

an optometrist says he plans to appeal 
an administrative decision putting him on probation for having some 
women patients strip to the waist during eye exams 
the iowa board of optometry examiners last month placed gary 
fisher on three years probation and ordered him to stop asking 
patients to strip to the waist during examinations 
fisher said he was checking for scoliosis or curvature of the 
spine because he thought it was linked to some eye disorders 
the board said the evidence did not show there was any 
voyeuristic or any other kind of sexual motivation 
fishers lawyer john mcclintock of des moines said the boards 
decision will be appealed in polk county district court 
fisher said the board members succumbed to the contamination 
of the judicial process by political medicine and the 
sensationalistic media

the aflcio opened its biennial convention 
today savoring its role in the success of polands solidarity 
union and determined to end what may be the american labor 
movements worst decade on a positive note 
in his keynote address this morning lane kirkland president of 
the labor federation invoked the convention theme of solidarity in 
promising a rebound for labor in the 1990s 
solidarity has been our shield against the most primitive and 
the most sophisticated attacks by the agents of avarice and 
exploitation kirkland said sounding a more militant stance 
toward future organizing and bargaining 
we will not take no for a permanent answer he said and 
we will not pull away from any struggle 
kirkland also invoked the words of his predecessor george 
meany in defining labors objective 
the key role of the trade union is to see that the big guys 
dont kick the little guys around kirkland told the more than 
900 delegates they need it now more than ever when the legacy of 
the reagan years exacting its cost in all walks of life 
delegates to the 141 millionmember federations convention 
will have a busy week welcoming solidarity leader lech walesa 
plotting future support for several major strikes and hearing from 
a us president for the first time in a decade 
also on tap are addresses by democratic congressional leaders 
and the election of the federations officers with kirkland a 
shooin for a sixth twoyear term as president 
walesas appearance to thank us unions for their support in 
solidaritys struggle will be by far the most captivating public 
event 
walesa will finally receive the george meany human rights award 
which the union bestowed on him eight years ago he was not allowed 
to leave poland to receive it 
labor leaders will meet privately with walesa to determine how 
the aflcio can assist solidarity now that poland has a 
sympathetic noncommunist government and how to emulate the 
success of the polish labor movement in other european countries 
such as east germany hungary and lithuania 
we dont have to seek out our clients kirkland said in an 
interview last week they come to us we are in spite of what 
our detractors say in this country the largest in many ways the 
strongest the most unified and the most deeply involved trade 
union federation around the world 
the federation provided solidarity with an estimated 5 million 
worth of communications and other equipment and support 
wherever working people are trying to lift themselves up and 
form free trade associations they always come to us for help 
kirkland said as these movements are developing in central and 
eastern europe we are going to have increasing demands upon us and 
well do our best to respond 
the celebration of the success abroad comes at a time of 
uncertainty at home for the labor movement which has struggled 
throughout the 1980s with the losses in the industrial sector its 
traditional organizing strength and its battle with the reagan 
administration over issues ranging from the minimum wage to child 
care to plant closings 
kirkland just a month ago referred to president bush as reagan 
lite but last week said the presidents willingness to strike a 
compromise on raising the minimum wage showed there had been some 
improvement over the strained relations with the reagan white house 
we have channels of communication that i think are superior to 
those that we had during the reagan years he said things are 
not so ideologically hostile 
bush has agreed to address the convention wednesday 
reagan refused to speak in 1981 and was never invited again 
jimmy carter was the last president to address a federation 
convention in 1979 
the celebration of walesas first visit to the united states 
will be coupled with welcoming back the united mine workers 
rejoining the federation 40 years after the legendary john l lewis 
pulled out because of a political fight 
the reception of the umw however also serves to underscore the 
renewed move toward militancy by major unions 
the umws strike against pittston coal group is one of four that 
will receive the attention of the delegates beginning today when 
the conventions theme of solidarity is underscored by a procession 
of workers on strike against pittston eastern airlines nynex 
corp and boeing 
kirkland and other labor leaders believe unions have turned the 
corner in organizing the growth sectors of the economy 
particularly health care and the service industries but 
increasingly are supporting hardline stands to prevent further 
erosion of labors numbers in the areas of its traditional strength 
i think were coming out of a very difficult period in 
remarkably good shape and with the highest degree of internal 
solidarity and cohesiveness than weve ever had kirkland said in 
the interview 
in his report to the delegates however he sounded a more 
strident and militant note if we are to advance in this hostile 
climate there is only one way for trade unionists to turn and 
that is to each other

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether public school boards and school officials may be sued in 
state court not only in federal court for allegedly violating a 
students rights 
the justices said they will hear an appeal by a former florida 
high school student who says his rights were violated when an 
assistant principal broke into his car parked on school grounds in 
1986 
the student mark howlett later was suspended from st 
petersburg high school for five days for having alcoholic beverages 
in the car 
howlett and his mother elizabeth howlett accused the pinellas 
county school board and school officials of violating a federal 
civil rights law enacted in 1871 
a state appeals court dismissed the suit on grounds the state 
had not surrendered immunity for school boards and officials 
school officials and school boards as state agents enjoy 
broad but not absolute protection from federal lawsuits the 
supreme court has ruled that local governments and their officials 
may be sued under the 1871 law only if it can be proved the alleged 
violation of civil rights is part of an official policy 
the howlett case gives the high court an opportunity to set 
guidelines for such suits in state courts 
assistant principal thomas petit entered howletts locked 
volkswagen by pushing in a side window the car was blocking a 
construction site at the school and petit and others were tyring 
to move it 
once inside the car petit said he found three empty wine cooler 
bottles and another bottle containing alcoholic eggnog 
students are forbidden from taking alcohol onto school grounds 
howlett was criminally charged with illegal possession of alcohol 
on school property 
the charge was dismissed by a judge but howlett also was 
suspended from school for five days causing him automatically to 
get failing grades for part of a school term 
he later graduated from the high school and enrolled at st 
petersburg junior college 
a florida appeals court last feb 1 dismissed the civil rights 
suit filed by howlett and his mother 
the appeals court said the state has not waived its sovereign 
immunity from suits against it in its own state courts in such 
cases 
the state court said ground rules established by the supreme 
court are all distinguishable because they deal primarily with 
immunity in federal courts 
the case is howlett vs rose 895383

a federal advisory panel said today it has 
approved evacuation plans for massachusetts communities near the 
seabrook nh nuclear power plant and recommended that the 
embattled facility receive a fullpower license 
the atomic safety and licensing board overruled the objections 
of massachusetts officials and environmental groups and said 
evacuation plans for residents of six northeastern massachusetts 
communities are adequate to protect public safety 
the board also ruled that an evacuation exercise conducted last 
year in massachusetts and new hampshire was adequate in scope and 
revealed no fundamental flaw 
although massachusetts attorney general james shannon can appeal 
the decision within 10 days the 63 billion reactor could receive 
a fullpower license even before the appeals run their course said 
nuclear regulatory commission spokesman john kopeck seabrook 
officials have said they expect the plant to be licensed around the 
first of next year 
the next step in the complex process involves a 30day review 
period by the nrc a public hearing held by the full commission at 
which the nrc staff makes its recommendations on the plant and a 
final decision on issuing a license by the commission 
shannon has already said he would appeal a ruling by the 
licensing board to the higherlevel atomic safety and licensing 
appeal board and from there to the full nrc if as shannon said he 
expects the nrc decides to issue a fullpower license he has said 
he will challenge that ruling in federal court 
completion of the plant was delayed by nearly a decade by legal 
challenges by environmentists cost overruns changes required 
during construction and financial problems encountered by the 
facilitys principal owner public service co of new hampshire 
the plant originally was projected to cost 1 billion and go 
into service in 1979 
in its 571page ruling dated nov 9 and made public today the 
threemember licensing board found reasonable assurance that 
adequate protective measures can and will be taken in the event of 
a radiological emergency at the seabrook station in accordance 
with the commissions emergency planning regulations and precedents 
 
the licensing board cleared away another potential obstacle to 
swift issuance of a fullpower license by ruling that a recent 
appeal board decision on the new hampshire evacuation plans posed 
no major problem in the licensing process 
several flaws in the new hampshire plans found by the appeal 
board do not preclude the immediate issuance of an operating 
license for the seabrook station the board said 
plant spokesman ron sher called the decision a major 
development that brings seabrook closer to a fullpower license 
he added the emergency plans for seabrook have been evaluated 
by the experts the federal emergency management agency the staff 
of the nrc and the advisory committee on reactor safeguards and 
their conclusions are that seabrooks emergency plans are among the 
best in the country 
sher said that only in the event of a highly unlikely site 
emergency or general emergency at the plant would the plans 
involving warning sirens radio broadcasts and possible evacuation 
of school children residents and tourists swing into action 
the evacuation plans for massachusetts involve six communities 
in the northeastern corner of the state just south of the seabrook 
plant amesbury merrimack newbury newburyport salisbury and 
west newbury total population of the region is about 50000 with a 
peak of about 90000 during the summer months

more government officials are using bodyguards 
for protection these days although some cabinet members still 
prefer to travel around town with only a driver or an aide 
according to an informal survey 
in general security for top officials has been beefed up during 
the 1980s a decade punctuated by terrorist threats and activities 
like the bombing of pam am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland 
last december 
bodyguards are just one manifestation of the heightened security 
theres been a big upsurge in security said chuck vance a 
former secret service agent who now runs a 20 millionayear 
security company vance international theres been an increased 
concern 
for instance several months ago threats from colombian drug 
cartels reportedly prompted president bush to order an increase in 
secret service protection for some of his children 
and william bennett director of the nations drug policy 
receives protection from the us marshals services a part of the 
justice department 
certainly there is a threat to be considered as far as dr 
bennetts work is concerned said bill dempsey a spokesman for 
the service 
the marshals function is to provide security for the judiciary 
including federal judges and juries but they protect others like 
bennett when ordered to do so by the attorney general dempsey said 
a check of several agencies revealed a broad range of personal 
security from the knot of secret service agents protecting bush to 
the single staff aide who goes around town with labor secretary 
elizabeth dole or the driver who accompanies jack kemp the 
secretary of housing and urban development 
many agencies are reluctant to talk about the security provided 
officials for fear of attracting unwanted attention the secret 
service with its 364 million budget and 1900 special agents 
only discusses security in broad terms 
the cost to the taxpayer of providing roundtheclock protection 
is also difficult to determine because it is often included in an 
overall security budget officials say 
transportation secretary samuel skinner oversees an office of 19 
security people with a budget of 41 million according to 
spokesman bob marx but protecting skinner is only one of the 
officers duties marx said 
they also do criminal investigations make security checks on 
new employees and supervise the system that protects the building 
from penetration by eavesdropping devices 
there is some debate over the value of bodyguards 
while vance favors a wide range of preventive measures 
security systems in houses and concrete barriers to buildings to 
name a few he said the bodyguard business sometimes gets 
overdone 
trained security agents can deter trouble too many guards can 
be counterproductive he said you will attract nuts if there is 
a big security splash 
the secret service part of the treasury department protects 
the president the vice president their immediate families 
treasury secretary nicholas brady presidential candidates and 
visiting heads of state 
while the bodyguard function is important he said the agents 
major task is to secure a public area the advance work 
security is taking away the opportunity to harm vance said

east german news media once dull purveyors of 
communist party propaganda gave full coverage to the frenzy and 
frolic of the historic weekend party as thousands of berliners 
celebrated on both sides of the border 
the national broadcast network showed east germans peeking into 
sex shops in hamburgs famed reeperbahn red light district and 
radio brought the sound of popping corks and crashing glass as 
revelers celebrated with champagne atop the berlin wall 
viewers watched their countrymen lining up for visas at border 
crossings and clogging central streets with a sea of smokespewing 
compacts all pointed toward the newly opened gates through the 
berlin wall 
east germany suspended all travel curbs late thursday under 
pressure from a broad democracy movement and the newly reformed 
press stepped in to record the moment 
enterprising east german reporters interviewed the westbound 
countrymen roaming the visa queues to inquire about individual 
dreams or plans of visits abroad 
events of historic proportions declared the neue zeit 
newspaper at the top of its front page monday with pictures of 
happy travelers streaming out and the graffitisplattered west side 
of the wall 
a border that doesnt divide claimed der morgan another 
newspaper aligned with officialdom 
less than a month ago the airwaves and periodicals were drab 
organs of party propaganda with dull diatribes against the 
decadent west and selfcongratulating claims of socialist 
superiority 
tv coverage lacked the sparkle of western broadcasts but the 
frank and supportive reports would have been unthinkable less than 
a month ago 
cameras captured the breadth of the backup of sputtering 
trabants and wartburgs filling unter den linden as the freed 
tourists headed west 
radio and the state news agency adn gave regular updates on the 
numbers of citizens crossing out for a look at the longforbidden 
other germany 
even neues deutschland the comparatively stubborn communist 
party daily reported monday that 43 million visas had been issued 
since thursday 
but the main party organ led its front page with reports on a 
central committee session and leader egon krenzs telephone chat 
with west german chancellor helmut kohl

vice president dan quayle said 
today that the eventual reunification of germany is inevitable and 
that when it comes the rejoined nation will be allied with the 
forces of freedom and democracy which is the west 
east germany is east germany because of the communist 
system quayle said do away with the communist system and its 
germany 
the vice president told the republican governors association 
that the gop has delivered on the issues of peace and opportunity 
in the 1980s and that it is no accident that the forces of 
freedom and democracy are on the march in eastern europe 
he said it is democrats not president bush who have been timid 
in dealing with change at home and abroad because all they want to 
do is spend more money 
the democrats havent offered one creative idea on how to 
manage the evolving situation in eastern europe or the soviet union 
except to criticize the president qualye told a group of 
reporters later he said the administration has been properly 
cautious but still out front on this issue 
in germany where the east german government has opened the 
berlin wall permitting free travel to the west and has promised 
elections eventually you will see reunification quayle said 
in the interview its going to take some time 
he said that reunification would not mean the elimination of the 
north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact but would 
require a change in the responsibilities of those military 
alliances in western relations with the soviet bloc and in the 
institutions and culture of east germany itself 
a unified germany in defense alliances will continue to 
look west it will continue to be allied with the forces of freedom 
and democracy which is the west quayle said 
at the same time he cautioned against unilateral reductions in 
us troop strength in europe saying that precipitous cuts could 
damage both western security and the movement toward freedom in the 
east 
quayle was the keynote speaker as the republican governors 
opened a day and a half of conferences on politics issues and 
problems of state government 
fifteen of the 22 gop state governors were on hand at the first 
major party gathering since the nov 7 elections in which virginia 
and new jersey elected democratic governors 
but association leaders said the outcome was no surprise 
the new jersey defeat will thin the ranks of the gop governors 
to 21 virginia will remain democratic unless a recount overturns 
the closest gubernatorial election in state history 
gov mike hayden of kansas chairman of the republican 
governors said sunday night that last weeks balloting confirmed 
what the party already knew there is a big job ahead if the gop is 
going to elect more governors next year 
he told a news conference it is vital that republicans 
aggressively recruit the best candidates available asked whether 
that meant that the gop candidates this year james courter in new 
jersey and j marshall coleman in virginia were not the strongest 
of entries he replied well they didnt win 
one issue that hurt them was abortion which both men opposed 
but on which both tempered their positions during the campaign 
hayden and his colleagues said republicans could defuse that issue 
by handling it headon in 1990 
gov carroll a campbell jr of south carolina said republican 
candidates should spell out clear positions on the abortion issue 
and avoid being typecast simply as prolife or antiabortion 
politicians 
campbell is opposed to abortion except in cases of rape incest 
or threat to the life of the mother but he bristled at a question 
describing him as a prolife republican calling it an 
oversimplification 
campbell said republicans running in 1989 allowed themselves to 
be cornered on the issue while democrats were able to define their 
own views and the positions of their gop rivals as well 
youll beat nothing with something every time you put it on 
the table he said 
quayle joined the governors in a golf tournament sunday his 
team finished second 
he and lee atwater the republican national chairman were 
delivering the administrations political message to the governors 
looking toward a 1990 campaign in which 36 states will elect 
governors 34 will choose senators and all 435 house seats will be 
at stake 
atwater was concentrating on the politics of reapportionment 
governors and legislatures chosen in 1990 will have a major hand in 
reapportioning house seats after next years census the party that 
controls state government controls the crucial redistricting 
process 
attorney general dick thornburgh and william bennett director 
of the office of national drug control policy also are addressing 
the governors

for germans this is a time of 
happiness relief and even national pride after four decades of 
living with the cold war division of the two countries 
the opening of east germanys borders and the crumbling of the 
berlin wall at times seemed impossible but then happened overnight 
this is our germany our country said an exuberant lutz 
hermann of east berlin as he joined hundreds of thousands of others 
in passing freely through the wall to the west 
germans long have been engulfed by the cold war a product of 
adolf hitlers murderous nazi legacy 
the wall in berlin the communist border fortifications the 
east germans gunned down trying to escape to the west formed a part 
of daily life 
now with the wall a relic of the past and borders between the 
countries open germans who embraced each with tears of joy sense 
that an end to the cold war division may be within reach 
in recent days as the world looks upon berlin and germany no 
one needs to be ashamed of his tears said the conservative 
frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper in a frontpage editorial 
sunday 
the newspaper in a special edition marking east germanys new 
border policy added they the germans have had to live long 
enough with a border that has ripped apart villages and families 
even west germanys leftist politicians long skeptical of 
demands for german reunification in recent days have become fond 
of quoting the national anthems call for unity as well as 
justice and freedom for the german nation 
in east berlin the euphoric reaction has come from the people 
rather than from the government which remains fiercely opposed to 
any trends toward reunification 
millions of ordinary east germans poured into the west over the 
weekend in the largest eastwest party in history 
yet the happiness relief and pride still leave many issues 
open 
in east germany the government still must figure out which way 
to turn now that it has raised the peoples hopes to a fever pitch 
giving people the freedom to travel wont solve the massive 
problems caused by the exodus of tens of thousands nor will it 
solve such tricky questions as whether east berlin will allow truly 
free elections 
in west germany national pride itself remains a sensitive 
issue as rightwing extremists preach a message of being proud 
to be german and make startling political gains 
bonn also also faces enormous difficulties now that west 
germany has taken on the burden of absorbing so many east german 
refugees 
the question is whether bonn after years of urging open 
borders will erect its own restrictions to keep out east germans 
by means of a kind of invisible wall 
both countries remain at the front lines of officially hostile 
military alliances with 250000 us soldiers stationed in west 
germany and nearly 400000 soviet troops in east germany 
the nazi legacy itself will still be an issue for germans 
despite the growing complaint from conservative historians that it 
is a past that will not go into the past 
newspaper editorials leading intellectuals and politicians on 
sunday all expressed ambivalent feelings welcoming the east 
germans new freedom but questioning the dangers posed by a united 
germany

dot harkness banked on her pension plan 
borrowed money against it and planned to do some traveling with her 
ailing husband in the utah hills when she retired then she found 
out the savings she counted on had vanished in a bad investment 
james carsten worked for a jewelry repair shop for 30 years and 
figured hed be due about 19000 in pension benefits instead 
all the money disappeared he said 
mrs harkness and carsten were victimized by plans that werent 
insured by the federal governments pension benefits guaranty 
corporation according to government figures only 40 million of 
the 76 million workers with private pension plans are eligible for 
that protection 
by law pension fund managers are prohibited from putting all 
the money into a single investment they also are required to 
ensure that any risks are reasonable 
but small programs those with 25 or fewer participants dont 
qualify for federal insurance and even the larger programs can be 
undermined by bad investments or outright theft 
the little guys have an especially hard time making their 
cases if their funds are abused says the labor departments acting 
inspector general raymond maria 
people are sort of desperate says karen ferguson director 
of the pension rights center a public interest group theres no 
one to help them if the people who are running the plan are 
bankrupt theres nothing to do and there are a lot of them out 
there 
the labor departments pension and welfare benefits 
adminstration is charged with investigating abuses but mrs 
harkness and carsten said they received no satisfaction from the 
government 
mrs harkness 63 worked as a receptionist for a doctor 
handling his billing setting up appointments and answering the 
phones the practice was sold in 1978 but she stayed on and figured 
her nest egg was safe 
i was fully vested so i didnt worry mrs harkness said in 
a telephone interview from her park city utah home 
in 1983 she took out an 8500 loan against her pension to buy 
a 1978 motor home and began paying back 200 a month including 14 
percent interest into the account she figured she had about 
20000 in the pension fund 
in 1987 she said she received a call shortly before midnight 
from the doctor for whom she was first employed saying we had 
lost all our money the account had gone down the tubes 
after failing to get help from the labor department mrs 
harkness notified the pension rights center which referred her to 
an attorney and the case rests with the courts 
we were very conservative and raised three children mrs 
harkness said i counted on this money 
while mrs harkness sounds distraught carsten is angry 
ive spent three years trying to get my money and ive just 
wasted my time he said in a telephone interview from his 
seattle wash home 
the company he worked for was sold and the investment group 
administering the plan went bankrupt after reportedly investing in 
palm trees 
carsten went to the labor department and wrote letters to his 
congressmen 
but the sheer size of the nations private pension system works 
against individuals such as carsten and mrs harkness with just 
300 inspectors the government can check only a tiny percentage of 
the countrys 870000 such programs enforcement actions by and 
large have focused on the bigger offenders 
carsten meanwhile says he cant afford an attorney to pursue 
his case on his own thats all i have for retirement he said

international mail has no frontiers kr 
murthy of india declared monday as he opened the 20th congress of 
the universal postal union 
president bush welcoming delegates from nearly 170 nations to 
the session said that the worldwide mail system remains essential 
despite the growth in electronic communications 
the need to communicate by mail across national frontiers 
despite the march of time and the advent of telecommunications 
has remained constant bush told the formal opening session of 
the congress 
only the postal system can reach and serve every man woman 
and child on this planet every day and do so at a price that is in 
their reach said us postmaster general anthony m frank 
the delegates will wrestle with international mail agreements 
and disputes for the next five weeks in a meeting held only every 
five years this is the first time since 1897 that the congress has 
been held in the united states 
if the international postal system is to prosper there is a 
compelling need for the progress of all members said murthy dean 
of the meeting and former director general of the indian postal 
service 
representatives come from nations with different goals and 
needs murthy observed with some nations needing to employ more 
technological advances and others needing to update antiquated 
systems 
as we approach the turn of the century we suddenly find many 
rural communities and hitherto predominately agricultural nations 
newly involved in industry trade and commerce in everincreasing 
measure said murthy 
postal administrations in developed as well as developing 
countries now face a wider variety of demands from an enthusiastic 
and exacting cleintele he said 
complex technical questions are expected to dominate the 
gathering with one major focus on international payment for mail 
delivery 
under current rules the weight of mail shipped between nations 
is compared annually and the nation sending more out pays the 
countries receiving it for their delivery services proposals for 
some changes in that system are being considered including the 
possibility of measuring the number of items exchanged rather than 
merely the weight of the mail shipped 
decisions are made by consensus at the gathering with each 
nation having one vote 
the universal postal union was formed in the mid1800s in an 
effort to solve the confusing system in which each nation had to 
have separate agreements with other nations to exchange mail

the bush administration said today the 
usbacked el salvador government has not asked for help in 
combating a guerrilla offensive that left at least 139 people dead 
and prompted president alfredo cristiani to declare a state of 
siege 
its our belief that they the government are in control of 
the situation at this point white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said 
asked if he would rule out any us involvement in the fighting 
fitzwater said we can never predict the future but at this 
point its not anticipated 
fiftyfive us military trainers are stationed in el salvador 
but are not supposed to accompany the salvadoran armed forces on 
military missions fitzwater said there was no change in the status 
of the us serivcemen 
ial buildings saturday night and occupied 
several sectors of the northern part of san salvador 
cheney appearing on nbcs meet the press said weve 
got of course advisers in el salvador but i think the government 
of el salvador can handle it 
i think theres a bit of a view that the attack on the city 
basically is a move of desperation by the guerrillas that the fmln 
farabundo marti national liberation front is under a lot of 
pressure from the salvadoran government and that this is an effort 
to try to dramatize their posture cheney said 
baker interviewed on abcs this week with david brinkley 
said that as far as we know this morning the american community 
is accounted for that is the americans residents in el salvador 
and the diplomats and military people that we have there 
i can tell you that i believe there has been one american 
casualty a schoolteacher killed there are no other american 
casualties as far as i know he said he did not identify the 
teacher 
this appears to be an action that the insurgency in el 
salvador the fmln has undertaken a rather desperate action in 
my view to disrupt the negotiations that they were having with 
the government toward seeking a political accommodation 
baker said he didnt believe the offensive would destabilize the 
salvadoran government 
i think the government of el salvador can handle this 
militarily and defensively he said 
the attacks came three days after the fmln promised to intensify 
its insurgency against the government more than 70000 people have 
been killed in the guerrilla war

for east berliner peter normann monday was a 
return to reality after a heady weekend of freedom celebrations 
now things must go back to normal the 32yearold 
construction worker said as he took a cigarette break on the site 
of a new office complex and glanced at the berlin wall less than 
100 yards away 
other east berliners braving the gray morning chill on their way 
to the office work bench or factory floor shared normanns view 
that the party was over 
in all more than 3 million east germans headed west during the 
weekend and officials said 99 percent of them then returned home 
the euphoria of the weekend many young east berliners had 
never been to the west until then was tinged with worry for some 
money and the east german economy were among common concerns 
i really dont know whether i should be happy or pensive 
said michael werner gunning his massive volga taxi through a 
yellow light shortly after picking up a western visitor on a 
neardeserted main thoroughfare 
most streets appeared normally quiet but there was lively 
traffic going both ways at the checkpoint charlie crossing point 
werner pointed to long lines at several banks and police precinct 
stations as evidence that things were not the same 
people were filling out forms for visas to go west or queuing to 
buy the annual allotment of 15 west german marks allowed them by 
the state for visits to west berlin 
werner was born sept 21 1961 a little more than a month 
after east german military and paramilitary units began work on the 
wall he crossed over to west berlin for the first time early 
friday just hours after the communist east berlin government eased 
travel restrictions 
after queuing in west berlin for more than an hour he was given 
100 west german marks 54 in welcome money that was a small 
treasure compared with the annual entitlement allowed by his 
government but werner didnt spend a pfennig 
i didnt know what to do he confided sheepishly things 
cost so much over there and then there are differences in prices 
depending on which store you go to its not like over here 
money for the west also was carpenter dieter voelcovs worry as 
he finished a hearty breakfast of bauernschmaus an omelette with 
diced ham and potatoes at the nordring bier bar in the heart of 
the city 
while the east german mark is not freely convertible many west 
berlin stores accepted them over the weekend but their rate of one 
west mark to 10 east marks irritated some east berliners 
what am i going to do with 100 west marks a year if i can go 
over as often as i want he groused wiping beer foam off his 
mustache the freedom to travel is our main theme at work but we 
always come back to the same thing where to get hard currency 
coworker dieter boy agreed suggesting that east germany was at 
the mercy of the economic powerhouse of the west one of the 
excuses offered by the communists for building the wall in the 
first place 
if this continues the west is going to buy us out 
exclaimed boy a stocky 28yearold were either all going to 
end up working over there or well spend anything we make here on 
the other side of the wall 
the everyday frustrations of monday in east berlin came home to 
a man in line for oranges brought in once a year from spain in 
time for christmas who was told the oranges had run out 
this is what socialism looks like he exclaimed bitterly to 
those standing behind him we still have a long way to go 
despite the weekend

lebanons new president designated 
veteran moslem politician salim hoss as prime minister monday and 
gen michel aoun the christian army commander rejected the choice 
hoss and aoun have led rival moslem and christian governments 
since the sixyear term of president amin gemayel ended in 
september 1988 with parliament unable to agree on a successor 
aoun issued a statement monday saying the hoss nomination was 
as unconstitutional as the election nov 5 of president rene 
mouawad 
the session at which parliament elected mouawad and endorsed a 
peace plan was held in syriancontrolled north lebanon because aoun 
threatened to shell the parliament building in beirut 
mouawad a christian instructed hoss to form a national 
reconciliation government with the mission of ending the 
14yearold sectarian civil war in which more than 150000 people 
have been killed 
police reported exchanges of artillery and smallarms fire 
across beiruts sectarian dividing line between aouns christian 
army units and moslem militias backed by syria each side accused 
the other of starting the battle and no casualty reports were 
available 
a sixmonth artillery war between aouns men and a moslem 
alliance led by the syrians killed at least 930 people and wounded 
2744 before a truce arranged by the arab league ended it in 
september 
syria has 40000 soldiers in lebanon under an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976 the year after the war began 
aoun calls the syrians an occupation force and has declared a war 
of liberation to drive them out 
later monday aoun said this will be an unconstitutional 
government it will not be a national reconciliation government it 
will represent one side even if the whole world recognizes it 
hoss government will be a government operating in the shadow of 
syrian occupation governments cannot survive only on foreign 
recognition 
aoun spoke to the associated press in his bunker beneath the 
shattered presidential palace in baabda east of beirut which he 
has refused to leave since mouawads election 
mouawad 64 designated hoss 59 a sunni moslem after three 
days of consultations with political leaders 
hoss accepted the job for the third time in 13 years and said 
the 55th government since independence from france in 1943 would 
implement the peace accord worked out in taif saudia arabia which 
includes a plan for sharing power between christians and moslems 
christians were the majority in 1943 and have controlled the 
government army and judiciary but moslems now account for about 
55 percent of the population and have demanded an equal role in 
running the country 
mouawad hoss and hussein husseini the shiite moslem who is 
speaker of parliament received about 50 foreign ambassadors at the 
presidents temporary headquarters the prime ministers office in 
moslem west beirut 
i call upon all of you to join our march toward peace 
mouawad said in a sevenminute address we consider the taif 
accord an introduction to peace and a launching pad for a new 
republic based on equality among all lebanese 
i pledge to whole world to consolidate the unity and 
sovereignty of lebanon and to rebuild its constitutional 
institutions 
the united states was not represented at the meeting which 
underscored international recognition of mouawad because its 
embassy was closed sept 6 after aoun supporters put it under siege 
iran boycotted the meeting the iranians and the hezbollah 
militia their main ally in lebanon have rejected the taif accord 
because it does not give the major say in government to the 12 
million shiites the largest sect in lebanon 
hoss first became prime minister under the late president elias 
sarkis soon after the syrian army intervention in 1976 he 
returned to the post when prime minister rashid karami was 
assassinated in june 1 1987

the white house today hailed the glorious 
sight of people exercising new freedoms in east germany but said 
we can understand and even expect that most east germans will 
stay and help rebuild their country rather than flee 
spokesman marlin fitzwater also virtually ruled out any 
possibility that president bush will add a stopover in berlin to 
next months shipboard meeting with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev in the mediterreanean off malta 
the white house has emphasized the informality of that meeting 
fitzwater said today the leaders will use it to give a push to 
all the talks on both nuclear and conventional arms control 
however we do not intend to have this emerge as a second 
yalta he said referring to the 1945 meeting where franklin 
roosevelt winston churchill and josef stalin met to carve up the 
boundaries of postwar europe 
on the dramatic events in east germany fitzwater said one of 
the most glorious aspects of this weekends activities was seeing 
so many people not only discover but exercise those freedoms for 
the first time 
but when asked by reporters what advice bush would give the 
masses of east germans who eventually returned to their side of the 
border the spokesman replied 
we wont encourage them one way or another except as the 
president did last friday and say in these times of dramatically 
changing reform events are so exciting and so many possibilities 
on the horizon we can certainly understand and even expect that 
most east germans would want to be a part of this change 
meanwhile today vice president dan quayle told a gathering of 
republican governors on hilton head island sc that the eventual 
reunification of germany is inevitable and that when it comes the 
rejoined nation will be allied with the forces of freedom and 
democracy which is the west 
quayle disputed complaints by democrats that bush has been timid 
in dealing with change at home and abroad contending that all they 
want to do is spend more money 
the democrats havent offered one creative idea on how to 
manage the evolving situation in eastern europe or the soviet union 
except to criticize the president quayle said in an interview 
after his speech he said the administration has been properly 
cautious but still out front on this issue 
on the dec 23 meeting with gorbachev fitzwater said we do 
not intend to have this emerge as a second yalta and we do not 
intend to engage in the kinds of decisionmaking that would lead 
you to that kind of conclusion 
but he added i think they want to give a push to all the 
talks youre going to see them emerge and urge progress on cfe 
conventional forces in europe and start strategic arms 
reduction and all the arms control talks 
it clearly is an effort to provide progress in these areas 
but thats far different than negotiating specific points 
fitzwater said 
asked about the possibility that bush would visit berlin the 
spokesman said we cant foresee any set of circumstances at this 
moment that would induce him to go 
he said the president is still weighing a reply to a message 
gorbachev sent friday backing the changes made by east germanys 
new leaders and expressing hope that the situation will remain 
peaceful 
tonight bush will present lech walesa with the presidential 
medal of freedom in a white house ceremony walesa is the 
solidarity leader whose labor movement propelled poland into the 
vanguard of the shift toward democracy in the communist east bloc 
on sunday soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennadi gerasimov 
said of bushs response to the joyous tumult in east berlin i 
think hes handling it as a real statesman 
secretary of state james a baker iii emphasized that the 
administration wants to encourage this move toward openness in 
eastern europe but to do so in a way that doesnt seek 
unilateral advantage and doesnt promote instability 
gerasimov interviewed on cbstvs face the nation 
predicted that bush and gorbachev at their dec 23 shipboard 
summit off malta may come to a common ground that both 
countries and actually everybody is interested in stability in 
not too much upheaval in europe 
baker on abctvs this week with david brinkley called the 
opening of east germanys borders historic but said it 
doesnt mean a whole lot in economic terms 
for the united states to consider coming to the economic aid of 
east germany baker said it first must be convinced the rulers of 
the once hardline communist state are moving toward a freemarket 
system 
it would be wrong to have a different standard for east 
germany than we do for poland and hungary baker said we are 
somewhat constrained in what we can do before there is clear 
evidence that they want to reform their economic system 
baker said he believes moscow would draw the line at any attempt 
by its east bloc allies to withdraw from the warsaw pact the 
communist alliances counterpart to the wests north atlantic 
treaty organization 
but baker said they have made it very clear to us that 
they will not use force in eastern europe 
baker said the united states would welcome the eventual 
reunification of the two germanies as long as that reunification 
comes about on the basis of western values but he stressed it is 
too soon to make the great leap from right of free travel on 
the part of east germans to the question of reunification

four prominent human rights 
activists went on trial monday in bratislava on charges of sedition 
for urging slovaks to lay flowers in memory of those killed in the 
1968 warsaw pact invasion 
miroslav kusy hana ponicka anton selecky and vladimir manak 
were charged with sedition in august together with fellow human 
rights activist jan carnogursky the face as many as five years in 
jail 
the five signed a statement urging slovaks to mark the 21st 
anniversary of the sovietled aug 21 1968 invasion which crushed 
communist reform in czechoslovakia 
kusy a former communist party central committee secretary 
during the 1968 prague spring reform period who was later expelled 
from the party also is charged with subversion 
carnogursky who also faces sedition and subversion charges 
went on trial nov 6 but the proceedings were adjourned because 
his defense lawyer suffered a circulatory collapse and could not 
attend no date was set for a new trial 
emigre sources in vienna said that the defense on monday asked 
that the four be tried together with carnogursky the official ctk 
news agency said the court heard the defendants but then adjourned 
the proceedings until tuesday 
the trials epitomize a crackdown on dissent in czechoslovakia 
whose hardline communist leaders have refused to follow the reform 
path taken by other warsaw pact countries most czechoslovak 
leaders were installed after the 1968 invasion 
in poland hungary the soviet union and now in east germany 
communists have either agreed to share power or at least permitted 
opposition groups to publicize their opinions and hold large 
demonstrations 
czechoslovakia has taken one of the hardest lines against 
dissent last month batonwielding police in prague dispersed up 
to 10000 demonstrators who called for freedom and a new government 
still active opposition is growing slowly the activists 
trials in bratislava have sparked considerable protest even from 
some establishment intellectuals and last week about 200 people 
demonstrated outside bratislavas palace of justice to demand 
carnogurskys release they also chanted calls for freedom and 
human rights

the house on monday approved a bill requiring 
trade sanctions against any country that uses chemical or 
biological weapons in violation of international law 
the measure similar to a bill pending before the senate would 
require the president to choose from a variety of penalties if he 
determines that a country has used such weapons such as in iraqs 
actions during the persian gulf war and against its own kurdish 
minority 
possible actions include prohibition of us arms sales to the 
offending nation export of goods and technology which could be 
used to make chemical weapons restriction of imports from the 
country a cutoff of any foreign aid opposition to loans from 
multilateral banks and suspension of diplomatic relations 
proponents said they recognize that us sanctions alone would 
be relatively ineffective because arms and chemicals are available 
from other sources and the bill urges the administration to 
encourage other countries to join in any sanctions it imposes 
the measure allows the president to waive the sanctions if they 
would not be in the national security interests of the united 
states

the customs service should not buy any more 
frontline radar planes for detecting drugferrying aircraft until 
electronics problems are resolved the chairman of a senate 
appropriations panel said monday 
sen dennis deconcini chairman of the appropriations 
subcommittee that funded the purchase of p3 airborne early warning 
aircraft said customs must get the two planes already in service 
operating fully by march or refuse delivery of a third plane in 
april 
if they dont fix it im going to come down on them hard 
said deconcini dariz chairman of the senate appropriations 
subcommittee on treasury postal service and general government 
deconcini said customs service aircrews have told him that 
problems in tracking and locating suspect planes are not being 
addressed what we may have is a breakdown where supervisors have 
not responded to these complaints he said in an interview 
if they dont adhere to the suggestion to fix the problems or 
postpone delivery ill have a hearing and it wont be pleasant 
im very interested being the chairman of the funding committee 
in not letting a new contract when we dont have one that works 
customs service documents show that the planes have been plagued 
by an unreliable computer system that has trouble pinpointing the 
location of targets and following their course and speed faulty 
onboard communications for the crew and problems with a spinning 
metal radar dome most documents were written by crewmen at 
customs surveillance support center in corpus christi texas 
where the radar planes are based 
the acting director of the customs service surveillance center 
peter kendig has acknowledged there are a few glitches in the 
computer systems but said the p3 aircraft works and it works 
great he said the two planes now flying were mainly responsible 
for detections leading to 36 arrests from jan 1 to aug 10 this 
year seizures of 37000 pounds of marijuana and 8300 pounds of 
cocaine as well as vessels aircraft and vehicles 
the lockheed p3 is a fourengine turboprop that was built for 
detecting enemy submarines but two of them were outfitted with the 
most sophisticated electronics available and sold to the customs 
service to detect airborne drug smugglers lockheed hopes to sell 
the p3 as a surveillance plane to other countries for military 
use as a competitor to existing detection aircraft 
the first p3 airborne early warning aircraft was delivered in 
june 1988 at a cost of more than 27 million and the second 
arrived last april at a price of 306 million the third plane is 
scheduled to be delivered to the customs service next april at a 
cost of 35 million money already appropriated by congress 
the major electronics problem documented in customs memos and 
in interviews with customs service sources and lockheed officials 
is the computerized tracker the equipment is designed to 
automatically plot the course and speed of a suspect aircraft but 
it is sometimes so inaccurate that the p3 cannot reliably guide 
interceptors to the suspected smugglers according to customs 
service memos and interviews with agency sources 
lockheeds airborne early warning program manager john 
mcginnis has said in interviews he hopes anomalous behavior in 
the tracker will be fixed by the first of the year he 
contended that despite the discrepancies the airplane and the 
tracker are very capable and doing their job 
meanwhile rep glenn english dokla who has guided the p3 
program through the house said the house government operations 
committee on which he serves will ask the general accounting office 
to investigate the program he also has asked chairman john 
conyers dmich to schedule hearings

the new traffic light is unpopular 
and the occasional aftershocks are unsettling but residents of 
this old logging town say theyre coping with the changes wrought 
by the oct 17 earthquake 
they admit to being nervous though 
any sudden noise will do it i have one foot inside and one 
foot outside the door said randy vanderstelt one of 6000 
residents of boulder creek which is nestled in the santa cruz 
mountains near the epicenter of the quake 
although boulder creek 12 miles northeast of santa cruz is 
primarily a commuter town not all traces of its logging heritage 
have been swept aside a streak of stubborn independence still 
lingers amid the redwood storefronts bearing names such as the 
rex hotel or the brandy bakery 
that tradition of independence is one reason some quake victims 
only now are seeking help said steve taylor owner of the 
groundskeeper coffee shop 
some just now are coming out of the mountains for 
assistance taylor said they felt they could do it themselves 
its part of what theyre here for they just realized they need 
help 
talking and sharing experiences has helped ease worries and 
trauma he said 
one hot topic of conversation is the new downtown traffic light 
the towns first the state department of transportation 
installed it on highway 9 the twolane road that cuts through the 
center of town and has become the best route between santa cruz and 
san jose while repairs are made to fourlane highway 17 
the light has not exactly been hailed as progress 
everybody wants to tear it down vanderstelt said noting 
that nine cars were waiting for the light to change he added 
this is what i consider a traffic jam 
homes in boulder creek often reflect the areas relative 
isolation with woodfired stoves and propane tanks and wells 
in some cases the quake dirtied wells or dried them up in 
others it forced new springs to spout from the sandstone topsoil 
in still others it rocked houses off their foundations 
on rebecca street high above the town a string of five 
adjacent houses either collapsed or slid precariously toward a 
steep slope neighbors said they hadnt heard from the families who 
lived in them 
anybody whos going to leave already has left said hank 
zumbahlen who lives across the street everybody else has come 
out of the woodwork offering help or keeping notes on whos going 
and whos staying 
his wife cathy said their children have a new game 
now the kids play earthquake our twoyearold runs around the 
house yelling aftershock aftershock she said 
santa cruz county geologists say the temblor loosened hundreds 
of acres of topsoil along the san andreas fault that lines the 
mountain ridge they warned that winters first major rainfall 
could send houses crashing down the steep canyons that slice the 
area 
homeowners were told the county would not issue permits to 
rebuild or repair structures where earthquake fissures exist until 
geological studies are completed they fear they cannot wait that 
long 
residents voted to find a geologist a soil engineer and an 
attorney to deal with the county talks with county officials have 
begun to explore the possibility of allowing residents the 
opportunity to proceed with repairs at their own risk 
this has become the center of the geologic world said 
resident doug henderson geologists from across the states even 
japan have been scrambling around here 
i guess it would be better for them if there is a mudslide 
he said but if it looks like somethings going to happen ill 
take my family and head for a hotel somewhere

authorities shot and killed the 
captured leader of the sinhalese antigovernment uprising monday 
the foreign minister said despite previously guaranteeing his 
safety 
government security officers killed rohana wijeweera founder 
and leader of the sinhalese extremist peoples liberation front at 
his groups colombo headquarters foreign minister ranjan wijeratne 
said 
wijeweera had led soldiers to the headquarters where another 
member of the front fired a revolver at him wijeratne said the 
soldiers opened fire killing wijeweera and the other member hb 
herath 
a political leader considered sympathetic to the peoples 
liberation front warned that wijeweeras death would lead to more 
violence 
the killing if it is true will certainly escalate violence 
in the country because you can kill a man but not an ideology 
said samuel dias bandaranaike leader of the sri lanka progressive 
front 
the people will not believe the governments version of the 
killing of wijeweera he said the killing took place after 
president ranasinghe premadasa repeatedly guaranteed his personal 
safety 
premadasa has made repeated overtures to wijeweera and the front 
to cease violence and open talks with the government but the 
offers have been rejected 
wijeweera and herath were cremated under emergency regulations 
that allow security forces to dispose of bodies without a post 
mortem said wijeratne who is also the deputy defense minister 
premadasa has ordered an inquiry into the shooting he said 
authorities captured wijeweera along with his wife and five 
children sunday in the central district of kandy wijeratne said 
he was brought to colombo where he cooperated with interrogators 
and voluntarily videotaped a speech appealing for peace wijeratne 
said 
the peoples liberation front has been waging a campaign of 
terror and assassination since 1987 in its bid to overthrow the 
sinhalesedominated government the violence has escalated in 
recent months with hundreds of suspected members of the group 
killed by progovernment vigilante groups in revenge attacks 
the government says 6000 people have been killed in the 
confrontation 
the peoples liberation front has attacked the government 
because it claims too many concessions had been given to the tamil 
minority in an effort to halt a separatist insurrection in the 
tamildominated northeast 
sinhalese form 75 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and 
control the government and the military tamils who make up 18 
percent of the population have been fighting for an independent 
nation since 1983 complaining of discrimination in jobs and 
education by the sinhalese the tamil separatist war has claimed at 
least 11000 lives

parliament chose a leading reformer as premier 
today and more than 200000 east germans marched in leipzig to 
demand free elections from a government that already has been 
pressured into granting them free travel 
parliament also for the first time elected a noncommunist as 
its speaker 
the demonstrators gathered in the city that has become the 
focus for protests against the east german leadership demanded the 
communist party abolish its monopoly on power 
west german television newscasts estimated the number of 
protesters at between 200000 and 300000 
the protest came after a weekend in which east germans by the 
millions exercised their new freedom to travel a right granted by 
the government to counter an exodus of emigres to the west 
east berliners today began returning to their jobs after four 
days of frenzied celebrations at the newly opened berlin wall and 
officials said fewer than 1 percent of those who crossed into the 
west during the weekend chose to stay in west germany 
about 100000 east german visitors still headed west today west 
german authorities said the flow of visitors was far slower than 
during the weekend when more than 3 million people made the trip 
in east berlin the parliament convened and elected hans modrow 
a leading reformer to be the new premier he would replace willi 
stoph who resigned along with his 44member cabinet on tuesday 
modrow is a well known reformer within the party which has been 
headed by egon krenz since oct 18 krenz himself has promised some 
reforms including free elections 
earlier parliament elected a noncommunist guenther maleuda 
as its new speaker in an unprecedented secret ballot the ruling 
communist party did not propose a candidate for the post 
maleuda 58 is the chairman of the democratic peasants party 
one of the four small parties that have been allied with the 
communists for 40 years during the political turmoil in recent 
weeks the four parties have been cautiously exploring ways of 
becoming more independent 
also today the partys 163member central committee set dec 15 
for an emergency party congress which would have the power to 
elect an entire new central committee and change party politics 
maleuda was elected to replace horst sindermann a communist 
party official who was sacked from the ruling politburo last week 
and today resigned from his post of parliament president 
maleuda surprisingly defeated manfred gerlach chairman of the 
liberal democratic party who was one of the first politicians to 
call for broad political and economic reforms 
no candidate won a majority on the first ballot in a runoff 
against gerlach maleuda received 246 votes while gerlach got 230 
the parliament has 500 members but only 477 attended the session 
and one abstained 
meanwhile francois mitterrand invited the leaders of the 
european community countries to a special meeting saturday in paris 
to discuss the rapidly changing situation in europe the 
presidential palace announced today in paris 
west berlin began cleaning up the remnants of a celebration that 
began thursday with the opening of east germanys borders and 
finally began winding down sunday night 
federal government officials in bonn said fewer than 1 percent 
of the estimated 3 million east germans who arrived over the 
weekend decided to stay in the west a sign that the new opendoor 
policy would not backfire 
lack of freedom to travel had been one of the major complaints 
of hundreds of thousands of east germans who abandoned their 
communist homeland permanently before the borders opened 
it was something special but anyway things have to go on as 
normal said peter normann an east berliner who visited west 
berlin and then went home 
west berlins bustling kurfuerstendamm the treelined shopping 
thoroughfare that had been jammed with revelers today was filled 
with workers and shoppers 
the carpet of shattered bottles crushed cans fastfood 
wrappers and cigarette packs was swept up and hauled off overnight 
leaving behind few traces of the celebration 
east berlin mayor erhard krack strode through a new breach in 
the 28yearold berlin wall on sunday and shook hands with west 
berlin mayor walter momper the meeting took place at the potsdamer 
platz once the vibrant hub of a united berlin 
momper speaking this morning on nbcs today show said the 
mayors discussed the need for coordination between authorities in 
both sides of the city to handle the increased car and foot traffic 
resulting from the new border policy 
todays announcement on the border areas covers both the 
854mile frontier between east germany and west germany and the 
even more notorious stretch of land running along the berlin wall 
in east berlin the borders had been one of the most closely 
guarded sections of the iron curtain 
in a highly symbolic gesture west german president richard von 
weizsaecker walked into east berlin early today and met with a 
highranking east german army officer on a piece of land forming 
part of the abandoned death strip the officer was not 
immediately identified 
the death strip had already lost much of its significance 
after east germans guards were ordered earlier this year not to 
shoot at wouldbe civilian escapees and after east germans began 
fleeing by way of third countries 
more than 200000 east germans left the country this year the 
exodus combined with weeks of street protests led to leadership 
changes and pledges of democratic reform 
the embattled communist leadership is still struggling to find a 
course that will satisfy growing demands for change while leaving 
the existing party structure in place 
guenter schabowski a member of the ruling politburo and east 
berlins communist party chief said the move to open the borders 
showed that the east german leadership was serious about reforms 
we took the correct and necessary steps in a complicated 
situation and it has helped win back trust the staterun news 
agency adn quoted schabowski as saying

the two main leftist candidates appear 
virtually tied for second place going into presidential elections 
wednesday and the split has raised fears of a conservative victory 
the leftists showed no signs of uniting to challenge the 
conservative favorite in their last meeting at a debate sunday 
night 
we are leagues apart and sometimes i even distrust many 
positions of this citizen leonel brizola a former state 
governor said of his main opponent luis inacio lula da silva 
da silva a congressman and former union leader popularly known 
as lula countered by calling brizola the heir of the getulio 
vargas dictatorship a reference to the populist president and 
dictator who ruled brazil for 20 years between 1930 and 1954 
fernando collor de mello of the conservative national 
reconstruction party is expected to finish in first place 
wednesday but it is doubtful he will win a majority 
if no one wins more than 50 percent of the vote a runoff will 
be held dec 17 between the top two votegetters 
the last public opinion poll indicated collor de mello with 26 
percent support brizola of the centerleft democratic labor party 
with about 14 percent and da silva of the radical left workers 
party with 13 percent 
the only other candidate given a chance of winning the no 2 
spot is sen mario covas of the centerleft brazilian social 
democracy party with 9 percent 
the survey was published saturday in the newspaper o globo and 
was conducted by the brazilian institute of public opinion and 
statistics 
in the debate brizola said da silva 44 was not qualified to 
be president 
we must reflect about the competence and capacity of the 
candidates lula doesnt have experience and will be eating out of 
the hand of others said brizola 67 
da silva responded that competence has little to do with age 
or the number of positions held the capacity of each can be seen 
in the rallies where the people judge our work 
da silva has drawn crowds of hundreds of thousands at campaign 
rallies and enjoys support from all classes and all parts of the 
country 
brizolas support is largely limited to the states of rio de 
janeiro and rio grande do sul where he was governor 
collor de mello 40 a former governor of the tiny northeastern 
state of alagoas has based his campaign on criticizing the current 
president jose sarney 
his attacks on sarney for the 1300 percent annual inflation 
rate and widespread corruption have struck a chord with voters 75 
percent whom earn less than 36 a week 
the election will be brazils first popular presidential 
election since 1960 
brazils last leftist president was joao goulart a vice 
president who took power when janio quadros resigned in 1961 after 
seven months in office goulart was overthrown in a 1964 military 
coup 
the military regime that ruled until 1985 banned direct 
presidential elections sarney a civilian was chosen by an 
electoral college controlled by the outgoing generals

cardinal john oconnor of new york on monday 
opened the first vatican conference on aids by assailing the use of 
condoms and the distribution of syringes to addicts as a means of 
stopping the spread of the disease 
he also urged that aids victims not be treated as outcasts 
perceived only as public health hazards and left to die 
the truth is not in condoms or clean needles oconnor said 
these are lies lies perpetrated often for political reasons on 
the part of public officials by some health care professsionals 
who believe they have nothing else to offer persons with aids or at 
risk lies told by often wellmeaning counselors 
oconnor was the first speaker at the threeday conference 
bringing together more than 1000 delegates from 85 countries 
including church officials scientists theologians and health care 
workers 
robert c gallo director of the laboratory of tumor cell 
biology of the national cancer institute in bethesda md said he 
believes an antiaids vaccine could be available for some patients 
by 1991 or 1992 
and we hope and believe that sooner than is often believed by 
some scientific circles the problem will be solved he said 
the use of condoms in fighting aids has been a delicate issue 
for the roman catholic church which opposes all forms of 
artificial birth control and condemns homosexual activity 
monsignor carlo caffarra an adviser on sexual issues to the 
pope said condom campaigns further expose society to aids because 
the means of protection are far from reliable 
in addition their use encourages individuals to continue 
their highrisk behavior he said citing homosexual activity 
william blattner chief of the viral epidemiological section at 
the national cancer institute agreed that advocating condoms 
promotes risk behavior as does the distribution of syringes for 
drug addicts 
on thursday in baltimore the us bishops conference dropped 
earlier conditional support for condom education in schools and 
urged that aids prevention instead emphasize chastity 
during mondays session at the vatican a man briefly 
interrupted the proceedings when he approached the podium wearing a 
sandwich board with the slogan the church has aids the man 
identified by the ansa news agency as a us priest was led out of 
the hall by security guards 
oconnor said doctors have an obligation to discourage the 
lifestyles that can cause aids pointing out that an estimated 72 
percent of aids victims in the united states contracted the disease 
from homosexual acts and 17 percent from drug use 
the roman catholic church condemns homosexual acts but not 
homosexuals themselves as immoral 
sometimes i believe the greatest damage done to persons with 
aids is done by the dishonesty of those health care professionals 
who refuse to confront the moral dimsensions of sexual aberrations 
or drug abuse oconnor said 
good morality is good medicine he added 
caffarra said married couples should choose abstinence if one of 
the spouses becomes infected with aids he also said doctors have 
the duty to advise one spouse if the other spouse has aids 
with or without the partners permission 
oconnor expressed concern about the attitude toward aids 
victims saying they should receive the same love and treatment of 
any other patients 
he cited the contempt reserved for prisoners with aids noting 
there is more than one horror story of a prisoners being thrown 
into a solitary cell and left to die 
he noted that by 1991 the cost of treating aids victims in new 
york city alone will be 45 million each day 
oconnor said he was worried that the fear of aids could give 
rise to temptations of abortions by pregnant women infected with 
the aids virus 
he also expressed fear that as euthanasia gains acceptance 
around the world aids victims will increasingly seek to kill 
themselves 
jonathan mann director of the world health organizations aids 
program said the agency estimates by the end of the year the 
number of worldwide aids cases will rise to 600000 he said the 
who estimates that 6 million to 8 million people have been infected 
by the virus

if being on the map is any measure of success 36 
small towns across the continent have hit the big time 
mad river calif and pasadena newfoundland are among the 
newest additions to the 1990 rand mcnally road atlas along with 
other newly discovered metropolises and such obscure points of 
interest as wyatt earps birthplace and a house made entirely of 
paper except for the fireplace 
some of the towns added are so small they have no post offices 
or municipal government 
for instance unincorporated oak run consists of 300 homes 
centered around a private lake in the rolling hills of illinois 
knox county 
it was added to the atlas because rand mcnally noticed it was on 
the newest state highway map said michael dobson the companys 
vice president of cartographic services 
the additions of towns as well as rest areas parks and points 
of interest are among 19536 changes in the road atlas 66th 
edition for the united states canada and mexico which goes on 
sale nationwide this week 
the suburban skokiebased mapmaker updates the atlas each year 
deleting things like rest areas that have closed and adding 
strategically located towns to make life easier for traveling 
motorists dobson said in a telephone interview 
getting on the map is an egobooster for east lynne mo a tiny 
farming community that essentially consists of a post office 
grocery store grain elevator school and church 
donna guggisberg postmaster in the town of 286 people southeast 
of kansas city wrote a letter earlier this year to rand mcnally 
complaining that her town felt left out 
i was just pointing out that it wasnt on the map and that 
wed like an answer she said in a telephone interview 
rand mcnally responded with a letter saying that it was an 
oversight and that they would put it on the map mrs guggisberg 
said 
the little farming communities are having a struggle and i 
think for morale purposes it is an uplift she said 
in oak run the new atlas is welcomed by realtor jerrie rudd 
whos trying to drum up interest and business in the area 
people are interested in oak run but they cant ever find 
it on the map she said 
but not everyone thinks being added to the atlas is good news 
merchants at the grocery store burger bar and lodge in the 
northern california hamlet of mad river might like the idea but 
some residents would rather keep their serene little town a secret 
people who live up here dont like the idea that tourists are 
coming up here said bernadette madonia purchasing agent for the 
mad river ranger district in six rivers national forest 
in fact when they repaired the roads people had a fit 
dobson said company researchers discovered mad river and 
decided to add it to the atlas because of its location in a 
recreational area 
other touristoriented additions include 
the paper house in pigeon cove mass built by a couple who 
planned to live there but moved elsewhere when it became an instant 
hit 
a barbed wire museum in lacrosse kan 
the monmouth ill birthplace of legendary frontiersman wyatt 
earp 
though debate still continues as to which house earp was born 
in the town itself is his confirmed birthplace rand mcnally 
says

consumer activist ralph nader and the 
president of common cause disagreed monday on whether congress 
should take a proposed 33 percent pay hike with nader saying hell 
enlist talkshow hosts in his bid to kill the raise 
nader who early this year successfully fought a proposed 51 
percent pay hike told reporters that congress was at it again 
despite widespread public opposition to the earlier proposal 
he said about 600 radio talkshow hosts would be contacted to 
stir up opposition to the pay plan before leaders of the house can 
bring it to a vote perhaps late this week the earlier raise 
proposal was a favorite topic on talk shows 
the new pay plan is more modest with a 77 percent pay raise in 
january and a 25 percent increase in january 1991 the raises would 
apply to members of congress who are paid 89500 and to top 
executive branch officials and federal judges 
the package was developed by a house bipartisan task force 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine said that a 
majority of senators oppose the house plan and that the senate 
would consider accepting only the 77 percent january raise as a 
costofliving adjustment 
congressional salaries were last increased in 1987 when 
members pay was raised from 77400 
the new increases would be tied to congressional ethics reforms 
including an end to members padding their incomes by making 
speeches to interest groups 
nader told a news conference he supported reform of 
congressional ethics rules but that should be done regardless of 
the pay raise 
i dont think people in this country like the idea of congress 
telling them that they will reform themselves only if they get a 
pay increase nader said that smells bad 
but fred wertheimer president of common cause said lawmakers 
were entitled to a pay increase if they give up their other sources 
of income as would be required by the ethics reforms 
members of congress should only be working for one employer 
the citizens of this country said wertheimer whose organization 
lobbies for more stringent ethics rules 
wertheimer said he expected public opposition to the raise 
people dont like them as a general proposition 
my view is that it is very important now for the congress to 
look at the longterm consequences and not the momentary 
reaction he said 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash defended the plan but 
declined to discuss details with reporters 
foley said the plan would be ready for unveiling wednesday and 
house leaders had no intention of trying to sneak anything past 
them 
as usual mr nader is wrong foley said it wont be 
coming up in the dead of night snuck through without a vote

everyones heard of brooklyn ny 
practically no ones heard of this brooklyn which consists of a 
school and a tavern and the tavern is closed 
but brooklyn wash is having its day in the sun even if its 
only because of name familiarity 
the tiny town in the willapa hills of southwest washington is 
featured in a television commercial for burgerville usa 
also featured is bob tomisser superintendent of north river 
school 
in brooklyn new york you are conveniently located near wall 
street yankee stadium and coney island big deal tomisser tells 
the camera as he strolls out of the small school 
youre also about 3000 miles from one of these he says 
holding up a large burger promoted in the 30second spot 
then the camera pans back to tomisser 
burgerville usa inconveniently located across the united 
states he says of the 31restaurant chain in the northwest 
the commercial airs in washington and oregon and tomisser is 
receiving royalties each time its shown altogether his one days 
work should bring in about 1500 
incidentally you cant get a burgerville burger here either 
the nearest burgerville is nearly 100 miles away in centralia 
the ad campaign for burgerville plays off small towns that have 
bigcity counterparts

thirdgrader jessica plank receives mail almost 
daily from people she has never met in winstonsalem nc 
last friday was no exception a correspondent sent a guidebook 
and told her how the citys 300yearold trees were destroyed by 
hurricane hugo 
her fellow pupils get mail from other parts of the united states 
in what has become a prodigious social studies project in the 
thirdgrade class of julia shanabrook at norman a trimmer 
elementary school in the west york area school district 
there are wonderful people in america who care enough about 
strangers to go out buy postcards sit down and write to us 
said mrs shanabrook 31 who has just begun teaching after 
graduating from college 
each of the class 25 students wrote to a newspaper editor in 
two states requesting help in asking readers to send postcards and 
share what makes their community special 
on friday mrs shanabrook distributed a 6inch stack of mail 
among the eager students i get folders i get boxes i get 
10by13inch envelopes filled 
the mail helps the children learn about current events as well 
as geography she said 
while the class has decided that winstonsalem is probably the 
most friendly town in the united states mrs shanabrook said 
students had heard from people in 24 states 
the children giggled at an idaho postcard a picture of a single 
huge potato consuming the bed of a flatbed trailer 
but kushal shah saw through the ruse 
its a regular potato he said they put it on a little 
truck 
twice one day last week students heard that michigan is shaped 
like a mitten one person sent a footlong mittenshaped map 
another wrote she lives in the thumb 
mrs shanabrook said a new jersey television station producer 
called about doing a story on what morristown residents think is 
special about their home she told the producer they like general 
washingtons headquarters

police were worried that a package left on 
the steps of the university of utahs museum of natural history 
might contain a bomb but an xray revealed the bones of a 
1000yearold mummy 
authorities say the remains packed into a sears television box 
likely belong to member of the ancient anasazi indian tribe 
anthropologists and pathologists say the rare find is among the 
best preserved they have seen 
law enforcement officials believe looters carried the mummy from 
its burial cave in the desert southwest where the anasazi or 
ancient ones farmed and hunted from about 600 ad until 1350 
ad 
anthropologists say they are the ancestors of the hopi and 
pueblo indians of today 
second thoughts and stiff penalties for pilfering indian 
artifacts on federal or indian lands probably led the anonymous 
finders to donate the remains to the museum university of utah 
police chief wayne shepherd said 
museum officials said they intended to give up the remains for 
reburial authorities have contacted state and federal indian 
agencies but no decision has been made on where or how the remains 
will be reburied 
indian tribes strongly oppose allowing such remains to be 
displayed in museums believing it to be sacrilege pressure from 
indian groups recently prompted the smithsonian institution in 
washington to agree to return its indian remains to tribes for 
reburial 
shepherd said a university of utah museum secretary received an 
anonymous telephone call oct 11 from a woman who said her husband 
had found a mummy knew having it was illegal and wondered whether 
the museum wanted it the caller told the employee to look on the 
back steps and hung up shepherd said 
police were called and as a cautionary measure took xrays of 
the box to ensure that it didnt contain a bomb instead the 
xrays showed vague outlines of a human skeleton 
utah state medical examiner dr todd grey said he found the 
mummy in remarkable shape given its apparent age 
its a very rare find added university of utah 
anthropologist john mccullough we have very few specimens of 
that time period available 
the professor said much valuable data was lost however because 
the burial site is unknown 
its unfortunate from two aspects foremost is that a burial 
was disturbed in a most unceremonious way its desecration he 
said second is that from an archaeological standpoint whatever 
information we could have gleaned has been largely lost 
thousands of ancient indian dwellings scattered throughout the 
southwestern united states attract artifact hunters looting and 
damage to potentially significant archaeological sites has led to 
laws prohibiting scavenging on federal lands 
the mummy was folded into a fetal position and covered with a 
woven robe feathers or tufts of rabbit fur covered the lower 
extremities the skull apparently severed during excavation was 
nestled in polystryrene packing material between the feet 
the torso and legs were covered with a brown parchmentlike 
skin fingernails and toenails were still evident 
we dont see mummified remains that often grey said i 
see homicide victims who have been dead for two or three years and 
theyre bones 
this is a really nice example of what can happen to human 
remains in a dry warm and protected environment he added 
that state of preservation has allowed grey and mccullough to 
draw a few conclusions about the mummy which is believed to be 
that of a woman in her 60s 
while the exact age of the remains isnt known mccullough 
estimates it falls somewhere between 800 ad and 1200 ad 
the flattened back of the head suggests the remains are american 
indian since indians often strapped their infants to flat cradle 
boards the size and shape of the skull and small size of the 
skeleton indicate the mummy is probably female while compressed 
vertebrae offer clues to her age

climbing out of bed in the middle of the 
night can be a risky moment for the heart but shoveling snow 
may not be as dangerous as people have long believed according to 
two studies released monday 
in one of the studies researchers monitored the hearts of 
people with coronary artery disease while they slept if they had 
to get out of bed in the night their hearts often experienced 
potentially harmful periods of ischemia a temporary shortage of 
blood 
it seems that jumping out of bed and running around to do 
something is a risky moment that we should think about said dr 
andrew p selwyn of brigham and womens hospital in boston 
on the other hand researchers at the medical college of 
wisconsin found that for active physically fit people with heart 
disease shoveling snow is probably no riskier than other moderate 
exercise 
the feeling over the years has been that we should baby these 
people said sara m dougherty an exercise physiologist who 
conducted the study we want to get away from that shoveling is 
not for everyone but to say no one can shovel is just as much an 
error 
however she cautioned that people with heart trouble should not 
shovel unless they have taken a treadmill test and consulted their 
doctor 
both studies were presented monday at the annual scientific 
meeting of the american heart association an estimated 28000 
people gathered in new orleans to hear about 2700 research reports 
on heart disease 
many studies in recent years have attempted to pinpoint 
activities that are especially risky for people with bad hearts 
looking for instances in which the hearts own muscle fails to get 
enough blood sometimes this deprivation causes chest pain called 
angina but usually it is entirely painless 
researchers have found that mental stress can be an especially 
powerful trigger of ischemia in those with underlying heart 
disease for instance being asked to do simple math problems or to 
give a public talk can raise the hearts demand for blood or lower 
its supply resulting in oxygen deprivation 
in the boston study directed by joan barry 30 people with 
heart disease wore heart monitors while they slept twentyone of 
them got up at night usually to go to the bathroom a total of 36 
times on 24 of these occasions their hearts showed signs of 
painless ischemia 
selwyn theorizes that the blood vessels may be slow to adapt to 
the hearts changing demands when people stand up after lying down 
earlier studies have shown similar ischemic episodes when people 
climb out of bed in the morning 
selwyn said it may be possible to control these activities 
effects on the heart with drugs such as beta blockers that fight 
ischemia 
in the shoveling study researchers examined 14 men in their 60s 
who had heart disease each was asked to shovel gravel for half an 
hour at a temperature of 18 degrees each shovelful weighed about 
12 pounds 
the men had taken treadmill stress tests to measure their 
maximum heart rates and oxygen consumption while shoveling they 
reached 75 percent of their top heart rate and 63 percent of their 
maximum oxygen consumption none showed signs of ischemia 
shoveling was a safe activity for them said dougherty it 
was well within the guidelines we would give them for any other 
activity 
she emphasized that while the men had suffered uncomplicated 
heart attacks or had coronary artery disease they were physically 
fit and active none ordinarily suffered chest pain triggered by 
cold weather alone 
she said that while there has been anecdotal evidence linking 
snow shoveling with fatal heart attacks her study appears to be 
the first to actually examine this with heart patients 
what we are looking at is getting away from the cardiac 
cripple myth dougherty said

scientists explaining the extent of 
damage caused by ships that recently ran aground on coral reefs in 
the florida keys can point to a reef hit by another ship five years 
ago that still bears obvious scars 
it can take 100 years for coral a hard shelter built up by 
millions of tiny animals to grow one yard 
we tend to think in human life spans but coral reef life 
spans are measured in the hundreds of years said alina szmant a 
coral reef specialist at the university of miami 
both humans and nature are putting pressure on the florida 
barrier reef a tract of about 6000 reefs extending from miami 
south along the florida keys to the dry tortugas west of key west 
this is the thirdlongest barrier reef in the world and its 
got more tourism than any other reef said lynn davidson marine 
habitat coordinator for greenpeace international we believe that 
the coral is acting a bit like a canary in a coal mine we know 
they are very fragile and they do respond very rapidly to stress 
the florida reefs are smaller than only australias great 
barrier reef and the caribbean reefs off belize 
new attention was drawn to the reefs by three ship groundings in 
less than a month 
on oct 25 the 155foot freighter alec owen matiland cut a 
200foot swath through a reef in the key largo national marine 
sanctuary five days later the 475foot phosphate hauler mavro 
vetranic scraped two to three acres of ocean bottom in the dry 
tortugas in the far western keys 
on saturday a 470foot cargo ship the elpis was refloated off 
a reef east of key largo after nearly 16 hours aground damage 
there was still being assessed 
in 1984 in the worst grounding of the decade the ship wellwood 
scarred 128000 square feet of coral on the marine sanctuarys 
molasses reef even though sponges are moving in and coral larvae 
are settling down the damage is still readily apparent said 
sanctuary biologist john halas 
there has not been very much new coral showing up in that 
area said ms szmant who studies coral reef physiology in the 
florida keys and caribbean 
but the human intrusion on the reefs home of 52 coral species 
and 10 times as many fish extends well beyond the damage caused 
by ships running aground 
other ways in which man can impact the reefs are anchor damage 
and divers kicking and breaking coral standing on the coral ms 
szmant said a lot of the boat traffic stirs up a lot of 
sediments which is bad for the coral weve seen a lot of damage 
done to the reef by just small boats 
coral needs clear water that ranges in temperature from 68 to 86 
degrees 
they are in a fragile location to begin with theyre on the 
northern edge of where coral grows said larry fooks assistant 
manager of john pennekamp coral reef state park which receives 
about 15 million visitors by boat each year theyre right at 
the point where if the temperature drops too much and all the 
conditions turn sour they could go too 
dredging for construction clouds the water fresh water runoff 
from the keys spoils the saline balance and sewage and possibly 
farm runoff from the florida mainland carry unwanted nutrients to 
the reefs in addition coral diseases that some scientists believe 
are caused or influenced by man also have appeared in the last 
three years 
a variety of measures have been proposed to protect the coral 
including quotas on visitors expanded sanctuaries and a shipping 
buffer zone 
we definitely need a good management plan to protect those 
reef resources said manley fuller president of the florida 
wildlife federation the 10000member state affiliate of the 
national wildlife federation 
its important for the public to be able to see experience 
and enjoy nature thats the future of conservation he said 
but we must guard against a situation of loving what we love to 
death and thats a real potential

began saturday and the sound of mortars and gunfire still echoed 
through san salvadors deserted streets early today 
us embassy spokesman barry jacobs said army troops had been 
ordered to avoid civilian casualties and that was slowing the 
counteroffensive

his party has been linked to death squads that operated with 
near impunity in the wars early years and are blamed for most of 
its 70000 deaths 
the rebel farabundo marti liberation front in a radio 
broadcast tied the offensive to the oct 31 bombing of the 
national federation of salvadoran workers union hall in the 
capital that attack killed 10 people and wounded more than 30 and 
the rebels blamed it on the government 
rebel leaders on wednesday pulled out of a third round of peace

a judge with learning disabilities said monday 
more government funding is needed for juvenile criminals who have 
reading troubles 
if you cant read there are only two ways to earn a living 
welfare and crime judge jeffery gallet of new york said and 
the truth is crime pays more and has higher status in their 
communities 
gallet was a speaker at the first learning handicapped offender 
conference about 250 educators and corrections officials from 
around the country are attending the meeting which runs through 
wednesday 
james keeley conference chairman and a correction education 
specialist with the pennsylvania department of education said the 
gathering is needed to share successful programs and policies 
an estimated 20 percent to 40 percent of jailed juveniles and 
adults have learning disabilities said stephen j steurer 
executive director of the correctional education association in 
laurel md the disabilities include any difficulties with math or 
written language not caused by emotional or social malajustment in 
a person of average or better intelligence 
steurer said federal state and local governments have little 
interest in funding special education programs for convicts 
nobody wants to do anything with people who get in trouble with 
the law except lock them up he said 
gallet 47 a new york state family court judge said he has 
trouble spelling following a line of type distinguishing left 
from right and doing math in his head he was 32 when he found out 
learning disabilities were at the root of his struggles in school 
causing him to graduate last in his college class he now 
compensates by using an index card to read a calculator to add a 
watch to tell his right hand from his left and spellcheck computer 
software 
teenagers with learning disabilities often become frustrated 
and drop out of school gallet said 
we know what happens to the girls they become pregnant 
and what happens to the boys they turn to crime he said you 
dont have to know how to read to carry a pound of cocaine from the 
port authority in new york to virginia in a little knapsack 
by not paying the little bit now we pay forever gallet 
said we pay because they steal from us we pay because we have 
higher insurance rates we pay because we pay for their welfare we 
pay because we pay when they go into the adult criminal system 
gallet pointed to a program run by the bronx district attorneys 
office as a model for young offenders with learning disabilities 
under the program firsttime offenders 16 to 21 who are 
learning disabled can receive special education at the opportunity 
center which is run by the albert einstein college of medicine 
thomas olin director of the educational outreach program in the 
bronx district attorneys office said the 2yearold opportunity 
center appeared to lower the rate of rearrest of these offenders 
from 50 percent to 25 percent 
the bronx district attorneys office spends 400000 a year to 
serve 100 young offenders who qualify for the opportunity center 
olin said

long known as an antiestablishment communist 
politician patiently awaiting his chance new east german premier 
hans modrow is a symbol of hope for wideranging political and 
economic reforms 
an engineer by trade and holder of a university economics 
degree the former communist party chief in dresden is expected to 
have much more clout as head of the cabinet than his colorless 
predecessor willi stoph 
the east german economy is a shambles says guenther buch a 
federal government researcher in berlin who watches east germany 
it will be the strategy of the party to allow a shift of power 
toward the council of ministers cabinet to lighten the burden of 
the economic disaster for the party he said the main 
responsibility in coming weeks will be with hans modrow 
analysts see modrow 61 as east germanys equivalent to soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev whose domestic program of greater 
openness and economic restructuring caught on among the east german 
public and was the main trigger of the convulsions sweeping the 
country in recent weeks 
many east germans as well as soviet officials made plain they 
would have preferred modrow in the post of east germanys top 
leader 
modrow has a reputation as a smart and modest communist who 
rejects hardline policies new communist party leader egon krenz 
remains associated with those policies despite ceding to pressure 
for change 
before the party announced his nomination as premier wednesday 
east berlins party bosses appeared intent to keep him at arms 
length in dresden where he became party secretary in 1973 
but he was never known to complain stayed true to his 
principles and became exceptionally popular in his district 115 
miles south of berlin 
in june central authorities singled him out for rare public 
criticism saying he failed to control bourgeois and enemy 
views in dresden after a large demonstration of citizens 
demanding free travel to the west 
married and the father of two children modrow began his party 
career as chief of the communist youth organization in east berlin 
in 195361 he won election to the central committee in 1967 and 
later held a propaganda post 
he was once considered a protege and possible successor of 
former leader erich honecker but the prerequisite a politburo 
post eluded him until last week 
like gorbachev modrow has made clear he thinks a policy of 
suppressing problems is counterproductive 
buch said the shape and speed of reform depends on the cabinet 
modrow names and on how much power the reformers will have on a 
revamped central committee expected to emerge from an extraordinary 
meeting next month 
for now modrows appointment seems to be a signal from the 
politburo aimed at pacifying the broad masses buch said we 
must await the personnel and economic decisions in the next few 
days

a draft law lifting most travel restrictions on 
soviets passed its first legislative hurdle monday and could 
eventually unleash a flood of a half a million emigrants tass 
reported 
the proposed law is revolutionary for soviet society and 
considered by many to be nearly as radical as east germanys recent 
liberalization of its exit rules the official news agency said 
the bill allows emigration for virtually anyone who has entry 
permission from another country and no outstanding alimony 
obligations criminal charges or recent knowledge of state secrets 
it sets a basic limit of five years on the length of time a 
citizen can be kept from emigrating because of access to secrets 
the bill which was given preliminary approval by the supreme 
soviet legislature monday formalizes many changes that have 
already been put into practice in soviet emigration and travel 
policy the procedures required to obtain travel documents and 
permission to emigrate have already been eased tremendously in the 
last two years releasing a flood of visitors and emigrants across 
the soviet borders 
soviet officials estimate 200000 soviets will have emigrated 
this year and well over 2 million will have made visits abroad 
most of the emigrants go to the united states or west germany 
deputy fyodor burlatsky told the supreme soviet that current 
predictions hold the new law will allow more than 500000 people to 
emigrate and up to 8 million people will go abroad for visits next 
year tass said 
the officials acknowledge the main obstacles to travel have 
become the heavy workloads of emigration authorities shortages of 
plane and train tickets and problems with currency exchange 
supreme soviet deputies said the visaissuing agencies should be 
expanded and more flights should be added tass reported 
the problem of where the financially strapped country will find 
hard currency to give its citizens to spend abroad will be more 
difficult to resolve the news agency added 
the rubles earned by soviet citizens are nonconvertible they 
are generally not allowed across the borders and spurned in the 
west 
before the current liberalization of travel regulations tens of 
thousands of jews and other soviets were refused exit visas 
becoming known as refuseniks their plight brought repeated 
censure from the west 
with less than 1 percent of applications to emigrate currently 
being turned down according to visa officials few refuseniks 
remain the government says they are all held on the grounds that 
they had some access to secrets but activists complain the secrecy 
criteria are abused and applied arbitrarily

hundreds of university of massachusetts 
students put down their books and picked up placards monday to 
boycott classes in a protest of state budget cuts that are forcing 
fee increases 
the state of massachusetts must not be allowed to let the 
younger generation pay for the mistakes of the present 
generation said lisa nelson a junior from sunderland and a 
boycott organizer 
the mood on campus was festive as picket lines snaked around 
buildings and people carrying banners marched through the student 
union nearly 2000 of the campus 25000 students gathered on the 
steps of the student center to hear speakers at an afternoon rally 
calling for raising taxes not cutting education 
you need to convince your representatives and senators that 
you are a force to be reckoned with that you will support them if 
they support you said history professor bruce laurie vice 
president of the faculty union 
organizers said the length of the protest depended on enthusiasm 
and participation by students at the universitys boston campus and 
at other state schools 
the boycott protested a 25 million cut in public higher 
education brought on by massachusetts fiscal crisis the amherst 
campus share of the cutback is 64 million and follows a 5 
percent slash ordered in july said paul j page vice chancellor 
for finance and administration 
laurie said an informal census among his colleagues indicated 60 
percent of mondays classes were canceled because of the boycott 
university spokesmen said they were still trying to determine the 
extent of the boycott by early afternoon but some classes were 
being held 
chancellor joseph duffey who was out of town monday said 
earlier that the administration would not endorse a student strike 
although he was sympathetic to their feelings 
deirdre ling vice chancellor for university relations and 
development said it was too soon to say if action would be taken 
against striking students 
at thompson hall where four auditoriums normally are packed 
with 200 and 300 students only about two dozen students sat in 
each room said john cole president of the faculty union 
the union was not actively involved in the strike but it had 
sent the students a letter of support 
on thursday university trustees authorized boosting a special 
student curriculum fee by up to 350 next semester in response to 
the proposed cuts 
the boost would raise the 165 fee at the amherst campus to 515 
and bring the universitys total mandatory fees to 1465 tuition 
which was raised 8 percent this fall is 1512 
theyre raising the cost so much that theyre cutting out the 
poor people said jim pak a junior from fairfax va

the white house suggested monday that abortion 
will not be a deciding factor in next years elections and said 
that divergent views were a matter of principle not an issue 
of politics 
a conciliatory marlin fitzwater the presidents spokesman also 
voiced belated recognition to sundays abortionrights rallies in 
washington and around the country 
we certainly approve of the rally and are glad that theyve 
participants exercised their right to speak out fitzwater said 
of the washington gathering which drew a crowd estimated at 
150000 
fitzwaters comments came in the aftermath of last weeks 
elections in which republican candidates who share bushs 
antiabortion views were defeated by prochoice democrats 
but fitzwater suggested that in spite of weeks of tough 
antiabortion talk and two vetoes of abortionfinancing 
legislation bush has no quarrel with those who support abortion 
rights 
sundays rally in the capital was expressing the views of a 
lot of people who feel very strongly and very deeply about that 
subject fitzwater said abortion is an issue that people feel 
strongly about on both sides its a matter of principle 
bush favors an antiabortion amendment to the constitution he 
vetoed two spending bills that would have expanded medicaid 
coverage to pay for abortions for poor women in cases of rape or 
incest the present law permits the use of federal funds for 
abortions only when the mothers life is in danger 
fitzwater who recently said that bush would not hire anyone in 
a policymaking position who did not share his views on abortion 
told reporters monday 
its our belief that people should take a position on this 
issue according to their strong moral and religious and personal 
beliefs and that should be the deciding factor not politics 
at a news conference tuesday bush said that both the democratic 
and republican parties are broad enough to contain differing 
views on this 
still in an interview in dallas on saturday with texas 
reporters bush complained that the proabortion people want 
dealers choice on abortion and they think that they see a wind of 
change that will help their cause 
asked about polls suggesting prochoice positions helped 
democratic gubernatorial candidates in new jersey and virginia last 
week and in the new york mayors race fitzwater said we think 
there were a lot of issues 
any number of factors resulted in the victories and the losses 
for the particular candidates there abortion was an important 
issue but people dont decide elections on one issue he 
said 
asked if the white house shared a concern of some gop 
strategists that the abortion issue could hurt gop candidates in 
1990 fitzwater replied no 
fitzwaters comments came as abortionrights activists were 
pledging to channel their energy from last weeks election 
victories into 1990 political campaigns 
bushs own position on abortion has had a number of twists and 
turns for instance in his 1980 presidential campaign he said he 
supported the 1973 roe vs wade supreme court decision legalizing 
abortion 
more recently however he has called for a constitutional 
amendment banning abortion except to protect the mothers life or 
in cases of incest or rape 
his position differs on the question of using federal funds to 
pay for abortions for poor women there he favors using tax dollars 
for the procedure only when the womans life is in danger and not 
in cases of rape or incest 
and although he initially suggested he was flexible on the 
point of federal funds he later abandoned an effort to reach a 
compromise with congress and vetoed two spending bills over 
provisions expanding medicaidfinanced abortions to cases of rape 
and incest

astronauts cosmonauts and 
scientists from around the world urged their nations monday to 
develop a way to rescue people who become lost in space 
the association of space explorers whose members include space 
travelers and scientists from the united states and the soviet 
union said a universal method of retrieving stranded astronauts is 
crucial 
since search and rescue is a humanitarian effort it should 
not be difficult to achieve cooperation among national and 
international organizations us astronaut vincent white 
told the congress 
fiftyfive members from 14 countries held the groups 5th annual 
conference in riyadh to discuss ways to harness space technology 
for peaceful purposes 
the congress noted the growing number of space flights and has 
been examining various ways to set up a space rescue system 
the frequency and numbers of people traveling in space has 
increased dramatically in the last three decades the congress 
said consequently the likelihood of emergency situations 
requiring a rescue effort has also increased 
soviet cosmonaut alexander alexandrov told the congress that 
nations must pool their resources to develop such a system 
it is practically impossible for any nation to go it alone as 
far as rescue in space is concerned he said efforts of all 
spacefaring powers must be united to attain this goal and avoid 
loss of human lives in space 
the association which has 72 members representing 17 nations 
was preparing proposals to govern the proposed space rescue system 
us astronaut johndavid bartoe suggested a worldwide 
communications network ensuring contact with any point on the 
earths surface airspace and near space methods must be 
developed to make possible the search for and immediate evacuation 
of persons involved in accidents of extending first aid 
us astronauts and soviet cosmonauts agreed on the necessity of 
getting their governments to accept the idea of setting up an 
integrated space rescue system 
soviet participants also told reporters that moscow was ready 
and eager to carry out a joint ussoviet flight to mars 
alexei leonov chairman of the soviet wing of the association 
said a joint flight to mars would be less costly 
indian space scientist yash pal warned nuclear powers against 
dumping toxic and nuclear waste in space he said using space for 
military purposes would lead to the end of the world 
the host for the meeting is prince sultan bin salman the first 
astronaut from an arab country salman a major in the royal saudi 
air force flew on the us space shuttle discovery in 1985

west german chancellor helmut kohl told 
polish lawmakers monday a unified germany would be important and 
precious for poland 
kohl met with about 80 members of the sejm or parliament and 
the solidaritydominated senate for more than two hours his 
spokesman hans klein said about twice the number of lawmakers 
than expected showed up for the meeting 
senate marshal andrzej stelmachowski a constitutional lawyer 
and solidarity adviser said after the meeting he was satisfied 
with the talks 
stelmachowski said kohl told the polish lawmakers the process of 
democratization must be combined with the unification of all of 
europe 
in general he kohl thinks that the process of reunification 
would be a process connected with the general process of 
unification of europe and the 21st century would not be a time of 
national states stelmachowski said 
he said kohl had stressed that for poland a germany integrated 
with europe would be important and precious and outlined a 
general concept in which freedom would be more important than 
borders 
west germany has pledged in a 1970 treaty to respect the oder 
and neisse rivers as polands western borders but a reunified 
germany is not committed to those terms 
west german conservatives recently suggested reunification be 
sought within the 1937 borders of the reich which included about 
onethird of presentday poland those statements have aroused 
concern in poland 
kohl told his audience more than 80 percent of those west 
germans who were asked said thay favored respecting the oder and 
neisse rivers as polands western borders the senator said 
klein said the chancellor also talked about economic aid easing 
polish fears that increased west german financial help for east 
germany might force reductions in the level of aid for poland 
the spokesman assured the poles that was not the case 
especially since kohl was aware that without the prior events in 
poland and hungary reform in east germany would not have been 
possible 
the solidarityled government believes western aid is essential 
for poland to make the transition to a market economy and secure 
democratic reforms 
klein had said sunday night after kohl met president wojciech 
jaruzelski and prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki that more west 
german aid would have to be concentrated on east germany 
kohl had broken off his visit to poland on friday so he could 
attend an emergency cabinet session in bonn on the events in east 
germany 
stelmachowski said kohl stressed he had returned to poland to 
give a sign that his country planned to continue the policy being 
implemented before east germany opened its borders 
kohl said nothing should be changed in that policy according to 
the senator last week both sides signed agreements worth 15 
billion in economic assistance 
earlier monday kohl traveled to the southeastern city of 
lublin where he was awarded an honorary degree he said that he 
realized reunification which would result in a nation of 80 
million people concerned not only germans but their neighbors as 
well 
today a new departure is announcing itself in the german 
democratic republic how could it be otherwise at a moment when the 
wind of liberty unfolding on europe he said 
kohl thanked poles who have come out in favor of reunification 
as a way of overcoming totalitarianism 
he appeared to be referring to adam michnik a solidarity deputy 
and editor of the prosolidarity daily gazeta wyborcza and 
bronislaw geremek solidarity parliamentary leader 
the two historians have said a destalinized east germany would 
be beneficial for poland 
kohl said he was moved and profoundly grateful to see that 
prominent poles are among the first to demand naturally liberty and 
the right to selfdetermination for east germany i would like to 
thank them for such a frank engagement and courage in favor of 
liberty 
but kohl added that he realized the future of the two germanys 
does not leave any one of our neighbors indifferent and said 
the german national destiny lies within europe as a whole

crisis that they say could result in america becoming a secondrate 
nation 
a report to be released later this week by the american 
association of state colleges and universities proposed that half 
of the increase in science education be used to upgrade 
undergraduate science instruction 
america will be a secondrate nation said the president of 
florida aampm university frederick a humphries he pointed to 
predictions that there will be a shortage of 700000 science and 
technology professionals by 2000 
science education he says is in crisis 
we have to start channeling more of our resources into 
programs improving undergraduate science education and offer more 
support to college instructors committed to teaching science to 
college and university students said association president allan 
ostar 
humphries chairman of the associations committee on science 
and technology and other committee members said the report will be 
released at the groups annual meeting in san francisco 
the report partly funded by the national science foundation 
predicted that channeling funds to undergraduate science education 
has the potential to be the catalyst for reforming the total 
science education pipeline of the nation 
we must raise the quality of science education at every level 
expand participation in science by all students and encourage more 
students to choose careers in engineering science and science 
teaching and to do all that we need more money ostar said 
the report formula for reform the role of the comprehensive 
university in undergraduate science and engineering education 
offered three recommendations 
double the national science foundation budget within the next 
five years bringing it to about 36 billion 
divide all new appropriations for the foundation equally 
between science and engineering education and research and related 
activities 
develop a broad geographical base for the nations research and 
science education activities 
the report noted that president bush has proposed that the 
budget for the national science foundation be doubled and while 
enabling legislation has been passed by congress and signed into 
law the actual appropriations have not been approved the 
universities pledged to work for the money

the mood is getting a little bit too militant for me said 
party member uwe dreilich 32 he said he had been present at all 
the leipzig demonstrations in the past two months 
i am for free elections but i think we must be careful that 
this does not get out of control he said 
witnesses estimated the crowd at nearly 300000 people 
the demonstration was the seventh in as many weeks in leipzig 
but the crowd was smaller than the up to 500000 who have turned 
out previously 
before the march leipzig leaders of east germanys biggest 
opposition group new forum hailed east germans new freedom to 
travel but insisted there be free elections and other moves toward 
genuine democracy

the energy department on monday announced that 
refrigerators and freezers built after 1992 will have to use 25 
percent less energy than todays models 
the efficiency gain will save consumers nearly 20 a year in 
electricity costs the department said 
the decision drew quick criticism from the appliance industry 
which contends the technology to meet the new standards does not 
exist and is not likely to by 1993 
shellshocked thats how we react said frederick hallett 
vice president of white consolidated industries maker of philco 
and other refrigerator brands 
this is akin to telling the automobile industry it has to have 
a mileage standard of 50 miles a gallon hallett said adding 
that the tougher requirements will force some refrigerators and 
freezer off the market by 1993 
henson moore the deputy energy secretary said in announcing 
the new standards that the department considered five possible 
efficiency standards and chose a midpoint option that strikes a 
reasonable balance between what is technologically feasible and 
economically justified 
the new standards effective jan 1 1993 will raise the retail 
price of refrigerators and freezers by an average 105 percent but 
the extra cost will be offset in less than 2 years by savings from 
a lower cost of running the appliances moore said 
for the most common model of refrigerator those with 
topmounted freezers and automatic defrost comprising 70 percent 
of the market the average retail price will rise from an 
estimated 513 for the basic 1990 model to 559 for the equivalent 
1993 model moore said 
however he said it will take nearly 20 a year less in 
electricity to run the appliance which is the largest user of 
electricity in many american households 
the reduced power requirements will save the nation the 
equivalent of 5000 megawatts of generating capacity or the output 
of four large power plants between 1993 and 2015 assuming the 
efficiency standard remains constant over that period moore said 
the department is also considering new energy efficiency 
standards for television sets and 11 other types of household 
appliances as required by a 1987 law

the federal fund that pays for the nations 
presidential campaigns is still suffering from declining income 
threatening public financing of the quadrennial battle for the 
white house the chairman of the federal election commission says 
fec chairman danny lee mcdonald wrote members of congress 
earlier this month to say that fewer and fewer americans are 
checking the box on their tax returns to send 1 to the campaign 
fund 
through august of this year mcdonald said only 311 million 
had been deposited in the fund from checkoffs on 1988 tax returns 
if the trend holds he said the fund will receive less this year 
than the 33 million pumped in last year 
the balance of the fund has shrunk dramatically due to the 
inflationary pressures on the payouts to candidates mcdonald 
said in his letter if the trend continues by the end of the 
1996 presidential campaign the balance will be in a negative 
position 
the payments to presidential campaigns are increased by 
inflation in each election cycle whether or not the funds income 
has increased the fec pointed out this trend to congress earlier 
this year and asked congress to look for ways to remedy the 
situation 
the money from the checkoff is used to match individual 
contributions to presidential candidates primary campaigns and to 
pay the entire cost of the general election presidential race for 
the two major party candidates 
primary candidates who raise a certain minimum amount of money 
can apply for federal funds to match dollarfordollar the amounts 
of individual contributions of 250 or less since overall primary 
spending is capped there is also a limit to the amount that can be 
matched 
in the general elections major party candidates can accept no 
private contributions and must rely completely on federal funds

east germanys unexpected opening of its western borders has 
sparked debate over the possible reunification of the two germanys 
and its potential impact on western alliances

era of reduced eastwest tensions

nations to move ahead with their plans for closer ties 
eyskens who is chairman of the group said it was in the 
interest of all that the east has in front of it a solid partner 
steady credible with sufficient economic capacity to help it

european community leaders in strasbourg france should give a 
signal to the east of a willingness to cooperate as they move 
to more open economic and political systems

secretary of state james baker met in 
september with petur mladenov the new leader of bulgaria who 
served as foreign minister at the time the state department said 
monday 
baker met with mladenov at the un general assembly as part of 
a series of meetings with foreign ministers from around the world 
and the conversaton focused primarily on the expulsion of ethnic 
turks from bulgaria said spokesman richard boucher 
mladenov was bulgarias foreign minister until he was named 
general secretary of the communist party to replace todor zhivkov 
the veteran party boss who resigned in a surprise move last week 
boucher discounted a report in the washington post on saturday 
which said the bakermladenov meeting was held in secret it was 
laid on late in the week and it was the last meeting before they 
returned to washington and nobody asked he said 
baker consulted turkey beforehand and the turkish foreign 
minister supported the meeting boucher said 
it was a meeting during which the secretary made clear i 
think in the strongest possible terms that the united states 
needed to see improvements in the human rights situation in 
bulgaria particularly as regard turkish nationalities 
more than 300000 bulgarians of turkish origin have fled their 
country this year to protest harsh treatment by bulgaria and forced 
assimilation most have gone to neighboring turkey 
boucher said baker and mladenov also discussed the need for 
political reform in bulgaria 
thenforeign minister mladenov spoke very positively about the 
need for constructive change boucher said but as for the 
situation now we feel that the new general secretary faces a very 
difficult challenge in bringing needed reforms to bulgaria and we 
hope that he will move vigorously to build a more open and 
democratic bulgaria 
bulgaria has only a fledgling opposition movement unlike some 
of the other eastern european countries such as poland and hungary 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said its too early to 
comment on any new directions the country may be taking we just 
dont have enough information

the congress of peoples deputies the supreme 
organ of the soviet government and forum for televised diatribes 
about all the countrys ills will convene dec 12 the legislature 
decided monday 
the congress is the centerpiece of president mikhail s 
gorbachevs political reforms he called its first session in late 
spring the most outstanding event in the entire history of the 
soviet state 
its 2250 deputies were elected in the countrys first 
competitive elections in more than 70 years and many spoke out 
against everything from the kgb to the empty shelves in soviet 
stores 
the agenda for the coming session will include discussion of 
radical measures to improve the economy and the fight against 
rising organized crime tass reported monday 
the congress will also consider changing the electoral system 
and bills on constitutional compliance a reference to the 
growing number of parliaments in restive soviet republics that have 
passed laws contradicting the countrys constitution 
deputies of the supreme soviet legislature which was elected by 
the congress also proposed monday that the congress address the 
article of the constitution that makes the communist party the 
leading force in soviet society but their motion failed by 
just a few votes tass said 
the constitutional article on the communist party has come under 
increasing fire in recent weeks including among striking coal 
miners in the soviet arctic who included cancellation of the 
article in their demands 
the first congress of peoples deputies was broadcast live on 
national tv whether that practice would be repeated was in 
question because soviet leaders complained that the whole country 
watched with such rapt attention that productivity dropped 
significantly 
gorbachev lauded the first congress as heralding a new stage 
of perestroika his program of reforms 
human rights activist andrei d sakharov who was also a deputy 
to the congress said on the final day that the session had failed 
in its primary mission as he defined it to establish an effective 
new system of power

the justice department will end its court 
appeals involving the delayed irancontra case against former cia 
station chief joseph fernandez a department spokesman said monday 
dan eramian said the department would not contest a sept 29 
appeals court ruling which concluded the power to appeal decisions 
on classified material rests in the hands of irancontra prosecutor 
lawrence walsh 
we are pleased that the justice department has decided not to 
delay the fernandez case further by additional appeals walshs 
office said in a statement we are prepared to proceed to trial 
eramian noted however that the justice department reserves the 
right to file an affidavit in court in the fernandez case barring 
the disclosure of classified material that would damage national 
security 
fernandez an excia operative in costa rica was scheduled to 
go on trial july 24 but the justice department obtained an 
emergency stay from the us court of appeals in richmond va 
after the cia said it needed to protect certain classified 
information that fernandez wanted to use in court 
the material concerned three cia locations including stations 
in honduras and el salvador and three cia programs in costa rica 
filing an affidavit in court could scuttle some or all of the 
criminal charges against fernandez that in turn could lead to 
court appeals by the independent counsels office in an attempt to 
save the case 
the justice department appealed after us district court judge 
claude hilton rejected prosecutors proposals to substitute numbers 
for the names of the three cia locations and to drop part of one 
criminal charge against fernandez to avoid mentioning the cia 
programs in costa rica 
fernandez who assisted oliver norths secret contra resupply 
network is accused of obstructing the tower commission and the cia 
inspector generals office and making false statements in the 
irancontra affair

vice president dan quayle said 
monday that the reunification of east and west germany is 
inevitable some day and that the rejoined nation will be allied 
with the forces of freedom and democracy 
quayle said it wont happen soon but youre going to see it 
and it will be oriened toward western values 
in a speech to the republican governors association and an 
interview with a group of reporters quayle said president bush has 
taken the lead in dealing with the changes sweeping eastern europe 
he said that it is the democrats not the president who have been 
timid in handling change at home and abroad and that all they 
want to do is spend more money 
the vice president told the governors that the 1980s were a 
republican decade because the party delivered on the central issues 
of peace and opportunity 
he said he was not going to second guess the gop defeats in 
offyear elections last tuesday he said republicans can broaden 
their constituency and build a governing conservatism in the 
1990s 
the democrats havent had a new idea for 30 years quayle 
said 
sixteen of the 22 republican governors were on hand for the 
resort island conference their ranks will dwindle to 21 when new 
jersey switches to a democrat in january 
but quayle said republicans can gain command by taking the lead 
on issues such as education the environment drug control and 
economic competition 
on the issue of peace we have reaffirmed once and for all 
that a commitment to a strong national defense and an investment in 
national defense pays dividends he said what is going on in 
eastern europe today is no accident 
but he also said the united states faces a continuing communist 
challenge in nicaragua cuba and el salvador despite whatever 
soviet intentions may be there is no doubt that their clients in 
this region are conducting war and terror he said 
quayle said that will be one of the issues discussed when bush 
and soviet president mikhail sgorbachev meet dec 2 and 3 off 
malta 
the vice president said that bush has been out front in 
dealing with the changes sweeping eastern europe and that the 
president has been properly cautious because a misstep could be 
counterproductive 
bush has said that he favors eventual german reunification but 
that he isnt pushing it or trying to set a timetable 
quayle did neither but his comments were more forceful than the 
presidents 
the democrats havent offered one creative idea on how to 
manage the evolving situation in eastern europe or the soviet union 
except to criticize the president he said later in an interview 
with several reporters he said bush has been properly cautious 
but nevertheless out front on this issue 
the east german government has opened the berlin wall to free 
travel and has promised elections 
its going to take some time but the reunification of germany 
is eventually inevitable quayle said once the east german 
communist system goes by the wayside then there becomes a less 
convincing reason why it should remain as a separate country 
thats what keeps it separate poland is poland hungary is 
hungary east germany is east germany because of the communist 
system do away with the communist system and its germany 
quayle said that reunification would not mean the end of nato or 
the warsaw pact but that the western and eastern alliances 
certainly would change 
a unified germany in defense alliances will continue to look 
west it will continue to be allied with the forces of freedom and 
democracy which is the west quayle said but what the 
president wants to see is a europe in his words thats whole and 
free 
in washington house majority leader richard gephardt speaking 
before the democratic leadership council attacked bush for 
timidity and inaction in the face of revolutionary times 
as the walls of the modern jericho come tumbling down we have 
a president who is inadequate to the moment gephardt said at 
the very time freedom and democracy are receiving standing ovations 
in europe our president is sitting politely in the audience with 
little to say and even less to contribute

a man identified as a suspect in the shooting of a 
pregnant woman and her husband last month was arraigned monday on 
an unrelated armed robbery charge 
william bennett 39 of bostons mission hill section where 
carol and charles stuart were attacked pleaded not guilty to 
charges he held up a brookline video store on oct 2 he was being 
held on 35000 cash bail at the norfolk county house of

where attorney judith lindahl appeared in bennetts defense 
lindahl said she had been contacted by the committee for public 
counsel to defend whomever might be charged in connection with the 
stuart shootings 
asked if she thought bennett might be charged in connection with 
those shootings she said i have no inside knowledge on what the 
das office will do she had said earlier in the day that if he 
is charged there is sufficient publicity in the case to deny my 
client a fair trial 
bennetts mother pauline told the boston herald that her son 
was a suspect in the shooting that fatally wounded mrs stuart and 
her infant son christopher as well as injuring charles stuart 
mrs stuart 30 died after she was shot by a man who abducted 
her and her husband on oct 23 just as they were leaving brigham 
and womens hospital where they had attended a birthing class 
stuart 29 was listed in stable condition monday in intensive 
care after having surgery saturday at boston city hospital but 
hospital officials would not give a reason for the surgery 
the infant was delivered by caesarean section and clung to life 
for more than two weeks before succumbing to a respiratory ailment 
thursday the medical examiner ruled his death a homicide 
in the brookline courtroom crowley granted a motion by attorney 
joel goodman to let bennett sit concealed behind the witness stand 
goodman said the repeated publication of bennetts picture could 
bias witnesses or potential jurors 
bennetts presence in the charlestown court had been waived 
because of the publicity surrounding his arrest

a federal panel moved the seabrook nh 
nuclear power plant a step closer to opening by announcing monday 
it has approved evacuation plans for neighboring massachusetts 
communities 
the atomic safety and licensing board had been told by opponents 
of the plant that evacuating the densely populated coastal region 
particularly during busy summer months would be impossible in a 
nuclear emergency 
in a 571page decision the threemember board also approved an 
evacuation exercise conducted last year in massachusetts and new 
hampshire saying it was adequate in scope and revealed no 
fundamental flaw 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon within hours filed 
a motion with the boards appeal panel to overturn the ruling 
if the decision of the licensing board is allowed to stand 
and i dont think it can stand then it would put at ristk the 
safety of hundreds of thousands of citizens who live in 
massachusetts and new hampshire said shannon 
but the 63 billion reactor could still receive a fullpower 
license even before the appeals run their course said nuclear 
regulatory commission spokesman john kopeck seabrook officials 
have said they expect the plant to be licensed around the first of 
next year 
this is a major development that brings seabrook closer to a 
fullpower license said plant spokesman ron sher the 
emergency plans for seabrook have been evaluated by the experts 
the federal emergency management agency the staff of the nrc and 
the advisory committee on reactor safeguards and their 
conclusions are that seabrooks emergency plans are among the best 
in the country 
seabrook was originally planned to cost less than 1 billion and 
begin operation in 1979 the plant has been plagued with repeated 
delays due to financing problems faced by its principal owner 
public service company of new hampshire protests mounted by 
neighbors of the plant regulatory changes brought about by the 
1979 three mile island nuclear accident and the opposition of 
massachusetts officials 
in the licensing boards ruling dated nov 9 and made public 
monday the board found reasonable assurance that adequate 
protective measures can and will be taken in the event of a 
radiological emergency at the seabrook station in accordance with 
the commissions emergency planning regulations and precedents 
 
the licensing board cleared away another potential obstacle to a 
fullpower license by ruling that a recent appeal board decision on 
the new hampshire evacuation plans posed no major problem in the 
licensing process 
several flaws in the new hampshire plans found by the appeal 
board in a ruling last week do not preclude the immediate 
issuance of an operating license for the seabrook station the 
board said 
the next step in the complex process involves a 30day review 
period by the nrc a public meeting held by the full commission at 
which the nrc staff makes its recommendations on the plant and a 
final decision on issuing a license by the commission 
shannon who was in washington for an attorneys general 
conference was joined in front of the capitol building by 
massachusetts sens john kerry and edward m kennedy 
kennedy called the licensing board ruling perhaps the most 
irrespoinsible action that i have seen taken by any administrative 
agency in the 28 years that i have been in the united states 
senate he called for a congressional investigation into the 
process that led to mondays announcement kerry called the 
decision abusive and arrogant

the ruling politburo restored communist 
party membership to 11 advocates of reform monday and sources who 
follow bulgarian politics predicted a purge of top party ranks 
within weeks 
the sources bulgarians and diplomats said a housecleaning also 
was expected in the top levels of government as a result of the 
removal friday of todor zhivkov 78 who led the party with rigid 
orthodoxy for 35 years 
he was succeeded by foreign minister petar mladenov 53 who 
served 18 years as foreign minister and is considered more open to 
reform 
parliament is to meet wednesday to choose a new president to 
replace zhivkov and the party central committee is expected to 
order other personnel changes soon 
bta the official news agency said most of the activists whose 
party memberships were restored were members of the independent 
club for the support of glasnost and perestroika which 
incorporates soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs russian 
catchwords for change 
the politburo also proposed that those who lost their jobs as a 
result of unorthodox views be reinstated 
among those taken back into the party were ivan dzhadzhev and 
koprinka chervenkova the clubs chairman and spokeswoman 
respectively 
dzhadzhev a professor of esthetics at the higher institute of 
theatrical art in sofia said in an interview sunday the group was 
thriving despite intimidation and repression 
he said its unifying aim was democratization of our 
society and predicted that within five years the political 
landscape in bulgaria will be totally different from what it is 
now political pluralism will become a reality 
also monday the supreme court said the sofia city court must 
reconsider the application for legal status of another independent 
group ecoglasnost because it made procedural mistakes the first 
time 
representatives of the environmental group said the decision 
improved the chances of official approval no date was announced 
for the new hearing 
one bulgarian source described mladenov as a wellconnected 
politician with good relations in moscow where he was educated 
mladenov stopped in moscow on his way home from a recent trip to 
china but sources discounted rumours that zhivkov was ousted at 
gorbachevs behest 
a bta dispatch monday said mladenov had spoken with gorbachev by 
telephone since becoming party chief and they pledged to strengthen 
cooperation 
according to the sources zhivkovs fate was decided at a secret 
meeting of the 10member politburo on nov 9 the day before the 
central committee announced his resignation 
it had been rumored for years that zhivkov was on the way out 
the sources both bulgarians and diplomats said resistance to his 
departure came from the men around him rather than the leader 
himself 
bulgarian sources confirmed rumors circulating among diplomats 
before friday that mladenov had offered to resign as foreign 
minister earlier this month 
they said he made the offer a few days before he was to lead a 
bulgarian delegation in talks with turkish officials about the 
dispute over 15 million ethnic turks in bulgaria zhivkov named 
deputy premier georgi yardanov to head the delegation 
one reason mladenov wanted to resign was that hardliners 
criticized his successful efforts to have a 35nation environmental 
conference held in sofia the sources said 
the conference gave several new bulgarian reform groups their 
first opportunity to express their views publicly they held 
rallies and news conferences to explain their objectives to 
diplomats and journalists 
mladenov is said to have disagreed with methods the government 
used to bulgarize the ethnic turkish minority 
in washington the state department disclosed monday that 
secretary of state james a baker iii met with him in september at 
the un general assembly in new york department spokesman richard 
boucher said their talks focused primarily on the flight of ethnic 
turks from bulgaria 
about 320000 bulgarian turks fled religious and cultural 
discrimination in bulgaria but nearly 60000 have returned because 
they could not find jobs or housing 
mladenov was against the methods applied to the ethnic 
turks including the use of security forces in 198485 to force 
them to take bulgarian names one source reported 
opinions differ about whether or at what pace mladenov will 
bring political or economic change 
a western diplomat said he has not been known to us as a 
reformer but bulgarian sources said mladenov was expected to 
move cautiously in that direction

students hoping to impress wouldbe bosses 
with their straight a grades would be helped along under an 
ambitious new plan to use computers to link young jobseekers with 
potential employers 
it is called the incentive to learn project and its backers are 
no less than american businesses eager to get qualified workers 
with basic skills and a good track record 
the need for this is to set up a framework whereby employers 
and workbound students can communicate more effectively said 
barry rogstead president of the american business conference 
abc together with the national alliance of business and 
educational testing service plans to set up a computerized 
information system that will record a students achievements and 
make the record available to potential employers 
they call it a training and experience information system 
beginning in the sixth or seventh grade rogstead said the 
student works on building a file which contains that students 
employment history any summer jobs course transcripts evaluation 
and some testing it will be much more a performance assessment 
than just simple percentile rankings on an achievement test 
rogstead said the idea will be tested in five to 25 labor 
markets in the next two to three years 
it will be an opportunity for students who never before were 
able to get into an employer network to get into the game in an 
organized way he said there is no question that the business 
community will have to channel in some seed money 
the idea was broached at the national governors conference last 
july by the american business conference 
companies are the largest customers of what the school 
supplies educated graduates said a statement issued by the abc 
in the past companies were fairly indifferent shoppers that 
must change the workforce is shrinking at just the time that 
demand for literate and arithmetically adept employees is 
expanding firms have no choice but to demand greater quality from 
the schools 
rogstead said a problem of the past has been that business has 
not articulated well what it requires from students and that at 
those times when information was asked from schools it was not 
always forthcoming 
there is a lack of communication from both sides he said 
asking rhetorically are we giving the student a very concrete 
sense that if he attempts to do better in school and take tougher 
courses anybody out there in the business world is going to take 
time to notice 
can we ask why students are not motivated if we dont 
differentiate one high school diploma from another 
the information system will be called worklink 
a brochure says that students would compile their records at 
their own pace and these records would be readily accessed by 
employers the student could order a copy of his or her record to 
be sent to specific employers agencies or training institutions 
the individual would control his or her worklink record only 
attainment not failure would be recorded the brochure sys 
worklink records begun in high school could serve persons 
throughout their working careers with continued updates at a number 
of agencies in the community a persons worklink record would 
eventually be usable throughout the us

a humanpowered helicopter has 
made its first flight with a bicycle racers leg muscles spinning 
the crafts 100foot rotor blade 
videotape was used to verify that it lifted several inches off 
the ground for several seconds sunday inside a gymnasium bob 
anderson a spokesman for california state polytechnic university 
san luis obispo said monday 
no previous humanpowered helicopter has ever gotten off the 
ground even though the idea for such a craft dates back nearly 500 
years to the sketches of leonardo da vinci said chris colligan 
with the american helicopter society in alexandria va 
the 100pound copter known as the da vinci iii hovered inches 
above the floor under the pedaling power of cyclist greg mcneil a 
cal poly aeronautical engineering major who races on the us 
cycling team 
the da vinci iii is the fourth helicopter to be built by 
students since 1981 when the project was first attempted the last 
version the da vinci iib was damaged in may 
students began preparing the helicopter for its flight saturday 
night making subtle adjustments necessary for a stable flight 
said david calta 22 president of the local student chapter of the 
american helicopter society 
the craft made mostly of composite materials and plastic 
finally took to the air at around 7 am sunday 
we dont know what time it was exactly it was so exciting 
that nobody bothered to look at their watches said anderson 
neal saiki 23 a cal poly senior who has worked on the project 
for more than two years said three specific improvements 
contributed to the success of the latest model 
we made it lighter we made the rotors straighter and we got a 
pilot with a better output saiki said 
the next step the students said will be to fly the helicopter 
for officials of the american helicopter society who must witness 
a flight before the da vinci iii formally becomes a part of 
aviation history 
after that the students said theyll call the guinness book of 
world records 
dont look for a home version saiki said 
its far too big to ever be popular he said i mean it 
fills up the gym practically wall to wall

east german legislators elected a reformoriented 
premier and discussed the idea of free elections monday during a 
frank debate that departed abruptly from parliaments usual 
rubberstamp role 
the new premier hans modrow likely will wield more clout than 
his predecessor willi stoph who resigned last week he is 
expected to initiate a measure of political democracy and to 
address growing economic problems 
in an unusual development stoph an unquestioning follower of 
ousted communist leader erich honecker since he assumed the 
premiership in 1964 accused honecker and other former ranking 
communists of misusing their powers 
stoph also acknowledged his government had erred in not 
consulting with parliament on major decisions the state news 
agency adn said 
only one of 477 deputies present at the 500seat parliament 
meeting voted against modrow an indication of the chambers 
support for reforms 
the session was carried in full on state television 
modrow 61 the former communist party chief in dresden is 
considered by many to be east germanys answer to soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
central authorities singled him out in june for rare public 
criticism saying he failed to control bourgeois and enemy 
views in dresden after an early demonstration of citizens 
demanding free travel to the west 
much of mondays debate in the legislature was dominated by 
normally docile noncommunist deputies who criticized the 
leadership for restricting their role 
we expect that the constitutional rights of parliament will 
be strictly observed in the future so that our parliament will 
never again be discredited declared michael koplanski of the 
liberal party 
parliament also picked a noncommunist speaker in the chambers 
first secret ballot and urged accelerated changes 
previously there has been only one candidate for the post of 
speaker and the candidate usually has been approved unanimously 
of those present 246 deputies voted for guenther maleuda in the 
second round while his closest rival manfred gerlach gathered 
230 votes 
maleuda is head of the democratic peasant party of germany one 
of four noncommunist parties that have been allowed to exist in 
exchange for accepting the authority of the communists 
some of the deputies urging free and secret elections were 
highranking communists among them werner jarowinsky a member of 
the policysetting politburo he also urged the formation of a 
coalition government that would allow the noncommunist parties 
more influence 
political arrogance of the previous party and state 
leadership cost east german communists the trust of the people and 
plunged the country into its economic and social crisis jarowinsky 
said 
he also indirectly criticized the countrys record on human 
rights saying international norms must be strictly observed 
some deputies echoing the demands of prodemocracy activists 
also appealed for removal from the constitution of language 
declaring the nation a socialist state

a recount of the votes in yonkers mayoral 
election was completed monday and confirmed the election of 
republican henry spallone a vigorous opponent of the citys 
courtordered desegregation plan 
spallone had been proclaimed mayor on election night ousting 
nicholas wasicsko by 4466 votes but in the first stage of the 
recount wasicsko suddenly picked up nearly 1700 votes and an 
election commissioner said the result could be reversed 
but on monday the final unofficial tally showed spallone with 
29294 for spallone and 25021 for wasicsko a democrat who had 
urged compliance with the desegregation plan according to 
elections commissioner antonia dapice 
that left spallone ahead by 4273 votes 
thats the ball game wasicsko said 
about 1300 absentee and affidavit ballots remain but wasicsko 
cant overcome the difference said dapice 
the key issue in the race was the citys housing desegregation 
order spallone has been its most vocal opponent and wasicsko its 
most aggressive supporter 
the makeup of the city council and its approach to the 
desegregation order was also affected by the outcome of the mayoral 
race the council without the mayor was evenly split with three

the house approved a bill monday to transfer a 
priceless collection of indian artifacts from new yorks museum of 
the american indian to the smithsonian institution for display in 
museums in washington and new york 
the measure may at long last make peace among politicians 
native americans and archaeologists first by resolving a 
10yearold dispute in new york over how to display and preserve 
the heye foundation collection of more than a million indian 
artifacts 
second it stipulates that the smithsonian institution where 
possible return its collection of some 18000 indian remains to 
their original tribes for burial 
the question of the remains had been the last obstacle to 
crafting a passable bill and compromise came in september when 
smithsonian secretary robert mccormick adams reversed the museums 
longheld policy that the bones were necessary for study indians 
nationwide seeking to bury their ancestors heralded his decision 
as a watershed that will influence other museums 
the house passed the measure on a voice vote a similar bill 
passed the senate on oct 3 but because of slight differences in 
the two bills language sen daniel k inouye dhawaii planned 
to ask the senate to approve the house version tuesday said inouye 
spokeswoman pat zell 
sen inouye has asked for the consent of the senate to bring 
up the bill as amended and have the senate approve that bill and 
send it directly to the white house zell said monday 
suzan shown harjo a trustee of the museum of the american 
indian was confident that the senate would go along with the plan

indian in the last available space on the washington mall between

would be established in the old us custom house in lower 
manhattan both new york state and new york city have pledged to 
contribute up to 8 million apiece toward converting the building

challenge to the kremlin by annulling the baltic republics 1940 
decision to join the soviet union but did not actually vote to 
secede tass reported monday 
the official news ageny said the legislature passed a resolution 
sunday accusing the soviet union of aggression military 
occupation and annexation of the estonian republic and declaring 
the vote in 1940 unlawful 
legislatures of the baltic republics estonia latvia and 
lithuania already have condemned the sovietgerman agreement of 
1939 that gave free rein to hitler in poland and to stalin in the 
baltics the soviet union absorbed the baltic republics the next 
year 
soviet historians maintain the baltic states joined the soviet 
union for protection against hitler western historians and baltic 
activists say the unions were forced 
a special commission of the national parliament led by 
politburo member alexander n yakovlev is reviewing the status of 
the baltic republics 
the estonian resolution passed sunday specified that it did not 
invoke article 69 of the republics constitution which says 
estonia retains the right to freely leave the ussr 
both the text and a top official of the estonian communist party 
said the resolution would be the basis instead for negotiating 
greater independence within the soviet framework 
estonia has led the baltic states in legal and legislative 
challenges to kremlin authority its supreme court has asserted 
estonias right to refuse national laws and estonians have been 
most vocal in demanding more autonomy 
tass said the latest resolution caused stormy debate sunday in 
the estonian legislature and that 46 deputies walked out at one 
point to protest the refusal to postpone the vote 
miik tiitma a ranking official of the estonian party 
emphasized that the republic did not intend to secede but that the

the head of the citys police union vowed monday 
to continue to fight against random drug tests after the us 
supreme court let stand a ruling that forces officers to undergo 
the tests 
the nations highest court without comment left intact a 
ruling that the tests do not violate the police officers privacy 
even when there is no reason to suspect drug abuse 
there are different legal avenues that we can follow one is 
to take the rule right back into the state courts and challenge the 
constitutionality said robert guiney president of the boston 
police patrolmens association 
drug testing should be used only when there is probable or 
reasonable cause to suspect an officers drug use he said 
im very disappointed im disappointed in the fact the 
supreme court has said that police officers in this city and in 
this country have different constitutional rights than other 
citizens said guiney who has led the fight against random tests 
for three years 
fighting testing in court he said might be an opportunity to 
sit down and do some bargaining over this which is originally 
where we were when this thing started 
boston police officials say the tests are needed to assure 
public confidence and to prevent officers from becoming susceptible 
to bribery because of a drug habit 
over time i believe that this procedure will enhance the 
health and safety for dedicated professionals of whom society 
expects so much in terms of the dangers they face and the risks 
they undertake to protect the public safety police commissioner 
francis roache said in a statement monday 
in its first drugtesting rulings in march the supreme court 
upheld drug and alcohol tests for railway workers involved in 
accidents and us customs service employees applying for 
drugenforcement jobs or those positions that require carrying a 
firearm 
neither ruling directly addressed the question of random tests 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals nevertheless relied on 
those decisions in may in upholding the constitutionality of random 
urinalysis tests for boston police officers who carry firearms or 
enforce drug laws 
the appeals court overturned a decision by us district judge 
robert e keeton that the tests violate the officers rights 
since we can find no relevant distinction between a customs 
officer and a police officer we hold the police departments 
drugtesting rule to be constitutional the appeals court said

east germanys parliament elected a leading 
reformer as the new premier monday night but hundreds of thousands 
of protesters took to the streets of leipzig to say communist 
reforms are moving too slowly 
after a historic weekend in which millions of east germans took 
advantage of their new freedom to travel west parliament also 
picked a noncommunist speaker in the chambers first secret ballot 
and urged accelerated changes 
and the government said it was dismantling internal barriers 
that for three decades formed a notorious death strip between 
the berlin wall and the citys sealedoff eastern sector 
deputies appealed for truly free elections a coalition 
government and removal from the constitution of language declaring 
their nation a socialist state 
the parliament known as the peoples chamber then approved the 
communist partys nomination of politburo member hans modrow to 
lead a new government as premier the government traditionally has 
been subservient to the party 
modrow is a wellknown reformer within the party which has been 
led by egon krenz since oct 18 krenz has promised some reforms 
including free elections 
as deputies argued into the night in east berlin prodemocracy 
activists in leipzig in the center of the country pressed for 
continued change to prolong the spirit of hope sweeping the nation 
open borders by themselves cannot be the only freedom 
warned a banner carried by some in the crowd 
west german television estimated the number of protesters at 
200000 to 300000 
the protesters urged the government to live up to its promise of 
free elections and questioned the commitment of the new leadership 
the question is are you the new government really different 
from the others one speaker said at the rally 
in the northern city of schwerin another 10000 people staged a 
prodemocracy rally 
at the session to approve modrow the first secret balloting in 
the communistdominated parliament elected a new speaker guenther 
maleuda who told the assembly it was dutybound to heed the calls 
of the reform movement 
maleuda 58 is the chairman of the democratic peasants party 
one of the four small parties allied with the ruling communists 
the communist party did not propose a candidate for the post 
in addition to the parliamentary session the partys 163member 
central committee set dec 15 for an emergency party congress that 
will elect a new leadership and rewrite its political platform 
the party which has had a monopoly on power in the 40 years 
since east germany was created is struggling to meet the pentup 
demands of about 16 million citizens who have watched their 
communist neighbors restore democracy while they were denied the 
same freedoms 
modrow is an antiestablishment communist who enjoys broad 
popular support he was nominated to replace willi stoph who 
resigned last week along with his entire 44member cabinet 
about 100000 more east germans crossed into west berlin and 
west germany on monday but the arrivals were a trickle compared 
with the wave of 3 million visitors that went west over the weekend 
after travel restrictions were lifted 
the east german news agency adn said more than 5 million visas 
had been issued since thursday and that only about 10000 asked 
for emigration papers they seek to join more than 200000 who have 
resettled in west germany this year 
fewer than 1 percent of the weekend visitors stayed behind most 
people returned to their jobs and homes in east germany 
i really dont know whether i should be happy or pensive 
said michael werner an east berliner who made his first trip to 
the west this weekend 
some returned bitter over the contrast between the overflowing 
store shelves seen in the west and the barren ones at home 
this is what socialism looks like an east berlin man 
exclaimed after standing in line for oranges and being told they

secretary of state james a baker on monday 
said soviet action in central america and cuba has been the 
biggest obstacle to that countrys achieving better relations 
with the united states 
baker blamed the soviet union for aiding el salvadoran 
guerrillas in their bloody offensive 
the soviet union bears a special responsibility because its 
arms and money moving through cuba and nicaragua continue to 
support violence destruction and war baker said in an address 
before the organization of american states shipments of soviet 
rocketpropelled grenades to the fmln are incompatible with the new 
thinking 
he added soviet behavior toward cuba and central america 
remains the biggest obstacle to a full across the board imporvement 
in relations between the united states and the soviet union 
baker joined other administration officials in condeming what he 
called acts of terror by the leftist salvadoran guerrillas 
known as the fmln hundreds of people have been killed in the small 
central american nation in the fighting that began over the weekend 
its a very difficult situation with this very large and 
organized and clearly calculated offensive under way white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said and while it is being handled 
it certainly represents an escalation of the attacks from anything 
weve seen in recent months 
the president stands with the freelyelected government of el 
salvador in condemning this senseless violence he said 
fitzwater said el salvadors president alfredo cristiani had 
not asked for assistance to quell the fighting the heaviest since 
a 1981 offensive by the marxistled rebels he said he would not 
rule out us involvement adding we can never predict the 
future but at this point its not anticipated 
the united states provides el salvador with about 15 million a 
day in economic and military aid fiftyfive american military 
advisers are assigned to train the salvadoran troops but are not 
supposed to take part in field operations 
at the state department deputy spokesman richard boucher said 
christopher babcock of spokane wash was killed sunday when he 
was hit in the head by a grenade fragment he was a teacher at the 
american school in san salvador the capital 
fitzwater cited reports of recent arms shipments to the rebels 
from the sandinista government in nicaragua adding the latest 
attacks show that much more of the sandinista arms designed to 
destabilize and overthrow the legitimate government of el salvador 
have been getting through 
at the organization of american states nicaraguan foreign 
minister miguel descoto introduced a resolution monday calling for 
an urgent appeal to the salvadoran government to cease 
immediately the bombing of the civilian population and other acts 
of repression 
the rebels launched the offensive sunday after pulling out of 
peace talks to protest a series of attacks on leftist political and 
union leaders which they blamed on the usbacked government 
cristiani whose official residence was attacked declared a state 
of siege rescinding basic civil liberties and imposing a 6 pm to 
6 am curfew nationwide 
boucher defended the move saying the imposition of a state 
of siege of limited duration by the government we believe is a 
responsible measure to protect civilians from the fmlns farabundo 
marti national liberation front latest campaign of terror 
sen patrick j leahy dvt the chairman of the foreign 
operations subcommittee said cristianis rightist government 
should move with caution 
they should be very careful that they not fall back into the 
patterns that held the government in disrepute in the first 
place he said adding that his criticizm of the administrations 
handling of el salvador has been justified 
i have been critical of the administration for giving an alls 
well attitude down there leahy said and in view of the events 
this weekend its not 
rep robert lagomarsino rcalif said the guerrilla offensive 
showed the rebels are obviously desperate and defended 
cristianis suspension of civil rights by saying i think wed do 
exactly the same thing if rebels were attacking washington dc 
the spokesman said about 1500 guerrillas infiltrated into san 
salvador for the attack and that fighting in the capital caused 
significant civilian casualties there have been attacks in other 
cities and on armed forces brigade headquarters in outlying 
provinces 
boucher said there were indications in the past that something 
like this might happen 
us embassy personell and their dependants were staying close 
to home he said the american school was closed the pentagon 
declined to comment on whether the military advisers assigned to 
outlying bases had been recalled to the capital

the west coast is suffering an extended 
epidemic of hepatitis a a virulent liver disease with flulike 
symptoms that has struck thousands this year 
health officials blame the diseases spread partly on 
intravenous drug users and the fact that hepatitis can occur 
undetected in young children 
although a hepatitis a vaccine has been developed it may be six 
years or more before the us food and drug administration approves 
its use 
through oct 28 1951 hepatitis a cases were reported in 
oregon 2613 in washington 5635 in california and 2032 in 
arizona according to dr gary schatz hepatitis control officer 
for the centers for disease control in atlanta nationwide 27869 
cases were reported during the same 10month period 
the west coast is very high said dr harold osterud 
chairman of the department of public health and preventive medicine 
at oregon health sciences university in portland were not at 
all sure why that is true certainly the number of cases in the 
midwest and the east seem to be remarkably lower 
for example oregon with a population of 27 million has 
recorded far more cases than larger states such as virginia with a 
population of 59 million and only 255 cases or minnesota with a 
population of 24 million and only 139 cases 
the disease spreads through fecaloral transmission its from 
using the toilet and not washing your hands oregon health 
division spokesman art keil explained 
the illness is marked by fatigue flulike symptoms nausea and 
vomiting and pain in the liver on the right upper side of the 
abdomen 
thats where it does its damage osterud said if the 
liver is involved most older people will become jaundiced young 
children and up through the teenager and so forth frequently dont 
become jaundiced 
schatz said onehalf of 1 percent of hepatitis a victims die 
all of them adults and many of them pregnant women 
prevention focuses mainly on promoting sanitary toilet habits 
but once the virus is introduced into a community its spread is 
difficult to control doctors say 
the disease often passes unnoticed in children making their 
family members and care providers likely victims day care centers 
where healthy and infected children may play together provide a 
prime setting for spreading the disease 
with diaperage kids people are used to seeing them with 
diarrhea anyway and you dont chalk it up to anything worth 
worrying about schatz said and theyre rarely ill for any 
length of time 
oregon statistics show the most cases are reported among adults 
under the age of 40 while they may be infected by others in their 
household the primary carriers among adults appear to be 
intravenous needle users and food handlers keil said 
needle use is very high on the west coast especially among 
methamphetamine users according to lt bob miller narcotic unit 
commander for the oregon state police 
however while there also are a large number of intravenous drug 
users in new york that state reported just 344 cases of hepatitis 
a through oct 28 schatz said 
once contracted the virus simply runs its course unless the 
patient is aware of having been exposed before the symptoms occur 
15 to 30 days later osterud said 
immune globulin can be injected within two weeks of exposure 
and will protect against the illness or at least make it less 
severe although a vaccine has been developed by smithkline 
beecham an international pharmaceutical company it has just begun 
to be tested in the united states 
it is still early in clinical trials which run for three to 
six years spokeswoman sharon arnold said by telephone from 
philadelphia where the companys smith kline amp french laboratories 
are located 
until the vaccine is available the disease will continue to 
spread schatz said

an elections official said monday her staff 
will check returns with a finetooth comb before certifying the 
result of the tight governors race which apparently was won by 
lt gov l douglas wilder 
susan fitzhugh secretary of the electoral board said the 
states 136 localities have finished their official canvass of the 
nov 7 balloting for governor lieutenant governor attorney 
general the house of delegates and local offices and referendums 
wilder a democrat who would be the nations first elected black 
governor leads republican j marshall coleman a former attorney 
general by a few thousand votes 
a canvass of all local registrars monday to obtain final figures 
showed wilder with 897125 votes to 890273 for coleman a margin 
of 6852 out of 178 million votes cast results from three 
counties had not been verified 
coleman has said he will ask for a recount if wilders lead of 
less than half a percent holds up 
ms fitzhugh said state law requires that the election results 
be certified on the fourth monday of november which is nov 27 
she said her office needs the two weeks to recheck the results from 
each locality 
we go through the election precinct by precinct we 
computerize the figures she said if we find a problem we 
then have to call the locality walk through the whole processs 
with them to find out where the error is and get them to change 
their figures if necessary 
checking balloting will be no more painstaking than it would be 
if one candidate won in a landslide ms fitzhugh said we go 
through it with a finetooth comb anyway 
if the state finds a problem that occurred on election night 
the officers of the election for that precinct are called in ms 
fitzhugh said 
we usually have at least 50 that have to be contacted and 
officers called in she said

the top local prosecutors for chicago and los 
angeles forged an information link monday in the fight against 
drugs a connection they want to expand into a national network of 
prosecutors against crime 
state boundaries are artificial when youre dealing with 
narcotics said ira reiner the los angeles county district 
attorney 
gangs and other large drug dealers are becoming multistate 
enterprises said cook county states attorney cecil a partee 
the two appeared at a news conference where reiner said los 
angeles has become cocaines number one point of entry in the 
united states 
and the cocaine that is sold on the streets here in chicago 
begins at one point in los angeles reiner said 
so it makes a great deal of sense that los angeles and cook 
county come together as the first two offices in what states 
attorney partee envisions as a national network of urban 
prosecutors 
partee said he has contacted his counterparts in miami and new 
york about the idea but has not worked out details with those 
offices 
he also plans to contact dallas houston and seattle said a 
spokesman for partee dan mccullough 
the recent infusion of crack into our community is believed to 
be closely linked to a new alliance between gangs in chicago and 
los angeles partee said 
chicago had until recently been free of crack a highly 
addictive derivative of cocaine authorities say 
partee said he and reiner will soon name liaisons to each 
others offices who will communicate by telephone 
prosecutors from different states have worked together before 
but not extensively reiner said 
we will have in los angeles the head deputy of our narcotics 
unit the head deputy of our gang unit in contact with their like 
numbers in the cook county office where there will be a 
constant and systematic exchange of information and intelligence 
reiner said 
before the news conference reiner and partee met with 
representatives of the us attorneys office the chicago police 
department and with community leaders to discuss cooperation in 
the drug war 
the cook county and los angeles county prosecutors began working 
together after members of a los angeles street gang known as the 
crips came to chicago in 1987 and killed a parkinggarage 
attendant 
two gang members were convicted of murder and sentenced in 
recent weeks one to 60 years the other to natural life a third 
defendant will be tried next month

the number of hungry people in the world is steadily 
rising because of the population growth environmental problems and 
economic crisis the directorgeneral of the un food and 
agriculture organization said monday 
eduoard saouma told delegates to the faos 25th biennial 
conference that the agency conservatively estimates there are 500 
million undernourished people in the world he did not give 
previous estimates 
he also said the worlds population increased by 178 million the 
last two years and 90 percent of the births were in third world 
countries the poorest and leastequipped to cope with this 
onslaught 
conference chairman john kerin of australia said the world 
population is about 5 billion now and is expected to expand to as 
much as 7 billion by the year 2000 
he said the delegates meeting to assess the faos operations for 
the next two years must recognize the need for more liberal trade 
policies and an end to large subsidies 
kerin also said the faos ability to respond to the worlds food 
problems is hindered by the financial crisis faced by the 
organization because some countries have not paid their assessments 
saouma of lebanon said the fao is facing its worst financial 
situation ever with unpaid contributions totaling 175 million 
organization officials said of that amount the united states owes 
143 million 
the directorgeneral said because of the problems the fao has 
had to scale down activities and services by 68 million over the 
last three years 
we have experienced virtually no growth in the last eight or 
nine years during which time needs have continued to mount said 
saouma he urged delegates to approve a 199091 budget of 574 
million and said that would provide only a net growth of 1 percent 
saouma gave this grim assessment of the worlds food problems 
protectionism practiced by industrialized nations and the debt 
crisis conspire against developing countries 
in 1987 alone the developed countries spent the colossal sum 
of 290 billion simply to protect their own agriculture such a 
policy obviously creates an obstacle for imports from the poor 
countries he said 
with the debt crisis developing countries send more money to 
the developed countries than they receive from them in 1988 
developing countries paid 43 billion more than they received 
industrialized nations are poisoning the earth and air 
one international conference follows another and the number of 
declarations multiplies but in practice the world persists in its 
suicidal behavior saouma said

chop em burn em or plow them under but 
get rid of them before the next westerly wind starts to blow mayor 
darrell bender wants federal help with his tumbleweed problem 
theres weeds out there over my head and im six feet tall 
the mayor said monday after meeting with officials of the us army 
corps of engineers from pierre 
ballshaped weeds grew to the size of cars on the wide mud flats 
created by the falling level of the missouri river the water line 
is 38 feet below the full mark 
last week strong winds snapped them loose and sent them bouncing 
into mobridge by the thousands where the weeds buried homes 
clogged streets and snagged in treetops 
the big concern is fire said bender because tumbleweeds burn 
explosively 
the city spent 8500 gathering and destroying the weeds most 
of that borrowed from the snow removal budget our city is 4180 
people and that cuts a dent in our budgeting process bender 
said 
corps officials told bender to send a letter detailing his costs 
and asking for reimbursement but made no promises 
theres no money allocated to pay for the cleanup or to destroy 
the millions of tumbleweeds still on federal land the officials 
said the weeds are growing thick in an area about 2 miles long and 
up to a mile wide bender said 
corps officials toured the tumbleweed areas monday to get ideas 
for control they gave no timetable and said they dont know 
whether the weeds will be chopped up burned or plowed under 
the corps officials said the government plans to seed the mud 
flats with a crop that will deter tumbleweeds next summer

a coalition of centerright parties led by 
novelist mario vargas llosa swept mayoral races nationwide 
according to results released monday strengthening vargas llosas 
bid for the presidency 
despite death threats from maoist shining path guerrillas 
peruvians turned out in large numbers sunday to elect mayors in 
nearly 2000 municipalities 
guerrillas caused the most problems in huancayo an andean city 
140 miles east of lima election officials there counted ballots by 
candlelight sunday night after the shining path blew up several 
power pylons causing a blackout 
vargas llosas democratic front won 23 mayoral posts of limas 
40 suburban districts 
the united left a coalition of marxistled parties won five of 
the posts the socialist accord a grouping of moderate left 
parties won one district mayors seat and an independent emerged 
victorious in another results for the remaining seats were not in 
a political independent television personality ricardo belmont 
defeated juan inchaustegui vargas llosas candidate in the race 
for mayor of metropolitan lima 
but belmont said before sundays voting that he supports vargas 
llosa in the april presidential race and the novelist embraced 
belmont as one of his own 
the governing aprista party of president alan garcia lost all 18 
of the posts it held in the lima districts 
with peru suffering from 3000 percent annual inflation the 
aprista party was given little chance of winning many seats 
the democratic front also dominated races in major cities 
throughout peru according to vote tallies available monday 
with counting completed in 15 of perus 24 state capitals the 
democratic front controlled eight of the mayoral offices the 
united left two the aprista party two and political independents 
or small regional parties held the others 
this has been the best demonstration before the world that 
peru is not the shining path is not crimes or kidnappings but is 
a country that wants to live in peace and democracy vargas llosa 
said 
results from small towns throughout peru were not expected for 
several days because of poor communications analysts said they 
expected them to follow the pattern of the bigger cities 
the shining path which has been fighting since 1980 to topple 
perus elected governments sought to disrupt the voting as the 
first stage in its campaign to block the presidential election 
death threats by the rebels who have killed scores of officials 
and candidates this year frightened anyone from running for office 
in more than 80 municipalities 
voting was mandatory but the rebels threatened to kill anyone 
who cast ballots the armed forces and police took control of 
larger towns and cities and provided security for voters 
total voter turnout was not known because of the lack of 
communication with remote regions 
despite precautions rebel violence killed seven people on 
election day 
authorities said shining path guerrillas shot and killed the 
aprista partys mayoral candidate early sunday in azangaro near 
the bolivian border 470 miles southeast of lima 
a man and a woman were electrocuted by falling power lines when 
a pylon was dynamited in the andean town of concepcion 
three adults and a child were killed and three people were 
wounded when one of them stepped on a mine on a road a few miles 
north of huancayo as they were returning home from the polls

president bush bestowed the presidential medal 
of freedom on lech walesa in an emotional white house ceremony 
monday and promised american aid has begun and more is coming 
to poland 
lech walesa showed how one individual could inspire in others 
a faith so powerful that it vindicated itself and changed the 
course of a nation bush said referring to the 1981 martial law 
crackdown against the first free trade union in the soviet bloc and 
its rise to power this year 
history may make men but lech walesa has made history bush 
said 
the portly polish trade union leader arrived in washington as 
the senate reached a bipartisan compromise on a plan to give 657 
million in aid to poland and 65 million to hungary ending a long 
battle over the proper scale of aid to those countries 
at the white house walesas eyes filled with tears as bush 
seated him in a chair with the solidarity banner draped across it 
and recalled the 1981 martial law crackdown in poland and the 11 
months that walesa spent incarcerated in a remote hunting lodge 
one of the greatest dreams of my life has just been 
fulfilled walesa said in thanking bush 
the united states he said is a democratic example for nations 
around the world 
i am full of admiration for your country not because it is a 
big power and not because it is rich said walesa i admire 
america as a country of freedom freedom of man and freedom of the 
nation 
you took that freedom yourselves nobody gave it to you as a 
present you built it through your hard work step by step created 
wonderful democratic institutions which are an example for many 
other countries he said 
the crowd of 200 politicians labor leaders and others packed 
into the east room gave walesa a standing ovation on his entrance 
with the president bush too joined in the applause which became 
rhythmic 
walesa blinked back tears as bush recalled how he was taken off 
to prison on the night of dec 13 1981 after making the sign of 
the cross on the foreheads of his sleeping children a translator 
whispered bushs words into walesas ear 
after bushs 10minute speech a military aide brought a box 
containing the presidential medal of freedom and bush draped around 
walesas neck the gold medal dangling from a blue ribbon 
at the end of the ceremony bush surprised lane kirkland 
president of the aflcio by giving him the presidential citizens 
medal for his unions efforts on behalf of solidarity 
walesa greeted kirkland with a bear hug 
walesas trip to the white house was the first stop on a us 
tour that will include a speech to congress a private dinner at 
the white house and attendance at the annual convention of the 
aflcio the american trade union federation 
bush in his remarks said lech walesa by your abiding faith 
and by the miracle of democracys new birth in your homeland you 
have come to personify the new breeze that is sweeping the world 
east and west the spiritual godfather of a new generation of 
democracy 
walesa and his fellow workers in a brave union called 
solidarity are shattering the communist hold on eastern europe 
said bush 
the iron curtain is fast becoming a rusted abandoned relic 
symbolizing a lost era and failed ideology he said 
and walesas example said the president was mirrored across 
asia when people power became a chant first heard in the 
philippines then in pakistan and south korea and yes even in 
tiananmen square where chinese students demonstrated last summer 
the president who has been criticized by democrats in congress 
for not doing enough to stimulate change in the soviet bloc 
pointedly welcomed lech walesa a man of freedom to the 
white house the house of freedom 
walesa returns to the white house on tuesday night for a private 
dinner with president bush 
on wednesday walesa addresses a joint session of congress the 
first foreigner without a government job to do so since the 
american revolutionary war hero the marquis de lafayette a 
frenchman spoke there in 1824 
addressing the canadian auto workers union on sunday walesa 
cautioned that if the west doesnt enthusiastically back polands 
economic recovery it risks a brutal crackdown on the reforms now 
sweeping eastern europe 
the bloody crushing of the prodemocracy movement in china last 
summer is an excellent example of what could happen when the 
economic and political reforms do not go hand in hand walesa 
said 
after leaving washington on thursday walesa was to visit new 
york chicago philadelphia and caracas venezuela 
his visit is sponsored by the aflcio which has backed 
solidarity since it was founded in august 1980 as the first 
independent trade union in the soviet bloc walesa was to address 
an aflcio convention on tuesday 
walesa left poland on friday the day after the opening of the 
berlin wall the most striking symbol of soviet domination of 
eastern europe 
he first rocketed to international fame nine years ago climbing 
over another wall that surrounding the gdansk shipyard to lead 
the strike that forged solidarity nine years ago

prime minister benazir bhuttos 
cabinet offered monday to resign to open the way for a government 
reshuffle after a noconfidence vote came close to toppling her 
governing party officials said 
government sources said the offer was mainly a formality but 
that several advisers and special assistants were likely to go 
i will make changes in the cabinet at a suitable time ms 
bhutto was quoted as saying by pakistans state television 
sources said the move was a response to criticism that the prime 
minister during 11 months in power has surrounded herself with 
officials who have alienated her from her own pakistan peoples 
party 
earlier monday a dozen lowerlevel appointees resigned from 
posts in national security political affairs and finance the 
source said ms bhutto was expected to accept all 12 resignations 
but some of the appointees might be reassigned to other government 
posts 
ms bhutto promised changes in her leftleaning government 
following a parliamentary noconfidence motion on nov 1 the 
motion fell just 12 votes short of a majority in the 237seat 
national assembly 
the mainly rightwing opposition accused the government of 
ineffectiveness and cronyism 
apparently shaken by the close call ms bhutto 36 said she 
would purge her government of controversial figures and reach out 
to what she termed moderate elements of the mainly rightwing 
political opposition 
the pakistan peoples party emerged as the nations single 
largest party last november in pakistans first free elections 
after 11 years of military rule under late president gen mohammad 
zia ulhaq 
zia who overthrew ms bhuttos father in 1977 and had him 
hanged two years later died in a plane crash in august 1988 
ms bhuttos party claims about 111 seats in the federal 
legislature but rules mainly with the help of independents

secretary of state james a baker iii accused 
the soviet union on monday of supporting violence destruction 
and war in central america and he said these activities are the 
biggest obstacle to genuine superpower accommodation 
in a speech to foreign ministers of the organization of american 
states baker also said the united states will never accommodate 
itself to the outlaw regime in panama and he called for the 
international community to isolate that country 
panamanian foreign minister leonardo kam responded immediately 
calling us policies toward his country fascist 
bakers remarks on the soviet union reinforced the notion that 
central america may be the most divisive issue when president bush 
and soviet president mikhail gorbachev have their mediterranean 
summit in three weeks 
the soviet union bears a special responsibility because its 
arms and money moving through cuba and nicaragua continue to 
support violence destruction and war baker said 
he said shipments of soviet weapons to leftist rebels in el 
salvador are incompatible with the new thinking in moscow the 
term gorbachev uses to describe his break with past policy 
soviet behavior toward cuba and central america remains the 
biggest obstacle to a full acrosstheboard improvement with the 
united states and the soviet union 
baker said the united states would be pleased to have normal 
relations with a democratic panama but he said there is a 
dictator and his name is gen manuel antonio noriega he added 
that after the release monday of an oas report critical of panama 
no self respecting democracy should make an accommodation with 
that country 
after bakers remarks kam said the us diplomat was resorting 
to a very old formula a fascist one of repeating time and 
again false words so that they could ring true he said panama 
was a victim of relentless us aggression 
until baker spoke the mood at the meeting was upbeat with 
speaker after speaker hailing the entry of canada as the 32nd 
member of the oas about 25 foreign ministers were on hand for the 
opening day deliberations 
costa rica introduced a resolution calling on all oas member 
states to withraw their ambassadors from panama until a process is 
under way there to restore democracy 
the interamerican commission on human rights an oas agency 
said in its report on panama that the panamanian government 
routinely violates the rights of its citizens to among other 
things life humane treatment personal liberty and judicial 
guarantees 
the commission called on panama to take immediate steps to 
control the excessive violence that the defense force police and 
paramilitary groups employ against the civilian population 
these forces the report said must end the mistreatment 
torture and other cruel and inhuman and degrading treatment that 
the defense forces inflict upon individuals deprived of their 
freedom 
an oas effort to try to arrange a democratic transfer of power 
in panama was suspended in late august after it became apparent 
that noriega was not interested in surrendering power 
a separate oas report on nicaragua demands the release of all 
political prisoners and says that there are no guarantees the feb 
25 national elections there will be free and fair because of 
builtin advantages enjoyed by the incumbent sandinistas 
the renewed fighting in el salvador prompted nicaraguan foreign 
minister miguel descoto to introduce a resolution calling on the 
oas to make an urgent appeal to the government of el salvador to 
cease immediately the bombing of the civilian population 
shortly before the afternoon session was convened a delegation 
of sandinista and nicaraguan contra officials met at an oas annex 
several blocks away the talks are a continuation of discussions 
begun last thursday at the united nations 
the objective is to reach agreement restoring the cease fire and 
to lay the groundwork for the demobilization of the contras 
a number of oas countries have expressed support for the 
readmission of cuba to the oas after a 27year absence 
cuba has said it is ready to accept an oas invitation but 
diplomats said that issue was not likely to come up at this years 
meeting 
the united states has lobbied hard against cubas readmission 
citing alleged cuban support for subversion in central america and 
reported human rights abuses

of the colombianborn police officer charged with two counts of 
manslaughter in the jan 16 deaths of the motorcyclist and his 
passenger the killings set off three days of racial violence in 
miamis black neighborhoods 
the threejudge appeals panel had stayed the trial while it 
considered the issue the court could have decided to throw out the 
entire jury pool following previous appellate court decisions 
the defense had strenuously denied challenging the black juror 
ezra simmons because of his race noting they had already accepted 
another black juror on the sixmember panel the jury consists of 
two blacks one hispanic and three nonhispanic whites

a farm couple who hired drifters to buy 
cattle was charged monday with killing three former employees whose 
bodies were found in northern missouri barns last month 
attorney general william webster announced the filing of 
firstdegree murder charges against ray copeland 75 of 
mooresville and his wife faye 68 at a news conference at the 
livingston county jail 
the copelands have been held in the jail since oct 9 on charges 
of conspiracy to steal cattle with bad checks from an account set 
up for an employee the conspiracy charge was dismissed monday but 
neither webster nor prosecuting attorney doug roberts would say why 
webster said the decision to seek the death penalty was based on 
allegations that the victims were killed for money and to cover up 
another crime 
the copelands were not charged monday in the death of a fourth 
man whose body was found in another barn more than a week later 
webster said medical examiners are reviewing evidence in that case 
copeland wearing a bright orange countyissued jumpsuit was 
silent and showed no emotion at his hearing his bond was set at 
500000 
mrs copeland wearing a blue slicker and orange jail pants 
also was held under 500000 bond she cried during her hearing and 
tried to make a statement before her lawyer advised her not to say 
anything 
a search for bodies started oct 9 after a former employee 
alerted authorities that he had seen a human skull and leg bone at 
the copeland farm 
bloodhounds and backhoes were used for a week at the copelands 
40acre farm near mooresville 90 miles northeast of kansas city 
some evidence weapons and papers was found but no bodies were 
unearthed 
meanwhile the north central missouri major case squad a team 
of 20 officers from nine counties was activated oct 13 to assist 
in the search which was expanded to other farms in the area 
the decomposed bodies of three men were discovered three days 
later in shallow graves in a barn near ludlow the barn is on a 
farm about 12 miles south of copelands place where copeland had 
done odd jobs for several years 
each of the men paul j cowart 21 of dardanelle ark john 
w freeman 27 of tulsa okla and jimmie dale harvey 27 of 
springfield mo had been shot in the head the charges filed 
monday stem from their deaths 
the three victims had ties to a springfield mission where 
copeland sometimes showed up to hire transients 
a fourth decomposed body was found oct 25 in a barn about three 
miles away where copeland also had done odd jobs for several years 
the man also killed by a gunshot to the head has not been 
identified

the copelands since 1986 nine of them remain unaccounted for 
although digging has been halted and the major case squad disbanded 
sheriff leland odell said monday that authorities have searched 
about 100 sites 
documents on the theft conspiracy charge in livingston county 
circuit court say the copelands intended to use a 57yearold 
transient to buy cattle in august with bad checks then sell the 
cattle and retain the proceeds they opened a checking account and

a lender on department of housing and urban 
development probation amid allegations it inflated mortgages to pad 
its fees filed suit against the agency on monday 
the plaintiff benton mortgage co of knoxville tenn alleged 
that shoddy auditing led to the charges and that hud refuses to 
give the company a chance to rebut them 
the lawsuit filed in us district court contended that 
department auditors violated auditing standards and violated 
their duty to report accurately and fairly the findings of their 
own investigation when they issued a report accusing the company 
of inflating mortgages for more than a dozen projects 
a second suit filed by benton seeks a court order forcing hud to 
give its final endorsement to two bentonfinanced projects that are 
completed but have not received final clearance for financing in 
huds coinsurance program 
the projects are the 352unit pebble creek apartments in 
arlington texas and the 312unit kingsley park apartments in 
essex md 
that program is one of several criticized by internal and 
congressional investigators during recent investigations of 
mismanagement and influencepeddling at the department during the 
reagan administration 
benton was the coinsuring lender on a number of housing 
projects that also participated in the moderate rehabilitation 
program which auditors determined was riddled with influence 
peddling involving former agency officials and prominent 
republicans 
the audit of benton that led to its being placed on probation 
alleged that benton had approved inflated mortgages on 14 projects 
reviewed by the auditors allegedly allowing benton to reap higher 
fees and developers of the projects to receive excessive rent 
subsidies because those payments are based on the mortgage amount 
justice department investigators have reviewed the audit and the 
working papers used to compile it but have declined comment on the 
investigation 
hud spokesman william glavin said the department had no comment 
on bentons lawsuits 
benton chairman fred benton said in a statement that all of the 
projects cited in the audit had been approved by officials in the 
department he complained that the department has ignored repeated 
requests for a meeting to discuss the allegations 
it seems as if hud just doesnt want to deal with the fact 
that the audit findings are incorrect benton said apparently 
hud was fishing for scapegoats

an evenly divided supreme court cleared the 
way monday for the partial merger of detroits two daily newspapers 
in its first ruling on a 1970 law aimed at saving failing 
newspapers 
but opponents of the deal said the 44 vote suggests such joint 
operating agreements are on shaky ground they vowed to fight to 
restrain future mergers in any of the remaining two dozen or so 
cities with competing dailies 
the high court split affirmed a lower court ruling that former 
attorney general edwin meese iii acted reasonably last year when he 
approved plans by the detroit free press and the detroit news to 
merge their business production and advertising staffs but 
maintain editorial independence 
the federal newspaper preservation act of 1970 authorizes the 
attorney general to give financially failing newspapers an 
exemption from federal antitrust laws 
justice byron r white removed himself from the case for 
unexplained personal reasons the remaining eight justices 
announced their ruling in a terse statement that did not reveal how 
each voted 
the future of such newspaper mergers is really on eggshells 
said a leading opponent of the detroit agreement w edward 
wendover publisher and editor of the community crier of plymouth 
in suburban detroit 
so i think the focus of our opposition now switches to 
capitol hill he said 
supporters of the detroit agreement said the papers will remain 
editorially if not financially competitive 
were joined at the wallet but not at the heart said free 
press reporter joe swickard 
were very happy that the last hurdle has finally been 
crossed said sheila gibbons a spokeswoman for gannett co inc 
owner of the detroit news with the history of the two 
newspapers im sure you will continue to see heavy competition 
people are happy glad its over said robert j hall 
publisher and chairman of the free press but weve been through 
this before and there is probably still some degree of hesitation 
and disbelief 
the combination will become effective nov 27 with the first 
joint saturday paper on dec 2 and the first joint sunday paper the 
following day said william keating president of the joint 
operating entity the detroit newspaper agency 
under a 100year agreement the detroit newspapers will combine 
their business advertising and production departments but maintain 
separate editorial staffs 
the news will receive 55 percent of the merged companys profits 
during the first year dropping to 50 percent by the seventh year 
and thereafter 
the 44 vote by the justices leaves in doubt how the court would 
treat future newspaper agreements with white presumably the 
controlling vote 
gannett is the nations largest newspaper publishing group 
knightridder inc owner of the free press is the second largest 
they proposed the partial merger in 1986 
opponents of the deal calling themselves michigan citizens for 
an independent press contend that the free press is not a failing 
newspaper even though it lost 10 million a year between 1981 and 
1986 
the opponents say the free press and the news which lost 50 
million in the same period were unprofitable solely because both 
papers cut prices in an unsuccessful effort to force each other out 
of business 
knightridders lawyers had said the free press would be shut 
down if the joint operating agreement did not go through but an 
investor group from michigan recently offered to buy the newspaper 
for 68 million 
the newspapers have said that the agreement will eliminate some 
500 jobs they said closing the free press would have eliminated 
2200 jobs 
the justices were urged by the bush administration to uphold the 
partial merger to protect the dwindling number of twonewspaper 
cities in the united states 
but opponents of the deal said such a ruling would be a 
terrific incentive for monopoly conduct by competing papers 
giving them a blueprint on how to force approval of a joint 
operating agreement 
a federal appeals court panel here last year voted 21 to uphold 
meeses decision the full appeals court split 54 in refusing to 
review the threejudge panels rulings

the senate reached bipartisan compromise 
monday on a 738 million aid plan for poland and hungary two days 
before solidarity leader lech walesa is to address a joint meeting 
of congress 
the compromise ends a long and divisive battle over the proper 
scale of aid to poland and incorporates safeguards sought by 
republicans to make sure the money doesnt go to communist 
governments 
senate democrats originally had sought a threeyear spending 
level for the two east european nations of 989 millions while 
republicans sought a 585 million authorization level 
the agreement is expected to pass the senate on tuesday and 
must be reconciled with a slightly different house version 
the heart of the compromise aid bill the establishment of an 
enterprise fund to help both countries establish freemarket 
systems allocates 260 million for poland and 65 million for 
hungary overall the bill recognizing polands serious economic 
problems would give that country 657 million over the threeyear 
period while hungary would receive 81 million 
earlier senate majority leader george mitchell urged president 
bush to go to berlin to hail the figurative and literal 
destruction of the berlin wall 
to acknowledge the tremendous significance of the symbolic 
destruction of the berlin wall and to give voice to the 
exhilaration felt by all americans i urge president bush to travel 
to west berlin mitchell said 
earlier monday presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said he 
could not foresee any set of circumstances at this moment that 
would induce bush to go to berlin 
in related action the senate unanimously approved a resolution 
welcoming the opening of the wall condemning it as a symbol of 
oppression and calling for its complete destruction 
mitchell said the president should react to events in east 
germany by quickly convening a meeting of the western allies to 
plan a unified and coordinated response to the tumultuous spin of 
events in eastern europe and its implications for the future 
the maine democrat urged bush to promptly suspend trade barriers 
against the soviet union and to reward soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs reform program by granting moscow observer status at 
international economic institutions 
the wall symbol of division between east and west has been 
dissolved by the east german peoples desire for change for 
freedom for control of their future mitchell said 
it has been 40 years since the west demonstrated its 
commitment to the citys freedom by helping break the blockade 
strangling berlin he said it would be fitting for the 
american president to travel there to underscore the american 
commitment to the freedom of berlin and our support for democratic 
reform in east germany 
mitchell also urged the president to give more urgency than ever 
to completing the talks underway in vienna on reductions in 
conventional forces 
he said success in the vienna talks can complement the reforms 
taking place in the east 
meanwhile house democratic leader richard a gephardt sharply 
scored bushs reaction to events in eastern europe saying even 
as the walls of the modern jericho come tumbling down we have a 
president who is inadequate to the moment 
the changes taking place in europe should galvanize our 
president into action gephardt said in remarks prepared for 
delivery to the democratic leadership council 
but at the very time freedom and democracy are receiving 
standing ovations in europe our president is sitting politely in 
the audience with little to say and even less to contribute 
gephardt said 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas noted democrats had 
dropped a 200 million credit stabilization plan for poland a plan 
he said republicans believed would be unworkable 
sen paul simon dill chief sponsor of the democratic aid 
plan said the compromise makes senate approval of the package on 
tuesday virtually certain 
the elevation of members of the solidarity trade union to 
leadership positions in the polish government precipitated events 
in east germany simon said 
east germany just couldnt stand there is isolation he said 
if we can succeed in poland in improving the standard of 
living and promoting freedom then east germany is not going to 
have that communist form of government very long simon said 
president bush had proposed a 455 million aid package for 
poland and hungary but dole indicated he will not oppose the 
compromise

the government is losing more than 300 
million a year because farmers are being paid too much to take 
highly erodible land out of production congressional investigators 
reported monday 
some farmers who enrolled land in the conservation reserve 
program are getting 200 percent to 300 percent more than the local 
cash rental rate because the agriculture department failed to set 
the payments through competitive bidding according to a general 
accounting office study 
the gao also faulted the agriculture department for failing to 
give priority to land that is the most prone to erosion or 
contributes the most to water contamination the report said 
while crp benefits are substantial the overall impact and 
effectiveness of the program could have been enhanced if usda had 
managed the program to address the full range of crp objectives 
instead of focusing on the need to enroll prescribed acerage 
amounts the report said 
the agriculture department says it is running the program in a 
costeffective and efficient manner to meet congress goal of 
idling up to 45 million acres by 1990 
the report is expected to fuel a growing debate over 
conservation program and environmental concerns as congress writes 
the nations next farm program in 1990 
congress set up the program in the 1985 farm bill to reduce soil 
erosion improve water quality and cut production of surplus 
commodities 
more than 28 million acres of land were enrolled in the program 
through december 1988 at a cost of 14 billion a year cutting 
soil erosion by 574 million tons a year the gao said 
about 17 million acres were planted to trees well short of 
congress goal of having at least 125 million acres planted to 
trees 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee said the program is part of the foundations of 
conservation policy in the upcoming 1990 farm bill 
but we must also take this opportunity to build on the crp to 
use it to improve water quality and address many of the other 
environmental problems we face said leahy who requested the 
study 
texas led the nation with about 37 million acres idled as of 
this summer followed by north dakota with 26 million and kansas 
with 25 million

from the kremlins sphere of influence according to reports by 
independent television news and press association britains

uncertainty even danger 
after noting the extent and speed of reforms in the soviet 
union poland hungary and east germany the prime minister 
declared the way in which we in the west respond to these 
historic changes could be crucial in determining their success

jeopardy strong emotions have been aroused on all sides by 
recent events the need now is to take a measured view of the way

communist leader harilaos florakis 
received a presidential mandate monday to try to form a government 
after both the conservatives and socialists failed 
it was expected florakis leader of the left and progress 
coalition also would be unable to arrange an alliance that would 
have a parliamentary majority extending greeces political 
stalemate indefinitely 
conservative leader constantine mitsotakis whose new democracy 
party won the most parliamentary seats in the nov 5 elections but 
missed a majority was the first to try to form a government 
he met with florakis and former socialist premier andreas 
papandreou last week but was unable to persuade either to join in a 
shortterm administration with his conservatives 
president christos sartzetakis then issued a threeday 
exploratory mandate to papandreou but the unsuccessful papandreou 
returned without a mandate monday 
if florakis cannot form a coalition sartzetakis will call the 
leaders of the three major parties to a meeting to try to form a 
joint administration 
if that should fail the president will call general elections 
which would be the third this year 
florakis has said the left and progress coalition supports a 
broadbased government but it has made tough conditions including 
the removal of us military bases from greece and the rejection of 
a us request for the extradition of a suspected palestinian 
terrorist 
new democracy seeks closer ties with the united states and is 
opposed to those conditions 
papandreou has said his socialists and the left and progress 
coalition are in almost total agreement but florakis rejected 
his proposal to form a government that would exclude new democracy 
in the nov 5 elections new democracy won 148 seats in the 
300member parliament papandreous panhellenic socialist movement 
won 128 seats and florakis coalition 21 two seats went to 
independents and one to an enviromentalist movement 
the environmentalists declared sunday they would not back 
papandreou 
a socialist alliance with left and progress with the support of 
the only leftist independent would control only 150 deputies one 
short of a majority 
the third independent represents a moslem minority in northern 
greece and has not been approached by any party 
elections in june also failed to give any party a majority and 
the conservatives and communists formed a shortterm alliance 
ending eight years of government by papandreous socialists 
that unusual alliance was formed mainly to investigate charges 
of corruption in connection with a banking scandal against 
papandreou 
papandreou and five of his ministers were indicted and are 
scheduled to be tried by special courts next year

president roh taewoo said monday he 
hopes changes in eastern europe will prompt communist north korea 
to open its closed society 
in his regular radio address roh said his efforts to improve 
relations with east bloc countries will at long last open the way 
to national reconciliation and unification by inducing north korea 
to come out into the world 
roh will visit hungary as well as britain france west germany 
and switzerland nov 20dec 2 he will be the first south korean 
president to visit a communist nation 
the two koreas have been bitter rivals since korea was divided 
in 1945 at the end of world war ii when soviet and us troops 
ended the japanese occupation 
the communist north invaded the south in 1950 triggering a 
threeyear war involving troops from china and the 16nation un 
command borders are now completely sealed off and guarded by 
hundreds of troops and each side punishes its citizens trying to 
cross the border without prior approval 
dialogue has been held on and off between the two koreas to help 
reduce tension but little progress has been made with each side 
insisting on its own initiatives 
in a statement monday south koreas unification ministry urged 
the north to carry out reforms and adopt changes in east europe 
we hope relations between the two koreas will develop to a stage 
at which residents are free to visit each other 
we expect the north to end confrontation with the south and 
make orderly and peaceful changes by protecting liberty and human 
rights the statement said 
the question of human rights and freedom in north korea was a 
main topic at a policy meeting monday of senior government and 
ruling party officials party leaders also urged the government to 
take a more flexible attitude in dealing with north korea to help 
the north become more open officials said

a multiracial coalition gained a 
substantial lead early tuesday as ballots were counted for the 
election of an assembly to lead namibia to independence from south 
africa 
the black nationalist group southwest africa peoples 
organization swapo which is expected to win was in second place 
with results from its strongholds still not counted 
taking the lead in the 10party race was the procapitalist 
democratic turnhalle alliance 
with 45 percent of the 660000 ballots tabulated the alliance 
had 134181 votes or 43 percent to swapos 108532 votes or 35 
percent 
the figures came from 21 of the territorys 23 districts 
leftist swapo was expected to capture the two populous northern 
districts still outstanding and surpass the alliance which favors 
a capitalist economy 
results from the two most populous districts windhoek and the 
northern region of ovambo were not expected until wednesday more 
than half the voters are from those two districts and the leftwing 
swapo was expected to do well in both 
about 95 percent of namibias registered voters cast ballots 
from tuesday through saturday to choose a 72member assembly that 
will draft namibias constitution 
the assembly also will declare namibian independence after 74 
years of rule by south africa 
swapo which fought a 23year guerrilla war against south 
africa was expected to receive the most votes but there were 
doubts it would receive the twothirds needed to write the 
constitution without consulting other parties 
the assembly seats will be allocated according to the proportion 
of votes won by each party 
the first two candidates to win assembly seats were swapo 
president sam nujoma and turnhalle alliance vice chairman mishake 
muyongo each the top candidate on their partys lists each 
assembly seat represents about 9200 votes 
officials said results would be announced districtbydistrict 
as they were totaled 
votes were counted at the fairgrounds in windhoek the capital 
territorial police and soldiers of a un monitoring force barred 
the public and press from the area 
after voting ended saturday night un special representative 
martti ahtisaari declared the balloting free and fair 
swapo on monday agreed the elections were free but said they had 
questions about the fairness they said some ballot boxes that 
arrived in windhoek did not have the un seal on them as required 
territorial election officials denied any irregularities 
south african foreign minister pik botha said sunday that his 
government will accept the results and is ready to work 
constructively with the future government of namibia 
he said the election ends the international dispute that has 
raged for more than 40 years and which aside from apartheid 
constituted the most important line of attack against south 
africa 
south africa captured the territory from germany in world war i 
and ruled it under a league of nations mandate subsequently 
rescinded by the united nations 
south africa refused un orders to release the territory of 
more than 13 million people until an agreement was signed in 
december which also provided for cuban troops to leave neighboring 
angola

prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightist likud 
bloc scored gains but failed to break the rival labor partys hold 
over the national trade union federation in elections billed as a 
referendum on shamirs peace plan 
shamir had hoped a strong showing would strengthen his hand as 
he heads for talks wednesday with president bush about israels 
demand that the plo be excluded from peace talks 
according to national television projections likud garnered 28 
percent of the vote compared to 22 percent four years ago in an 
institution that has historically been a labor party stronghold 
the leftleaning labor headed by vice premier shimon peres 
held onto its 55percent majority in the 15 millionmember 
histadrut labor federation meaning it still maintains control over 
the organization 
independent pollster hanoch smith predicted labor would gain 56 
percent of the votes and likud 27 percent 
labor claimed victory and one senior official said the results 
were tremendously encouraging a turning point in the partys 
morale 
but likud leaders pointed out they had loosened some of labors 
power base in the histadrut which governs israeli labor policy and 
also owns a significant chunk of israeli farms and industries 
the television said its projections were based on an exit poll 
of 7560 voters at 36 polling stations with a margin of error of 
two to three percent likud apparently gained from the losses of 
three smaller leftwing parties 
in past elections television projections have been accurate 
final results were expected tuesday morning 
a stronger position in the labor federation also would help 
shamir defend his shaky coalition government against threats by 
peres to resign over peace policy and demand new elections 
peres claimed his party had made a comeback after losing 
national elections to likud last year 
this shows the public has given renewed confidence to the 
labor party and we will reach new heights peres told the 
television labor favors making territorial concessions to the 
arabs for peace 
in the union elections 1494717 israelis about half the 
electorate were eligible to choose delegates to the histadrut 
conference 
shamir made daily campaign speeches around the country focusing 
on foreign policy and palestinian violence in the 23monthold 
uprising against israeli rule 
he warned repeatedly that talking to the palestine liberation 
organization or yielding any of the west bank or gaza strip to the 
arabs would be national suicide and urged support for his own 
peace plan introduced last april 
the usbacked israeli plan calls for holding elections in the 
disputed lands as part of an interim peace settlement arabs have 
balked at accepting the idea because they want the plo to represent 
them in negotiations 
likud and labor formed a coalition after inconclusive elections 
in 1984 and did the same last year when likud won one more seat 
than labor in the 120member parliament but neither won a majority 
histadrut the hebrew word for union was founded in 1920 and 
has continued to be labors domain despite the rise to power of 
likud in 1977 
most likud supporters favor a freemarket economy and shun the 
histadrut because of its socialist institutions

actions especially backing the contras rebels in nicaragua and 
being behind the star wars program

entered and left the university hall where the duchess of kent

the bush administration held out the prospect 
of steppedup trade and diplomatic ties with east germany on 
monday while top democrats in congress called for far more 
dramatic steps to signal support for the stunning reform 
developments in the communist world 
senate majority leader george mitchell urged president bush to 
travel to the berlin wall convene a meeting of the western allies 
and suspend trade barriers against the soviet union 
to acknowledge the tremendous significance of the symbolic 
destruction of the berlin wall and to give voice to the 
exhilaration felt by all americans i urge president bush to travel 
to west berlin said mitchell dmaine 
administration officials who declined to be identified said bush 
was considering the convocation of a nato summit in brussels after 
his saltwater summit meeting on dec 23 with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev to discuss new political and military 
strategy for the west 
one administration official flashed two less dramatic signals 
he said the administration might boost trade with east germany 
which totaled 220 million in 1988 and hold more frequent meetings 
with east german diplomats 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater hailed the glorious 
traffic of more than 1 million east germans streaming into west 
berlin to catch a glimpse of freedom but said concerning the 
possibility that bush might rush to the wall we cant foresee 
any set of circumstances at this moment that would induce him to 
go 
vice president dan quayle meanwhile said german reunification 
was inevitable 
east germany is east germany because of the communist 
system quayle told the republican governors association at 
hilton head island sc do away with the communist system and 
its germany 
but the caution shown by bush and secretary of state james a 
baker iii amid last weeks burst of new freedom in what was once a 
rigid stalinist state still permeated public and private statements 
by us policy makers 
the us government is not likely to take significant action 
until there are elections said one official youd have to 
see something like that happen before we would do something serious 
other than to send friendly signals to the east germans he said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
if you are talking about assistance like were giving to 
poland and hungary thats inappropriate the official said 
west germany to which the administration is deferring on most 
east german decisions is taking the same approach 
apart from holding elections the official cited three 
additional conditions for us help first is that the east germans 
do not backtrack on the announcement last thursday that 
restrictions on emigration and travel to the west had ended 
additionally he said east germany must settle claims against 
it by the jewish community that derive from germanys murder of 6 
million european jews during world war ii and also compensate 
americans whose property was seized by the postwar communist regime 
these amount to several hundred million dollars each the 
official said thats not a big thing but they are a big obstacle 
in our relationship 
quayle meanwhile rebutted democratic accusations that the bush 
administration was slow in responding to the change sweeping 
eastern and central europe he charged that the democrats havent 
offered one creative idea on how to manage the evolving situation 
in eastern europe or the soviet union except to criticize the 
president 
house democratic leader richard a gephardt renewed the 
criticism quayle was talking about saying at the very time 
freedom and democracy are receiving standing ovations in europe 
our president is sitting politely in the audience with little to 
say and even less to contribute 
separately a dozen liberal congressmen said the changes sweping 
eastern europe give the united states the chance to shift defense 
spending to domestic programs 
members of the group led by rep barney frank dmass told a 
news conference that the level of us spending and its military 
presence facing the soviet bloc can no longer be justified 
what you see emerging here is a coalition of people who want 
to talk about realities said rep george miller dcalif this 
is our opening shot and were going to be tough on the budget this 
year this is hardball politics 
while the quickening pace of change is pushing east germany onto 
the bushgorbachev agenda the white house and state department 
sought to dampen speculation the two leaders might settle the 
countrys future 
presidential spokesman fitzwater told reporters at the white 
house that we do not intend to have this emerge as a second 
yalta he referred to the black sea meeting in 1945 in which 
president franklin d roosevelt british prime minister winston 
churchill and soviet leader josef stalin deliberated on the postwar 
future of europe 
other us officials said bush would be prepared for an overture 
by gorbachev to consider the prospect of a reunified neutral 
germany but the officials stressed that moscow had not signaled 
through diplomatic channels that was the soviet leaders intention 
for the shipboard meetings with bush in the mediterranean 
in any event us policy on east germany is to act in concert 
with the west europeans rather than to take the lead especially on 
the reunification issue 
baker was in touch over the weekend with british and french 
officials and when vernon walters the us ambassador to west 
germany met sunday in bonn with soviet ambassador vyacheslav 
kochemasov he also represented britain and france said richard 
boucher the state department spokesman 
as the senate resumed debate on an aid package to poland and 
hungary just hours before the arrival of solidarity leader lech 
walesa democratic leader mitchell said a meeting of the western 
alliance is essential 
it is widely recognized there has begun a process of 
transforming the political economic and security arrangements on 
the european continent he said

been killed detained fled the country or joined the rebels 
human rights groups including amnesty international have 
accused barres government of human rights violations including 
torture indefinite detention without trial unfair trials and 
executions without trial 
one of the governments strongest opponents is the somali 
national movement of insurgents in the north who have been fighting 
for barres ouster since 1981 
the movement announced in a clandestine radio broadcast saturday 
that its fighters had cut the main road connecting northern somalia 
with the capital mogadishu

patriotic movement has in recent months been fighting government

600 million fouryear contract 
the nba is in the final season of a fouryear 173 million deal 
with cbs which refused to meet the leagues new pricetag 
the new pact was another example of the price escalation for tv 
sports and of the breakup of traditional alliances between leagues 
and networks baseball which had been on nbc since 1947 goes to 
cbs starting in 1990 under a fouryear 106 billion deal the 
olympics once a domain of abc will remain on nbc and cbs through 
at least 1994 
nbc which last broadcast the nba in 1962 lost its baseball 
package to cbs last december

under the contract nbc will show 20 regularseason games the 
allstar game and up to 30 playoff games

replace the twoyear 50 million deal with turner broadcasting

a commercial television station and a 
public tv station hope to introduce the first allnews station 
operated by local tv stations anywhere in the nation 
krontv the local nbc affiliate plans to launch the joint 
venture with public station kqed in march tentatively called the 
bay news center the allnews station would be broadcast on channel 
32 
the plan still must be approved by kqeds board of directors 
which is scheduled to vote dec 7 kqed president anthony tiano 
said kqed inc has broadcast licenses for channels 9 and 32 
a potential roadblock is an fcc review board ruling last year 
that denied kqed a renewal of its license to operate channel 32 
the ruling has been appealed to the full fcc 
weve been looking for a way to get back into tv news said 
tiano whose station had a daily local newscast during the 1970s 
but recently canceled its only regularly scheduled local public 
affairs program 
kron owned by chronicle broadcasting co had been seeking 
since may to start a cable tv channel that focuses on regional 
news general manager amy mccombs said 
viewers without cable would see newscasts without commercials 
executives at kron and kqed said commercials would be added when 
the stations signal was received by a cable operator and 
distributed to subscribers homes

senators are preparing to decide an issue that 
touches some of americas most sensitive nerve endings should a 
member of a private club that bars women and minorities be 
confirmed as a federal judge 
the question is do organizations like the olympic club hurt 
people and it seems to me absolutely that they do professor 
stephen gillers of new york university school of law told the 
senate judiciary committee last week 
the question for the senate is whether to confirm san francisco 
attorney vaughn walker as a district court judge despite the fact 
that he has for 15 years belonged to that citys embattled olympic 
club long a bastion of white male dominance 
the club barred blacks from its rolls for decades and still 
refuses to admit women as full members

for a man who was tearing tickets at a west end 
theater just a few years ago 28yearold director tim luscombe is 
getting some impressive exposure 
he is shepherding two london hits to new york this season and 
will direct joan collins return to the london stage next year tom 
stoppards artist descending a staircase starts broadway 
performances nov 22 at the helen hayes theater for a nov 30 bow 
martin shermans when she danced follows offbroadway at 
playwrights horizons where performances begin jan 25 1990 
there is no point in being in this business if youre not 
directing plays you actually adore and have a real feeling for 
said luscombe an oxford university graduate 
the pressured broadway environment couldnt be more different 
from the relaxed intimacy of the kings head the north london pub 
theater where these productions originated 
but luscombe said higher stakes dont daunt him if i started 
thinking oh god what does a broadway audience want from this 
scene i would just go bananas 
i cant ever think in terms of an audience i do it for me 
the more you trust your instincts the more successful you will be 
also how do i know what a broadway audience wants ive seen five 
shows on broadway entirely musicals 
broadway has traditionally warmed to stoppard the czechborn 
master of wordplay who won tony awards for travesties 
rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead and the real thing 
his screenplays include empire of the sun brazil and 
john le carres the russia house now in production 
artist descending a staircase began as a radio play in 1972 
written in 11 scenes covering 58 years the play is organized 
symmetrically around scene 6 so that the action goes backward to 
1914 only to reverse directions and end up where it started 
its about three aging artists played by john mcmartin paxton 
whitehead and harold gould who decades earlier fought for the 
affections of a young blind girl stephanie roth 
its punning stoppardian title pays homage to nude descending a 
staircase marcel duchamps 191112 dadaist painting which like 
stoppards brief 80minute play is an exercise in perspective 
luscombe said it was a difficult play to do but its like a 
poem its as beautiful and as taut as a poem 
he first read the play as a set text for his high school art 
studies i believe it saved my exam it inspired me hugely 
when he set out to stage it he tried changing the radio format 
but ended up going back to the original and didnt change a word 
people seemed to think it was as good a theater piece as it 
was a radio piece luscombe said 
he said the play has an emotional directness not always found in 
stoppard whose latest london play hapgood was dismissed by 
some as cold and obscure 
it has more to do with the heart than with the head he 
said it is an intensely passionate piece 
when she danced his other new york play marks the first 
time the esteemed nonprofit theater playwrights horizons has 
employed a foreign director luscombe said 
the play set in paris late in the career of dancer isadora 
duncan is by martin sherman the londonbased american author of 
bent and messiah 
luscombe grew up in the south london suburbs and after oxford 
spent a year teaching at a north london boys school he quit to 
work in a theater box office and tear tickets then studied 
directing at the bristol old vic theater school 
he made his london reputation staging 20thcentury english 
classics such as noel cowards littleknown easy virtue and 
terence rattigans the browning version 
next autumn he returns to the west end to stage cowards 1930 
private lives with joan collins of tvs dynasty as the 
elegantly barbed amanda 
he regards coward who died in 1973 as britains chekhov and 
says of collins return to the boards shell be wonderful

while communist leaders 
elsewhere are grappling with public discontent the outlawed south 
african communist party is gaining wide notice and unabashed 
support 
because of president fw de klerks decision to ease 
restrictions on antigovernment protest the communists symbols 
and rhetoric have emerged from the political underground into the 
media spotlight 
at a mass rally in october for freed leaders of the african 
national congress guerrilla movement the communist partys red 
flag and the ancs gold green and black banner were given equal 
prominence as huge backdrops to the speakers podium 
a roar came from the mostly black crowd of more than 70000 when 
a message was read from the partys general secretary joe slovo 
an exiled white lawyer who is depicted by the government as a 
mastermind of terrorist attacks the rallys keynote speech 
delivered by the 77yearold anc leader walter sisulu ended with 
an unmistakable message 
long live the anc long live our alliance with the south 
african communist party long live the working class movement 
the partys new stature comes at a time when its counterparts 
are in varying degrees of retreat not only in eastern europe but 
also in africa the trend among leftist governments on the 
continent is to move away from dogmatic marxismleninism and seek 
expanded economic ties with the west 
but in south africa communism holds a particular appeal for 
sections of the disenfranchised black majority who view capitalism 
as a partner of apartheid 
the party has not issued a detailed platform on how it would run 
the country however it has never publicly repudiated any aspect 
of orthodox marxismleninism and refers to western countries as 
imperialist 
the communist party retains a romantic mystique to the 
young lions who are searching for a revolutionary alternative to 
the status quo the weekly mail an antiapartheid newspaper 
said in a recent analysis it has a vision and an ideological 
coherence 
some commentators have suggested that this mystique could be 
lessened if the government lifted the ban on the party and let its 
leaders compete openly in the ideological marketplace as yet 
there has been no sign this might happen 
let me state it unequivocally said law and order minister 
adriaan vlok in a speech nov 2 communism is unacceptable to me 
it is unacceptable to the south african government and the large 
majority of people in our country 
some antiapartheid church leaders have expressed dismay that 
communist banners were displayed at recent protest marches they had 
led yet many activist clergymen discomfited by communisms atheism 
are sympathetic to the anc which uses as its anthem a moving hymn 
god bless africa 
the anccommunist alliance dates to the early 1920s when both 
campaigned for black workers the communist party was banned in 
1950 and the anc in 1960 and leaderhip has overlapped extensively 
within the two exiled organizations 
in 1986 the us state department estimated that about half of 
the ancs executive committee members were communists 
govan mbeki one of the released anc leaders honored at the 
october rally said in his speech that the anccommunist alliance 
has been a prime target of the south african government and its 
supporters in the imperialist countries 
he declared that the alliance is going to continue until 
apartheid is eliminated 
few details about the communist party including its size and 
the composition of its politburo are known the anc operates 
clandestinely inside south africa and its guerrillas periodically 
are arrested but no evidence has turne up of comparable internal 
activity by the communists 
the most recent policy statement issued by the party takes a 
more hardline stance than the anc on the possibility of 
negotiations with the government 
seizure of power will be the product of escalating and 
progressively merging mass political and military struggle with 
the likelihood of culminating in an insurrection said a document 
adopted at a party congress earlier this year we are not engaged 
in a struggle whose objective is merely to generate sufficient 
pressure to bring the other side to the bargaining table

under the presidency of julio m 
sanguinetti uruguays economy expanded its employment rate 
increased and workers wages have risen yet as he prepares to 
leave office his popularity is at an alltime low and the main 
opposition party is poised for victory in the presidential election 
this sunday 
there is a great sense of dissatisfaction in the country 
the political analyst and pollster luis gonzalez said if you 
compare uruguay with argentina or brazil uruguay has done well 
but that doesnt satisfy uruguayans 
sanguinetti however feels a sense of accomplishment 
i think many things were done he said in an interview 
above all a descent into the bad things that characterize these 
times on this continent was avoided 
since he took office in march 1985 sanguinetti has watched 
neighboring brazil sink deep into foreign debt venezuela face 
riots argentina almost collapse under hyperinflation and peru 
bleed in a guerrilla insurgency 
uruguay with a population of just 29 million has not been 
free of the ills that plague its neighbors but never did problems 
overwhelm resources undermine democracy or touch off violence 
i would say yes the country is better after sanguinetti 
said jorge lanzara director of the political science faculty at 
the university of the republic 
sanguinettis critics say his economic gains shine only in 
comparison with the recession of the early 1980s his supporters 
say he was kept from doing better by opposition in congress 
he provided peace democracy and some economic growth said 
gladys presa 59 i say thank you dr sanguinetti in my 
opinion he did a very good job 
the polling agency equipos consultores recently gauged 
sanguinettis public approval rating at 22 percent down from a 
high four years ago of nearly 70 percent 
equipos consultores and the gallup organization both project 
that luis lacalle of the opposition national party will defeat 
jorge batlle of sanguinettis colorado party in the balloting 
sanguinetti a 53yearold attorney and career politician 
professes to be disturbed neither by the polls nor by labor unrest 
that has resulted in strikes by teachers garbage collectors dock 
workers and other public employees in recent weeks 
politics is not a thing of momentary popularity he said 
the main criticism they make of me is that i limited myself to 
being the administrator of a crisis that i was not a reformer 
well i accept that 
political observers say sanguinettis accomplishments fell short 
of public expectations because the economic improvements came 
nowhere near to restoring the prosperity uruguay had from the turn 
of the century through the 1950s the years when it was known as 
the switzerland of south america 
public services that once were run with exceptional efficiency 
now function poorly classrooms are overcrowded teachers are 
underpaid hospitals and clinics are outdated and retirement 
pensions are paltry 
critics describe sanguinettis treatment of opposition parties 
in congress as highhanded his support of amnesty for former 
military rulers as overly aggressive and his backing of vice 
president enrique tarigo over batlle in the colorado presidential 
primary as meddling 
he didnt make any mistakes until he said publicly he made no 
mistakes lanzara said then he lost the colorado primary 
there is a certain arrogance in him he thought if he told batlle 
not to run he wouldnt 
even political opponents concede however that any accounting 
of sanguinettis term must note he is honest hardworking 
intelligent and eloquent 
i believe he is the best of american presidents north or 
south lacalle was quoted as saying in a published interview 
sanguinetti is barred by the constitution from seeking a 
consecutive term while he refuses to speculate whether hell run 
again in 1994 the assumption is that he will

earthquakes in the past disfigured one of 
ramses iis colossal faces at abu simbel in southern egypt toppled 
alexandrias pharos lighthouse and destroyed some of cairos most 
beautiful mosques 
but theyve failed to faze the oldest of the great monuments 
the giza pyramids or so far the newest gamal abdul nassers 
aswan high dam which began operating in 1971 
in october when the killer earthquake struck northern 
california followed by another closer to home in algeria 
egyptians began to worry about the high dams safety 
seventeen times the size of cheops great pyramid the 
sovietbuilt aswan is the worlds largest rockfilled dam and it 
holds back the worlds second largest manmade lake 310milelong 
lake nasser 
a serious breach of the dam would send a huge wall of water an 
estimated 110 billion gallons roaring through the nile river 
valley where almost all egypts 55 million people live 
rushing toward the mediterranean sea it would sweep away much 
of ancient and modern egypt and reach cairo in three days 
when im asked if the aswan high dam is safe from earthquakes 
i can say it is up to magnitude 7 on the richter scale because 
weve made a mockup of the dam and tested it said geophysicist 
rm kebeasy egypts leading dam expert 
even if an earthquake were to occur beneath the dam itself it 
would withstand it to this level still were taking no chances 
we monitor seismic activity 24 hours a day 
on nov 14 1981 a 56 quake centered 40 miles to the south of 
the dam and a series of aftershocks startled aswans residents 
it was the strongest in living memory at aswan and all of egypt 
shared aswans concern 
even though this earthquake was not a major concern for us we 
took earthquakes seriously from that time kebeasy said within 
months egypt had its first seismic station at aswan equipped with 
ussupplied equipment and advisers 
pressure on the dam and the surrounding geology is daunting 
every year for eons an estimated 134 million tons of sediment 
made its way down the nile to the sea now it is captured behind 
the dam adding that much more weight to the lakebed 
water levels and pressure shift constantly accommodating 
differences in wind direction flow northward from sudan 
temperature and other factors 
kebeasy said geologists werent at all surprised when 
earthquakes started occurring as the lake began to fill 
we thought the largest ones would appear when water is 
highest he said they dont the strongest ones coincide with 
drought 
he predicts that earthquake activity will diminish as the dam 
area conditions itself to its new geological feature a huge lake 
but other experts such as boston universitys egyptianborn 
farouk elbaz advise caution 
you have an immense weight of water and you have water 
seeping through faults acting as a lubricant he said people 
should neither sit around worrying about it nor forget it you have 
to be on the alert 
an early critic of the dam was geologist farkhonda hassan a 
former member of parliament now a professor at american university 
in cairo 
she and others still question whether the aswan earthquakes are 
caused by the weight of the lake or more dangerously by faults 
like the san andreas that caused the california quake that measured 
71 
the dam was built she noted in nassers time 
you couldnt criticize if you did you were branded a bad 
egyptian she added 
there were scientists in egypt willing and able to do indepth 
geological surveys of the area but we werent included 
i believe the dam would have been built anyway but i would 
like to have seen it built with more science

london is undergoing its biggest transformation 
since it climbed out of the rubble of world war ii 
from the east end and kings cross to the westerly thamesside 
districts of chelsea fulham and putney vast tracts of the capital 
are changing as the postindustrial age overtakes britain 
when a man is tired of london he is tired of life dr 
samuel johnson once wrote but today the great 18th century 
wordsmith might have trouble finding his way around his house off 
fleet street still stands but otherwise in a sense londons very 
center of gravity is shifting 
fleet street is no longer the main street for newspaper offices 
covent garden where eliza doolittle sold her flowers is a chic 
modern shopping and eating mall the once seedy east end and 
hackney are becoming yuppie country soho is losing its strip 
joints and going classy 
the 121mile orbital the worlds longest beltway was completed 
three years ago and is opening up new suburbs for londoners who can 
no longer afford skyrocketing house prices 
at the same time the nostalgia boom is bringing back 
suburbanites to the inner cities in search of old georgian and 
victorian properties to refurbish and diy doityourself is 
britains biggest hobby after tvgazing 
the docklands once the worlds largest shipping hub is now 
europes biggest urban renewal project although struggling with 
traffic and startup problems rundown kings cross in the heart of 
the capital will soon get a similar facelift with the bulldozing of 
135 acres of decayed georgian and victorian buildings railroad 
sidings and warehouses 
kings cross may become the terminus of the rail tunnel being 
dug to link britain and france and highspeed trains thundering up 
from the english channel promise yet more profound change for 
london 
the entrepreneurial forces unleashed by a decade of government 
by prime minister margaret thatcher and her conservatives are 
evident in this flower of cities all as the 16th century poet 
william dunbar called it 
theres a fantastic amount of money about after 10 years of 
mrs thatchers enterprise culture and lots more has come to london 
from abroad because developers consider britain a safe bet said 
realtor joss macleod 
thatcherism is reflected in the lifestyle he added 
london is hotting up in all walks of life its faster now the 
english reserve has been replaced in part by a lot more energy and 
drive and its driven a lot of londoners into the country 
there is also a growing homelessness problem the government 
puts the number at 23000 shelter a charity puts the number 
nearer 40000 
some things of course never change big ben still keeping 
time precisely taxi drivers who can still refuse to go beyond 
the sixmile limit set in victorian times to spare the horses 
londons three royal palaces five great parks and timeless 
landmarks such as st pauls cathedral and nelsons column 
its still a quiet goodnatured city where the emphasis is on 
community and children do most things at halfprice at night 
london retires to pubs or clubs empties out into its suburbs goes 
to bed early and eschews ostentation no 10 downing st the prime 
ministers address is just an ordinary door with a policeman 
outside 
the development boom uncovers extraordinary relics the 
foundations of william shakespeares globe and rose theaters at 
southwark prehistoric flints and arrowheads by waterloo train 
station a saxon settlement under the strand a tudor workmans hat 
near london bridge 
london has a population of 67 million plus 21 million tourists 
a year but no mayor indeed the city of london means no more than 
the business district which has a figurehead lord mayor whose writ 
doesnt run outside its square mile 
the rest of the capital is the sum of its 32 boroughs each 
independent with no overarching authority to solve critical 
problems of traffic congestion and litter 
the leftled greater london council was abolished in 1986 as 
part of mrs thatchers crusade against socialism and now london 
looks out of control says judy hillman an urban affairs 
consultant and author of a new look for london its 
divide and rule with 33 fiefdoms and no forum for debating 
londonwide issues 
fleet street until a few years ago synonymous with newspapers 
is deader than yesterdays headline now that publishers have moved 
to new hightech facilities in the docklands and elsewhere

in the city imposing victorian counting houses jostle against 
ultramodern architecture such as the glassandtube headquarters 
of the lloyds insurance market 
the great shopping boulevard of oxford street still attracts 
shoppers from all over the world but canny londoners now head for 
the new americanstyle malls like brent cross in north london with 
its thousands of free parking spaces 
harry shepherd 66 who heads the storekeepers oxford street 
association grew up in londons east end when it was poor and 
tough and regrets the decline of londons community spirit 
its because society itself has changed and become more 
selfish he said one example is the way crowds on the tube 
subway no longer stand aside to allow passengers to get off 
the subway system the worlds largest is so crowded that it is 
raising fares to reduce passenger loads meaning more automobiles 
clogging a road system so resistant to expansion that village lanes 
become major thoroughfares 
the real estate frenzy means rocketing land prices and rents 
with houses in mayfair belgravia and hampstead fetching up to 47 
million 
the center and the wellknown areas like chelsea and 
knightsbridge have become too expensive for anyone unless they 
belong to the international network said miss hillman 
londoners used to move very little now they are moving 
everywhere 
on savile row where the wellheeled get their suits at 1000 
pounds 1500 apiece tailors have been deprived of their 
lightindustry status exposing them to crippling rent hikes 
the unsentimental thatcher government has told the tailors to 
adapt to market forces or go to hounslow a suburb 11 miles 
away 
the sex shops and massage parlors of once seedy but fascinating 
soho are being replaced by smart restaurants shops and designer 
offices gerard street is the hub of a thriving chinatown with 
allnight eating houses nearby the west end offers its endless 
outpouring of musicals and quality drama 
some london traditionalists dislike the changes prince charles 
among them 
the heir to the throne and selfappointed arbiter of british 
architectural taste accuses postwar developers of doing more damage 
to london than hitlers air force 
the writer and jazz singer george melly writing in the guardian 
newspaper dismisses the current postmodernist school of 
architecture as strip lighting and flickering computers visible 
through the sash windows of a fake georgian facade 
in the soho he once loved advertising agents creatures of 
the media have ousted the painters poets and eccentrics of my 
salad days he wrote 
a lot of london character is being priced out by chain stores 
but asian immigrants have rescued the news vending candy and 
greengrocery trades 
london is a much more cosmopolitan city these days miss 
hillman said whitechapel which was jewish immigrant is now 
bengali from bangladesh brixton brent and harringay are 
afrocaribbean and so are bits of notting hill southall is indian 
and newham is asian

less pollution more garbage and the decline of 
heavy industry have brought wildlife to london 
squirrels abound in the parks perching on trash cans at marble 
arch to munch discarded sandwiches and lick candy papers 
crows strut in hyde park contesting for fast food remnants with 
the squirrels pigeons blackbirds and sparrows 
salmon migrating from the sea were caught in the thames this 
year a tribute to two decades of pollution control 
foxes have moved in rearing cubs on railroad embankments and 
in derelict basements and finding food in streets and backyards 
says jeff edwards conservation officer at the london wildlife 
trust 
one of londons glories is its parks and wild open spaces its 
also a gardeners city in which almost every home has its green 
backyard 
turning up in the unlikeliest inner city corners are the 
ubiquitous allotments small patches of land distributed to 
retirees to raise vegetables and flowers its a vestige of world 
war ii when the british were commanded to grow food on every 
possible square foot of their island 
edwards said the 1956 clean air act prompted by killer smog 
stopped coal fires being burned in homes cleaned the air and 
improved the prospects for wildlife although increased traffic 
cancels out some of the gains 
kestrels are nesting in high places and preying on sparrows 
where they used to eat small rodents in the country magpies were 
once seen only in the country but are nesting in trees in the 
streets and pinching the eggs of smaller birds as well as 
scavenging 
wildlife cant survive in bits of formal parkland it needs 
wild places as well he said 
a prime example is camley street in kings cross where 
volunteers cleared derelict land dug ponds and then left nature to 
create a remarkable patch of the wild in the midst of one of the 
capitals seediest districts 
it is wonderful for children in the heart of london to see 
frogs toads newts and minnows a few yards from a busy street 
edwards said 
but change has its price 
the camley street park is under threat from its landlord 
british rail which needs room to expand

the sorbonne established as a center of learning 
at a time when scholars risked being burned for sorcery has shown 
an uncanny knack for keeping its intellectual reputation despite 
200 years of decline 
sorbonne is a magic word everywhere in the world because of 
the tradition of intellectual excellence that it represents it is 
a symbol said its rector michelle gendreaumassaloux whose 
travels on behalf of the university have taken her recently to 
boston berlin and bombay 
president mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet union chose the 
sorbonnes amphitheater as the setting for meeting french 
intellectuals chinese exiles gathered there to organize a new 
movement for democracy millions of foreign visitors wouldnt 
consider a trip to paris complete without buying a sorbonne 
university sweatshirt sold by independent entrepreneurs 
but the reputation abroad is a long way from the reality at home 
top students regard todays sorbonne as seedy and secondrate 
and a wrong turn on the road to success in french government or 
industry 
the sorbonne founded more than 700 years ago and the other 
national universities are considered poor relations to the five 
grandes ecoles unabashedly elitist training grounds for the sons 
and daughters of the wellheeled 
students train and compete like olympic athletes for the 100000 
places available in the grandes ecoles unlike the staterun 
university system that accommodates more than 1 million students 
the grandes ecoles offer smaller classes better facilities and the 
sort of lifelong networking typical of oxford and cambridge in 
britain or americas ivy league 
onethird of the leaders of frances 50 biggest companies come 
from a single school the ecole polytechnique the cabinets of 
president francois mitterrand have been dominated by graduates of 
the ecole nationale dadministration including ms 
gendreaumassoloux who was mitterrands spokeswoman before taking 
the rectors job at the sorbonne 
the sorbonne and other state universities must accept anyone who 
has passed the difficult high school exit exam the 
baccelaureat and pays the annual tuition of 450 francs 73 
as a result the schools are overcrowded underfinanced and suffer 
a high dropout rate 
space is our biggest problem said ms gendreaumassaloux 
there are not enough tables or chairs even books we are 
bursting at the seams 
two thousand students stood in lines for hours this year hoping 
for one of the 1100 places available to study english and spanish 
seats are hard to find in the sorbonnes lofty library with the 
beamed neorenaissance ceilings benches are scarce in the central 
courtyard outside the sorbonne church erected in 1642 and 
containing the marble tomb of cardinal richelieu 
halls lavatories and public spaces in the fourstory building 
on the rue des ecoles are jammed more than 37000 students 
including 6000 foreigners fill beyond capacity the schools 22 
lecture halls two museums 16 examination halls 22 lecture rooms 
37 rooms for the teaching staff laboratories a library a physics 
tower an astronomy tower and offices 
faded allegorical murals the gilded sundial and the sweeping 
stairway at the entrance to the school may wow the tourists but 
french students are not impressed 
they ranked the sorbonne 18th on the list of 78 staterun 
schools judged on ambiance quality of instruction and job 
prospects in a poll conducted among 14500 students this past 
summer by the newspaper le monde 
sixty percent of the sorbonne students polled doubted their 
education would make it easier to find jobs 
the beginning of the decline that has led to this sorry state 
can be traced to the french revolution in 1789 when the school lost 
much of its status along with a precious library that was moved to 
the national archives 
napoleon dented the sorbonnes prestige by setting up his own 
school in the early 19th century latin ceased to be the official 
language of scholarship and more specialized schools for the elite 
opened their doors 
following the student riots of may 1968 the university of paris 
was reorganized into 13 miniuniversities financed and administered 
by the state the sorbonne building was allocated to house paris 
iii and iv schools of history arts and letters and foreign 
languages 
despite the changes in the school itself the surrounding left 
bank neighborhood remains the unchallenged domain of students 
in the sorbonnes early days nations of young scholars 
distinguished from each other by marks of provincial dress and 
accent strolled along the banks of the seine arguing logic or 
devising syllogisms 
there were scores of harddrinking english in furlined coats 
and leather hose brawling germans in toploftical fur hats 
burgundians brutal and thickheaded the native franks foppish 
and arrogant italians richly dressed in oriental stuffs 
wrote historian amy kelly the air of freedom prevailed all 
manner of instruction was provided 
at its founding in 1253 the sorbonne was just one of several 
schools allowed to open outside the confines and control of the 
roman catholic school at notre dame 
robert de sorbon a chaplain for king louis ix st louis 
received permission to set up his college for 16 poor theology 
students and it quickly gained an academic reputation that made it 
the tallest tree in the leafy grove of academe 
young men came to study just as they traveled to the other 
great centers of learning at bologna in italy and oxford in 
england where great masters opened up worlds of theology 
philosophy logic law medicine and the arts the concerns of the 
quarter were intellectual its life was controversy 
it was a time of momentous events and heroic figures roger 
bacon thomas beckett thomas aquinas the philosopher peter 
abelard and his wife heloise all were teaching or studying on the 
rustic left bank of the seine 
troubadours spread a new idea of romantic love the inquisition 
spread its terror searching and finding heretical ideas anywhere 
new thought flourished 
sorbonne doctors rendered decisions on ecclesiastical and 
theological debate for the pope advised kings and administered 
their own law independent of the throne 
barely a shadow of this greatness remains 
never mind the changes ms gendreaumassaloux said 
people still know the sorbonne by its tradition as a refuge for 
intellectuals a place apart from political currents a defender of 
free expression against state and military power the sorbonne 
still enjoys a great deal of prestige

<TEXT>
many health maintenance organizations attract 
patients with promises of low fees and broad coverage but they 
fail to point out one financial detail their doctors can often 
fatten their pay by skimping on care 
in fact at many hmos a simple rule of economics prevails the 
less their doctors do the more money they make 
many physicians have run across situations where pretty 
horrifying things happened because it looked as though a doctor was 
withholding service because of the hmo financial incentives said 
dr douglas f levinson a psychiatrist at the medical college of 
pennsylvania 
payments vary dramatically among these popular medical plans 
not all offer strong rewards for miserly care for instance some 
of the nations biggest and oldest hire fulltime staffs and pay 
them straight salaries their financial inducements to hold back 
treatment are usually relatively slight 
but many that started during the 1980s have made financial 
incentives their centerpiece these hmos contract with individual 
doctors who see hmo customers along with privatepractice patients 
to keep doctors from spending too lavishly hmos typically pay 
flat monthly fees for each patient no matter how often the doctor 
sees them bonuses and penalties depend on how frugal or free they 
have been with tests referrals to specialists and hospital 
admissions 
hmos supporters say the result is costconscious medicine that 
is better for everyone since it helps avoid unnecessary and 
potentially harmful tests and treatments indeed some believe too 
much medical attention is as dangerous as too little 
however others worry the financial rewards are so strong that 
even ethically minded doctors will be tempted to err in favor of 
doing too little in situations where the correct course of 
treatment is unclear 
no one has studied the medical fate of people who join hmos with 
strong financial rewards and penalties so there is no clear 
evidence this potential conflict of interest is harmful 
nonetheless troubling anecdotes abound 
dr denise hart a kidney specialist in san antonio remembers a 
patient with kidney failure who went to a hospital one sunday night 
in urgent need of dialysis treatment 
the emergency room doctor wanted to call in hart to see the man 
but when he called the patients hmo primarycare doctor the 
gatekeeper in hmo terminology for permission the physician 
refused instead hart said the patient stayed overnight in the 
hospital without dialysis as a result he suffered cardiac arrest 
and spent a week on a respirator 
i think it was greed hart said of the hmo doctor he 
tried to squeak by without getting stuff done that absolutely 
needed to be done the system is set up so there is a strong 
incentive for these things to happen 
the patient recovered and nothing happened to the doctor 
elsewhere however hmos financial incentives to limit care have 
figured in malpractice suits 
according to court papers a saginaw mich hmo patient with 
vaginal bleeding was given antibiotics for five months before her 
doctor sent her to a gynecologist the specialist checked her for 
venereal disease found nothing and told her to return in a month 
however her primarycare doctor refused to approve a second visit 
eight months after her initial visit she went to an emergency room 
where doctors performed a biopsy and discovered she had cervical 
cancer 
the hmo had set up financial pools to cover patients specialist 
appointments tests and hospital care money left over at the end 
of the year was split between the doctor and the hmo 
the result was that the fewer referrals a doctor made and the 
fewer hospitalizations he ordered for his patients the more money 
he made circuit judge robert l kaczmarek wrote in a ruling on 
preliminary pleadings the case is scheduled for trial in january 
when a greenville sc man with a long history of manic 
depression joined an hmo his new physician halted treatment by a 
psychiatrist and took him off medication dr iverson brownell the 
psychiatrist strongly disagreed with the doctors contention that 
a specialist was not needed 
i wrote him that this was completely unsatisfactory said 
brownell adding that financial considerations had to be one 
factor in the doctors decision 
the patient eventually suffered a psychotic episode and could no 
longer work his attorney said a suit against the hmo physician 
was settled out of court 
when a 22yearold woman in wilmington del went to her hmo 
physician complaining of a breast lump she was told not to worry 
about it according to her attorney her gynecologist recommended 
she go to a surgeon for a biopsy but the physician rejected the 
request a year later the woman was found to have spreading cancer 
she sued and reached an outofcourt settlement with her physician 
and the hmo 
her lawyer randall robbins said the plans system of bonuses 
and penalties deterred visits to specialists why else would one 
doctor question anothers request for consultation with a 
specialist unless there was some type of incentive involved 
hmos promotional brochures rarely mention the financial 
incentives that may spur doctors to limit their care instead they 
dwell on the advantages hmo clients pay flat monthly charges that 
are usually lower than traditional health insurance in exchange 
the hmo agrees to give wombtotomb care for every conceivable 
physical ill 
however patients usually cannot see specialists unless their 
primarycare physician the gatekeeper approves the same 
doctor makes most important decisions about tests and hospital care 
nearly half the nations 607 hmos use a method called capitation 
to pay their doctors for a flat monthly fee doctors provide all 
their patients routine office care one industry survey found that 
in 47 percent of capitation arrangements the fee also covers 
tests in 22 percent it covers specialty referrals and in 9 
percent it also pays for hospital care 
such plans along with bonuses and penalties put doctors at 
risk of personal loss of income if they are unfortunate enough to 
have a few very sick and very expensive hmo patients 
depending on the expense of their patients doctors in some hmos 
can raise their pay or lower it by 20 percent 
incentive plans may offer such strong financial incentives to 
physicians to reduce utilization that quality of care could be 
adversely affected through the withholding of needed services 
concluded a report by the us general accounting office

one of the countrys largest hmo organizations to use capitation 
is us healthcare which operates plans with about 1 million 
customers in the northeast their doctors get bonus checks each 
month if they send fewer than the expected number of patients to 
specialists or to hospitals 
dr neil schlackman us healthcares medical director defends 
incentives as long as quality of care is also figured into the 
basic payment formulas 
if you are in first grade a gold star may help said 
schlackman but in a physicians office the only thing that 
really gets the attention of the physician is the incentive of 
increasing payment for better quality costeffective care 
dr lorna stuart of phoenixville pa gets about half of her 
patients from us healthcare while she said she is not tempted by 
the incentives she is not so sure about her colleagues some 
family doctors may be tempted to avoid specialists fees by trying 
their hand at tasks for which they are unqualified such as taking 
on the plastic surgeons job of repairing facial cuts she said 
if a doctors ethics were not golden they might say i can 
sew that up myself and the patient would be left with a 
secondrate repair job she said but the doctor would not have 
that consultants charge taken out of his pool 
many doctors say they give hmo patients just as good care as 
they give those with private insurance however evidence is 
building that the care while perhaps as good is different 
in a recent study doctors at virginia commonwealth university 
compared the way 17 doctors performed checkups forty percent of 
their privately insured patients received four or more tests 
compared with 11 percent of their hmo patients 
in another study dr alan l hillman of the university of 
pennsylvania found hmo doctors who were at financial risk for their 
patients hospital bills also tended to see patients in their 
offices less often he interpreted this as scheduling less visits 
in order to use less services 
we all believe that most doctors will do whats in the 
patients best interest when its obvious what to do said 
hillman 
hillman said crooked doctors may blatantly hold back care just 
to make more money more often however doctors honestly disagree 
about whats needed in those situations some physicians may 
consistently decide against tests and procedures because they are 
subconsciously swayed by financial reasons 
in my opinion he said there are at least a few hmos that 
are at the extreme end of the incentives and we need to find out 
which those are 
however dr donald berwick vice president for quality of care 
measurement at the harvard community health plan in boston said 
traditional medicine gives doctors financial motives to provide too 
much care rather than too little 
i am worried by systems that really place physicians greatly 
at risk for the consequences of their clinical judgments as i am 
worried about systems that place physicians interest greatly in 
accord with doing lots of procedures he said there are 
hazards at both ends

when the forerunners of health maintenance 
organizations opened for business around the turn of the century 
the idea was simple two doctors joined forces to take care of 
customers for 50 cents a month 
the basic notion of allinclusive coverage for a flat fee 
remains but otherwise the financial arrangements between hmos and 
their physicians have grown far more complicated 
here are the basic kinds of hmos 
staff model care is provided by doctors who are fulltime 
employees of the hmo 
group model the hmo contracts with a large independent group 
practice to tend its patients 
network model instead of relying on just one group the hmo 
has ties with several group practices 
individual practice association eighty percent of hmos that 
are less than 3 years old use this arrangement most care is 
provided by individual doctors in private practice they may see 
patients from several hmos as well as those covered by traditional 
insurance 
here are some of major financial arrangments 
salary typically used by staff model hmos doctors also may 
share in a yearend bonus if the hmo makes money 
fee for service doctors are paid a fee by the hmo each time 
they see a patient 
capitation doctors receive a flat monthly fee for each 
patient whether they see them several times or not at all 
depending on the arrangement the fee may cover only office visits 
to the primarycare doctor or it may include tests referrals to 
specialists or hospitalization 
risk pools the hmo withholds a percentage of the physicians 
pay the doctor gets all or part of the money back if some 
financial goal is met some hmos use money in the pools to cover 
the deficit if the doctor overspends the amount allocated for 
specialty and hospital care 
deficits if the physicians spending exceeds the amount set 
aside in the risk pool he may be expected to make up the 
difference by direct repayment to the hmo by reduced capitation 
fees or an increase in the amount withheld from future risk pools 
stoploss the hmo may put a dollar limit on the physicians 
potential losses for expensive patients 
bonuses if the physician spends less than the amount budgeted 
by the hmo for patients major services such as referrals and 
hospital care he may split the leftover money with the hmo

should patients be told their doctor has a 
financial stake in keeping them away from specialists and out of 
hospitals 
many health maintenance organizations pay their doctors more if 
they are frugal with tests and other expensive care even though 
such financial arrangements can influence the kind of treatment 
patients get the incentives are rarely disclosed when people sign 
up with the prepaid plans 
some believe that should change 
when we talked to our patients they didnt have the foggiest 
idea how these things really worked said dr joel rubenstein a 
cardiologist at newtonwellesley hospital in suburban boston 
i thought that was not correct because ultimately patients 
and physicians should have a straightforward relationship he 
said it should be one where the physician is always the 
patients advocate there should be no competing interest to that 
advocacy 
rubenstein is coauthor of a bill now before the massachusetts 
legislature that would require hmos to spell out their physicians 
financial incentives in brochures written in plain english the 
massachusetts medical society supports the proposal 
however dr harris berman president of the boston areas tufts 
associated health plan said people who join hmos already know that 
their doctors are supposed to work in a costeffective fashion 
anyway he added it doesnt matter how much we put in print 
most people dont read it 
disclosure has figured into at least one legal case against an 
hmo in a class action suit filed under the federal racketeering 
law us healthcare has been taken to court in philadelphia for 
not making these incentives clear 
its a classic case of fraud for the patient not to be 
informed said merrill g davidoff one of the lawyers who 
brought the suit 
at us healthcare dr michael a stocker a senior vice 
president said financial incentives are discussed in news articles 
and in state rate filings 
however it is not industry tradition to disclose incentives 
directly to clients stocker said physicians dont disclose how 
much money they make if they provide a procedure to a patient if 
it becomes traditional within the industry we would do it too

advocates for the elderly are dismayed that 
president bush has not called what would be the fourth decennial 
white house conference on aging for 1991 to help guide a graying 
america into the next century 
time is short for planning a productive conference that can 
steer clear of intergenerational conflicts and avoid political 
pitfalls that plagued the last such gathering in 1981 supporters 
say opinion is divided however on whether the inaction is a 
result of normal bureaucratic delay a reluctance to convene a 
populist gathering of the elderly or a desire to limit its scope 
there is a growing sense that the white house really doesnt 
want this conference and therefore would like to delay it as long 
as possible said fernando torrezgil presidentelect of the 
american society on aging 
the white house conferences which bring together thousands of 
delegates from around the nation to focus on the needs and 
contributions of the elderly and their role in society have been a 
decennial tradition since 1961 
the first two helped launch federal programs ranging from 
medicare to mealsonwheels the 1981 gathering though marred by 
politics helped fend off cuts in social security 
congress in 1987 passed legislation authorizing not requiring 
the president to continue the tradition in 1991 but bush has yet 
to announce his intentions he is interested in having one but 
more work needs to be done before a final decision can be made 
said white house spokeswoman alixe glen 
twentyfour major groups the leadership council of aging 
organizations wrote to bush in august urging him to call a 
conference and 90 house members sent a similar request in 
september warning that time is running out the house letter 
was initiated by rep thomas downey dny who said previous 
presidents acted earlier to call each of the preceding conferences 
expectations that a 1991 conference was a certainty now are 
giving way to skepticism about whether there will be one said 
dan quirk executive director of the national association of state 
units on aging 
advocates say the 1991 conference is needed to help the nation 
prepare for its unprecedented aging the population 65 and over is 
expected to rise from 12 percent in 1987 to nearly 23 percent by 
2040 in sheer numbers that means an increase from 298 million in 
1987 to 681 million in 2040 with the biggest increases occuring 
among the oldest of the elderly 
every institution in society is going to have to respond to 
the needs of a much older population quirk said this 
conference could set the stage to prepare for that demographic 
revolution 
torrezgil predicted bush eventually would yield to pressure 
but that the conference date would be pushed back from 1991 
bush could derive real dividends from convening a bipartisan 
conference that is a genuine town meeting on issues in the field 
of aging said arthur flemming a former health education and 
welfare secretary who chaired the 1971 conference and was deputy 
chairman 10 years later 
but daniel schulder of the national council on the aging said 
bush may be dragging his feet to limit a conferences scope and 
reduce grassroots interest generated by the state and local forums 
that typically precede it 
if you delay long enough you only have time for a much 
smaller kind of conference directed toward mavens and experts 
rather than a popular conference he said the signals are 
clearly dilatory 
the death earlier this year of rep claude pepper of florida 
the singular champion of the elderly has limited congress ability 
to exert pressure for a 1991 conference schulder said 
in the absence of a decision from washington some states are 
moving ahead on their own illinois for example is organizing 
local forums and a state conference regardless of what bush does 
the challenge to be part of the solution to the everincreasing 
problems of an aging society is an opportunity we do not want to 
see forsaken said state aging director janet otwell 
while most advocacy groups are pressing for a 1991 conference a 
few voices question its usefulness and warn of a potential backlash 
against the elderly 
dr robert butler a former director of the national institute 
on aging questions whether spending millions on a vapid 
decennial ritual that he said could fuel conflicts between the 
young and old while accomplishing little 
let us not provide another opportunity for writers press and 
the public to image older people as special pleaders or greedy 
geezers butler wrote recently he said an annual report on the 
status of the aged would be better 
one advocacy group avoiding the push for the white house 
conference is the gray panthers which believes many concerns of 
the elderly such as health care and housing are better addressed 
as issues for society overall we feel that we need to take a 
more holistic look at the problems of our society said executive 
director frances humphreys we would love to see an 
intergenerational conference 
supporters of a conference on aging believe it must focus not on 
what government can do for senior citizens but on how the nations 
aging affects all of society and on concerns that cut across 
generations 
joyce berry acting us commissioner on aging this summer told 
a house panel that health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan was interested in focusing the conference on a binding 
of generations and capitalizing upon what generations can do for 
each other 
issues such as access to health care nursing home costs 
employment income security and family caregiving are no longer 
older persons issues they are family issues said illinois 
otwell 
the national council on the aging suggested a concurrent white 
house conference on children so common problems could be evaluated 
in a coordinated way without pitting young and old against one 
another 
dual conferences could help blunt the resentment of people who 
like to think in terms of generational warfare schulder said 
conference supporters say that besides promoting generational 
unity the meeting must avoid the politicization of 1981 when the 
reagan administration was accused of trying to pack the event with 
supporters of proposed budget cuts in social security and other 
programs the legislation that authorizes the 1991 conference says 
delegates shall be selected without regard to political 
affiliation or past partisan activity 
were hoping for a conference in 1991 but only if its 
constructive and only if its properly funded and meaningful 
said john rother legislative director of the american association 
of retired persons i dont think anybody wants a repeat of 
1981

to hear capt jack young tell it just when 
youve reached the peak of your abilities flying a jetliner they 
kick you out of the cockpit 
when a pilot reaches 60 he has gotten there because hes 
healthy and proficient said young 69 who was forced by 
30yearold federal aviation administration rules to quit flying 
airliners after 35 years in the cockpit 
despite mounting pressure and the heroics of veteran pilots the 
faa sees no reason to change its ruling that commercial pilots and 
copilots hand over the controls at 60 or at least get in the back 
seat as flight engineer 
it should be optional to continue or retire at 60 or any other 
age if a man is physically fit and functionally able and motivated 
to continue flying he should be able to do so said young a 
former eastern airlines pilot and the founder of the gray 
eagles formally the pilots rights association 
he hopes to draw on public admiration for veterans like al 
haynes 58 the united airlines captain who landed in iowa in july 
with no hydraulic controls and david cronin 59 the united pilot 
who safely landed in february on his secondtolast commercial 
flight after a section of fuselage blew out 
the faa developed the rule because statistics showed a 
significantly higher incidence of incapacitating events after age 
60 said john leyden a spokesman in washington that has been 
the basis for 30 years 
the agency has never satisfied itself of a way to separate 
healthy 60yearolds from those showing their age leyden said 
making it 60 may not be the best way to go but we dont know of 
any better way 
the rule which took effect march 15 1960 has been challenged 
repeatedly at the faa and in the courts numerous pilots have 
sought exemptions but all have lost most recently in a may 
decision on a request by 24 pilots 
the faa noted that while a number of older pilots oppose the 
rule others and their union the air line pilots association 
support it 
were opposed to changing the rule said dick stone 57 a 
delta captain and alpa executive chairman for aeromedical 
resources health and safety aside he said it ensures promotion 
for younger pilots if we changed the age to an older age it would 
stall the careers of some pilots 
each side can cite studies supporting its point but the faa 
said in may that a performance probably starts diminishing past 50 
and the experience of pilots age 60 and over does not outweigh 
the danger they present from sudden incapacitation or otherwise 
diminished mental or physical performance 
the faa said it is willing to look at any scientific evidence 
that will help find a way to discriminate between those who 
contribute to the adverse trend of increasing accidents involving 
older pilots and those who do not 
age in and of itself should not be the criterion said dr 
herbert karp a professor of medicine and neurology at atlantas 
emory university and medical director at the wesley woods geriatric 
hospital we know that as we get older there are certain 
physiological changes that do occur 
but theres a great variability in the occurrence of these 
changes 
mandatory retirement based on age has very little 
justification and even if there were such a cutoff 60 is 
probably as much as a decade too soon he said we cant say but 
it would be likely to be in the seventh decade 
we really think of problems emerging at 75 and above said 
dr robert n butler brookdale professor of geriatrics at new 
yorks mount sinai medical center there is an increased 
incidence of cardiovascular disease in the late 50s and 60s but 
theres no sort of arbitrary jump at a magical age called 60 
besides butler said in a jetliner theres at least one other 
crew member to fly if the pilot suffers a heart attack but the age 
60 rule applies only to airline pilots nothing says a 100yearold 
cant fly a cessna anywhere 
there are people over 60 flying airplanes all the time he 
said its only passenger carriers that they havent been 
flying 
butler a former director of the national institute on aging 
once proposed letting some pilots fly past 60 under a test program 
the faa declined we do need experienced pilots and its a shame 
they havent gotten to test it 
meanwhile a group of about 30 pilots fighting the rule has 
filed an appeal in the seventh us circuit court of appeals in 
chicago which is expected to hear the case sometime next year 
the gray eagles are waiting anxiously as many as 1000 veteran 
pilots who arent quite ready for a life of fishing and golf 
its one of those things said young unless youre a 
pilot you cant understand the magic of flying and the hold it has 
on you 
these are guys who feel they can continue making a 
contribution and they want to continue doing so

being a grandparent does mean holidays 
birthdays going fishing and baking cookies it also means helping 
grandchildren deal with the pressures of growing up by sharing the 
benefit of a longer lifes experience 
but meaningful communication is more than how did you do at 
school today said robert strom an arizona state university 
psychologist who taught a 12week class becoming a better 
grandparent grandparents used to have a role that was well 
defined they understood what they were supposed to do and most of 
the family counted on the grandparents 
the course offered by strom and his wife shirley an arizona 
state research associate attracted more than 200 grandparents from 
the phoenix area for weekly 90minute discussion sessions 
participants each interviewed one of their grandchildren once a 
week and listened to taperecorded discussions of young people 
talking about issues that were important to them 
almost all of the literature on grandparents is entirely 
patronizing strom said it suggests that grandparernts dont 
need any education because theyre all so old and wise 
but participants found many subjects about which they werent so 
wise topics like drugs aids gender roles and self esteem they 
watched videotapes of children and their parents giving their views 
on the same subjects they found that their views on many subjects 
changed as the classes progressed 
we had a tendency to compare our grandchildren with how we 
raised our children said rodie wright of sun city we found 
out that was all wrong we also found out we had to be more 
openminded 
and they learned its ok to take a more active role 
we must give advice openly and freely knowing the choice is 
theirs whether it is accepted said phyllis wells of casa grande 
the grandparents were provided with questions to ask 
grandchildren to get to know them better strom said the 
affection was there but they were not talking not communicating 
about important issues 
participants came away with a better understanding of their 
grandchildren as well as their own roles as grandparents 
we came away from the class feeling really good about our 
chances of staying close to our granddaughters said barbara 
yarger of phoenix who attended with her husband bill we 
learned how to break the barriers

ann valletta was devastated when her husband 
died 15 years ago but she began a new life as a grandmother to 
handicapped kids i came here and i found myself she said 
during a break at the rehabilitation institute of pittsburgh where 
she works with children five days a week if i hadnt come to 
this place i think i would have been in a sanitarium i find peace 
here 
mrs valletta 77 is one of 20000 foster grandparents across 
the nation and in puerto rico and the virgin islands helping kids 
with special needs in homes schools hospitals daycare and 
detention centers and halfway houses 
the foster grandparents program was established by the 
government in 1965 to help lowincome people over 60 remain active 
in community service by helping youngsters who are disabled 
troubled abused or neglected it is successful because it 
combines two groups of people who need each other and it 
clicks said ray tejada national director 
we tend to forget the contributions that elderly people can 
make said former first lady nancy reagan who has supported 
foster grandparents since the late 1960s there are all kinds of 
things that come with age such as more patience and more 
understanding and this is the one program that helps both ends of

whos doing thanksgiving this year 
is it at your childrens and are they cooking up the big bird 
with all the trimmings celebrating with their favorite foods and 
introducing them to their children or is it just the two of you 
where a capon duck or cornish hen with a tasty stuffing 
vegetables salad and a light dessert fit the bill 
whatever the setting or number of people all the holiday 
favorites bring back memories of this wonderful day from our own 
childhoods 
at our house it was oldfashioned stuffing white bread 
celery onions and a hefty sprinkling from a yellow poultry 
seasoning box with an illustrated turkey on it a lot of stuffing 
went inside me and come dinnertime my appetite was diminished my 
grandmother always made salted cashews for holiday dinners baked 
until a burnished bronze rubbed with brown paper to remove excess 
fat then placed in tiny silver nut dishes that i had polished my 
sister gerry and i would tiptoe around the table taking a nut or 
two from each dish my hunch is the grownups were aware of the 
game but winked it away 
its very likely that well enjoy many of our favorites 
cranberry sauce sweet potato pudding mashed potatoes with gravy 
creamed onions tunips green beans pumpkin or mincemeat pie to 
really enjoy the day we should eat smaller portions but not enjoy 
it less 
if you are having thanksgiving with your family you may want to 
pitch in the next day and do something with the leftovers turkey 
salad with fall fruits would be a delightful entree that puts the 
bird in a different setting 
if its dinner a deux a light refreshing allnatural fruit ice 
cream dessert leaves out the cream and eggs but doesnt change the 
flavor or texture 
and if youre taking a covered dish turnip souffle is a part of 
the traditional vegetable scene that even nonturnip fans will like

some vegetables give us a hard time in 
the garden before if ever we win them over the key may lie in an 
offbeat approach 
directions on seed packets dont help much theyre generalized 
whereas a garden is a highly individual quirky place 
for a long time parsnips stumped me parsnips are a 
longmaturing crop going from spring into fall frosts before you 
harvest the delicious taproots but i couldnt even get the seeds 
to sprout homespun solutions like covering the row with damp 
newspapers or wetting it down and putting a board on top to 
prolong the moisture did nothing for me 
finally i moved the process indoors and started the seeds like 
tomatoes peppers and eggplants with carefully controlled soil 
light temperature and moisture in sixpack cells i planted seeds 
in good potting soil and put them under my fluorescent stand in 
two weeks all six seeds had sprouted 
after the seedlings formed true leaves i moved them out to the 
cold frame for a week of hardening on planting day i punched deep 
holes in the ground with an iron bar filled the holes with compost 
mixed with fertilizer and put in the seedlings in a few weeks i 
had strong healthy plants 
its unorthodox with a root crop but it worked for me carrots 
also poor sprouters responded to the same treatment 
beets germinated in my garden all right but i got dwarfish 
stunted crops until i read in a manual use wood ashes where you 
grow beets with ashes plentiful from fireplace and woodstove 
the situation improved dramatically i moved up to plump tender 
beets in a single season wood ashes rich in potash and the 
alkalinity needed to sweeten the soil also help many other 
vegetables flowers and shrubs spread storebought lime if you 
dont have ashes but dont use either on plants that like acid 
with beets you mix the ashes into the soil before planting and 
then make side dressings as the season moves on 
frustration comes from planting too early or in an unsuitable 
spot 
my garden in hilly wooded country 50 miles north of manhattan 
tends to be cool by trial and error i learned that it was 
unrealistic to plant warmthloving things like beans before the 
middle of may an early day may be balmy but the ground is still 
cold and seeds just rot my best bean harvests come from seeds 
planted in june july and august 
and part of my garden gets some shade fine for greens like 
lettuce but not for sunlovers like beans and tomatoes that need at 
least six hours of direct sunlight 
homesick for the tropics eggplants act moody in northern 
climes they like heat so much that some people put seed flats near 
the furnace or on radiators to get them to germinate in my 
climate we dont set the plants in the ground until well into 
june youve got to watch your harvest closely too picking the 
fruit when its young firm and lustrous when eggplants soften and 
lose their shine the taste goes off 
a retired person with time to experiment can challenge the 
improbable like raising artichokes in the northeast where winter 
likely kills even the bestmulched plants horticulturists with 
professional savvy and equipment have found a way the secret is to 
start the seed early in february in wet sphagnum moss in the 
refrigerator in this cold but not freezing temperature you 
vernalize the emerging radicle the first part of the root for 
at least two weeks before taking it out of the refrigerator and 
planting it in a pot 
come spring you transplant it outdoors the process shortens 
the artichokes normal twoyear life cycle the luscious globes are 
then obtainable in six months a scientist friend gave me such a 
plant and produced a globe in my garden but i havent had any luck 
doing it on my own in the refrigerator 
the seeds of some plants may defy all attempts to get them to 
germinate 
new zealand spinach a popular summer vegetable which flourishes 
when other greens wilt in the sun often maddeningly refuses to 
sprout you may soak the large seed before planting it you may 
baby it indoors nothing helps but a lesson i irony new 
zealand spinach loves to seed itself and youll find plants 
springing up at unexpected places in your garden the offspring of 
summers past 
nature likes to keep you guessing

elmo meiners makes a living off 
something that he really enjoys though he has to get up a little 
early to do it 
my biggest satisfaction is going out every morning at 530 and 
talking to farmers playing a little gin rummy and finding out 
what they think 
for 40 years meiners has been asking farmers what equipment 
would make things easier then manufacturing it and that didnt 
stop even during his 75th birthday party in august as the cake was 
cut he was sketching 
farmers needs inspired meiners and art warsaw to develop a 
transmission to double the speed of the farmall tractor in 1949 
that was the birth of mampw gear co assembled in an old oneroom 
schoolhouse the mampw ninespeed transmission caught on the company 
sold 1400 the first year grossing 160000 
success with the transmission led to development of parts like 
aluminum pistons that raised the farmalls power from 39 to 51 
horsepower watching the farmers haul grain in 100bushel wagons 
with small tires gave him the idea for the little red wagon it 
held 300 bushels and large floater tires enabled it to glide 
over the field with less effort 
we just grew grew grew said meiners whose company is 
expected to sell nearly 30 million in farm implements this year 
warsaw sold his interest in mampw to william and jc ertel of 
indianapolis in 1954 mampws small size about 175 plant workers 
lets it get a product to farmers within a year or two of design 
faster than the major implement makers he said 
mampw builds a few prototypes for local farmers to use and 
evaluate and meiners often tests the equipment on his own 
1500acre family farm in mclean county agriculture is changing 
so rapidly that its not difficult to improve equipment for 
farmers he said 
mampw innovations include the first engine turbochargers for 
tractors and a hay baler that wraps the huge roll in plastic to 
protect it from weather while it is stored in the field said john 
e smith vice president of marketing it now concentrates on 
tillage equipment hay machinery and mowing devices

kitty good doesnt believe in letting her 
paintings speak for themselves 
each of the nearly 100 scenes she has done since she was 62 
comes with a story usually about her childhood on an isolated 
700acre farm outside roanoke rapids nc i hated it when i 
lived there and i was lonely 
mrs good 83 recalls her early life in colorful detailed 
paintings in the primitive style made famous by grandma moses 
in one a black woman stands outside a church holding a white 
baby the story of a childless black couple who raised a 
6weekold boy abandoned by an unmarried white woman the black 
woman prayed all her life that the mother and son would be 
reunited two years before the black woman died they were 
in another mrs goods parents sit on the porch of their 
farmhouse while their six children play croquet on the lawn two 
paintings show here june 1930 wedding one shows glenn and kitty 
good surrounded by wedding guests outside the church and another is 
of the wedding reception at the farmhouse 
that wedding took kitty good from the remote countryside to 
richmond where she raised four children her husband died in 1979 
i never had a brush in my hand until i was 62 years old and 
then i had it in there because of a dare it was such a joke to 
me 
hope davis taught the art class mrs good entered i took one 
look and tried to isolate her from all of the people around her who 
might corrupt her it was just so obvious that she was a natural 
primitive 
primitivists have a talent for color and composition and often 
draw from their memories she said they paint everything 
individually its absolutely amazing people laugh at them a lot 
of times because theyre so childlike 
mrs good heard plenty of ridicule family and friends asked why 
her fences and some of her figures looked like they were lying down 
she would be on the verge of tears ms davis said she 
would call me and say my family is laughing at me i said 
before youre through theyre going to be laughing on the other 
side of their face 
mrs goods paintings are in the asheville museum of art the 
virginia beach center for the arts and the collections of csx

an exercise program designed to help older 
americans become better drivers by improving their flexibility is 
described in a pamphlet available from the american automobile 
association 
the program which includes exercises like chin tucks neck 
rotations and side bends is meant to help avoid fatigue and 
improve neck waist and shoulder flexibility in such situations as 
braking backing and adjusting mirrors 
it was developed by west virginia university where researchers 
financed by the aaa foundation for traffic safety found that 
exercise can improve older drivers range of motion 
there is mounting evidence that much of the decline in 
physical fitness that people experience as they grow older stems 
from rusting out rather than wearing out because living in a 
technologically advanced society has led people to pursue more 
sedentary lifestyles the pamphlet says 
copies of a flexibility fitness training package for improving 
older driver performance are available for 15 cents each from 
local aaa clubs or the aaa foundation for traffic safety 1730 m

new york money manager mario j gabelli 
who has acquired a 51 percent stake in quaker state corp 
believes the companys stock is undervalued and says hes 
optimistic the motor oil refiner will return to solid profitability 
gabelli said friday he acquired the quaker state shares as an 
investment for his stable of mutual funds 
gabelli said his analysis of quaker states operations runs 
counter to that of other wall street analysts who have issued 
negative reports both on quaker state because of disappointing 
profits and on the entire motor oil market 
gabelli whose stake makes his company quaker states largest 
shareholder expressed confidence in jack w corn the companys 
president and chief executive officer 
we think corn has positioned the company in a more sensible 
way gabelli said previous management took some wrong turns 
corn succeeded chairman quentin e wood as chief executive in 
july 1988 
gabelli and other analysts credit corn with shifting quaker 
states marketing strategy away from heavy discounting which was 
aimed at retaining market share 
other analysts have said that by adopting higher prices quaker 
state is losing market share and not gaining profits 
during the first nine months of 1989 quaker state reported a 
profit of 945 million or 35 cents a share on sales of 61398 
million that compares with a profit of 959 million or 35 cents 
a share on sales of 6734 million during the 1988 period 
but gabelli said corn is building a solid foundation for future 
profits and in time quaker states performance will rebound 
he has repositioned the product telling retailers that 
quaker state will not be a loss leader he said 
gabelli praised quaker states chain of 444 quick lube shops as 
extremely well run and said the company benefits from the high 
recognition of the quaker state brand name 
he said quaker states stock is undervalued at 14 or 15 a 
share 
the companys stock closed friday at 1487 in consolidated new 
york stock exchange trading down 12 cents on thursday it jumped 
112 after gabelli group inc disclosed in a securities and 
exchange commission filing that it acquired the quaker state stake

he was endorsed sunday by the teamsters for a democratic union 
a dissident group within the 16 millionmember international 
brotherhood of teamsters the nations largest trade union 
we have an opportunity to move this union in new directions 
and we cant miss our chance to regain control of the leadership 
that has ignored the needs of members for too long carey told 
the teamsters for a democratic union on saturday 
our unions negative image has been formed because of 5 
percent of union officials who are corrupt he said 
about 500 members from across the united states and canada 
gathered over the weekend at a pittsburgh hotel for the 14th annual 
convention of teamsters for a democratic union 
in addition to endorsing careys nomination delegates passed a 
resolution prohibiting negotiation of twotier contracts which 
provide lower wage scales for some workers doing the same job 
the tdu was formed in 1976 in detroit to oppose union election 
policies now claiming 10000 members the group has been 
instrumental in winning sweeping reforms in the union notably the 
right to majority rule in elections and contract votes 
also invited to address the convention were teamsters president 
william j mccarthy and secretarytreasurer weldon mathis who were 
expected to run for the unions top office neither accepted the 
invitation or was available to comment on careys remarks 
carey 53 has been a teamsters member for 34 years as a united 
parcel service delivery driver he doesnt belong to the tdu but 
said he supports its goal of giving members more of a voice 
i would hope that with what we could achieve in 1991 that tdu 
wont have to be tdu he told the crowd which interrupted his 
speech several times with standing applause ive been tdu all 
along in terms of my beliefs 
last year under pressure from the justice department which is 
fighting alleged corruption in the teamsters the union agreed to 
allow all union contracts to be decided by majority vote 
previously union policy required a twothirds vote to reject 
pacts approved by teamsters leaders the tdu and other asserted 
that such elections led to sweetheart deals between union 
leadership and employers at the expense of the members 
in march union leaders agreed to allow the rankandfile to 
vote directly for the unions president secretarytreasurer and 
the 16 vice presidents who make up the teamsters general executive 
board 
until now teamsters leaders were appointed by the board which 
in turn was selected by the general president and confirmed by 
fellow board members 
in a sixmonth selection process that will begin in october 
members will vote for delegates to a june 1991 convention where 
candidates who receive 5 percent of the delegates vote will be up 
for a ballot in an election in the fall of 1991 all union members 
will be eligible to vote in that election 
carey hopes to appear on the ballot and says he is trying to 
assemble a coalition of reformminded candidates

the annual showcase for the computer industry 
comdex fall kicks off its second decade today with stronger 
foreign participation than ever 
organizers say interest from abroad is a major factor in the 
expansion of the show which this year will attract a record 1740 
companies showcasing their wares to an expected audience of 120000 
the latest in computer technology will be spread over exhibit 
space covering an area the size of 21 football fields 
if attendance is as expected it will set a record for any trade 
show in the united states said sheldon adelson the shows 
originator 
id never have dreamed it would grow to something like this 
he said last week in a telephone interview while wrapping up final 
details for the annual computer extravaganza but then no one 
expected to see the computer market grow the way its growing 
a total of 365 foreign companies will be exhibiting this year 
up from 301 a year ago they will represent 22 foreign countries 
about 15 percent of the attendees will come from abroad 
foreign participation is so strong that the organizers have 
staff interpreters standing by 
when an exhibitor comes to the show he can put his product 
into the worldwide distribution mainstream adelson said 
comdex officials say the relaxation of trade barriers around the 
world is making a significant impact on the computer industry 
americans are finding they must compete with a rising number 
of hardware and software suppliers from europe canada the pacific 
rim and latin america not only in these foreign markets but 
right here in the us says ellen glew she is president and 
founder of egi an international marketing consulting firm 
specializing in the computer and communications industries 
laptop computers are expected to be a hot item again at the 1989 
show and some exhibitors are even moving down a notch showcasing 
computers small enough to fit in the breast pocket of a sports 
jacket 
james fisher vice president of marketing for atari inc says 
business people are constantly faced with the decision of whether 
to carry a laptop on trips 
they dont want to lug it around for a twohour flight he 
said 
ataris portfolio is a onepound computer that operates on two 
aa batteries for 48 hours fits in a jacket pocket and sells for 
400 
fisher says ataris goal at comdex will be to literally have a 
computer for everyone 
poqet computer corp will be showcasing a similar product an 
ibmcompatible pocketsized computer 
coatpocket computers will be the dick tracy watch of the 
1990s the ultimate office extension predicts mark eppley 
chairman of traveling software 
george h conrades a senior vice president at international 
business machines corp will give the keynote address at the 
opening session monday morning the show runs through friday 
conrades address a vision of the 90s creating value in a 
global marketplace will discuss the challenges of competing on a 
global scale 
adelson chairman of interface group of needham mass the 
conventions producer hit upon the idea of comdex while returning 
from another trade show a decade ago 
the first show in 1979 drew fewer than 4000 people today it is 
spread over 10 locations including the sprawling las vegas

chicagos secondlargest bank has come a long way 
since its near collapse in 1984 but the highlight will be when it 
is entirely back in public hands the chairman of continental bank 
said 
the federal deposit insurance corp which holds 26 percent of 
continental stock as a result of bailing out the bank in 1984 is 
preparing to sell the final chunk to the public the chicago 
suntimes reported in sundays editions 
the sale could be conducted as early as this month the 
suntimes said citing unidentified sources 
thomas theobald continental bank chairman has been saying 
since early this year that he wanted a return to full public 
ownership by the end of 1989 he said he is confident the bank will 
reach that watershed in its evolution 
i expect completion of the sale absent extreme volatility in 
the stock market by the end of the year theobald said its 
been pretty wild with 100point swings every day to know how to 
price an offering but if it isnt done by dec 31 then it will be 
jan 5 
the executive said the public offering should not affect the 
bank to a significant degree 
theobald now is turning his attention to the 1990s when 
national interstate banking promises to shift restrictions and 
gobble up smaller banks 
all we can do is try to be better focused and more 
efficient theobald said that makes it more difficult for some 
other ownership group to claim they can do the job better and get 
financing to do the takeover 
regulators and bank analysts said that theobald who came to 
continental in 1987 is the banks best defense against unwanted 
suitors 
continental is a tom theobald story right now said 
prudential bache bank analyst lloyd widom and he is not going to 
manage the bank for someone else 
fdic chairman william seidman said continentals fate is as hard 
to predict as anyones but much depends on whether management 
wants it to be acquired 
much has changed since 1984 when federal regulators 
restructured the bank and owned almost 100 percent of its stock 
after the bank nearly collapsed because of 1 billion in bad energy 
loans 
today continental is a sharply focused business bank 
specializing in controlling interest rate risk for its fortune 1000 
and middlemarket customers 
under theobald the bank left retail banking sold its suburban 
banks and reduced its international operations the bank with the 
exception of an 11 percent drop last quarter has shown 
quarterbyquarter improvement 
the bailout originally predicted to cost 45 billion is 
expected to be as much as 3 billion less thanks to good 
collection efforts on the bad loans by bank employees said fdic 
spokesman alan whitney 
still not everyone thinks highly of theobald 
according to a recent ranking by us banker magazine theobald 
ranked 38th out of 40 bank chief executive officers in terms of 
total return to shareholders in capital appreciation and dividends 
theobald has returned 67 percent to shareholders annually the 
magazine reported

a strike by boeing co production workers enters 
a critical phase this week appearing likely to become the longest 
work stoppage at the aerospace giant in more than 40 years 
with no negotiations scheduled since the nov 4 collapse of a 
sixday effort saturday will be the 45th day of the walkout by the 
international association of machinists and aerospace workers 
the last boeing strike in 1977 lasted 45 days and was the 
longest since a 4month donnybrook in 1948 
the only other postworld war ii boeing strike was a 19day 
walkout in 1965 
tom baker president of machinists district lodge 751 said 
sunday night that talks could happen this week but he said he 
has not heard from federal mediator doug hammond who would 
schedule any talks 
there have been no indications that boeing might want to resume 
talks 
boeing spokesmen were unavailable for comment sunday night 
if the strike lasts much longer boeing could lose the faith of 
its workers baker said 
if they dont get this thing settled before too long theyre 
going to have a very angry work force the workers will feel 
theyre being cheated he said adding his words were not meant 
as a threat 
its a concern really over the years ive been with boeing 
its been a company that has enjoyed having a loyal work force 
its just a concern that that might not be that way after this if 
theyre not careful its not a threat at all 
baker said the union was willing to return immediately to the 
bargaining table as long as its not another charade referring

cutting prices to improve market share 
contributed to a 175 percent drop in k mart corps thirdquarter 
profits while sales rose 55 percent the company said today

share for its third quarter ended oct 25 down from 1261 
million or 63 cents a share for the same period last year

1978 billion up 48 percent from 1888 billion a year ago 
selling general and administrative expenses remained stable

in 1989 
k mart chairman and chief executive officer joseph e antonini 
had told an oct 10 news conference that pricecutting would hurt 
thirdquarter earnings 
while gross margins have been affected by this pricing 
strategy and this has had a negative shortterm impact on earnings 
we are fully committed to maintaining our price leadership in the 
industry antonini said today the lowering of prices is an 
essential part of a longterm strategy to improve our market share 
and we are confident that this will benefit future results

great northern nekoosa corp today 
rejected georgiapacific corps 313 billion takeover offer 
saying the 58ashare bid was too low would violate antitrust 
laws and would damage both companies financially 
great northern chairman william r laidig said the 45 billion 
in debt the companies would incur would turn both firms into one 
highly leveraged junk company 
georgiapacifics tender offer represents no more than an 
attempt to take advantage of the industrys current shortterm down 
cycle and to seize for its own benefit the longterm values that 
should belong to all shareholders laidig said in a letter to 
stockholders 
in a second letter to georgiapacific chairman t marshall hahn 
jr who two weeks ago bid for the paper products company he 
called the unsolicited proposal surprising and disturbing 
had you discussed your illconceived proposal with us we 
would have done our best to dissuade you from taking this 
unilateral action laidig said 
a response from georgiapacific was not immediately available 
great northern stock fell 150 to 6062 a share in midday new 
york stock exchange trading 
great northern based in norwalk conn had sales of 36 
billion in 1988 from its paper pulp box lumber and plywood 
operations the company owns 35 million acres of timberland and 
has 20000 employees at its mills and factories in arkansas 
colorado georgia maine mississippi and wisconsin 
the atlantabased georgiapacific had 95 billion in sales 
making paper other forest products and building materials it owns 
65 million acres of timberland and 380 plants and mills employing 
44000 workers 
georgiapacific proposed to buy approximately 54 million 
outstanding shares of great northerns common stock for 58 a 
share a 50 percent premium over the market price before the 
takeover rumors drove up the price the company said acquisition 
would cost a total of 45 billion including refinancing fees and 
expenses 
the offer was the first unsolicited takeover bid in the us 
paper industry it ended a week of takeover speculation that raised 
great northerns stock price 50 percent and prompted analysts to 
predict that other paper and forest products companies may bid for 
great northern 
hahn said at the time of the offer that the bid was friendly and 
open to negotiation 
he said the merged company would be more competitive globally 
and would offer more job stability to georgiapacific and great 
northern employees 
laidig however called the offer distinctly unfriendly he 
said an unstable company would emerge from such a merger that 
would be forced to eliminate important and highly promising 
programs now under way or planned by great northern nekoosa

there is a tax in america that it is argued 
takes money from almost everyone hinders economic progress 
penalizes the innovator and risktaker and rewards speculators 
oddly the administering of this tax is adhered to by almost all 
cities in america even as some of their own leaders rail against 
it along with other advocates of repeal ranging from the 
ultraliberal to ultraconservative 
it is the real estate tax generally assessed more heavily on 
buildings and other improvements than on land even in cities that 
desperately need to rid themselves of empty lots and abandoned 
structures 
steven b cord a retired professor has devoted years to 
correcting this situation studies all over the world he says 
demonstrate that cities improve once the burden of taxes is shifted 
to land rather than structures 
why then has it not been accepted more widely could it be 
that a stigma attaches to the notion which is generally credited 
to henry george the 19th century american economist who believed 
a tax on land was the only tax needed 
george antagonized academic scholars indicating they were 
monkeys with microscopes modernized that might suggest 
computertrained simians a notion sufficient still to exclude a 
wise man and his ideas from broad acceptance 
moreover says cord to even allow cities to consider raising 
taxes on land values and lowering them on improvements might 
involve amendments to state constitutions an impediment that can 
discourage even zealots 
george nevertheless has advocates including academics his 
philosophy is expounded by the henry george school in new york and 
by the nonprofit center for the study of economics based in 
columbia md and run by cord 
and by people in power everywhere more than 20 years ago the 
conclusion of a conference on the crisis of cities attended by 
elected officials tax authorities business people and academics 
among others concluded that real estate taxes were being applied 
to produce the opposite of what was intended 
in spite of this very few cities tax land at higher rates than 
structures many of them prevented from doing so by state law 
pennsylvania with pittsburgh the shining light is an exception 
in town after town in that commonwealth says cord who for 
years taught economics and history there at indiana university 
indiana penn his studies show that reversing the usual formula 
has led to strong development 
it is only logical he says he and others who share his view 
contend that the value of land rises because of the investments of 
others in schools buildings bridges sewers power lines and 
other improvements 
in most if not all cities these improvements are the basis of 
jobs and other economic advances that benefit everyone but perhaps 
most especially the landowner who might have done nothing to 
improve his property 
in fact unimproved property deprives the city of jobs and 
revenues and in some instances hinders other economic activity 
the owner takes little or no risk and pays low taxes but is 
rewarded by the risks and taxes of others 
in some instances it can create a bizarre situation in which 
urban slum land slated for governmentassisted development can rise 
to higher values than in better neighborhoods perhaps helping 
landowners more than slum tenants 
with corecity decay a problem almost everywhere the issue has 
become more relevant than ever advocates of landvalue taxation 
contend that the way taxes are applied now it is cheaper to move 
out of downtown than to build there 
they contend that urban sprawl which relentlessly devours the 
countryside attended by pollution and soaring land values and 
taxes that deny young people the chance to buy a home is a 
consequence of misapplication of urban taxes 
cord relentlessly pursues his goal undismayed at the slow 
progress he believes that some advocates of henry georges ideas 
havent acted practically insisting an allornothing approach 
instead of advocating gradual change

the supreme court today permitted random drug 
testing of boston police officers providing new evidence that the 
justices are willing to allow widespread testing of government 
employees in jobs affecting public safety 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that forcing 
police officers to undergo the tests even when there is no reason 
to suspect drug abuse does not violate their privacy rights 
in its first drugtesting rulings last march the court upheld 
drug and alcohol tests for railway workers involved in accidents 
and us customs service employees applying for drugenforcement 
jobs or those positions that require carrying a firearm 
neither of those rulings directly addressed the question of 
random tests however 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals nevertheless relied on 
those decisions in upholding the constitutionality of random 
urinalysis tests for boston police officers who carry firearms or 
enforce drug laws 
the appeals court last may overturned a federal judges decision 
that the tests violate the officers rights 
since we can find no relevant distinction between a customs 
officer and a police officer we hold the police departments 
drugtesting rule to be constitutional the appeals court said 
the boston police patrolmens association in seeking to ban the 
tests said the boston policy is more farreaching than that 
governing the customs officers 
the customs workers have to undergo tests only if they seek 
promotion or transfer to safetysensitive positions and not if 
they remain in their current jobs the police union argued 
the union said privacy rights of its members were being 
sacrificed to exaggerated fears of drug use 
american society has always been willing to accept certain 
risks in exchange for the freedom it so cherishes but which 
appears to be so rapidly dwindling the unions lawyers said 
us district judge robert e keeton who was overruled by the 
1st circuit court said the boston tests were unjustified because 
the same purpose could be accomplished by testing individual 
officers when there was reason to believe they are using drugs 
despite the intensive media attention devoted to drug abuse 
the department has proffered no evidence that any police 
department in the nation suffers from a drug abuse problem 
keeton said 
department officials said the tests are needed to assure public 
confidence and to prevent officers from becoming susceptible to 
bribery because of a drug habit 
the case is guiney vs roache 89205

here at a glance are highlights of actions 
taken monday by the supreme court

approved a joint operating agreement for the two papers the 
detroit free press and the detroit news 
the federal newspaper preservation act of 1970 authorizes the 
attorney general to give financially failing newspapers an 
exemption from federal antitrust laws todays ruling was the 
courts first on a joint operating agreement between newspapers

advertisers and readers 
todays 44 split which under the high courts rules 
automatically upheld a federal appeals courts decision was set up 
when justice byron r white disqualified himself from the case for 
unexplained personal reasons 
a 44 vote by the justices sets no binding precedent for similar 
controversies in the future mainly because there is no clue as to 
the reasoning of any justice 
the case is michigan citizens for an independent press vs 
thornburgh 881640 
 
drug testing

officers providing new evidence the justices are willing to allow

harcourt brace jovanovich inc said monday 
it lost more than 100 million in the third quarter because of 
cutbacks in public funding for educational materials and nearly 
176 million in writeoffs 
but the orlandobased publisher and insurance carrier predicted 
a large fourthquarter gain after closing a 11 billion deal with 
an anheuserbusch co subsidiary to acquire six hbj theme parks 
the sale expected to be completed later this month should help 
hbj reduce an estimated 29 billion in debt accumulated to fend 
off a hostile takeover by british communications mogul robert 
maxwell in 1987 
for the threemonth period ending sept 30 hbj reported a net 
loss of 1027 million or 141 a share on revenue of 4701 
million that compared with net income of 602 million or 99 
cents a share on revenue of 4632 million for the same 1988 
period 
the losses are calculated after issuing dividends on preferred 
stock 
the company blamed some of its losses on a sharp decline in 
expenditures for public school textbooks and related materials 
hbj said more than half of its 176 million thirdquarter 
writeoffs were linked to the development of the new school texts 
and materials prior to the latesummer downturn 
efforts to streamline operations have included consolidating 
textbook sales for hbj and holt rineheart and winston an austin 
texasbased subsidiary 
on july 1 hbj took over textbooks sales for kindergarten to 
grade eight and holt rinehart was made responsible for grades 
seven through 12 
both companies also have reduced the number of auxiliary 
education materials offered to schools 
hbjs insurance division which accounted for 1207 million of 
thirdquarter revenue recently signed a letter of intent for the 
27 million acquisition of american pioneer life insurance co 
which would be its third acquisition this year 
for the first nine months of the year the company reported a 
net loss 2952 million or 405 a share on revenue of 104 
billion compared with a net loss of 548 million or 91 cents a 
share on revenue of 9669 million last year

the boeing co pleaded guilty today to 
two felony charges of unauthorized conveyance of secret 
pentagon budget documents and agreed to pay more than 52 million 
in fines and restitution 
us district judge ts ellis iii accepted the plea entered by 
attorney robert s bennett after questioning company and 
government lawyers for nearly an hour he said he was concerned 
that the plea and penalties agreed to might not sufficiently cover 
what he called a very serious breach of security 
ellis said he wanted a clear indication that the disposition 
bears a rational relationship to the injury to the united states 
and reflects an awareness on the part of the being co of the 
gravity of it 
i want to be sure that the penalty is appropriate to what i 
consider to be a serious violation of the law ellis said 
the judge criticized boeing for not sending a corporate officer 
from the seattlebased aerospace firm to be present for the guilty 
plea and sentence i think you would have done well to have 
someone here to accept responsibility as officer of the company 
ellis told bennett 
the judge said he would require the corporations board chairman 
to write a letter to him expressing the typical contrition that 
any defendant would express 
in seattle boeing spokesman paul binder said the company did 
consider sending a corporate officer to the hearing but we 
relied on advice from counsel and followed court rules on how a 
company enters a plea in deciding not to send an executive 
representative we did have representation from seattlebased 
company senior counsel who has dealt closely with the 
investigation 
obviously we take this very seriously binder said i 
think to put it in context these are events that occurred from 
1978 until 1985 and i think from the time that it was discovered 
we strengthened our procedures and internal controls and enhanced 
training to assure that similar incidents do not occur 
binder said there are no longer any employees with the company 
who have been implicated in the case 
we have taken every step possible to assure that similar 
incidents do not occur he said the government said in the 
plea agreement that boeing cooperated fully with the investigation 
and that the government has no evidence of any unlawful conveyance 
of classified documents by boeing after 1985 
binder said boeing would send the letter ordered by ellis the 
companys chairman and chief executive officer is frank shrontz 
boeing had government contract sales in 1988 totaling 4792 
billion and 42 billion in the first nine months of this year 
binder said 
ellis fined boeing 20000 and ordered it to pay 52 million in 
restitution which covers the cost of the government investigation 
and the value of the two documents that had been illegally 
obtained the figure also includes 200000 worth of expenses 
boeing incurred to keep former marketing analysis richard fowler on 
its payroll 
fowler is awaiting trial on 39 counts of conspiracy and unlawful 
conveyance of 107 classified documents to boeing between 1979 and 
1985 including studies of president reagans strategic defense 
initiative 
boeing admitted that it accepted two 1984 planning and budget 
documents classified secret from fuller who is scheduled to go on 
trial next month 
assistant us attorney randy bellows said the justice 
department is continuing its investigation to determine who in the 
pentagon gave the documents to fowler who had worked as a civilian 
air force employee before joining boeing 
ellis repeatedly pressed the prosecutor about whether 
investigators were satisfied that no other boeing officials could 
be prosecuted 
for a group of people in a company to know they have these 
documents and take no action is fairly arresting ellis said 
bellows said investigators were unable to prove that other 
boeing officials including fowlers immediate superior knowingly 
accepted the classified documents in violation of the law 
the prosecutor said boeing did not use the documents to obtain a 
contract such as in the ill wind pentagon procurement scandal 
instead the company used the information for general budget and 
planning purposes 
nevertheless bennett conceded there is no question boeing 
should not have had these documents 
today as far as the company is concerned is a very sad day 
in its history bennett said 
bellows said a halfdozen current and former boeing employees 
had been given immunity from prosecution in return for their 
cooperation in the case against fowler the prosecutor said the 
government would seek a court order to revoke the security 
clearances of those witnesses still working for boeing 
bellows noted that boeing or some of its subsidiaries could be 
suspended or barred from receiving pengaton contracts as a result 
of the guilty plea air force officials are reviewing the case he 
said 
in addition bellows said prosecutors are investigating other 
companies whose employees also received pentagon documents from 
fowler but is likely that the government will not be able to 
prosecute several of these companies because the statute of 
limitations on the alleged offenses is about to expire he said

moderate trading monday on the chicago board of trade 
wheat futures opened strong but came under pressure because of 
an absence of export business said analyst dale gustafson of 
drexel burnham lambert inc in chicago

areas helped prices

ongoing speculation about more export business to the soviet union

up 48 percent from 1888 billion 
the gross margin for the quarter shrank to 265 percent of sales 
from 269 percent and k mart attributed the narrowing to lower 
everyday shelf prices 
most costs were stable except for interest expense on debt

borrowings in 1989 
the deterioration in k marts profitability didnt come as a

operating profit of dayton hudsons three major divisions 
increased 31 percent in the first nine months of the year with the 
performance of the mervyns chain leading the way the company said

margins and continued expense control

co continued to show solid profit growth

the aflcio opened its 18th biennial 
convention monday basking in its contribution to the success of 
polands solidarity union and determined to adopt a more militant 
stance at home as a difficult decade draws to a close 
opening the gathering on an upbeat note federation president 
lane kirkland said for all our failings and flaws and unmet 
goals the plain fact is that the american federation of labor and 
congress of industrial organizations is and will remain the largest 
and most active body of free and democratic trade unionists in the 
world 
kirkland delivered a partisan speech to nearly 800 delegates 
denouncing policies of both the reagan and bush administrations and 
predicting attitudes toward unions will improve as the legacy of 
the 1980s becomes clearer 
the bills are coming due and the ticking time bombs are going 
off kirkland said it is morning after in america he said 
putting a negative twist on ronald reagans morninginamerica 
campaign theme of 1984 
kirkland attacked government corruption federal deregulation 
debtridden leveraged buyouts in private business and what he said 
was the exportation of american jobs to cheap labor markets abroad 
the schedule for the weeklong convention of the 141 
millionmember federation includes a mix of celebration and 
solemnity with the tuesday appearance by solidarity leader lech 
walesa the highlight of a gathering that will also include 
addresses by president bush and democratic congressional leaders 
also on tap are the elections of new officers with kirkland 
assured of a sixth twoyear term the welcoming back into the 
federation of the united mine workers 40 years after that union 
pulled out of the umbrella organization and renewed efforts to 
assist workers involved in a number of major strikes including 
those against eastern airlines nynex corp pittston coal group 
and boeing 
in a noisy demonstration of solidarity hundreds of strikers 
from those companies as well as striking las vegas musicians staged 
a late afternoon march through the convention hall 
with solidarity as the convention theme kirkland urged the 
delegates to offer a warm welcome to walesa and wished aloud that 
the us labor movements part in the success of solidarity and 
trade unions in other eastern european nations will provide a new 
lesson for americans regarding the role of trade unions in 
promoting and preserving freedom in our own country 
in every quarter of the globe events are in the saddle and 
are driving the reluctant leaders they have overtaken he said 
the aflcio has been a staunch ally and resource upon which these 
movements have drawn and the demands upon us will multiply as more 
and more of the worlds workers rise to their feet and assert their 
rights 
to that end kirkland and other federation leaders planned 
private meetings with walesa to determine how us unions can best 
help solidarity now that it controls polands government and to 
seek guidance on how to emulate in other nations the federations 
5 million effort to help solidarity during the past eight years 
on the domestic front kirkland left little doubt that organized 
labor planned to take a more aggressive stance both in organizing 
in fastgrowing parts of the economy and in trying to protect its 
traditional base in industry 
solidarity has helped us weather the harsh climate of the 
1980s unimpaired in vigor and tougher in spirit and resolve for 
the experience kirkland said 
bush is to address the convention wednesday with the recent 
compromise with labor over raising the minimum wage providing a 
positive note for his appearance the first before an aflcio 
convention by a us president since jimmy carter in 1979 
but kirkland while avoiding mentioning bush by name left 
little doubt that labor remained dissatisfied with him he took 
particular aim at the strenuous though unsuccessful efforts by 
bush and republicans in congress to pass a constitutional amendment 
banning flag burning 
is it not time our elected representatives turn their 
attention to the real flag burners in our country he said 
what about those employers who practice transitory allegiance to 
the flag of any nation that will provide them with the cheapest and 
most repressed labor in the world 
kirkland said we sound the call for attention to real 
problems and away from the false alarms of diversionists who blow 
the smoke of phony patriotism in the eyes of the public 
the delegates heard monday afternoon from labor secretary 
elizabeth dole and house speaker thomas foley both of whom hailed 
the federation for its international activities 
when the story of ourtime is written it will reflect the fact 
that fredom has to do with labor and that one of the motivating 
forces influencing this tide of democracy was the aflcio mrs 
dole said 
foley thanked the federation for its support of democratic party 
candidates and promised to push for passage of a labor legislative 
agenda specifically promising swift action on measures dealing 
with child care parental leave

precious metal futures prices surged monday on new yorks 
commodity exchange as investors reacted to recent economic 
developments and indications that interest rates might decline 
on other markets grain and soybean futures were mixed energy 
futures fell sharply sugar prices declined and livestock and pork 
futures mostly were higher 
gold settled 410 to 510 higher with the contract for 
delivery in december at 39270 a troy ounce silver was 58 cents 
to 65 cents higher with december at 5318 a troy ounce 
the buying trend for gold and silver started in japan continued 
later in london when trading there began monday morning and 
followed through in new york said analyst stephen w platt of dean 
witter reynolds inc in chicago 
platt said the rally in gold stemmed partly from the metals 
success in surpassing and remaining above technically significant 
price levels 
buying also was linked to the impression that interest rates 
are going down and uncertainty on the east european situation and 
its impact on the european economy platt said 
platt said silver prices rose on spillover buying from gold and 
on bargain hunting by investors 
energy futures were down on the new york mercantile exchange as 
investors reacted to reports that the 13member organization of 
petroleum exporting countries exceeded its 205 million barrels per 
day production ceiling by 3 million barrels last month 
michael rothman of merrill lynch capital markets in new york 
said technical factors also came into play monday but the fall in 
prices stemmed primarily from the production figures 
the slowing in the growth in demand for opec oil could cause 
crude prices to fall further if production remains at current 
levels 
west texas intermediate crude oil was 17 cents to 25 cents lower 
with december at 1959 a barrel heating oil was 76 cent to 90 
cent lower with december at 5768 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline 
was 76 cent to 97 cent lower with december at 5106 cents a 
gallon 
grain and soybean futures closed mixed in moderate trading on 
the chicago board of trade 
wheat futures came under pressure because of an absence of 
export business said analyst dale gustafson of drexel burnham 
lambert inc in chicago commercial selling sent new crop futures 
lower although gustafson said reports of dry conditions in red 
winter wheat areas helped prices 
corn rose fractionally on commercial buying and ongoing 
speculation about increased export business to the soviet union 
gustafson said soybeans were strong extending fridays rally 
soybean prices also were boosted by a strong cash market and 
reports that brazils soybean planting was lagging well behind 
normal 
wheat settled 2 cents to 6 cents lower with december at 402 
a bushel corn was a cent lower to cent higher with december at 
238 a bushel oats were 1 cent to 1 cents higher with december 
at 144 a bushel soybeans were 2 cents to 3 cents higher with 
november at 578 a bushel 
sugar futures declined sharply on new yorks coffee sugar and 
cocoa exchange as profittaking set in following several days of 
price increases 
the decline may have been helped by reports that brazil sold 
sugar over the weekend prices rose last week partially on fears 
brazil would not be able to meet its export commitments 
sugar was 13 cent to 32 cent lower with march at 1487 cents a 
pound 
livestock and pork futures were higher in sluggish trading on 
the chicago mercantile exchange 
the pork price rise was paced by frozen pork bellies which 
soared on commission house buying hog futures were supported by 
expectation of steady pork product prices 
cattle futures were steady supported by spillover strength from 
pork and firm fed cattle prices 
live cattle were 10 cent lower to 12 cent higher with december 
at 7492 cents a pound feeder cattle were 12 cent to 30 cent 
higher with november at 8330 cents a pound hogs were 42 cent to 
93 cent higher with december at 4862 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 185 cents to 195 cents higher with february at 6515

cosmetics company avon products inc on monday 
sought to repel unwanted takeover advances from an alliance of 
powerful investors including oil heir gordon p getty a senior 
mary kay corp executive and the fisher real estate family of new 
york 
a limited partnership called chartwell associates revealing its 
intentions after it became known friday that the group had bought a 
stake in avon said it may propose a merger between avon and itself 
or one of its affiliates 
in a summary of a document filed with the securities and 
exchange commission chartwell associates lp disclosed that it owns 
69 percent of avons common stock and intends to purchase 
additional shares 
an avon spokesman said the company continues to believe that 
avon is better off on its own a position the board of directors 
steadfastly maintained when rejecting previous takeover proposals 
this year 
the board of directors position is that the company is not 
for sale avon spokesman john cox said the best interests of 
the shareholders would be served by avon remaining an independent 
company 
cox declined to comment on whether avons board had scheduled a 
special meeting to consider chartwells interest he said board 
members had been advised about the situation over the weekend by 
management 
wall street reacted coolly to the latest developments in 
contrast to the enthusiastic buying friday after avon announced it 
had been notified that chartwell held more than 5 percent of its 
stock 
avons stock dropped 150 to close at 35 a share in 
consolidated new york stock exchange trading erasing a portion of 
fridays 550 gain 
investors apparently were skeptical about the chances for a 
significant increase in the stock value given that avon seems 
unwilling to enter any merger discussions 
earlier this year avon spurned several suitors 
it turned down takeover offers from amway corp an ada 
michbased directselling concern and from investor irwin jacobs 
amway made a bid of 21 billion and jacobs was worth 285 
billion together amway and jacobs hold about 10 percent of avons 
stock 
avon also shunned takeover feelers from mary kay corp vice 
chairman john p rochon who is involved in the newest advance on 
new yorkbased avon 
the chartwell group hasnt mentioned a price it would bid if it 
decides to pursue avon 
in the event of a takeover rochon ruled out the possibility of 
uniting the sales forces of avon and mary kay he also said in the 
summary of the sec filing that avon wouldnt be merged with mary 
kay a dallasbased doortodoor marketer of beauty products 
other options that will be reviewed by chartwell include 
purchasing more avon shares and launching a tender offer to buy 
stock from shareholders seeking to influence the management and 
policies of avon in some unspecified way or trying to put a 
nominee on avons board another option would be to sell some of 
its avon stock on the open market or in private transactions 
the general partners of chartwell have been identified as larry 
zachery arnold richard and anthony fisher a family of new york 
property developers and argonaut partners i headed by rochon the 
only limited partner is the gordon p getty family trust 
within argonaut is a group called new arrow corp a wholly 
owned subsidiary of mary kay cosmetics inc the principal unit of 
privately held mary kay corp which had revenue of about 400 
million last year 
there has been speculation on wall street that avon could have 
difficulty defending itself against chartwell due to the 
significant financial clout of getty and the fishers getty and the 
fisher brothers teamed up earlier this year in a bid for emhart 
corp that though unsuccessful was believed tohave earned the 
partners tens of millions of dollars

what have been called the maseratis of personal 
computers superfast machines based on intel corps new i486 
microprocessor took center stage at the worlds biggest computer 
expo monday 
the new personal computers on display at the fall comdex show 
are so fast they are expected to do work that otherwise would have 
gone to larger and more expensive minicomputers and even mainframes 
buyers are learning to hook together and manage whole networks 
of personal computers to run their businesses 
in the beginning pcs were considered toys they were 
automated typewriters said joe nahil the chief spokesman for 
compaq computer corp which is at the forefront of the 486based 
computer invasion 
486 is shorthand for intels i486 the central chip in the new 
generation of personal computers 
compaqs new topend 486 models can store up to 4 billion 
characters of information at a pricetag from 15000 up to 50000 
for specialized pcs that control networks 
if that sounds expensive consider that they are replacing 
machinery that costs far more 
were talking about using them to replace mainframes said 
alan gregolot of international business machines corp which was 
the first company to ship a commercial product using the 486 chips 
but competitors including compaq and hewlettpackard co say 
that because ibms power platform which contains the chip merely 
replaces a 386based board in an existing computer it does not 
take advantage of the speed and power of the 486 chips the way 
their computers specifically built around the 486 can do 
be that as it may gregolot was demonstrating monday how the 
entire property records for a small city including changes in lot 
lines over the years the location of every power pole and the 
history of every piece of equipment attached to the pole can be 
contained and managed in a machine that sits on a desk 
right now property appraisers in many cities still have 
draftsmen drawing lots by hand gregolot said 
with a program managed by the 486based computer information 
about say a zoning change could be called up immediately 
graphically displayed on a printout and fed into envelopes 
addressed to neighbors who might want to object to the change 
there were about a dozen of the 486based pcs on display monday 
at comdex the huge annual trade show held in las vegas each fall 
still observers expect many businesses to put off buying one of 
the machines flaws in intels 486 chips forced delays in compaqs 
release schedule for the new computers and ibm is working on 
computers designed to specifically take advantage of the 486 chips 
instead of merely putting them into a machine originally designed 
for the intel 80386 microprocessor which works only about half as 
fast 
ibm got a bigger chunk of the 386based pc market than compaq 
for the first time in the julyseptember quarter and ibms prices 
for its computers based on intel 286 and 386 chips are cheaper than 
compaqs according to stephen smith a painewebber inc analyst 
but compaqs move up with the 486based computers appears to 
position it squarely amid the market for the specialized pcs that 
control networks sales of the socalled network servers are 
booming at a time when sales growth of regular personal compters 
has slowed to 10 percent a year 
we think ibm is in big trouble said nihal the compaq 
spokesman

the changing makeup of the american family will 
offset declining population and keep demand for housing strong 
during the 1990s according to a study released monday 
the realtors meeting in dallas also released quarterly surveys 
of house prices and sales showing a 27 percent increase in resale 
prices of single family houses spurred by lower interest rates and 
recovering markets in the south and midwest 
meanwhile the national median price for a house rose 21 
percent to 95000 although there were wide regional differences 
the realtors said 
what weve got here is a picture of a housing market in which 
activity remains historically strong but varies across the 
country said john tuccillo the realtors chief economist 
its a market in which home prices are appreciating slightly 
greater than the rate of inflation but again with strong regional 
variations 
the study demographics in the us the segmenting of housing 
demand concluded the market for housing will be driven by 
changes in character of the nations population 
households comprised of a husband wife and children having 
comparable incomes and manifesting similar housing needs no long 
comprise the overwhelming majority of us households the study 
says 
todays households include large and increasing contingents of 
singles singleparents cohabiting couples elderly immigrants 
affluent and poor the study says moreover regional 
disparities in housing demand already substantial are likely to 
heighten as mobility migration and immigration rates also continue 
to increase 
the study says these changes will negate the effects of a 
declining population in the postbaby boom generation 
as the leading edge of the baby boom moves through its peak 
earning years demand will pick up for second homes and retirement 
homes tuccillo said demand will shift to smaller units in 
sunny climates 
high levels of migration and immigration will continue to mean 
high levels of housing demand in selected areas for example in the 
south and west regions the study says increasing population 
mobility coupled with increasing fluidity among household types is 
likely to mean higher rates of housing turnover throughout the 
country 
the healthy markets will offer diversity said outgoing 
president ira gribin they will have a variety of nicheoriented 
housing 
some of these niches identified include tradeups for current 
homeowners or smaller homes for retired persons 
the study also found a growing disparity in housing 
affordability between the highest and lowest income groups 
households toward the upper end of the income and wealth 
distributions are seen as enjoying sizeable gains in affluence 
thereby permitting substantially increased housing consumption for 
example by homeowners moving up 
on the other hand households near the lower end of the 
distributions whether because of lagging real earnings increased 
singleparent households or illfortune appear to be having 
increasing difficulty in obtaining suitable lowcost housing the 
study says 
as a result affordable housing is perceived as an increasing 
problem for many us families and individuals 
meanwhile the realtors found prices and activity were on the 
upswing in much of the country although even within regions there 
were significant differences 
nationally the median price was 95000 up from 93000 in the 
second quarter this year and a 53 percent increase from the third 
quarter last year 
the northeast region remains the most expensive with a median 
price of 147000 up from 145900 in the second quarter but just 
a 15 percent rise from the third quarter last year 
houses in the west have appreciated the most jumping 117 
percent from 126800 last year to 141600 this year 
the souths median price was 85800 an increase from the 
second quarters 83800 and a 31 percent from the same quarter 
last year in the midwest the median price was 72400 up from 
the second quarters 70900 and a 51 percent rise from last 
years 68900 
south dakota saw the largest percentage jump in resale of 
existing singlefamily detached homes town houses apartment 
condominiums and cooperatives increasing 316 percent from the 
second quarter in all 36 states and washington dc had 
increased resales 
utah has the largest decrease as resales there fell 146 
percent 
california led in the number of sales with 501600 almost twice 
as much as secondplace pennsylvania at 259900 placing third with 
226500 sales was texas where real estate values have been 
depressed following the collapse of energy prices in the mid1980s 
honolulu and the san francisco bay area remained the most 
expensive areas with median home prices of 275000 in honolulu 
and 269400 in san francisco orange county calif is the third 
most expensive at 249100 followed by los angeles at 224600 
peoria ill remained the least expensive with a median price 
of 48700 followed by spokane wash at 52700

boeing co is concentrating more on efforts to 
get a vote by striking production workers on a contract offer than 
on getting talks going again a company spokesman said monday 
on the 40th day of the walkout paul binder of boeing said 
company officials had not decided whether they would be willing to 
resume negotiations with the machinists union in the absence of a 
vote 
we havent taken any kind of position on that he said 
what we would like to do is to encourage a membership vote 
federal mediator doug hammond who has reconvened the bargaining 
teams twice without success since the strike began oct 4 said he 
didnt know when he might make a third attempt 
tom baker president of machinists district lodge 751 said 
there was still time to reach a settlement before thanksgiving 
i just hope that something will break here baker said 
id hope that they wont force the membership to go through any 
holidays thanksgiving and so on 
the union represents about 57800 boeing workers including 
43300 in the local district lodge 12000 in wichita kan 1700 
in portland ore and a few hundred at scattered sites in 
california hawaii utah montana wyoming north dakota and other 
states 
the latest talks ended nov 4 after six days with boeing 
offering a 3year contract calling for wage increases of 4 percent 
3 percent and 3 percent annual bonuses of 10 percent of gross pay 
4 percent and 4 percent a reduction in mandatory overtime from the 
current 200 hours a quarter to 144 hours by mid1990 and 
acrosstheboard increases in retirement benefits 
machinist union leaders rejected the offer saying it provided 
no more money than the one spurned in an 85 percent strike vote on 
oct 3 
reiterating that there would be no increase in the money 
package boeing officials have issued public statements taken out 
fullpage newspaper ads and mailed letters to the strikers homes 
in a campaign for a vote on the offer 
binder said that in close to 2000 calls to a company 
information phone line over the past week most of those expressing 
an opinion said they favored a vote 
baker said boeings campaign actually boosted support for union 
negotiators after widespread disappointment following the collapse 
in talks 
he said the number of hourly workers crossing picket lines in 
recent days was less than 2 percent in the puget sound area 
compared with less than 1 percent early in the strike 
its just as effective now as it was on nov 4 baker said 
binder said an average of more than 10 percent are crossing 
picket lines ranging from 5 percent in the puget sound area where 
union membership is mandatory to 35 percent to 36 percent in 
wichita where union membership is voluntary under state law 
that compares with company figures last week of 10 percent 
overall 4 percent in the puget sound area and 34 percent in 
wichita 
even if the company figures are accurate baker said its not 
enough to make any difference they cant build any airplanes 
spokesman tom cole of boeings commercial airplanes division 
said one 737300 was delivered friday to united airlines and 
another a day earlier to southwest airlines bringing total 
deliveries to 19 planes since the strike began 
another boeing spokesman jack gamble said another 18 or so 
planes also were virtually completed before the strike and probably 
could be delivered without the strikers 
on the production line however work has ground to a halt 
baker said the strike probably would run past saturday the 45th 
day exceeding the length of the last boeing walkout in 1977 and 
becoming the longest work stoppage at the worlds largest 
commercial airplane builder since a 4month strike in 1948

entertainment giant mca corps 
stock surged higher monday on renewed takeover speculation 
following reports that longtime chairman lew wasserman might be 
willing to consider dropping the companys resistance to a buyout 
however a spokesman for mca and some analysts said a statement 
by wasserman who reportedly told columnist dan dorfman that he 
would consider anything in the best interest of my shareholders 
was consistent with past mca policy 
dorfman commented on the possibility friday night on a cable 
news network show that was repeated monday morning 
mca finished up 562 at 6750 a share in active new york 
stock exchange trading 
the conglomerate which has interests in film television and 
music production and distribution amusement parks publishing and 
real estate fiercely has resisted buyout overtures in recent years 
the entertainment and media industry has undergone tremendous 
consolidation during that time 
in the latest major deal sony corp and columbia pictures 
entertainment entered a 34 billion takeover agreement in 
september earlier this year time inc and warner communications 
inc agreed to a 14 billion merger which would create the worlds 
largest media and entertainment concernm time warner inc 
a number of industry analysts have assessed mca stock as 
undervalued saying the company could be worth as much as it could 
rise to as 80 a share 
a secretary for wasserman who owns 7 percent of mcas 
outstanding shares declined a call seeking an interview monday and 
said the 76yearold chairman did not give interviews president 
and chief operating officer sidney sheinberg also declined an 
interview through his staff 
harold haas an mca spokesman said wassermans statement to 
dorfman was consistent with the policy of mca regarding 
takeovers 
analyst steve rosenberg of rose media agreed saying the stock 
surge was not big enough and wassermans reported statement to 
dorfman was not conclusive enough to speculate that mca is for sale 
they are a perennial takeover target and speculation after 
columbia going to sony is rife rosenberg said but i certainly 
wouldnt read any tea leaves into it believe me the stock will 
move a lot more than about four points if something is really 
happening 
unsubstantiated reports last march indicated sony was a possible 
interested buyer for mca 
in 1985 mca shareholders agreed to increase the number of 
common shares by 50 percent to 150 million on the basis of reports 
that rca was moving on the company 
the company strengthened its poison pill takeover defense in 
early 1988 after new york developer donald trump announced he had 
purchased a small stake in mca the plan takes effect once a raider 
acquires 10 percent of mcas outstanding shares

entertainer merv griffin announced 
monday he was offering resorts international inc bondholders 78 
percent of the casinos equity in a restructuring plan to reduce 
the companys nearly 1 billion debt 
bondholders on sunday filed suit in camden to place resorts in 
involuntary bankruptcy under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code 
said alison macdonald a new yorkbased spokeswoman for resorts 
resorts said in a release that it had reached agreement in 
principle with a number of substantial holders of its debt 
about a recapitalization plan 
as part of the agreement bondholders said they would keep court 
proceedings friendly and make the companys survival their ultimate 
goal according to resorts officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
marc s kirschner a new york attorney representing the senior 
bondholders said the agreement remains to be approved by 
twothirds of both sets of bondholders a process he said could 
take up to three months 
analysts disagreed on the merits of the deal with one calling 
the casinos future doubtful and another saying the restructuring 
will allow the gaming hall time to rebound from a 349 million 
thirdquarter loss 
resorts has said it does not expect its operations to be 
affected 
bondholders had until wednesday to file in bankruptcy court if 
they wanted to protect certain claims against griffin 
wednesday is the first anniversary of griffins victory over 
donald trump in a struggle for control of resorts under federal 
law bondholders have one year to force resorts into bankruptcy if 
they want to claim they were defrauded when the casino changed 
hands 
the deal would leave griffin with 22 percent of the gaming 
companys equity he would also retain the chairmans job and the 
right to appoint a majority of directors 
under the agreement griffin would invest 15 million in cash 
now and another 15 million a year from monday he also would set 
aside a 5 million fund to leave open the possibility of legal 
action against trump 
john barry an attorney for trump was not in his office monday 
and could not be reached for comment 
marvin roffman a gaming analyst for janney montgomery scott in 
philadelphia said griffin agreed to that portion of the deal to 
avoid the prospect of a bankruptcy judge finding him liable for his 
50 million withdrawal plus a 10 million in a personal letter of 
credit to resorts 
in august the company suspended interest payments on 925 
million in bonds and the following month announced a restructuring 
plan aimed at preventing a bankruptcy filing 
bondholders attacked the plan and have since split into two 
groups one holding 600 million of subordinated unsecured debt and 
another representing 325 million of senior secured debt 
those senior secured bondholders will receive 1875 million in 
new notes with a fouryear term bearing interest of 6 percent in 
the first year 9 percent in the second 12 percent in the third 
and 15 percent in the final year according to the restructuring 
plan they also will receive 25 percent of resorts stock 
rent payments on property owned by the showboat hotel and casino 
will also finance 100 million in new 10year bonds to those 
bondholders 
junior bondholders will swap their debt for 755 percent of the 
companys equity and 1135 in new bonds 
roffman said the senior bondholders have a much better chance 
of coming out smelling like a rose because resorts debt will be 
reduced by more than 600 million as a result of junior bondholders 
exchanging their debt for 75 percent of the companys shares 
whats 75 percent of nothing though roffman asked 
questioning the longterm viability of resorts which faces the 
opening next door of trumps massive taj mahal casino in the spring 
as well as the prospects of a declining economy 
resorts also needs millions of dollars worth of renovation 
which casino officials attributed as a factor in the thirdquarter 
financial results 
casino analyst john uphoff of raymond james amp associates in st 
petersburg fla said griffin made key concessions which could 
save resorts 
in the longterm the taj could create more activity at that 
end of the boardwalk uphoff said therell be 4000 people 
there each night and theyll be wandering one way to the showboat 
and one way to resorts 
many analysts think griffin paid an exorbitant price for 
resorts the oldest casino on the boardwalk trump ended up with 
the unfinished taj mahal megacasino for 230 million less than 
half the 500 million resorts poured into its construction

tie had cleared the way for the free press and the detroit news to 
partially merge their operations 
whoever said a tie was like kissing your sister didnt have it 
quite right meriwether said 
since 1986 knightridder inc owner of the free press and 
gannett co inc owner of the news had been seeking to merge 
their business circulation and advertising departments editorial 
departments would remain separate 
were joined at the wallet but not at the heart said joe 
swickard a free press court reporter 
the joint operating agreement or joa will begin on nov 27 
and the first joint issue will come out dec 2 said william 
keating president of the detroit newspaper agency which will 
handle the newspapers combined operations the newspaper will 
publish joint issues on saturdays and sundays 
this guarantees that there will be two editorial voices in the 
detroit community for a long time 100 years according to the 
terms of the contract keating said 
the tie vote by the nations highest court meant that earlier 
court decisions upholding the joint operating agreement would 
stand justice byron r white had excused himself from the case for 
undisclosed personal reasons 
the michigan citizens for an independent press an organization 
which challenged the arrangement will not ask the court for a 
rehearing said group vice president matt beer 
however beer said giving up the detroit fight didnt mean the 
door was open for other newspapers to form such mergers weve 
created enough thin ice that anyone else who applies for a joa will 
do so carefully he said 
another opponent the public citizen litigation group may seek 
a rehearing organization attorney william schultz said in 
washington such a rehearing is seldom granted schultz 
acknowledged 
he and beer noted that the courts decision came without an 
opinion so no one knows the justices thinking behind their vote 
michigan attorney general frank kelley said he was disappointed 
that the court didnt issue an opinion he said his office was 
considering asking for a rehearing 
the joa request brought under the newspaper preservation act of 
1970 said the free press would fail without the deal 
knightridder had said if the plan were not adopted it would close 
the 158yearold detroit newspaper 
louis mleczko president of local 22 of the newspaper guild 
said he was disappointed with the decision the guild was the last 
of the newspapers unions to drop opposition to the arrangement 
no more separate papers on weekends no more morning detroit 
newses nor more sunday free presses theyve known it in the past 
no more detroit news as theyve known it in the past he said 
advertisers are going to see skyrocketing advertising rates after 
a short period of time 
some free press employees expressed relief and joy as well as 
concern for about 500 workers who will lose their jobs when the joa 
takes effect the free press has 2200 employees and the news 
about 2300 
officials with some suburban newspapers said the partial merger 
would be bad news for them too joining the two detroit papers 
advertising departments could present smaller papers with a huge 
nearmonopoly on newspaper advertising forcing them to boost 
advertising rates opponents have said 
what it means is that like all news publishers in southeast 
michigan we will be busy reprinting our advertising rate 
cards said ed wendover publisher and editor of the community 
crier a weekly paper serving plymouth and canton 25 miles west of 
detroit

european finance ministers on monday 
listened sympathetically to britains alternative approach for 
closer european monetary ties but did not wholeheartedly endorse 
it according to a british official 
john major britains chancellor of the exchequer told a news 
conference that the plan would be discussed next month at a summit 
in strasbourg france of the leaders of the 12nation european 
community 
there is no doubt in my mind that the british paper was taken 
very seriously by the delegations he said 
he acknowledged that it wasnt universally applauded there 
were mixed views about it but it had a good deal of support 
major attending his first ec meeting as britains top treasury 
official replaced nigel lawson who quit last month in a policy 
dispute with prime minister margaret thatcher lawsons resignation 
rocked the british government 
other european finance officials have expressed concern that the 
british approach could slow the movement toward full economic and 
monetary union of the dozen nations of the trading bloc also 
called the common market 
earlier this month the british government unveiled what it 
described as its marketbased approach to the development of 
closer monetary ties it calls for removing restrictions so that 
all the european currencies would be legal tender acceptable for 
savings and transactions throughout the community 
the british have offered their plan as an alternative to 
sweeping proposals that would lead to a common currency and central 
bank system the recommendations were laid out in a report drawn up 
last spring by a panel of european central bankers the committee 
was led by jacques delors president of the european commission 
the communitys executive body 
the delors plan sets out three stages for implementing monetary 
union leaders of the ec nations agreed at a summit last june in 
madrid to go ahead with the first stage generally calling for 
closer economic and monetary ties 
at mondays meeting the finance ministers gave a green light to 
proposals setting the framework for closer consultations among the 
nations on economic and monetary matters that framework would be 
part of the first phase of the monetary plan which is scheduled to 
begin july 1 
as part the first phase all currencies would be linked in the 
exchange rate mechanism of the european monetary system which 
keeps their values roughly steady within certain bands the 
currencies of britain greece and portugal remain outside the 
linkage 
mrs thatcher who has long resisted entering the pound into the 
system agreed at the madrid summit to do so but only under certain 
conditions she gave no timetable 
major reiterated britains objections to the later stages of the 
delors report i made it clear that the united kingdom has 
very considerable worries about stages two and three he said 
mrs thatcher has argued that the radical moves to a joint 
currency and central bank system would force nations to give up 
some of their sovereignty to new institutions 
the move toward monetary union would enlarge on the communitys 
push to create a single market in late 1992 by lifting the barriers 
that bar the free movement of people money goods and services

the investment group condor partners took a step 
monday toward wresting control of ual corp from its board of 
directors which in turn authorized its financial adviser to 
explore alternatives to a takeover of the parent of united airlines 
condor formed as a takeover vehicle by the new york investment 
group coniston partners gained access to a list of ual 
stockholders monday by submitting certain documents to the company 
this enables the group to send consent solicitation materials to 
the stockholders seeking their approval for removing certain board 
members 
the documents did not disclose the terms or financing of any 
proposals that coniston might contemplate the board said in a 
statement after it met monday 
the board said it has authorized its financial adviser first 
boston corp to explore potential transactions with third 
parties including actively determining available alternative 
transactions such as employee ownership or recapitalization 
the board said it has not received any offers from third parties 
coniston announced nov 3 that it owned 97 percent of ual and 
wanted to direct a sale recapitalization or other extraordinary 
transaction involving the chicagobased company 
coniston also wants to reduce uals board from 16 members to 
five three of whom would be coniston principals 
the board said monday that the two directors coniston wants to 
retain stephen wolf and frank olson have indicated they would not 
serve on any ual board controlled by coniston wolf is uals 
chairman president and chief executive officer 
mondays board meeting was the first since directors freed wolf 
to explore new options following a collapsed employee effort to buy 
the company 
uals shares closed monday at 19325 up 375 in consolidated 
new york stock exchange trading 
samuel buttrick an airline analyst with kidder peabody amp co in 
new york said that given the failure of the 675 billion buyout 
bid by uniteds pilots a management team and british airways plc 
there are significant numbers of ual shareholders who are 
sympathetic toward coniston 
speculators want to see ual sold or recapitalized quickly to 
minimize their losses following the oct 13 collapse of the 
300ashare bid from the pilotmanagement group 
if i were on the board i would assume that there are 
sufficient shares held by accounts sympathetic to coniston that 
would result in a majority vote against the board buttrick said 
analysts said ual began its defense against conistons attempt 
to seize control of its board when it gave wolf permission to seek 
a buyout or recapitalization 
it would seem that one obvious alternative to coniston is 
for wolf to put together a managementlabor team to buy out the 
company said analyst louis marckesano of janney montgomery scott 
inc in philadelphia 
failing that he could put together a restructuring similar to 
what happened with allegis 
allegis corp the former parent of united was broken up in 
1987 after coniston obtained a 14 percent stake in the company and 
demanded an end to its diversification within the travel industry 
in response to the pressure allegis sold its westin and hilton 
international hotel operations and its hertz car rental business 
marckesano said there are difficulties associated with a 
recapitalization because ual has few assets to sell to raise cash 
he noted that ual has cash on hand and could sell its aircraft 
and lease them back 
the best alternative is a managementlabor buyout 
marckesano said 
officials of the air line pilots association chapter at united 
met last week with coniston principals and financier saul 
steinberg a friend of wolf who is seeking government permission to 
buy more than 15 percent of ual 
pilots said they have discussed a revised bid with ual 
management but they hinted last week that they might resume a work 
slowdown in effect earlier this year unless the ual board recommits 
in the next two weeks to majority employee ownership 
uniteds machinists who opposed the failed buyout bid also met 
last week with coniston principals 
they say they wont support any highly leveraged deal that could 
threaten the airlines viability or that would involve wolf

the home video rights to a sovietdesigned 
video game called tetris belong to nintendo rather than rival atari 
games corp a federal judge said monday 
us district judge fern smith cancelled a scheduled trial and 
said she would rule that nintendo owned the rights to the game in 
june she halted sales of tetris by an atari games subsidiary 
tengen inc which had started marketing the game in may 
we expect tetris to be one of our topselling titles for the 
holidays said richard lindner a spokesman for nintendo the 
japanese company is marketing the game for both home video systems 
and handheld video machines 
morgan chu a lawyer for atari games and tengen said the ruling 
would be appealed he noted that the ruling does not prevent atari 
games from continuing to produce tetris for coinoperated video 
games and personal computers 
nintendo also is seeking damages for profits tengen made from 
its home video sales of the game smith urged the companies to try 
to resolve that issue and others in the case 
the dispute is an offshoot of a 100 million suit filed last 
december by atari games against nintendo whose us subsidiary 
controls 80 percent of the us market for home video game machines 
atari games contends nintendo is violating antitrust laws by 
limiting the number of games it makes under licensing agreements 
with software developers and using a lockout computer chip 
that prevents the software writers from independently making games 
that are compatible with the nintendo system 
nintendo says atari games is violating nintendos patent by 
making games that can be played on nintendo machines atari games 
based in milpitas is unrelated to computermaker atari inc 
players in tetris developed by soviet programmers manipulate 
geometric shapes to form prescribed patterns 
nintendo said it negotiated the home video rights to the game 
from the soviet foreign trade agency elorg that agency previously 
granted certain rights to the game to a british firm that was the 
source of tengens license 
but nintendo said elorg had intended the british license to 
apply only to personal computers and not to home video games 
nintendo said the soviets were surprised and angry to learn that 
tengen claimed an exclusive license for home video production 
nintendo submitted statements from the soviet developers of the 
game to smith

nynex corp said it had reached a tentative 
agreement monday with its two unions to end a bitter 100day strike 
after agreeing to pay health care costs but a union leader said 
its leaders hadnt granted approval 
an agreement would end the last of a series of walkouts that hit 
regional phone companies last summer 
a spokesman for one of the unions the communications workers of 
america said they would resume discussions on the proposal tuesday 
morning union heads recessed talks late monday 
union and company spokesmen said however that striking 
telephone employees could return to work as early as next monday 
we have saved our health care there are no premiums cwa 
president morton bahr told the aflcio convention monday in 
washington 
nynex officials said the company only agreed to pay the health 
benefits after eliminating its offers of a partial lump sum payment 
of wage increases and profit sharing 
nynex chairman william c ferguson said in a statement the 
health benefits arrangement was a realistic solution to a very 
difficult set of issues facing not only the company but the entire 
nation 
nynex through its subsidiaries new york telephone and new 
england telephone provides phone service in most of the northeast 
cwa representing 40000 nynex workers and the international 
brotherhood of electrical workers which bargains for an additional 
20000 employees struck the company aug 6 resisting its attempt 
to shift health insurance costs to workers 
theres an awful lot of light at the end of the tunnel said 
steve rosenthal a cwa spokesman in new york the health issue 
has been resolved and that was the largest issue 
rosenthal said a tentative agreement would be reached if a 
committee of key union representatives meeting in rye north of new 
york city decided it liked the offer minor issues would still need 
to be worked out and the agreement would have to be put to a 
membership vote 
one ibew member stephen st peter said in boston that the 
contract in addition to fully companypaid health benefits 
provides for a 3 percent salary hike in the first year and 1 
percent raises in the second and third years in addition to a 
costofliving increase of 2 percent to 5 percent 
bahr said he had returned to washington monday morning from a 
negotiating session that began sunday morning and had concluded 
with the agreement on the companywide framework 
still to be resolved are local issues such as specific job 
titles and work rules at the nynex subsidiaries 
the single issue was a fight to protect health care benefits 
that were negotiated fought for struck for over 25 years of 
collective bargaining bahr said 
he said he was proud the unions had fought back the attempt to 
shift health care costs but said neither side could claim a victory 
both sides paid a very heavy penalty for miscalculations by 
management bahr said they have undoubtedly lost business to 
nonunion competitors which will have an adverse impact on us and 
our members are in the 15th week of a strike to protect what they 
had 
strikes that began aug 6 affected three other regional phone 
companies around the country ameritech in the midwest pacific 
telesis in the west and bell atlantic in the west all were settled 
by the end of august

the nations top thrift regulator said monday 
he has no intention of resigning despite president bushs assertion 
that he is not closing the door on replacing him 
the president has indicated that he too wants to hear the 
other side of the story m danny wall head of the treasury 
departments office of thrift supervison told reporters the 
other side needs to be heard from in a timely way 
wall has been the target of hearings by the house banking 
committee into why he waited two years to seize lincoln savings and 
loan association after government sampl examiners concluded that the 
irvine calif thrift was being operated unsoundly 
but while the panels chairman rep henry b gonzalez dtexas 
has directed his fire against wall the shrapnel has hit five 
senators who intervened on lincolns behalf with walls predecessor 
in early 1987 after receiving a total of 13 million in political 
gifts raised by lincolns owner 
wall said monday that two of those senators also had contacted 
him about lincoln after he took over as head of the federal home 
loan bank board the predecessor of the treasury department agency 
in july 1987 
all five senators dennis deconcini dariz john mccain 
rariz alan cranston dcalif donald riegle jr dmich and 
john glenn dohio are now the focus of inquires by the senate 
ethics committee and the fbi into their ties with phoenix 
millionaire charles h keating jr chairman of lincolns parent 
company 
government sources speaking on the condition of anonymity said 
monday the fbi has interviewed edwin j gray who was walls 
predecessor as the banks board chairman until july 1987 and 
grays assistant shannon fairbanks about an april 2 1987 meeting 
with all of the senators but riegle 
both testified at a hearing last week that deconcini who 
received 48000 in campaign gifts from keating a phoenix 
millionaire and his associates asked him at the meeting to 
withdraw a regulation that would have curtailed lincolns risky 
investments 
deconcini has denied making the request and the three other 
senators present either denied hearing it or said they cannot 
recall it being made 
wall said monday that riegle chairman of the senate banking 
committee and gonzalez asked him in a joint letter shortly after 
president bush signed a 157 million sampl bailout bill in august to 
keep a record of congressional inquries about specific enforcement 
actions 
a system for doing that has not been completed yet wall said 
wall said he has been questioned by the fbi in criminal 
investigations into several thrifts but not about any contacts 
with the five senators 
bush acknowledging that concerns about the relationship between 
lincoln and its regulators has reached the white house has said he 
intends to respond fairly soon to a written request by gonzalez 
three weeks ago to replace wall 
im not closing the door on it i just dont know at this 
juncture bush said but when the question is put if part of 
the savings and loan problem proves to be me management or 
regulation people that arent aggressive enough would you make 
changes the answer is yes 
wall a former banking aide to sen jake garn rutah on monday 
interpreted bushs remark as only an indication that he wants to 
hear both sides before making any judgment 
he said no one at the white house has talked with him about the 
house banking or senate ethics committee probes and repeated his 
complaint that after four weeks of hearings he has still not 
testified 
walls tentatively scheduled appearances before the committee 
have been postponed twice by gonzalez he is now scheduled to 
testify on nov 21 the same day that keating has been subpoenaed 
to appear 
the president is a lawyer by training and clearly he know 
that one is innocent until proven guilty wall said and 
certainly one has to have an opportunity to respond to the 
questions that are raised 
in fact bush is not a lawyer 
gonzalez meanwhile said monday he hopes bush really 
considers removing wall its a shame that wall didnt remove 
himself on his own initiative he added 
answering reporters questions wall said cranston called him 
in august or september of 1987 asking why a yearlong examination 
of lincoln by bank board regulators in san franciso had not been 
completed keating interests gave cranston or projects in which he 
was interested 974000 
wall said he also received a phone call from cranston and two 
from deconcini earlier this year urging prompt bank board 
consideration of three different offers by private investors to buy 
the troubled thrift before it was seized by the government in april 
none of the offers was acceptable to the bank board wall said 
but he added that he considered all of the calls from the senators 
appropriate
