republican gubernatorial nominee clayton williams 
disclosed that he paid prostitutes for sex a number of times in 
mexico and his native west texas a newspaper reported sunday 
he said it has been at least 35 years since he visited a 
prostitute and considered it a rite of passage 
why of course williams 58 told the houston post when 
asked whether he ever paid women for sex 
its part of growing up in west texas its like the larry 
mcmurtry book the last picture show the midland rancher and 
oilman said the book is about teenage affairs in a small texas 
town in 1951 
williams told the post he first paid for sex at age 16 
in addition to patronizing prostitutes as a teenager williams 
said he paid for sex while a student at texas aampm university 
williams who faces democratic state treasurer ann richards in 
the november gubernatorial general election and has campaigned as a 
lawandorder candidate said the disclosure has no bearing on his 
leadership capabilities as a mature adult 
prostitution is illegal in texas and was illegal 35 years ago 
it is legal in parts of mexico 
a call by the associated press to the richards campaign late 
saturday was answered by a machine 
the post interviewed williams at a posh desert resort in 
scottsdale ariz where he was spending the weekend for the annual 
meeting of the allamerican wildcatters a fraternity of sorts for 
independent oilmen 
the colorful millionaire never before elected to public office 
has sunk 56 million of his own money in an 8 million campaign 
williams came under fire from womens groups and political 
opponents last month when he jokingly likened bad weather to rape 
saying if it was inevitable to just relax and enjoy it 
the day after he made the remark williams apologized and said 
he realized his comment was insensitive 
during a visit to washington earlier last month williams told 
reporters he would feel uncomfortable running against a woman 
williams and his wife modesta celebrate their 25th wedding 
anniversary next month they have three children including two 
adopted teenage boys williams also has two children from a 
previous marriage 
as she did when her husband faced heat for the rape remark 
modesta williams stood by him saturday on the subject of 
prostitution the post reported 
what he did before we were married is certainly his business 
that doesnt bother me at all she said

beirut televisions englishlanguage news bulletin quoted an 
unidentified syrian official as saying the hostage would be freed 
sometime on sunday probably in the morning by islamic jihad for 
the liberation of palestine 
the hostage will be produced at the syrian foreign ministry 
and then handed over to us ambassador edward djerejian said 
the station which is based in moslem west beirut it did not 
elaborate 
its sister station in christian east beirut later broadcast the 
same report which could not be independently verified 
the reports predicting steens release were broadcast sunday by 
the prestigious moslemrun voice of the nation and the voice of the 
people a communistrun station in west beirut 
voice of the nation said steen will be freed in line with the 
ostentatious behavior of the hostageholders 
steen suffers from chronic high blood pressure in the early 
days of his captivity the kidnappers reported he was gravely ill 
and near death but he appeared on a videotape released in may 1987 
and said he had recovered 
earlier saturday an iranian daily that usually reflects the 
thinking of irans president urged the lebanese kidnappers to keep 
their promise to free an american hostage despite their claim that 
washington was delaying the release 
the tehran times which has repeatedly called for the release of 
all western hostages in lebanon over the last three months said in 
an editorial that the release could be the prelude to the release 
of one more hostage by another group 
daryl penner spokesman for the us embassy in damascus 
stressed saturday that washington will not send john kelly 
assistant secretary of state for near east affairs to negotiate 
the release as demanded by the kidnappers 
syrian foreign ministry sources however said the us embassy 
had requested and been granted permission to land a plane at 
damascus airport 
us embassy officials declined comment but the sources said 
the plane was believed to be to fly a released hostage to 
wiesbaden west germany 
american captives released in the past have been flown to the 
us military hospital there for medical checks and debriefing a 
us team flew there thursday

contradict the report according to the official 
white house chief of staff john sununu gave no indication the 
bush administration had any confirmation of a sunday release 
youre always hopeful but having gone through frustrations 
over the years i think everybody involved in this is going to 
believe it only after it happens sununu told cbs news on 
saturday 
the captors said wednesday they would free an american within 48 
hours and they demanded kelly go to damascus to finalize 
arrangements 
but the following day the group declared the release postponed 
indefinitely after president bush citing us policy not to 
negotiate with terrorists refused to send kelly to syria 
the tehran times an englishlanguage daily said in an 
editorial saturday that us ambassador djerejian is good enough 
to conduct the arrangements for the release of the hostage 
djerejian has been involved in frequent talks with syrian officials 
since returning to damascus thursday 
the iranian newspaper which is close to president hashemi 
rafsanjani expressed impatience with the postponement and said it 
hoped the freeing of one captive could be the prelude to the 
release of one more hostage by another group 
it did not specify which proiranian faction it meant by 
another group there are 18 westerners currently held in 
lebanon 
rafsanjani leader of tehrans socalled pragmatists has been 
seeking for months to free the hostages as part of his efforts to 
improve irans relations with the west after a decade of hostility 
he believes that securing the release of hostages will encourage 
western companies to invest in iran to boost its limping economy 
and hopefully encourage washington to release an estimated 12 
billion in frozen assets 
the iranian leader is opposed by fundamentalist antiwestern 
radicals in the tehran hierarchy 
an aide to hussein musawi shiite moslem mentor of islamic jihad 
for the liberation of palestine said saturday that musawi remains 
sure that the group will free one of the americans it holds 
but the aide contacted by telephone by the associated press 
gave no indication when that might be

syriancontrolled bekaa valley in east lebanon he said friday he 
believed the release will go ahead despite washingtons arrogant 
cowboy behavior

pope john paul ii on sunday 
called for an unprecedented meeting of european bishops to allow 
the church to keep pace with the political changes sweeping the 
continent 
he made the announcement as he visited a shrine in moravia 
dedicated to cyril and methodius who introduced christianity to 
the slavs 12 centuries ago the old communist regime barred him 
from visiting here in 1985 
john paul said the meeting called a synod will be held at a 
not too distant date 
papal spokesmen joaquin navarro said he did not expect it would 
be held this year he said details will be announced in rome on 
tuesday 
the synod would be the first such continentwide summit bringing 
together bishops from all european countries 
today in this very place we are seeing the signs of a new 
blessing in the promising travail of deep and vital 
transformations said the pope speaking from an altar at a 
700yearold basilica 
he said the european bishops should have the opportunity to 
reflect more on the historic moment for europe and the church 
navarro also announced the pope may visit cuba in december the 
pope had earlier accepted an invitation to visit the caribbean 
island ruled by a hardline communist government but no date had 
been set 
before the mass the pontiff rode through the cobblestone 
streets of velehrad in central czechoslovakia in his white 
popemobile crowds chanted long live the holy father 
as john paul prepared to say mass outside the basilica redone 
in baroque style in the 17th century a huge throng gathered the 
worshipers included polish prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki who 
in august became the east blocs first noncommunist government 
leader 
the czechoslovak news agency ctk estimated the crowd at 200000 
to 400000 
archbishop frantisek vanak of olomouc welcomed john paul to the 
altar the archbishop referred to the popes frustrated attempt to 
visit velehrad in 1985 for a feast to celebrate 1100 years of 
christianity in czechoslovakia 
czechoslovakias leaders who were then communist refused 
permission for the papal visit to this city where cyril and 
methodius introduced christianity to the slavs 
this visit was preceded by years of yearning to have you the 
pope christs witness here among us this yearning was growing 
all the more and more as the dark forces tried to hinder it 
vanak said but gods cause prevailed 
the pope has made the celebration of eastern europes toppling 
of communism a major theme of his twoday trip which began 
saturday it is his first to the region since the dramatic changes 
that rocked communist regimes last year 
until the communist regime fell such a trip was impossible 
but john paul is also warning eastern european countries about 
viruses from the west such as secularism hedonism and atheism 
after celebrating the mass at velehrad the pope was to fly 90 
miles to bratislava the capital of slovakia for another openair 
service 
statistics released by the vatican estimate 107 million 
catholics live in czechoslovakia out of a population of 156 
million 
the pope who turns 70 next month was making the 46th foreign 
pilgrimage of his pontificate

evelyn dietrich wrapped a hot 
sausage at her snack bar in heiligenstadts tiny market square 
then glanced to see how many customers a visiting west german 
competitor was getting 
sometimes its hard to believe theres a border anymore she 
said 
politicians still debate when and how germanys division will 
end officially but practical unification is happening rapidly 
along the hilly frontier 
heiligenstadt population 16000 and other east german border 
towns are at the heart of the change 
west german department stores advertise regularly in the town 
newspapers offering everything from pantyhose to chain saws 
social gatherings of east and west germans are as common as walking 
across the street for a neighborly visit 
west german businessmen anticipating future profits stock the 
stores with electronic goods and clothing west german beer is a 
favorite in the taverns 
in heiligenstadt ms dietrichs stand is next to a huge sausage 
van run by an entrepreneur from nearby eschwege west germany 
our prices are far better than his so we dont have any 
trouble keeping our customers she said in fact some of our 
best customers are from the west 
over easter thousands of mercedes bmws volkswagens and other 
west german cars plied the narrow road that winds through the hills 
to heiligenstadt a spa that retains some of its old charm despite 
decades of communist neglect and coalbefouled air 
east german border officials waved them through often without 
even a cursory check 
west germanys currency is not expected to replace the east 
german mark until summer as part of an economic union in which 
west germans probably will run most of the business but an 
unofficial merger is under way 
west german business people have swarmed across the border 
checking out market prospects and buildings where they can open 
stores preparing for the day when doing business in east germany 
will be much the same as at home 
stateowned east german stores are selling west german goods 
eastern bank accounts are being filled with the east mark profits 
of west german businessmen who hope for a bonanza when the 
deutschemark bcomes east germanys legal tender 
uwe fritsch 30 runs a shop in nearby muehlhausen that once 
sold secondhand goods but now stocks electronics goods from west 
germany 
last week a truck came in loaded with cassette recorders and 
other products he said everything was sold out within three 
days we had to hand over some of the goods to other shops in 
muehlhausen because we didnt have the personnel to deal with it 
fritsch said the prices of west german televisions and stereos 
were lower than those of comparable domestic goods cost which were 
rarely available 
coming together also causes problems 
west germans are buying up vast quantities of east german goods 
at relatively low statesubsidized prices creating hostility among 
their poorer cousins 
property ownership is another sore point 
mayor bernd beck cited many instances of west germans who 
once lived in heiligenstadt trying to claim property they left 
behind 
there are some who once owned businesses here and want them 
back he said 
beck said nothing can be done until the two germanys agree on 
how to settle the claims and added we cant throw anybody out 
on the street that wouldnt be fair 
east germans fear thousands of jobs will be lost as the planned 
economy is replaced by freemarket operations 
people are very uneasy about what the price of economic union 
with the west will be said roswitha vogler who works at a meat 
market in muellhausen 
economists have said up to 2 million east german jobs could be 
lost because many factories and businesses will lose out to 
competitors from the wealthy west 
west german products have been something of a mixed blessing for 
east germans 
even though electronic goods are generally cheaper and more 
plentiful some other western products cost up to three times what 
east germans are used to paying 
employees of a womens store said they still sell only east 
german clothing because few people in heiligenstadt could afford 
items made in the west 
when customers have a choice of most goods however the 
domestic product usually loses out 
from juice to lemonade to yogurt theres so much from over 
there fritsch said our people crave goods from the golden 
west but leave products made here sitting on the shelves

judy kersetter remembers when her mother 
used to wander in the house stopping only to pick up newspapers or 
magazines that she couldnt even read 
but that was before martha young 77 began attending an 
alzheimers daycare center last year the center is run by 
intergenerational services inc which may stop operating at the 
end of the month because of a dispute with an insurance company 
over whether its services can be considered psychotherapy 
shes more alert much more responsive she seems more aware 
of whats going on around her and her communication skills have 
improved tremendously said mrs kersetter who has been taking 
care of her mother for the last five years 
nationwide insurance the carrier for medicare in ohio began 
rejecting claims for the agencys services oct 1 the 
columbusbased insurance company contends intergenerationals 
programs are recreational and social and do not qualify as 
psychotherapy under medicare guidelines 
nationwide and intergenerational agree that medicares 
guidelines on what constitutes psychotherapy treatment for 
alzheimers are vague 
medicare carriers are paid to apply judgment to the claims 
that are being filed and we have to use very basic and vague 
guidelines said jeannine keating nationwides manager of 
administrative support services i think if you ask most people 
what they consider to be psychotherapy its not sitting five 
people in a circle playing bean bag 
intergenerational says nationwide is trying to drive the agency 
out of business because of the amount of its claims 
caught in the middle are 2000 families who depend on 
intergenerational programs to help family members with alzheimers 
a degenerative brain disorder that slowly robs its victims of 
memory and intellectual functioning the agency also helps people 
with other forms of dementia or severely diminished mental 
capacity 
im very worried said mrs kersetter whose mother has been 
going to the center four days a week if the services stop 
shell regress rapidly shell lose the ability to respond shell 
become very passive vegetative 
intergenerational a nonprofit agency founded five years ago in 
toledo offers what the agency considers to be psychotherapy 
services to victims of alzheimers and related dementia in 66 
nursing homes in 15 northwest ohio counties 
the agency said it would close by the end of the month unless 
nationwide changes its policy 
since october more than 40000 claims totaling about 11 
million have not been paid to intergenerational the agency depends 
on medicare for 80 percent of its 25 million annual budget 
nationwide withheld payments pending a hearing last month by a 
company examiner the examiner ruled that the payments were not 
medically necessary intergenerational has appealed the decision 
susan lemle intergenerationals program director said the 
services may appear to be simple but they help patients become 
more sociable and ease depression 
we do some singing do different things to get people to 
interact with each other ms lemle said for instance we 
might have them introduce themselves to each other shake hands 
maybe play games with another person we might do some kind of word 
game or pick a specific topic of the day all this gives them an 
opportunity to talk about things theyve done in the past it 
raises their selfesteem 
medicare does not have specific guidelines involving 
psychotherapy for alzheimers patients said steven arney chief of 
carrier operations for the federal health care finance 
administration which runs medicare 
but he said intergenerationals problem is that most of the 
agencys programs while they are under the general supervision of 
doctors are not conducted by licensed psychotherapists and 
therefore cannot be fully reimbursed if the insurance company 
running the medicare program in ohio chooses not to reimburse at 
all arney said such a decision would be within the federal 
guidelines 
arney said he knew of no other program in the country serving 
alzheimers patients where a similar dispute over whether to define 
it as psychotherapy has arisen 
intergenerational which began at the suggestion of a toledo 
nursing home has trained seven agencies in ohio to begin similar 
programs ms keating said nationwide will examine the other 
programs after the intergenerational case 
well be looking at more than intergenerational well take 
appropriate action once the investigation is concluded ms 
keating said 
meantime a group known as advocates for alzheimers victims is 
circulating petitions asking that nationwide resume medicare 
funding to the agency it intends to present them to state 
legislators to pressure nationwide to reverse its policy eleven 
area chapters of the american association of retired persons are 
helping 
were fighting for our lives reber said and if we lose 
its the people with alzheimers who are going to suffer

300 people in and around this northeast texas town after an old oil 
well began leaking a harmful gas 
the leak of hydrogen sulfide was discovered about 530 am and

ambassador edward l rowny urged the soviet 
union on sunday to follow up on its admission of guilt in the 1940 
massacre of thousands of polish officers in the katyn forest and 
tell the whole truth about all such acts in its history 
rowny who is president bushs special adviser on arms control 
said that while soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has made real 
progress in filling in the blank spots in soviet history the 
conscience of the world demands that it do more 
genocidal totalitarianism didnt start with stalin rowny 
said in remarks prepared for delivery at a ceremony in jersey city 
nj sponsored by polishamerican organizations at the katyn 
forest memorial a text of his remarks was released in washington 
we must be very clear on this point because communisms 
apologists would like us to believe that all the blood on moscows 
hands is the fault of the stalinist personality cult and not of 
communism itself rowny said 
for the soviet authorities to admit to the full scope of 
communisms crimes will be painful but it will also be a purifying 
step he said that is why we continue to challenge the soviet 
regime to renounce totalitarianism and all of its works

romanian dictator nicolae ceausescu wept silently 
and his wife elena begged for mercy as soldiers readied them for 
the firing squad according to footage of their execution broadcast 
sunday 
extracts of the graphic 90minute videotape were aired 
exclusively by the french television network tf1 they are the most 
detailed look yet at the execution dec 25 at a military base 
outside bucharest the ceausescus were executed days after being 
toppled by a popular revolution 
dont attack us we have the right to die the way we want 
elena ceausescu told soldiers and the 10person civilianmilitary 
tribunal that sentenced the couple to death 
children mrs ceausescu sniffed at the soldiers who tied 
her hands behind her back you are bruising my hands this is 
shameful why why i raised you all like a mother 
nicolae ceausescu who ruled romania with an iron fist for a 
quartercentury struggled briefly with the soldiers but said 
nothing tears rolled down his cheeks 
soldiers placed the couple who were not blindfolded against a 
brick wall and others rapidly opened fire emptying their 
magazines the ceausescus crumpled under the bullets which also 
peppered the brick wall 
a medic then looked for signs of life in the eyes of elena 
ceausescu as blood poured from her head he found none 
subsequent images showed nicolae ceausescu embalmed and prepared 
for burial his face appeared broken and gray 
gelu voican the graybearded civilian who organized the 
proceedings later was filmed before the two graves where he said 
the ceausescus were buried in an orthodox ceremony 
voican serves as vice prime minister in the interim government 
headed by prime minister ion iliescu elections to form a new 
government are scheduled for late may

laying before the brick wall

about half of city dwellers in the third world 
are squatters living in homemade shacks or mud huts on borrowed 
land with no electricity or plumbing 
even in industrialized nations such as the soviet union 
extended families live cheek by jowl in aging highrises and in 
the united states a growing number of people can barely afford 
housing or are homeless despite record levels of homebuilding 
during the last 40 years 
its safe to say theres hardly a country in the world that 
has found a solution to adequate housing said norman flynn 
president of the national association of realtors which is 
sponsoring a washington conference on the world housing dilemma 
this week 
following an opening speech by housing secretary jack kemp on 
tuesday representatives from 350 public and private organizations 
from more than 65 countries will examine case studies from 13 
nations describing their housing experiences and ideas for 
improvements 
the meeting will focus on increasing the private sectors 
involvement in lowincome housing 
one of the major problems in developing countries is the mass 
migration of rural residents to cities in search of better lives 
said michael cohen director of the world banks urban division 
in 1950 there were 273 million people living in urban areas of 
less developed countries cohen said by 1975 that number had 
swelled to 819 million and the projection for the year 2000 is 21 
billion 
megacities such as mexico city now hold 25 million people 
and sao paolo brazil has attracted 20 million said cohen a vast 
number of these migrants have been forced to take up residence as 
squatters at city fringes living in unsafe homemade structures 
illegally built on someone elses land he said 
in latin america its frequently shacks in africa its 
frequently mud huts said cohen in the 1980s probably half 
the population in most major third world cities lived in squatter 
areas or slums which usually lack electricity toilet facilities 
and water 
the world bank which draws its funds from national government 
and world capital markets lent 60 developing countries 101 
billion for housing and urban development projects between 1972 and 
june 1990 cohen said 
but the bank increasingly is funneling money through governments 
to private enterprise he said 
in the soviet union where people pay nominal rent to live in 
cramped quarters in monotonous governmentowned apartment 
buildings attempts are being made to improve quality of life and 
create more individual investment says alexander krivov who 
coordinated a soviet case study 
new programs aim to nearly double home building by encouraging 
more private construction and ownership concentrating efforts on 
singlefamily homes in the suburbs said krivov who is vice 
chairman of the state committee on architecture and urban planning 
in moscow 
singlefamily houses with pieces of land around it its 
another pattern of life another quality of life he said 
in the united states where nearly all housing is built by 
private developers the gap between the haves and the havenots 
is increasing said john tuccillo coordinator of the us case 
study and senior vice president and chief economist for the 
realtors association 
tuccillo said building regulations designed to protect the 
publics welfare have become a burden instead increasing 
developers costs limiting flexibility and wasting time 
its a case for easing those standards a bit to allow the 
production of housing thats within the reach of folks who have a 
hard time acquiring housing he said 
other countries presenting case studies at the conference 
include zimbabwe india indonesia thailand china trinidad and 
tobago chile bolivia colombia portugal and west germany 
the meeting is the third publicprivate convention held to 
discuss housing needs worldwide china the soviet union and 
eastern bloc countries will participate for the first time

it was like a journey back in time when the 
national aids commission traveled to south georgia last week for a 
firsthand look at how rural areas are coping with the deadly 
disease 
im afraid were seeing history repeat itself said dr june 
osborn chairwoman of the panel after the commission spent two 
days in waycross albany and macon visiting with aids patients and 
talking with health care professionals 
the same fear the same isolation for people with aids the 
same difficulty in mobilizing coordinated care that we saw in the 
beginning of the urban epidemic back a few years ago is happening 
all over again she said 
the commissions trip came on the heels of a federal centers for 
disease control report that aids is spreading more rapidly in rural 
areas than in cities from 1988 to 1989 the cdc found that 
nonmetropolitan areas had a 37 percent increase in new aids cases 
while metro areas had only a 5 percent gain 
in georgia the state department of human resources reported in 
january that the number of aids cases had tripled in two years 
with the rapid spread of the disease in rural parts of the state 
linked to drug users and heterosexual transmission 
rep roy rowland dga a member of the commission agreed with 
osborns assessment that history may be repeating itself but 
rowland a physician who practiced in rural dublin ga for 28 
years before being elected to congress said he does not think 
rural areas will have as much difficulty overcoming those problems 
of fear and discrimination as urban areas have had 
theres a lot more acceptance of the fact that this is a 
disease that we need to be fighting and not fighting the people who 
have the disease rowland said i dont think the battle is 
going to be as tough in rural areas because of that 
still osborn said she was shocked at the extent to which health 
care professionals in rural georgia were avoiding aids cases 
some of the public fear is bouncing off the fear of health 
professionals she said it was striking to us that while there 
were some very committed people doing wonderful work there was 
also an undercurrent of health professionals not really wanting to 
touch these people 
in south georgia as in most rural areas commission members said 
they found a health care system even less prepared to deal with an 
onslaught of aids cases than the already overburdened health care 
systems in cities like new york and san francisco 
the rural health care system is much more fragile than the 
urban just on a matter of scale and the fact that many of these 
rural areas already have severe doctor shortages osborn said 
since even a small number of aids cases could overburden a 
struggling rural hospital osborn said it is critical that people 
infected with the hiv virus in rural areas be treated in the early 
stages of the disease and continuously thereafter 
in the big cities where aids is already hitting as hard as it 
is its going to be very hard to play catchup because youve 
already got hospitals teetering she said 
but in rural areas if one were paying good attention and 
shoring up some of the existing primary health care and public 
health capabilities its possible you could get out in front 
before the number of cases gets overwhelming she said 
both osborn and rowland said they expect the commission to take 
an active role in urging congress to provide new funding to attack 
the aids problem in rural areas 
the senate labor and human resources committee earlier this 
month unanimously approved a bill that would provide 600 million 
in emergency funds to help alleviate the aids care crisis 
half of the 600 million would be directed to cities with more 
than 2000 aids cases but the other half would go to states to 
permit them to develop comprehensive hiv care programs in small 
cities and rural areas 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections 
the disease is spread most often through sexual contact needles 
or syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood 
products and from infected pregnant women to their offspring

a month after announcing her senate candidacy 
new jersey republican christine todd whitman had raised 70000 or 
roughly 2300 a day not bad for a littleknown challenger 
but whitmans opponent democratic sen bill bradley has been 
raising 5000 a day for more than five years thats more than 9 
million 
whitmans situation although extreme is far from unique the 
lifeblood of politics is money and for challengers cash often is 
hard to come by 
the problem is greatest for challengers like whitman who never 
have held major elected office but the pinch also is being felt by 
four gop house members challenging democratic senators this year 
all four trail in the fundraising race according to the latest 
campaign finance reports 
critics of the campaign finance system see the fundraising 
imbalance as the main reason so few incumbents are defeated 983 
percent of house incumbents were reelected in 1988 
fred wertheimer president of the citizens lobby common cause 
said the current campaign finance situation is a system where 
incumbents are drowning in special interest money while challengers 
are starving for resources it also leads to a challengerproof 
congress 
cashpoor challengers with personal wealth frequently resort to 
lending themselves money and often end their campaigns with 
considerable debts fec data show senate challengers relied on 
personal loans for 10 percent of their campaign money in 1988 
elections house challengers for 19 percent 
in massachusetts democratic sen john kerry raised nearly 
760000 in the first three months of 1990 more than double the 
470000 raised by two republicans vying for the chance to 
challenge him in november the gop totals include a combined 
320000 the challengers lent their campaigns during the first 
quarter according to federal election commission reports 
house races typically cost less than senate campaigns so the 
fundraising gap between incumbents and challengers generally is 
smaller but there are gaps nonetheless 
in pennsylvania democratic rep peter kostmayer collected 
82000 in donations during the first three months of 1990 
according to his quarterly fec report his republican opponent 
political newcomer audrey zettick schaller raised 13500 
kostmayer who spent 1 million to win reelection two years ago 
and has endorsed legislation to limit campaign spending has 
refused her request that he agree to a 400000 spending limit 
no matter what limits we could come to he has the advantages 
of incumbency schaller said i dont see what his problem is 
except that hes not good for his word 
a big factor in the lopsided fundraising situation is political 
action committees associated with special interest groups which 
offer a seemingly endless source of contributions for incumbents 
fec data show that at this point in 1988 senate elections 
political action committees had contributed nearly 15 million to 
incumbents and 23 million to challengers in house races pac 
contributions favored incumbents over challengers 32 million to 
12 million 
the four house members giving up seemingly safe seats to take on 
incumbent senators are getting a taste of the financial challenge 
to challenging this year 
in illinois republican rep lynn martin raised 482000 in the 
first quarter of the year compared with 556000 for democratic 
sen paul simon but simons wellstocked warchest left him with 
15 million on hand compared with 410000 for martin as of march 
31 according to their fec filings 
rep tom tauke riowa raised 586000 from january through 
march and had the best first quarter of the four house members but 
his fundraising still was eclipsed by the 700000 raised by sen 
tom harkin who ended the quarter with 11 million cash on hand 
compared with taukes 293000 
these challengers however are in line for considerable party 
support as the gop seeks to chip away at the democratic senate 
majority 
in the three races for open senate seats it is the incumbent 
house members who have the clear fundraising edge 
in colorado republican rep hank brown raised 377000 for his 
senate campaign and had 11 million on hand at the end of the 
first quarter his likely democratic challenger boulder county 
commissioner jodie heath raised 126000 and ended the quarter 
with 71000 in the bank 
the importance and difficulty of fund raising is not lost on 
heath who offered this simple assessment during a trip to 
washington seeking political action committee support 
youre just sort of shamelessly begging thats what federal 
politics is about

jim florio steamrolled opponent james 
courter in the race for governor last year with a campaign that was 
praised as effective but criticized as nasty 
as he nears his 100th day as new jerseys 49th governor on 
wednesday the florio story line hasnt changed 
supporters praise the democrat for taking hold of state 
government with the bold handson style of a true leader 
opponents rip florio for grasping state government with too 
tight a grip saying his administration is akin to a monarchy that 
does not tolerate debate 
clearly the combative former congressman from camden did not 
opt to ease into the job in his first 100 days 
with a swiftness that matched the pace of his campaign florio 
52 has placed his imprint on virtually every state government 
operation 
jim florio has demonstrated something thats not all that 
common in american politics courage said ross baker political 
scientist at rutgers university but frankly that usually comes 
from people who are not all that likeable hes pushing an already 
powerful office to its limits in a way predecessors tom kean and 
brendan byrne never did 
since january florio has pushed through controversial auto 
insurance reform postponed a toll increase on the new jersey 
turnpike and proposed 14 billion in new taxes including a sales 
tax increase from 6 percent to 7 percent and spending cuts to 
solve a budget crisis 
florio enraged gun activists by proposing to ban assault 
weapons blasted the oil industry for spills in state waterways and 
traded harsh words with industry officials over his auto insurance 
reform 
florio has not been shy about blaming former gov thomas h kean 
for new jerseys budget woes claiming he was forced to break a 
campaign promise against raising major taxes because he never knew 
things were this bad 
if he wants a program florio battles for it taking no 
prisoners in the sometimes dizzying process 
everyone seems to think weve discovered some new approach 
for government by facing up to problems and not doing things that 
are in the short term politically beneficial florio said in an 
interview with the associated press it may be new for people in 
trenton but its been my style for a long time 
when allstate insurance co officials blasted the plan prior to 
its first legislative hearing florio a former boxer came out 
smoking 
they say theyre the good hands people florio said at the 
time the question is what part of our anatomy do they have 
their hands around 
the auto insurance reform moved through the 
democraticcontrolled legislative process within 45 days a 
lightning quick pace by trenton standards the 80page measure 
faces a court challenge because it forces insurers to pay off half 
of the 31 billion debt facing the state pool for highrisk 
drivers which at one point covered more than half of the states 
motorists auto insurance rates in new jersey are among the highest 
in the nation 
his budget proposes to increase the sales tax raise taxes on 
liquor cigarettes and oil products and eliminate a popular 
homeowner rebate program the budget includes deep cuts to many 
programs 
gop leaders oppose the tax increases and claim florios strategy 
is to stockpile state income sources so he can spend more on 
programs in his reelection year 
florio makes no apologies for the swift movement of his 
initiatives 
this reflects the values of the people of the state he 
said they want problems solved not later but sooner they want 
things managed in sensible ways 
im doing what has to be done to ensure well have financial 
stability in the state and to allow the states economy to grow 
he said to not do it will precipitate a financial crisis 
baker said florio will have to be careful about approaching 
every issue in an aggressive manner he said lawmakers are slighted 
by such as manner 
he needs to stroke people baker said legislators are 
very bad at pursuing their own agenda but they can be very good at 
wrecking someone elses 
the governor said he recognizes the risks 
its called accountability florio said i will take the 
responsibility for things that i initiate and support if im going 
to be held accountable thats fine but give me the authority to 
deal with it

night after night of aerial pesticide 
spraying hasnt halted the 50mile spread of the destructive medfly 
from suburban back yards to orange and grapefruit groves in some of 
the regions richest farmland 
new outbreaks this month and the approach of summer weather have 
some scientists and growers in the nations no 1 agricultural 
state fearing the worst costly farm quarantines or even more 
serious foreign embargoes of california produce 
compounding the worries are continual protests against nightly 
helicopter missions that rain on neighborhoods a malathionlaced 
syrup that is a primary weapon in the medfly war new doubts also 
have arisen about government insistence that the eradication 
campaign is working 
the newest focus of concern is 10 fresh outbreaks of the medfly 
plague this month all but two of them outside previously treated 
infestations 
this is nothing short of a major crisis said entomologist 
james r carey a member of the states fruit fly scientific 
advisory panel 
carey and richard rice a colleague at the university of 
california davis believe the medfly has become established 
throughout california and that state policy requires an immediate 
overhaul 
i can think of no other explanation of whats happening 
said carey he believes the sporadic latewinter medfly discoveries 
portend an explosion in medfly populations by midsummer when warm 
weather increases the insects breeding rates 
if your house is on fire and the fire starts in the kitchen 
you dont wait until it gets to the bedroom before you call the 
fire department rice said were in deep trouble right now 
the mediterranean fruit fly is considered one of the most 
serious agricultural pests in the world 
the insect smaller than a house fly lays its eggs in more than 
250 varieties of fruits vegetables and nuts within several days 
the larvae hatch and feed on the fruit turning it into an 
inedible unsaleable mush the 198182 outbreak in the state and 
resulting quarantines cost growers 100 million while another 100 
million was spent on eradication 
in a march 26 memo circulated among top agriculture officials 
carey argues that a new longrange and aggressive strategy must be 
adopted to get rid of the medfly this time around 
i feel that a program designed to eradicate the medfly must be 
viewed as similar to those designed to eradicate major diseases 
such as smallpox or malaria carey wrote 
carey recommends a new research effort to develop better tools 
to detect and exterminate the medfly 
nevertheless officials at the california department of food and 
agriculture maintain that the 365 million medfly eradication 
program is working 
dr carey has not produced any scientific data to prove his 
hypothesis said isi siddiqui an assistant director of the 
department and as a state official who supervises the war against 
the medfly siddiqui said he must have proof before ordering a new 
strategy 
obviously we are experiencing more difficulties than we 
expected siddiqui acknowledged but he said the treatment 
program which mostly uses aerial pesticide spraying and the 
release of millions of sterile medflies will eventually wipe out 
the cropdestroying pest 
gov george deukmejian added his support thursday saying the 
department of agriculture is pursuing what is a timetested method 
of eradicating the medfly 
other scientists on the states fivemember advisory panel also 
have failed to be persuaded by carey and rice said chairman roy 
cunningham 
these finds are of course discouraging but they arent really 
supportive of careys thesis cunningham said 
still cunningham acknowledged that he doesnt entirely 
understand whats happening 
everyone agrees that a fundamental problem in determining the 
extent of the infestation is the uncertainty of methods used to 
detect fruit flies 
a variety of medfly traps some baited with sex lures and others 
with food are set out throughout southern california 
but some studies suggest most medflies ignore the traps and for 
each medfly caught in a trap scientists estimate 500 to 1000 
other medflies are still loose in the vicinity 
if you ask my wish list i think id like to see a more 
effective lure that attracts the flies siddiqui said 
the scientific debate however has left farmers wondering whom 
to believe and fearing what more outbreaks may lead to 
sure you dread it said mike stuart a spokesman for the 
irvinebased western growers association if your orchard or your 
packing house or your farm is unlucky enough to be inside a 
quarantine area on the basis of a fly find its a nightmare 
the new medfly discoveries prompted agriculture officials to 
order aerial spraying in several new areas including 19 square 
miles in the riverside county community of woodcrest about 55 
miles east of los angeles 
agriculture officials also plan to establish a quarantine for 84 
square miles around the pesticide treatment zone including some 
3000 of riverside countys 37000 acres of citrus groves

democratic gov wallace wilkinson is 
playing favorites in his partys us senate primary this year 
training his fire on a onetime ally he claims reneged on a promise 
wilkinson is siding with underdog john brock the elected state 
school superintendent over harvey sloane whose own campaign for 
governor in 1983 wilkinson had championed 
meanwhile the republican incumbent sen mitch mcconnell sits 
comfortably atop a 3 million campaign fund awaiting a democratic 
opponent 
sloane a physician former louisville mayor and jefferson 
county judgeexecutive says he will win the primary despite the 
governors opposition wilkinson who was finance chairman in 
sloanes 1983 campaign claims sloane reneged on a promise to 
support him in 1987 
sloane maintains that wilkinson has put together a network of 
party contacts to work against him polls however show little 
public support being transferred to brock 
i just have not seen a dynamic in his campaign sloane said 
of brock i would imagine hes looking toward the latter part of 
it when the governor can get out for him 
mcconnell who is seeking a second term and faces only token 
opposition in the may 29 primary reserves his attacks for sloane 
i dont see much life out of the brock campaign and i am 
assuming sloane is going to be the opponent he said 
but brock who entered the race in october banking on 
wilkinsons endorsement is equally confident of victory in the 
primary 
im always running scared and working hard but i think 
were going to win in may without any difficulty brock said 
he takes heart from sloanes record as a twotime loser in 
statewide races the 1979 and 1983 gubernatorial primaries 
he got 30 percent of the vote in each of those elections 
which means 70 percent of the people voted for another candidate 
brock said 
sloane has spent two years preparing to run against mcconnell 
as of march 31 he had 670000 in his campaign fund compared to 
brocks 47000 
although he has the support of the states teacher organization 
trial lawyers and organized labor sloane has failed to unite the 
democratic hierarchy behind him 
former gov edward ned breathitt endorsed brock as did dr 
grady stumbo who ran for governor in 1983 and 1987 and enjoyed 
wide support in the rural areas of eastern and western kentucky 
sloanes recent problems include the prospect of employee 
layoffs and the closing of health clinics in jefferson county 
because of a budget crisis left from his term he also has been 
hurt by the disclosure that the state board of medical licensure 
had privately criticized him for prescribing his own sleeping 
pills even though he maintains no active medical practice 
that brock has not tried to exploit those issues puzzles some 
observers including mcconnell 
frankly if brock were better at running for office he could 
win the primary based upon whats out there already mcconnell 
said 
sloanes most conspicuous problem however has been wilkinsons 
enmity the governor has consistently bashed sloane as too liberal 
for kentucky voters a theme echoed by brock 
it is in fact about the only direct criticism the softspoken 
brock is willing to make sloane is a fine man and i like him 
very much but i dont think his philosophy is what most 
kentuckians want in washington brock said 
im running for the united states senate im not running 
against harvey sloane

the census bureau under attack for missing 
millions of people when it mailed out forms to americans is now 
dispatching an army of people to count heads 
an estimated 330000 enumerators will be making the rounds of 
americas houses apartments and condominiums to count those who 
didnt return their census forms 
we will visit each housing unit that did not return a 
questionnaire and we have the workforce to do it said census 
bureau director barbara everitt bryant 
the workforce is larger than anticipated because of a poorer 
than expected return of the mass mailing from the government last 
month training of the workers who will go americas homes and 
apartments begins monday with the actual counting scheduled to 
start thursday 
the cost of the doortodoor canvas is expected to add 150 
million or more to the price of the census originally estimated at 
13 billion for this year 
results of the census will be used to determine congressional 
representation for the next decade and the distribution of federal 
aid for programs ranging from help for the homeless to funds for 
the war on drugs 
problems in the initial mailing have caused a chorus of 
complaints that the census is being mishandled some americans 
simply didnt return their forms others including one entire 
town in california never received them in the first place 
its early in the census process and there is much to be 
done said rep thomas sawyer dohio chairman of the house 
subcommittee supervising the census 
rep mervyn dymally dcalif says the project is on the brink 
of disaster and sen john heinz rpa has called for a senate 
investigation 
the census bureau had hoped that 70 percent of americans would 
send back their forms as of friday the rate was only 63 percent 
forcing the bureau to hire more people to continue the count 
bryant said that the bureau has a pool of 14 million qualified 
job applicants nationwide that provides more than four people for 
each of the 330000 jobs to be filled she said 
unfortunately she said the applicants are not evenly 
distributed there is double the national average available for 
each job in new york for example but a slight shortage of 
available workers on long island 
a study by the general accounting office concluded that nearly 
half the bureaus local offices had fewer than four applicants for 
every job and the gao found that precensus work was slowed by 
staff shortages in 15 of the 109 district offices open in 1989 
in the precanvass work developing address lists for example 
some workers from the philadelphia area were sent to help in 
newark nj the same occurred in the new york city and los angeles 
areas 
to help fill scattered shortages of census workers congress has 
permitted retired federal workers and military personnel to take 
temporary census jobs without losing their retirement benefits 
in addition the department of housing and urban affairs is 
permitting residents of subsidized housing to accept census jobs 
without the extra income causing their rent to go up similar 
rulings now apply to recipients of food stamps and other public 
assistance 
hiring census takers is a particular problem in areas with low 
unemployment where necessary the bureau will hire people from 
neighboring communities to conduct the count but for a variety of 
reasons it prefers relying on local residents 
first they are more comfortable walking the halls of large 
apartment buildings and along ghetto streets in addition they are 
more likely to be familiar with local languages and geography and 
trusted more by local residents wary of outsiders 
using local residents a census takers is considered especially 
important in hispanic areas where people are afraid that giving 
any information to the government will lead to a visit by 
immigration officials 
the census bureau has worked hard to stress the confidentiality 
of the answers people give and many hispanic groups have worked to 
encourage public cooperation

discoverys five astronauts returned 
sunday for a second attempt to launch the shuttle with nasas most 
valuable and celebrated payload the 15 billion hubble space 
telescope 
discovery is scheduled to lift off at 831 am edt tuesday 
we feel very confident that things are going to go well this 
time said discoverys commander air force col loren j shriver 
were going to come out ok on tuesday morning and if not 
well just keep trying until we do thats kind of the name of the 
game here shriver said 
nasa test director mike leinbach said sunday that the countdown 
was proceeding smoothly and the shuttle appeared to be in perfect 
condition the countdown got under way saturday afternoon 
a faulty power unit forced the first launch attempt to be 
scrubbed four minutes before liftoff april 10 the unit was 
replaced with a new one which tests showed to be fine 
hopefully well get the shuttle off the pad this time 
leinbach said 
a 70 percent chance of favorable weather was expected at launch 
time with low clouds being the main concern said the air forces 
ed priselac shuttle weather officer a weak cold front from the 
north was expected to pass through the area by monday night 
the outlook is considerably better for wednesday and thursday 
priselac said 
as discoverys astronauts arrived from johnson space center in 
houston early sunday afternoon the shuttle columbia was being 
transported to a launch pad 16 miles from discovery 
it is only the second time both shuttle launch pads at kennedy 
space center have been occupied simultaneously the first time was 
in january 1986 16 days after columbia lifted off challenger 
exploded 
columbia commander vance brand said he does not believe the 
national aeronautics and space administration is moving too fast 
with his shuttle nasa expects to launch columbia with an 
astronomical observatory called astro no earlier than may 16 one 
week later than planned because of discoverys twoweek delay 
in some cases it could be a problem having shuttles on both 
launch pads brand said in this particular case everythings 
fitting together 
nasa has until saturday to get discovery off the ground after 
that all launch attempts must be halted for eight days so hubbles 
batteries can be recharged 
the six nickelhydrogen batteries will power hubble from the 
time it is disconnected from discoverys electrical system until 
its two energycollecting solar panels take over in space 
discoverys payload bay was sealed late saturday night 
drastically reducing the risk of contamination to the telescopes 
finely polished 945inch mirror 
discovery will aim for an altitude of 380 miles the highest a 
shuttle has ever gone so the telescope can be placed in its proper 
orbit far above earths distorting atmosphere during hubbles 
15year journey through space astronomers expect to look back to 
nearly the beginning of time and solve some of the universes most 
perplexing mysteries 
astro will measure ultraviolet radiation undetected by hubble 
and thus provide additional targets for the telescope the 100 
million observatory also will focus during columbias nineday 
mission on comet austin believed to be on its first trip through 
the solar system 
both hubble and astro were scheduled for launch in 1986 but 
were delayed by the challenger accident

sirens wailed for two minutes throughout israel 
sunday as life briefly came to a standstill in remembrance of the 6 
million jews slain in the nazi holocaust 
as the sirens sounded at 10 am traffic ground to a halt and 
thousands of israelis stood silently at attention to honor the 
victims 
hundreds of israelis also marked holocaust martyrs and heroes 
remembrance day by participating in ceremonies across the country 
at which the names of victims were read by relatives and friends 
according to recent statistics there are 302404 holocaust 
survivors living in this nation of 47 million people including 
polishborn prime minister yitzhak shamir and other top military 
and political leaders 
i remember my family members who have died in those terrible 
and fearsome days said shamir 74 who lost his parents two 
sisters their husbands and children during world war ii 
my father shlomo ben yitzhak ysernitsky who was killed by 
polish farmers his friends from childhood when he came to them 
seeking refuge after escaping from a death train he said

when 52 american hostages were released by 
iran in 1981 a team of 30 doctors psychiatrists psychologists 
and social workers awaited them in germany to cushion the shock of 
their newly regained freedom 
something similar awaits robert polhill a 55yearold american 
educator who was released sunday by kidnappers in lebanon after 39 
months in captivity this time the assemblage of experts was given 
a name the hostage reception team 
we have procedures in place that ensure that appropriate 
action is taken in the event that a release takes place state 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said last week but she 
said detailed discussion of these procedures could complicate an 
already complex and sensitive situation 
the 1981 experience however gives a clue to how the hostage 
reception team works 
the experts were gathered at the us air force hospital in 
wiesbaden west germany members were selected for their experience 
in treating prisoners of war and civilian hostages and a special 
interest in the psychological problems of hostages 
the team members had studied the medical and psychiatric history 
of the hostages before their capture read copies of letters about 
medical matters the hostages had sent form iran and interviewed 
their relatives and physicians 
there was a special circumstance that dictated reading of the 
letters and the interviews the records of those hostages who were 
members of the armed forces were lost when the iranian embassy was 
captured 
with a far greater number of hostages to concern them social 
workers had visited family members to evaluate the psychological 
support the men could expect on their return home others spoke 
with the families by telephone or exchanged letters 
while there is an extensive debriefing process for a hostage 
when he or she is able there is also a briefing process to bring 
the hostage up to date 
experts say when people are taken hostage they are thrust into 
a dependent infantile state they must ask permission to move about 
and take care of physical necessities many hostages respond to 
these indignities by developing trust even gratitude to their 
kidnappers for sparing their lives 
that apparently wasnt the case in 1981 when the hostages had 
been held for 444 days according to doctors the americans were 
treated so badly that they showed no signs of the stockholm 
syndrome which is a gradual bonding of captors and captives the 
name comes from hostages held by trapped robbers in a swedish bank 
many years ago 
one reason hostages are held in wiesbaden for treatment is to 
give them a chance to release tensions and to receive advice on how 
they might deal with potential emotional problems 
one doctor on the 1981 team told reporters our job is being 
available to assist the hostages not to tell them what they should 
be thinking

most western hostages in lebanon are 
believed held by factions of hezbollah or party of god a 
fundamentalist shiite moslem group that gets considerable financial 
support from iran 
hezbollah works closely with units of iranian revolutionary 
guards stationed in lebanon since israels 1982 invasion to build 
influence among the 12 million shiites lebanons largest sect 
the factions are believed to be closely linked and may even be 
largely the same people using different cover names

bombing the us and french embassies in december 1983 some of 
whom are believed to be relatives of islamic jihad members two of 
the 17 were released after serving fiveyear prison terms

it was a militant show of solidarity unique 
in this conservative state thousands of signtoting school 
teachers marching on the state capitol in what could be a sign of 
the times for the nation 
they came by the busload from tulsa from henryetta from 
hooker from caney valley and dozens of points in between with a 
single message to legislators pass house bill 1017 
the protest worked late thursday the oklahoma senate approved 
the bill a 230 million education and tax package ending a 
legislative battle that began eight months ago when gov henry 
bellmon called a special session 
officials say it was a unique coalition of labor and business 
that in the end got the bill approved and may have helped establish 
a national trend 
called by the 31000member oklahoma education association the 
walkout produced demonstrations at the capitol by more than 10000 
teachers each day 
bellmon said he would sign the education bill this week making 
oklahoma a leader in education reform one senator said the bill 
will make sure the state is not be a third world state in 
teacher pay 
oklahoma teachers with an average pay of 22000 a year rank 
48th the national average is 29648 
the strike closed hundreds of schools affecting more than 
300000 of the states 572000 students but it did not produce the 
citizen backlash many expected including bellmon the governor 
who initially asked the attorney general for a way to prevent the 
walkout said teachers had a very constructive impact 
keith geiger president of the national education association 
joined the picket line thursday he said oklahoma is the fourth 
state this school year where teachers have held walkouts the 
others were west virginia utah and washington 
i think this means frustration is built up so much that the 
lid is popping off all over geiger said i dont think we have 
seen the end of this i would not be surprised to see more 
strikes 
while the teachers demonstrated outside business farm and 
civic groups walked the halls inside the capitol seeking the final 
votes needed to attach the emergency clause to the bill 
the emergency clause which would make the bill effective 
immediately upon the governors signature had been the stumbling 
block to the stalemate 
dick rush president of the oklahoma state chamber of commerce 
said it was the first major bill of any depth to answer 
president bushs call at his national education summit last year 
rush said he expects similar coalitions to develop in other 
states as leaders realize the necessity to improve educational 
systems to compete in a global society that puts a premium on 
technology 
many school administrators backed the teachers efforts and some 
even joined the picket lines 
what youre seeing here is five years of builtup feelings 
said weldon davis a former oea president who is now an assistant 
principal in the oklahoma city school system 
davis said it had been five years since oklahoma teachers had 
received significant money for pay raises from the legislature the 
state is still recovering from an economic decline that began in 
the early 1980s with the collapse of the oil boom 
bellmon a republican criticized members of his own party for 
taking a traditional antitax stand and voting against the bill in 
the senate calling it a terrible political blunder 
he said he hopes a citizens group does not go ahead with its 
threat to launch an initiative drive to overturn the plan because 
of objections to the tax provisions 
the bill passed as an emergency measure 3214 after five 
democratic senators changed their votes twelve of the 13 
republicans present voted against the bill 
the education package calls for raising 230 million by 
increasing sales and income taxes a onehalf cent increase in the 
4cent state sales tax increase would raise 104 million as would a 
10 percent increase in personal income taxes an increase in the 
corporate tax from 5 percent to 6 percent would produce 22 million 
it increases funds for teachers salaries special education 
programs for disadvantaged students and technological innovations

pope john paul ii announced 
plans sunday for an unprecedented europeanwide meeting of bishops 
to discuss spreading the churchs message across the continent 
after the fall of communist regimes 
a spokesman also disclosed that the roman catholic leader would 
visit cuba in december 
at an outdoor mass later in bratislava which drew several 
hundred thousand faithful on a raindrenched field the pope lauded 
the perseverance of roman catholics and gave special thanks to 
czechoslovakias youth who sparked the peaceful november 
revolution 
i am thinking of the young people whom others tried to lead 
astray but who did not lose their thirst for truth justice and 
love and who in the light of such values became the agents of 
recent changes he said 
the 69yearold pontiff ending a twoday tour of 
czechoslovakia left for rome later sunday from bratislava 35 
miles northeast of vienna 
he was seen off by prime minister marian calfa who said the 
visit had strenghtened the feeling of togetherness in all of us 
the pope made his announcement of a synod as he visited a 
moravian shrine in the city of velehrad 90 miles from bratislava 
the shrine was dedicated to cyril and methodius two patron saints 
of europe 
we could find no better occasion for an announcement that 
intimately concerns this continent which throughout the centuries 
has been torn by wars but also blessed with a presence and work of 
countless saints who sowed the gospel seeds far and wide he said 
john paul said the synod a deliberative body will be held at 
a nottoodistant date 
papal spokesmen joaquin navarro said he did not expect it would 
be held this year but said details will be announced in rome on 
tuesday 
to my mind the agenda for the synod will be huge it will be 
the first such european church summit bringing together bishops 
from every country on the continent navarro said 
europe has about 1000 of the worlds 3000 bishops the synod 
apparently will map strategy to meet the popes vision of a europe 
united on the basis of its christian roots rejecting the 
materialist communist concepts that prevailed in the east as well 
as the consumeristicminded western model 
navarro also said the pope had accepted a invitation to visit 
the caribbean island country ruled by fidel castros hardline 
communist government 
the spokesman said the pope is going before christmas but the 
exact date in december is not set 
since european communist regimes started crumbling last year 
the vatican has been moving quickly to expand its influence in the 
region 
the popes native poland was the first to restore diplomatic 
relations with the holy see that countrys first postwar 
noncommunist premier tadeusz mazowiecki attended the papal mass 
in velehrad and kissed the pontiffs ring 
mazowiecki is a catholic intellectual and was a longtime adviser 
to solidarity the movement inspired in part by the pope that 
launched the wave of change in the east 
after celebrating a mass at velehrad attended by some 200000 
people the pope flew on to bratislava capital of slovakia for 
another huge openair service that was the final big event of his 
trip 
attending the outdoor mass in bratislava was deputy prime 
minister jan carnogursky a slovak and emerging leader of the 
increasingly ambitious christian democratic movement which is 
expected to do well in upcoming parliamentary elections june 89 
the movement was expected to reap political benefits from the 
popes visit and carnogursky even performed a reading during the 
mass 
also prominent at the service was parliament speaker alexander 
dubcek the former communist party leader whose 1968 prague 
spring reforms prompted the warsaw pact invasion of 
czechoslovakia and restoration of hardline policies 
statistics released by the vatican estimate 107 million 
catholics live in the country of 156 million 
the trip was the popes 46th foreign tour next month he is to 
visit mexico and malta and he plans a tour of africa in september 
in addition to the cuban stop in december

in the dim light of a supersecure 
command bunker army lt col john w wilson paced chin on chest 
listening to an intelligence report on a soviet submarine off the 
california coast 
an instant later as he glanced up at an illuminated global 
chessboard of us and sviet military forces wilson stopped 
short a voice near him cried bsts alert an earlywarning 
satellite was signaling the launch of a nuclear missile 
wilson had the comfort of knowing this was only a war game 
simulation but voices in the control center carried a serious tone 
from the moment a us surveillance plane over the pacific reported 
spotting a missile booster surging toward the surface 
for wilson it was time to start thinking about doomsday and how 
to escape 
he sent word to the white house we have a detected launch off 
the west coast 
then nearly as abruptly as the attack had begun it was 
over minutes after the count of incoming soviet missiles reached 
15 and before the warheads could hit their targets in the 
southwestern united states all were destroyed in a space and 
landbased rocket barrage orchestrated from wilsons bunker 
the crisis was a computersimulated nuclear attack it was 
not the allout assault that america has spent trillions of dollars 
trying to deter throughout the cold war but a smallscale launch 
by a rogue soviet submarine commander 
the scenario played out for reporters recently at the armys 
strategic defense command dramatizes the new rationale being 
promoted by the bush administration for investing billions in a 
star wars missile defense at a time when even the pentagon 
acknowledges that the threat of world war iii is the lowest in 40 
years 
instead of the impregnable worldwide shield against a massive 
wave of soviet missiles as originally envisioned by ronald reagan 
seven years ago promoters of the strategic defense initiative say 
a more modest defense is needed one that still would put weapons 
in space at a cost of about 55 billion but would be capable of 
knocking out only half of the soviets main intercontinental 
ballistic missile force 
the new rationale also stresses a need to protect against an 
accidental or unauthorized soviet launch or a limited missile 
attack by a third world country 
gone is reagans talk of making nuclear weapons impotent and 
obsolete the aim now is to improve the traditional role of 
offensive nuclear forces as a deterrent to war by making the odds 
of a successful first strike even more uncertain 
gone at least for the remainder of this century are ideas of 
using exotic and futuristic weaponry such as the xray laser and 
particle beam weapon that originally gave sdi the star wars 
nickname the new emphasis is on more downtoearth rapidly 
maturing technology such as kineticenergy warheads that kill 
their targets in space by ramming them at high speed 
gone too is much of the interest in congress for financing the 
project last year for the first time the sdi budget was lower 
than in the year before today its an easy target of politicians 
looking to harvest a postcold war peace dividend 
sdi is public enemy no 1 on capitol hill sen john warner 
rva said recently 
says rep charles bennett dfla who supports a scaleddown 
sdi research budget but not deployment congress hasnt voted to 
produce it and probably never will 
bush has told the pentagon he wants to be able to decide by 1992 
whether to deploy a star wars defense but he probably wont get 
the chance by then officials and scientists working on the project 
say theyll need a healthy increase in funds well above what 
congress seems likely to grant next year and in 1992 to lay a 
sound technical foundation on which bush could base his decision 
lt gen robert d hammond commander of the strategic defense 
command that handles about onethird of the star wars research 
told reporters recently that he believed bush could meet his target 
date for a deployment decision only if you have good growth in 
financing beyond the 38 billion authorized for this year 
bush has requested a 1 billion increase for next year but it 
appears unlikely hell get anything close to that he and the 
pentagon may have to live with less 
from the start more than seven years and 19 billion ago the 
project was designed as a longterm effort with little prospect 
for payoff before the turn of the century but political pressure 
to show results grew as policymakers wondered can it work is it 
affordable will the soviets find a way around it 
all three are still open questions 
the main pieces of a star wars system as currently envisioned 
are sensors to detect and track enemy missiles from their launch 
silos land and spacebased rockets to attack the missiles in 
flight and computers to manage the battle 
of those three elements the computer technology is perhaps the 
most problematic 
at the strategic defense command in hunstville where wilson and 
his team of specialists test their responses to simulated nuclear 
attacks engineers are still experimenting with computer programs 
that would be used to orchestrate a star wars response to a real 
attack 
lawrence tubbs acting chief of battle management at the 
strategic defense command said the key questions about the 
computer software are can it be adequately tested and would it 
work 
some scientists say the answer to both is no 
the problem of developing trustworthy software for the sdi is 
not a problem that will be solved in our lifetimes or those of our 
children the computer professionals for social responsibility 
wrote in an open letter to congress on feb 16 
the scientists group urged the abandonment of sdi arguing that 
a single error in the systems software could cause a complete 
system failure under unpredictable circumstances 
it appears unlikely star wars will be killed any time soon if 
only because of its economic lure about 28000 people are working 
on the project at defense contractors national laboratories 
universities and military installations in every state in the 
nation and in five foreign countries 
two aerospace companies boeing co and lockheed corp together 
have taken in 22 billion in star wars contracts over the life of 
the program according to pentagon figures that is more than 10 
percent of all star wars spending altogether more than 1000 
military contractors have a piece of star wars action 
the projects supporters say the american public will support 
more research if they get the message that the goal of ballistic 
missile defense is attainable 
lt gen george monahan director of the sdi project 
acknowledged in testimony to a house panel april 4 that much more 
work was needed to put the star war pieces together but he said 
many scientific question marks have been erased 
there is no doubt in my mind that the technology is here 
sufficient to develop and deploy such a system he said

they came from all over to try the scream 
machine the z force and the georgia cyclone the mind bender got 
a pass because as roller coasters go its no big thing 
the cyclone was getting most of the attention from about 450 
members of the american coaster enthusiasts at their annual outing 
wood is a living organic thing here standing in the middle 
of this one its like being in the heart of a great beast said 
randy geisler of st paul minn president of the 3500member 
organization 
the enthusiasts were out in the fog saturday night testing the 
cyclone a newstyle oldfashioned wooden roller coaster at six 
flags over georgia 
its absolutely dynamite said david schini of naples fla 
who with his wife elizabeth had driven 11 hours to ride this 
thing 
this one it takes all the oldfashioned thrills and adds the 
modern technology schini said 
the georgia cyclone combines the speed of a big wooden roller 
coaster with the twisting banked turns of a steel coaster 
to me one of the most important things is the visual effect 
of it white scaffolding deep dips the coaster will lift you off 
your seat coaster riders call it air time said glenn allen 
of ocala fla 
the 1 minute 48 second ride reaches a top speed of 50 mph 
its one of the great things about wooden roller coasters 
about all the members like the wooden roller coasters better

with it said scott stelfox assistant manager of the chains 
edmond store 
the lobster estimated to be 100 years old was finally placed 
in the stores lobster tank we didnt have much choice even 
though the tank wasnt designed to hold even one 19pound lobster 
stelfox said 
most of the lobsters sold to shoppers are about 1 pounds 
firefighter cody barger heard about the lobster from his wife 
who saw it in the tank while shopping 
barger a diver with an interest in marine animals began 
looking for a home for lobster neither the oklahoma city zoo nor

they just opened a lobster display and they only have a 
7pound lobster in it barger said 
the lobster was shipped to its new home friday

east germans gathered near the broken berlin 
wall sunday to call attention to one of the worlds most polluted 
nations and to exult in their new freedom to do something about it 
green tents and fluttering banners marking earth day covered 
three blocks of a promenade leading to the historic brandenburg 
gate and a crumbled section of wall that splits the former main 
square of old berlin 
thousands strolled past environmental exhibits painted pictures 
of trees on a huge canvas and quietly debated whether unification 
with west germany would help or hurt the effort to clean up the 
countrys fouled air and tainted water 
it was a far cry from the days when environmentalists held 
secret meetings in church basements poring over books and 
magazines banned by communist authorities 
they were the days when the secret police would restrict our 
ability to travel hold up our mail anything to create 
psychological fear said falk zimmerman director of east 
germanys ark environmental movement 
today the movement is a ubiquitous presence in east germany 
home to the green party the green league and the green ecological 
network among others 
east germany is a huge producer user and exporter of lignite 
or brown coal the deep excavation of it has fouled huge supplies 
of groundwater and the use of it as an energy source by outmoded 
factories has polluted the air said green ecological network water 
specialist michael bender 
you ask me what the worst problem here is and that would be 
brown coal he said but really i do not know where to begin 
a greensled alliance won eight seats in the 400member 
parliament that was chosen by voters in the nations first free 
elections on march 18 which followed the ouster of the hardline 
communist regime in october 
environmentalists here hope the infusion of western industrial 
technology will improve an environment spoiled by archaic east bloc 
manufacturing processes 
but some fear the rush to lure investment and the anxiousness of 
east germans for good jobs will push environmental concerns aside 
i think the environment is in for worse trouble here said 
west berliner raymond lenz 34 as his 5yearold daughter annika 
painted a picture of a tree on a huge maze of canvas cloth i 
think the people here want jobs more anything else

so many american hostages have 
passed through the us air force hospital here after their release 
that it has been dubbed freedom hall 
the hospital in wiesbaden has been used since 1981 when 52 
american hostages were debriefed there after they were freed from 
444 days of captivity in iran 
it has been used because of its proximity to the rheinmain air 
base about about 20 miles to the east where aircraft returning 
from the middle east have landed 
hostages are give full medical dental and mental health 
examinations and are asked to recount their experiences by a 
special team from the us state department which has been in 
wiesbaden since the middle of last week 
most of the hostages have talked to the news media during their 
stay at the hospital occasionally relatives have joined them there 
mental health workers from a military medical team are usually 
the first group to greet the returning captives 
the hospital also was used for the 39 americans held on a 
hijacked twa jetliner in lebanon in june 1985 
some of the former hostages from iran donated a plaque that now 
hangs in a section of the hospital known as freedom hall the 
us military newspaper stars and stripes reported recently 
the last hostage to pass through the debriefing and examination 
process was mithileshwar singh an indian citizen and us 
resident who was freed in 1988 from captivity in beirut

the solidarity trade union on sunday urged 
the government to step up the pace of reform and called for new 
elections to remove communist holdovers from office 
a tersely worded resolution approved in a 29818 vote by 
delegates to solidaritys second national congress demanded that 
new elections be held by spring 1991 
the resolution said that the present composition of the 
parliament elected in june 1989 does not reflect the real 
arrangement of forces in the country 
it also called for direct elections of the president the 
incumbent president gen wojciech jaruzelski was elected by 
parliament last year 
parliamentary elections are not formally scheduled until 1993 
and jaruzelskis sixyear term runs until 1995 elections could be 
held earlier under an overhaul of the constitution now under way 
in an implicit criticism of the government of primer minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki a former solidarity adviser the resolution 
said economic and political reforms must be carried out more 
quickly 
as poland transforms from a centrally planned socialist economy 
to a marketoriented capitalist system the government has 
introduced a shock therapy economic austerity program that has 
reduced inflation but so far has put 200000 people out of work 
solidarity chairman lech walesa has said the mazowiecki 
government has not moved quickly enough to remove communists from 
government ministries and key economic management posts 
the resolution was approved on the fourth day of the unions 
congress as delegates continued to debate solidaritys role in 
postcommunist poland 
it reflects the belief among many solidarity activists that 
poland is now lagging behind other eastern european countries in 
introducing reforms aimed at removing the last vestiges of 
communist rule 
hungary and east germany have already held free multiparty 
elections in which the communists were overwhelmingly defeated 
multiparty voting is scheduled for later this spring in 
czechoslovakia romania and bulgaria 
polands partially free parliamentary elections last june were 
part of a historic and at the time unprecedented powersharing 
compromise with communist authorities 
in the elections the solidarityled opposition was allowed to 
compete for 35 percent of the seats in the lower house of 
parliament and all the seats in the newly created senate 
solidarity won all but one of the seats it could compete for and 
went on to form a new alliance with two smaller formerly 
procommunist parties to take control of the government 
parliament chose mazowiecki to head the government as prime 
ministe but chose jaruzelski for the presidency jaruzelski the 
former communist party leader led the december 1981 martial law 
crackdown that suppressed solidarity the union regained its legal 
status in april 1989 
walesa said earlier this month that he would run for president 
but later backed away from declaring his candidacy 
the 47yearold former electrician and nobel peace prize 
laureate was overwhelmingly reelected saturday as chairman of the 
union he has led since its birth during a nationwide strike wave in 
1980 
a key issue facing solidarity is whether it should continue to 
play a major role in national politics or place more emphasis on 
traditional trade union concerns defending workers interests 
walesa has advocated a mixed approach and delegates appear to 
be going along with him by forging a compromise that would allow 
the union to remain active in politics without neglecting workers 
issues

president bush expressed support for a 
tankerfree zone off the florida coast sunday and told activists 
they wont be too disappointed with his upcoming decision on 
oil drilling off the florida keys 
bush said he would push for a ruling by the international 
maritime organization in london that the waters within 10 miles of 
the florida keys are a protected zone to be avoided by big ships 
the president made the earth day announcement in islamorada a 
resort community on upper matecumbe key before taking off for 
another day of fishing this time with sportscaster curt gowdy 
the veteran broadcaster was filming the presidential fishing 
trip for the american sportsman 
the area bush wants protected from shipping stretches about 200 
miles from key biscayne near miami to the dry tortugas about 70 
miles west of key west the designation of that area as an 
avoidance zone would apply to vessels larger than 150 feet in 
length 
although international shipping interests are not legally bound 
to honor such designations most respect them and keep their 
distance in this case the avoidance zone would mostly affect 
westbound ships many of them tankers that until now have hugged 
the keys reef in order to avoid eastbound gulf stream currents in 
the florida straits 
after three wayward cargo vessels ran aground on the fragile 
reef within a short period last fall floridas governor asked the 
us coast guard to propose the zone the proposal will be 
considered in london in september 
bush also took time on earth day to give his 123rd point of 
light award to founders of key westbased reef relief a group 
that works to protect the only living coral reef in continental 
us waters 
during the public presentation bush hinted to reef relief 
founder craig quirolo that he might support a ban sought by the 
group and others on oil drilling off the florida keys 
the exxon valdez disaster has made us all painfully aware of 
the ecological devastation which can result from a major oil 
spill the president said

nelson mandela called sunday for an 
intensified armed struggle against the white minority government as 
a means of speeding up negotiations on the end of apartheid 
there can be no talk of a lasting peace while government 
agents continue to massacre people mandela said referring to 
three recent incidents of police firing on black demonstrators or 
hitting bystanders while shooting at rioters 
but mandela told a crowd estimated at 70000 in the capital of 
transkei the homeland where he was born that only successful 
negotiations can convince us to end the armed struggle and peace 
will come as a result of negotiations it is not negotiations which 
will come as a result of peace 
president fw de klerk whose cabinet will hold talks with a 
mandelaled african national congress delegation next month has 
said the ancs continued calls for armed struggle are an obstacle 
to formal negotiations on a new constitution which would give the 
black majority the vote 
de klerk said in an interview broadcast on british television 
sunday that he was strongly opposed to war talk even if its 
just rhetoric i regard that as a stumbling block in the way of 
negotiations which must be removed before real negotiations can 
take place 
mandela the ancs deputy president said he has spoken to de 
klerk on the telephone about continuing use of violence against 
black demonstrators and would contact him before the may 24 talks 
to make sure they stayed on track 
the anc postponed the talks which were to have occurred this 
week in protest against the police shooting at sebokeng on march 
26 in which at least 11 black marchers were killed de klerk 
ordered a judicial inquiry into that case 
mandela said the clashes with police showed the ancs guerrilla 
wing which he helped found was still needed the ancs urban 
bombing campaign ended in august but grenade and bomb attacks on 
police and black officials have continued mostly in rural areas 
the armed struggle must be intensified but in a disciplined 
way to ensure that the government does not backtrack from the path 
of negotiation mandela told the rally in umtata capital of the 
xhosa homeland 
mandela said the anc would not discard any of its strategies and 
he hoped to discuss the need for maintaining economic sanctions in 
a meeting in july with british prime minister margaret thatcher in 
london mrs thatcher has opposed most sanctions against south 
africa arguing they would hurt the countrys black majority more 
than the white minority 
the observer newspaper in london quoted mandela as saying he 
hoped to meet mrs thatcher on his way home from a visit to the 
united states where he would hold talks with president bush 
mandela was visiting his tribal homeland for the first time 
since 1956 the south african broadcasting corp said he was 
arrested in 1962 and was freed feb 11 after serving 27 years in 
prison 
while in transkei mandela intends to visit his home village 
qunu and pay respects at the graves of seven relatives who died 
during his imprisonment 
south africa declared transkei an independent republic in 1976 
under the rule of mandelas cousins kaiser and george matanzima 
but no other country recognizes it a series of coups in 1987 led 
to the matanzimas ouster by maj gen bantu holomisa who has 
promised a referendum on reincorporating transkei into south 
africa

china on sunday honored the 120th anniversary of 
lenins birth and joined soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in 
criticizing those who believe the russian revolutionarys theories 
have become outdated 
most unforgettable is his outstanding courage extraordinary 
talent and immortal achievements with which he creatively 
developed marxism chinas peoples daily said in a frontpage 
editorial 
the communist party newspaper said the founder of bolshevism 
will always stay with the peoples of the soviet union china and 
the world 
to belittle lenin belittle leninism and advocate the theory 
that leninism is out of date is the prominent expression of the 
ideological trend of bourgeois liberalization it said 
bourgeois liberalism is the partys label for liberal 
western ideas which are now banned in china 
since crushing a studentled reform movement last year china 
has taken a hardline communist approach even as prodemocracy 
movements in eastern europe drove orthodox communist governments 
from power and gorbachev proceeded with his program of 
marketoriented economic reforms 
on friday night gorbachev complained of slander against 
lenin in a speech to a holiday gala at the bolshoi theater in 
moscow 
disrespect for lenin is unacceptable he told the gathering 
gorbachevs remarks and a series of impassioned defenses of 
lenin in the soviet press last week appeared aimed largely at 
lawmaker yuri afanasyev and his backers afanasyev speaking to the 
soviet congress on march 12 blamed lenin for founding a policy of 
state terror violence and lawlessness 
vladimir i lenin died in 1924 only seven years after he led 
the bolsheviks to power wiped out all opposition and began 
nationalizing the russian economy he emphasized absolute party 
power and rigid discipline within the party key themes of chinas 
current leaders 
he especially stressed that party leadership must be 
maintained in the revolution and construction and pointed out that 
all political and economic work should be led by the vanguard 
with working class consciousness the communist party the 
peoples daily editorial said 
china has raised ideological purity and political loyalty to a 
point not seen since the 196676 cultural revolution 
the peoples daily also reported the publication of a lengthy 
new guide to mao tsetungs thought the writings of communist 
chinas founder largely ignored during the 1980s as the nation 
concentrated on rapid economic development have made a comeback in 
the past year 
china also marked lenins anniversary by coming out with 43 
volumes of a 60volume collected works of lenin 
the official xinhua news agency said the published works include 
10000 writings letters and notes 6000 more than in the 
chineselanguage edition printed in 1959 the rest of the 
collection will be published later this year 
a stamp exhibition honoring lenin opened saturday with a 
display of 300 sheets of soviet stamps provided by the soviet 
philatelic union and 168 sheets of chinese stamps

television interview with released american hostage robert polhill 
sunday night 
</TEXT>

q how do you feel after being released 
a im very happy and grateful to all the people who spent time 
on my case im still deeply concerned about my two friends and 
others who are still held in the conditions i was held in 
some of them have been held longer than me my happiness tonight 
is a bit toned down that theyre not with me im looking forward 
that well be together again all of us 
i dont know where im going i think its better you ask me 
specific questions im not sure i cant summarize 39 months of my 
life its a little bit difficult at this moment i didnt have 
time to begin relecting yet on those 39 months of my life 
q how was your first day in captivity 
a i remember my first day in captivity more than the rest of my 
days in captivity it was boring we were kept away to ensure 
the security of our being kept 
that prevented us from doing anything we were not allowed to 
speak loudly we had something to read but we were deprived 
materials that gave any news about us 
as to our specific conditions i can tell you it could have been 
a lot worse we were not maltreated thanks to those who guarded 
us who tried to give us things within the limits of the 
restrictions on them we played cards 
we were very much in the dark about our status we didnt know 
where we stood that was the worst we didnt know whether we were 
going to be released and when or whether we were ever going to be 
released 
in fact i know that those left behind and others still in 
captivity in places im not aware of quite possibly dont know 
that ive been released but i guess theyll have hope if they know 
ive been released 
q what does freedom mean to you 
a freedom is something that believe it or not neither me nor 
my two associates spent a lot of time thinking about its a bit 
like you wish you had a tbone steak in front of you 
knowing you were not going to get it right away makes you more 
hungry makes you want that steak more so we didnt spend time 
thinking or talking about when wed be freed 
our most difficult assignment was to find things to think about 
to keep our minds active so we didnt begin to vegetate i dont 
know what psychologists say about this my belief is that part of 
the symptom of a mind beginning to stray and go bad to the point of 
danger is the loss of anger 
i was angry at what was done to me at being taken away from my 
wife and family my friends and students and so i strived to 
continue to be angry knowing at all times that if i began to lose 
that anger i would just sort of become a vegetable and i didnt 
want that to happen 
q what do you want to say to the world 
a one thing i probably should say is that i was a little bit 
surprised to find out that the specific demand these men the 
kidnappers are making and want the world to know seems to be 
precisely the same they made about two weeks after our kidnapping 
when alann steen made the videotape releaseing the 400 prisoners 
held in israeli jails we seem right back at ground zero 
one of the last words i heard today from one of them as they 
went out was that was still their demand i dont know if its 
still the same 400 prisoners or others 
besides that i dont think i have any other messages tat im 
supposed to be carrying to the people or governments of the world 
or the united nations as i say this is rather surprising 
id have thought things would have changed over the three years 
that some of those prisoners got released i dont know 
q what are your plans for the future 
a i really dont have any plans for the future yet except to 
see my wife mother sons and friends and family people i havent 
seen in three years or 39 months and together talk about things 
like that about the future

named one of bushs daily points of light for its efforts to 
protect the coral reefs 
its volunteers install buoys that sightseeing and fishing boats 
can tie up to instead of dropping anchor and damaging the reef 
craig quirolo who founded the group with his wife deevon urged 
the president in private not to lift a moratorium on drilling in 
three environmentally sensitive tracts two off the california 
coast and one here off the keys and everglades 
the moratorium has prevented oil companies that paid 109 
million for 73 leases on these tracts in the early 1980s from 
drilling exploratory wells 
bush has postponed for months his decision on whether to allow 
or ban drilling in pristine areas while defending the safety 
record of the oil industry on offshore drilling he has hinted 
before that he may be unwilling to subject the keys and the 
everglades to the risks of a spill 
bush a former oilman said quirolo raised with me the very 
sensitive question of offshore drilling i told him there would 
be an answer very very soon and i didnt think hed be too 
disappointed 
florida gov bob martinez and the small crowd of spectators 
applauded 
outlining the plan to close the sea lanes around the keys to 
ships longer than 50 meters and oil or hazardous material 
freighters bush said 
the exxon valdez disaster has made us all painfully aware of 
the ecological devastation which can result from a major oil 
spill 
he called floridas multihued coral reefs one of the most 
diverse ecosystems in the world and a unique national treasure 
three ships have run aground and damaged reefs in the past six 
months in the sea lanes bush wants closed

many lawmakers are having second thoughts 
about soviet president mikhail gorbachev because of his stance on 
lithuania and may block trade agreements that moscow wants two 
congressional leaders said sunday 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan and house majority 
leader thomas foley dwash said the united states shouldnt do 
any economic favors for gorbachev as long as he continues to punish 
the breakaway baltic republic 
president bush meanwhile said sunday he has not decided how to 
respond to the soviet unions economic squeeze against lithuania 
i cant tell you i honestly have made that determination 
no bush said during a brief meeting with reporters in 
islamorada fla 
before flying back to washington on sunday from a fishing 
vacation bush also said he did not know when he would meet with 
leaders of congress on lithuania as the white house said last week 
he would 
i dont have any plans for a meeting tomorrow bush said 
it might be on monday but i dont think thats scheduled 
bush has a regularly scheduled meeting with lawmakers set for 
tuesday but white house officials have said that is not 
necessarily the session where he will take up lithuania 
secretary of state james a baker iii has said that any us 
action probably would be focused in the commercial field such as 
suspending negotiations for a trade agreement with moscow 
dole said there is disillusionment with gorbachev who has 
espoused the soviet policies of perestroika and glasnost because 
of his tactics on lithuania 
moscow reportedly has shut off oil and gas supplies and 
intercepted food to lithuania in an attempt to force lithuanian 
officials to rescind a declaration of independence 
i think right now a lot of us have put him on hold now he 
is backtracking on lithuania dole said and a lot of us are 
having second thoughts 
bush has been treading cautiously on the lithuania issue but he 
has indicated he may try to make gorbachev pay an economic price 
for cracking down on lithuania 
marlin fitzwater bushs spokesman has said the president will 
announce what he plans to do about lithuania this week after 
meeting with members of congress 
both dole and foley appearing on abctvs this week with 
david brinkley said strains over lithuania shouldnt derail the 
ussoviet arms control summit set for next month 
the summit ought to continue at this point foley said 
added dole if its in our interest lets proceed 
the congressional leaders said however congress might stop 
trade agreements that gorbachev wants to help pump up his countrys 
sagging economy 
anything that benefits the soviet union we ought to slowwalk 
it dole said 
foley agreed adding the bush administration should try to 
encourage negotiations between moscow which wants to see its 
nation kept intact and lithuania which wants selfdetermination 
both men said it would be virtually impossible for the united 
states to provide direct aid to lithuania any shipments of oil 
would be stopped by the soviet navy in the baltic sea and an 
airlift would be difficult to carry out

the government said sunday it put up 18 
million to help establish a jewish settlement in the old citys 
christian quarter that has raised a storm of protest from 
palestinians 
while the housing ministrys statement said it acted completely 
legally leftwing legislator yossi sarid said he wanted the state 
prosecutor to investigate whether laws were broken 
this just shows that the government acted provocatively 
proving how dangerous it is for the country sarid said in a 
telephone interview 
the government statement is the first confirmation of official 
involvement in buying up arab property in the walled old city 
captured by israel during the 1967 middle east war 
the settlement of 150 jews in the complex not far from the 
church of the holy sepulchre on april 11 has set off angry 
demonstrations by christian clerics and palestinians both 
christian and moslem 
it also has brought a series of legal moves by the greek 
orthodox church which owns the building and wants the jews evicted 
the 18 million passed from the housing ministry to a 
subsidiary trusteeship of the jewish national fund the ministrys 
statement said the fund part of the quasigovernmental jewish 
agency was created in 1901 to acquire land for the founding of 
israel 
the money then went to a panamanian company sbc that bought 
leasing rights to four 100yearold buildings owned by the greek 
orthodox church and then rented the space to a religious jewish 
group which created the settlement 
justice ministry spokeswoman eti eshed said sunday that in early 
april a cabinet committee allotted 4 million for redeeming 
property in arab east jerusalem which includes the old city 
she said this money also was turned over to the jewish national 
fund subsidiary 
the settlement called neot david is the only jewish presence 
in the old citys christian sector its spokesmen have consistently 
said no government money was involved in the settlement 
removal of the the settlers has been blocked by appeals the 
supreme court has ruled that they can stay at least until the next 
court hearing thursday 
jerusalems old city is divided into separate districts for 
moslems jews and christians and many palestinian christians saw 
the settlement as a threat to their place in the holy city 
the old city is on land captured from jordan in the 1967 middle 
east war israel has annexed the area but most foreign nations 
including the united states do not recognize israels sovereignty 
the united states has repeatedly said it considers jewish 
settlements on occupied land to be an obstacle to peace 
the hebrew daily maariv reported sunday that caretaker prime 
minister yitzhak shamir ordered the housing ministry to buy real 
estate in the old city in 1983 but the purchases were blocked by 
the labor party 
avi pazner a spokesman for shamir was asked about the report 
and replied we know nothing about this 
in a related development sunday egypt criticized israel on new 
settlements in occupied arab territories 
these procedures which have been approved by israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir reveal the measures that without doubt 
threaten to complicate any effort to a peaceful settelement the 
egyptian foreign ministry said in a release

hussein musawi the lebanese shiite 
leader who was an influential figure in negotiating the release of 
hostage robert polhill was once an advocate of kidnapping 
foreigners and launching terrorist attacks against the west 
but in recent years the 45yearold leader of the militant 
islamic amal faction in syriancontrolled east lebanon has moved 
away from the influence of irans hardliners and into syrias more 
moderate orbit 
musawi is the only lebanese shiite leader who publicly admits he 
coordinates with the hostages captors and has influence over them 
his islamic amal part of the proiranian hezbollah militia 
advocates strong links with syria 
hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella organization for shiite 
moslem splinter groups holding most of the 18 western hostages in 
lebanon 
musawis success in influencing the release of polhill 
highlights new efforts by iranian president hashemi rafsanjani 
leader of tehrans socalled pragmatists and syrian president 
hafez assad irans main arab ally to end the longrunning hostage 
drama and advance relations with the west 
but musawis exact role in the release is not known and the 
question remains whether his influence will extend beyond the 
islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine which released 
polhill to other shiite factions that hold hostages 
syria hopes that mediating the release of us hostages will 
persuade the united states to improve relations and take it off the 
list of countries sponsoring terrorism 
but antiwestern iranian radicals and their militant shiite 
allies in lebanon have oppose releasing any of the hostages 
irans move to improve relations with the west and release 
hostages began in earnest in june after the death of the islamic 
nations revolutionary spiritual leader ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini 
but the breakthrough appears to have come in august when musawi 
was deposed from the leadership of hezbollah or party of god 
a wellinformed shiite source speaking on condition of 
anonymity said musawi was dropped from hezbollahs 12man majlis 
alshura or council of advice for what it called dual loyalty 
they considered he was more loyal to syria than to iran the 
source said 
musawi denies that he was dismissed from the council and 
hezbollah has refused to comment 
musawi has strong influence over groups holding some of the 
hostages he told an aug 6 news conference that some members of 
proiranian organizations holding most of the 18 western hostages 
at that time are known to us and we hold consultations with them 
from time to time 
if i said that we did not know anyone from these groups or 
there was no contact between us you should not believe it he 
said 
the hostageholders musawi declared may listen to 
usbecause our voice is closer to them and were living together 
after all we live in lebanon we live in the southern suburbs 
of beirut we live in baalbek and the south we know who does 
what he added 
musawis influence with the islamic jihad for the liberation of 
palestine could indicate they may free the two other american 
hostages they hold alann steen and jesse turner 
musawi founded islamic amal in 1982 after he was dismissed from 
the mainstream shiite amal movement for appearing more loyal to 
iran then to syria 
he returned to his home village of nabi sheet in the 
syriancontroled bekaa valley and founded islamic amal which he 
aligned with hezbollah 
musawi one source said is not a fanatical shiite hes 
ambitious and smart he wanted to enjoy syrias backing for his 
movement on the ground and the spiritual shiite attachment to 
khomeini and he succeeded in doing that for quite a while 
from 1982 until last summer musawi was an virulent supporter of 
almost all terrorist operations carried out by proiranian factions 
but when a power struggle developed in iran between rafsanjani 
and antiwestern radicals led by former interior minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi musawi favored the syrian line and the hardliners 
dropped him from hezbollahs command the shiite source said 
it was then that musawi started working for the release of 
foreign captives the source noted

the killing of the seventh cabbie in just over 
six weeks prompted mayor david dinkins on sunday to order 
steppedup police action including undercover officers as drivers 
dinkins called the killings a public crisis and a threat 
to the entire city 
police say believe one killer was responsible for the killings 
of three cab drivers earlier in the bronx presumably during 
robbery attempts 
they were trying to determine if killings sunday in the bronx 
and saturday in brooklyn were related investigators have said they 
are unsure if two other earlier killings are related 
all but one of the drivers killed worked for car services which 
generally dispatch cabs to pick up customers who telephone that is 
distinct from the socalled yellow or medallion cabs which make up 
the bulk of the citys fleet and which cruise the streets looking 
for passengers 
the mayor noted the importance of car services in outer often 
poor neighborhoods largely abandoned by cruising yellow cabs for 
fear of crime and for lack of paying passengers for the return trip 
to manhattan 
these killings represent more than a brutal attack on the 
drivers who have fallen victim dinkins said they have also 
become an assault on a vital link in our transportation system 
car service companies report they have lost anywhere from a 
quarter to half of their night drivers since the killings began 
march 7 said tony carter a spokesman for the city taxi and 
limousine commission 
they havent been quitting he said they just havent 
been showing up for work for fear for their lives 
the body of the latest victim whose name was withheld was 
found sunday morning in his car in the bronx he had been shot in 
the head 
the driver shot saturday in brooklyn was identified as ferdinand 
jeannot 27 
the bullet that killed him was fired from the back seat and went 
through a plastic partition police said they speculated the 
gunman may have intended to rob jeannot but couldnt reach his 
wallet containing 100 because of the partition and because the 
two front doors were locked 
the three connected shootings involved car service drivers all 
called to pick up a passenger late at night in the same general 
area 
ballistics tests have shown the bullets were from the same 
22caliber gun robbery was the presumed motive 
investigators had yet to determine whether one or both of the 
weekend shootings were connected to the earlier ones 
certainly theres some similarities said police lt donald 
f stephenson 
the mayor ordered police commissioner lee brown to expand a 
30member task force assigned to finding the killer or killers 
mitch kossoff a dispatcher for riteway ii dialaride service 
in the bronx said the practice of picking up fares on the street 
has ground to a halt 
most of the employees are very shaky especially the night 
drivers he said i can tell by the way guys are talking 
theyre not even looking for street work 
many of the drivers believe the spree is the work of copycat 
killers he said i just think its a bunch of crazy guys out 
there 
nine car service drivers have been killed this year last year 
32 drivers of various kinds of cabs were killed on the job 
according to police and the taxi commission

here is the text of the editorial in 
mondays edition of the englishlanguage tehran times daily on the 
hostage issue the iranian newspaper often reflects the views of 
irans president hashemi rafsanjani 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the release of the first western hostage in beirut is now a 
reality this necessitates that those involved should now even 
enhance their wellintentioned common moves and cooperation and 
expedite their efforts to ensure the continuation of the release 
process for all the hostages 
undoubtedly and for a fact the settlement of the hostage issue 
in lebanon and occupied palestine is beyond any single country it 
requires an allout effort on the part of all the concerned parties 
the islamic republic in using its spiritual clout along this 
line virtually left no stone unturned 
the iranians painstaking and continuous efforts in this 
connection over the recent months have actually proven that the 
whole thing is a highly complicated matter 
one just cannot hope to achieve anything without paying due 
attention to the rightful demands of the lebanese groups involved 
the tehran times believes that to contribute to the 
establishment of a general atmosphere of trust the lebanese groups 
should release another american hostage 
by doing so they once more prove their goodwill and 
preparedness for the settlement of the issue 
the lebanese groups will certainly find it hard to comply with 
this request and their position is quite understandable 
but perhaps the release of one hostage alone will not be enough 
to establish the kind of overwhelming trust needed to bring the 
whole hostage crisis to an end 
but for both the lebanese groups and the islamic republic 
officials it is islamic and humane considerations that count most 
goodwill should not come from one side only it is a twoway 
street 
the tehran times however from the very beginning has believed 
in the unconditional freedom of all hostages on islamic and 
humanitarian grounds only 
this daily believes that the release process must be expedited 
by acts of goodwill by the concerned party on the other side 
to negotiate with lebanese groups which have been subject to 
all kinds of hardship under israeli aggression and while scores of 
their brothers are held in captivity in lebanon and occupied 
palestine is certainly not an easy task 
their trampled rights should never be eclipsed by anything even 
the islamic republic will not succeed in its efforts to get the 
hostages released if it fails to consider the rightful demands of 
these oppressed groups 
but if the other party too displays its goodwill iranian 
efforts can be facilitated to ensure the release of all hostages in 
1990 
we do believe that the lebanese groups should still free a 
second american hostage with no preconditions this they should do 
swiftly in order to leave the ball in the other partys court to 
demonstrate its goodwill if it has any 
in fact the iranian people and government have no faith in the 
us administration but perhaps it is now time to test president 
bushs claims that goodwill begets goodwill

the strength of truly blessed is its tone 
of sincerity simplicity and dignity plus the joyful noise of its 
music 
truly blessed which opened at broadways longacre theater 
on sunday afternoon is the story of the great gospel singer 
mahalia jackson performed by queen esther marrow also a respected 
gospel singer miss marrow had the idea for truly blessed and 
wrote some of the songs that compellingly tell the story 
there also are traditional spirituals st louis blues 
which miss jackson known as haley listened to as a girl 
and hes got the whole world in his hand a song identified 
with miss jackson in her last years 
four singers provide a chorus all of them can be occasionally 
shrill but miss marrow never is her voice in a lower register 
like miss jacksons is a straightforward power and doesnt need 
excitementseeking high flourishes 
one difference miss jackson bent her notes in a bluesy way more 
than miss marrow does miss marrow obviously decided not to imitate 
a combo of musicians is at one side of the stage a platform 
with two sets of steps fills the rest of the space backed by what 
looks like big organ pipes miss marrow wears a succession of choir 
robes housedress blue wedding dress suits and gowns she talks 
between songs 
mahalia jackson wouldnt sing in nightclubs early in truly 
blessed miss marrow always in character says that she could 
have sung the blues but she liked singing gospel because they were 
songs of hope that god could cure what was wrong you get done 
with the blues you got nothing to rest on 
miss jackson joined the greater salem baptist church choir after 
she moved to chicago with an aunt she and the quartet push chairs 
together to depict the lean years car travel with the johnson 
gospel singers one of the first professional touring gospel 
groups they discuss a preacher who thought miss jacksons joyful 
noise was too jazzy and the discomforts of not being able to stop 
the car in the south 
brief scenes show miss jackson singing at a mayor richard daley 
rally in chicago marrying sigmond galloway and everybody dancing 
at a restaurant afterwards praying before singing at carnegie 
hall marching with martin luther king and readying to sing in 
europe and visit the holy land 
a longer scene in which miss jackson is asked dumb esoteric 
questions at a convention of musicologists is contrived but funny 
robert kalfin directs producers are howard hurst philip rose 
and sophie hurst in association with frankie hewitt truly 
blessed was first produced at fords theater in washington 
house lights go on twice to show people clapping along but the 
show isnt a raveup its lively but respectful of the artist who 
first impressed many in the world of the value of gospel music

the defense minister said 
argentina has halted development of a mediumrange missile that 
arms control experts said could carry a chemical or nuclear 
warhead newspapers reported sunday 
the condor 2 project is paralyzed it is not going ahead 
because of a political decision and the lack of funds the 
defense minister humberto romero said in remarks reported in 
several newspapers sunday the project is frozen 
development of the missile began in the 1980s and diplomatic 
sources have said iraq provided financing and egypt lent 
techological expertise 
the condor 2 missile which argentina has stressed would only be 
used to launch satellites is reportedly powerful enough to carry a 
3300pound warhead 625 miles arms experts have repeatedly stated 
that the missile could carry a nuclear or chemical warhead 
in his remarks romero said the development of the missile in 
no way signified a risk or danger to anyone 
in september president carlos menem reportedly told president 
bush that argentina was considering ending the condor project 
in may assistant secretary of state allen holmes told a senate 
armed services subcommittee that the development of the condor 2 
was years behind schedule and we believe this can be traced to 
problems in acquiring technology 
he said nations that are signatories to the missile technology 
control regime had been denying argentina the technology necessary 
for the rockets development 
the missile treaty was established to limit the spread of 
rockets to the third world and has been signed by nations including 
the united states japan west germany britain france italy and 
canada 
egypt apparently dropped out of the condor project several 
months ago partially due to pressure from the united states 
iraqs missile program has been rapidly advancing in december 
iraqs minister of industry and military industrialization hussein 
kamel announced that baghdad had launched a threestage rocket 
capable of launching satellites 
iraqi officials also claimed iraq had testfired two 
surfacetosurface missiles with ranges of 1240 miles

the admission by gubernatorial candidate 
clayton williams that he patronized prostitutes as a young man 
raises new questions about his attitudes toward women his 
opponents campaign said sunday 
in recent months the republican nominee has made several 
comments which taken together drive this wedge between men and 
women and i think thats unfortunate said glenn smith manager 
of state treasurer ann richards campaign for governor 
smith said ms richards the democratic candidate was 
vacationing and would not comment on williams admissions which 
appeared sunday in the houston post 
ive never claimed to be a perfect man williams told the 
newspaper in discussing his use of prostitutes its part of 
growing up in west texas 
its like the larry mcmurtry book the last picture show 
said the fort stockton native a 58yearold political neophyte who 
won the gop nomination last month after spending millions of 
dollars of his own money 
williams was in arizona on sunday and unavailable to answer 
questions 
his press secretary bill kenyon released the following 
statement 
one of claytons greatest strengths as a person is one of his 
greatest weaknesses as a politician he always tries to be 
honest when clayton was tracked down by a reporter chasing 
outlandish rumors about claytons past that have been fanned by the 
richards campaign and other democrats he dismissed them as absurd 
most politicians would have stopped there the statement 
continued but when the reporter went further and asked if he had 
ever visited a prostitute clayton surprised some folks by 
conceding once again that hes not perfect and by telling the truth 
about incidents earlier in his life even when it wasnt 
politically expedient 
last month williams stirred criticism from womens groups by 
making a joking about rape he later apologized 
williams interviewed during an independent oil group meeting in 
scottsdale ariz told the post he paid prostitutes a number of 
times in texas and mexico he said it had been at least 35 years 
since he did so 
as a teenager its part of growing up in west texas you go 
to mexico its part of the fun he said 
williams added that he patronized prostitutes while a student at 
texas aampm university adding that it was kind of what the boys 
did at aampm he said it was a lot different in those days the 
houses were the only place you got serviced then 
prostitution is illegal in texas and was illegal 35 years ago 
it is legal in parts of mexico 
in a telephone interview from houston smith said williams 
private behavior is best left to him and his family and not a 
legitimate subject for a campaign 
but he also said williams comments about women should be a 
topic of debate he implies that women are here to service men 
that kind of an attitude is as insulting to men as it is to 
women smith said 
ms richards won the democratic nomination on april 10 after a 
mudslinging runoff campaign in which her opponent attorney general 
jim mattox accused her of using illegal drugs as recently as 10 
years ago but offered no evidence 
ms richards a recovering alcoholic declined to answer 
questions about illegal drug use saying her addiction had been 
alcohol and that public discussions might discourage others from 
seeking treatment 
during a cattle roundup on his ranch last month williams 
likened bad weather to rape and said that if it was inevitable 
just relax and enjoy it the next day he said he was sorry and 
said he realized his comment was insensitive 
however during a visit to washington before the democratic 
runoff williams told reporters he would feel uncomfortable running 
against a woman 
the millionaire businessmanrancher won the gop nomination with 
61 percent of the vote in a sevenman race march 13 after spending 
more than 8 million on the race including 6 million of his own 
funds 
in his interview with the post williams said the final decision 
belongs to voters but that he doesnt believe that a candidates 
private life as a youth should have any bearing on his ability to 
lead 
if doing drugs 10 years ago is all right then certainly i 
think going to a mexican border town 40 years ago is all right 
williams said alluding to allegations against ms richards

but in vilnius andrei n girenko a secretary of the soviet

saying that only oil and natural gas were affected 
this is only a small part of the products that are supplied 
he said plans for a total blockade dont exist

independence they lost in 1940 when they were occupied and forcibly 
annexed to the soviet union lithuania has declared independence

president bush welcomed the release of 
an american hostage sunday but declared that i dont have 
forgiveness in my heart as long as one american is held against his 
will 
bush emphasized that the release of robert polhill was not 
enough to warrant a goodwill gesture from him other than words of 
thanks toward the kidnappers or the countries they follow 
im not trying to think up any gesture bush said in 
response to a question i want all of those hostages out were 
not going to trade 
bush learned of polhills release while on a daylong fishing 
expedition in the florida keys he was kept updated by 
shiptoshore communications with the white house situation room 
as polhill relished his first day of freedom in 39 months seven 
other americans remained in the captivity of terrorists in lebanon 
i cant talk forgiveness bush said i dont have 
forgiveness in my heart as long as one american is held against his 
will and as long as one family has a broken heart 
he said he talked by telephone with polhill his wife and his 
mother and that they all noted that other americans are still 
hostage 
this is a mission uncompleted bush said 
polhill was to be flown to a us military medical facility in 
wiesbaden west germany for a physical examination a state 
department hostage recovery team was dispatched to aid 
polhills return to freedom and us officials offered 
transportation to west germany for polhills family 
in a written statement bush expressed thanks to iran and syria 
for efforts leading to polhills freedom iran particularly has 
been a us adversary for more than a decade and syria has been 
denounced as a sponsor of terrorism 
however bush omitted iran from his words of appreciation in a 
later facetoface meeting with reporters 
i have goodwill toward syria for playing an active role in 
this release he said 
as for iran he said he was stopping a little short 
i dont want to give credit when i dont know the facts he 
said 
from the day he became president bush has been promising that 
goodwill begets goodwill an apparent invitation to the 
kidnappers as well as syria and iran to free the americans 
yet on sunday bush said he was not making any goodwill gesture 
merely because one hostage polhill was freed 
i dont go ante up one step and another bush said i 
rejoice at this release and i will thank those who facilitated 
the release and thats exactly the way its going to stay 
in his earlier written statement bush had said his feeling of 
satisfaction over polhills release was substantially tempered 
because other us citizens and westerners are still in captivity 
he said nothing short of the release of all hostages would 
satisfy him 
thats the ground rules he said in the statement thats 
the bottom line 
separately white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
we would hope that this release would be the forerunner to the 
release of others and would pave the way towards the goodwill 
begets goodwill summation at some point but at this point with 
seven hostages still in captivity the situation has not changed a 
great deal 
bush underscored that any response would await release of all 
the hostages he called hostagetaking an immoral practice 
that has to stop 
in washington secretary of state james baker iii reaffirmed the 
administrations position against making deals for hostages 
our policy is that we do not negotiate with hostageholders 
and we do not make deals for hostages he said and the reason 
we dont is because we think that will simply lead to more and more 
hostagetaking 
bush himself made no further comments upon his return to the 
white house sunday evening 
notwithstanding the administrations posture rep lee hamilton 
dind chairman of the house foreign affairs subcommittee on the 
mideast said polhills release would make it appropriate for the 
united states to send some kind of a gesture that were willing to 
enter into a dialogue with iran 
and in new york kamal kharazzi irans ambassador to the united 
nations said his government was very hopeful that this process 
would be sped up and more hostages would be released but he said 
that depends on the policies that the other sides would adopt 
before bush spoke directly with reporters fitzwater expressed 
the presidents appreciation for whatever roles iran and syria 
played in polhills release 
there were no deals no negotiations with the hostage 
takers said fitzwater we have no way of identifying any 
specific action on our part that could have been a contributing 
factor to the release 
concerning iran which has bedeviled the united states in a 
string of hostage events over the past 10 years fitzwater said 
we do recognize their role we do show some gratitude for any 
help they may have given in this case we continue to indicate that 
this is a course of action that does beget good will 
bush and fitzwater both said they did not know whether iran 
played a big role in the polhill release but fitzwater said we 
have always felt that iran has control or influence over the 
hostages we continue to believe that 
kharazzi appearing with hamilton on cbstvs face the 
nation said the situation was complex with different groups 
having different demands holding the hostages he said iran does 
not have influence over all the captors 
for days syria and iran had been fueling hopes of an imminent 
hostage release by the islamic jihad for the liberation of 
palestine the group has held three american educators seized from 
beirut university college polhill 55 of new york jesse turner 
42 of boise idaho and alann steen a native of boston who 
turned 51 sunday 
while expressing pleasure over polhills release bush said 
our satisfaction is substantially tempered by the knowledge 
that seven other innocent americans as well as a number of foreign 
nationals are still being cruelly held hostage in lebanon 
we cannot rest until all hostages are free he said once 
again we urgently call on all parties who hold hostages or who 
have any influence to work to obtain the immediate and 
unconditional release of the remaining hostages as a humanitarian 
gesture 
among the 18 western hostages believed held in lebanon eight 
are americans the longest held is terry anderson chief middle 
east correspondent of the associated press who was seized march 
16 1985 
bush has never spelled out how he might reciprocate following 
the hostages release 
iran is thought to be interested in obtaining billions of 
dollars in assets frozen after americans were taken hostage at the 
us embassy in tehran in 1979 
syria is trying to move back into the arab mainstream after 
years of isolation and apparently is hoping to improve its image 
in the west

palestinians were wounded in stonethrowing confrontations with 
israeli troops arab hospital officials said 
palestine liberation organization chief yasser arafat has urged 
palestinians to refrain from using guns during the uprising 
arguing israel would respond with harsher tactics to end the 
28monthlong uprising 
radical palestinian factions and moslem fundamentalists have 
supported the use of firearms 
the governing board of shas reached their decision to support 
the likud shortly after shamir met with the partys spiritual 
leader rabbi ovadia yosef and clarified his stance on the peace 
process israel tv reported

government 
both shamir and peres have been courting shas which holds five 
seats in parliament shas decision to back likud sunday leaves 
both major parties in a deadlock each controlling 60 of 
parliaments 120 seats

a reform communist won a runoff 
presidential election in slovenia sunday and a noncommunist 
centerright party led in parliamentary elections in the 
neighboring yugoslav republic of croatia 
the elections enabled voters in the two republics to choose 
among communist reformers and westernoriented leaders and could 
further divide the yugoslav federation 
communistruled serbia the largest of yugoslavias six 
republics has accused some leaders in the two republics of being 
fascist and bent on secession from the balkan nation of 23 million 
with 75 percent of the vote counted in slovenia reform 
communist milan kucan had 579 percent of the vote while his 
opponent joze pucnik won 421 percent 
kucan formerly headed the slovene communist party renamed the 
party of democratic reform pucnik leader of the fiveparty demos 
coalition has advocated slovenias secession from yugoslavia 
in croatia where more than 30 parties were entered in the 
republics first free multiparty elections in 51 years initial 
results showed the centerright croatian democratic union leading 
in 13 out of the first 25 constituencies where counting was under 
way 
it was not clear whether the trend would continue croatias 
threechamber parliament has 356 seats 
the reformist communist party was second with a lead in 10 
constituencies and the middleoftheroad coalition of national 
accord led in two districts 
sundays balloting was for the 116seat chamber of counties and 
the 80seat sociopolitical chamber 
an additional vote was to be held monday for 160 seats in the 
labour chamber 
some 2000 supporters of the croatian democratic union gathered 
in the zagreb electoral district of dubrava the home of party 
leader franjo tudjman to celebrate what they described as the 
victory of the croatian people 
i am convinced we will win an absolute majority and the union 
will form croatias first noncommunist administration tudjman 
said 
a second round of voting will be held in two weeks in 
constituencies where no candidate won a majority 
despite pucniks loss in slovenia demos will form the first 
noncommunist government in any of yugoslavias six republics in 45 
years two weeks ago it won 55 percent of the seats in slovenias 
regional legislature in the first round of elections 
kucan and pucnik emerged as frontrunners from firstround 
voting when kucan received 446 percent of the vote and pucnik 266 
percent a total of 14 million slovenians of a population of about 
2 million were eligible to vote 
yugoslavias last multiparty elections were held in 1939 
opposition groups claim that a ballot in 1945 was rigged by the 
communist party which thereafter banned all dissent and turned the 
country into a singleparty state 
the leader of the triumphant croatian party tudjman says his 
party favors a confederation in which all of yugoslavias six 
republics would have full sovereign rights it is not bent on 
secession he said denying the accusations from serbia 
following its victory in the first round of the slovenian 
elections demos has also softened its stand on independence 
since the death in 1980 of josip broz tito the strongwilled 
founder of communist yugoslavia a nineperson rotating presidency 
representing the countrys diverse ethnic makeup has headed the 
country under the guidance of the communist party but ethnic 
conflict and political dissent persist 
two other yugoslav republics bosnia and macedonia have allowed 
formation of opposition parties and are expected to schedule free 
elections soon 
but in serbia the largest constituent republic and the 
smallest region of montenegro the ruling communists have yet to 
formally legalize independent parties

four thousand teenagers from 36 
countries carrying the memories of 6 million jews killed by the 
nazis made a march of the living sunday from the auschwitz 
concentration camp to the crematoria of birkenau 
writer elie wiesel diplomats and israeli parliamentarians 
joined the young marchers for the twomile walk marking holocaust 
memorial day 
the march at the camp in southern poland was in memory of those 
who died in nazi death camps as well as in the warsaw ghetto 
uprising that began april 19 1943 
the sunny day turned eerily cloudy and light rain started as 
wiesel stood at a podium before a gray stone monument to recall his 
youth at auschwitz 
i see them forever i see them years and years ago i saw 
i cannot tell you what i saw im afraid that if i told you we 
would all wake up in tears and would not be able to stop i see a 
young girl he said before stopping apparently unable to 
continue and silently leaving the podium 
many cried as the students all wearing blue shirts some 
carrying israeli flags and others bouquets of flowers walked along 
the train tracks that ended at the cremetoria 
dandelions waved in the windswept grass now covering the rubble 
of the camp torches were lighted poems read and mournful violin 
songs played before a reading of the kaddish a jewish prayer for 
the dead 
television cameras positioned in former nazi watchtowers 
broadcast live to israel where solemn holocaust remembrance events 
were under way 
as the march began galia haber a jerusalem high school 
student recalled seeing the number the nazis tattoed on her 
grandmothers arm at auschwitz 
i remember when i saw her i thought of a supermarket with 
numbered goods and i thought did somebody buy her its very 
sad to think that my grandmother whom i love so much once was 
just a number she told israeli radio which broadcast the march 
live 
shawn tepper 17 of miami beach fla held hands with a row of 
other young american jews and said the experience was overwhelming 
but proved to everyone that we are alive we are together and we 
are strong 
sundays event was the second march of the living 
participants said it had special significance because of the drive 
toward german unification and israels rapid renewal of ties with 
eastern european countries that once had flourishing jewish 
communities 
the nazis built the auschwitz complex in southern poland as the 
main engine of hitlers final solution estimates of the death

could contribute to peace in southeast asia

weeks time magazine that vietnam has met all the requirements set 
by the us government for improving relations

missing in action in the war in vietnam reunification of 
vietnamese families and human rights abuses in reeducation camps 
but in the state department there is no change toward 
vietnam he complained 
normal relations between the us and vietnam could contribute 
to peace and cooperation in southeast asia and to maintaining the 
independence of this area visavis china thach said during the 
interview which was conducted in hanoi 
he said the united states was using vietnams continued military 
presence in neighboring cambodia as an excuse to avoid normalizing 
relations with his country 
the cambodian problem serves only as a pretext thatch said 
the greatest mistake of the us is not the vietnam war it is 
this strategy of using vietnam as a pawn in the relationship 
between china and the us 
it is time to heal the wounds of war he said i dont 
mention the physical or the mental wounds but the moral ones as

premier li peng left monday for the first visit 
in 26 years by a chinese head of government to the soviet union 
chinas longtime rival for leadership of the communist world 
lis fourday trip is intended to promote normal friendly 
relations and an easing of border tensions at a time when both 
countries are focused on serious internal problems 
the official chinese press hailed lis trip as being of 
profound significance to peace in asia and the world but it is 
expected to have few concrete effects on a relationship that has 
slowly improved in recent years after decades of mistrust 
the 61yearold premier is to hold at least two rounds of talks 
with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who in may made the 
first visit by a soviet leader to beijing in three decades 
gorbachevs historic visit was overshadowed by huge studentled 
democracy demonstrations in beijing which ended weeks later when 
li and other hardline chinese leaders brought in troops to crush 
the movement 
the two sides are expected to sign an agreement on fostering 
trade and will lay down guiding principles on easing military 
confrontation along their 4350mile frontier 
progress is unlikely on territorial disputes or cutbacks in the 
500000 soviet soldiers and more than 1 million chinese troops 
along the border 
china and the soviet union split over ideological differences in 
1960 and fought a brief border war in 1969 in 1972 china restored 
relations with the united states in part because then leader mao 
tsetung saw the soviet union as chinas most serious military 
threat 
western diplomats say improved relations with moscow do not mean 
china can play a soviet card against the united states as 
sinous relations deteriorate over humanrights issues 
china has stressed it will never be a soviet ally as it was in 
the 1950s and chinas inherent suspicions of soviet aims have 
grown with gorbachevs reform policies 
the ideological hardliners who now rule china reportedly blame 
gorbachev for the fall of communist parties in east europe and see 
his program of perestroika as leading to the demise of socialism

robert polhill is being bombarded by sensations and emotions 
after more than three years of captivity in lebanon and faces 
physical and mental challenges in the coming months former 
hostages said after his release sunday 
bob polhill probably only learned he was gonna be released 
about two hours ago former hostage david jacobsen said sunday

germany for debriefing and a medical examination 
polhill will have to grapple with guilt said retired air force 
col thomas e schaefer one of the 52 americans held hostage for 
444 days in iran 
one of the major things hell feel is why did they let me 
go schaefer said and the first thing i would tell him is 
to dont let it bother you because those guilt feelings are not 
substantiated 
in a telephone interview from peoria ariz schaefer said that 
on his release in january 1981 he felt guilty that hed been 
captured and had put his family the nation and the air force 
through such an ordeal 
after schaefer was freed he opened an agency to help people 
deal with stress and adversity 
schaefer 59 said polhill will probably spend the next few days 
physically recovering from his ordeal then try to regain some 
semblance of order in his life he said polhill will have to deal 
with changes in the world his loved ones and himself since he was 
taken captive 
hell get the best professional help in the world in 
wiesbaden and he will have access to whatever assistance he may 
need schaefer said 
jacobsen who was held in west beirut from may 1985 to november 
1986 said in a cbs news interview im reliving my release and 
the emotions of it 
in the hour drive to damascus from west beirut its been the 
first time hes been able to use all his senses to see more than 10 
feet away its probably the first time hes been out of doors in 
three years hes been held in a little basement dungeon most of 
that time jacobsen said 
hes being bombarded hes seing the stars hes seeing 
people hes hearing noises hes smelling the breeze and 
everything the former hostage said 
he is going to be thinking about his friends who remain 
behind wishing that they could be sharing that moment jacobsen 
said hes going to be very concerned that he says nothing that 
in any way would jeopardize the welfare of his friends 
in an interview later with syrian television polhill said he 
was happy and grateful to people who worked on his case but 
remained deeply concerned about fellow captives alann steen and 
jesse turner 
polhill was being taken to wiesbaden west germany for 
debriefing and a medical examination us officials said 
schaefer said polhills next step will probably be dealing with 
the press and requests to speak 
it can be overpowering hell get thousands of requests 
schaefer said he has to learn to say no 
schaefer credited his own recovery to the hostage reception team 
and his wife anita 
he said it took him several months to get over his ordeal and 
that for weeks after his release he would wake up screaming in the 
middle of the night

lyndon johnson didnt steal the 
1948 senate election as a recent biography contends but a 
political boss might have rigged the election to get johnsons 
opponent says a close johnson associate 
joe b frantz now a history professor contends the election 
was stolen for johnson possibly without his knowledge by a 
disgruntled south texas political boss eager to derail the 
opponent coke stevenson 
johnson won the election by 87 votes out of almost a million 
cast collecting 99 percent of the south texas vote 
theres no question the election was stolen frantz said 
but he contends that political boss george parr filched it to spite 
stevenson not necessarily to help johnson 
frantz said he revealed the information at a recent historical 
society banquet because of accusations against johnson by robert a 
caro in means of ascent the second volume in caros biography 
of johnson 
frantz a white house aide under johson and former chairman of 
the university of texas history department teaches at corpus 
christi state university 
frantz put together the oral history project for the johnson 
presidential library in austin taping interviews with nearly 1000 
people including johnsons political enemies 
he said his information about parrs political vendetta against 
stevenson came from an interview he conducted with stevenson when 
the former governor was in his 80s stevenson died in 1975 at age 
87 
it would have been in the early 1970s frantz told the 
associated press he set me down and he said im going to give 
you the straight story 
stevenson and parr had always been close allies stevenson told 
frantz until parr asked stevenson then governor to name a 
certain man judge at laredo 
stevenson refused because the fellow was an absolute rascal 
and into evey sort of political sin available frantz said 
parr promised revenge the professor said 
the feeling is that parr decided im going to teach coke 
stevenson a lesson and at the same time get in very good with the 
new senator from texas frantz said 
frantz was unable to locate parr to interview him before parr 
died in the mid1970s 
frantz said he interviewed the man responsible for disposing of 
votes from a contested box before a recount could be held 
he said he came away from the encounter convinced the south 
texans were guilty of stuffing the box which disappeared after the 
count with illegal votes 
they were a bunch of rascals he said 
frantz said he thought caros characterization of johnson in his 
first volume the path to power was slanted against his 
subject 
he said that he felt that in the second book caro expressed 
annoyance as if johnson had pulled off the dirtiest steal in 
history he doesnt see things in the context of the times 
we didnt know what a secret ballot was frantz said i 
grew up in weatherford and all the precincts used to vote in the 
same room in the courthouse and all the courthouse hangerson would 
stand around and watch you 
it was not at all unusual for campaigners to know how a vote was 
going before balloting ended he said and for people to round up 
votes midway through the voting to counteract trends 
i was sort of amused by robert caros almost innocence in how 
dirty all this was said frantz former director of the texas 
state historical association when the national press seized on 
it its like he expected some sort of local paradox down here 
actually its no dirtier than anywhere else

in the church where he preached for 30 years the 
rev ralph david abernathy was mourned sunday by civil rights 
leaders and citizens as a man high up on the honor roll of the 
battle for racial equality 
about 300 people lined up sunday afternoon after the regular 
service at the west hunter street baptist church where the civil 
rights leader was pastor from 1961 until his death last week at age 
64 
the rev jesse jackson martin luther king iii and former 
atlanta mayor andrew young and robert f kennedy jr were among 
those mourning the man who marched and worked beside the rev 
martin luther king jr in the 1960s but who angered many activists 
with an autobiography they feel belittled kings memory 
and the walls came tumbling down published last year 
described king as having liaisons with women the night he was 
assassinated in 1968 
many of those who criticized the book have since abernathys 
death focused on his work helping king build the southern christian 
leadership conference and pressing the case of equal rights for 
blacks 
at an evening memorial service abernathys son kwame told the 
congregation his father was a truly selfless leader 
abide in love was one of the last things my daddy said 
the younger abernathy recalled 
jackson and young who worked with abernathy and king in the 
1960s did not speak to the crowd but embraced on the podium above 
the casket 
after the service young a candidate for georgia governor said 
abernathys sacrifices helped make youngs political successes 
possible 
ive never forgotten that and i wont ever forget it young 
said 
jackson said abernathys death means a time for pause and 
reflection among kings former aides 
all of us have a profound sense of loss jackson said we 
must judge him on what he meant to our struggle and he was high up 
on the honor roll 
the rev robert g grant president of the american freedom 
coalition in washington commented on the epitaph abernathys wrote 
for himself i tried grant said yes ralph you did try 
you tried to bring your people those normal things of life that 
most people take for granted 
abernathy who was kings closest friend and advisor died april 
17 of a heart attack induced by a blood clot funeral services are 
scheduled for noon monday at west hunter 
most of those who lined up early either were members of 
abernathys church or residents of the neighborhood the mourners 
some of whom carried children walked quietly past the coffin and 
several touched the sleeves of his white ministers robe 
family members viewed abernathys body privately then left the 
church one of abernathys daughters donzaleigh abernathy bosley 
arranged flowers around her fathers open casket and placed a 
single red rose in his left hand 
she wont leave him a church aide whispered to another 
ethel bell 83 a member of west hunter since 1932 said 
abernathy hinted during a february sermon that he expected to die 
he said he had really enjoyed being pastor she said he 
said he wanted us to always get along that tells you something 
morning services were sad but proceeded as usual said church 
member juanita h gardner 
every now and then there was a cry out of sadness she said 
its a little sadder thats to be expected

real estate problems are spreading from the 
southwest and northeast threatening metropolitan markets across 
the nation according to a new statistical analysis by banking 
regulators 
banks in regions already beset with falling or flat real estate 
prices have responded by tightening their lending policies an 
analysis by the federal deposit insurance corp shows that lenders 
elsewhere also may have reason for concern 
the fdic which insures bank and savings and loan deposits up to 
100000 has fashioned what it hopes will be an early warning 
system that identifies soft real estate markets before they turn 
sour 
a preliminary version released last week examined commercial 
real estate in 40 metropolitan areas some wellknown sore spots in

it was like a journey back in time when the 
national aids commission traveled to south georgia last week for a 
firsthand look at how rural areas are coping with the deadly 
disease 
im afraid were seeing history repeat itself said dr june 
osborn chairwoman of the panel after the commission spent two 
days in waycross albany and macon visiting with aids patients and 
talking with health care professionals 
the same fear the same isolation for people with aids the 
same difficulty in mobilizing coordinated care that we saw in the 
beginning of the urban epidemic back a few years ago is happening 
all over again she said 
the commissions trip came on the heels of a federal centers for 
disease control report that aids is spreading more rapidly in rural 
areas than in cities from 1988 to 1989 the cdc found that 
nonmetropolitan areas had a 37 percent increase in new aids cases 
while metro areas had only a 5 percent gain

the paneuropean stock market is proving an 
elusive dream 
europes major exchanges agree there should be one market in the 
big european stocks to provide greater liquidity and efficiency 
but they disagree over how to create it 
the efforts have been slow piecemeal and contradictory this 
is increasingly helping londons aggressive international stock 
exchange dominate the european financial centers 
europe has 39 national and major regional stock exchanges 
trading about 300 major european stocks 
fragmented structurally diverse they not only compete with 
each other but with less formal trading systems comprised of 
telephone links and computerized videoscreen networks 
moreover they soon will face competition from the national 
association of securities dealers automated quotations also known 
as nasdaq the american screenbased overthecounter market plans 
to begin operating during european hours in the third quarter of 
this year 
the demand for a paneuropean market comes from big 
international institutional investors who want to trade in 
europes stocks in a single market in the european time zone 
andrew hugh smith chairman of londons exchange a year ago 
said the answer was a europewide screenbased trading system 
which london already has 
addressing a conference in frankfurt last month hugh smith 
proposed a joint initiative by london and the german federation of 
stock exchanges as the critical mass the focus upon which a 
truly european market could be built 
regis rousselle head of the paris exchange has suggested 
creating a single european list of 300 major stocks that could be 
traded on any exchange 
the federation of european community stock exchanges meanwhile 
is planning le pipe a system to provide european stock prices 
and company information a single network will transmit data 
prepared by the 12 common market exchanges and it might develop 
into a trading system 
the major investment firms increasingly are engaging in informal 
paneuropean trading through their own computerized videoscreens 
away from the exchanges but this leaves investors less protected 
because theres less surveillance to detect cheating and 
irregularities 
europes exchanges have talked for decades about cooperating 
and it was hoped action would replace words with the approach of 
1992 when the eec theoretically becomes a barrierfree marketplace 
of 320 million consumers 
but stewart gilchrist a director of scottish amicable 
investment managers a glasgowbased institutional investor said 
i dont think we are particularly optimistic 
frank lewis executive director of european trading at shearson 
lehman hutton international inc in london said a paneuropean 
market was an impractical ideal 
every local market is always going to fight to maintain their 
local autonomy and their individuality lewis said theres 
also a hesitancy on the part of the customers 
for instance someone investing in portugal is likely to believe 
that a portuguese broker is the bestqualified to offer advice 
lewis said that is the perception and is to a large degree true 
and can be overcome but its an uphill battle 
londons exchange has used a screenbased system called seaq 
international for five years enabling it to win business from 
other european exchanges and develop substantial trade in 
international shares 
it also benefits from being englishspeaking and better 
established than its continental counterparts 
hugh smith estimated that about onefifth of west german stock 
trading takes place in london where trade in nonbritish shares 
grew to 505 billion in february from 41 billion in september 
london accounted for 35 percent of europes total market 
capitalization of 18 trillion at the end of 1988 figures 
provided by londons exchange show germany came in second with 13 
percent and france third with 115 percent 
the market capitalization figure represents the total value of 
all domestic shares listed on the major exchanges 
west germany is fighting back by modernizing last year it 
launched a screenbased reporting system called ibis which 
provides prices in bluechip stocks to the countrys eight 
exchanges 
one hurdle to harmonization is the wide differences in the way 
the exchanges make the final swap of cash for shares known as the 
clearing and settlement process the exchanges face competition 
from private companies operating as clearing houses 
britains system is among the worst piling up huge backlogs to 
remedy this londons exchange will start operating a paperless 
settlement system called taurus in october 1991 
londons trading is quotedriven with many market makers 
competing for business by offering the best price they have 
abandoned the exchange floor for screens and phones in their 
offices 
but this method has generated such fierce competition that it 
has driven many market makers out of the british equities business 
the sluggish volume following the october 1987 stock market crash 
hasnt helped 
other major exchanges are orderdriven with buyers and 
sellers matched at a central point by market makers known as 
specialists 
their role is similar to that of new york stock exchange 
specialists who are entrusted with the responsibility of keeping 
markets orderly partly through buying and selling shares from 
their own inventories 
the weakness of the continents trading centers became evident 
during the nearcrash last october many of the exchanges shut down 
when they couldnt handle the flood of sell orders 
many european exchanges not london also have circuit 
breakers which limit how far shares can fluctuate in a session 
europes exchanges have scrambled to modernize and deregulate in 
recent years the growth of competition in the 1980s has broken 
down many clubby cartels with their fixed high commissions and 
webs of regulations 
britain led with big bang the sweeping 1986 deregulation 
that allowed foreign firms and commercial banks to deal in 
securities and permitted more participants to make markets in 
stocks

if a catholic priest from new york has his 
way philip morris cos will stop making and selling cigarettes by 
the year 2000 
the rev michael crosby successed in getting a nocigarettes 
resolution introduced at the 1990 annual meeting of the maker of 
marlboros after two years of failed legal attempts 
shareholders will vote on the issue thursday during the new 
yorkbased food and tobacco companys annual meeting in richmond 
we know the cards are stacked against us said crosby who 
coordinates the interfaith center on corporate responsibility in 
new york 
not surprisingly management of the multibilliondollar company 
is urging stockholders to vote against the resolution which is 
included in philip morris proxy statement 
the cigarette business is the companys original core 
business it has been and remains an important and lawful 
business managements statement said 
it is a major contributor to the companys profitability 
the company said the board believes that the proposal is 
illconceived and would be highly detrimental to the company 
in 1989 179 billion or 39 percent of philip morris 448 
billion in revenue came from domestic and foreign tobacco 
operations the rest came from the companys interest in beer 
food real estate and financial services 
philip morris has moved away from tobacco and into other 
businesses with its purchases of kraft and general foods which 
together form the largest food company in the united states and 
canada 
philip morris which operates a cigarette factory in richmond 
has 11 percent of the world market for cigarettes its marlboro 
brand is the worlds bestselling consumer packaged product 
crosbys proposal is not the only antismoking shareholder issue 
before tobacco companies this year 
american brands inc for example faces a similar measure that 
would force the old greenwich conn company to get out of the 
tobacco business 
crosbys proposal also is not the only one attacking philip 
morris and its tobacco business another is aimed at preventing the 
sale of cigarettes to children or the promotion of them for 
children 
the evangelical lutheran church in america secured that item on 
the agenda and philip morris management also opposes it 
the purpose of the companys cigarette advertising and 
promotional activities is to persuade smokers to purchase our 
brands rather than those marketed by our competitors the company 
said in its proxy these activities are not directed to minors 
nor are they intended to induce anyone to smoke 
while the proposals are unlikely to succeed they are designed 
to draw attention to health problems associated with smoking said 
crosby who will get five minutes during the meeting to discuss his 
measure 
crosby hopes to get at least 3 percent of the about 9256 
million outstanding shares on a smokefree philip morris under 
federal rules that would get the issue on next years ballot 
without a legal fight
