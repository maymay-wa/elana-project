palestinian the united states wants extradited in connection with 
the bombing of an american airliner a member of parliament says

palestinian mohammed rashid wanted by the united sates for 
allegedly planting a bomb that exploded in a pan am airliner flying 
over hawaii in 1982 a japanese teenager was killed by the blast 
and 15 other passengers were wounded 
the rashid affair has become a sensitive issue between greece

hungarys prime minister josef antall 
says soviet compensation demands for withdrawing troops from his 
country are unreasonable 
antall on friday also threatened that hungary would leave the 
sovietled warsaw pact if it remained a military organization 
we want to abolish the military structure of the warsaw pact 
if this doesnt happen we will leave it by the end of next year 
antall said in an interview broadcast on finnish national radio 
antall said the soviet union demanded over 4 million for 
facilities and equipment left behind by 50000 soviet soldiers who 
have begun withdrawing from hungary which elected a noncommunist 
government in march 
we think these demands are unreasonable as they the soldiers 
have used old hungarian buildings damaged them and polluted the 
environment said antall in helsinki for a meeting of 
conservative european leaders

the detention of swedes in iraq has 
revived the debate over stockholms traditional policy of 
neutrality some swedes angry after seeing their captive 
countrymen on tv are demanding military action 
a few young men have even called the us embassy in stockholm 
volunteering to join international forces blockading iraq other 
swedes suggest their country contribute forces to the military 
buildup in the persian gulf 
successive swedish governments have argued in favor of 
neutrality allowing the country to play a mediating role in some 
conflicts 
it has also protected swedes often citizens of neutral 
countries have been allowed to leave hot spots while other 
nationalities are detained 
pehr g gyllenhammar head of the volvo car manufacturing 
empire is one of those calling for a reevaluation of the politics 
of neutrality 
the iraqi invasion of kuwait has shown a new unity between 
countries which earlier were in conflict with each other he 
wrote in the dagens nyheter newspaper 
in this situation sweden passes as usual as usual we refer 
to our policy of neutrality he said as usual we indicate a 
special role of mediator which has influenced iraqi president 
saddam husseins decision to release swedes while holding as 
hostages the citizens of nations which protest and are willing to 
take risks 
iraq has seemed to take neutrality into account in its treatment 
of foreigners when saddam said wednesday that western women and 
children would be allowed to leave finns were the first to go 
in addition groups of finns swedes and austrians were released 
from iraq last week while most other westerners remained captive 
but the exodus was suddenly stopped more than 100 swedes many 
male employees of swedish firms were being held in iraq 
foreign ministry spokeswoman anita matejovsky said some of about 
50 swedish women and children in iraq received exit visas friday 
and that the rest were promised theirs on saturday she said 
government officials say swedes have been held because the 
country supports un sanctions against iraq they reject 
suggestions that their policy toward saddam is milder than that of 
other western nations 
we are not neutral in this crisis prime minister ingvar 
carlsson said tuesday 
finland and sweden say they like other nations are refusing to 
close their embassies in occupied kuwait as iraq has demanded but 
the embassy buildings have actually been emptied 
carlsson endured tough questioning on the subject during a 
nationally televised news conference tuesday he was asked whether 
87 million in aid to persian gulf refugees was intended as 
compensation for the absence of swedish military help 
journalists also asked whether sweden was not acting sharply 
against iraq because it still hoped to get its citizens out 
we have acted sharply already we are not proceeding mildly in 
this question said carlsson barely containing his anger 
but he said sweden would not send military forces unless the 
united nations specifically requests them 
sweden which has not fought a war in 176 years has contributed 
more than 55000 men to un peacekeeping operations 
swedes have been debating the ramifications of their neutrality 
policy since world war ii at that time nazi troops were allowed 
to cross swedish territory into occupied norway but allied forces 
were not given access to help finland in its winter war with the 
soviet union 
independenceminded lithuanians estonians and latvians are 
still bitter about swedens acceptance of the soviet unions 
annexation of the baltic states in 1940 lithuanian president 
vytautas landsbergis on a trip through nordic countries during the 
past week has been comparing iraqs annexation of kuwait to his 
countrys fate 
in one appearance he asked whether sweden in the name of 
realist politics would be willing to hand kuwait to iraq after a 
year of annexation 
because of todays international situation of eastwest 
detente there is a tendency to question the dogma of 
neutrality said wilhelm agrell an associate professor of peace 
and conflict studies at the university of lund 
the iraq crisis tests a new international position for sweden 
and also for many other countries said agrell sweden has 
answered with confusion and delay and crouches down behind the fact 
that it is a small country

homesick and heartsick over the iraqi invasion of their country 
stranded kuwaiti students are doing more worrying than studying 
and some have dropped out to join the fight 
studying comes second now said osamah altuwairesh one of 
14 kuwaiti students at the university of southern california last 
semester the first thing we think about is getting our country 
back 
students and other kuwaiti nationals began gathering in 
washington dc on friday for a conference to discuss their 
countrys situation the meeting expected to draw up to 1500 
people ends on sunday 
ever since the first day of august all my friends have talked 
about going back and joining the resistance said altuwairesh 
president of the 110member southern california branch of the 
national union of kuwaiti students he said he knows at least a 
dozen students who have traveled to saudi arabia since the invasion 
the first day this happened some students started collecting 
names of people saying they were ready to go said abdulhamid 
khudada a graduate architectural engineering student at penn 
state thats the least we could do its not fair the americans 
and others go to fight for our country and we dont fight 
the kuwaiti embassy has tried to encourage the more than 1200 
students at us universities and colleges to stay in school 
despite possible financial hardships caused by a cutoff of funds 
from their oilrich government which had supplied many with 
scholarships and living stipends 
they dont want people just to back there and get killed 
altuwairesh said the students really dont have any military 
training 
the embassy is working on ways to pay the students bills and 
many schools have agreed to defer tuition dormitory and book costs 
for the moment others are offering loans and helping the kuwaitis 
find jobs the immigration and naturalization service is allowing 
them to work 20 hours a week during the crisis 
the university did everything possible to help said 
univeristy of new mexico architecture student jamal alhajji 
they told me if you want a job in school we can arrange it for 
you and they can give me a loan 
central michigan university also has agreed to defer payments 
for its 15 kuwaiti students said sharon george director of the 
international student services in return the kuwaiti students 
are very very thankful she said they are a gracious people 
and a proud country they are not used to being cared for 
saif abdullah of the kuwaiti embassy in washington said they are 
collecting donations and have reduced the usual stipends by about 
40 percent the students will go through some hardship until 
everything is ok he said 
but financial worries pale next to family ones many students 
have not heard from relatives since the aug 2 invasion 
im so worried said saud abdullaziz a senior at the 
university of san francisco who last spoke to his parents and 
brother in kuwait city the day before the iraqis moved in im 
thinkng of canceling this semester and going back to check on my 
family i am just thinking all the time about home 
anwar almudhat a doctoral candidate in finance and investment 
at claremont graduate school said his fellow students can do more 
for their country by staying here than by returning home 
its a noble thing to do but most of these people arent 
trained almudhat said besides we need these people here in 
the united states to present our peoples case to case to the 
american public and this by itself is a noble thing

when the airmen yelled go get em 
genrul h norman schwarzkopf couldnt resist 
well get em all right he said then he turned quickly to 
correct himself mindful of his mission and the group of reporters 
trailing him 
were going to get them when they come across the border 
said the commander of the us forces marshalling in saudi arabia 
south of the border with iraqioccupied kuwait 
schwarzkopf who set up his command post in saudi arabia just 
days ago paid his first visit to the troops in the field friday 
his nickname is bear and he can be blunt and gruff but on 
friday he tried a more grandfatherly approach putting his arm 
around troops and commanders alike 
he assured them of the worlds support and promised to make 
their stay in the desert as comfortable as possible as they face 
off against the iraqis who invaded kuwait on aug 2 
he had a simple message to the troops 
our job is to get it over as fast as we can he told a group 
of airmen 
after air force a10 pilots told him their tankkilling jets 
could exact a heavy toll on the iraqi armored divisions 
schwarzkopf nooded in approval before fighting goodnaturedly for 
his branch of the service 
try and leave a few for the army will you he quipped as he 
left 
schwarzkopf spoke softly when telling a group of marines about 
the crash of one of the huge c5 galaxy transports in west germany 
on wednesday in the operation desert shield airlift thirteen of 
the 17 americans aboard were killed 
he can shift gears quickly 
at the news conference he was asked if the united states was 
getting military help from israel the enemy of the arab world 
no was the answer next question 
he said he wasnt worried about us troops adjusting to the 
desert climate where temperatures can shoot up to 120 degrees 
theyre not potted plants or greenhouse shrubs he chided 
for iraqi forces schwarzkopf had nothing but bad wishes but he 
delivered them in an animated exchange with reporters 
i hope theyre hungry and i hope theyre thirsty and i hope 
theyre out of ammo he said and i hope they feel bad about 
what they did because they should

japans reaction to the persian gulf crisis reveals 
a nation still not ready to take on the responsibilities of global 
leadership despite its status as an economic superpower 
prime minister toshiki kaifu announced wednesday nearly one 
month after the iraqi invasion of kuwait an aid package of nearly 
1 billion for the usled force arrayed against iraq and further 
assistance to middle east countries hurt by the embargo on baghdad 
robert orr director of the stanford japan center in kyoto says 
japans policy formulation was largely a matter of deciding what 
could be done to placate washington 
i dont think thats the way a great power should be 
operating orr said friday the japanese still really do not 
have a global perspective 
japanese bureaucrats can expect further pressure from the united 
states which had applauded the package as an initial contribution 
to the gulf forces washington has urged tokyo to provide 
transportation for military cargo 
the iraqi invasion of kuwait on aug 2 has shown that the 
japanese political system is illequipped to cope with the quick 
decisionmaking required in responding to international crises 
bureaucratic infighting between powerful ministries has made it 
difficult to reach a consensus a cherished goal of political life 
here 
in effect they were arguing when they should have taken 
action the japan times newspaper said in an editorial 
and kaifu despite strong showings in public opinion polls does 
not have the power base within the governing liberal democratic 
party to easily push through his own agenda 
throughout the process of determining its contribution to the 
middle east japan has never made clear what its basic policy 
is the newspaper mainichi shimbun wrote friday 
kaifu has acknowledged the countrys growing responsibility 
in the world and awareness of growing impatience with the pace of 
tokyos response 
if our response was delayed any further i was afraid we would 
give the impression to the world that japan is not doing anything 
about this serious problem he said after unveiling the package 
behind the weeks of waiting for a japanese aid program to emerge 
was a heated debate over what could be done under the postworld 
war ii constitution that bars the use of force in settling 
international disputes 
there is strong public opinion in japan and throughout asia 
against any action that could lead to japanese military activity 
overseas 
triggered by the us pressure bureaucrats and politicians are 
debating a change of the countrys laws that would make it easier 
for japan to respond to future crises in a decisive matter but 
which critics charge could led to a violation of the constitution 
a government official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the legal review was unprecedented and indicates that japans 
reaction to the middle east tension is charting new ground for the 
country 
any proposed revisions are sure to meet with strong opposition 
in the parliament where the japan socialist party is the largest 
opposition group 
a senior socialist recently said of the crisis it is an ideal 
time for japan to show the spirit of our peace constitution

bank customers beginning today will be 
guaranteed quicker access to their deposits under the final 
installment of a 3yearold federal law that the banking industry 
is trying to get changed 
at issue is the expected funds availability act legislation 
passed by congress in 1987 to prevent banks from imposing lengthy 
delays before customers were allowed access to deposited funds 
beginning sept 1 banks will be required to meet shorter time 
limits for making funds available on deposited checks 
local checks must be cleared by the bank in two business days 
down from three days currently nonlocal checks must be cleared in 
five business days down from the current seven business days 
a local check is defined as one written on an institution in the 
same metropolitan area or within the same federal reserve check 
processing region 
the previous threeday and sevenday limits had been in effect 
for the past two years and were instituted as interim standards to 
give banks time to prepare for the more stringent final regulations 
many banks are already processing checks in the shorter time 
periods going into effect today those banks that have been using 
the longer interim standards will be required to notify their 
customers within the next 30 days that their funds will be 
available more quickly 
in addition to the changes affecting regular checks money 
deposited in the form of cashiers checks certified checks and 
government checks must be available to depositors by 9 am the 
next business day this represents no change from the interim 
regulations 
the law guaranteeing bank customers quicker access to their 
money was passed after a long lobbying campaign in which consumer 
groups presented examples of banks freezing funds for as long as 
two or three weeks a practice banks referred to as putting a 
hold on deposited checks 
the us public interest research group which lobbied 
aggressively for the 1987 law said banks were making 290 million 
annually in interest on the money withheld from customers during 
the socalled float period the time between when the bank got 
credit for the funds and when it released the money for use by the 
depositor 
the consumer research group charged that banks were collecting 
another 145 million a year in bouncedcheck fees because funds 
werent released faster for depositors use 
in the two years in which the interim regulations have been in 
effect consumer groups contend the law has allowed depositors with 
interestbearing accounts to make millions of dollars more because 
of the shorter hold periods on checks 
we think the law is working well to make the holdup at the 
bank a thing of the past said ed mierzwinski consumer advocate 
at the us public interest research group 
however banking groups have been lobbying congress to make 
changes in the law a bill giving banks more leeway was approved by 
the senate banking committee in july 
under that measure which is expected to be taken up by the full 
senate in september banks for the next four years would be given a 
longer processing time for certain checks deposited at automated 
teller machines 
mark serepca a spokesman for the american bankers association 
said a recent survey by his organization found that 20 percent of 
banks will just stop accepting deposits at teller machines unless 
the customer has an account at the bank whose teller machine he is 
using 
many banks are telling us they wont offer the expanded 
service any more because they fear the risk of too many bad 
checks serepca said 
while consumer groups said they would be willing to accept 
longer processing time for certain automated teller deposits they 
vowed to fight another proposal that would keep the processing time 
for all local checks at three days instead of the twoday limit 
taking effect today 
mierzwinski said such a change isnt necessary because surveys 
done by the federal reserve which administers the law showed that 
up to 75 percent of banks are already processing local checks 
without difficulties within the twoday limit

president bush calls it the shape of the 
postpostwar world to a degree unknown for generations the 
nations of the world are working together in the interest of peace 
not only in the persian gulf but in bloodstained cambodia as well 
gone at least for the moment are the superpower rivalries that 
often blocked cooperation to settle regional conflicts during the 
post world war ii era that came to be tagged the cold war 
but the new world bush talks about is sure to contain its own 
chills and frustrations for the united states for example a world 
in which international cooperation is the norm is one in which 
unilateral action is condemned 
how much has the world changed in the nine months since bushs 
unilateral decision to remove manuel antonio noriega from power in 
panama 
or since ronald reagans decision to invade grenada or leonid 
brezhnevs decision to send soviet troops into afghanistan 
does the swift mobilizing of an international force to block 
saddam hussein give reason to think prospects are heightened for an 
international effort to finally bring peace to the middle east 
what is at stake here is truly significant bush said 
thursday he cited the dependability of americas commitments to 
its friends and allies the shape of the postpostwar world 
opposition to aggression the potential domination of the energy 
resources that are crucial to the entire world 
he spoke in the context of announcing that he was asking japan 
west germany korea saudi arabia the united arab emirates and 
free kuwait for financial and energy resources to support the 
persian gulf mobilization 
that request opens another area of international involvement 
presumably nations that agree to pay part of the cost will also 
want a role in the decision making 
at this time of widespread agreement on how to proceed in 
response to the iraqi aggression that wouldnt seem much of a 
problem but suppose saddam hussein is able to hold out resist the 
blockade and keep his troops in kuwait indefinitely will the 
worlds unanimity continue 
should iraq yield to international pressure and withdraw from 
kuwait will there be unanimity on the shape of the postinvasion 
persian gulf would a return to the status quo a kuwait governed 
by the emir and his family be acceptable to all nations 
there also is the question of whether an iraqi withdrawal would 
now be enough influential members of congress such as sen 
richard lugar rind a senior member of the senate foreign 
relations committee are urging bush to hold out for the removal of 
saddam hussein from power they argue that as long as he is in 
control of iraq it would only be a matter of time before he struck 
again 
more broadly any attempt to look ahead to the postcold war 
world runs into the question of whether the response to iraqs 
invasion of kuwait will be the exception or the rule 
after all the persian gulf with its oil resources is a region 
so vital to so many of the worlds industrial nations that it 
provided unique incentive for governments to set aside interests 
that divide them and unite behind an effort to roll back the iraqi 
aggression 
less than 24 hours after bush cited with obvious satisfaction 
the number of nations cooperating with the us in the persian 
gulf the vietnameseinstalled government of cambodia announced its 
willingness to accept a major un role in moving that nation 
toward free elections 
while the announcement leaves cambodia still a long way from an 
end to a 20year period in which hundreds of thousands of people 
have died it does represent substantial progress toward an 
international solution 
for years the world stood by apparently helpless as cambodia 
was ravaged by civil war and the savagery of the khmer rouge regime 
when thousands died in execution chambers and slave labor camps 
the prospect of a return to power of the khmer rouge may have 
provided enough incentive for the compromise that is leading to a 
united nations role 
the persian gulf and cambodia both areas on which it was 
relatively easy to find international agreement on the need for 
action to halt further violence 
the leaders who now are cooperating need only look back on the 
response to the start of the iraniraq war to see a different sort 
of response there was no concerted effort to halt the fighting 
between two evenly matched nations widely viewed as pariahs the 
only concern during the years that war dragged on was over whether 
it would cause an interruption of oil shipments

the idea of a floating hospital for injured 
seals and sea lions seemed like a good one to dan deuel and mary 
crumley but it smacked of harboring the enemy to some people who 
have made death threats against the couple 
man is pretty possessive said neal langbehn a national 
marine fisheries service special agent whose job includes tracking 
down people who shoot marine mammals if a critter causes him any 
problems all his natural instinct seems to be to get rid of the 
critter as man takes up more and more of the earth there are 
going to be more conflicts 
deuel and crumley and some volunteers run free flight bird and 
marine mammal rehabilitation ltd from their home on a bluff 
overlooking the pacific ocean 
earlier this year deuel suggested to the bandon port commission 
that he could move his operation to a barge in the harbor that 
would make it more accessible to the public and more mobile in case 
of an oil spill 
the commission said ok but the reaction from some nameless 
people was different 
my old man says you will be so ticked off when that mary gets 
dead just like our fish no barge or shes dead read one 
letter 
the mans voice on the telephone answering machine was choked 
with anger bring one sea lion into the port of bandon and ill 
kill him right along with you buddy 
the threats have been turned over to the oregon state police 
which called in the fbi to help 
they sound maybe crazy enough to do it crumley said 
if we get a death threat here we feel it is not just a death 
threat towards us said deuel it is a death threat against 
anyone who cares about peace on this planet 
free flight which deuel started 13 years ago is caring for an 
orphaned steller sea lion pup and three injured harbor seal pups 
one was shot one was attacked by a dog and one was hit by rocks 
thrown by children 
because of the hostility i dont release any of them around 
certain coastal communities deuel said 
the law allows fishermen to shoot harbor seals and california 
sea lions if they steal fish and wont be driven away but not 
steller sea lions they were listed this year as a threatened 
species because of dwindling numbers in alaskan waters 
though their population is stable in oregon a fisherman who 
shoots one here is still liable for a 25000 federal fine 
theres an awful lot of hard feelings on the entire coast 
from california clear up to alaska about the seals and sea lions 
and their predation onto salmon said melvin erdman who has 
fished out of bandon for 48 years 
when a sea lion comes across a salmon troller it will dog the 
boat for hours taking the fish right off the hook as the fisherman 
winches it in 
bitterness runs deep among fishermen who have watched the 
government cut and complicate the salmon season to conserve 
dwindling stocks then protect a predator 
erdman said there is no shortage of people who would happily 
kill the seals and sea lions deuel and crumley care for though he 
hasnt heard anyone threaten the couple directly 
despite the threats deuel said he wont give up on his project 
it is all dependent on how our fund raising goes and right now 
it is not going too bad he said

frontseat passengers of the 1990 chrysler 
lebaron are nearly seven times more vulnerable to head injury in 
crashes than the cars drivers who are protected by air bags 
government tests show 
a chrysler spokesman however said the tests were unreliable 
because they were based on conditions that exceed government safety 
standards 
the national highway traffic safety administration on friday 
released its final round of crash test results for 1990 
automobiles for the year the agency tested 34 vehicles ranging 
from subcompacts to luxury sedans and light trucks 
the tests showed that most drivers protected by air bags were 
significantly less likely to sustain head injury than unprotected 
frontseat passengers in the same vehicles 
in the chrysler imperial fourdoor sedan for example the 
passenger is four times as vulnerable as the driver 
chrysler spokesman steve harris said the tests were based on 
crashes of cars into fixed objects at 35 miles per hour but 
government regulations require only that vehicles have safety belts 
or air bags that perform satisfactorily in tests conducted at 30 
mph 
also the tests were not repeated to ensure that initial results 
were free from external factors such as the weather or equipment 
failure he said 
but harris acknowledged air bags have a major impact on safety 
and are needed for passengers as well as drivers 
everybody in the auto industry has indicated thats the 
direction theyre going he said well be moving air bags into 
the minivans next year and start working toward passenger air bags 
shortly thereafter 
the nhtsa tests under the same conditions as a frontal 
collision between two identical vehicles driving at 35 mph are 
equivalent to a car moving at 70 mph striking an identical parked 
car 
tests are conducted using dummies that represent an 
averagesized adult male the dummies wear seat belts 
according to the nhtsa index a score of 750 or lower means head 
injury is unlikely 7501250 means head injury is possible and 
anything higher means head injury is likely 
a separate scale records the possibility of chest injury which 
is considered likely when the score tops 60 
the lower the numbers the lower the potential for injury but 
for purposes of comparison vehicles have to be of the same type 
and weigh within 500 pounds of each other 
the chrysler lebarons score for driver head injury was 298 
well below the threshold for likely injury but the frontseat 
passenger score was 2043 chest injury scores were 40 for the 
driver and 46 for the passenger 
in the imperial the driver head injury score was 517 while the 
passenger head injury score was 2132 
rated highest of all vehicles tested for potential driver head 
injury was the ford club wagon van with a score of 2613 its 
passenger score was 1896 
the isuzu trooper ii had the highest potential injury score for 
the frontseat passenger 1952 
the chevrolet s10 blazer had the highest driver chest injury 
score 74 the highest passenger injury score was the trooper iis 
64

a doctor convicted of an identityswitch 
murder in an insurance fraud case will be retried after jurors 
deadlocked on whether he should be sent to the gas chamber 
prosecutors said 
a judge on friday allowed a new penalty phase trial for dr 
richard pryde boggs and scheduled a sept 13 hearing to set the 
trial date 
boggs 57 was convicted july 12 of murder grand theft assault 
and insurance fraud on aug 8 the jury deadlocked 102 in favor 
of sending him to the gas chamber for the 1988 death of ellis henry 
greene 
boggs was silent on friday as deputy district attorney al 
mackenzie asked the judge for a retrial on the penalty phase an 
effort defense attorney dale rubin termed a waste of taxpayers 
money 
no jury would condemn boggs to death on the strength of the 
evidence presented at trial rubin told superior court judge 
florence marie cooper 
it is not in the furtherance of justice to retry this case 
said rubin but cooper ruled the law gives her no such discretion 
i believe the decision lies with the prosecution authority not 
the court she said 
the prosecution said boggs lured greene from a north hollywood 
bar to his medical office in april 1988 and suffocated him 
although the cause of death was never conclusively proved through 
medical evidence 
the prosecution alleged that boggs and the owners of the 
troubled just sweats sports apparel company of ohio conspired to 
switch greenes identity in an effort to collect life insurance on 
one of the business partners 
melvin e hanson principal in the clothing firm awaits trial 
in the case his partner john b hawkins remains a fugitive 
boggs misidentified the body as hanson and hawkins had the body 
cremated the following day hansons credit cards and birth 
certificate were found with the body 
hawkins who is still missing received 1 million in life 
insurance benefits and boggs got 6500 prosecutors said 
rubin acknowledged at trial that boggs participated in an 
insurance fraud scheme but said his client never killed anyone 
he said boggs conviction was influenced by testimony about his 
homosexual lifestyle and suggested that would be an issue on appeal 
of his conviction boggs wore bright orange jail coveralls to 
court indicating he is being held in the los angeles county jails

a report on how to save the rare spotted owl 
is not on the presidents desk as planned today and at least one 
scientist says advice offered on this issue should be made public 
anyway 
the report is being prepared by a task force chaired by two 
cabinet secretaries clayton yeutter of agriculture and manuel 
lujan jr of interior 
at stake is the survival of the endangered owl and the financial 
health of the northwest timber industry which environmentalists 
say is contributing to the birds problems 
officials for the agriculture department refused official 
comment on friday but a department official who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity said the task force has not come back 
with a finding yet 
the sept 1 deadline was an internal goal they are looking at 
next week the source said 
officials for the fish and wildlife service also refused comment 
on the task force this week david klinger press officer for the 
services regional office in portland said the service is not 
privy to the task force meetings 
its going to be news to us right along with the rest of the 
world he said 
white house spokesman stephen hart said in a telephone interview 
from kennebunkport maine that it was not yet decided what role 
bush will play in the final decision about protecting the owl on 
federal lands 
its unclear in that we are not sure what form the report will 
take we are right now in a waiting mode to see what the task force 
delivers i would expect any final decision will have to have the 
concurrence of the white house he said 
what we have said in the past is that we are seeking a 
balance hart said 
meanwhile a scientist who appeared before the task force in 
august is urging its leaders to make public the advice they have 
received from independent biologists and foresters 
the scientist former texas aampm biologist john teer was among 
three who said this week that they endorsed a protection plan that 
the white house has resisted 
teer said they told assistant agriculture secretary james 
moseley the owls survival would be jeopardized by any further 
compromise in the plan submitted by forest service biologist jack 
ward thomas and a committee of government scientists 
i think it would be to his advantage to let people know 
teer said 
the administration has struggled to please both 
environmentalists and the northwests timber industry since the 
thomas panel determined in april that the rare bird is headed for 
extinction unless logging stops on millions of acres of oldgrowth 
forests 
the fish and wildlife service declared the owl a threatened 
species on june 22 but the listings impact remains unclear with a 
government blueprint for protection still in limbo 
environmentalists say the republican administration is ignoring 
the advice of its own scientists while bending owl protection plans 
to lessen the impact on timber jobs

new druguse statistics confirm earlier 
surveys that indicate cocaine use is declining according to 
officials at the national institute on drug abuse 
the new data show a continued drop in the number of 
cocainerelated emergency room visits in hospitals across the 
country 27 percent from the third quarter of 1989 through the 
first quarter of this year 
we are finally beginning to see some progress in reaching 
those who are seriously affected by the cocaine epidemic said 
charles schuster director of the institute which is in the 
department of health and human services 
the figures from the drug abuse warning network or dawn show 
the number of visits for the first quarter of this year was 8135 
a 4 percent reduction from the last quarter of 1989 when 8507 
visits were recorded visits in the third quarter of 1989 numbered 
11145 
despite the improvement however the number of cocainerelated 
deaths continued to increase last year to 2496 up from 2254 in 
1988 dawn reports death data only on an annual basis 
were assuming deaths occur most often among the heaviest 
users and thats the population youd expect to see changes in 
last said edgar adams director of epidemiology at the institute 
were just beginning to see change in the emergencyroom data 
and if that continues we would hope to see a downturn in the 
deaths next he said 
heroin use followed the same trend as cocaine both for hospital 
visits and for deaths 
the dawn data shows the number of emergency room visits related 
to the drug dropped 22 percent from 3933 in the third quarter of 
1989 to 3071 in the first quarter of this year 
heroinrelated deaths however climbed from 1884 in 1988 to 
1995 in 1989 
significant decreases in cocaine and heroinrelated emergency 
room visits were reported by hospitals in most of the cities 
included in the dawn report officials said 
they said this confirms decreases in drug use reflected in two 
other surveys conducted by the institute the national household 
survey on drug abuse and the high school senior survey 
the decrease in cocainerelated emergency room visits began in 
september of last year after three quarters of holding steady and 
increasing 354 percent between the second quarter of 1985 and the 
last quarter of 1988 
adams said the pattern indicates that the downturn is not an 
aberration 
its important that were looking at a period that extends 
through several quarters where there was a period of stability and 
six months of decreases adams said 
the dawn data is based on reports from 431 emergency rooms most 
of the facilities are located in 21 large metropolitan areas

neil bush says hes no longer in a position to 
do the things banking regulators have accused him of doing and 
hes asking an administrative law judge to dismiss the governments 
case against him 
the presidents son was an outside director of silverado 
banking savings and loan association a denver thrift that 
collapsed in december 1988 at a cost to taxpayers estimated at 1 
billion regulators have accused bush 35 of conflict of interest 
in his former role as a director 
in written arguments submitted to judge daniel j davidson bush 
said there was no possibility that he could continue the alleged 
abuses since silverado already has been taken over by the 
government 
silverado is in receivership said his brief which was made 
available friday no intermediate step taken now will prevent 
that and nothing bush could ever do in the future could pose 
abnormal risk loss or damage to silverado or its insured 
deposits 
in a separate sampl development friday a spokeswoman for the 
resolution trust corp said that agency plans to hire a special 
group of employees to watch for possible corruption as it sells 
hundreds of failed thrifts 
the rtc hopes to set up a team of 20 to 30 contractor cops 
this fall spokeswoman kate spears said the team which will 
oversee the sale of billions of dollars of sampl assets will be led 
by a new assistant director of the rtc to be named soon 
the office of thrift supervision has accused bush of conflict of 
interest for not disclosing his business ties to two big silverado 
borrowers kenneth m good and bill l walters the thrift agency 
is seeking an order against bush which effectively would bar him 
from working for banks or sampls 
bush also could be a target of a negligence lawsuit that the 
federal deposit insurance corp is considering filing against him 
and other former directors of silverado 
bush has denied any wrongdoing and has insisted that the 
regulators actions are politically motivated he has been ordered 
to appear at a public hearing on sept 25 in denver before 
davidson who will then make a recommendation to the director of 
the office of thrift supervision timothy ryan 
a spokesman for the office william fulwider said friday the 
agency would have no comment on bushs request to the judge 
theres no authority for them the regulators to be doing 
what theyre doing bushs attorney james nesland said in a 
telephone interview from denver why should we litigate an order 
that cant be issued 
bushs petition says the proposed order against him would be the 
first against an outside director after the institution has been 
closed 
plainly the ceaseanddesist proceeding against bush cannot 
be characterized as an intermediate sanction to protect silverado 
or its insured funds the document says the action here can 
only be characterized as a punitive proceeding and that is not the 
purpose of a ceaseanddesist proceeding

jesse jackson who met this week with iraqi 
president saddam hussein on the persian gulf crisis has traveled 
the world as a selfappointed diplomat to pursue a host of missions 
of his own making 
the longtime civil rights activist and unsuccessful presidential 
candidate has visited dozens of countries and conferred with more 
than 60 heads of state 
one of jacksons biggest coups came in 1984 when he went to 
syria to secure the release of navy lt robert o goodman jr 
whose jet bomber was shot down during a raid over syrian 
antiaircraft positions in lebanons central mountains 
jackson who at the time was running for the democratic 
presidential nomination brought goodman home to the united states 
a month after the pilot was shot down jackson called on president 
reagan to meet personally with syrian president hafez assad to try 
to reduce tension between the two countries 
assads assistance to jackson was seen as a clever move to 
influence american public opinion to change reagans foreign policy 
in the region 
over the years jacksons efforts in international diplomacy 
have taken him around the globe and provoked controversy on more 
than one occasion 
he has hugged yasser arafat in lebanon accepted a cigar from 
fidel castro in cuba conferred with pope john paul ii in rome and 
advocated antiapartheid civil disobedience in south africa 
a photograph of jackson embracing arafat the leader of the 
palestine liberation organization during a 1979 visit to the 
middle east still angers many american jews and caused him trouble 
with jewish voters during his presidential campaigns at one point 
during the 1988 campaign jackson met with jewish leaders in what 
he described as an a step toward healing the wounds 
jackson said earlier this week he hoped to keep adversaries in 
the gulf talking in order to avoid war in the middle east but that 
he was making the trip as a journalist and would not be engaged in 
diplomatic negotiations 
jackson who flew to iraq for the us television show inside 
edition met thursday with saddam and iraqi foreign minister 
tariq aziz 
he met first with aziz who explained to him the reasons behind 
iraqs annexation of kuwait and later with saddam iraqi officials 
said no details of the meeting with saddam were released 
immediately 
jackson visited the persian gulf in 1987 meeting saudi arabian 
and jordanian leaders and delivering 600 pounds of christmas gifts 
for the crew of a us warship 
in 1984 jackson visited castro who then released some two 
dozen americans from his jails he also traveled to nicaragua 
where he praised the sandinista government to panama and to el 
salvador where he tried to mediate differences between salvadoran 
rebels and thenpresident napoleon duarte 
he paid his first visit to south africa in more than a decade in 
february when he met with black leader nelson mandela upon his 
release after 27 years in prison jackson had been refused a visa 
since 1979 
a year earlier he was in moscow to promote aid to victims of 
the december 1988 earthquake in armenia and to assess the economic 
and political reforms of mikhail gorbachev

when the tearful goodbye is over a navy 
wife is left to get on with life alone well almost alone 
the modern navy recognizing that reduced family worries make 
better sailors is offering counseling services or just a 
shoulder to cry on to families of troops shipped to the middle 
east 
you know the old quote the navy wife is the toughest job in 
the navy its true what it is to love a sailor is letting him 
go said a 36yearold navy wife with two teenage children who 
identified herself only by her first name glory 
in the past families turned to chaplains but in the late 
1970s the navy and marine corps started offering counseling 
services 
when i was in vietnam in the 60s who would have ever 
thought said william j kelly deputy director of the newport 
family service center which opened in 1982 newport has three 
counselors for its 8000 military personnel 
the defense departments decision to offer counseling is not 
all selfless kelly said troops perform better when they dont 
have to worry about their families at home he said 
to ease stress on those left stateside the military offers a 
variety of services the chaplains are still around and are more 
soughtout during times when troops are deployed said cmdr 
willard james a chaplain 
james said the five chaplains at the newport base often make 
referrals to the service center and to ombudsmen spouses of 
military personnel who are trained in crisis management and 
familiar with the various resources available 
glory is one of newports 35 ombudsmen telephone calls come 
around the clock she said 
i get the crying calls i get the happy calls i get the birth 
calls the 19year navy wife said i am a listening ear 
i think the hardest thing at this point is the uncertainty 
she said we dont have any answers for them 
the uss roberts is the only one of newports 12 ships to be 
deployed so far for those with family on the roberts the biggest 
concern has been ensuring paychecks arrive on time 
when the husband is deployed life goes on dinner has to get 
on the table she said we are the anchors

former president daniel ortega has 
told the conservative government it faces further social unrest 
unless it abandons its free market economic policies 
the leftist sandinista leader made the statement during a debate 
friday at the national university on the possible nicaragua 
among representatives of the new and old governments private 
enterprise and labor 
ortega succeeded by violeta barrios de chamorro in april after 
losing free elections said the only route to a truce between 
the sandinistas and the new government would be cancellation of 
three decrees that pave the way for the transition to a market 
economy 
president chamorros decrees were suspended after two violent 
sandinistaled strikes 
those decrees would have to be forgotten ortega said 
he accused the usbacked government of retaliating against 
the sandinistas by firing public servants planning to privatize 
state enterprises and planning to return sandinistaconfiscated 
lands to previous owners 
if this government takes destabilizing actions those 
governed have the right to question to protest the governments 
action to exercise their power which they do not lose when they 
cast their vote ortega said 
the sandinistas who promised to govern from below after 
losing the feb 25 elections maintain that any attempt to 
dismantle the leftist state they built is a destabilizing 
action 
attempts by the chamorro government to move to a market economy 
have provoked violent sandinista reaction including the two 
paralyzing strikes in may and july 
ortega insisted during the debate that workers have the right to 
strike for political reasons 
minister of the presidency antonio lacayo announced during the 
debate that the government has created a 10 million emergency fund 
to create shortterm jobs for those who become unemployed because 
of economic reforms 
the announcement by lacayo considered the real power in the 
4monthold government indicated how seriously nicaraguas 
leadership takes threats of more sandinistaled unrest 
the strikes have already put much of the new governments 
economic program on hold 
lacayo the presidents soninlaw rejected suggestions that 
the sandinistas have intimidated the government into sharing power 
he called for a constructive and cooperative attitude on all 
fronts to help rebuild nicaragua and said everyone must share the 
sacrifices needed to revive the economy 
ortega said the conditions for such cooperation do not exist 
those conditions are created by not firing teachers and 
public employees he said 
ortega said in the debate that 3000 sandinista sympathizers 
have been fired from government jobs and replaced with 2000 people 
who support the new government lacayo disputed those figures but 
did not offer any of his own 
unemployment is estimated at more than 30 percent about what 
it was under the sandinistas and is growing as the state tries to 
trim the public payroll 
inflation has been running at 80 percent a month since mrs 
chamorro took office on april 25 the price of staples is out of 
reach for many nicaraguans and foreign investment has been scared 
away by the sandinista labor unrest

an estimated 200000 children will be injured 
this year on the job according to a report by the american youth 
work center a youth advocacy group 
in a report released friday the american youth work center 
predicted some 40000 cases of child labor violations will be 
reported this year almost double the number found in 1989 
deaths and injuries are increasing dramatically and yet are 
spread thinly across the country said aywcs william treanor 
and so all that people have are anecdotal stories everybody can 
think of one gruesome horrible incident that theyre aware of and 
they think that thats some sort of freak occurrence 
the department of labor conducted a oneday sweep of businesses 
in june this year uncovering 3800 cases of child labor violation 
most of the cases involved youngsters working more hours than the 
laws allow but many were using dangerous machinery 
as a result of the sweep labor secretary elizabeth dole 
announced that the administration would back legislation to 
increase fines from 1000 to 10000 the maximum penalty for 
violations 
the legislation cosponsored by reps charles schumer dny 
and don pease dohio will go to the floor when congress gets back 
to work this fall

postal officials are redfaced about reports 
that they want americans to have a white christmas 
not so says richard j strasser senior assistant postmaster 
general for marketing and customer service strassers comments 
came after postal officials in kansas city told area residents 
earlier this week that they should never use red green or any 
dark colored envelopes 
if people buy christmas cards that come with envelopes that are 
red or green or some other color the postal service will deliver 
them happily strasser said friday 
americans send one another some 2 billion cards annually 
millions in colored envelopes 
white envelopes are easier for the agencys automated machinery 
to handle strasser admitted darkcolored backgrounds can make the 
addresses written on them very hard to read 
they are a challenge but we can handle it he said 
how did the misunderstanding start some postal workers may have 
been too enthusiastic in discussing the benefits of the new 
automatic letter sorting equipment strasser said 
strasser said the postal service and the makers of greeting 
cards have been working together to develop envelope colors that 
are attractive but can easily be handled by automatic sorting 
machinery 
but in the meantime no envelope that is sold will be rejected 
he said

health secretary louis sullivan is proposing 
to congress a plan that will change the way physicians are paid by 
the medicare program 
the package sent to congress on friday includes a preliminary 
fee schedule covering about 1400 physician services shifting 
payments to primary care and away from procedurebased services 
like surgery 
under the new system physician fees will be based on the time 
skill level and resources needed to perform the service as well as 
practice costs and malpractice insurance costs 
more than 500000 physicians will be affected by the change 
scheduled to be implemented jan 1 1992 it will be the largest 
change in the medicare program since its inception 25 years ago 
in his letter to health committee and subcommittee chairmen and 
ranking members sullivan cautioned that the numbers in the fee 
schedule are very preliminary many and perhaps all of these 
values will change 
important policy and technical questions are unresolved 
he said 
under the current medicare system physicians are paid their 
actual charge customary charge or the prevailing local charge for 
a service whichever is lowest 
the system has resulted in large variations in payments among 
localities and services 
the new system will pay physicians either the actual charge or a 
fee based on the value scale whichever is lower 
a geographic adjustment will account for differences in practice 
costs but overall payments will increase for many physicians in 
rural areas who are paid less than urban physicians under the 
current system 
a spokesman for the american medical association said the 
groups officials were looking over the preliminary fee schedule 
but could not comment in detail on the proposal yet

premier hau peitsun today proposed a 
one country two regions formula in another attempt to solve 
differences between taiwan and the rival communist government in 
china 
hau said the formula would respect the differing political 
systems of china and taiwan which has been governed by the 
nationalists since they lost a civil war on the chinese mainland in 
1949 
both the communists and nationalists regard taiwan as a chinese 
province 
hau said the nationalists would enact laws based on the new 
formula to govern trade cultural and other civilian exchanges 
between taiwan and china such exchanges have increased recently 
officials said one main area to be covered would be the 
repatriation of an increasing number of mainland chinese who have 
entered taiwan illegally to seek a better life at present there 
are no laws covering them 
more than 10000 mainlanders have entered taiwan illegally since 
1987 when the nationalists relaxed private contacts between 
taiwanese and chinese 
the nationalists who maintain they are chinas legitimate 
leaders continue to reject any official contacts with the chinese 
government 
in the past both sides have offered other formulas to solve 
their differences but each solution has been rejected by the other 
china proposed a one country two systems formula but this 
was rejected by the nationalists who said it would have reduced 
them to the status of a local government 
in turn the nationalists proposed a one country two 
governments formula but this was rejected by beijing which said 
it would have created two chinas 
hau proposed the latest formula in a written report to the 
lawmaking legislative yuan which would have to approve the 
changes there was no immediate indication of whether the proposal 
would be accepted 
legislator huang chuwen a member of the governing nationalist 
party said haus proposal was an attempt to resolve the dispute 
over sovereignty and solve problems involving trade and other 
private exchanges between taiwan and china

soviet prime minister nikolai ryzhkov 
joins other regional leaders sunday in trying to agree on a plan to 
save the polluted baltic sea but sovietbaltic independence 
politics was complicating the meeting 
onethird of the sea floor or about 40000 square miles is 
dead according to reports released by the baltic commission and 
greenpeace international in advance of the twoday conference in 
ronneby southern sweden 
phosphates and nitrates from farms factories and cars have 
created slimy algae floats along the coasts of the seven nations 
which surround the baltic sea according to the scientific reports 
sweden and poland are hosting the conference which has been 
overshadowed by the problem of how to invite representatives of 
five soviet republics without disavowing their struggle for 
independence or stepping on moscows toes 
invitations were finally sent last wednesday to the heads of 
governments in estonia latvia lithuania byelorussia and russia 
they are among soviet republics that have passed sovereignty 
declarations of various degrees 
they were given the right to make formal statements and display 
their flags at the conference but are to be regarded as part of 
the soviet delegation swedish officials said 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis declined the 
invitation friday saying it showed that sweden was a soviet 
satellite 
its a big pity that sweden in this situation has actually 
taken the position of the soviet union landsbergis said in oslo 
norway he said sweden was the only country in europe which 
accepted soviet annexation of lithuania latvia and estonia in 
1940 and its current policy reinforced that decision 
sweden takes a satellite position compared to czechoslovakia 
and hungary said landsbergis the events that are connected 
with the negotiations in ronneby stress the importance of what 
happened 50 years ago he said through an interpreter 
the international environmental organization greenpeace called 
on the conference to immediately start reducing pollution of the 
baltic it said nitrates and phosphates entering the sea have 
increased 10 times over the past 20 years producing the 
oxygenconsuming algal blooms 
greenpeace said a 1988 agreement by the baltic nations to halve 
all emissions into the sea by 1995 was far from adequate 
the baltic commission report said improvements have been made in 
some areas thanks to growing awareness during the 1970s and 1980s 
the report said levels of mercury lead arsenic ddt and other 
dangerous substances appeared to be falling 
swedish cabinet secretary pierre schori said friday his 
government sees the conference as an embryo for a regional 
cooperation which would include other issues as well for instance 
science culture and transportation questions 
he said i hope that we now shall see the first example of 
regional initiative in the new europe

the 265th quartermaster detachment of the south 
carolina national guard is one of the reserve units called up for 
possible duty in saudi arabia national writer fred bayles is 
following these 14 guardsmen as they prepare for deployment 
overseas to comply with security rules the mens last names are 
not used 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
napoleon said an army marches on its 
stomach but these days the 265th quartermaster detachment is 
treading a paperwork road on its way to the mideast 
theres recordkeeping to bind the tiny unit of 14 guardsmen 
over to the regular army forms for new dog tags forms for new 
green army identification cards to replace their red south carolina 
national guard ids forms to draw their first army pay 
more ominous is the business of preparing for overseas 
deployment the paperwork for inoculations against typhoid and 
meningitis fittings for new gas masks instructions to the army on 
where to send their belongings if they dont return 
im having them send my stuff to my mom and dad mark a 
20yearold college student said with an uncertain shrug 
but even these grim reminders of their mission are muted by the 
boredom that accompanies each stop 
some doze while waiting on the long wooden benches paying 
little attention to cnn news reports droning from the television 
suspended over the waiting area 
a general is telling reporters in saudi arabia the triple digit 
temperatures of the desert are dropping and us soldiers may be 
wearing field jackets on chilly nights but the men of the 265th 
arent listening as they go back out into the moist heat of georgia 
in august and on to their next stop 
the unit which specializes in water purification was put on 
alert last sunday a move that placed it in the regular army on 
wednesday the unit traveled from its hometown of allendale sc 
to this huge army base near savannah to begin training for 
deployment 
little was said friday through the heat and boredom about 
their eventual destination instead they razzed each other 
particularly mark the youngest member and the only white in the 
otherwise allblack unit 
you better watch it over there in the desert someone 
warned youre going to come home as dark as us 
a solution was suggested mark should wear his chemical warfare 
clothes at all time to avoid a sunburn 
another favorite joke marks decision to leave his prized red 
sports car with his girlfriend who quickly rolled up 600 new miles 
on the odometer 
hey dont worry about it said bill a veteran of 17 years 
in the guard if she put 600 miles on in two days you know she 
didnt have any time to fool around on you 
among those laughing was henry who retired in june after 25 
years of teaching at a gentlemanly 51 he is the oldest in the 
unit he was 34 when he joined and probably will stay until he has 
to leave when he turns 60 
i always wanted to be in the guard he said i couldnt 
for a long time because it was hard for blacks to get in 
limping slightly from the units predawn pt physical training 
henry had little hesitation about going to the mideast 
im glad to have the chance to pay the guard back he said 
henry coached football at ruffin high which fielded teams of 
dubious distinction henry said his players would pump themselves 
up with the odd chant i aint staying with my momma because she 
beats me i aint staying with my daddy cause he beats me im 
staying with ruffin because it dont beat no one 
members of the unit used to tease him about the team until this 
year when it beat allendale then said henry there was no 
mention of football 
thats what the guard is all about he said you work with 
the same people for years you work with people you know and can 
trust

rev jesse jackson the roughly 2000 americans left in the country 
are hiding from iraqi troops in fear of being used as hostages the 
new york times reported today 
an unknown number of americans have been rounded up and taken to 
iraq where they are being held at strategic sites as human shields 
against possible attack 
the diplomats who have been resisting an order from iraq to 
shut down the us embassy in kuwait city said they are running 
out of water their food is spoiling because they lack electricity 
and no airconditioning means they sleep outside for some relief 
from the heat the times reported 
i wouldnt say im terrified but it isnt a very pleasant 
way ambassador w nathaniel howell said friday through the 
locked gate of the embassy compound 
a group of reporters accompanied jackson into kuwait on an iraqi 
airways jet that president saddam hussein provided for him jackson 
traveled to the mideast in his new role as a television reporter 
and talked with saddam thursday night 
the western reporters were the first to be allowed into kuwait 
since the aug 2 invasion they were escorted through the quiet and 
nearly deserted city by armed iraqi escorts the newspaper said 
after hours of negotiations with iraqi officials jackson was 
allowed to visit the us embassy it said 
he spoke with howell and deputy chief of mission barbara badine 
who said americans trapped in iraq are staying out of sight 
theyre all in hiding because they know what the iraqis are 
going to do to them badine said theyre going to round them 
up in their houses they knock on the door at midnight and take 
people away we never hear from them again and they are interned 
for that reason they dont come out of their apartments to be 
seen 
jackson said he would appeal on their behalf in an interview 
with saddam scheduled for today he said he is videotaping news 
segments for broadcast next week 
diplomats said 11 americans in kuwait outside the compound 
needed medical treatment and asked that an evacuation flight be 
arranged 
they said they were with six colleagues in the compound and 42 
other americans who had sought refuge

a few foreigners began trickling out of 
iraq on friday under saddam husseins pledge to free women and 
children hostages but iraq made more requests in connection with 
the release of the remaining captives 
government spokesman naji alhadithi said 237 hostages were 
waiting to be flown to london and paris on iraqi airways he said 
on the return leg the flights should carry home iraqis who he said 
were stranded abroad 
this is a humanitarian request and we hope the two 
governments will reply quickly and positively alhadithi said at 
a news conference 
he referred to iraqis being stranded in london and paris by 
brutal american sanctions however the sanctions imposed 
against iraq by the united nations do not restrict the movement of 
iraqi nationals 
on saturday a senior official with iraqi airways said one of 
the airlines boeing 747s was scheduled later in the day to ferry 
scores of women and children out of the country 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said he did 
not have precise figures on passengers or a breakdown on 
nationality but said the plane would fly to amman jordan paris 
london and washington he said it would pick up iraqis stranded in 
europe 
britain did not object to letting the iraqi planes take iraqis 
home 
if a plane is coming out here with british nationals on it 
and is going back to empty to baghdad iraqi nationals want to go 
on it of course they can go a foreign office spokesman said 
adding pointedly we do not have hostages 
french foreign ministry spokesman daniel bernard said france had 
not been officially informed of the demands and added that france 
will not give ourselves over to any negotiations to any trading 
with anybody 
alhadithi said the request was not a precondition to allowing 
the foreign women and children to leave the country but if it were 
denied he said they might have to travel overland 
he said the foreign men still held in iraq are being held at 
potential military targets all over the country baghdad has 
already said the captives would be used a human shields for key 
installations 
every place every town that has a vital installation will 
host our guests alhadithi said iraq refers to the captives as 
guests 
were relocating the foreign men all over the country at 
airports air bases military bases industrial plants 
communications centers power centers and oil refineries wherever 
iraq considers it has a vital installation one exposed to the 
american threat in saudi arabia he said 
the united states has tens of thousands of troops deployed in 
saudi arabia along with contingents from other nations 
some 21000 westerners were stranded in kuwait and iraq after 
iraq invaded on aug 2 in a dispute over oil money and land 
on tuesday saddam announced he would allow the foreign women 
and children to leave to preserve the arabs humanitarian image 
among the first to depart were 19 italian women and children who 
crossed the desert and arrived in jordan on friday and three 
finnish women who crossed into turkey 
britains foreign office said friday that iraq has issued exit 
visas to 139 british women and children but hundreds of others 
were waiting for theirs 
the foreign ministry in bonn said it expected 100 of its 
nationals to be among the evacuees 
in stockholm foreign ministry spokeswoman anita matejovsky said 
some of about 50 swedish women and children in iraq received exit 
visas friday and that the rest were promised theirs on saturday 
she said two dozen other scandinavians were expected to be 
evacuated along with 16 spaniards five greeks and 17 cypriots 
the us state department had said that about onethird of the 
3000 americans trapped in kuwait and iraq are women and children 
who should be allowed out 
us state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said iraqi 
authorities rounded up five more americans she said one american 
woman was granted an exit visa and allowed to leave for jordan a 
us diplomat in baghdad said no american women and children had 
been granted exit permits by friday there was no explanation for 
the discrepancy 
the iraqis still have 100 percent control on the detainees 
said the diplomat who asked that his name was not used 
on thursday the state department criticized iraq for dragging 
its feet in releasing the american women and children 
a group of 316 soviets left for moscow friday aboard an aeroflot 
plane aeroflot is the only foreign airline that has been allowed 
to land in baghdad since the invasion 
a soviet official in baghdad said about 800 soviet civilians 
have been airlifted in recent days while hundreds of others 
traveled to jordan across the desert 
a senior asian diplomat complained about the confusion over the 
evacuation procedure 
its a very confusing situation one official says something

president mikhail s gorbachev said the government 
will choose from among four plans for major economic reform and 
will try to stabilize the faltering economy within six months 
and in an indication of the urgency he attaches to fixing the 
countrys economic woes gorbachev said he would cut back on 
foreign travel 
the soviet economy is wracked by shortages of everything from 
medicine to cigarettes and citizens are furious politicians are 
pushing for economic reforms of varying speed and scope 
four separate panels are currently working on widely different 
proposals to move the soviet economy from a centrally planned 
command system to one driven primarily by market forces 
but speaking to reporters after a twoday session of government 
advisory bodies gorbachev said officials believe the country 
should settle on one blueprint for major economic reform 
we must come out with one program gorbachev said if we 
lose two or three months it will affect things in such a way 
that we will have to make corrections not only in tactics but 
strategy 
the commissions include a group supervised by gorbachev and 
russian federation president boris n yeltsin who favors faster 
moves toward a market economy than gorbachev and kremlin leaders 
they went to work after the national legislature the supreme 
soviet rejected premier nikolai ryzhkovs blueprint for a 
transition to a market economy 
the supreme soviet reconvenes sept 10 to take up the latest 
proposals which gorbachev said would not be ready for another week 
yeltsin has said that if the central soviet governments plan is 
not to his liking he will implement radical and swift economic 
reform in russia the largest of the 15 soviet republics that 
would be a major blow to unity of the soviet union already 
fractured by bitter ethnic and political clashes 
but gorbachev said that at a joint meeting of the presidential 
and federation councils this week participants came to a general 
understanding of the situation its crucial nature and most 
importantly an understanding of the need to act together 
cooperating 
gorbachev is scheduled to visit france in the fall but appeared 
to rule out another trip he had been expected to make to spain in 
order to push along the nations economic reform 
the soviet president said serious measures would be taken in the 
next six months to cut off soviets ability to accumulate hot 
money the term for income derived from black marketeering and 
other activities 
the soviet union suffers from what economists call a ruble 
overhang a supply of rubles far outstripping the supply of goods 
available for purchase 
gorbachev did not say exactly how hot money would be 
controlled and did not specify what other steps were under 
consideration to stabilize the economy he said the next stage of 
economic reform would deal with prices taxes the governments 
budget and the earning distribution and use of foreign currency 
once the central government agrees on one of the reform plans 
he said it wil be presented to the legislatures of the soviet 
republics he acknowledged the proposals could face resistance 
everything is subjected to doubt to meticulous analysis 
gorbachev said 
he said the national legislature would also review the economic 
reform plan and that afterward he would issue a presidential decree 
confirming it 
ryzhkovs initial program presented in may called for drastic 
price increases on bread and other items whose prices have remained 
basically unchanged for decades the program fueled panic buying 
that made illstocked store shelves even barer

is the world ready for a pyramid version 
of rubiks cube or a toilettraining seat that encourages toddlers 
with flashing lights and a few bars of the hallelujah chorus 
inventors who hope it is are gathering at conventions in anaheim 
and pasadena this weekend showing off their products and dreaming 
of mass marketing and big profits 
an electric tooth flosser shared space with alaskan 
moosenugget flowers giftwrapped excretions and some 120 
other exhibits at the inventors amp entrepreneurs expo 1990 at the 
disneyland hotel in anaheim 
theres still this idea in america that youll have the 
opportunity to take a good idea and make millions said alan 
tratner president of the inventors workshop international the 
cosponsor of the trade show 
the small business administration is the other sponsor of the 
threeday expo 
this is like a lottery this is a gamble said joseph bland 
of santa barbara on opening day friday 
bland a thirdgeneration inventor whose grandfather created 
an early automatic transmission is displaying a valvedcell engine 
that he says can improve fuel economy by 200 percent 
the odds of a licensing agreement with a major auto firm are 
long he said but he might try marketing his design as an auto 
supply store kit he said he has spent 5000 over three years in 
legal fees to patent his design 
inventors are often a little nuts but must be tenacious 
too bland said 
i can have the greatest idea in the world but if i dont 
carry it through it will die he said 
fred roberts of clarksville tenn is confident there is a 
place in consumers hearts for his toilettraining seat 
with so many mothers working theres no mommies to potty 
train kids this motivates children and speeds training up 
roberts said 
the wooden seats decorated with the face of a dog teddy bear 
or other animal have an electronic microchip that allows parents 
to record words of encouragement for their child 
after a successful session the potty plays such tunes as 
raindrops keep falling on my head and the hallelujah 
chorus the animals lighted eyes flash and the wooden ears wag 
roberts said investors have put 1 million into his recently 
patented invention which he said was a hit when tested in daycare 
centers 
another anaheim exhibitor mike hodson traveled from wasilla 
alaska seeking exposure and a possible licensing agreement for a 
puzzle akin to a rubiks cube frustum is designed in a trendy 
new age pyramid shape 
at the invention convention in pasadena some 250 exhibitors are 
grouped by inventions to improve the planet improve human life 
and fad or fun creations said spokeswoman suzanne milstead 
a turtle pack which converts from a backpack to sleeping 
tent to chair is billed as a possible solution to the homeless 
problem another item being displayed is the miniflush which 
reduces the amount of water used in each flush of a toilet 
the threeday convention opening today is intended to connect 
inventors with companies or people interested in buying 
franchising or investing in new products she said 
but the independent tinkerer also plays an important social role 
the inventor may be the person who will help save our planet 
as it runs out of resources she said

jesse jackson who met this week with iraqi 
president saddam hussein on the persian gulf crisis has traveled 
the world as a selfappointed diplomat to pursue a host of missions 
of his own making 
the longtime civil rights activist and unsuccessful presidential 
candidate has visited dozens of countries and conferred with more 
than 60 heads of state 
one of jacksons biggest coups came in 1984 when he went to 
syria to secure the release of navy lt robert o goodman jr 
whose jet bomber was shot down during a raid over syrian 
antiaircraft positions in lebanons central mountains 
jackson who at the time was running for the democratic 
presidential nomination brought goodman home to the united states 
a month after the pilot was shot down jackson called on president 
reagan to meet personally with syrian president hafez assad to try 
to reduce tension between the two countries 
assads assistance to jackson was seen as a clever move to 
influence american public opinion to change reagans foreign policy 
in the region 
over the years jacksons efforts in international diplomacy 
have taken him around the globe and provoked controversy on more 
than one occasion 
he has hugged yasser arafat in lebanon accepted a cigar from 
fidel castro in cuba conferred with pope john paul ii in rome and 
advocated antiapartheid civil disobedience in south africa 
a photograph of jackson embracing arafat the leader of the 
palestine liberation organization during a 1979 visit to the 
middle east still angers many american jews and caused him trouble 
with jewish voters during his presidential campaigns at one point 
during the 1988 campaign jackson met with jewish leaders in what 
he described as an a step toward healing the wounds 
jackson said earlier this week he hoped to keep adversaries in 
the gulf talking in order to avoid war in the middle east but that 
he was making the trip as a journalist and would not be engaged in 
diplomatic negotiations 
jackson who flew to iraq for the us television show inside 
edition met thursday with saddam and iraqi foreign minister 
tariq aziz 
he met first with aziz who explained to him the reasons behind 
iraqs annexation of kuwait and later with saddam iraqi officials 
said no details of the meeting with saddam were released 
immediately 
jackson visited the persian gulf in 1987 meeting saudi arabian 
and jordanian leaders and delivering 600 pounds of christmas gifts 
for the crew of a us warship 
in 1984 jackson visited castro who then released some two 
dozen americans from his jails he also traveled to nicaragua 
where he praised the sandinista government to panama and to el 
salvador where he tried to mediate differences between salvadoran 
rebels and thenpresident napoleon duarte 
he paid his first visit to south africa in more than a decade in 
february when he met with black leader nelson mandela upon his 
release after 27 years in prison jackson had been refused a visa 
since 1979 
a year earlier he was in moscow to promote aid to victims of 
the december 1988 earthquake in armenia and to assess the economic 
and political reforms of mikhail gorbachev

the others flying west said a source traveling with american civil 
rights leader jesse jackson 
jackson was on the flight to kuwait and was to accompany 
evacuees all the way to washington said the airline official and 
michael cheers a photographer traveling with jackson 
cheers said the iraqi airways plane took off for kuwait a 
onehour flight at 11 am 3 am edt 
officials say 237 american and other foreign women and children 
have gathered at the melia mansour hotel in baghdad since iraqi 
president saddam hussein on tuesday said he would allow foreign 
women and minors standed in iraq and kuwait to leave 
it was not immediately known how many americans would be on the 
flight from baghdad and it was not clear if jackson had a role in 
securing the release of the foreigners 
a state department spokesman in washington said the department 
had heard several rumors over the past few days about possible 
flights out for the hostages but had no confirmation of todays 
possible departure were very hopeful he said speaking on 
condition of anonymity

an agreement guaranteeing children the 
right to a healthy environment free from abuse or exploitation 
comes into force this weekend 
the united global convention on the rights of the child takes 
effect sunday in the 29 nations that have ratified it 
in addition 105 nations including all of europe and the soviet 
union have signed the convention indicating their intention to 
ratify it but the accord is not binding on them until they do the 
united states has not yet signed 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said in a statement 
the convention addresses the needs of those who are humanitys 
most vulnerable as well as its most cherished resource 
he said the speed with which states ratified the convention and 
its entry into force less than a year after its adoption showed 
the international communitys deep commitment to enhancing respect 
for the dignity wellbeing and development of the child 
the general assembly unanimously adopted the convention last 
december 
the un childrens fund and many governments and private 
agencies say the agreement sets new standards for fighting child 
neglect sexual exploitation and other abuse 
it wraps together all the international laws concerning the 
rights of minors that were scattered among more than 80 treaties 
and declarations drafted over the last 60 years 
the convention however has engendered controversy because it 
allows anyone 15 years of age or older to be drafted into military 
service a provision the us administration supported 
more than 95000 child soldiers lost their lives in the 
iraniraq war and over 200000 15to17yearolds serve in various 
armed forces worldwide officials said 
norway sweden france west germany italy spain australia 
canada mexico and other nations wanted the draft age raised to at 
least 17 and the soviet union said it would go along with that 
standard 
the united states however held out for keeping the draft age 
at 15 arguing that the 1949 geneva conventions on warfare and the 
1977 additional protocols specify that age and the new convention 
should conform 
in another controversial issue the accord sets the end of 
childhood at age 18 but does not say whether childhood begins at 
birth or at some point earlier that had divided antiabortion and 
prochoice advocates 
the convention glosses over abortion stating only in the 
nonbinding preamble that children deserve special protection 
before as well as after birth 
the united states supported the inclusion of the reference to 
the rights of the unborn 
recognition of children as individuals with inalienable rights 
began under international law in 1924 when the league of nations 
adopted the geneva declaration on childrens rights that abolished 
the common custom of treating children as the property of their 
fathers 
the convention on the rights of the child recognizes the right 
of free association and guarantees a child the right to enjoy a 
family life 
it extends international legal protection to the adoption 
procedure ratifying governments are required to provide adoption 
services so orphans can have access to family life 
under another provision the accord says children may not be 
separated from their parents except for the childs wellbeing 
they also cannot be sold into prostitution slavery or used as 
bonded laborers to pay off parents debts 
the convention however lets ratifying nations set the minimum 
age for child laborers and regulate working conditions 
nations signing the convention must report periodically to a new 
un committee on the rights of the child 
the first world summit for children will be held in late 
september at un headquarters to mobilize the worlds governments 
to save up to 100 million children from death by disease and 
malnutrition in the 1990s 
canada egypt mali mexico pakistan and sweden are 
cosponsoring the event to push governments to redirect spending 
from military budgets and payments on their foreign debts in favor 
of health and nutrition 
the global gathering will take place during the next general 
assembly

pope john paul ii began his seventh voyage to africa 
today a trip the vatican hopes will refocus world attention on the 
plight of the poor when all eyes are turned to the persian gulf 
the 70yearold pontiff was flying by special alitalia airbus to 
dar es salaam capital of the east african nation of tanzania the 
first leg of a 10day tour that will also take him to burundi 
rwanda and the ivory coast 
the plane made an hourlong stopover on the mediterranean island 
of malta church bells pealed when the jet landed and the pope 
stepping onto the aircrafts stairs waved to a crowd at the 
airport john paul visited the island for three days in may 
john pauls 49th foreign pilgrimage will wrap up sept 10 with 
the consecration of a huge controversial basilica in ivory coast 
that rivals st peters basilica in rome 
the vatican newspaper losservatore romano on friday said the 
popes trip will serve to remind the world of africas chronic 
poverty noting that the poor stand to suffer most from the middle 
east crisis which began when iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 
the paper described the trip as a journey of peace to the land 
of the poor at a time when before the marshalling of arms the 
world seems to wince almost only at the fluctuations in the stock 
markets 
what new price will african poverty have to pay as a result of 
this new crisis losservatore romano said if the developed 
world fears recession then what about those who already live off 
the crumbs from the table of the rich 
in all the pope will travel 11600 miles and deliver 41 
speeches 
vatican officials say the pope will speak on aids which is 
particularly widespread in africa 
the pope has expressed solidarity with aids sufferers while 
condemning the sexual behavior that can transmit the disease and 
ruling out the use of condoms as a means of checking its spread 
according to the latest church statistics the number of 
catholics in africa has increased by 50 percent in the past 10 
years to a total of about 75 million or 13 percent of the 
continents population 
moslems are tanzanias largest religious group representing 
about onefourth of the population of 25 million catholics make up 
21 percent with protestants anglicans and animists accounting for 
the rest 
islam and the catholic church the two largest religious groups 
in the world have sometimes been at odds as they compete for 
converts in africa 
in tanzania church officials describe an overall situation of 
harmony between the two faiths although they see signs of 
potential conflict with fundamentalists favoring the imposition of 
the sharia or islamic law 
in burundi the popes visit will mark the end of conflict 
between church and state only three years ago all foreign 
missionaries had been expelled local priests detained weekday 
church services banned and religious education halted 
but since president pierre buyoya took power in a 1987 coup 
religious freedom has been restored and the church is working with 
the government to promote unity in a nation often torn by violence 
between the tutsi and hutu ethnic groups 
the pope will spend two nights each in burundi and rwanda before 
traveling across the continent to the west african nation of ivory 
coast where he will end his trip sept 10 by consecrating the 
basilica of our lady of peace 
the basilica modeled on st peters and nearly as large was 
built by president felix houphouetboigny in his hometown of 
yamoussoukro at a cost put by the government at 133 million the 
president says he is paying for the church with his own money 
but critics have charged the cost may be twice as high and 
described the basilica as a display of opulence in a poor country 
facing severe economic crisis 
the pope waited to consecrate the basilica until 
houphouetboigny agreed to build a hospital on the grounds 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said the holy see is not 
embarrassed by the basilica pointing out the money was not spent 
on weapons he also wondered why there was no similar outcry over 
the construction of mosques in morocco nigeria saudi arabia and 
rome that are even bigger

thirteen million japanese took part in a nationwide 
disaster drill today many of them being evacuated from 
smokefilled department stores or airlifted from elevated 
expressways and rooftops 
the drill in tokyo and nine other cities conducted annually 
since 1971 marked the 67th anniversary of the great kanto 
earthquake 
the powerful temblor later estimated at 79 on the richter scale 
hit tokyo and surrounding areas in 1923 and killed 140000 people 
following last octobers san francisco earthquake national land 
agency officials decided the emphasis of this years exercise would 
be on ways to cope with possible urban disasters officials said 
todays drill involved 13 million people 
drill organizers released smoke in department stores and train 
stations to replicate conditions during a fire 
in tokyos edogawa ward a sevenmile section of the elevated 
metropolitan expressway was closed for about 30 minutes as a large 
helicopter used a rope to lift passengers from their cars in a 
rescue drill 
it was the first such drill on an elevated expressway in japan 
the officials said 
national land agency chief moriyoshi sato flew in another 
helicopter to inspect an airdrop of emergency supplies simulations 
of rescues of people from a collapsed house and other evacuation 
drills 
as our country is naturally subject to disasters caused by 
earthquakes typhoons and volcanic eruptions the government will 
strive further to strengthen antidisaster measures kyodo news 
service quoted sato as telling about 10000 people who participated 
in the drill 
experts say an earthquake similar to the one in 1923 could hit 
the tokyo region at any time the japanese archipelago sits along a 
fault line between massive tectonic plates which slowly grind 
against each other

a solarpowered airplane is slowly nearing 
the end of its windtossed odyssey from california to kitty hawk 
nc the birthplace of powered flight 
after more than six weeks sometimes being blown the wrong way 
aviator eric raymond still has about 240 miles to go in his 
198pound plane sun seeker but strong headwinds appear to have 
dashed his hopes of reaching kitty hawk during the labor day 
weekend said his wife aida 
hes getting desperate to get there he just wants to finish 
the flight mrs raymond said in a telephone interview friday 
meanwhile the welcome mat is out where orville and wilbur 
wright piloted a motorpowered airplane for the first time in 1903 
theres a lot of excitement here said nancy mcwilliams 
spokeswoman for kitty hawk kites a hang glider school planning a 
reception for raymonds arrival its been the talk of the town 
for the last month wherever i go people say wheres eric 
whens eric arriving 
raymond 33 a former national hang gliding champion had logged 
only 18 miles for the day when he landed friday afternoon at 
virginia tech airport at blacksburg va about 25 miles west of 
roanoke va 
weve been very upset because the delays weve had on this 
trip have had nothing to do with the plane they were because of 
the weather mrs raymond said 
we thought he was going to land at kitty hawk on sunday she 
said now the weather forecast is saying the strong headwinds 
will keep up for another four days after today and he may not be 
able to fly until they stop 
the weather forecast has been so wrong all along were just 
hoping itll be wrong again she said 
when raymond took off from the new river valley airport in 
virginia on friday he had 260 miles to go and had logged 2168 
miles in 102 hours and 35 minutes in the air 
on thursday he braved the appalachians gaining 132 miles 
before landing about 35 miles west of roanoke 
it was july 16 when raymond first took off from desert center 
beginning his quest to prove an ultralight aircraft partially 
powered by solar energy could cross the united states 
rather than set a flying record raymond wants to show solar 
powers usefulness said trip spokesman jack whitehouse the plane 
has solar cells on its surfaces to run an electrical motor that 
turns its propeller 
the motor is used for takeoffs and landings after takeoff the 
motor is turned off and the plane rides the thermals like an 
ultralight glider 
two days after the sojourn began the craft was seriously 
damaged in an aborted takeoff from lordsburg nm 
raymond and his ground crew brought the craft back by land to 
lake elsinore for repairs raymond manufactured and sold hang 
gliding equipment there until six months ago when he devoted 
himself to the sun seeker project 
the sun seeker had better luck after taking off again from 
desert center on aug 2 
although the craft hasnt crashed since strong headwinds and 
rain along the way have made for slow going 
in the month since the sun seeker has remained grounded on 
eight days because of bad weather one day the craft was forced to 
land after strong headwinds pushed it backwards

gov george deukmejians plan to 
require california homeowners to pay up to 60 a year for mandatory 
earthquake coverage was approved by the legislature 
the bill was inspired by the october 1989 northern california 
quake that killed 62 people destroyed more than 1000 homes and 
caused 7 billion in damage it was sent to deukmejians desk 
friday evening after votes of 283 in the senate and 4321 in the 
assembly 
the bill would provide about 65 million property owners with up 
to 15000 of quake insurance for an annual surcharge of between 
12 and 60 
it would set up a statebacked insurance pool that would be used 
to partly recompense homeowners losses in the event of a quake it 
initially would provide up to 15000 in money that a homeowner 
would use to bridge the gap left uncovered by the average 
deductible 
quake insurance deductibles average about 10 percent of the 
market value of a home if a home is completely destroyed a 
customer can replace the house by meeting the cost of the 
deductible or about 15000 on a 150000 dwelling 
but most of the 24000 quakedamaged homes were not completely 
destroyed suffering an average of 8000 in losses each that was 
usually far less than the deductible and had to be paid by the 
homeowner 
deukmejian has 10 days to sign the bill veto it or let it 
become law without his signature

the foreign ministers of china and the soviet 
union said today that peaceful means should be used to solve the 
persian gulf crisis 
after three hours of talks with his chinese counterpart qian 
qichen soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze told 
journalists the two nations were willing to cooperate to peacefully 
resolve the standoff 
we did not have any disagreements shevardnadze said we 
both support peaceful means and peaceful channels to solve the gulf 
crisis 
he stopped short however of directly condemning the use of 
force in the region 
both china and the soviet union reluctantly supported a united 
nations resolution authorizing force to back economic sanctions 
against iraq which invaded kuwait on aug 2 
china said from the start it was opposed to the use of force and 
the soviet union backed the usproposed un security council 
initiative only after stalling for more than a week 
qian said moscow and beijing had nearly identical positions 
the present task is that parties should avoid the use of force 
to prevent an acceleration into war qian said in a separate 
meeting with journalists 
the united states britain france the soviet union and other 
nations have warships in the gulf region us vessels are 
searching ships transiting the region they suspect might be 
breaking the embargo 
in addition the united states has sent 60000 troops and dozens 
of fighter planes to saudi arabia aimed at discouraging any move by 
iraq to seize more territory 
both foreign ministers stressed the importance of an arab 
settlement to the middle east crisis they did not say however 
what peaceful means they would be willing to pursue jointly toward 
resolving the middle east crisis 
they said they intended to keep open a triangle of communication 
between their nations and the united states 
shevardnadze said his talks with qian raised sinosoviet 
relations to a unified new level in cooperation 
the communist powers split over ideological differences in 1960 
but in the last decade relations steadily improved culminating 
with soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs may 1989 visit to beijing to 
normalize ties 
shevaradnadze said the two sides would hold talks on their 
shared 4300 mile border on sept 10 in moscow china and the 
soviiet union came close to going to war after several bloody 
border clashes in 1969 
gorbachev has pledged to withdraw 120000 of the estimated 
500000 soviet troops stationed along the border by years end 
qian said a new atmosphere of trust now exists between the two 
nations 
shevardnadze on an eightday threenation tour visits north 
korea on sunday and monday before traveling to japan

a year after a labor day marred by 
riots and looting this resort city is trying to make people forget 
by putting on its finest 
many are staying away because they remember only the worst 
the table is set weve got our best linen best china best 
silver best crystal andrew fine cochairman of the community 
coordination committee said friday 
lingering fears that the rioting of last year might be repeated 
are making some of the preparations unnecessary as the citys 
hotels full to capacity during the 1989 labor day holiday are 
less than half full today 
city manager aubrey watts said that hotels were at 48 percent 
occupancy friday night but it appears to be rising 
the endofsummer party which for the past 10 years has 
attracted students from predominantly black east coast colleges 
last year erupted in looting and violent confrontations between 
youths and police damage was estimated at more than 14 million 
many of the young people and civil rights leaders said the 
clashes were racially motivated and the city did not want black 
visitors city officials said the problem was one of too many 
people in too small an area with too little to do 
more than 100000 young people jammed the citys beachfront 
strip for the 1989 labor day weekend 
early today young people walked and rode bicycles along the 
oceanfront thoroughfare city police officers and state troopers 
were out in force walking in pairs and riding horses clergymen 
accompanied many of the patrols ready to act as peacemakers 
police chief charles r wall declined to say how many officers 
were on patrol but said the entire 607member force is working 
12hour shifts over the weekend 
police said three men in a car fired into an unoccupied car 
eight blocks from the oceanfront early today no one was injured 
and there were no arrests 
police said they made only a handful of arrests for public 
drunkenness 
ive never seen it this quiet on a friday night or any other 
night for that matter said dot keller who works at clarkes pub 
last year police backed by state troopers and the national 
guard twice cleared the oceanfront after looting broke out 
hundreds of people were arrested or cited and more than 50 were 
injured most of those arrested were local residents not college 
students 
this year the city appointed a biracial committee including 
students to plan the event dubbed laborfest local merchants 
raised more than 100000 to provide entertainment along the 
oceanfront 
despite local efforts some black students at schools that 
previously frequented virginia beach called for a boycott 
mayor meyera oberndorf said she was confident the labor day 
weekend would be a successful contrast to last years violence 
we will be able to show a watching world that many things are 
possible when people trust and show respect she said friday 
night 
but some merchants boarded up storefronts for the weekend 
norfolk state university helped book two nights of entertainment 
at a city park about four miles from the oceanfront hoping to 
spread out crowds that used to congregate solely at the beach 
the city also closed a section of the oceanfront to cars and set 
up satellite parking lots away from the beach serviced by shuttle 
buses

the sighting of a makeshift watercollection 
device on a south pacific island could be a clue in the 
disappearance of us aviator amelia earhart during a 1937 
globecircling flight researchers said 
the world war iiera sighting by a former coast guard serviceman 
was reported in a letter to rick gillespie executive director of 
the international group for historic aircraft recovery in 
wilmington del 
more and more it looks like were closing in on learning 
exactly what happened he said wednesday 
richard evans 64 of annville pa wrote describing the 
rainwater collection apparatus he found while exploring an 
isolated section of nikumaroro about 1000 miles northeast of fiji 
investigators last year found another possible clue to the 
earhart disappearance on the island a navigators bookcase that 
could have come from earharts twoengine lockheed electra airplane 
evans described the watercatching device as a canvas funnel 
draining into a 5footby2foot metal container 
we didnt build it and the natives didnt build it if its 
earharts who knows people are really getting excited about it 
though said evans who was assigned to the nowuninhabited 
island to help build a coast guard navigation and communications 
base 
gillespie said the dimensions of the canvas and container as 
described by evans closely match the engine covers and one of the 
149gallon fuel tanks from earharts plane 
it could suggest ms earhart and her navigator fred noonan 
survived a landing there in july 1937 and waited in vain for 
rescue gillespie said evans said he wrote the letter to gillespie 
after reading a news report on the hunt for earharts plane 
the watercollection structure was on the windward side of the 
island the waters rough and you cant land a boat but it was a 
good spot if you were looking for a rescue plane said gillespie 
researchers theorize earhart and noonan landed on the islands 
coral reef flat but waves and tides carried the plane into the 
2000footdeep trench surrounding the atoll 
the team is scheduled to visit the island next summer and may 
conduct deepwater probes for the plane 
if its down there the water is cold enough that it should be 
well preserved gillespie said 
earharts possible route was tracked to the island by two 
retired military aviators who used 1930s navigation techniques to 
plot her likely course 
tom willi and tom gannon of fort walton beach fla persuaded 
the aicraft recovery group to mount their 250000 expedition last 
year

syrian troops and lebanese soldiers loyal 
to president elias hrawi today deployed around the gateways into 
the christian enclave amid reports an offensive to crush rebel gen 
michel aoun was imminent 
security sources said hundreds of syrians and mainly moslem 
lebanese troops were taking up positions along the western side of 
the green line dividing beirut into moslem and christian sectors 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
syrians also were deploying in the hills to the north and east of 
the 310squaremile christian enclave north of beirut 
the enclave in which an estimated 1 million christians live 
has been ringed by the syrians and their militia allies since 
april when aoun declared a war of liberation to drive out the 
syrians 
the moslem voice of the nation radio said aoun has ringed his 
headquarters in the shellwrecked presidential palace in beiruts 
eastern baabda suburb with tanks to confront any attack 
the buildup followed a summit in damascus wednesday between 
hrawi and syrian president hafez assad who pledged to provide the 
lebanese government with any assisstance needed to extend its 
authority over the whole of lebanon 
aoun controls about 40 percent of the enclave after an 
eightmonth power struggle with christian militia chieftain samir 
geagea for control of the territory aoun refuses to recognize 
hrawi who was elected nov 24 to implement an arab leaguebrokered 
plan to end lebanons 15yearold civil war 
aoun rejects the plan because it does not guarantee the 
withdrawal of 40000 syrian troops deployed in lebanon under a 1976 
arab league peacekeeping mandate he considers the syrians who 
have sided with the moslems an army of occupation 
the peace plan ratified by the lebanese parliament in october 
gives the moslems who make up about 55 percent of lebanons 4 
million people an eqaul share of power with the traditionally 
dominant christians 
hrawi has sacked aoun as interim prime minister and army 
commander but the general refuses to step down or hand over the 
ruined presidential palace that is a symbol of constitutional 
authority in lebanon 
voice of the nation along with other radio stations and beirut 
newspapers predicted that hrawis troops and syrian forces would 
soon launch an assault to evict aoun from baabda if he refused to 
move out peacefully 
the leftist assafir daily said civilians were fleeing baabda 
and its aouncontrolled environs because they feared an attack was 
likely 
aoun commands about 19000 mainly christian troops it was not 
immediately clear how many troops the syrians were deploying around 
the enclave 
hrawis forces include 22000 moslem troops commanded by gen 
emil lahoud but they are poorly equipped 
many have sat on the sidelines of the civil war for the last few 
years and it was not clear whether they would participate in an 
assault on aoun 
geagea aouns christian rival and commander of the lebanese 
forces militia has at least 6000 fighters and thousands of 
reservists 
it was not clear whether geagea who has said he accepts the 
peace plan would participate in an offensive against the general

un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar and iraqs foreign minister discussed a plan to deploy an 
arab peacekeeping force as a buffer between us and iraqi troops 
jordanian officials said today 
the senior officials declined to say how much of the plan needed 
to be cleared with the governments involved but one official 
speaking on condition of anonymity hinted that there would be an 
announcement later today 
sources also said the soviet union might play a mediating role 
in working out a simultaneous withdrawal of iraqi forces from 
kuwait and the multinational force in saudi arabia the united 
states has repeatedly said its forces will not withdraw from the 
gulf region until iraqi soldiers have left kuwait 
perez de cuellar and the iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz 
held a second day of talks on the persian gulf crisis today 
earlier an official said both were optimistic 
the two discussed prospects for freeing foreign hostages in iraq 
and for a settlement in kuwait the sources said 
the situation is very promising said a senior jordanian 
source with access to the talks he refused to elaborate 
perez de cuellar and aziz are trying to find common ground to 
defuse the crisis that began with iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
they met today after conferring for 2 hours with crown prince 
hassan at the royal palace 
hassan is regent in the absence of king hussein who is on a 
foreign tour seeking support for an arab solution of the crisis 
that began with iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait and later 
annexation of its oilrich neighbor 
as hussein continued his diplomatic mission the arab league 
concluded a twoday meeting in egypt the league hardened its 
position on the invasion by demanding iraq pay war reparations to 
kuwait after withdrawing its troops 
the league also demanded that iraq immediately free 21000 
westerners including 3000 americans it has held hostage since 
overrunning kuwait 
only 13 of the leagues 21 members were present to adopt the new 
resolutions indicating how the crisis has divided the arab world 
about 60000 us troops sent to saudi arabia face more than 
200000 iraqi troops along the saudi borders with kuwait and iraq 
in addition dozens of warships from the united states and other 
nations are patrolling the gulf region to back up unimposed 
economic sanctions on iraq 
arab countries opposed to the invasion also have sent small 
contingents of soldiers to the multinational force led by the 
united states 
perez de cuellar and iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz met in 
the royal palace amid reports that iraq would begin freeing foreign 
women and children 
perez de cuellar late friday hailed baghdads decision to 
release the women and children as an important step forward 
but from my point of view this is not enough he said i 
hope this first decision of the iraqi government will be followed 
by other decisions which will allow all foreigners to leave the 
area 
the un leader said a decision by iraq to release all 
foreigners would help reduce tension middle east some of the 
westerners held captive in iraq and kuwait have been moved to 
strategic installations to deter a us attack 
the un chief has said he is not meeting aziz to negotiate or 
make concessions on the un security council resolutions demanding 
an unconditional iraqi withdrawal from kuwait he said his purpose 
was to discuss all aspects of the problem with aziz in an effort to 
solve the crisis

a proposal to move up californias 
presidential primary from june to the first tuesday in march a 
week after the nations leadoff primary in new hampshire has been 
defeated 
lawmakers could not agree on whether to let ballot measures 
share the election 
republicans argued that democrats could benefit if voter 
initiatives were allowed to share the primary ballot democrats 
would likely post a higher voter turnout in their drive to restore 
their party to the white house they said 
without ever voting on the proposed shift the legislators 
killed it friday by voting down a constitutional amendment tied to 
it by ken maddy republican leader of the state senate such votes 
require a twothirds majority to pass 
supporters said moving the primary forward would change the 
california election from an afterthought into the nations dominant 
early primary 
the early vote was intended only for electing presidential 
convention delegates with primaries for congressional legislative 
and other races in june but californias constitution requires 
that any measure qualified for the ballot by voter initiative 
petitions must go on the next statewide ballot 
state initiatives in recent years have included huge property 
tax cuts a cigarette tax hike and major insurance education and 
environmental measures so the early ballot could have allowed 
voters of one party to decide major policy issues 
the california primary now one of the latest in the nation has 
not had a strong impact on a presidential nomination race since 
1972 when george mcgoverns victory in california cleared the way 
for his nomination as the democratic candidate

after collaborating on an economic reform 
proposal rifts have developed between president mikhail gorbachev 
and the leader of the nations largest republic over the final 
policys scope and speed 
the clash was a setback to reconciliation efforts between 
gorbachev and russian federation president boris yeltsin who 
indicated he could adopt an independent policy for his republic 
with a more marketoriented approach 
gorbachev said the government will choose from among four plans 
and will try to stabilize the faltering economy within six months 
the soviet economy is wracked by shortages of everything from 
medicine to cigarettes and citizens are furious politicians are 
pushing for economic reforms of varying speed and scope 
four separate panels are currently working on widely different 
proposals to move the soviet economy from a centrally planned 
command system to one driven primarily by market forces 
we must come out with one program gorbachev said friday 
if we lose two or three months it will affect things in such 
a way that we will have to make corrections not only in tactics but 
strategy 
the commissions include a group supervised by gorbachev and 
yeltsin who favors faster moves toward a market economy than 
gorbachev and kremlin leaders 
they went to work after the national legislature the supreme 
soviet rejected premier nikolai ryzhkovs blueprint for a 
transition to a market economy 
the supreme soviet reconvenes sept 10 to take up the latest 
proposals which gorbachev said would not be ready for another week 
but yeltsin has said that if the central soviet governments 
plan is not to his liking he will implement radical and swift 
economic reform in russia the largest of the 15 soviet republics 
yeltsin believes ryzhkovs plan would maintain the central 
governments command system that he blames for causing the 
countrys economic problems if implemented it would lead to a 
collapse yeltsin said 
gorbachev said serious measures would be taken in the next six 
months to cut off soviets ability to accumulate hot money the 
term for income derived from black marketeering and other 
activities 
the soviet union suffers from what economists call a ruble 
overhang a supply of rubles far outstripping the supply of goods 
available for purchase 
gorbachev did not say exactly how hot money would be 
controlled and did not specify what other steps were under 
consideration to stabilize the economy he said the next stage of 
economic reform would deal with prices taxes the governments 
budget and the earning distribution and use of foreign currency 
once the central government agrees on one of the reform plans 
he said it wil be presented to the legislatures of the soviet 
republics he acknowledged the proposals could face resistance 
everything is subjected to doubt to meticulous analysis 
gorbachev said 
he said the national legislature would also review the economic 
reform plan and that afterward he would issue a presidential decree 
confirming it 
ryzhkovs initial program presented in may called for drastic 
price increases on bread and other items whose prices have remained 
basically unchanged for decades the program fueled panic buying 
that made illstocked store shelves even barer

as the iraqi takeover of kuwait begins its 
second month some experts from within and outside the government 
believe direct us military action may be the best way to end the 
persian gulf crisis 
britain israel and saudi arabia are said to be recommending the 
military approach along with some members of congress some within 
the administration are offering the same advice although president 
bushs spokesman dismissed such accounts as uninformed 
speculation 
the crisis has prompted bush and soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev to hold a summit meeting perhaps as early as next 
weekend in helsinki finland administration sources said 
sen richard lugar rind a member of the foreign relations 
committee has urged military action against iraq but among 
lawmakers who left for the persian gulf friday on a factfinding 
mission none advocated an attack in comments to reporters 
the commander of the us forces in the middle east army gen 
h norman schwarzkopf ruled out the possibility that the united 
states might initiate hostilities 
theres not going to be any war unless the iraqis attack 
schwarzkopf told reporters late friday after spending the day 
visiting american troops in northeast saudi arabia 
still military commanders in the area say the capability of 
attacking iraq is there and growing by the day as more forces 
arrive 
alan keyes a former top state department official in the reagan 
administration told the cable news network friday it may 
require that well have to hit him saddam once militarily before 
he sees the light 
bush dispatched us forces to the region three weeks ago 
saying their mission was defensive but iraqi diplomats have noted 
that the presence of stealth fighters gives the united states an 
offensive capability 
the washington times reported friday that saudi arabia britain 
and israel were urging president bush to resolve the crisis with 
military force 
leaders in those countries reason that the alternative would be 
to leave oilrich countries of the persian gulf at the mercy of 
iraqs conventional chemical and nuclear weapons once us and 
other foreign forces leave the region the newspaper said some 
us officials agree with this position the times said 
meanwhile an iraqi airways jetliner was scheduled to ferry 
scores of western women and children out of iraq and occupied 
kuwait today iraqi government spokesman naji alhadithi said 
it was not immediately clear how many would be on the first 
flight but officials say 237 people already have been assembled in 
the iraqi capital and have exit visas 
civil rights leader jesse jackson who is visiting baghdad will 
accompany the evacuees on the trip said alhadithi 
some 3000 american women and children have been promised 
permission to leave iraq 
the iraqis insist on stringing this out and putting all of 
these innocent people through this cruel ordeal said state 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler she said the iraqis have 
been adding layers of red tape to the departure process 
ms tutwiler also said the state department is keeping track of 
possible war crimes by iraq 
we are of course very concerned about iraqs violations of 
international law including the taking of hostages and the use of 
civilians as a shield against military action she said 
she added it was normal policy for the us government to 
maintain files on possible violations of the laws of war 
bush spoke to saudi arabias king fahd british prime minister 
margaret thatcher and french president francois mitterrand in a 
series of morning phone calls presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said in a statement 
the president is sending secretary of state james a baker iii

nasa today delayed columbias 
astronomy mission until late next week to replace an electronic 
part used for a telescope inside the shuttle grounded first by 
fuel leaks and now cargo problems 
columbia had been scheduled to lift off today with seven 
astronauts and the 150 million astro observatory the flight was 
called off thursday night when the space agency discovered the 
fault 
workers entered the shuttles cargo bay friday to examine an 
electronic box at the base of astros xray telescope engineers 
later concluded a quick fix wouldnt be enough saying a component 
in the unit or the entire unit will have to be replaced that ruled 
out a launch attempt any earlier than thursday or friday 
nasa had hoped to launch columbia on wednesday if the component 
could be fixed easily mission managers did not set a launch date 
at a meeting today but were expected to make a decision sometime 
this weekend 
any time we get close and dont go like a kid going to the 
carnival were frustrated and were anxious to get going said 
william lenoir head of nasas space flight program but were 
not going until were ready i think were getting awfully close to 
ready 
the last shuttle flight was in april when discovery carried the 
flawed hubble space telescope into orbit delays have brought the 
longest gap between missions since flights resumed after the 1986 
challenger accident 
columbias first launch attempt on may 30 was scrubbed because 
of leaking hydrogen a similar problem was found with atlantis a 
month later and its classified pentagon flight was delayed from 
july to november 
a beleaguered national aeronautics and space administration has 
spent the summer also contending with hubbles defective mirror and 
communications problems with the venusorbiting magellan spacecraft 
nasa technicians worked into the night testing a line driver a 
component of an electronic box that routes electrical power and 
data between columbia and the xray telescope 
engineers decided they could not restore communications by 
installing a new cable but would try replacing a component that 
sends information to the line driver later today if that doesnt 
work then the whole box will be replaced 
the launch also had been threatened by a problem with a middeck 
instrument that measures acceleration and vibration launch 
director bob sieck said the instrument failed to activate properly 
during the countdown and was replaced today 
columbias sevenmember crew planned to stay at kennedy space 
center into the weekend four astronauts are astronomers who will 
operate astros three ultraviolet telescopes during the nine to 
10day flight probing some of the hottest objects in the universe 
the xray telescope will be managed by ground controllers 
the latest delay is not expected to affect astros observing 
schedule said lennard fisk nasas chief scientist scientists had 
to choose new targets after the mission was delayed in 1986 by the 
challenger explosion 
columbia has until sept 14 to lift off otherwise it will be 
forced to wait until discovery carries the sunprobing ulysses 
satellite into orbit lenoir said 
nasa must launch discovery between oct 5 and 23 to take 
advantage of the alignment of earth the sun and jupiter whose 
gravitational field will slingshot ulysses back to the sun the 
next opportunity for launch would be in 13 months 
discoverys move to nasas other shuttle launch pad was delayed 
until at least tuesday because of frayed electrical connections 
nasa said today the shuttle was supposed to have been rolled out 
sunday 
nasa is confident columbia will not leak excessively during 
fueling this time lenoir said it now appears atlantis has the 
same type of leaks as columbia which means it is a common 
problem more likely caused by contamination than a faulty design 
he said 
columbias new plumbing is from a different batch than the one 
that was removed and the one that leaked on atlantis and fared 
much better in acceptance tests said shuttle director robert 
crippen

to the west iraqi president saddam hussein is 
the butcher of baghdad the man who drops poison gas bombs on 
his own people ruthlessly eliminates rivals or invades his 
neighbors 
president bush has questioned his sanity and compared him to 
adolf hitler 
but many in the arab world regard him as a hero for standing up 
to the united states in iraq crowds motivated both by fear and 
real admiration hail him as the savior of arab nationalism 
whether hes portrayed as monster or messiah nobody fascinates 
the world today like saddam 
in the united states saddam in less than a month has gone from 
being just another faraway despot to representing the embodiment of 
evil 
gas stations have put up targets with saddams face as the bulls 
eyes tshirts portray his face on spiders and read 
iraqnophobia a reference to a recent horror film tabloids 
such as the new york daily news run headlines reading butchers 
bargain 
a recent newsweek poll found that 43 percent would support 
saddams assassination 
those who have met saddam are much in demand in the debate over 
whether he is a madman or fiend abctv broadcast tape of a 
preinvasion interview with sam donaldson and diane sawyer in which 
saddam was asked to confirm stories he had gunned down a disloyal 
aide he denied it members of congress spoke of saddam wearing a 
gun in past meetings 
peyman pejman a writer for the bismark nd tribune who met 
saddam in 1988 said the man has scary eyes he reminded 
readers that the line between madness and genius is a thin one 
students of saddam have found ample evidence to prove he is 
crazed evil or both a decade ago he presided over a firing squad 
that executed 20 officials for disloyalty in 1982 he arrested an 
aide who questioned iraqs invasion of iran and when the mans 
wife pleaded for his release saddam reportedly returned the body 
in a black bag chopped into pieces 
in 1981 he republished a pamphlet written by a favorite uncle 
titled three whom god should not have created persians jews and 
flies 
his most vicious act may have been his 1988 poison gas attack on 
kurdish villages that left thousands dead 
psychologically it is useful to have this incarnation of 
evil when a nation goes on a war footing against an adversary 
said dr jerrold m post a george washington university professor 
of psychiatry who has studied the psyche of saddam and other world 
leaders 
yet this is a man who in his own country is referred to as 
fatherleader who is lionized in poems and nursery rhymes and 
whose portrait is hung in homes and on street corners everywhere 
his personality cult is based partly on fear and intimidation 
but his bold confrontation with the west has touched a chord of 
sympathy with millions in the arab world he wants to stand up to 
the bullies rightly or wrongly said hussein hammani jordans 
ambassador to the united states he wants the arabs to have a 
sense of pride 
saddams televised meeting with western guests being held 
hostage in iraq which bush dismissed as manipulative and 
cynical may be getting better reviews in the middle east said 
stephen hess an expert in politics and the media with brookings 
institute a washington think tank 
i think hes playing to the rest of the arab world to people 
with longstanding grievances against western democracies hess 
said last week 
saddams also veered closely to the messianic as when he 
referred to the invasion of kuwait by saying a newborn child was 
born of a legitimate father and an immaculate mother greetings to 
the makers of the second of august whose efforts god has blessed 
its such megalomania and savage use of power that have drawn 
comparisons to hitler 
post the george washington university professor said saddam 
shares several psychological traits with hitler including 
paranoia extreme selfabsorption and lack of a conscience in the 
pursuit of power his grandiose face masks underlying insecurity 
while hussein is not psychotic he has a strong paranoid 
orientation post said 
saddam may even crave the bad publicity he is getting in the 
west post said he needs the limelight to be seen as one of the 
most important actors in this moment in history 
but post and others warned that the historical analogy to 
hitler who possessed far greater powers to destroy the 
international order is flawed 
time magazine writer strobe talbott in an article titled the 
dangers of demonization writes that while comparisons to hitler 
are far from preposterous there is nonetheless something 
pernicious about the analogy 
he said there is a danger many readers and listeners will at 
least subliminally take the point to its invidious extreme saddam 
equals hitler ergo arabs equal nazis 
james abourezk a prominent arabamerican and former senator 
from south dakota shared such concerns 
these kinds of overdrawn comparisons really damage the 
interests of arabamericans and our relations with all the arab 
nations he said

the possible deployment of arab troops as a buffer between us and 
iraqi forces 
the sources also said moscow might mediate the withdrawals of 
the usled multinational force from saudi arabia and the iraqi 
army from kuwait 
no details were disclosed but one official speaking on 
condition of anonymity said an announcement was possible today 
details were also in short supply regarding plans for the 
bushgorbachev meeting sources said arrangements for the session 
were sketched out last week during white house chief of staff john 
sununus visit to moscow and the meeting will probably be 
helsinki finland 
despite the diplomatic moves iraq said friday it was sending 
more foreign men to strategic installations to deter a us attack 
they will replace the women and children moved to baghdad for their 
impending release 
were relocating the foreign men all over the country at 
airports air bases military bases industrial plants 
communications centers power centers and oil refineries wherever 
iraq considers it has a vital installation one exposed to the 
american threat in saudi arabia said iraqi government spokesman 
naji alhadithi 
about 21000 westerners including 3000 americans and 4500 
britons have been prevented from leaving iraq and kuwait 
an iraqi airways jetliner was scheduled to ferry scores of 
western women and children out of iraq and occupied kuwait today

seriously ill americans and take them back to baghdad said 
alhadithi officials say 237 people already have been assembled in 
the iraqi capital and have exit visas

four days after its aug 2 invasion of kuwait iraq annexed its

ounces of tea 11 pounds of oil 17 ounces of detergent and one 
bar of soap the sources said 
children under one year of age receive three cans of powdered 
milk each month but older children receive none fresh fruit and 
vegetables from summer crops remained plentiful the sources said 
a week ago the united nations authorized the growing armada in 
the gulf region to enforce the embargo which has shut down iraqs 
oil exports the countrys main source of foreign exchange and 
prevented most imports 
last year iraq spent 29 billion to buy about 75 percent of 
its food from the united states canada australia turkey sri 
lanka and elsewhere 
long lines have formed at bakeries in baghdad and at food shops 
in smaller towns the sources said in telephone interviews flour

warweary refugees are scrambling to leave 
iraqioccupied kuwait but george karam was hurrying back saturday 
to reopen the show biz pizza place and sharalynn health club 
business explained karam a lebanese who has spent 23 years 
in kuwait ive got a big investment and they need me there 
he smiled at the prospects 
karam was among the growing tide of people going the other way 
at first it was just a trickle of palestinians who supported 
iraqi president saddam hussein now thousands each day are 
crossing from jordan into iraq en route to kuwait which iraq 
invaded aug 2 and later annexed 
those crossing have mixed motives many jordanian palestinians 
most of whom lived in kuwait before the invasion see a chance to 
earn an honest dinar others have schemes to try some have gone 
out of political zeal 
following the invasion saddam decreed that anyone not returning 
to resume activities in kuwait within two weeks would lose 
residence status the deadline has passed but people are still 
going back 
i think there is stability coming to kuwait but much to be 
done said karam who owns nine businesses he estimates that a 
quarter of his 800 employees have fled 
a wealthy man karam flew back on an iraqi airways flight 
many more are headed back by road 
all my friends will go back said mohammed yusuf a 
19yearold student whose tshirt declared i am proud to be a 
palestinian he was born in kuwait but was in jordan when iraq 
attacked 
now palestinians will have freedom he said confident that 
saddam would expand rights to palestinians and other arab 
foreigners that were denied them under the deposed kuwaiti royal 
family 
we love saddam we love him repeated yusufs friend samir 
mohammed another kuwaiti palestinian who was about to head home 
we is wonderful he is our tiger of the arab world mohammed 
said searching his english vocabulary for more words he added 
a gentleman 
some 300000 palestinians lived in kuwait before the invasion 
they made up the largest expatriate community 
as the wellheeled refugees arrived in amman they found rooms 
in luxury hotels vacated by jordanian palestinians going back 
they are all going shopkeepers engineers people with 
businesses everyone said a jordanian hotel executive who asked 
not to be named 
a reporter at the jordanianiraqi border last week saw two 
palestinian student refugees alone in a hired van five days later 
he saw the van returning to kuwait jammed with adults children 
and luggage 
the returning refugees who often surpass 2000 a day at the 
ruweishid crossing are joined by others coming across other land 
borders and on flights from arab capitals 
refugees report that although iraqi troops are closing in on 
foreigners in kuwait and some items are running short because of 
the international blockade on iraq the reduced population is 
living relatively normally 
karam said his motives were not political he thought of kuwait 
without pizza and exuded the air of a businessman who knows how to 
sniff the wind 
i am going back he said rushing off to catch his plane

president bush has decided to make available 
more hightech weapons for israel and is considering forgiveness of 
egypts 67 billion military debt to the united states a senior 
administration official says 
additional weapons for israel would bolster that countrys 
defense against iraq and offset recent decisions to sell saudi 
arabia more tanks and jet fighters officials said friday 
wiping out the 67 billion debt owed by egypt for past arms 
sales would reward an arab country lined up with the united states 
in sending troops to saudi arabia and taking part in the 
international trade embargo against iraq 
forgiving the debt would require congressional approval 
the initiative for more aid to israel came from israeli 
officials according to congressional government and private 
sources who all spoke on condition they not be identified 
israel has kept a low profile in the persian gulf crisis but 
has warned that it would consider an iraqi movement of troops into 
jordan a hostile act 
some israeli officials broached the idea of taking over us 
military equipment and ammunition in europe that would eventually 
be withdrawn because of expected agreements with the soviet union 
the new york times said in todays editions that officials were 
considering providing israel with f16 and f15 fighters apache 
antitank helicopters patriot groundtoair missiles that could be 
used against attacking missiles and m60 tanks 
the times said the israeli deal could amount to 1 billion worth 
of arms 
asked what would be made available and when an administration 
official told the associated press no decisions have been 
made at a news briefing today in kennebunkport maine national 
security adviser brent scowcroft said the united states and israel 
were in routine annual consultations about military aid 
addressing the report on egypts foreign debt scowcroft said 
we are and have been worried some time about egyptian debt 
we are reviewing the situation for all the countries that are 
heavily impacted by the gulf situation he said 
the egyptian military debt consisting of 45 billion in 
principal with the remainder interest was amassed from 1979 to 
1985 in recent years egypt has been getting annual grants of 
about 13 billion from the united states for military purposes it 
also has been receiving economic grants approaching 1 billion 
annually 
current law requires that any country more than a year in 
arrears on debt repayment be barred from further foreign aid 
federal officials had scheduled meetings on how to avoid that 
penalty when iraq invaded kuwait 
officials considered three options outright cancellation of the 
debt a buyback in which egypt would repay some fraction of the 
face amount and a freeze on interest payments 
the preferred option given to the president officials said was 
forgiveness an option opposed by the treasury department on the 
grounds that it was too large a sum to wipe off the books in a time 
of us budget stringency 
the washington post said in todays editions bush had decided on 
forgiveness but the senior official said such a course was one 
of the options being reviewed by the administration

former us sen lawton chiles came 
out of retirement with a highminded pledge to revolutionize modern 
politics 
but before chiles can lead his envisioned reforms he must hold 
off us rep bill nelsons bid to defeat him in tuesdays 
democratic gubernatorial primary 
republican gov bob martinez meanwhile no longer looks like 
the easy mark democrats hoped for in the november general elections 
that both parties say could be a watershed for florida 
the firstterm governor has ignored four primary foes in a 
television blitz that portrays him as a family man who fights taxes 
and drugs protects the environment and works hard to get convicts 
into the electric chair 
recent polls have indicated martinez is running ahead of nelson 
and for the first time within range of chiles whose negative 
ratings with voters have risen during the heated campaign 
ive gotten what i need out of the democratic primary said 
martinez campaign manager jm mac stipanovich 
chiles and nelson both have promised to work for the winner of 
the democratic primary which nelson describes as a family 
fight democrats are worried though because a bitter 1986 
primary was widely blamed for enabling martinez to defeat the 
battered nominee steve pajcic and become the states second 
republican governor since reconstruction 
the gop believes it can reelect martinez win the state senate 
for its first legislative majority this century and thus control 
redistricting that could bring florida four new us house seats in 
1992 
martinez is expected to easily win the gop nomination against 
maverick state sen marlene woodson howard who maintains martinez 
is unelectable because of his support for a services tax that was 
later repealed and his antiabortion activism three political 
unknowns also are on the gop ballot 
chiles 60 jumped into the governors race in april saying he 
wanted to stop the domination of big money in politics his 
rejection of specialinterest influence could spread around the 
nation says chiles taking inspiration from the eastern europe 
revolts 
come join us in the plaza he implores 
nelson who has raised almost 6 million to the nearly 2 
million chiles has raised with a selfimposed 100 limit on 
individual contributions would be beholden to special interests as 
governor chiles says 
what were saying is the way you campaign says a lot about the 
way you would govern he says 
chiles running mate is former threeterm us rep kenneth 
buddy mackay who also has a stellar ethics reputation mackay 
who narrowly lost the 1988 election for chiles senate seat to 
republican connie mack persuaded chiles to join him in a last 
hurrah 
if the voters dont respond to the way were doing this 
campaign were history says mackay 57 
nelson 47 is a sixterm congressman who was well on his way to 
the democratic nomination before chiles entered the race two other 
democrats dropped out when chiles dropped in 
nelson has tried to portray chiles image for pristine ethics as 
exaggerated and says chiles has a double standard 
chiles health particularly his midcampaign return to use of 
the antidepressant prozac also has been raised and nelson has 
implied that chiles is a quitter for retiring from the senate when 
his term ended in january 1989 
but recent polls indicated chiles was pushing his lead over 
nelson well past double digits and that nelson was suffering a 
backlash nelsons running mate state house speaker tom gustafson 
was widely criticized and finally apologized for suggesting chiles 
could be suicidal 
chiles has chastised nelson for negative politics he also has 
charged that nelson with his slogan a new generation of 
leadership is trying to pit young against old polls have 
indicated chiles strongest support comes from voters over 60 
at the century village condominium community in broward countys 
deerfield beach veteran democratic activist charlie goldstein 
expressed resentment at the nelson campaign 
everybody over age 55 has health problems thats not an 
issue said goldstein organizing a chiles rally for sunday his 
condo community has nearly 11000 registered voters and the 
predominantly democratic retirees in such south florida communities 
are known for higher turnouts than the general population 
in a televised debate nelson criticized chiles for retiring at 
a time when he chaired the senate budget committee and had 18 
years seniority that put him in good position to help florida and 
reduce the federal deficit 
it was casey at the bat full count and chiles turned on 
his heel he walked away and walked into the dressing room and he 
turned in his uniform nelson said 
chiles attributed his retirement decision to burnout and 
frustration with the lack of commitment by both the president and 
democratic leadership to reducing the deficit 
he says he decided to run for governor because the job offers a 
handson chance to make changes 
the two moderate democrats have expressed few differences on the 
issues each time nelson has raised an apparent distinction chiles 
has responded by embracing the same position chiles now says he is 
against government interference on abortion would ban assault 
rifles and supports a sevenday handgun waiting period 
nelson says chiles has been evasive and is running a trustme 
campaign that will face much heavier fire in the general election 
campaign 
mackay says the primary has been more negative than chiles has 
faced in the past but that it may have been good practice 
martinez has raised more than 7 million and stipanovich is known 
for killer political instincts 
some of the attacks we anticipated but not in the primary 
campaign mackay said it may turn out that its better that 
way weve been able to develop a quickresponse mechanism

an iraqi airways jet scheduled to fly at 
least four ailing americans and 146 us and british women and 
children out of iraq and kuwait was delayed in baghdad today 
sources in the iraqi capital said 
a second jetliner also sat on the baghdad runway the official 
iraqi news agency reported no reason was provided for the delay 
the news agency quoting an unidentified source at the iraqi 
ministry of culture and information said british and us 
authorities had agreed to a request from iraq for the aircraft 
transporting the women and children to use landing facilities and 
refuel 
but iraqi officials were awaiting a response to a similar 
request made to french officials for the use of landing facilities 
in paris the news agency said in paris the french foreign 
ministry said the plane was to stop at orly airport to drop off 20 
french women and children before proceeding to london the second 
iraqi airways jetliner was to carry 72 women and children to amman 
jordan 66 japanese two australians and four others of 
undetermined nationality said government spokesman naji alhadithi 
the foreigners were among an estimated 21000 westerners and 
japanese who were trapped when iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
causing world economic and military pressure against the government 
of president saddam hussein 
both planes had been scheduled to take off from baghdad today at 
about 6 pm 10 am edt alhadithi said he had said at a news 
conference that the plane carrying the british and us nationals 
would fly to london then washington 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said today that seven british and three american women received 
exit visas from iraqi officials today but that their husbands who 
were accompanying them were all detained 
officials have said 237 women and children have been assembled 
at a hotel in baghdad since tuesday when saddam said they would be 
allowed to leave red tape slowed the process with the government 
requiring exit visas 
american civil rights leader jesse jackson was aboard a plane 
that flew to kuwait this morning to pick up four or five 
seriously ill americans and bring them back to baghdad the 
government spokesman said 
he did not say whether the ailing americans were men or women 
or elaborate on their condition 
he said baghdad had received word from the united states 
through diplomatic channels that some ailing americans were 
among the foreigners stranded in kuwait after iraqs invasion 
the americans apparently were hiding to avoid internment by the 
iraqis who have used many foreigners as human shields to fend off 
any attack by usled multinational forces based in saudi arabia 
alhadithi said when jackson met with saddam earlier this week 
he appealed for their release 
a west german commercial airliner left from frankfurt for iraq 
today to pick up german women and children the west german foreign 
ministry said the ministry said the flight was arranged to pick up 
an estimated 100 west german women and children in iraq but would 
likely include other westerners as well 
we expect the plane to be full said the spokesman the 
plane has 259 seats about 450 west germans are in iraq and 260 are 
believed held in kuwait the ministry said 
japans foreign ministry said a plane chartered by the japanese 
government left this morning for jordan to pick up japanese women 
and children allowed to leave a foreign ministry official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity said a total of 80 japanese 
including 68 women and children and 12 dependents of japanese 
embassy personnel in iraq are to be flown to japan 
in madrid the spanish foreign ministry said 52 spaniards were 
to be evacuated aboard a lufthansa plane 
alhadithi who is directorgeneral of the ministry of 
information said britain and the united states have granted the 
iraqi airways jetliner permission to land in london and washington 
but we are surprised that we still have not received a 
positive response from the french government alhadithi said 
he said the same plane is to bring back iraqis stranded in 
europe and the united states since the invasion but again provided 
no numbers 
britains foreign office said it would have no objection to 
iraqis returning to baghdad aboard flights airlifting people out 
in france 26 iraqi military personnel and civilians connected 
with the defense program remain in the cities where they were 
undergoing training programs before the invasion 
the french have not linked their departure to westerners in iraq 
meanwhile 24 italian women and children arrived in rome today 
a day after most of them left iraq twelve of the women and all 
seven children had been in kuwait city during the invasion and 
traveled to baghdad a week ago 
another italian woman from baghdad and four from the iraqi city 
of mosul joined the group in amman jordan on friday 
coming home is a beautiful feeling even if the iraqis were 
always very courteous to us said regina garofalo a singer who 
had been performing at a kuwait hotel at the time of the invasion

the nations teachers are disenchanted with 
reform are dissatisfied with their work conditions and feel left 
out of decision making according to a survey released saturday 
three out of five 61 percent said teacher morale at their 
schools was just fair or poor according to a nationwide 
poll of 21389 elementary and secondary school teachers conducted 
by the carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching 
a startling 96 percent said lack of funds was forcing them to 
spend an average of 250 of their own money on supplies to support 
classroom activities 
just 18 percent gave school reform efforts a grade of a or 
b compared with 31 percent in a 1987 carnegie survey and 28 
percent graded the reform movement d or f compared with 19 
percent in the previous survey 
the findings should cause the nation grave concern said 
foundation president ernest l boyer in a forward to the report 
the condition of teaching 1990 
the signals are clear that teachers think reform has more to 
do with politics than with classrooms and student performance 
boyer said in an interview 
sadly after nearly a decade of intense school reform we find 
the majority of veteran teachers reporting no change or decline 
since 1983 on many of the conditions critical to a healthy climate 
for teaching and learning in their schools the report concluded 
 
four out of 10 teachers said theyd choose another profession if 
they had it to do over again 
the conclusion is clear improved working conditions are 
essential if we hope to attract and hold outstanding teachers 
boyer said 
on the other hand half the nations teachers say they are more 
enthusiastic about their profession than when they started their 
careers and 55 percent said they subordinate all other aspects of 
their life to their jobs the survey was conducted by mail last 
january and february based on a random sample of public school 
teachers in each state it had a margin of error of plus or minus 1 
percentage point 
among results 
seventyone percent said they are not at all or only 
slightly involved in student promotion and retention decisions 
the same percentage as three years ago 
just 1 percent said they have a major role in evaluating peers 
sixtyfour percent said they have less than an hour a day of 
scheduled time to prepare for classes 
seventy percent said counseling services are fair or 
poor 
thirtyeight percent complain that classes are too big 
the survey also found that 20 percent of elementary teachers 
said neglected students are a serious problem in their school 
up from 9 percent three years ago 
a secondary school teacher from illinois wrote currently 
seven of my students parents are getting divorces one 
stepfather raped his daughter two girls told me of sexual abuse 
when they were young one boy killed himself two boys related to 
me of suicide attempts one girl ran away to florida for two months 
and now has a child one got pregnant had an abortion and now has 
a 2weekold child 
still state data revealed a few bright spots 
thirtyseven percent of teachers nationwide said their salaries 
were good or excellent but in connecticut where average 
pay ranked second nationally at 41412 in 198990 82 percent 
considered salaries good or excellent 
thirtynine percent of teachers nationwide consider morale 
good or excellent but 53 percent of teachers in maine felt 
that way 
nearly six out of 10 teachers in kansas and wyoming said support 
services are good or excellent 
seventy percent of vermont teachers said they are deeply 
involved in choosing texts and other instructional materials

a federal prosecutors secret computer 
files including sealed indictments and pending fbi investigations 
mistakenly were sold for 45 to a businessman who thought he was 
buying only a broken computer system 
charles hayes said government agents finished a ninehour search 
of his office early today for the computer equipment with the 
secret files they seized nine computer terminals a computer 
memory device and other assorted equipment in their search he said 
hayes who sells government surplus equipment said he would 
have handed over the computers anyway and was trying to get back 
the items he had already resold 
he called the sale of the equipment aug 3 the worst case of 
bureaucracy i have ever seen if it is this loose i wonder what 
else is missing up there 
what it amounts to is i am being punished for the inefficiency 
in the prosecutors office said hayes 
he said about nine people including federal marshals and staff 
from the us attorneys office in lexington took part in the 
search on his business friday night they had a search warran 
hayes said 
in a lawsuit filed thursday the us justice department 
demanded that hayes of rural pulaski county return the computers 
immediately the government also wants him to tell who bought the 
equipment or had access to the data 
court documents said a technician failed to erase the memory of 
the computer at the us attorneys office in lexington before the 
government sold the system in july to hayes 
according to the lawsuit the computers memory and backup 
storage tapes contain sensitive details about fbi informants 
federally protected witnesses sealed indictments and personal 
information about employees in us attorney louis defalaise 
office 
the us attorneys office used some or all of the computer 
equipment to prepare and store virtually every document and 
record generated by both the civil and criminal divisions of the 
office from 1983 to 1989 the lawsuit said 
if made public the files could ruin criminal investigations and 
cause great harm and irreparable injury to the work of us 
prosecutors the seriousness of the injury to the united states 
of america cannot be understated the lawsuit said 
within hours of the lawsuits filing us district judge eugene 
siler jr ordered hayes immediately to return the computer system 
to the government and not examine copy or distribute the data a 
hearing was set for sept 4 
hayes said the government told him the computers memory had 
been wiped before he obtained it he said a customer bought a 
computer storage device and several tapes presumably containing the 
secret files 
he said he has asked the customer to return the items 
in washington justice department spokesman michael w robinson 
declined to comment on what effect if any release of the tapes 
would have on past and pending litigation or informants 
we cant be sure what is on there until we see it robinson 
said 
in lexington defalaise declined to comment citing the pending 
lawsuit in a deposition defalaises former secretary said she 
stored all final drafts of criminal and civil matters in the 
computers memory 
a technician for harrislanier corp the computers 
manufacturer thought he erased the computers memory in january 
the lawsuit said 
in july hayes bid 45 for the system 13 computer terminals 
two central memory units two cartridge module drives and nine 
printers the system had 93 megabytes of memory and could store 
hundreds of thousands of pages 
after hayes picked up the equipment on aug 3 the harrislanier 
technician told government officials he didnt erase the memory 
after all a magnetic probe used to scramble the data was too weak 
because the computers were broken technicians couldnt purge 
the memory through normal computer commands the information 
almost certainly remained stored within some parts of the computer 
equipment the lawsuit said 
hayes said fbi agents who visited his business aug 17 treated 
him rudely and departed after a bitter exchange when they attempted 
to examine his office without a search warrant 
the justice department contends in the lawsuit that hayes hasnt 
been forthcoming the officials also contend that hayes with the 
help of his computer technician jim freeman can retrieve the data 
hayes denied he has looked at the sensitive information

after 17 years in las vegas the jerry lewis 
labor day telethon will try to shake its lounge lizard image this 
weekend moving to hollywood in search of trendier acts lower 
costs and a fresher look 
the 21hour long muscular dystrophy association fundraiser 
celebrates its 25th anniversary from the star search theater on 
sunset boulevard where ed mcmahon presents his glitzy talent show 
the nationwide broadcast begins at 9 pm edt sunday and ends 
630 pm monday 
among the scheduled entertainers are such youthoriented acts as 
rapper mc hammer tony toni tone en vogue cast members from 
the young riders fred savage of the the wonder years and 
bob saget of americas funniest home videos 
behind the scenes lewis no longer acts as one of the producers 
and will serve only as a host producer george schlatter real 
people and rowan and martins laughin takes sole producer 
credit 
the mda announced in january that schlatter would be the 
executive producer for the show lewis later said the telethon had 
used five other producers over the years and he welcomed 
schlatters involvement 
i just couldnt work that hard and keep going said lewis 
64 come air time i would be so exhausted it was hard to 
continue at that pace 
but the show hasnt entirely abandoned tradition bill cosby 
will appear in a remote feed from las vegas and the program still 
will have such telethon fixtures as lewis mcmahon norm crosby and 
top 40 radio countdown king casey kasem 
and schlatter says lewis will probably once again sing 
youll never walk alone to close the show 
im not looking to redo the whole thing schlatter said 
tuesday its been too successful for too long were celebrating 
the accomplishments of the last 25 years and kind of renewing the 
dedication to moving it into the 90s 
over the years the telethon has raised more than half a billion 
dollars to fight neuromuscular diseases that kill and cripple 
thousand of people annually most of them young 
the las vegas shows were always successful in terms of pledges 
with last years tally a record 422 million but even as pledges 
went up viewership went down from 1985 to 1989 the show drew 
increasingly smaller audiences 
in addition it was becoming increasingly more expensive to 
produce the telethon from there 
the accommodations had to be converted into television studios 
and entertainers and crew members were flown in usually from los 
angeles said telethon spokeswman jim brown 
we dont know how much well save this year because were 
right in the middle of it all he said but we hope to save 
something 
in moving to los angeles the telethon can use a working 
television studio and can tap a ready supply of talent much of it 
the stars of choice for younger viewers 
among the newer groups on the bill tony toni tone has been 
hot on the charts this summer with its single feels good and en 
vogues single hold on has gone platinum mc hammers album 
please hammer dont hurt em is credited with selling over 5 
million copies more than any other rap album 
one drawback might be a shortage of walkin fans in las vegas 
telethon coordinators could round up willing audience members at 
any hour because the gambling casinos are open roundtheclock 
finding charityminded fans at 3 am on hollywoods sunset 
boulevard could prove more problematic 
the jerry lewis telethon began in new york city in 1966 
emanating from a single tv station and raising 1 million it moved 
to las vegas in 1973 and raised 135 million that year 
the telethon now is carried by 200 stations and is viewed 
annually by an estimated 100 million people 
while jerry lewis does his shtick in los angeles this weekend 
jerry lee lewis is twisting and shouting in a rock benefit for 
muscular dystrophy in san bernardino the three days of rock music 
of the 1950s 1960s and 1970s which began saturday features 
performers such as lewis the commodores fats domino and eddie

saudi arabias defense minister 
said saturday that foreign troops in the kingdom would not be 
allowed to initiate attacks unless iraqi forces cross into saudi 
territory 
the kingdom of saudi arabia is not a theater for any action 
that is not defensive for saudi arabia prince sultan bin abdul 
aziz told a news conference 
his comments appeared to rule out the use of saudi arabia as a 
base for possible efforts to strike inside iraq or drive out 
occupation forces in kuwait 
us army gen h norman schwarzkopf the commander of american 
forces here said friday there would be no war unless iraqi 
president saddam hussein made the awfully stupid mistake of 
attacking saudi arabia 
us officials say more than 100000 troops including those 
aboard dozens of ships in the persian gulf and red sea are in the 
region or on the way the deployment could go as high as 250000 
the usled multinational force is facing more than 200000 
iraqi troops poised along the saudi borders with iraq and kuwait 
iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 in a dispute over oil and land then 
annexed the small emirate 
prince sultan who met with reporters after delivering a speech 
to saudi military cadets said any peaceful solution would have 
in mind the immediate withdrawal of iraqi troops from kuwait 
he was vague when asked how an iraqi withdrawal could be 
achieved without military action be he said saudi arabia will 
not initiate hostilities against other arab state 
war should always be a last resort said prince sultan who 
spoke through an interpreter 
the prince a younger brother of king fahd condemned iraq for 
placing foreigners at strategic sites to serve as human shields 
against attack

the government isnt doing a good enough job 
informing the public about its automobile tire testing program an 
auto safety group says so in a report for release sunday it drew 
up its own list of the longestlasting tires 
based on the government results the center for auto safety 
ranked the most popular tires manufactured by 26 radial tire 
companies to help consumers buy the safest and most longlasting 
tire for their money 
without readily available ratings consumers remain at the 
mercy of tire companies the centers clarence ditlow said 
ditlow said the government should be disseminating the results 
of its extensive tire testing program right now the government 
will give anyone who asks its test data on nearly 1800 passenger 
car tires free of charge 
but ditlow in a letter to jerry r curry administrator of the 
national highway traffic safety administration said a list of the 
best and worst tires would be more useful 
the government responded that it doesnt want to pick winners 
and losers 
were not going to make judgments nhtsa spokesman kent 
milton said some people want a lot of traction and some want 
more mileage its not in our purview to say which is the best 
vehicle the best tire or the best headlight 
the government rates tires according to three grades tread 
wear traction and temperature characteristics for tread wear the 
centers list shows the general americlassic and vogue cbr vi to be 
the best with ratings of 400 which would carry them 80000 miles 
under test conditions each rating point is worth about 200 miles 
general also manufacturers one of the lowestranked tires in the 
centers list the xp2000 zg which tied with yokohamas 60 and 
70a001ra0089 for a rockbottom rating of 50 good for 10000 
miles 
inconsistencies in durability and quality between and among 
companies are rampant the center report said it said sears 
produces tires such as the road handler that is rated for 62000 
miles while it also makes tires with names that evoke safety such 
as the guardsmanweatherman which is rated at 140 good for 28000 
miles 
the center recommends that consumers get the price of tires they 
want to buy and divide it into the mileage rating to compare costs 
of various tires per mile manufacturers are required to mold the 
ratings onto the tires 
the grades for traction are either a b or c with a being the 
best and c being the minimum to meet government standards 
temperature grades of a b or c measure the tires ability to run 
at lower temperatures which help reduce the possibility of 
blowouts or tread separation 
a government pamphlet says even a cgraded tire is not 
unsafe and warns that underinflation or overloading will 
overheat and damage any tire and greatly increase the chance of a 
blowout 
the pamphlet also says personal driving style characteristics 
of the car and how and where it is driven as well as tire 
maintenance can influence tire life more than brand name or the 
price paid 
the tire industry accused the center of oversimplifying the 
government test results thomas e cole chairman of the tire 
industry safety council said numerical tread wear grades do not 
guarantee tire mileage 
the best way to maximize tire performance and highway safety 
this holiday and throughout the year is through proper inflation 
proper maintenance and frequent inspection for road damage cole 
said 
regardless of the tire grade cole said the actual life of any 
tire depends primarily on road surface quality driving habits 
tire inflation wheel alignment and rotation 
he recommended that the buyers combine the federal testing 
information with personal driving considerations as well as dealer 
recommendations

the bush administration unable thus 
far to prod iraqs saddam hussein out of kuwait with a massive 
military buildup and international diplomacy is bracing for a 
drawnout and costly war of nerves 
a month after president bush ordered the biggest deployment of 
troops since the vietnam war the administration is refocusing its 
strategy for the long haul in the short term bushs highprofile 
weekend meeting with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev is certain to 
emphasize saddams isolation 
administration officials say they still believe that the waiting 
game with iraq can be won but concede many questions remain about 
saddams ability to weather the economic embargo against his nation 
although a prolonged desert standoff always was deemed possible 
administration officials say that until now most attention was 
focused on shortrange goals and not the consequences of a 
1billion a month indefinite us military presence in the persian 
gulf region 
with the memory of last winters successful panama blitz still 
fresh detailed longterm planning had been only sketchy said 
officials speaking on the condition of anonymity 
still no one was under the impression that it was a quickfix 
situation said one official here with the president everyone 
knew it could take weeks or months 
with the president himself now voicing open pessimism about 
prospects for a diplomatic solution the administration is 
improvising a longrange policy 
for the first time the administration is considering proposing 
to congress a delay of grammrudman deficitreduction targets 
because of the cost of the persian gulf operation according to 
sources 
the targets pointing the way to a balanced budget by fiscal 
year 1993 could not have been met anyway 
they call for reducing the federal deficit to 64 billion in the 
fiscal year that begins in just a month a herculean task that 
would have called for some 100 billion in spending cuts andor tax 
increases even before the persian gulf operation 
congress returns from its summer recess this week and bush 
returns from his 25day working maine vacation as budget talks 
resume and congress begins to take a look at the crisis the 
longrange costs and consequences of the us military buildup will 
take center stage 
the issue of how long american troops can remain in saudi arabia 
is surely one that will be in the forefront 
how long a us presence can be maintained without draining the 
treasury and losing american support is an open question 
americans are an impatient crowd said rep newt gingrich 
rga house minority whip 
the us military presence in saudi arabia and the persian gulf 
will go on as long as it takes to have these united nations 
sanctions fully implemented bush said 
one senior administration official said that it is now clear 
that saddam hussein is feeling the impact of the embargo the 
official said the iraqi leader is desperately contacting other 
nations seeking to barter oil for commodities 
building on lessons learned in panama the administration acted 
decisively and quickly in sending forces to the middle east and in 
rallying international condemnation of iraq in the days after the 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait by iraq 
but there is little in common between the panama invasion and 
the middle east buildup 
the operation all but assured that iraq would not invade saudi 
arabia but thus far has done little toward dislodging saddam from 
kuwait and the iraqi leader raised the ante by refusing to allow 
thousands of foreigners including about 3000 americans to leave 
the country 
the administration never really plotted a long range strategy 
for dealing with saddam officials conceded 
there couldnt be a worse time for a drawnout military 
expenditure with a budget crisis brewing even before the crisis 
flared 
prospects of an administration shift of thinking on grammrudman 
targets was alluded to by white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
these are all matters to be considered by the negotiators when 
they meet this week he said we will have a proposal to put 
on the table we trust the democrats will and discussion of 
grammrudman targets would all be a part of those deliberations 
the president himself has been vague on longrange strategy 
its difficult at this juncture to know fully what the impact 
will be clearly it will have some budget implication bush said 
in his thursday news conference 
the united states is prepared to wage a long economic war of 
attrition against iraq mindful that this strategy may impart a 
human toll on iraqis theres nothing thats painless bush 
asserted 
by the same token iraqis are used to long periods of 
deprivation having just emerged from an eightyear war with iran 
at the same time administration officials say saddams invasion 
has changed some of the dynamics of the middle east for good and 
the dynamics will be permanently altered even if saddam is not 
toppled 
id like to think that out of this dreary performance by 
saddam hussein there could be now an opportunity for peace all 
through the middle east bush said 
the only goal the united states has enunciated so far whether 
long range or short range is the complete withdrawal of iraqi 
troops from kuwait restoration of the former leadership and 
freedom of movement for foreigners now stuck in either country 
and while the administration is now down playing the prospects 
of a diplomatic initiative perhaps one will hit pay dirt says 
bush

a federal judge has ordered a northern 
california city to let antilogging groups hold a labor day march 
and rally at a lumber mill 
us district judge stanley weigel issued a temporary 
restraining order after the city of fortuna in humboldt county took 
no action on the groups request for a permit to hold activities 
outside pacific lumber co 
weigel said if the demonstrators lawsuit proceeded they were 
likely to show that the denial of a permit violated freedom of 
expression 
the march follows a summer of protests by activists against 
increased cutting of socalled oldgrowth trees trees from 
longestablished stands in humboldt and mendocino counties 
between 750 and 1000 people plan to march through fortuna to the 
lumber mill and lay wreaths to lament the death of the forest 
fortuna is about 260 miles north of san francisco 
just two weeks before the scheduled march fortuna passed an 
ordinance increasing from 14 to 20 days the application time 
required for parade permits 
weigel said the change was suspiciously timed and appeared to be 
aimed at blocking the march an assertion denied by a lawyer for 
the city 
the judge urged the american civil liberties union which 
represented the demonstrators and the city to reach an agreement 
that would allow the march when that did not happen by midday 
friday he signed an order prohibiting the city from blocking a 
march of up to two hours

president bush said today that he 
and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev will meet next sunday in 
helsinki finland to discuss the middle east crisis and other 
international issues 
we have many matters to discuss bush told reporters 
a simultaneous announcement of the oneday summit was made on 
the soviet television show vremya and transmitted by the state tass 
news agency it said the two leaders would discuss international 
and bilateral questions 
in a brief session with reporters before an afternoon of golf 
bush said he was reluctant to say that the meeting was about the 
crisis in the middle east but acknowledged it would be on the 
agenda 
he said he and gorbachev would touch upon a wide array of 
issues including the conventional forces treaty yet to be 
concluded to cover troop reductions in europe it will be 
freeflowing discussions he said 
bush dampened speculation that moscow would play a role in 
mediating the crisis with iraq 
i dont see a mediating role at all for gorbachev bush 
said there are a lot of mediators out there 
senior jordanian officials in amman had reported that moscow 
might assume such a role 
bush said that he had not discussed the persian gulf crisis 
directly with gorbachev by phone because he has known for some time 
that he would be seeing him 
bush asserted several times that it would not be a oneissue 
summit 
i cant say the middle east has nothing to do with this 
meeting but its not the whole thing bush said 
the summit will be his third meeting as president with 
gorbachev gorbachev also met five times with president reagan 
bush said his wife barbara would travel to helsinki and that 
raisa gorbachev would accompany the soviet president 
bush said he does not see any more flexibility on the part of 
iraqs saddam hussein than before 
i dont want to mislead the american people by suggesting 
there is some breakthrough at hand he said 
the president accused saddam of a tawdry and outrageous 
performance in posing with hostages in a series of television 
messages to the west bush said it was despicable 
on another subject bush said it was his gut instinct to 
recommend to congress that it forgive some of egypts 7 billion 
military debt to the united states as a gesture of appreciation for 
its support in the current crisis 
just two hours before bushs announcement national security 
adviser brent scowcroft had refused to confirm that a summit would 
take place but he told reporters that there was a lot for bush and 
gorbachev to talk about from the persian gulf crisis to 
developments in cambodia and afghanistan 
in the midst of the scowcroft briefing white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater took a call from the secretary of state and then 
scribbled a note to the national security adviser they whispered 
briefly together and then turning back to reporters scowcroft 
said stay tuned well have an announcement at 1 oclock 
laughing he added i knew i shouldnt have done this 
briefing 
asked about the timing of the announcement scowcroft said there 
were certain issues of diplomatic niceties and an agreement 
on when these things are announced 
on other gulfrelated issues scowcroft said 
ambassador nathaniel howell and a handful of diplomatic 
personnel would remain in the us embassy in kuwait as long as 
possible to assist the 2500 americans there where would they 
citizens turn they are there to try to help americans he said 
saddam is playing a game with hostages in which the ground 
rules change daily and sometimes hourly we demand that he release 
all innocent civilians detained against their will 
un secretarygeneral perez de cuellar would remain in iraq 
until sunday 
what he went there for was to impress upon saddam hussein that 
the world community has spoken unless saddam hussein is prepared 
to meet that framework its difficult to see how there would be 
successful negotiations said scowcroft speaking of the 
unimposed sanctions against iraq 
there is no difference between an arab solution and an 
international solution to the crisis but he also said the arabs 
are and ought to be out in front on this he said he did not want 
to single out the arabs from the world community as expressed 
through the united nations which is taking a position against 
flagrant aggression 
arrangements for the bushgorbachev summit were sketched out 
during white house chief of staff john sununus visit this week to 
moscow administration sources said bush and gorbachev last held a 
summit may 30 to june 3 in the united states they had met 
previously on the mediterranean island of malta in december 1989 
at a moscow news conference friday night gorbachev did not 
mention the possibility of a meeting with bush but he said he is 
in constant contact with many world leaders including bush 
bush is spending the long holiday weekend with his wife barbara 
and assorted children and grandchildren at their seaside vacation 
home on walkers point 
the tension level among bush and his aides appears to have 
eased as administration officials said the situation in the 
persian gulf was settling a bit following the crisis mode that 
was sparked by iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
bush appeared relaxed and jovial when he hosted a picnic friday 
for the press corps covering his trip 
earlier in the day he was on the telephone talking to king fahd 
of saudi arabia prime minister margaret thatcher of great britain 
and french president francois mitterrand 
fitzwater said the president outlined his plans to raise money 
from wealthy nations to support the us military buildup in the 
persian gulf and to provide economic aid for poor countries 
suffering as a result of the trade embargo against iraq 
the foreign leaders each of whom has had repeated contact with 
bush since the gulf crisis began agreed to stay in close 
communication on the matter fitzwater said 
officials with bush in kennebunkport also said friday that there 
was some pressure building from allies and members of congress to 
move militarily against iraqs president saddam hussein the 
sources spoke on condition of anonymity and did not further 
identify those supporting a military move 
the officials said the pressure by no means constituted a 
consensus they indicated that mainstream opinion within the 
administration and the congress and among us allies was to stay 
with the current policy of using economic sanctions to force saddam 
to roll back 
bush returns to washington on monday evening

boris n yeltsin populist president of the 
russian republic sharply criticized soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev saturday over plans to free the sinking economy of 
government control and let the market rule 
he rejected gorbachevs call of a day earlier for the merger of 
two vastly different blueprints for economic reform 
yeltsin told a news conference at the russian federation 
headquarters we wont go along with merging the two programs 
thats completely unrealistic that would be a brake not only on 
economic reform but also on the entire renewal of society and the 
political life of our country 
the president is showing indecisiveness in this regard he 
said 
one plan prepared by premier nikolai i ryzhkov calls for the 
government to retain control over prices initially and for 
longterm denationalization of industries and property 
the other drafted by a governmental advisory board outlines 
more rapid lifting of price controls and a quick switch to private 
control of most industries and private individual property 
yeltsin said the plan by stanislav shatalin a member of 
gorbachevs presidential council advisory group should be 
presented to the legislatures of the nation and the 15 republics 
the clash was the latest in a rocky threeyear relationship 
during which gorbachev kicked yeltsin out of the soviet leadership 
for blasting reform plans as too timid and yeltsin staged a 
political comeback based on widespread popular support 
a new poll taken in july by the national center for 
sociopolitical studies indicated that yeltsins popularity rose 
from 290 percent to 471 percent since last year and gorbachevs 
fell from 362 percent to 184 percent ryzhkovs rating fell from 
206 percent to 31 percent 
a report on the poll by the independent news agency interfax 
gave no margin of error nor did it say how the survey was 
conducted 
the latest dispute was a setback to the efforts of a 12member 
committee of leading economists assembled jointly by gorbachev and 
yeltsin in july to develop a common policy on economic reform 
gorbachev told a news conference friday night that the two plans 
must be merged into a document that reflects general agreement 
yeltsin believes the plans are so fundamentally different they 
cannot be combined he said shatalins plan would be presented to 
the russian supreme soviet at the session opening monday it 
closely follows a plan endorsed by yeltsin earlier 
the national supreme soviet convenes sept 10 
people are tired of waiting yeltsin said seated amid a sea 
of microphones in front of the blueandred russian republic flag 
people are at the limit of patience therefore they 
expressed such very sharp dissatisfaction with the actions of the 
union government which for five years did practically nothing in 
economic reform 
he said he got a sense of public reaction during a 
justcompleted 22day tour of 27 cities in the russian republic 
if the russian federation goes its own way on economic reform 
it would immensely complicate gorbachevs efforts to unify a 
country already fractured by ethnic conflicts yeltsins government 
already has moved to seize control of banking in russia from soviet 
authorities and he said it could start implementing an overall 
economic reform program on oct 1 
yeltsin believes ryzhkovs plan would maintain the central 
governments command system which he blames for aggravating the 
countrys economic problems if implemented it would lead to a 
collapse he said 
he said any plan adopted is doomed to fail unless ryzhkov and 
the ministers under him resign gorbachev himself is at risk 
yeltsin said 
every day the union government takes away from confirming this 
plan it diminishes gorbachevs term he said 
after government advisory bodies met for two days to discuss 
economic reform gorbachev said friday that the government will try 
to stabilize the faltering economy within six months by cutting off 
soviets ability to accumulate hot money that is the term for 
income derived from black marketeering and other activities 
ryzhkovs initial program presented in may and rejected by the 
national legislature a month later called for drastic price 
increases on bread and other items whose prices have remained 
basically unchanged for decades 
the program fueled panic buying that left illstocked store 
shelves even barer

after three weeks of staying well 
south of saudi arabias northern border with iraq us troops are 
moving north to bolster defensive lines and vastly improve their 
offensive capabilities 
the movements of several us units last week were described as 
a logical extension of the american military buildup as more and 
more us firepower flows into the region 
us officials said the movements were noteworthy because they 
signaled that us commanders are comfortable putting troops a good 
distance from major supply points 
if nothing else it shows we believe we are now capable of 
sustaining a significant force in forward positions said a 
senior air force officer in dhahran he spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
marine maj gen john hopkins said saturday the marine force in 
saudi arabia now about 15000 strong would be tripled within 
two weeks 
we are right where we should be if the flow continues well 
be at full combat power in two weeks hopkins told a visiting 
delegation of us senators 
us officials say more than 100000 troops including those 
aboard dozens of ships are in the persian gulf region or on the 
way 
until last week the united states would have been almost 
entirely dependent on air firepower to counter an iraqi invasion of 
saudi arabia most ground forces were in positions about 200 miles 
from the saudikuwait border 
we needed to have the troops down at the ports and air base 
to provide security for the ships and transports planes as they 
arrived in country a top aide to a senior us military official 
said also on condition of anonymity 
as the airlift brought more and more troops and supplies to the 
kingdom us military planners began shifting the deployment to the 
north with most units setting up initial staging camps about 100 
to 150 miles from the border 
but last week marine and at least two army units moved even 
farther north in the case of the marines to within 35 miles of the 
kuwait border 
the marines members of the 7th marine expeditionary brigade 
have taken up positions behind the saudi forces closest to the 
border from those positions they could defend the northsouth 
highway that iraqi tanks could use to reach the richest of saudi 
arabias oil fields 
a bit farther south the mechanized 24th infantry division began 
to establish a forward base for its heavy ground forces which 
include m1 tanks and bradley armored infantry carriers the m1s 
arrival last week gave american commanders their first shipment of 
the united states heaviest ground power 
they give us a cushion make it more comfortable for us to 
move up because we know the troops have heavy support an army 
officer said 
to the west of those positions the 101st airborne divisions 
air assault brigade has established its first forward refueling and 
rearming base according to brigade officers 
several other potential sites for refueling and rearming camps 
have been identified and more forward camps likely will be 
established in the next few weeks the officers said 
additional heavy and light army infantry are arriving in saudi 
arabia or are due to arrive within days even more heavy equipment 
is in the early stages of its sealift which takes two to four 
weeks still more is waiting in the united states to be shipped 
here 
although the forces moving north have offensive capabilities 
us commanders here said it is unlikely the united states would 
use saudibased forces to initiate combat if a decision to attack 
was made 
but if hostilities did erupt regardless of which side initiated 
them us forces now are in positions from which they could engage 
iraqi ground forces far more quickly than they could have a week 
ago they said 
were not looking to start anything but we are looking to be 
ready when it starts the senior military aide said

an official commission issued 
a stinging report saturday saying police fired without reason on a 
protest march killing five blacks and wounding 156 the report 
recommended a criminal investigation 
the report into police conduct at the sebokeng township march 26 
was one of the harshest criticisms of police conduct ever made by 
an official inquiry it said the marchers never threatened the 
police and officers fired without orders 
the attorney general should investigate policemen who fired 
bullets for possible criminal action said the report which was 
authored by justice rj goldstone it gave no indication what 
charges might be filed if action is taken 
police displayed an attitude of unconcern for the lethal 
nature of their ammunition this is an attitude which no 
police force should tolerate the report said 
it was released at a time when police are under attack from the 
african national congress church groups and others for alleged 
bias and improper conduct in black factional fighting around 
johannesburg 
law and order minister adriaan vlok who supervises police said 
saturday that the case would be turned over to the attorney general 
for investigation he also said there may be a police investigation 
the anc said at least 12 people were killed in the shootings at 
the sebokeng township south of johannesburg the march was to 
protest local housing conditions rents and other grievances 
the report said one officer fired and others joined in when a 
mostly peaceful crowd tried to march to a police station 
at most the behavior of the crowd may have justified the use 
of tear gas and then only after a proper warning to disperse 
the report said 
there appears to be no credible evidence to suggest that the 
behavior of the crowd was such that the policemen could have 
reasonably been in fear of their lives or personal safety 
there was a complete lack of discipline in the police line 
this was the direct cause of the shooting into the crowd 
a white civilian carrying a pistol joined the police unit and 
took part in the incident the report said 
but it said no evidence emerged of criminal action on the part 
of capt du plooy the police commander on the scene who was 
sitting in a vehicle at the time such a finding would make it hard 
to prosecute other officers involved 
president fw de klerk ordered the inquiry following public 
outrage over the shootings 
in another development peter mokaba leader of the south 
african youth congress charged saturday that the government 
instigated black factional fighting he called for disbanding the 
whiteled police and army and denounced de klerk despite his 
efforts to end apartheid 
south africa can have peace only when the whiteled government 
is removed he said at a funeral in tokoza township near 
johannesburg for four people killed in black factional battles 
police fired tear gas at protesters who tried to march through 
tokoza after the funeral and protesters hurled rocks no injuries 
were reported 
government and police have rejected anc charges of police bias 
during fighting last month in johannesburg between xhosas and other 
blacks linked to the anc and zulus tied to the conservative 
inkatha movement 
at least 518 people have been killed in the fighting which 
began aug 12

here is a transcript of president 
bushs announcement saturday of a oneday meeting next week with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and of the questionandanswer 
session that followed 
bush well have a brief announcement that id like to make and 
that is that president gorbachev and i will meet on sunday sept 9 
in helsinki to discuss international and bilateral matters i spoke 
with president koivisto of finland this morning and i believe the 
soviets made a similar approach to president koivisto to secure 
the final arrangements 
secretary of state james a baker and foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze have been working out the details of this 
meeting over the last few days and we got word this morning that 
an announcement at this time would be agreeable to the soviets 
so i wanted to get that out and im looking forward very much 
to seeing mr gorbachev again we have many matters to discuss 
there is no special agenda relating to the middle east nobodys 
doing any negotiating or anything of that nature when president 
gorbachev was here he and i agreed that it would be useful to have 
periodic meetings without casting them in the vein of a summit and 
thats exactly what this meeting is about and i will be delighted 
to see him again and we have many subjects to discuss 
q mr president this is a little bit sudden can you tell us 
what you hope to i mean it seems sudden on such short notice 
what do you hope to accomplish and also was this your 
initiative or his 
bush its not overly sudden we just havent been discussing 
it and its i believe in this case i made the suggestion that we 
have this meeting at this time and at this place

q what do you hope to accomplish 
bush well being sure were together as you know ive been 
very pleased with the cooperation weve been getting from the 
soviet union on a wide array of questions and subjects and i think 
it is important at this juncture that we discuss issues not just of 
as they relate to europe and try to update where we stand on 
these arms negotiations but also to discuss the middle east 
q mr president is this at all motivated by concern that the 
soviets either dont understand or dont agree with us actions in 
the gulf region specifically the military deployment that theyve 
expressed some doubt 
bush no ive im very pleased as i think i said before 
publicly we seem to be in general agreement on a lot of issues a 
lot of questions that relate to the middle east but it is my view 
that its just important that we have good freeflowing 
discussions about this so its not a it wasnt driven by any 
worry that we might be apart rather that theres a wide array of 
questions that could use consultation at this time 
q why you havent talked to president gorbachev until now 
and since 
bush because id anticipated seeing him 
q have you talked to him about the summit meeting 
bush no 
q mr president given the 
bush but ive been in direct contact with him about the summit 
meeting personally yeah sandy

military advisers out of iraq

advisers right now sandy yeah

bush well i hadnt i mean weve just set these meetings up 
and the way i described it from our side to him was that wed like 
that wed have no agenda and that it would be freeflowing 
discussions but i know that well have discussions of as i 
mentioned cfe and a cfe agreement would lead to the csce 
meetings so i think well be talking about all of these things 
sandy yes 
q mr president what role would you like to see the soviets 
play in the burdensharing campaign that the administration has 
started 
bush well i dont know that they have a have a role to play 
in burdensharing at all 
q why 
bush i the soviet union is have a lot of responsibilities 
around the world if they want to help in the burdensharing 
thats fine but i dont go there with a specific burdensharing 
role in mind it should be disconnected from the mission that 
secretary baker and secretary of treasury nicholas brady are 
undertaking 
it has put it this way this meeting in my view is not about 
burdensharing 
we may get a better idea of all of this because i think jim 
baker will be in moscow very soon 
q mr president given the soviet relationship with iraq do 
you see moscow playing a mediating role in the crisis in the gulf 
bush i dont see a mediating role at all and i dont think the 
soviets see themselves having a mediating role there are a lot of 
mediators out there trying hard un secretary general de 
cuellar being in the forefront of this 
i talked today to the president of yemen from up here who 
thinks theres some chance for some mediation and so its fine for 
them to go forward but i dont think the soviets see themselves in 
a mediating role and i dont intend to ask them to see themselves 
in a mediating role nor do i expect him to ask the united states 
to be in a mediating role 
q you said last week that you didnt foresee at that point a 
diplomatic settlement of this problem has your view of that 
changed

the un secretarygeneral and iraqs 
foreign minister appeared close to agreement saturday on a plan to 
prevent a clash between iraqi and us forces in the persian gulf 
jordanian sources said 
although secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar and foreign 
minister tariq aziz expressed only general optimism after ending 
two days of talks senior jordanian officials described substantial 
progress 
if approved by the governments involved the plan could free all 
foreigners held in iraq deploy an arab peacekeeping force as a 
buffer between us and iraqi troops along the saudi border and 
eventually resolve the status of kuwait the officials said 
the soviet union might help mediate simultaneous withdrawals of 
iraqi troops from kuwait and opposing forces in saudi arabia they 
said 
before leaving for the airport saturday night aziz said as 
far as i see it the talks were very fruitful 
but he added this situation is complicated and dramatic and 
cannot be resolved by dramatic diplomacy it needs patience it 
needs time and people to understand exactly the positions 
perez de cuellar scheduled a news conference for sunday 
also saturday the white house announced that president bush and 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev will meet in helsinki 
finland on sept 9 
jordanian officials close to the talks here said the un chief 
and the iraqi minister worked on how to immediately lessen tensions 
in the region 
one official who like the others spoke to the associated press 
on condition of anonymity said perez de cuellar delivered a 
peaceful message from bush to iraqi president saddam hussein 
aziz said of his talks with perez de cuellar i listened to 
him very carefully and told him about our situation and the ways 
and means to reach the common goals we share which are peace 
and stability in the region 
bush demands that iraq leave kuwait and restore the deposed 
royal government saddam wants to link his withdrawal from kuwait 
with an israeli pullout from the occupied territories and a syrian 
pullout from lebanon 
perez de cuellars talks with aziz lasted far longer than 
originally scheduled they took place as jordans king hussein was 
in germany on the eighth stop of a 10nation tour to seek peace 
both perez de cuellar and aziz met with prince hassan husseins 
brother and regent to discuss jordans initiatives for an arab 
buffer force and a negotiated solution principally among arabs a 
palace official said 
perez de cuellar and aziz met privately then with aides on 
friday and decided to meet again saturday 
at a news briefing friday night the secretarygeneral described 
saddams promise to release foreign women and children as an 
important step forward but he added from my point of view 
this is not enough 
aziz said all foreigners could leave men included if the 
united nations could produce guarantees that the united states 
would not attack 
iraqs ambassador to the united states made a similar offer last 
week but washington said it rejected any conditions for releasing 
hostages 
iraq has detained about 21000 westerners including 3000 
americans since overrunning kuwait

bush well i havent seen any flexibility on the key point 
which is the operating within the united nations mandate 
ive listened carefully and follow up as carefully as we can on 
various conversations that saddam hussein has and what the world 
community has said is to get out of iraq and to out of kuwait 
and to restore the rulers and now you see the arab league acting 
and calling for reparations but on for saddam hussein to make 
good on reparations but i dont see any willingness on his part 
to undertake what the world community is looking for so id like 
to be optimistic and i think its fine to have these talks going 
on 
i encouraged javier perez de cuellar and told him i wished him 
great success but i dont want to mislead the american people by 
saying that i think theres some breakthrough at hand or some 
flexibility that is clearly going to be required on his part to 
live within the mandate of the united nations 
q sir what do you make about of the piecemeal approach that 
saddam has been taking releasing a few women and children 
bush i dont like that yeah i dont like it i dont like it 
i dont think the world likes it im glad when any american comes 
out of there but theres a certain brutality a certain tawdry 
performance in all of this 
q what do you think his motive is in handling it that way 
bush well i cant anticipate his motive but it is just 
turning off world opinion it is so base and so outrageous that i 
think most people in the arab world are very embarrassed by this 
and i think thats certainly true of others around the world 
ive talked to so many leaders and they all agree that this is 
this is just a despicable performance 
q how long can you let it go on sir 
bush well i dont ive not wanted a deadline i dont 
deadlines ive got to 
q mr president can you tell us when you first broached this 
idea of a meeting with mr gorbachev 
bush over a week ago maybe or something like that

mikhail s gorbachevs desire for a ussoviet 
summit next sunday stems from concern about the buildup of us 
troops near his borders and his desire to bolster his countrys 
flagging superpower status 
gorbachev says he is campaigning for a diplomatic rather than a 
military solution against iraq not because his country has become 
weaker but because it conforms to his new thinking the 
approach that underlay arms agreements he has signed with the 
united states 
some people think we lose our prestige and reputation by 
advocating peaceful means to force an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait 
he told a news conference on friday 
it is not so i think that everything will depend on whether 
we are successful in using political measures he said 
by pushing for a peaceful solution said angela stent of 
georgetown university gorbachev is calculating that the soviets 
will emerge from this with a stronger international position 
even in the middle east where the kremlin has lost ground to the 
united states over the last decade 
it remains unclear what led to the decision to hold a summit at 
a time when the soviets seem to be sitting on the superpower 
sidelines the announcement came after a visit to moscow last week 
by white house chief of staff john sununu ostensibly he was in 
town as part of a longscheduled program to impart us management 
skills to the soviet executive branch 
soviet cooperation with washington in the current crisis has 
reduced the dangers for the bush administration vastly diminishing 
the threat of a global war resulting from any conflict involving 
the us troops in saudi arabia 
overall however gorbachev seems poised to gain more than bush 
from the summit he is swamped with political trouble at home and 
he has come under public pressure from his military for guarantees 
that us troops will be withdrawn from the gulf once the crisis 
has passed 
the soviet commander of the warsaw pact gen vladimir n lobov 
was quoted last thursday by the state news agency tass as warning 
that the presence of so many us troops in saudia arabia less 
than 700 miles from the soviet border could alter the strategic 
balance 
he said the buildup could derail talks in vienna aimed at 
reducing troops stationed in europe by the warsaw pact and the 
north atlantic treaty organization 
deputy foreign minister alexander belonogov told a parliamentary 
committee that because of the military buildup the situation is 
becoming more and more explosive and there are no guarantees that 
the united states will leave saudi arabia after the crisis is 
settled 
gorbachev responded friday that i dont think that the us 
leadership after political solutions to this conflict have been 
found will preserve its force in saudi arabia 
i believe that when a solution has been found we will be able 
to provide guarantees he said and i believe that the sooner 
we have a military detente after that the more calm we all will 
feel 
gorbachev and his generals clearly would feel better if bush 
stated such guarantees publicly in helsinki where the sept 9 
summit will take place 
the benefit may be greater for gorbachev in the short term than 
in the long term as the soviets become increasingly preoccupied 
with their crumbling economy and ethnic unrest that is altering the 
shape of the nation 
the world has changed greatly since the middle east war of 1973 
when the white house ordered a nuclear alert opening us missile 
silos to demonstrate support for israel against arab nations 
including iraq which were armed and backed by the kremlin 
since then the soviets have lost their empire in eastern 
europe signed arms control pacts with the united states mended 
fences with china and taken steps to open diplomatic relations with 
israel 
they are in retreat said adam ulam of harvard university 
if we had had this crisis four or five years ago the soviets 
would have been prudent but they would have been issuing grave 
warnings to the united states 
although the soviets are siding with the united states their 
support has been lukewarm 
the kremlin has backed a un security council resolution that 
iraq withdraw its invasion forces from kuwait stopped its own 
substantial arms shipments to the government of saddam hussein and 
said it expects to lose 880 million in trade for its actions 
but so far the soviets have balked at joining the american 
naval blockade against iraq 
and although the kremlin halted its arms shipments to iraq it 
has not withdrawn 193 soviet military specialists and 5000 
construction workers stationed there it also pulled its diplomats 
out of kuwait rather than keeping there in defiance of saddam 
husseins order to leave

although he was acquitted the trial of 
an army sergeant charged with killing a civilian during the us 
invasion of panama has left some soldiers with doubts about using 
deadly power 
it would make me hesitate sgt gina nixon said friday after 
the military jury announced the verdict just look at the all the 
things hes gone through to prove his innocence 
master sgt roberto enrique bryan 43 a paratrooper with 19 
years in the army was found innocent of unpremeditated murder or 
voluntary manslaughter in the death of a wounded unarmed 
panamanian 
ted sampley publisher of us veteran news and report said the 
courtmartial has caused irreparable damage to the morale of 
combat soldiers combat soldiers must not hesitate in the face of 
the enemy the publication set up a defense fund for bryan 
the message is one of confusion sampley said what is a 
combat soldiers exact role now should he be a police officer and 
worry about human rights or is he a soldier conditioned to inflict 
deadly casualties on the enemy 
in the dec 23 1989 episode bryans unit stopped a carload of 
five panamanians at a roadblock a grenade was tossed and the 
soldiers opened fire killing four of the men 10 american soldiers 
were injured by the grenade 
the fifth panamanian man was injured bryan shot and killed him 
a short time later under circumstances that were at issue in the 
trial 
the prosecutions case rested on the testimony of 1st lt 
brandon thomas who said bryan shot the man without provocation to 
avenge the soldiers injured in the grenade explosion a prosecutor 
capt charlie luckey called it a battlefield summary execution 
witnesses supported bryans contention that the man made 
threatening moves and testified that thomas did not see the 
shooting 
luckey said the defense witnesses who testified they saw the 
panamanian make a threatening motion all missed something 
were all soldiers and we all know we kill the enemy but 
were all soldiers and we all know when the enemy is shot up and 
wounded and no longer a threat we all know hes no longer a 
combatant lucky told jurors 
bryans unit along with most of the 82nd airborne division from 
the base has been deployed to saudi arabia the soldiers still on 
post friday said they would have reacted as bryan did 
probably under the same circumstances i would have done the 
same thing said master sgt don gouldsmith 
bryan proved by his actions that he was willing to put his 
soldiers welfare first regardless of what the outcome was you 
dont find that everyday its indicative of a good leader 
gouldsmith said 
sgt david mclean said he could only hope that the courtmartial 
didnt cause soldiers in a combat situation to hesitate 
stop and think about shooting and you might not be around 
he said 
at least three other us soldiers have been prosecuted for 
their actions during the panama invasion one was convicted of 
unpremeditated murder and two others were found guilty of lesser 
charges

a delegation of us senators on 
saturday brought mail and words of support to us troops in saudi 
arabia and two said the middle east crisis had changed their views 
on sales of us arms to the saudis 
the 14member delegation received a 30minute briefing from the 
commander of american forces in the middle east army gen h 
norman schwarzkopf before heading to a number of american base 
camps in northeast saudi arabia 
were going to get rid of saddam hussein and then well bring 
you guys home carl levin dmich told one group of soldiers 
senator david durenberger rminn said that the longer the 
standoff dragged on the greater the risk for the iraqi president 
senator alan cranston dcalif said schwarzkopf told the 
senators the us mission remained a defensive one and that no 
attack on bagdhad is planned for now 
cranston a strong supporter of israel who has opposed past 
sales of hightech us arms to the saudis said the current crisis 
had convinced him we should make available what they need 
i was the leader of the opposition but not any more 
cranston said of military sales to the saudis now they are 
allied with us they are sitting on the front lines they will take 
the first casualties 
another fierce defender of israel in the senate new york 
democrat daniel patrick moynihan said he too was convinced the 
saudis now are deserving of further us military equipment 
several senators said they wished more nations would join in the 
multinational defense force 
i would like to see some of the western european nations being 
more supportive said senator john glenn an ohio democrat 
glenn the former astronaut rode in the cockpit of a c130 
hercules transport plane for one leg of the trip 
the senators took notes from soldier constituents and promised 
to contact families back home they also brought boxes of mail and 
words of support 
the leader of the delegation senate foreign relations committee 
chairman claiborne pell arrived with three boxes of mail aides 
said the boxes contained 600 pieces of mail from pells 
constituents in rhode island 
the saturday visit was the second by a congressional delegation 
eight senators came earlier in the week and a third is due 
sunday a group of us congressmen visited sailors saturday aboard 
the uss la salle 
if the troops were looking for word on when they might be coming 
home they were disappointed 
glenn said the international squeeze play was taking its 
toll but how long it takes nobody knows anywhere from six 
weeks to six months and beyond

president bush said saturday that he 
and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev will meet next sunday in 
helsinki finland for a freeflowing oneday summit on the 
middle east crisis and other issues 
the third summit between the two leaders was announced 
simultaneously here where the president was wrapping up a 25day 
vacation and in moscow 
we have many matters to discuss bush said adding there was 
no agenda for the meeting he said he proposed the meeting and 
gorbachev accepted 
while bush sought to lower expectations that the summit might 
help resolve the middle east standoff the meeting was portrayed by 
administration aides as symbolically important if only as a show of 
ussoviet solidarity against iraqs saddam hussein 
moscow has been iraqs chief arms supplier and there are 
currently soviet military advisers there 
bush said he and gorbachev seem to be in general agreement 
over the crisis even though soviet support for military action in 
the gulf has been lukewarm he said he did not see the soviets 
acting as a mediator in seeking to persuade saddam to withdraw his 
troops from kuwait 
the president asserted several times that matters other than the 
middle east would be discussed at the summit 
he said that among a wide array of questions that could use 
consultation at this time is progress on an agreement to reduce 
conventional forces in europe both leaders have voiced a hope that 
the treaty can be signed later this year at a 35nation summit 
however administration officials have said that while the talks 
are on track in terms of reducing troops there have been recent 
hangups on artillery and aircraft reductions 
bush said he would take his wife barbara to helsinki and that 
raisa gorbachev was expected to accompany the soviet president the 
trip also is expected to give bush a chance to try out a new air 
force one a modified version of a boeing 747 that was delivered 
just last week 
bush has had two previous meetings as president with gorbachev 
last december on the mediterranean islandnation of malta and in 
late may and early june in washington gorbachev also met five 
times with former president reagan 
dressed in a light tweed sports coat bush answered reporters 
questions on his way to a round of golf the president was to 
return to washington on monday 
he said it was his gut instinct to ask congress to forgive 
some of egypts 67 billion military debt to the united states as 
a gesture of appreciation for its support in the current crisis 
asked what he hoped to accomplish at his summit with gorbachev 
bush said being sure were together it is my view that it 
is just important that we have good freeflowing discussions about 
this 
the soviet union voted in favor of a un security council 
resolution authorizing the use of force to impose sanctions on 
iraq but it has voiced reservations about the usled naval 
blockade 
moscow has stopped arms shipments to iraq but nearly 200 soviet 
military advisers and 5000 construction workers remain there 
although bush has spoken by phone with dozens of world leaders 
about the middle east crisis he has not talked directly to 
gorbachev since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
he said this is because he had hoped he would be meeting the 
soviet leader 
bush was to spend saturday night in helsinki in advance of the 
allday sunday session aides said that bush did not plan to visit 
any other countries on the trip 
although bush stressed several times that there was no 
agenda press secretary marlin fitzwater said they both know 
what they want to talk about 
a lot has happened since the two of them met before not only 
in the persian gulf said national security adviser brent 
scowcroft 
he mentioned cambodia and afghanistan as other areas that needed 
superpower attention 
as for the soviets acting as mediator in the crisis bush said 
i dont see a mediating role at all and i dont think the soviets 
see themselves as having a mediating role there are a lot of 
mediators out there trying hard 
he mentioned un secretary general javier perez de cuellar as 
being in the forefront of this 
perez de cuellar conferred saturday with the iraqi foreign 
minister in amman jordan senior jordanian officials said the 
meeting produced some progress toward reaching an agreement that 
could free all foreigners held in iraqi deploy an arab 
peacekeeping force as a buffer between us and iraqi troops along 
the saudi border and eventually resolve the status of kuwait 
as he had done before bush voiced pessimism over chances for a 
diplomatic breakthrough 
i havent seen any flexibility on saddams part he said 
asked about saddam husseins piecemeal release of some women and 
children bush said i dont like it im glad when any 
american comes out of there but theres a certain brutality a 
certain tawdry performance in all of this 
ive talked to so many leaders and they all agree that this is 
just a despicable performance 
aides said bush suggested a meeting last week in a diplomatic 
cable to gorbachev that was followed by two phone conversations 
between secretary of state james a baker and soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze fitzwater said 
fitzwater said that the very fact that bush and gorbachev were 
meeting to discuss the middle east could increase pressure on 
saddam once again it shows world unity in opposition to saddam 
hussein he said

here is a comparison of two soviet economic plans 
according to the newspaper trud and the sept 2 edition of the 
weekly moscow news one plan was being prepared by the government 
of premier nikolai ryzhkov and the other from a working group 
headed by stanislav shatalin a member of mikhail s gorbachevs 
presidential council advisory group

prices 
ryzhkov plan prices would be raised at once perhaps by as 
much as two to three times by administrative decree with a 
later gradual transformation to market prices hardesthit groups 
such as the elderly and nonworking mothers would get compensation 
shatalin plan the market not administrative decree would 
determine prices on many goods there would be gradual increases in 
wholesale prices of energy prices would be frozen on about 100 to 
150 basic goods and services for the entire transition period 
after that the prices of 70 percent to 80 percent of the goods 
would be freefloating rationing is not ruled out and social 
assistance would be provided 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
privatization of businesses and property 
ryzhkov plan longterm denationalization of businesses and 
property the state would control at least 50 percent of shares in 
most industries 
shatalin plan state control over businesses and property would 
end with the private sector prevailing in most industries some 
property would be sold at low or symbolic cost to labor 
collectives leasing might be possible as would be private family 
property but the republics would determine some forms of ownership 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
budget financing 
ryzhkov plan reliance on taxation for income 
shatalin plan strict control on state spending measures for a 
sounder ruble reform of the banking system 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
central controlequals 
ryzhkov plan strongly resembles the present system in that the 
central government still would maintain major control determining 
what its own powers should be and leaving residual powers to the 
republics the central government could reduce its powers if so 
inclined 
shatalin plan economic union would be on a voluntary basis the 
sovereign republics together would decide what powers the central 
government should have

a redfaced national security 
adviser brent scowcroft who usually does not preside over news 
briefings should have followed his instincts saturday 
as the white house aide was on camera refusing to confirm press 
reports of a new ussoviet summit presidential press secretary 
marlin fitzwater was on the telephone at the other end of the room 
being told by president bush and secretary of state james a baker 
iii that the summit was on 
fitzwater hustled up to where scowcroft was still saying he 
would not be able to confirm that a summit was in the offing

stay tuned scowcroft told reporters well have an 
announcement at one oclock then wryly you know i knew i 
shouldnt have done this

america and its allies may wish to see 
saddam hussein go but iraqi exiles say no one is in sight to 
replace him and without a strongman in charge iraq could explode 
into an orgy of bloodletting 
saddam has managed to crush any successor and any opposition 
out of existence there are no charismatic leaders waiting in the 
wings to take over if something happened to saddam a senior 
member of the patriotic union of kurdistan in london said in a 
telephone interview 
for years saddam has moved against the opposition in iraq and 
outside the rebellious kurds are still active but they have been 
badly mauled by the iraqi presidents legions 
you could call it the romania of the middle east one 
londonbased iraqi emigre said 
but no one expects a popular romaniastyle uprising in iraq and 
a palace coup presents its own problems 
after years of maneuvering himself to a position of power 
saddam knows how to guard his flanks 
since he invaded kuwait aug 2 reports from baghdad say saddam 
has been moving constantly between underground bunkers 
reports from stockholm a week ago said a swedish company had 
built 14 installations under baghdad equipped with filters against 
nuclear radiation and poison gas during iraqs 198088 war with 
iran 
for years saddam has systematically removed anyone who opposed 
him or appeared to be gaining power 
his inner circle is made up mostly of relatives from his home 
village of takrit in northern iraq all became wealthy supporting 
him 
they know that when saddam goes they go said a former 
iraqi army officer now living in london so whos going to pull 
the trigger 
like all iraqi political exiles interviewed by the associated 
press he spoke on condition of anonymity citing fear of reprisals 
against his family in iraq 
estimates of how many iraqis have fled in the past 20 years 
range from 500000 to 3 million 
they represent all shades of political opinion but all keep a 
low profile fearing saddams long reach 
his wrath has been felt by dissenters and members of enemy 
groups communists prosyrian members of the ruling baath party 
kurds and proiranian shiite moslems 
saddam is a sunni moslem the minority sect which dominates 
iraqi politics 
iraqis took refuge in dozens of countries one of the largest 
communities was in kuwait before the invasion 
iraqis in western europe say hundreds of exiles were quickly 
rounded up and taken to baghdad what befell them is still a 
mystery 
like the romanians when nicolae ceaucescu fell iraqis might see 
the end of saddam as a signal to exact revenge on thousands of 
informers and militiamen 
there will be a bloodbath these people have been subjected to 
so much brutality it is beyond anger said an exile from a small 
village in northern iraq 
exiles say a military coup would be the only way to get rid of 
saddam but saddam has ousted senior officers who became too 
popular or voiced dissenting opinions and has reportedly crushed 
several coup attempts 
even if there were a coup it would be hard to find an iraqi 
face presentable to the people and the west said an iraqi 
engineer living in paris everyones been tainted by saddam 
possibilities include nizar hamdoun a deputy foreign minister 
and former ambassador in washington taha yassin ramadan a member 
of the ruling revolution command council izzat ibrahim saddams 
chief deputy and foreign minister tariq aziz the only christian 
in saddams cabinet 
the fear is that a dictator will emerge to replace saddam 
possibly armed with nuclear weapons produced by the ambitious arms 
program now under way

a fairskinned redheaded scottish 
woman arriving in jordan on saturday with thousands of arab and 
asian refugees said she was smuggled out of kuwait by her husband 
a professor at kuwait university 
patricia fido a native of edinburgh scotland is the wife of 
professor abdullah fido 
she stood at the ruweishid border post saturday as sharply 
defined as a lighthouse in fashionable european dress surrounded 
by a mass of robes sarongs and dhotis at the oncesleepy border 
post now a sprawling refugee camp 
i was smuggled out by my husband she declared 
fido had accompanied his wife and three sons ages three to 11 
on a 36hour voyage across the desert from kuwait through baghdad 
to ruweishid 
he did not reveal how he got his redheaded wife out of iraq he 
also did not specify his own nationality 
a senior border official said mrs fido was the only westerner 
among the 10000 people mostly arabs and asians who came through 
the frontier saturday 
fido acknowledged relief at finally escaping iraq 
we were lucky to get out but many of our friends are 
suffering he said 
his wife asked whether their friends in kuwait city were in 
hiding said no but they are keeping a low profile very 
lowkey staying in their homes and not going out 
the familys large green mercedes was piled high with 
belongings hundreds of cars with white kuwaiti plates streamed 
through the border post at a steady rate most had piles of luggage 
balanced on the roof with more bundles and families of up to seven 
or eight people crammed inside 
thousands more people egyptians indians bangladeshis 
pakistanis filipinos and thais camped under tents made of 
bedsheets amidst growing piles of litter 
the stench from garbage and poor sanitary arrangements is such 
that many evacuees walk around with pieces of cloth tied around 
their faces like surgical masks 
most are waiting for their embassies to complete arrangements 
for their journeys home 
we are doing the best we can under the circumstances said 
the border official who spoke on condition he not be identified 
he said the flow of refugees had slowed considerably since early 
in the week 
many of those arriving saturday appeared to be more affluent 
people with a goodly number traveling in expensive cars those in 
private vehicles were quickly cleared and continued to amman 
many penniless families have waited up to five days for 
clearance to enter jordan only to wait again for evacuation to 
their homelands

despite president bushs assertion that the 
amount of goods reaching iraq through jordan has been reduced to a 
trickle a new state department report says there is still 
heavy traffic using that route in defiance of united nations 
sanctions 
food supplies and other goods still are transiting jordanian 
highways obviously destined for iraq the report said 
numerous tractortrailers and other trucks were moving east from 
jordan to iraq 
state department officials said the report was completed 
thursday the same day bush told a news conference that commerce 
between jordan and iraq has come down to a bit of a trickle 
at another point bush acknowledged that he was unable to give 
the precise quantity involved in the crossborder traffic 
during their meeting two weeks ago bush said jordans king 
hussein offered him assurances he would comply with the embargo 
but the washington post in its saturday editions said the bush 
administration was sending a special envoy to tell hussein not to 
expect any emergency financial aid from the international community 
until he cuts off the remaining crossborder traffic 
at the same time administration officials said they were 
considering forgiving egypts 67 billion military debt to the 
united states egypt is one of a handful of countries which has 
sent troops to saudi arabia in support of the us military buildup 
the new york times said in saturday editions that officials were 
considering providing israel with f16 and f15 fighters apache 
antitank helicopters and patriot groundtoair missiles that could 
be used against attacking missiles the package also could include 
m60 tanks 
administration officials said no final decisions have been made 
bush would not comment on the possibility of forgiving egypts 
debts when asked saturday in kennebunkport maine but he told 
reporters his gut instinct was to make such a recommendation to 
congress 
bush said he wants to work with egyptian president hosni mubarak 
to alleviate egypts grave financial problems 
the onepage state department report on compliance with 
sanctions made available to the associated press was an update on 
efforts to circumvent the economic embargo that the united nations 
authorized against iraq early last month 
the report said syria has not prevented some smuggling of 
agricultural products into iraq but that truck traffic via iraqs 
northern neighbor turkey was very limited 
the report also said iraq was continuing to shop actively on the 
west european market for other goods including military and 
militaryrelated equipment there were reports friday that iraq has 
offered the philippines an oilforsugar deal 
bush has staked the success of his policy on an effective global 
economic embargo against iraq contending that widespread 
deprivation in iraq eventually will force iraqi president saddam 
hussein to withdraw his forces from kuwait 
an earlier state department update on the sanctions said libyan 
planes have flown a number of cargo aircraft into baghdad an 
indication that iraq may increasingly rely on air transport as a 
means of avoiding interception of sea shipments 
yemen also has been cooperating with the iraqis unloading iraqi 
oil at aden 10 days ago in violation of the sanctions the report 
said 
the washington post said saturdays that iran also was being 
eyed by smugglers as a potential conduit for sending goods to iraq 
iran is on record in support of the sanctions but would have 
difficulty policing the long border between the two countries 
the washington times reported this past week that cuba and north 
korea are flying militaryrelated equipment to iraq 
still the administration is pleased with what it regards as the 
widespread international compliance with the embargo 
deputy treasury secretary john e robson called the 
international compliance unprecedented georgetown university 
economist clyde hufbauer described it as amazing 
one measure of the effectiveness of the sanctions is that iraq 
reportedly introduced a rationing system on saturday 
coupon books entitle each iraqi to a monthly allocation of 13 
pounds of flour 33 pounds of rice 22 pounds of sugar 35 
ounces of tea 11 pounds of oil 17 ounces of detergent and one 
bar of soap sources said 
children under one year of age receive three cans of powdered 
milk each month but older children receive none fresh fruit and 
vegetables from summer crops remain plentiful the sources said

about 100 americans many married to kuwaitis crossed the line 
here to freedom 
many stayed at the khafji beach hotel on the arabian gulf before 
moving on 
but the iraqis have dug up the road with bulldozers making it 
impassable even to fourwheeldrive vehicles said a us state 
department official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
now the only escape routes from kuwait are across the 
treacherous and scorching desert 
its completely different from the situation in midaugust 
said the us official 
at the border post bored saudi customs agents say only one or 
two cars a day have passed through recently 
allahgul and two friends were injured early last month when 
their car crashed while fleeing kuwait they each spent five days 
in a saudi hospital near the border 
he said the saudis promised to take him to riyadh the capital

a memorial to nazi war deserters was unveiled 
in goettingen on saturday while activists gathered on the former 
death strip in berlin during events to mark the anniversary of 
the outbreak of world war ii 
ironically the day noting the 1939 nazi invasion of poland also 
coincided with tougher rules for poles and other former east bloc 
citizens seeking to visit west berlin 
in one of the few events to acknowledge the anniversary the 
first official west german monument to those who fled the nazi army 
was dedicated in goettingen about 110 miles northeast of frankfurt 
goettingen mayor artur levi said men who deserted the nazi 
military were unfairly forgotten and whose love for the 
fatherland knew no limits the granite memorial contains a 
mutilated swastika a symbol of the nazi regime 
in berlin several hundred church environmental and peace 
activists gathered on potsdamer platz a former main square in 
prewar berlin that was reduced to the barren death strip after 
the berlin wall was erected 
the group laid the cornerstone of a building they hoped would be 
called european house devoted to peaceful cooperation between 
european nations 
a small group of peace activists also rallied in the east german 
city of weimar the center of german culture in the 18th and 19th 
centuries the weimar republic named for the city governed 
germany from the end of world war i until the rise of nazism in the 
1930s 
on saturday tougher west berlin visa requirements for eastern 
european residents went into effect 
visitors now must have a written invitation from somebody living 
in the city a hotel reservation and adequate amounts of western 
currency 
west berlin has been the only western city where poles could 
travel with no restrictions they converge on the city in large 
numbers to buy goods scarce in their country 
we are going to protest and defend polish citizens rights 
with all means we have said polish foreign ministry spokesman 
witold gruszka in warsaw on saturday 
the rules were approved by the united states france and 
britain which still have final say over many of the laws passed in 
west berlin 
the german states are scheduled to be united oct 3 when the 
former world war ii allies are to give up their special rights to 
berlin 
also saturday east german defense minister rainer eppelmann was 
quoted as saying that soviet troops should leave the country more

a new un peace plan for cambodia has 
again raised hopes for ending the civil war but many past efforts 
have failed after initial optimism 
the five permanent members of the un security council on 
tuesday proposed a un interim administration in cambodia until a 
new government is elected they envisaged deploying up to 20000 
un personnel including a peacekeeping force to bolster a truce 
and guide the nation to democracy 
the vietnameseinstalled communist government of premier hun sen 
is battling a guerrilla coalition composed of the communist khmer 
rouge and two noncommunist groups one headed by former head of 
state prince norodom sihanouk and the other by former premier son 
sann 
all sides welcomed the un plan and signaled willingness to 
hold talks to discuss it in detail 
but they have made no concessions on longstanding differences 
meanwhile fighting has increased as both sides have reported big 
battles for control of western and central areas during the current 
rainy season 
one diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity called the 
proposal a breakthrough because it was endorsed by britain china 
france the soviet union and the united states which back 
different parties in the war they are the permanent members of the 
security council 
china the guerrillas main backer said conditions had been 
created for a political settlement and the time is right for a 
settlement 
us officials at the united nations tried on friday to persuade 
vietnamese diplomats to back the un plan 
the same day the vietnamese government said the new plan went 
in the right direction in the search for an overall fair and 
reasonable political solution 
but outside efforts cannot succeed without the approval of the 
cambodian factions each time they have neared breakthroughs in the 
past they later retreated to their old positions 
in tokyo in june sihanouk and hun sen signed a document saying 
they wanted a supreme national council formed that would arrange 
the first truce in the war and act as an interim body before 
elections the council would comprise representatives from the 
government and rebels 
but the agreement collapsed quickly fighting continued and the 
khmer rouge insisted it have the same number of council seats as 
the hun sen government 
both sides expressed willingness to attend talks that indonesia 
is trying to arrange for this month indonesia has played host at 
three rounds of cambodian peace talks since 1988 
the un plan calls for five key ministries to be placed in un 
hands but the government and the guerrillas have long disagreed on 
the extent of the un mandate 
phnom penh wants to retain power in the interim period the 
guerrillas want either the united nations or the supreme national 
council to have interim power 
phnom penhs deputy prime minister hor nam hong welcomed the 
un plan but did not indicate his government would concede on the 
issue of interim power 
however in remarks quoted by the official news media on 
saturday he accepted the major role played by the united nations 
during the transitional period notably the right to organize free 
and fair elections 
certain important ministries may be supervised by the united 
nations so that the elections can take place in a neutral political 
environment he said 
phnom penh previously rebuffed the united nations because it 
recognizes the guerrilla coalition as cambodias government 
in july however in a major policy shift the united states 
said it would no longer back the guerrillas un seat washington 
also said it would consider opening direct talks with the cambodian 
government 
the civil war began after vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 
ending a rule of nearly four years of the khmer rouge under the 
khmer rouge hundreds of thousands of people died of famine in 
executions and slave labor camps

from a businessmans office saturday in a search for a federal 
prosecutors secret computer files that were mistakenly sold for 
45 
charles hayes owner of challenger ltd said federal marshals 
and staff from the us attorneys office in lexington seized nine 
computer terminals a computer memory device and other equipment 
from his office in nancy about 70 miles south of lexington 
hayes said he bought a broken computer system from the us 
attorneys office in lexington after he took possession of it the 
government realized a technician failed to properly erase the 
computers memory 
as a result sensitive details about fbi informants federally 
protected witnesses and sealed grand jury indictments and court 
records were released inadvertently to hayes 
hayes said he was trying to find the records the fbi wanted and 
would have turned them over anyway he called the ninehour search 
of his offices that ended early saturday the action of desperate 
men 
hayes company buys government surplus equipment for resale to 
the public some of the computer equipment was sold and hayes said 
hes trying to get the customers to return the items 
but he has refused to identify the customers which made 
government investigators suspicious 
officials with the us marshals office in london ky the 
us attorneys office in lexington and the us justice department 
in washington dc could not be reached saturday for comment 
the justice department filed suit thursday in london demanding 
hayes return the computers immediately the government also wants 
hayes to testify about who purchased the equipment or had access to 
the data 
if made public the sevenyears worth of secret files could 
ruin ongoing criminal investigations and cause great harm and 
irreparable injury to the work of federal prosecutors according 
to the lawsuit 
us district judge eugene siler jr granted the governments 
request in a temporary order and scheduled a hearing tuesday siler 
also signed the search warrant executed friday evening said hayes 
hayes contends he doesnt know which computers came from the 
us attorneys office because the equipment was mixed in with 
similar inventory

a sharply divided minnesota supreme court has 
ruled that a landlord did not violate the states human rights act 
when he refused to rent to an unmarried couple 
the court on a 43 vote that reversed a state court of appeals 
decision ruled friday that layle french did not discriminate on 
the basis of marital status when he refused to rent to a woman who 
planned to live with her fiance whom she eventually married 
it is simply astonishing to me that the argument is made that 
the legislature intended to protect fornication and promote a 
lifestyle which corrodes the institutions which have sustained our 
civilization namely marriage and family life associate justice 
lawrence yetka wrote for the majority 
before abandoning fundamental values and institutions we must 
pause and take stock of our present social order millions of drug 
abusers rampant child abuse a rising underclass without 
marketable job skills and children growing up with no one to 
guide them in developing any set of values yetka wrote 
the landlord french 34 of marshall contended that the ruling 
against him violated his constitutional rights to freedom of 
religion and to due process of law his attorney argued that french 
upheld a state law against fornication 
in the ruling yetka said at the very least before the state 
imposes sanctions on french it must repeal the fornication 
statute 
however chief justice peter popovich wrote in dissent that 
this is not a case involving discrimination against fornicators 
rather it is a case involving discrimination against single people 
living together 
popovich also questioned the constitutionality of the 
fornication law 
the state claimed that because french was a landlord in a 
secular setting his religious beliefs were subject to the states 
prohibition against housing discrimination 
in june last year an administrative law judge ruled that french 
violated the states antidiscrimination law when he reneged on an 
agreement to rent a house to sue parsons in february 1988 
parsons intended to live in the house with her boyfriend whom 
she later married french said it would violate his religious 
beliefs to rent to the couple before they wed 
french said he paid parsons 348 because he broke an oral 
contract to rent her the house he later paid a 700 civil penalty 
in 1 bills as a protest 
a threejudge panel of the state appeals court last october 
unanimously upheld the discrimination finding 
it said the government may subject the practice of religion to 
reasonable regulation if there is an overriding compelling 
interest 
in frenchs case the panel said the interest was eliminating 
discrimination

until the wall came down in november freyers world ended at 
pariser platz and the gate which stands on the line dividing the 
city 
we never had to worry about what happened over there he 
said pointing at an empty white area denoting west berlin on his 
wall map now our task is to get the city to grow together 
again 
to freyers delight his job often takes him to the 
onceforbidden zone to work with west berlin planners on reviving 
the central district much of which is in east berlin and went to 
seed during four decades of communism 
less than 10 months after the wall opened berlin is booming an 
influx of 13 million east germans has brought its population to 
34 million 
planners dont know how many billions of dollars will be needed 
to rebuild the city but expect the process to last a decade

west berlin was an outpost of democracy in a sea of communism 
so many people fled to it from surrounding east german territory 
that the communist regime built the berlin wall in 1961 to keep 
them in 
the wall builders disregarded streets and subway lines creating 
an artificial strip through the city 
its a unique situation freyer said a building boom will 
occur to fix what happened due to the division

buildings in the citys historic center

iraqi authorities have pressed into service 
elderly iraqis to patrol kuwait city and blown up public buildings 
to instill fear in kuwaitis said an indian refugee who arrived in 
amman on saturday 
meanwhile a new yorkbased human rights monitoring group 
middle east watch issued a statement expressing concern about the 
conduct of iraqi troops toward kuwaitis and nonwesterners inside 
occupied kuwait 
the group said it had interviewed scores of kuwaitis arabs and 
asians who had fled to other middle east countries following the 
aug 2 invasion 
middle east watch said hundreds of people arrested by iraqis 
shortly after the invasion remain unaccounted for including 
kuwaiti army officers government officials and iraqi dissidents 
the group also said iraqi troops fired on peaceful 
demonstrations opposing the occupation killing or wounding several 
kuwaitis but middle east watch said it could not provide the 
number of casualties 
harinder pal singh an indian national who ran an air 
conditioning business in kuwait for 13 years said he had witnessed 
abuses by iraqi troops singh fled kuwait earlier in the week and 
arrived in amman on saturday 
singh said uniformed and armed iraqis at least 70 years old were 
patrolling the streets of kuwait city 
i dont know whether it works or not but with a gun everyone 
is afraid he said 
in kuwait there is no law and order he said 
middle east watch said the iraqis were using members of the 
popular army a poorly trained government militia for occupation 
duty in kuwait after the aug 2 invasion the iraqis moved some 
regular army units into positions near the border with saudi 
arabia where a massive us troop buildup is under way 
the refugee said officers had little apparent control over their 
troops and he described incidents in which iraqis kidnapped 
foreign women 
they are especially interested in filipino girls he said 
it happened in front of my friends 
singh said soldiers manning roadblocks routinely steal personal 
items from the occupants of cars 
if he sees your watch he will ask for it and you cant do 
anything about it he said 
he said the iraqi soldiers apparently do not have enough food or 
water and were foraging wherever they can 
middle east watch said the widespread looting that marked the 
early days of the invasion has been curbed in part by the swift and 
wellpublicized punishments meted out to suspected looters some 
people taken into custody for looting have reportedly been executed 
singh said that some days gunfire could be heard in kuwait city 
as the iraqis skirmished with kuwaiti resistance fighters he said 
the iraqi occupiers regularly destroyed public buildings with 
artillery and tank fire 
theyll go to an important place and destroy it with a tank as 
if they want to put their stamp on each and every position he 
said 
at the turkish border outpost of habur a pakistani refugee who 
arrived with his wife and two children saturday complained that 
iraqi soldiers were robbing departing foreigners 
ashfaq ahmed who worked in a factory in kuwait said his family 
and hundreds of other pakistanis in cars had to wait for 10 days at 
the border before being allowed by the iraqis to cross into turkey 
ahmed said the iraqis took most of his belongings including a 
camera television set and a radio 
they stole everything everything all our money cigarettes 
and even my trousers he said pointing to the long robe he was 
wearing 
we had to bribe the officials at the border to let us 
through he said

commands radioed 152 million miles 
across the solar system saturday made the errant magellan 
spacecraft easier to control as it orbits venus nasas jet 
propulsion laboratory said 
engineers have not determined why the spacecraft has suffered 
two long communications blackouts but were hopeful that its 744 
million mission to map the planet with radar would begin this month 
controllers began sending commands to magellan early saturday to 
awaken it from a socalled deepsafe mode and put it in a state 
called random access memory control 
nearly six hours after beginning the series of orders the lab 
received magellans confirmation of the new configuration 
radio signals take 27 minutes 10 seconds to travel from earth 
to venus and back venus is earths closest planetary neighbor 
magellan appeared to be stable its solar panels were properly 
pointed at the sun and its batteries were charged the lab said in 
a statement 
the new condition will allow flight controllers to more easily 
program magellans computers in addition data from magellan can 
tell engineers more about the spacecrafts condition said jpl 
spokesman jim doyle 
next week engineers will do more to normalize the spacecrafts 
operation if that goes without a hitch magellan would be ordered 
on sept 12 to send home radar data already stored on its tape 
recorder and its radar sensor would resume operation two days later 
magellan was launched from the space shuttle atlantis in may 
1989 and made a looping 15month 948 millionmile journey to 
venus 
the spacecraft entered orbit around the cloudshrouded planet 
aug 10 and things began to go wrong the radio link from magellan 
to earth failed for 14 hours starting aug 16 and for 17 hours 
beginning aug 21 
controllers put magellan into deepsafe mode which kept its 
solar array pointed toward the sun so its batteries would stay 
charged 
other spacecraft have passed near venus but they returned 
images far less detailed than magellan can produce 
images of venus sent by magellan after an aug 16 test of the 
radarmapping system showed extensive seismic faults enormous 
flows of solidified lava cinder cones a meteorite impact crater 
filled with lava and innumerable valleys and mountain ridges 
the national aeronautics and space administration had originally 
planned for magellan to begin its mapping survey by the end of 
august

debby and jerry willis of parkman maine 
nearly succeeded in their escape across the border from occupied 
kuwait into saudi arabia 
but iraqi soldiers caught them in the desert now mrs willis 
is finally released but her husband remains behind in iraq as a 
hostage at a military site to deter a possible us attack 
trapped in kuwait by the aug 2 iraqi invasion the willis lay 
low and then sought refuge in the us embassy after two weeks 
with iraqi troops closing in they decided to make a run for the 
border 
friends had told us to get false passports and go out with 
poles or other foreigners but we did not want to do that mrs 
willis said on saturday at the baghdad airport finally on her way 
home on a flight with hundreds of other western women and children 
in their attempt to escape the couple had headed out across the 
desert for saudi arabia in a fourwheel drive vehicle 
however they could not find any local guides willing to take 
the risk to help them instead on their own they tried to follow 
an old water course 
nearly at the border they passed an abandoned vehicle but an 
iraqi patrol leaped out of it and ordered them to halt 
we did not resist said mrs willis one of the western 
women allowed to leave after iraqi president saddam hussein said 
only foreign men would be detained 
mrs willis was a lawyer in kuwait her husband who is 
originally from johnson city tenn had come looking for a job 
just before the iraqis invaded 
they were captured on aug 25 more than three weeks after the 
invasion 
iraqi officials stole everything from us cameras jewelry 
even jeans and tennis shoes from the men mrs willis said but 
she said she wasnt afraid until they took away her husband 
willis remains in iraq apparently housed at a potential

fifteen years ago the cold war began 
to defrost when 35 world leaders met in this capital to sign the 
helsinki human rights accords 
now the leaders of the two superpowers will use the city as a 
site to try to solve the latest threat to world peace the persian 
gulf crisis 
washington and moscow confirmed saturday a summit between 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev will be 
held in helsinki on sept 9 
finnish president mauno koivisto said finland is ready to 
host the meeting and he welcomed the two world leaders 
since the 1975 helsinki accords foreign leaders have found this 
city a useful stopover to hear finnish leaders views on soviet 
affairs 
koivisto was the first western leader to meet gorbachev after he 
became soviet communist party leader in 1985 
previously koivisto had held talks with three other soviet 
leaders leonid brezhnev yuri andropov and konstantin chernenko 
he has now met gorbachev more than 10 times 
us leaders also have shuttled through helsinki numerous times 
since gorbachev came to power in may 1988 president reagan paid 
his respects to finnish diplomacy in a speech at finlandia hall 
the site of the signing of the helsinki final act 
america respects finlands neutrality and we salute the 
creative statesmanship that has been finlands gift to world 
peace reagan said before meeting gorbachev in the soviet capital 
during a threeday state visit in october 1989 gorbachev also 
made a longawaited gesture by acknowledging finnish neutrality 
more explicitly than any soviet leader before 
but finlands position has not alway been understood by the rest 
of the world 
after 100 years of russian rule and two bitter wars against the 
soviet union from 193944 finland adopted a cautious neutral 
foreign policy that is now being held up as a model by reformers in 
the baltic states and others in the soviet sphere 
that policy sometimes derogatorily called finlandization to 
indicate subservience to a larger power is now paying off 
finland retained its independence unlike its southern neighbors 
estonia latvia and lithuania which the soviet union annexed in 
1940 
finland is the only nation to have soldiers in all un 
peacekeeping duties worldwide and has contributed the most troops 
overall

whatever the agenda the specter of next 
weekends snap ussoviet summit underscores the isolation of 
iraqi president saddam hussein and serves as a dramatic diplomatic 
move that could bring the soviet union deeper into the embrace of 
the noncommunist world 
we have many matters to discuss president bush told 
reporters in maine he held out hope for agreement with mikhail 
gorbachev on a longawaited conventional forces treaty to cover 
troop and tank reductions in europe 
bush sought to dampen expectations that the meeting could 
somehow break the hostile impasse in the middle east he put the 
gulf crisis somewhere in the discussions but not necessarily at the 
center 
be that as it may theres something in helsinki for everyone 
among the nations involved in the middle east faceoff with the 
notable exception of saddam hussein 
for bush it is a key step in sealing the remarkable 
international coalition that has developed to reverse iraqs 
invasion of kuwait and protect the middle eastern oil fields from 
iraqi piracy 
the meeting would restore an element of the postcold war amity 
that had been rolling across the globe before iraq sent its tanks 
into kuwait on aug 2 
for gorbachev still struggling to tame the soviet economy and 
the restless soviet republics it provides a spectacular stage to 
practice the safer craft of foreign diplomacy in his continuing 
bid for western aid he can send a signal that moscow can be a 
reliable partner in crisis management 
there were reports from amman that moscow might mediate the 
withdrawal of iraq from kuwait before the invasion of kuwait 
moscow was a longstanding ally of saddam providing iraq with its 
most sophisticated weaponry and military advisers to make it work 
bush seemed to dismiss that out of hand i dont see a mediating 
role at all for moscow he said 
gorbachev is leery of the us military buildup in saudi arabia 
and presumedly would relish an agreement that would return 
everyones military to their own borders it cant make red army 
generals happy to see us troops deployed sidebyside arab troops 
in the saudi desert 
whatever role gorbachev may play his role in the antiiraq 
coalition is a far cry from the brezhnev era when the soviets 
began largescale military support for saddam and could be counted 
on to blast any americanled military or diplomatic initiative 
for egypt saudi arabia syria and other arab nations involved 
in the antiiraq effort soviet participation provides cover from 
criticism that they are too willing to do american bidding soviet 
acquiescence in the antiiraq effort has been important all along 
but the fact is that gorbachev himself has pretty much kept his 
distance 
in the midst of the military crisis in the gulf bush said 
thursday that events in the middle east might lead to a new 
postcold war world order he might have been referring to hopes to 
keep intact the antiiraq alliance that includes almost all the 
states of the united nations including nations that have been 
enemies for years 
for james a baker iii it promises a sort of resurrection hes 
been on vacation while national security adviser brent scowcroft 
and defense secretary dick cheney took center stage on us policy 
in the gulf crisis 
but a distinct success has slowly emerged from this crisis the 
diplomatic efforts to forge an international opposition to iraq 
and vacation or not baker has to have been a central figure 
senior us officials said only baker and scowcroft worked on 
the bushgorbachev meeting 
asked why bush and gorbachev would get together scowcroft said 
a lot has happened since the two of them met before in 
washington in may and june not only in the persian gulf he 
said he mentioned cambodia and afghanistan and added there is 
no lack of things for the two of them to talk about 
notably there is arms control in fact two big treaties 
continue to wave in the winds the conventional forces cfe 
agreement for europe and a pact that would cut back strategic 
nuclear missile levels 
weve just set these meetings up and the way i described it 
from our side to him gorbachev was that wed have no agenda 
and that it would be freeflowing discussions 
but i know that well have discussions of as i mentioned 
cfe and a cfe agreement

an emotionally troubled university of 
florida freshman under scrutiny in the grisly murders of five 
college students had a strong attraction for one of the slain 
women a former neighbor said 
edward lewis humphrey who was arrested thursday for beating his 
grandmother but is a suspect in the murders lived briefly this 
summer at the gatorwood apartments where the bodies of tracy 
paules 23 and her roommate manuel taboada 23 were found 
humphrey had a major crush on tracy said rachel olivier 
22 who also lived at the apartments hed fall over himself to 
be near her or to help her hed go and sit by the pool and watch 
when shed come out 
humphrey also lived for a short time at tolbert hall a 
dormitory where victim christina powell 17 lived during summer 
school 
the other stabbing victims were 18yearold sonja larsen and 
christa hoyt 18 four of the victims were students at the 
university of florida taboada at santa fe community college 
humphrey 18 of indialantic continues to be a very good 
suspect for the moment said police spokeswoman lt sadie 
darnell but we have other good suspects about a dozen in all 
she said 
darnell cautioned that the killings might not all be linked to a 
single suspect the killer may still be at large she said and 
people should remain on guard 
we cannot say the killing is over we dont know we dont 
have anyone in custody for the murders she said 
among other suspects she mentioned warren virgil tinch 58 an 
ohio fugitive wanted for the mutilation stabbing death of a woman 
in that state someone matching his general description stole cars 
in gainesville and ocala a week before the murders 
humphrey remained jailed saturday in brevard county central 
florida on 1 million bond on a charge of assaulting his 
79yearold grandmother authorities have interrogated him at 
length about the gainesville murders and taken blood samples but 
no additional charges have been filed 
brevard county sheriff jake miller and neighbors described 
humphrey as a troubled youth who suffered an auto accident two 
years ago in which he fell or threw himself from a car moving at 
over 60 mph 
he has been taking the moodstabilizing drug lithium said randy 
moore chief felony attorney with the brevard county public 
defenders office which is representing humphrey lithium is often 
used to treat schizophrenics 
i think there is a question about his sanity moore said 
he acts like he is out of it 
both prosecutors and moores office have said they likely would 
seek a psychological evaluation of humphrey this week 
police sealed off the youths gainesville apartment and 
questioned anyone entering the complex but darnell said no attempt 
has been made to obtain a search warrant and examine the apartment 
itself a move that would require investigators to convince a 
judge there was good reason to suspect humphrey 
that would be the normal course of any investigation and we 
have not reached that point yet she said 
most of the university of floridas 34000 students took 
advantage of the long labor day weekend to head for the beach or 
home said school spokesman larry humes 
between top 40 hits radio stations kept broadcasting the latest 
news on the killings and urged people to have a fun labor day 
but also a safe one one station asked people to tie white 
ribbons in front of their homes to remember the dead

california lawmakers rejected a 
proposal to move up californias presidential primary from june to 
march after stumbling over the issue of whether the primary ballot 
should be stripped of voter initiatives 
the planned shift would have put californias primary in the 
first week of march hard on the heels of the iowa caucuses and the 
new hampshire primary it failed to go to a vote late friday when 
assembly members rejected a constitutional amendment that would 
have stripped all other ballot measures from the presidential 
primary ballot 
a fragile compromise worked out by supporters of the early 
primary depended on legislative approval of both the amendment and 
the main bill but it fell apart just hours before the end of the 
1990 legislative session 
they may try to bring it back next year but i doubt it 
said sen ken maddy the senates gop leader and the author of the 
proposed amendment frankly i dont see a groundswell of support 
for it except from some insiders and political reporters 
supporters say the shift would change the california election 
from an afterthought into the nations dominant early primary 
now one of the latest in the nation the california primary 
hasnt had a real impact on a presidential nomination race since 
1972 when george mcgoverns victory here cleared the way for his 
democratic nomination 
the early primary proposal would have left a separate primary 
for congressional legislative and other races in june but under 
californias constitution voter initiatives that were ready would 
have to go on the same ballot as the presidential primary 
both parties were concerned that a onesided primary or one 
that drew especially strong voter interest for one party could 
skew the results of ballot proposals 
since initiatives in recent years have included major issues 
like the proposition 13 property tax cuts a cigarette tax hike and 
major insurance education and environmental measures that raised 
the possibility of major policy issues being decided principally by 
voters of only one party 
to avoid that maddy tied the early primary bill to enactment of 
a constitutional amendment that would bar initiatives from the 
presidential primary ballot 
but while the early primary bill required only a simple majority 
vote of the senate and assembly maddys constitutional amendment 
required a twothirds majority 
after several assembly roll calls the vote for maddys bill was 
47 to 25 seven short of the required majority in the 80seat lower 
house 
maddy said lawmakers were unsure about the effects of moving to 
a march primary even if his amendment had passed the lower house 
maddy said the assembly may have wanted to sit on the bill until 
next year 
the early primary proposal faced stiff opposition in the senate 
where the democratic leader president pro tem david roberti of los 
angeles opposed maddens constitutional amendment 
the problem is what to do with the initiatives roberti 
said he said he prefer leaving them on the ballot in march and 
november because thats when we will have the biggest turnout

canadian troops backed by armored vehicles 
and helicopters saturday swept into a mohawk community where armed 
indians and authorities have stared at each other across barricades 
for 53 days 
gen armand roy commander of the canadian forces 5th brigade 
said he decided to send in his troops after two mohawk men were 
wounded in factional fighting behind indian barricades set up in a 
land dispute with government officials 
i decided to move my troops so as to guarantee the security of 
civilians and my soldiers roy said 
the military action came after efforts failed to reach a 
negotiated settlement in the dispute the mohawks have been trying 
to block a golf course extension on land they claim is theirs but 
they have also raised other grievances 
one shot was fired into the air by a mohawk after the troops 
moved in the canadian broadcasting corp said but there were no 
reports of casualties 
defiant indian militants stood their ground and screamed at 
canadian soldiers to get away as troops pushed to within 100 yards 
of the mohawks main barricade saturday afternoon 
the troops moved into an area where the army had estimated at 
least 50 armed members of the militant mohawk warriors society 
were located 
later in the evening ltcol pierre daigle said the army was 
digging in for the night around two other barricades 
im willing to die for this one warrior screamed at a 
soldier approaching the main barricade are you ready to die but 
before i die im going to take out 50 of you 
ellen gabriel a mohawk negotiator denounced the army action as 
illegal she said some mohawk children had been caught in the path 
of the advancing troops 
the army move was so fast they didnt have a chance to get the 
children out she said in a radio interview from behind the 
barricades at the settlement 
journalists were not being allowed into the kahnesatake indian 
settlement overlooking the village of oka 18 miles west of 
montreal 
the troops backed by provincial police had also surrounded the 
mohawk community center where about 75 indian civilians were 
gathered the center has been used to house a food bank run by the 
indians 
provincial authorities monday had given the military the 
goahead to end the armed standoff that began july 11 when the 
quebec provincial police attempted to storm a mohawk barricade at 
oka one officer was killed but it is still not clear by whose 
gunfire 
later that day fellow mohawks set up a blockade in sympathy at 
the mercier bridge a major link between montreal and its southern 
suburbs 
the ostensible reason for the mohawk uprising expansion of the 
golf course was settled when the federal government purchased the 
land and said it would turn it over to the indians but militants 
seized the situation to publicize a much wider range of indian 
grievances against the government including demands for 
sovereignty 
quebec provincial police identified the two wounded mohawks as 
chief francis jacob and his son corey 
the two were severely beaten with baseball bats by four or five 
members of the warriors society early saturday morning police 
said jacob who had two black eyes and his son were later 
released from the hospital 
dan david a journalist who lives in the mohawk settlement said 
the factional fighting was sparked by an incident friday evening in

portauprince haiti ap election officials saturday 
postponed general elections that had been planned for november 
delaying efforts to bring democracy to haiti 
a statement by the independent electoral council said the nov 4 
election date was washed up it cited a shortage of money and 
equipment 
the council did not set a new election date but said it would be 
held in time to inaugurate a president by the feb 7 1991 that 
date previously planned for the inauguration will be the fifth 
anniversary of the flight of dictator jean claude duvalier 
baby doc duvalier son of francois papa doc duvalier 
was swept from power in a popular uprising and fled to france in 
feb 1986 his father ruled from 1957 
the statement said the opening date for a threeweek 
voterregistration period had been moved from sept 3 to oct 5 due 
to lack of funds and materials the statement was signed by council 
president jeanrobert sabalat 
the last attempt at free elections in haiti in 1987 collapsed 
when thugs supported by the army killed at least 34 voters 
we have already set up the district bureaus and most local 
bureaus but we cannot begin registration insufficiently 
prepared electoral council member emmanuel ambroise said the 
nov 4 date for elections is just impossible 
many of the 12000 registration bureaus have not been set up 
the council has said that it has only received 400000 of the 
26 million it needs to complete registration 
in past statements the council has said it would call off the 
election if not enough people register to give credibility to the 
next regime 
electoral council executive secretary patrick tardieu said the 
postponement had nothing to do with a standoff between president 
ertha pascaltrouillot and the council of state which governs with 
her 
on thursday the council of state asked election officials not 
to rush headlong into elections saying minimal security 
conditions had not been established by the executive branch 
on aug 14 the council of state broke off relations with mrs 
pascaltrouillot because of alleged abuse of power and refusal to 
satisfy demands for administrative reform law and order and 
economic relief 
seven of the 12 political parties that appointed mrs 
pascaltrouillot provisional president in march have called for her 
resignation they have asked the electoral council to postpone 
registration until the conflict has been solved 
on sept 11 the united nations will consider a haitian 
government request for technical and security assistance for 
elections including supervision of voter registration and 
balloting

columbias astronomy mission is off 
until late this week so nasa can fix a link to one of the 
telescopes aboard the shuttle 
the space agency had hoped to launch columbia and its 150 
million astro observatory as early as wednesday but engineers 
determined saturday that the problem could not be corrected as 
easily as hoped and said the earliest date would be thursday 
the communication problem between astros xray telescope and 
launch control was the latest in a series of flaws that have dogged 
nasa for months 
nasa has not launched a shuttle since april when discovery 
carried the flawed hubble space telescope into orbit that is the 
largest gap between flights since after the 1986 challenger 
accident 
at nasas jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena calif 
scientists have been working to control the errant magellan 
spacecraft in orbit around venus commands were radioed across the 
solar system saturday to improve control of the magellan which has 
suffered two long communications blackouts 
at cape canaveral nasa officials said the latest columbia delay 
was not viewed as serious 
one day is not going to make that much of a difference to the 
team its not the first time its happened said lisa malone 
spokeswoman for the national aeronautics and space administration 
theres always a chance youre going to have some kind of 
delay whether its weather or something on the orbiter or 
something on the payload which is what we have here she said 
the countdown for a saturday liftoff was halted thursday night 
after contact was lost with astros xray telescope workers 
entered the cargo bay friday to examine a unit linking the 
instrument with the orbiter and launch controllers 
controllers need to be in constant touch with the xray 
telescope before launch to monitor the pressure and temperature of 
argon a chemical used to keep the scientific instruments cool 
engineers decided saturday they could not restore communications 
by installing a new cable in the unit a sort of electronic box 
but would try replacing a component inside the box that channels 
signals between the telescope and launch control if that doesnt 
work the whole box will be replaced 
workers on saturday also replaced an instrument that measures 
acceleration and vibration the instrument failed to activate 
properly during the countdown 
four of the crew members are astronomers who will operate 
astros three ultraviolet telescopes during the nine to 10day 
flight probing some of the hottest objects in the universe the 
xray telescope will be managed by ground controllers the 
observatory will remain aboard the shuttle 
the astro mission was first scheduled for march 1986 but the 
challenger disaster two months earlier put the flight and all 
others on hold 
after a series of minor delays the mission was rescheduled for 
may 30 excessive amounts of hydrogen leaked during fueling 
however and the flight was called off 
another shuttle atlantis was found to have similar leaks a 
month later prompting nasa to ground the entire threeshuttle 
fleet new fuel lines were installed in columbia and the shuttle 
was moved back to the launch pad last month atlantis launch has 
been rescheduled for november 
columbia must lift off before sept 14 or will have to wait 
until after discoverys flight in october with the sunprobing 
ulysses satellite

pope john paul ii on saturday 
rebuked iraq for its occupation of kuwait but said military action 
by usled forces could bring more evil to the persian gulf 
everything possible must be done to avoid a bellicose 
solution the pope told reporters on a flight from rome to 
tanzania at the start of a 10day african tour 
the pontiff said kuwaits existence and rights must be 
respected 
in other comments in tanzania the pontiff opened his seventh 
trip to africa by urging the world community to help solve two of 
the continents gravest problems aids and the crush of refugees 
the lifegiving functions of human sexuality and the blood 
which epitomizes health and life itself have become a roadway to 
death he said 
in his remarks on the gulf crisis the pope expressed concern 
about the possibility the united states and its allies might resort 
to armed confrontation against iraqi president saddam hussein 
whose troops invaded kuwait aug 2 
naturally every war creates worry in its various aspects 
the pope said 
many things in history have been resolved through war but on 
the other hand war brings with it more violations of human rights 
and more evil than good or solutions 
the pope would not say whether the vatican would formally 
condemn a military strike against iraq 
the pontiff encouraged a diplomatic settlement citing the 
united nations as the best forum 
we try not to lose hope we pray for this and there are talks 
going on about this he said 
it would be reasonable for the iraqis to understand this 
approach by the international community and to collaborate said 
the pope who noted there are no plans or proposals for the vatican 
to act as a mediator in the crisis 
last sunday in his first direct public comments on the gulf 
crisis the pope decried the grave violations of human rights and 
of the un charter he did not mention iraq by name 
in his other remarks the pope called for a global effort to 
wipe out aids but he also made clear the church rejects the use of 
condoms as a means of checking the spread of the deadly disease 
in a speech to diplomats john paul described aids as a 
terrible evil which threatens all of humanity 
the aids epidemic calls for a supreme effort of international 
cooperation on the part of governments the world medical and 
scientific community and all those who exercise influence in 
developing a sense of moral responsibility in society the pope 
said 
he warned that the aids crisis could be aggravated by 
indifference discrimination against aids sufferers and rivalries 
among scientists seeking a cure 
john paul also directed his attention to the plight of africas 
millions of refugees 
most are innocent victims of ethnic conflict power struggles 
or failed development policies he said the situation cries 
out for urgent intervention on the part of the international 
community 
the pope will spend five days in tanzania before traveling to 
the tiny neighboring countries of burundi and rwanda he ends his 
tour sept 10 in the ivory coast

a federal appeals court friday refused to 
order the environmental protection agency to install new curbs on 
the precursors of acid rain to benefit canada 
the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia 
said the eap could study the issue further 
the case could be close to moot since congress is expected to 
order new measures against the precursors of acid rain chiefly 
sulfur and nitroggen oxides emitted by utility and other 
smokestacks in revisions to the clean air act expected to pass 
this fall the united states and canada have begun negotiations on 
a treaty to deal with the issue 
half of acid rain falling in eastern canada originates in the 
united states much of that from the industrial areas of the 
midwest and central atlantic states 
the province of quebec sued epa more than two years ago in an 
attempt to force the epa to act canada contents that 14000 of its 
lakes are endangered by acid rain which can turn lakes in 
sensitive soil areas so acidic that no fish can live 
just before president reagan took office outgoing epa 
administrator douglas costle wrote secretary of state edmund muskie 
that the us pollution in question was harming canada 
quebec supported by new brunswick ontario nine northeastern 
us states and several environmental groups argued in court that 
costles letter constituted a determination under us law that 
required action against offending pollution sources 
the us environmental agency countered that it was not trying 
to stall a pollution cleanup but needed more time to identify 
specific remedial actions and sources 
a threejudge panel of the appeals court agreed and said the 
agency had the right to wait until the completion of a massive 
scientific study on acid rain commissioned by congress 10 years 
ago the hundreds of scientists involved in the study are expected 
to release their final report in december 
the epas delay in action on the plaintiffs petitions has 
been neither arbitrary nor capricious nor contrary to law the 
court said in its ruling 
in us federal administrative law courts generally may 
overturn decisions in an agencys area of expertise only if those 
decisions can be shown to be arbitrary capricious or otherwise 
contrary to law

the 3600 black soldiers who endured 
frostbite mosquitoes and the unsetting summer sun to build the 
alaska highway nearly 50 years ago also were never recognized for 
their work two professors say 
now a reunion is being organized for the soldiers who made up 
about a third of the force that built the highway and it will 
take place in the far gentler florida clime 
were going to try to have a conference here so that all those 
black troops that want to stay warm and be comfortable instead of 
going to alaska can celebrate their part of the construction 
said james n eaton curator of the black archives research center 
and museum at florida aampm university 
but first eaton and lael morgan a journalism professor at the 
university of alaska in fairbanks who contacted eaton for help 
have to find the soldiers who were ignored in accounts of the 
highways construction 
theyve put the word out through military and construction 
magazines and black newspapers and interviewed their first two 
veterans thursday 
i think that its a very interesting project alexander 
powell one of the two vets told reporters friday maybe well 
get our due recognition 
powell a softspoken 68yearold man born and raised in quincy 
just west of tallahassee was shipped to alaska in april 1942 
before the army transferred him to the south pacific 16 months 
later he had lived with winter temperatures that dropped to 70 
degrees below zero a summer sun that never set mosquitoes black 
bears almost no recreation and a lot of hard work 
but he was chuckling as he talked about his part in building the 
road 
it was a nice healthy country powell said i didnt have 
a cold the sniffles or anything while i was up there 
other soldiers werent so lucky most units reportedly lost at 
least one or two soldiers morgan said 
with all that cold it would come back up to 30 or 35 below 
and it would actually feel warm to you then powell said 
morgan has been researching the eightmonth construction of the 
1200mile alaska highway for two years she said she was amazed to 
learn that about a third of the 10000 soldiers who built the 
highway which is still the only road that links alaska to the rest 
of the united states were black 
you go through all the souvenir books of the alaska highway 
and all the old news clippings you never see a single black 
face morgan said nor did any historian know the whereabouts 
of any of these people so i started looking 
she turned for help to eaton because many of the black soldiers 
were believed to have come from florida and south georgia and 
because of the reputation of the archives at florida aampm the 
states only historically black public university 
eaton said theyd like to hold a reunion at the school in late 
1991 so that it can be taped and taken to alaska for the 50th 
anniversary he and morgan also want to make a traveling exhibit of 
photographs and memorabilia

peruvian writer and politician mario vargas 
llosa said mexico ruled by one party for 60 years is the 
perfect dictatorship newspapers reported friday 
a spokesman for the ruling institutional revolutionary party 
claimed the novelist had lost touch with reality during his 
years of residence in paris 
the perfect dictatorship is not communism is not the soviet 
union is not fidel castro it is mexico vargas llosa told a 
conference of intellectuals thursday evening in the mexican capital 
it is the dictatorship camouflaged in such a way that it can 
seem not to be a dictatorship but in fact it has all of the 
characteristics of a dictatorship not of a man but of a party 
added vargas llosa 
the novelist who ran a strong but unsuccessful race this year 
for the presidency of peru was referring to the party that has 
ruled mexico since 1929 
he said the party was immovable a party which concedes enough 
space to criticism on the level at which that criticism serves it 
because it confirms it is a democratic party 
but vargas llosa said the party suppresses that criticism 
which in some way endangers its permanence 
his remarks were carried by the governments notimex news 
agency as well as by several leading mexico city dailies 
the conservative el heraldo and the leftist la jornada carried 
the story on the front page 
the governments el nacional included the remarks in the fourth 
column of a story on page 16 of its arts and culture insert 
vargas llosa said that the ruling partys leftist rhetoric 
stemming from the 19101920 revolution was the most efficient in 
latin america at recruiting intellectuals but he said mexicos 
suffered from the same social injustices as most countries in the 
region 
later friday the partys secretary for international affairs 
romeo flores caballero ripped back at vargas llosa in a statement 
carried by the independent excelsior news agency 
the official said vargas llosa had lived in paris so long he had 
lost touch with his own countrys history as well as mexico 
if he knew the history he would have won in the recent 
elections in peru flores said 
the agency quoted another party official parliamentary deputy 
augusto gomez villanueva as claiming vargas llosa was seeking 
notoriety because of his failure in the peruvian elections

with psychologist l jerome oziel were to have been released to 
prosecutors and the public sept 4 but on thursday the court 
ordered the tapes sealed until it decides whether to grant a 
hearing on the disclosure issue a decision that could take three 
months 
prosecutors want to use statements in the tapes as evidence 
against the brothers who have denied the murders 
conversations between patients and therapists during treatment 
normally are confidential but can be disclosed in some 
circumstances when a patient has threatened another person 
los angeles superior court judge james albrecht ruled aug 6 
that the tapes could be released because oziel had concluded that 
the brothers were dangerous to himself and two other people to whom 
the therapist had disclosed the brothers statements 
lawyers for the brothers argued that oziels limited disclosures 
had taken care of any danger that existed and that full disclosure 
was not justified or authorized by law after a state appeals court 
let albrechts ruling stand defense lawyers appealed to the 
supreme court

was sentenced to 21 months in prison and fined 5000 friday for 
his role in funneling military procurement data to a defense 
contractor 
saunders was sentenced by us district judge albert v bryan 
jr for his role in the pentagon procurement scandal that is the 
subject of a longrunning justice department investigation dubbed 
operation ill wind 
the investigation has resulted in nearly 40 convictions of 
pentagan officials consultants and executives of defense firms as 
well as several corporations 
in an unrelated case the justice department announced friday in 
washington that a subsidiary of baltimores martin marietta corp 
martin marietta electronics and missiles group of orlando fla 
had paid an additional 256 million to settle allegations of 
overcharges for government use of the firms computers 
the company earlier paid 898000 
saunders 56 was convicted june 5 of conspiracy to defraud the 
government wire fraud and conversion of government property 
us district judge albert v bryan jr ordered that saunders 
56 be placed on two years of supervised release after completing 
the prison term 
the former navy procurement official who became a defense 
consultant was convicted of participating in a scheme to funnel 
secret pentagon bid information to another defense consultant who 
sold it to norden systems according to trial testimony 
saunders obtained the information from former navy procurement 
official george g stone who pleaded guilty to participating in 
the scheme and passed it along to defense consultant thomas e 
muldoon 
muldoon then sold the bid information about the sophisticated 
marine corps radar and communication system to norden systems one 
of several companies competing for the 100 million contract 
according to testimony 
three norden executives have already pleaded guilty to taking 
part in the operation 
muldoon who was convicted last year of unrelated defense fraud 
charges was indicted along with saunders but the charges against 
muldoon were dismissed by a judge who ruled that prosecutors may 
have indicted him as punishment for appealing the earlier ill 
wind conviction 
stone testified that he kept norden in the competition for the 
contract at the request of saunders norden dropped out of the 
competition after the ill wind investigation became public two 
years ago

a federal appeals court upheld the 
governments right to restrict payments of supplemental security 
income to aged and disabled people who have received overpayments 
from other programs 
by a 30 vote the 9th us circuit court of appeals overruled a 
decision by a san francisco federal judge who threw out the 
restrictions in nine western states the court agreed with four 
other federal appeals courts that have upheld the same rules in the 
last four years 
the ruling stems from a suit that challenged rules passed by the 
reagan administration in 1982 
under those regulations if an agency discovers it has overpaid 
someone it normally would seek to deduct the money from future 
checks under the 1982 regulation the amount of the monthly 
deduction money the recipient is not actually getting is 
counted as income in deciding whether the person is eligible for 
supplemental security income to the aged blind or disabled 
velma martin a san leandro railroad workers widow who filed 
the suit had been collecting survivors benefits from the railroad 
retirement board since 1978 and was told by the board in 1985 that 
she had been overpaid more than 8500 over four years because she 
had failed to report additional income 
under its rules the board said it was deducting ms martins 
entire check of 26814 a month for 34 months 
left with only her 386 monthly social security payment as 
income she applied for ssi benefits but was turned down because 
the deducted 26814 was counted as income putting her over the 
eligibility limit 
ms martin then sued and won a ruling by us district judge 
thelton henderson that the 1982 eligibility rules violated federal 
law 
that law defines income as payments received in the form of 
various benefits henderson said both the laws language and intent 
required actual receipt of the money and excluded money that was 
being withheld 
henderson applied his ruling to the entire circuit california 
arizona nevada oregon washington idaho montana alaska and 
hawaii plus guam and the northern marianas 
but the appeals court disagreed with his reading of the law 
under hendersons ruling ssi funds will be used to partially 
subsidize a claimants debt to an outside program said the 
appellate opinion by judge cecil poole 
he said congress would have made its intention clearer if it had 
meant to put such a serious limitation on the governments ability 
to define ssi applicants income 
poole also said ms martin and others whose overpayments came 
from the railroad retirement board could ask the board to spread 
the repayment over a longer period by reducing the monthly 
deductions 
regardless of that option the restrictions cause hardships 
said ms martins lawyer gill deford of the national senior 
citizens law center 
these are people who are receiving welfare benefits he 
said if the amount is less than theyre entitled to under 
federal law almost by definition its working a hardship

a man who sent a threatening letter to president 
bush and said he would punch his lights out if the president 
visited the northwest has been convicted on three counts and could 
face up to 15 years in prison 
defense lawyer robert leen on thursday chastized prosecutors for 
trying 43yearold eugene hains instead of ordering him to get 
mental health treatment 
leen said hains suffered posttramautic stress syndrome after 
serving in vietnam and never intended to carry out the threats he 
voiced in the letter and in a conversation with a secret service 
agent 
a federal jury convicted hains wednesday on two counts of 
threatening the president and one count of sending a threatening 
communication he faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison 
on each count although the judge was expected to be lenient 
hains was upset over bills from an anaheim calif technical 
school he briefly attended and said in a letter to bush that he 
would get a gun from mexico and kill those responsible according 
to testimony 
the letter prompted a visit from a secret service agent whom 
hains told he would punch the president if bush ever came to 
seattle or oregon 
assistant us attorney angelo calfo cited a 1981 incident in 
illinois in which hains upset over being laid off returned to his 
job site with a 12gauge shotgun and an ammunition belt slung 
around his chest he was convicted of aggravated assault in that 
episode

congress says the professor is a bit like a 
person in possession of a credit card on which the issuing bank 
somehow forgot to put a limit 
credit limits on bank cards are there to protect you from 
bankruptcy he says while you perhaps are sensible enough 
not to spend yourself into the poorhouse not everyone is 
congress he laments seems to be in that latter category it 
talks about cutting the budget deficit he says but it has already 
raised spending plans 11 percent beyond the presidents proposals 
the professor william dunkelberg is an economist but he says 
the budget deficit is almost solely a political issue everyone 
understands the need for government to live within its income but 
then politics obliterates reason he says 
history demonstrates that america needs to put a cap on federal 
spending just as certainly as those caps are needed on credit 
cards history proves it he says congress chooses to raise taxes 
instead of cutting spending 
whenever taxes are raised he continued you may be sure that 
spending also will be raised and when spending is raised just as 
certainly you can expect taxes to be raised 
but the elected official alibis government needs more money 
because of inflation not so says dunkelberg he explains 
if the tax rate is 10 percent and you earn a dollar the 
government gets 10 cents if inflation raises your salary by 10 
percent you will get 110 and the government will get 11 cents 
or 10 percent more 
however he says government spending keeps growing as a percent 
of total income and that requires higher tax rates or lots of 
new taxes thats what has been happening he says 
why should government get more of our output he asks he 
suggests everyone consider that question and make a political 
decision 
we must simply decide if we are getting our moneys worth from 
the dollars being spent by government 
if we are we shall be happy to pay if not we should cut 
spending and send those dollars back to the people who are supposed 
to be the beneficiaries of the governmental system the 
taxpayers 
dunkelberg is not just an abstract thinker he is a practical 
person who understands budgets and has to live within one as dean 
of temple universitys school of business we must cap federal 
spending he declares 
he suggests we consider proposals such as that advanced by the 
chicago association of commerce and industry which would put a 5 
percent annual cap on government spending increases and if 
inflation ate that up so be it 
it has a happy side effect of making government interested in 
keeping inflation low he observes 
if we did that he promised we would produce a balanced budget 
within a few years and then surpluses to reduce outstanding 
government debt or to provide funds for new federal tax cuts 
note he says this 5 percent cap would not deny government an 
annual increase each year it would still have about 50 billion in 
new spending to allocate as it saw fit 
all that were doing here says dunkelberg is making it 
possible to eliminate the deficit as matters stand he explains 
spending is now programmed to grow by more than revenues every 
year 
put a 5 percent cap on spending growth he argues and with 
todays tax code we would achieve in five or six years what has 
eluded us for two decades a balanced budget and after that a 
surplus

stocks have lived up to their reputation in the 
persian gulf crisis but the dollar and gold clearly have not 
youd expect stock prices to gyrate in a situation like this 
and they have 
youd likewise expect the dollar and gold to attract the smart 
money but they havent 
if this worldwide emergency has taught us anything new about the 
way the financial markets work its that some safe havens have 
lost their traditional allure 
the explanations offered sound like those used to describe the 
political plunge of the soviet union the end of the cold war has 
changed the natural order of things the market experts say that 
has reduced the urgency of the socalled flight to safety by 
investors 
in the political arena the united states has been an obvious 
beneficiary of these changes in the financial world though the 
dollar has had to make room for other superpowers principally the 
german mark 
gold too has become an alsoran moving briefly over 400 an 
ounce in the early stages of the gulf crisis then retreating 
in both cases part of the explanation is that they dont make 
world crises like they used to with the soviet union leaning 
toward the west the chances for world peace look better than the 
chances for world war no matter who americas enemy of the moment 
may be 
even outside politics recent global shocks have dissipated 
quickly the stock market crash of 1987 for instance was rapidly 
erased by a revived bull market 
persian gulf worries also shall pass traders may rush to safety 
at the first signs of trouble but exit just as swiftly on the 
expectation that even the worst problems will be temporary

when campeau corps department stores sought 
bankruptcy court sanctuary it didnt surprise wall street 
dealmakers who months ago saw the takeover business punctured by 
the failure of the companys record retailing buyout 
but campeaus latest problems seem to have driven another stake 
into the heart of the onceraging market for corporate buyouts 
bankers and investment firms have become even warier and 
its made investors more cautious said perrin long a 
securities industry analyst with lipper analytical services corp 
campeaus department store divisions federated department 
stores inc and allied stores corp filed for protection from 
their creditors under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law 
the divisions have a combined 77 billion in debt much of it 
was borrowed through highinterest junk bonds to finance the 
purchases by campeau a canadian real estate developer of allied 
in 1986 and federated in 1988 
the takeover business which boomed in the 80s on the back of 
junk bond financing had to shift quickly into low gear after 
campeau revealed its troubles last september financing for several 
deals including ramada incs restructuring and coniston partners 
acquisition of tw services inc had to be revamped because of junk 
bond market gyrations 
furthermore big banks made cautious by the campeau mess refused 
to back a planned employeemanagement buyout of united airlines 
parent ual corp 
suddenly takeover financing appeared to be drying up wall 
street reacted by throwing a tantrum the collapse of the ual deal 
helped send the dow jones industrial average plunging 190 points on 
oct 13 
by the time federated and allied headed into court last week 
as many observers had expected would happen investment bankers 
and dealmakers already were coping with a changed environment but 
experts say the campeau filing has helped to subdue the buyout 
market further 
companies still will be bought and sold but finding bond 
investors will be difficult said long 
were in a transitional period because junk bond financing 
kind of has a dirty name he said 
norman weinger and michael metz two oppenheimer amp co analysts 
agreed in a report last week that mergers and acquisitions will 
involve bigger commitments of equity by buyers 
investors simply dont want to leave themselves open to the 
kinds of losses that campeaus creditors are facing 
investment firms were listed among campeaus biggest creditors 
the firms own or hold for others billions of dollars in federated 
and allied bonds and also put up millions of their own dollars for 
shortterm bridge loans to help campeau complete the federated deal 
first boston corp campeaus lead adviser in the federated 
deal could lose as much as 293 million according to fred garcia 
a first boston spokesman 
of that amount 43 million is from junk bonds owned by first 
boston garcia said the remaining 250 million is from a bridge 
loan 
first boston already has provided for any losses by charging 
them against its 1989 earnings garcia said adding that the 
company still showed a profit for the year 
another of campeaus more than 50750 creditors is painewebber 
inc which put up a 95 million bridge loan in the federated 
buyout 
a painewebber spokesman jeffrey taufield said the companys 
losses on the loan have been offset somewhat by fees it collected 
on the federated deal like first boston painewebber has adjusted 
its 1989 earnings to reflect any losses from the unpaid loan 
publicly the companies portrayed any losses as a fact of 
investment banking life 
we remain committed to the merchant banking business 
understanding as has been demonstrated very clearly that it is 
a high risk and high reward business said garcia 
painewebber officials will continue looking at opportunities 
in companies where they believe there is longterm potential 
taufield said 
but investment bankers have been chastened somewhat by the 
campeau filing 
it would be foolish for us not to consider current market 
conditions in any transaction said an employee at one wall 
street firm were not backing away but weve got our eyes 
open 
long predicted investment firms would move to reduce their 
exposure to bridge loans which generally are refinanced with bond 
sales the firms and other creditors are lining up to see how much 
they can recover from campeau 
long speculated the firms might get 20 cents back for each 
dollar they lent 
besides their own balance sheets dealmakers are also concerned 
that campeaus troubles may revive antitakeover sentiment in 
washington 
a year ago after the record 2453 billion leveraged buyout of 
rjr nabisco inc but well before campeaus problems became public 
congressional committees held hearings on possible ways of curbing 
debtfinanced buyouts 
house judiciary committee chairman jack brooks has already 
announced that his committee will hold hearings on the campeau 
filing and and look into the consequences of leveraged buyouts 
brooks said he feared the chapter 11 filing was only the 
beginning and that we will see the takeover trophies of the 1980s 
become the bankruptcy case names of the 1990s 
another itoldyouso came from sen howard metzenbaum dohio 
whose state is home base for federated and allied 
campeau represents the merger mania of the 80s when 
companies were more interested in devouring one another than 
producing a better product metzenbaum said 
congress was out of town last week and spokesmen for the senate 
finance and house ways and means committees said there had been no 
discussion of those panels holding new hearings in the wake of the 
campeau filing 
treasury secretary nicholas brady who last year testified that 
investors could be left holding the bag if debtladen buyout 
targets ran into trouble has not commented publicly on the 
campeau filing 
brady last year did not advocate any limits on takeovers saying 
market forces should be allowed to determine the future of the 
buyout process 
congress passed some minor restrictions on the deductibility of 
interest from debtfinanced buyouts last year jim jaffe an aide 
to ways and means chairman dan rostenkowski dill said the 
committee was unable to garner enough support for more substantive 
changes because of a lack of guidance from the bush administration 
that is really what people are waiting for jaffe said 
they figure its not worth doing anything if the administration 
isnt going to ultimately sign on

as they go back to their jobs after the labor 
day weekend many government officials and wall street investment 
managers will be focused on the latest trends in the american work 
force 
a monthly report due friday on the employment situation may well 
give financial policymakers their first latesummer signal on the 
economic outlook for the rest of the year 
the data could serve as an early litmus test in the debate over 
whether a recession lies in wait 
in addition some observers think the figures may play a pivotal 
role in determining the federal reserves next move in setting its 
monetary policy 
of course veteran statisticswatchers always caution that 
numbers for any single month shouldnt be asked to carry too much 
weight 
but any weakness that shows up in the report for august would 
come on the heels of a set of decidedly downbeat readings for july 
when the unemployment rate increased to 55 percent from 52 
percent the month before 
julys employment report indicated a much weaker economy with 
heavy job losses in construction services and manufacturing 
notes the current edition of the merrill lynch market letter 
the july report showed a drop of 57000 in nonfarm payroll 
employment excluding workers employed in connection with the 
federal census merrill lynch analysts observe 
they project a further 30000 decline for august again after 
adjusting for shortterm distortions involving the census 
if there were another sizable increase in the unemployment rate 
it could represent the signal the federal reserve has been awaiting 
to relax its credit policy seeking to foster a drop in interest 
rates 
but some analysts warn against making the assumption that 
interest rates would automatically fall as evidence accumulated of 
a business slump 
one widely publicized xfactor in the equation is the august 
surge in world oil prices which has intensified fears of inflation 
in many of the industrialized countries 
in this kind of environment said paul boltz financial 
economist at t rowe price associates in baltimore easing may 
redouble the markets concerns about the feds willingness to fight 
inflation 
the pressure on oil prices eased in the past week permitting 
stock prices to rally the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
closed friday at 261436 up 8144 from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 592 to 17697 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market gained 
1388 to 38121 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was up 710 at 32339 
volume on the big board came to 12788 million shares a day 
down from 18986 million the week before 
even with cooperation from oil prices a good many observers say 
they have reservations about the interestrate outlook 
the us credit markets face stiff competition these days from 
interestbearing securities in other countries such as germany 
where rates are comparable and reported inflation is less 
there are worries too about worldwide demand for capital 
given intense needs for investment in eastern europe 
it also appears that demands to maintain a military presence 
in the middle east will absorb capital the middle east could have 
invested in foreign economies and markets said greg smith at 
prudentialbache securities 
we want to be somewhat cautious about assuming interest rates 
will come down any time soon smith concluded even if the 
economy does prove to be as weak as people expect

airline industry officials say theyre not sure 
what can be done to assure customers get faster ticket service than 
what they encountered earlier this week in a lastminute rush for 
discounted air fares 
when many travel agents around the country tried to lock in 
tickets for airline customers on wednesday their computers spit 
back this message system unavailable 
a deadline for cheap autumn fares combined with a new charge for 
higher jet fuel costs threw the nations airline reservation system 
into what agents and airlines described as an unprecedented 
gridlock 
as tens of thousands of americans jammed phone lines seeking to 
book tickets computers were so slow that getting reservation 
information often took 30 minutes or more rather than the usual few 
seconds some systems crashed and wouldbe passengers who tried 
calling airlines directly wound up on what seemed like permanent 
hold 
the systems not built to handle armageddon and wednesday was 
armageddon dexter koehl spokesman for minneapolisbased carlson 
travel network said friday people simply got shut out 
its unknown how many customers couldnt buy the discounted 
tickets but airlines said passengers had plenty of advance notice 
and shouldnt have waited until the last minute 
industry officials mostly threw up their hands and said there 
was little that could be done to avoid such days in the future 
they said increasing the capacity of airline reservation systems 
has never been discussed because the computers never faced such 
large demand 
but some agents said two prior extensions by airlines of the 
midnight deadline wednesday may have encouraged travelers to take a 
chance and hope for another extension before making plans that 
also may have added to the burden 
the double whammy was a deadline for special fares described 
as among the best deals in recent years with prices discounted 40 
percent or more and a 53 percent fuel surcharge on all tickets 
travel agents worked well into the night to meet demand and 
airlines including northwest airlines american airlines and trans 
world airlines extended the deadline 
we ended up hand writing a lot of tickets said a west coast 
travel agent who asked not to be named im sure we missed a lot 
of calls where we could help people 
usair spokeswoman susan young said the airline received about 
330000 telephone calls on wednesday about 100000 more than 
normal it refused to extend the deadline 
we gave people plenty of time and plenty of notice young 
said there was adequate time people who did hang on the line 
were able to make reservations 
americans sabre airline reservations network with 125000 
terminals handled 100 million entries requesting information on 
wednesday about 25 percent more than the previous singleday 
record 
the airline added a midnight to 6 am shift of agents after 
realizing that thousands of callers probably werent getting 
through and it honored the cheap rates until that time 
i dont know what else we could have done in this case 
american spokesman tim smith said the fares were there for 
almost three weeks we always urge people to plan ahead 
northwest spokesman doug miller said the airline extended the 
cheap fares for 24 hours because people who under normal 
circumstances would have had plenty of time to make the booking 
werent able to 
our computer reservation system was overloaded we were 
experiencing delays in getting bookings accomplished he said 
the fares were good enough to fight for despite busy signals and 
onhold elevator music a midweek roundtrip flight between new york 
and charlotte nc was 158 under the special fare compared to 
251 now a new york to los angeles ticket was 318 until 
wednesday now 449 
carlson travel network which has 1300 offices nationwide said 
its air sales in the first three days of the week as the deadline 
bulge grew were 39 million compared with 30 million for the 
previous seven days 
at one carlson agency in midtown manhattan the manager stayed 
until 330 am thursday processing tickets the company is busy 
calculating its overtime costs for the week 
its like when you flip on every switch in the house 
susannah knight owner of knight travel in charlotte said of the 
overload they more or less blew a fuse

the aaa predicted a 2 percent decrease in labor day travel but 
it said higher gasoline is not to blame 
we think it has more to do with just the general doldrums of 
the economy aaa spokesman geoff sundstrom said historically 
people tend to curtail their travel if theyre concerned about 
their economic livelihood high prices by themselves dont seem to 
cut into travel that much 
motorists interviewed around the nation agreed they are pretty 
much hooked on fuel so theyre using it even if they dont like 
the price 
it ought to be back where it was before they started all this 
foolishness said jacob rogers 84 of belgrade maine as he 
filled his station wagon at north augusta texaco on friday 
i think its terrible but what are you going to do asked 
lewis ashley of raleigh nc gasoline is a necessity people are 
going to drive even if hits 2 a gallon they dont have much of a 
choice 
ashley said he had started riding city buses more in the last 
month because of the increased gasoline prices 
driving 303 miles from st louis to chicago would take 1980 
worth of gas at current prices and an average 20 miles per gallon 
compared with 1642 on july 4 or 1609 last labor day 
cars with better gas mileage would cost less but gas guzzlers 
would cost more 
if people realize that on a relatively short trip that were 
not really talking big bucks it shouldnt stop them from going 
said bern rotman spokesman for the new york state department of 
economic development his department estimated a labor day round 
trip of 600 miles will cost just 532 more than it did last year 
people have planned their labor day trip and theyre taking 
it said frank eastvedt spokesman for the automobile club of 
southern california 
the club has noticed changes in the types of vacations people 
are taking 
were doing more short trips than longer ones he said 
theyre taking maybe trips just within the state rather than 
going further 
a survey in alabama found motorists are avoiding the 
fullservice lanes and pumping their own gas often they switch to 
cheaper grades

hundreds of union workers at chrysler corp have 
accepted buyouts designed to reduce the no 3 automakers need for 
layoffs 
the workers punched out for the last time friday chrysler 
spokesman lee sechler estimated about 600 people had signed up for 
the buyout program 
its a positive alternative to layoffs he said 
the reduction in the companys work force comes as chrysler 
negotiates a new national labor contract with the united auto 
workers union and as the financially struggling company seeks ways 
to cut costs 
meantime negotiators for the uaw and general motors corp 
continued meetings friday in subcommittees that focus on particular 
contract issues such as wages benefits and job security 
last tuesday the union picked gm as its bargaining target 
intending to reach an agreement that it can then bring to the other 
two automakers contracts covering more than 450000 active workers 
for gm chrysler and ford motor co expire sept 14 
gm and uaw officials said they planned to meet during the labor 
day weekend negotiations began in midjuly 
sechler said it wont be known until late next week or perhaps 
later how much money the automaker is spending on the buyout he 
declined to provide details of the plan which is contained in a 
1988 national uawchrysler contract 
the payout formula is based primarily on an eligible workers 
seniority with chrysler there are about 60000 uawcovered 
employees at chrysler but company and union officials said they 
didnt know precisely how many of them would be eligible for the 
program 
the plans is not open to workers in some chrysler factories 
such as its jeep assembly plant in toledo and some job 
classifications within plants such as skilled trades 
chrysler is involved in a costcutting program launched last 
october to slice 15 billion from its 26 billion annual budget by 
the end of this year 
the automakers secondquarter earnings were down 472 percent 
and chrysler has acknowledged that the company will post a 
significant loss during the third quarter mainly because of 
production interruptions at its profitable minivan plants 
production at the minivan factories in st louis and windsor 
ontario was stopped for about four weeks to retool for 1991 models 
since reaching its 1988 contract with the uaw chrysler has shut 
down two assembly plants in kenosha wis and detroit resulting 
in more than 7000 layoffs chrysler plans to close its st louis 
car plant nov 9 
meantime an unidentified uaw official was harshly critical of 
chrysler in a story in friday editions of the detroit news for 
reinstating merit pay for executives while pleading poverty to 
hourly workers 
sechler said an inhouse magazine distributed to employees in 
april noted that the meritpay program had been reinstated after 
being suspended last october when the costcutting program began
