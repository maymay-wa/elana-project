drake memorial hospital has paid 23 million 
to settle all lawsuits filed by families of 26 patients that former 
nurses aide donald harvey confessed to killing lawyers announced 
friday 
lawyers for the hospital and the families will ask county common 
pleas judge william morrissey to dismiss the lawsuits said james 
burke a lawyer asked by hamilton county commissioners to help 
negotiate the settlement 
the lawsuits were filed after harvey pleaded guilty beginning 
in august 1987 to 37 murders in ohio and kentucky the victims 
also included patients at marymount hospital in london ky where 
harvey worked in 1970 and 1971 
harvey who said he killed his victims by poisoning them or 
suffocating them with plastic bags is serving three consecutive 
life sentences in an ohio prison 
the hospital did not admit any wrongdoing in the deaths lawyers 
said drake officials reached the settlement to avert a trial 
the plaintiffs continue to believe in their position and the 
defendants continue to deny that they are legally responsible for 
harveys actions lawyers for both sides said in a joint 
statement 
at the time of the murders to which harvey confessed drake 
hospital was owned by hamilton county the hospital sold its assets 
to the university of cincinnati in july 1989 and is now known as 
drake center inc 
the settlement does not affect drake center burke said 
a lawyer for the families of eight of harveys victims paul 
martins said of the settlement i think its fair in weighing 
everything it certainly doesnt compensate for all of the loss 
the reason to settle is from a practical standpoint not putting 
these poor people through a trial 
martins said the families also obtained an agreement through 
which they could collect damages of as much as 11 million from 
harvey should he ever earn money from movies or books about the 
murders

the brother of carol stuart said his parents are 
still devastated over her death but their faith in people has been 
restored by the donations that continue to arrive for a foundation 
established in her name 
but in the nearly two months since 37yearold carl dimaiti and 
his parents learned that charles stuart probably plotted his wifes 
death and told some family members before committing suicide they 
have yet to receive an apology from the stuarts 
nothing theres been nothing said dimaiti in the first 
formal interview he has given since charles stuart apparently 
jumped off bostons tobin bridge to his death jan 4 
dimaiti spoke friday the day after the fbi began a preliminary 
inquiry into the boston police department investigation surrounding 
the slaying of carol stuart the investigation focuses on 
allegations that police intimidated and coerced several people into 
implicating william bennett in the oct 23 crime 
the suffolk county grand jury met friday for the fourth time 
since charles stuarts death reportedly appearing before the panel 
were three of stuarts siblings neysa porter shelley yandoli and 
michael stuart 
carl dimaiti a former high school teacher who now runs the 
family pizza dough business said the family still is angry about 
the slaying of his sister and the stuart familys silence 
but dimaiti said the family has found new hope in the carol 
dimaiti stuart foundation formed last month the foundation was 
established to award scholarships to residents of the mission hill 
neighborhood where charles stuart had told police that a black 
gunman shot him and critically wounded his pregnant wife 
carol stuart died shortly after the shooting and the couples 
son delivered by caesarean section died 17 days later 
contributions totaling 253000 have poured in from around the 
country the latest a check for 512240 from new england baptist 
hospital many letters are addressed simply to dimaiti family 
medford mass dimaiti said and many are from people who also 
experienced the loss of a loved one he said 
they said the pain will ease dimaiti said they say its 
something you never get over but it does get better 
dimaiti described his mother as still devastated by the death of 
her daughter but said the letters and contributions from as far 
away as california and overseas have helped restore her faith in 
people 
giusto 64 and evelyn dimaiti 58 have declined to speak 
publicly about the case except for a speech the elder dimaiti made 
during a press conference last month announcing that the foundation 
would be set up 
representatives of a public relations company hired by the 
families monitored fridays interview and tried to prevent dimaiti 
from answering questions other than general comments about the 
foundation 
dimaiti declined to comment on the fbis inquiry into the manner 
in which boston police handled the case

a county sheriff who shocked state 
officials when he seized a national guard armory to house prisoners 
from his overcrowded jail has won the right to keep them there for 
at least two more weeks 
the decision came at a hearing friday that followed a weeklong 
standoff between the state and the sheriff who argued that he had 
a choice between seizing the armory or turning prisoners out on the 
streets 
i just felt i couldnt take it any more and it was important 
to take a strong step hampden county sheriff michael ashe said 
after fridays hearing 
ashe agreed to allow the national guard to keep operating from 
the building superior court judge george keady set a march 12 
court date for both sides to report back with a permanent solution 
if they dont keady will hold a hearing on ashes earlier request 
for a preliminary injunction to stay at the armory 
i think what we wanted to do is keep it on the front burner 
but turn down the heat said lawrence fletcherhill assistant 
attorney general 
were putting the issue of the sheriffs actions to the side 
its more important that we find a solution he said 
the sheriff shocked state officials feb 16 when he moved on 
the armory informing national guardsmen he was seizing the 
building under a 17th century statute ordering him to keep the 
peace 
state officials at first reacted angrily secretary of public 
safety charles v barry who has jurisdiction over armories in the 
state issued a statement saying he would pursue criminal trespass 
charges against ashe 
the state had argued that ashe is a county official and does not 
have the right to take state property 
after ashe won a temporary restraining order allowing him to 
stay at the armory along with widespread support from residents 
local officials and even prisoners the focus turned to trying to 
work out a compromise location for the prisoners 
officials would not specify what locations they are considering 
for overflow prisoners a new jail to replace the countys 
102yearold jail is scheduled to be built in nearby ludlow but 
completion is at least two years away 
nineteen inmates are currently housed in the armory in a large 
room with a concrete floor and a volleyball net stretched between 
two walls previously it was used for drill exercises by the 
national guard 
inmates have said the armory is an improvement over the hampden 
county jail which was built to hold 279 inmates and is under a 
federal court order to hold no more than 500 inmates 
ashe said hes pleased at his initial success in finding at 
least a temporary solution to his problem 
i really feel good that were able to keep on fighting he 
said

eric ramirez knows hes bound to lose 
in sundays presidential elections but the social christian party 
candidate hopes to become an important factor in political 
developments following the election 
ramirez the candidate of the social christian party believes 
president daniel ortega of the governing leftist sandinistas will 
win with about 50 percent of the vote 
he thinks violeta barrios de chamorros united national 
opposition a broad coalition known as uno will come in second 
with about 35 percent 
there are seven other candidates in the election ramirez is the 
only one expected to draw a significant percentage of the vote 
ramirez 43 sees the election as a landmark in the history of 
nicaragua with changes coming no matter who wins 
the opposition made a serious mistake when it didnt run six 
years ago we could have exercised a lot of pressure through the 
assembly all these years he said in an interview 
many opposition parties including the social christians and an 
earlier broad coalition like uno refused to take part in a vote 
overwhelmingly won by the sandinistas 
this time around the uno coalition wanted ramirez to join but 
he refused to go along 
he said the 14party coalition an odd mixture ranging from the 
communist party to conservative elements of the private business 
council will fall apart under the pressure of specific political 
decisions 
some of those people especially the communists and the 
socialists if they get someone elected to the assembly will vote 
with the fsln sandinistas not with the private business people 
losing presidential candidates who get a certain number of votes 
the number is set by a complicated formula but will probably be 
about 15000 get a seat in the national assembly 
ramirez hopes to lead six or seven other social christians in 
what would be a 99member assembly if all presidential losers gain 
seats 
that could make the social christians an important party 
because ramirez and some others see uno splitting into its many 
political components to seek temporary alliances 
you have the united states providing money to the uno that 
will probably elect two members of the communist party who already 
are talking to the fsln ramirez said using initials of the 
sandinista national liberation front he was referring to us 
economic aid to the uno 
we can become the second largest single political party in the 
assembly after the sandinistas he said 
bayardo arce ortegas campaign manager said he agreed with 
ramirez on both points the social christians will win six to seven 
seats and end up as the second largest party 
ramirez calls himself a centrist who believes the united states 
should stop sponsoring contra guerrillas who have fought a war to 
topple the government 
reality will force both the united states and the sandinistas 
to become pragmatic and seek an accommodation ramirez said

key international observers say they 
expect sundays national elections to be free and fair despite 
problems during the often bitter campaign 
ive given a lot of thought to how the system could be beat 
said former us attorney general elliott richardson who heads a 
un observer mission i havent yet been able to come up with a 
good scheme 
a un report he released friday concludes that nicaraguas 175 
million registered voters are in a position to decide between 
alternatives which have been given a reasonable chance to be 
aired 
the campaign was not without problems it said but it has 
changed the way elections are perceived by redefining and 
considerably broadening the limits of political action in 
nicaragua 
the organization of american states reached similar conclusions 
about the possibility of a fair election on sunday as did former 
president jimmy carter 
carter is heading up a group of international observers that 
includes five us senators and seven house members three former 
state governors a prime minister and five former presidents 
carter who cried foul in the panamanian election last year 
while the votes were still being counted is regarded as one of the 
most influential observers 
his delegation is working closely with both the organization of 
american states and the united nations which among them are 
fielding more than 700 observers 
we will monitor every step of the process and do parallel 
tabulations of the vote to guarantee that the final results reflect 
the will of the people carter said after arriving in nicaragua 
on friday 
the governing leftist sandinistas expect to win the election 
and they hope an internationally recognized victory will lead to an 
end to the us economic embargo and us support for the contra 
rebels 
the verdict of the observers from carters atlantabased council 
of freely elected heads of government is considered crucial to a 
change in attitude by the bush administration 
rep jim slattery a kansas democrat said an honest election 
could pave the way to a new us policy on nicaragua 
if the election is free and fair and if the nicaraguan 
government ceases any further attempt to export revolution and stir 
up trouble in el salvador then i think the american government 
should honor the will of the nicaraguan people and move toward 
improving economic relations and diplomatic relations said 
slattery one of the observers 
the nicaraguan government has previously said it is not 
supplying weapons to the salvadoran guerrillas president daniel 
ortega has signed a regional accord pledging not to provide such 
aid 
in todays editions of the new york times he was quoted as 
saying he would not provide arms to them after the elections if he 
is reelected and he called el salvadors rightist government 
legitimate 
ortegas main challenger is publisher violeta barrios de 
chamorro of the united national opposition or uno a coalition of 
14 parties and one native indian group 
despite their generally optimistic conclusions the key 
observers all concede there have been problems including violence 
in the early days of the campaign intimidation limited opposition 
access to the statecontrolled media and the control of other 
resources by the sandinistas 
the un report says the problems have diminished in the final 
days of the campaign even though the question of free electoral 
competition will no doubt be the subject of controversy 
virgilio godoy unos vice presidential candidate said friday 
the coalition would recognize a sandinista victory if it is honest

economist in the nixon administration said friday the countrys 
500000 lawyers are dampening the gross national product by 500

congress may be headed toward a legislative or 
legal confrontation with the bush administration over 125 billion 
in pentagon projects the administration wants to put on hold 
armed with a new general accounting office opinion several 
members of congress urged the bush administration friday to 
reconsider its postponement of the 15 projects which had been 
previously approved for 1990 funding 
the administrations reasoning in announcing the delays earlier 
this month was too vague to meet legal requirements milton j 
soccolar the special assistant to the head of the gao said in an 
opinion 
the administrations entire explanation of the deferrals is 
that they are necessary because of changes in requirements in view 
of the promising developments in the soviet union and eastern 
europe soccolar wrote wednesday to sen robert byrd dwva 
chairman of the senate appropriations committee the gao is an 
investigative arm of congress 
this is not the detailed reasoned explanation for the 
deferrals which section 1013 of the relevant law requires it is 
no more than a generalized assertion he wrote 
the postponed projects include aircraft modifications navy ship 
conversions expected to be a boon to many coastal states defense 
software research and army army reserve and air national guard 
construction projects 
the appropriations panel released a letter friday in which byrd 
and the panels ranking republican sen mark hatfield of oregon 
asked budget director richard darman to reconsider the 
postponements 
in light of these findings by the gao we urge the 
administration to withdraw immediately any and all deferrals other 
than those that involve the routine withholding of funds in 
connection with the normal and orderly operation of the 
government byrd and hatfield said 
among the postponed projects was a 32 million access road for 
the tobyhanna army depot in northeastern pennsylvania 
reps paul kanjorski dpa and joseph mcdade rpa wrote 
bush on friday saying such projects should not be written off in 
the drive for budget savings as a result of emerging democracy in 
eastern europe 
we fail to see the relationship and linkage between recent 
international events and a pressing public works project that has 
been planned for several years they said 
the office of management and budget said friday it would have no 
immediate comment on the issue 
presidents routinely ask congress to delay billions of dollars 
of planned spending each year by law those requests called 
deferrals are permissible because of unexpected contingencies or 
a chance to save money through better management 
but delays are not allowable for policy reasons they can be 
blocked by a majority vote of either chamber or by a civil suit 
filed by the head of the gao senate appropriations officials said 
they hoped the issue could be resolved without court action 
the gao said its study showed 125 billion was being improperly 
deferred by the administration

jesse jackson facing signs city voters are 
wary that he will run for mayor in the wake of mayor marion barrys 
drug arrest has told supporters he wont seek barrys job 
associates say 
hes not going to run for mayor of washington we talked about 
it yesterday joel ferguson who managed jacksons 1988 
presidential campaign in michigan told a lansing mich 
television station friday 
jackson a twotime democratic presidential contender was en 
route to chicago on friday evening there was no answer at his 
chicago home 
jacksons political plans have been the subject of speculation 
since he moved to the nations capital in april that speculation 
intensified with barrys arrest last month on a cocaine possession 
charge 
jackson has said his recent campaign to gain statehood for the 
district of columbia will remain his priority he has said he will 
formally announce next week he will not run for mayor associates 
said 
a top jackson aide frank watkins refused friday to discuss 
jacksons decision on the mayoral race 
one of the reasons jesse would run for anything like mayor of 
a major city is to come in as a healer ferguson told station 
wkar in a way his candidacy would be viewed as divisive 
ferguson estimated the chance that jackson would run at only 10 
percent but another supporter said jackson told him flatly that he 
would not run 
jesse is out said the supporter who spoke on condition of 
anonymity he has decided that it would be wrong for him to get 
into the race at this time or at all 
barry is at a south carolina hospital for treatment for what 
aides as called an alcohol problem city administrator carol 
thompson is running the city in barrys absence 
jacksons apparent decision comes amid growing signs that voters 
and politicians are wary of a jackson mayoral bid 
a washington post poll released thursday reported jackson would 
trail barry if both were candidates in the september democratic 
primary 
jackson has repeatedly refused to rule out a run for barrys 
job saying he would only seek the office if barry a colleague in 
the civil rights battle did not run for a fourth term 
jeffrey n gildenhorn a barry fundraiser said jackson 
associates told him that a mayoral candidacy was extremely unlikely 
there were strong indications from his people that jacksons 
decision not to run was just a formality that needed to be 
announced gildenhorn said i started hearing that last week 
barry has been silent since his arrest on his plans for 
reelection aides close to the mayor have said barry acknowledged 
privately the weekend after his arrest that he would not run again 
the washington post poll of 800 district residents found that 
barry was preferred by 25 percent of those surveyed while 19 
percent said they would vote for jackson if barry werent in the 
race jackson would receive support from 26 percent of those 
questioned compared with 19 percent for city councilman john ray 
the poll had a margin of error of 4 percentage points

the remaining federal indictments against three men 
who were already cleared of charges that they illegally armed and 
trained the contras have been dismissed a defense attorney said 
charges involving weapons or passport violations were dropped 
against former mercenery jack terrell former civilian materiel 
assistance activist jose coutin and rene corvo an opponent of 
cubas fidel castro 
its the first clear victory for the whistleblowers in this 
whole affair said terrells attorney john mattes describing 
the decision to drop the charges 
the three and 10 other people were indicted by a federal grand 
jury in 1988 on charges of violating the us neutrality act for 
allegedly assisting the nicaraguan contras in 1984 and 1985 
two fort lauderdale federal judges dismissed those charges 
agreeing with defense attorneys that the us government waged war 
against nicaragua despite congressional votes to cut off funds to 
the usbacked contra rebels 
the neutrality act allows prosecution of anyone making war from 
us soil against a nation with which the united states is at peace 
the us attorneys office said friday the lesser charges had 
been dropped against terrell coutin and corvo said mattes the 
rest of the defendants already had been cleared completely 
obviously the government felt the charges of harassment and 
selective prosecution were too sensitive mattes said and i 
think they were fearful of disclosing illegal wiretaps in this 
case 
the us attorneys office did not return telephone calls friday 
from the associated press 
terrell had become disenchanted with the contras in 1986 and 
his information helped lead to the two indictments terrells 
revelations to the fbi angered thennational security agency aide 
oliver north and north ordered the former mercenary investigated 
according to later congressional investigations into the 
irancontra scandal 
mattes said it was ironic that terrell faced the strongest 
charges a possible 40year prison sentence in a case which he 
had helped bring about 
the last of the charges dropped against terrell were two counts 
of illegally transporting weapons a charge of allowing someone 
else to use his passport was dropped against coutin the dismissed 
charges against corvo accused him of shipping a 20mm cannon a 
mortar and other weapons from fort lauderdale to contra bases in 
costa rica under the guise of humanitarian aid

senate majority leader george mitchell says 
democrats are impatient with the slow progress of a bipartisan 
house task force on campaign finance reform and will push a vote in 
the senate next month on their own legislation 
mitchell dmaine said the senate rules committee will approve 
a bill in early march and the full senate will take it up later in 
the month 
mitchell joined at a news conference by house speaker thomas s 
foley dwash cast doubt on prospects for a bipartisan bill that 
includes spending ceilings 
as public demand for reform rises we ought to be able to come 
together and bridge our differences mitchell said if we 
cannot do so then we will proceed to attempt to enact a bill in 
any event over whatever opposition exists 
foley said the 21member house task force of members from both 
parties that was created last year will continue its work but he 
acknowledged the task force is not going to find a package 
agreeable to both parties 
we hope there will be some of the bill at least that could be 
bipartisan he said we will clearly have differences 
democrats had hoped to see what the task force produced before 
tackling the campaign finance issue again in the senate where the 
last effort to toughen the law died in 1988 under a gop filibuster 
senate republican leader bob dole has remained noncommittal on 
the issue and sen ted stevens of alaska the senior republican on 
the senate rules committee said at a hearing thursday i dont 
think our side of the aisle is going to change 
mitchell acknowledged allegations against six senators accused 
of intervening with federal thrift regulators or housing officials 
on behalf of campaign contributors is the driving force behind the 
legislation 
many americans believe that their elected representatives are 
more responsive to campaign contributors than to constituents he 
said the perception is that fundraising has overtaken the 
election process and it is demeaning this institution 
mitchell and democratic sens robert c byrd of west virginia 
and david boren of oklahoma are cosponsoring a bill limiting 
contributions by political action committees or pacs and 
individuals to national and state party organizations 
as an incentive to comply with voluntary spending ceilings one 
draft provides that candidates who remain under the limit would be 
entitled to discount mail and tv advertising rates 
the democratic bill also would require more disclosure of 
socalled soft money contributions from labor unions trade 
associations and individuals to party organizations and for other 
campaign causes 
mitchell said he still favors public financing of political 
campaigns but conceded there is not enough support to get it 
enacted

president bush wants arthur a fletcher to 
restore the civil rights commission as an effective institution 
after years in which civil rights groups said the commission wasnt 
doing its job 
we think they can do a better job white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said friday in announcing fletchers 
selection 
fletcher 65 is a moderate black republican who has served in 
three previous gop administrations 
bush sought to give him the post nearly a year ago but the 
chairman of the commission william b allen wouldnt resign at 
the time 
civil rights groups and members of congress have criticized the 
commission for its positions during the reagan administration 
including opposition to affirmative action programs 
fletcher was assistant secretary of labor under president nixon 
deputy assistant for urban affairs under president ford and an 
adviser to president reagan he also served with bush at the united 
nations in 1971 
in announcing fletchers nomination on friday fitzwater said 
we wanted to name a new chairman and reinvigorate the commission 
but we had to have a vacancy to do it 
allen the former chairman indicated that he would not 
voluntarily step aside when reports first surfaced that bush wanted 
to select fletcher as the commission chairman but he did resign 
late last year with a blast at bush calling his administration 
too reticent to contribute to the debate on civil rights 
fitzwater said bush wants to see the commission restored as an 
effective institution 
we have felt that it could be stronger and more forceful in 
representing the concerns of minorities and others we expect it to 
operate in that fashion the spokesman said 
fitzwater said another vacancy on the eightmember commission 
will be filled soon the president and congress each appoint four 
members 
the commission was established in 1957 it evaluates federal 
laws and the effectiveness of the governments equalopportunity 
programs and serves as a clearinghouse for civil rights information 
allens tenure at the agency was marked by controversy and 
confrontation with other commissioners a speech he delivered last 
year titled blacks animals homosexuals what is a minority 
was formally condemned as thoughtless disgusting and 
unnecessarily inflammatory on a 61 vote of the commission 
an arizona native fletcher was executive director of the united 
negro college fund in 197273 in 1971 he was alternate delegate 
to the general assembly of the united nations

the european economic community is considering 
granting the emerging democracies of eastern europe associate 
membership to encourage their economic reforms 
frans andriessen vice president for external affairs and trade 
policy of the european community said the western democracies 
needed to do everything possible to encourage the dramatic pace of 
reforms under way in the former communist bloc 
if in the west we persevere in our efforts to assist them 
then an economic revolution will succeed the political ones 
andriessen said friday 
the 12nation community has already expanded its economic help 
beyond the original targets of poland and hungary to include east 
germany czechoslovakia bulgaria romania and yugoslavia 
but andriessen said the community is also studying going beyond 
grants to anchor these new eastern democracies to the free world 
through a form of association with the european community if they 
want to 
andriessens comments came in a speech to a business conference 
afterwards he told reporters that the proposal would be reviewed 
further before being taken up by the communitys policymaking body 
in late june or july 
in a fact sheet the community said associate membership could 
be granted to countries to recognize their geographic proximity 
shared political economic and cultural values and increased 
interdependence 
it suggested that one model for such association would be the 
existing european free trade association austria finland 
iceland norway sweden and switzerland who are not members of 
the european economic community but who enjoy certain economic ties 
with the eec 
us trade representative carla hills who also addressed the 
conference said that though the united states is negotiating trade 
agreements with the soviet union and eastern europe completely 
normal trade relations would not occur until those countries became 
full members in the general agreement on tariffs and trade the 
96country organization that regulates world trade 
to join gatt she said these countries will have to clear the 
major hurdle of making their currencies convertible into other 
currencies and base their economies on market pricing rather than 
pricing by government decree

supporters of legal abortions say the defeat 
of antiabortion bills in indiana and a veto of one in michigan 
show lawmakers are proving reluctant to impose new restrictions 
prochoice leaders also hailed the defeat of bills this week in 
the virginia and kansas legislatures and the adjournment of utahs 
legislature without passing any antiabortion bill 
this weeks events are irrefutable proof that the prochoice 
majority will mount significant opposition to the serious threat to 
choice that still exists in americas statehouses kate 
michelman executive director of the national abortion rights 
action league said friday 
nancy myers spokeswoman for the antiabortion national right to 
life committee acknowledged her group had suffered setbacks in 
several states this week but she said it succeeded in winning 
passage in south carolina of a bill requiring a parents permission 
for a minor woman to receive an abortion 
its tremendously exciting myers said things are 
happening everywhere its only february state legislatures are 
still in session weve got a long time before we see how the chips 
are going to fall 
much of the political fight over abortion is being waged in the 
statehouses this winter as antiabortion forces try to take 
advantage of an opening given them by the supreme courts webster 
decision last year it gave states new authority to impose limits 
on a womans right to an abortion by upholding a missouri law 
michelman plans to travel to minnesota next week where her side 
expects a legislative showdown over a bill that would prohibit 
abortions as a means of birth control a provision that would 
prevent most abortions 
both sides say alabamas legislature may be a key battleground 
next week with floor action possible on similar antiabortion 
legislation 
in indianapolis the state senate defeated legislation thursday 
to ban abortions in public hospitals 
were not going to be debating this issue again in the indiana 
senate during this session said dinah farrington a lobbyist for 
planned parenthood inc which supports legal abortions 
in michigan democratic gov jim blanchard on friday vetoed a 
bill that would have required minors to get permission either from 
their parents or a court before having an abortion his veto had 
been expected 
blanchard said he supported parental involvement in such 
decisions but that the bill takes a womans right to help herself 
away from her 
myers spokeswoman for the national antiabortion group said it 
had assurances that south carolinas republican gov carroll 
campbell would sign a similar bill passed in his state 
officials at naral the national abortionrights lobbying group 
in washington also cited the defeat in virginias state senate of 
a similar parentalconsent bill and the kansas legislatures defeat 
of abortion restrictions 
they pointed to the adjournment of the legislature in utah 
saying it represented a victory for them in a state where only two 
months ago odds had looked good for the imposition of abortion 
restrictions 
we have not won the war by any stretch michelman said we 
have a long way to go but we are making gains and politicians 
are feeling our strength

as an 8monthold boy cuts his teeth and 
makes new gurgling sounds a judge is deciding who the baby will 
call mommy and daddy in place of parents who died on an 
earthquakesmashed freeway 
the babys parents dropped jimmy brown off at his 
greatgrandmothers home on oct 17 as they headed to a berkeley 
pier to go fishing with friends they never saw the baby again 
michelle richard 18 and 21yearold james brown iii a high 
school student and her unemployed lover died when the 
71magnitude quake twisted an elevated portion of freeway on which 
they traveled into a mangled mess of collapsed concrete and steel 
a total of 67 people lost their lives in the temblor most of them 
on the freeway 
the quake left their baby at the center of an intense emotional 
and legal tugofwar several bereaved relatives stepped forward 
seeking custody of jimmy who stands to collect at least 100000 
from a statecontrolled account compensating relatives of the 
freeway victims 
the state board of control has delayed awarding the claim until 
alameda county superior judge roderic duncan decides which 
relative set of relatives or outsiders will care for jimmy 
hearings are set for april 13 and 22 
walnut creek attorney peter hinton one of two lawyers 
representing maternal grandmother anita williams complained that 
bigoted media coverage of the family squabbles has been 
almost like a rape case theyre being subjected to a public 
scrutiny in a very unfair way 
the tragedy is being overlooked he said 
in making his decision duncan will have to sift through 
allegations of drug and alcohol abuse fingerpointing about 
criminal records teenage sex and cycles of poverty 
the parties seeking custody are 
maternal grandmother williams 35 who has three other 
children a threebedroom townhouse and income derived solely from 
welfare jimmys been staying primarily with her since the 
earthquake 
shes being portrayed as welfare trash said hinton who 
added that the only time williams accepted welfare is when she was 
unable to collect support money from her childrens father 
jimmys paternal grandfather and his wife who have a hauling 
and landscape business in oakland james brown ii served a recent 
prison term for theft his son also did time in jail for possession 
last april of crack cocaine for sale 
greatgrandmother louise brown a 65yearold family matriarch 
who said she raised jimmys father almost like one of her own sons 
and probably spent more time looking after the baby than did either 
one of his parents 
i thought that eventually they would get hurt or something bad 
would happen to them mrs brown said of jimmys parents who she 
said had hung around with nothing but bad actors 
although critical of michelles family for what she called lack 
of discipline and other problems mrs brown said she favors anita 
williams adopting jimmy if she takes good care of him and allows 
other relatives to visit 
the court also could place jimmy with a foster family or 
unrelated adoptive parents two county family service counselors 
are investigating the situation 
s simone campbell a stateappointed attorney representing 
jimmy said were hoping that another family member surfaces 
everythings wide open at this point said campbell a 
catholic nun every one of the parties have their strengths and 
weaknesses but enough weaknesses that i have some concerns 
campbell said applications for the state compensation apparently 
led the family reluctantly into court unable any more to pass 
jimmy around between homes of various relatives without serious 
disputes 
she said jimmy showed no apparent dramatic problems and 
described him as laughing and giggly and doing things that 
8monthold kids seem to do 
this much pain hopefully will give rise to something good 
eventually campbell said

the leader of nicaraguas rebel military forces 
predicts the nations sandinista government will remain in control 
no matter what the outcome of sundays elections 
the united national opposition coalition is given little hope of 
ousting the 11yearold sandinista government but even an upset 
victory would face difficulty overcoming an armed party as 
israel galeano called the sandinistas 
it is one thing for uno to win its another for them to 
succeed in their objectives said the commander who has led the 
rebel movement since the old civilian directorate was abolished and 
rival enrique bermudez was pushed aside 
galeano who used the name commander franklin noted that the 
sandinistas have refused to give absentee votes to an estimated 
700000 exiled nicaraguans more than 20 percent of the central 
american nations population or the 7000 contra troops he said 
are still camped inside nicaragua 
the contras skepticism toward the elections is mirrored by many 
exiles in miami where few of the 50000 exiles are making plans to 
return home 
the goal of these people is to get their family out said 
volunteer donald baldizol at the nicaraguan assistance center on 
friday they are poor people and they dont see any future 
there 
prominent nicaraguan exiles agree that even in the best of 
cases there will be no mass reintegration of the exiles into 
nicaraguan life 
roberto arguello president of the nicaraguan american bankers 
association and a member of the us senate task force on hispanic 
affairs said he expects 100000 more nicaraguans to stream into 
the united states 
when they see they have daniel ortega for another five years 
they will leave said arguello 
he said that in 10 years of sandinista rule the average income 
has slipped to 1950 levels 
in another 10 years it will be down to the 1920s the banker 
said 
a few nicaraguans here say although skepticism is merited there 
is at least a little hope that uno candidate violeta chamorro can 
win and exiles can return home 
you cannot get mangoes from apple trees and the sandinista 
record certainly does not lend itself to having a credibile 
election said adolfo calero former contra leader who now works 
for the nicaraguan american foundation but it would be a great 
advancement if she won and she could eventually achieve real 
power with the support of the people 
calero said he had wanted to return to nicaragua to participate 
in the elections but was denied a passport by the sandinistas 
if violeta wins i will seriously consider going back he 
said and even if the sandinistas win there is chance that 
pragmatically they will have to move closer to the united states 
win or lose the sandinistas are bound to lose calero said 
the only unknown factor is time they cannot run against the 
world current and remain untouched

shortly after the exxon valdez ran 
aground joseph hazelwood insisted to investigators that he drank 
nothing stronger than a beer during a day ashore preceding the 
accident 
jurors heard a tape friday of hazelwoods account told to a 
coast guard investigator he gave a scenario of his shore visit 
which was nearly identical to that depicted by witnesses at his 
criminal trial except for one crucial detail the drinking 
witnesses have said that hazelwood spent at least part of the 
afternoon of march 23 at the pipeline club in valdez drinking 
vodka hazelwood said it wasnt so 
the muffled tape played for the jury showed that the skipper was 
being questioned about alcohol use 13 hours after the 987foot 
tanker ran aground on bligh reef unleashing the nations worst oil 
spill 
there have been some suggestions and statements concerning the 
fact that ah that you had some alcohol or an odor of alcohol on 
you do you asked coast guard investigator mark delozier 
delozier has testified he smelled alcohol on hazelwoods breath 
well i had one of those phony beers moussy and id been 
ashore hazelwood responded i had lunch drank iced tea 
he said he finished lunch with some fellow officers in valdez at 
about 2 pm i did a little shopping got some post cards and 
sent some flowers to my wife for easter and picked up some pizza to 
bring back to the ship with us he said 
did you stop at any other establishments in town liquor 
places or bars asked delozier 
well we went by the pipeline club to see if anybody off the 
ship was in there if we knew anybody nobody there so we left 
and picked up the pizza he said 
he denied drinking anything at the valdez bar where witnesses 
said they saw him ordering vodka 
hazelwood said he had one real beer before boarding the ship 
and one or two phony nearly nonalcoholic beers before the 
exxon valdez sailed 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is charged with 
seconddegree criminal mischief a felony and three misdemeanors 
reckless endangerment operating a vessel while intoxicated and 
negligent discharge of oil

a prominent black businessman who purchased a 
bankrupt college founded by freed slaves and missionaries called on 
the citys black community to help him make the school a success 
again 
i waited until the last minute for someone or some group to 
come through and buy it said comer cottrell after buying the 
bishop colleges entire 130acre campus on friday but no one 
floated to the surface 
it would have been a real blow to the developing black 
community here if the school was dissolved now we need a 
commitment from the blacks that they will help make it work 
cottrell bought the college for 15 million in a liquidation 
auction 
sobbing with joy cottrell called the acquisition of dallas 
only predominantly black college his moral duty 
cottrell owns dallasbased proline corp the nations 18th 
largest blackowned company which sells more than 30 million a 
year in haircare products for blacks 
what happened to the school is criminal cottrell said as 
the past vice chairman of the school i had to go through the 
agony pain and heartache of the demise of the college 
cottrell said he will reopen the 108yearold school as soon as 
a board of trustees is in place and construction crews clean up the 
decaying campus 
we will turn the institution around to benefit the whole of 
the community especially the black youth he said 
cottrell 58 opened the bidding at 12 million friday 
afternoon and said after purchasing the college that he had been 
willing to go even higher 
i was prepared to pay 5 million so 15 million is quite a 
bargain he said 
the auction lasted less than five minutes cottrell was one of 
two bidders but officials refused to release the name of the other 
bidder 
bishop college which is named after union army col nathan 
bishop a white man was founded in marshall texas in 1881 by 
nine freed slaves and a group of baptist missionaries 
the college was moved to dallas from marshall in 1961 
state senator eddie bernice johnson of dallas said last week 
state school officials are investigating whether the institution 
should be resurrected as a teachers college 
cottrell who received an honorary degree from bishop said the 
school will maintain its name but he was unsure if the school 
would become a teachers college or remain an undergraduate 
institution 
as long as it serves the black community thats all that 
matters he said 
the school which suffered from bungled management for more than 
a decade was closed in august 1988 by a federal bankruptcy judge 
after the school failed to raise enough money to subsist 
bob mottern an attorney representing duke salisbury the 
trustee appointed to oversee the liquidation of bishops assets 
said the money from the sale will go to pay legal fees and salaries 
of employees released when the school closed down 
cottrell said he is seeking investors to help him pay for the 
school

hundreds of mourners today thronged a church 
to pay respects to former president jose napoleon duarte who tried 
and failed to ease the searing class divisions that sparked a 
crippling decadeold civil war 
duarte died at his home friday after a long battle with cancer 
he was 64 
two of duartes six children alejandro and napoleon 
accompanied by leaders of the christian democratic party he helped 
found carried his flagdraped coffin to the don rua roman catholic 
church in the bluecollar neighborhood of san miguelito 
military school cadets escorted the procession 
about 500 mourners many carrying flowers awaited them at the 
church where duartes body was to lie in state until the funeral 
sunday 
mourners many of them poor continued to arrive early today 
while hundreds of others blocked streets outside the church police 
cordoned off the area 
duarte was everything for us the women of the markets for 
all the poor for us he will live forever said one woman 
trying to reach the coffin she asked not to be identified 
us and regional leaders praised duartes dedication to 
democracy 
president duarte was the father of salvadoran democracy a 
dedicated servant to the people of el salvador and a firm friend 
of the united states said a statement issued in washington by 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
vice president dan quayle will lead the us delegation at 
duartes funeral the white house said 
secretary of state james a baker iii said there could be no 
more fitting tribute to his memory than for his countrymen to 
follow his lead and to ensure that human rights and democratic 
institutions grow and strengthen in the country he loved so deeply 
and to which he gave so much 
duarte was born in san salvador nov 23 1925 the second of 
three sons of a tailor father and dressmaker mother 
he graduated from the university of notre dame in 1948 with a 
degree in civil engineering married a childhood friend ines 
duran and worked in her familys construction business 
he served three terms as mayor of san salvador he was winning 
the presidential election in february 1972 when the army stopped 
the count and declared its candidate the winner 
after supporting a failed coup attempt a few weeks later duarte 
was arrested beaten and sent into exile in venezuela where he 
spent more than seven years 
after reformminded military officers seized power in a 1979 
coup duarte returned to el salvador and in 1980 he became 
president of the ruling junta 
duarte tried to institute a land reform and other economic 
changes but these were hampered by growing violence from leftist 
guerrillas the military and militarylinked rightists all of 
whom tried to destabilize his fragile government 
elected president in 1984 duarte enjoyed wide popularity and 
opened peace talks with the guerrillas that year 
the negotiations failed however and a plague of problems that 
accompanied the war accusations of corruption economic failure 
a devastating 1986 earthquake parching drought overwhelmed his 
government 
in may 1988 doctors diagnosed the cancer and removed 60 percent 
of duartes stomach but the disease had spread to his liver they 
gave him from six to 18 months to live 
he finished his fiveyear term but his last public appearance 
was the inauguration last year of his successor alfredo cristiani 
the rightist president whose party represented the oligarchy duarte 
had struggled against 
duartes death said venezuelan president carlos andres perez 
leaves a gap in the ranks of the great forgers of latin american 
democracy and most especially in central america 
col rene emilio ponce head of el salvadors armed forces 
chiefs of staff said history would remember duarte as a fighter 
who had all the forces necessary to carry out a democratic 
process 
it is the loss of a person who fought all his life for the 
democratization of the country ponce said as he arrived at the 
church 
ricardo alvarenga president of the legislative assembly and a 
member of the rightist republican nationalist alliance that 
defeated duartes party in 1988 and 1989 elections had no praise 
for duarte even in death 
today we political adversaries arent going to slight him 
alvarenga said he will be judged by god and i hope god will have 
forgiven him 
a highranking us diplomat who served in el salvador during 
most of duartes term said of him he didnt work miracles but 
he must be credited with instituting the democratic system itself 
his great legacy is the transition the rest pales by comparison

and firstdegree wanton endangerment 12 counts of firstdegree 
assault 14 of seconddegree wanton endangerment and one of drunken 
driving 
defense lawyer william summers urged satterwhite to grant 
probation to bring something positive from the tragedy the defense 
recommended a probation plan under which mahoney would have 
lectured schoolchildren about the dangers of drunken driving 
served volunteer time in hospital emergency wards and spent one 
year in a work release program 
judge we must do as much good with this as we possibly can 
his punishment has already been dealt he already has been given a 
life sentence summers said referring to mahoneys suffering 
since the crash 
but prosecutor paul richwalsky jr of the state attorney 
generals office vehemently opposed probation saying regardless 
of statements the defense would make its time for punishment 
mahoney alone is responsible he alone brought us to this 
place today he said 
jim daugherty mahoneys brotherinlaw said the chemical plant 
worker had held out some hope for probation but was not 
particularly upset 
hes resigned himself to it i think daugherty said 
parents of some of the 24 children killed in the crash held a 
news conference after the sentencing to urge passage of a package 
of stiff drunkendriving laws pending in the kentucky general 
assembly 
some of the victims and their families expressed satisfaction 
mahoney was sentenced while others said wounds from the tragedy 
were slow to heal 
probation would have left a real sour taste in my mouth 
said mickey muller whose daughter katrina was injured in the 
crash our poor children dont have probation 
this is not over today said gary atherton whose daughter 
cynthia died in the fiery wreck its not over for the rest of 
our lives 
during the trial jurors heard mahoney issue a dramatic public 
apology 
he said he had no recollection of colliding with the bus and 
broke down into tears when disfigured survivors testified of horror 
and panic inside the flaming bus 
the collision punctured the buss gas tank shooting a stream of 
flaming gasoline inside the bus 
defense attorneys argued the bus was unsafe because of 
insufficent safety exits and had a fuel tank placed in a 
crashprone location 
they also contended fireretardant seat cushions and covers 
could have limited the fires rapid spread and the toxic smoke 
which passengers inhaled

who intervened with banking officials on behalf of lincoln savings 
and loan 
edwin j gray former chairman of the federal home loan bank

gray declined to discuss his testimony 
all five senators under scrutiny alan cranston dcalif 
dennis deconcini dariz john mccain rariz donald w riegle 
jr dmich and john glenn dohio have denied wrongdoing the 
committees investigation is still in its preliminary stage 
sources familiar with the overall investigation said the 
committee appears to be exploring all possible relationships 
between the senators and phoenix millionaire charles h keating 
jr the former head of lincoln based in irvine calif 
gray testified last november that four of the senators asked 
him in a private meeting on april 2 1987 to drop a proposed 
regulation that would have curtailed risky investments by lincoln

their friend keating to make more home loans

air force secretary donald rice says a 
congressional report contending his service had grossly understated 
the costs of major weapons was hypercritical and inflammatory 
the report offers a narrow cpas view of the information 
needed for defense decisionmaking that has limited relationship to 
the real problems of defense management rice said in a 
threepage letter to the head of the general accounting office 
charles bowsher 
the letter was released friday the same day bowsher told a 
senate committee friday the air forces accounting system fails to 
provide accurate cost data for almost 80 percent of its weapons 
inventory and equipment 
we roughly estimate that equipment and missiles are misstated 
by billions of dollars and aircraft and inventories are misstated 
by tens of billions of dollars he told the senate governmental 
affairs committee 
bowsher testified as the gao released its 109page audit of the 
air forces accounting and financial management system 
sen john glenn dohio and chairman of the panel noted that 
the gao chose to audit the air force because it is the only armed 
service to develop financial statements that are in accord with 
accounting practices elsewhere in the federal government 
if the air force does indeed have the best financial 
management system among the services then the audit results are an 
indictment of the financial management systems of the whole 
department of defense the army the navy as well as the air 
force glenn said 
the ohio democrat also used the hearing to question bowsher 
about rices previously unreleased feb 15 letter to him 
the air force secretary wrote that the service volunteered to 
work with the gao on the audit and in return the gao writes a 
hypercritical and inflammatory report 
i urge you to send your team back to the drawing board with 
instructions to prepare a report that fairly evaluates the pros and 
cons of gaos approach and which uses air force data only as a test 
case for a new approach rice said

six vietnamese were granted legal permission 
today to challenge the screening process that decides which boat 
people are to be returned to their communist homeland against their 
will government radio said 
the six maintain that the screening system is flawed and unjust 
the report said 
the british colony in an attempt to discourage vietnamese from 
sailing here considers all boat people to be illegal immigrants 
unless they can prove a wellfounded fear of persecution back home 
under the screening process which has been criticized by some 
human rights groups each vietnamese is interviewed by immigration 
officers who decide whether the applicant is a refugee or illegal 
immigrant 
a final decision is made by an appeal board that sits in private 
and does not have to explain its decisions boat people are not 
present at the appeal hearings 
about 10 percent of the boat people who have gone through the 
process have been granted refugee status according to government 
statistics the rest are to be sent home 
a first group of 51 boat people were repatriated against their 
will in december but no more vietnamese have been forced back 
since because of objections raised by the united states and hanoi 
the radio did not say when the court hearing for the six will 
take place their case could have signficant repercussions on the 
screening process

elizabeth morgan will seek an open court 
hearing in new zealand where she sent her daughter into hiding on 
allegations that her husband abused 7yearold hilary her family 
says 
the truth will have a lot of chance of coming out elizabeth 
morgans older brother was quoted as saying in todays editions of 
the washington post 
morgan who spent 25 months in jail rather than let her former 
husband visit the girl told the post she is hoping for a new 
hearing on her allegations that eric foretich sexually abused the 
girl during courtordered visits in the washington area foretich 
has strongly denied the charges and contends his former wife is 
mentally ill 
detective chief inspector roger carson of christchurch new 
zealand said the girl is in the custody of her grandparents there 
and that there will be a hearing on the issue next week in the 
citys family court 
ive not felt the legal system in washington dc had 
listened to the evidence morgan told the newspaper i didnt 
think i ever said that i trusted no legal system 
her lawyer stephen sachs said he will ask district of columbia 
superior court judge herbert dixon on monday to return morgans 
passport so she can go to new zealand 
dixon is the judge who odered morgan 42 to jail in august 1987 
for civil contempt when she refused to a court order to produce 
hilary for supervised visits with foretich she was released from 
jail in washington in september after president bush signed a law 
limiting civil contempt in district of columbia child abuse cases 
to 12 months 
foretich said he was elated that his daughter has been found 
and appears to be at least physically well 
i would hope to obtain custody he said in a telephone 
interview thats obviously why i want to bring her back to 
washington i want to bring her back to the court in washington 
where she belongs 
but he said he has no illusions that gaining custody of the girl 
will be easy 
elizabeth morgan is going to wage the same media battle 
that shes always done in the past he said she is undoubtedly 
a media person shes a media queen and she creates this illusion 
that im some kind of a pervert and shes going to try to do that 
down there as well and use the media to do it in hopes that that 
will influence the court 
foretich said he resents the publicity as much for his daughter 
as for himself i dont think its fair for my daughter to 
have her life made unnecessarily more public than it needs to 
be he said 
elizabeth is going to do whatever she possibly can do to 
protect her daughter sachs told the post elizabeth is 
confident that the courts of new zealand will protect hilary 
elizabeth morgan in the post interview declined to predict how 
the new court proceedings will go i think time will tell she 
said its early days 
but james morgan her older brother said she wants to introduce 
in open court the allegations of abuse that us courts ruled 
against 
were awfully happy that were going to have an open hearing 
in an open court unlike the district where everything was 
closed james morgan said

i found my daughter with the help of investigative 
reporters he said i made several trips to england where i 
found information out 
last week his lawyers obtained a court order in england that 
instructed the producer of a british talk show to investigate the 
girls whereabouts after a caller said she recognized the girls

the ruling sandinista party is hoping 
that an election certified as fair by international observers will 
force the united states to end a decade of hostility even if the 
us favorite loses 
that would be a difficult adjustment for the united states 
which views the sandinistas as a disturbing and destabilizing 
leftist factor in the region and for the sandinistas who have 
viewed the united states as an aggressor and an advocate of 
socially regressive policies 
they will both have to change said erick ramirez the 
social christian partys presidential candidate in an interview 
us support is taken for granted if violeta barrios de chamorro 
pulls what would be a stunning upset over president daniel ortega 
us aid is anticipated even if the united national opposition cuts 
a deal that gives the sandinistas control of the army and the 
interior ministrys police powers 
but if the sandinistas win it will be more problematic 
the sandinistas are desperate for us recognition which would 
pave the way for an end to the ussponsored contra guerrilla 
movement trigger negotiations with the bush adminstration and 
eventually bring in us aid and development dollars 
but the first thing we need from the united states is peace 
ortega campaign manager bayardo arce said thursday 
earlier thursday secretary of state james a baker iii said the 
united states will not automaticallay accept the judgments of 
international observers even people like former president jimmy 
carter 
as a second hedge he laid down a set of conditions in 
anticipation of a legitimate sandinista victory 
there will be no normalization until we see a substantial 
period of good behavior by the government including a halt to 
support for leftist rebels in el salvador and political freedom for 
the opposition in nicaragua baker said 
roman catholic cardinal miguel obando y bravo once a harsh 
critic of the sandinistas said the united states should recognize 
the winner and start discussions with the new government 
nicaragua needs peace and development badly obando y bravo 
said and that can only come with us help 
at a thursday press conference ortega was careful to be 
conciliatory even in the face of bakers comments refusing to 
discuss bakers conditions and saying he hoped to initiate 
negotiations with the united states after he was reelected 
in todays editions of the new york times he was quoted as 
saying he would not provide arms to salvadoran guerrillas after the 
elections and he called el salvadors rightist government 
legitimate 
a senior nicaraguan official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
voiced the sandinistas devout hope when he said president 
bush already threw a bone to the us radical conservatives by 
invading panama he can afford to talk to nicaragua now without 
looking weak 
during the past year the sandinistas have tried to shed their 
image as radical marxists 
the sandinistas have pledged there will be no more 
expropriations of private property repeatedly told private 
business they want a mixed economy released political prisoners 
and reduced friction with the powerful roman catholic church 
obando y bravo once a bitter critic said the sandinistas 
have changed i believe there are some pragmatic people in the 
government circumstances here and abroad are forcing the fsln 
sandinistas to change 
he was referring to the effects of liberalization and economic 
problems in eastern europe since soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
took power 
on a practical level the changes mean reduced subsidies and 
arms for nicaragua on an intellectual and political level they 
mean communism is no longer a credible alternative 
arce said some sandinista economic policies of the past 10 years 
may have been wrong 
a local joke has it that the sandinistas will win to carry out 
the uno economic program although ortega says he disagrees with 
policies that might lead to massive unemployment 
ortega also said thursday that the united states should stop 
assisting the contra guerrillas before pointing a finger at 
nicaragua although the us halted arms shipments to them in 1988 
nonlethal aid continues 
only about 3500 rebels are thought to remain inside nicaragua 
the aid comes up for renewal after sundays election 
the problem is that the united states has stayed with a 
contradictory international policy they are getting closer to the 
eastern european countries undergoing political reforms but those 
types of reforms exist in nicaragua already said victor hugo 
tinoco the deputy foreign minister in an interview

firefighters safely removed a leaky container 
of flammable gas aboard a cargo ship clearing the way for the 
reopening of one of the worlds busiest seaports 
the harbor was reopened shortly before midnight friday said pat 
marek a fire department spokesman the closure had affected harbor 
traffic for about 24 hours 
a 1mile stretch of the main channel of the los angeles harbor 
was closed after gas was found to be leaking from a 2000pound 
cylinder deep in the cargo hold of a freighter 
firefighters on friday night began removing containers from the 
ships cargo hold to reach the leaking container of 
trifluoropropene marek said 
we were able to get down into the ship to determine the 
explosive environment fire battalion chief leon pursell said 
we found it to be free of the flammable liquids that allowed 
us to get in there and start to remove the containers 
the leaking container was about 40 feet down in the cargo hold 
of the 882foot taiwanese vessel owned by evergreen shipping co 
the closure was the first in 12 years at the nations top 
container shipping port 
coast guard officials said the harbor shutdown did not affect 
the harbors vital container ship traffic as much as pleasure boat 
traffic 
most of the container ships were already at anchor and 
unloading when officials discovered the gas leak coast guard 
petty officer tim rowe said 
however two cruise ships which normally use the channel to 
load and unload passengers were forced to berth at adjacent long 
beach harbor

general motors corp is scaling back production 
at three assembly plants idling about 4200 workers 
the layoffs announced friday are part of a wave of cutbacks by 
major automakers in a season of slow sales 
starting monday gm said it will eliminate one of two shifts at 
each of its car assembly plants in doraville ga and linden 
nj resulting in 1900 and 1600 layoffs respectively the 
nations largest automaker also will trim production at its 
assembly plant in fairfax kan causing about 700 layoffs 
theres an air of despondency said guy messina a shop 
chairman for united auto workers local 595 in linden where 
chevrolet corsica and beretta cars are made it finally sunk in 
that these are their last days 
but the expected idling of other autoworkers will be put off 
gm said friday the planned midmarch shutdown of the lakewood 
assembly plant in atlanta would be pushed back to between april 1 
and july 1 because of a pickup in sales of buick estate station 
wagons and 1990 chevrolet caprice cars 
chrysler spokesman doug nicoll said friday that layoffs of 750 
employees at an assembly plant in belvidere ill where luxury 
cars are made and 780 layoffs at its factory in newark del 
where dodge spirit and plymouth acclaim cars are assembled will be 
put off indefinitely the layoffs originally were scheduled to take 
effect march 19 
ford motor co has avoided indefinite layoffs by increasing its 
capacity during the boom years of 198588 through overtime at 
existing plants rather than opening new factories 
automakers use plant shutdowns and production reductions to 
bring factory output in line with the inventories of new unsold 
cars on dealer and plant lots automakers have said they expect 
slower sales through at least the first half of this year with a 
rebound later 
sales tumbled in october as the 1990 model year began in 
january the pace picked up mainly because of incentives on 
chryslers popular minivans those offers expired jan 31 and the 
rate of sales since then has fallen 
on friday the big three reported their midfebruary sales of 
cars and light trucks were running 158 percent behind last years 
pace since jan 1 with effects of chrysler minivan incentives 
figured in the sales pace was running 02 percent ahead of last 
year 
throughout january the big three automakers shut down dozens of 
their plants for at least a week apiece to cut inventory the move 
apparently worked as inventory levels fell from around 90 selling 
days worth at the end of december to about 70 days at the end last 
month 
but thats not enough to stop the layoffs 
like gm chrysler is shutting down entire plants this year its 
jefferson assembly factory in detroit closed feb 2 resulting in 
1700 layoffs and its st louis car plant cut a shift earlier this 
month and will shut down totally sept 21 in all 3700 st louis 
employees will be laid off 
workers placed on indefinite layoff status may qualify for a 
variety of programs designed to give them temporary benefits equal 
to about 95 percent of their takehome pay however uaw officials 
have said that the benefit funds are currently lower than what is 
needed to maintain that compensation level

poland will issue a 100000 zloty note as 
part of efforts to accommodate the soaring inflation that has 
accompanied economic reform the official news agency pap reported 
today 
the banknote to be introduced monday will be worth 1050 the 
report said it is the second largest in circulation after the 
recently introduced 200000 zloty note 
the polish national bank note was being produced in december but 
had to be redesigned after the countrys name was changed from the 
polish peoples republic to the republic of poland the news agency 
said 
the banknote honors stanislaw moniuszko a 19th century opera 
composer 
poland has been struggling with triple digit inflation since 
last year following the lifting of controls that had kept prices 
unrealistically low through government subsidies to unprofitable 
state enterprises 
in january alone the inflation rate was about 79 percent but 
economists forecast an easing of inflation during the next six 
months as efforts to transform the socialist economy into a 
marketdriven system take hold

the governing party proposed japan spend hundreds 
of millions of dollars on foreign rice over five years but use the 
rice only for foreign aid and not on the heavily subsidized 
domestic market officials said today 
millions of tons of rice would be purchased mainly from the 
united states thailand and singapore said takashi sato chairman 
of the liberal democratic partys comprehensive agriculture 
research commission who proposed the plan 
the 680 million plan calls for construction of rice stockpiles 
in each country filled with rice purchased by japan said hajime 
kondo an aide to sato 
kondo said the project would show japans willingness to buy 
rice and contribute to those suffering but not to import foreign 
rice for domestic consumption 
we will never liberalize rice imports we will never ever 
allow a single foreign rice grain into our nation kondo said 
the government regulates the domestic rice market buying much 
of the rice crop and reselling it to consumers at subsidized 
prices those prices are still several times higher than the world 
market level 
satos plan proposed to begin in april 1991 calls for foreign 
rice to be added to the list of items to be donated to countries 
requiring emergency support the japanese red cross society will 
handle the donations he said 
we dont want to just give away money and be seen as 
arrogant kondo said 
the government budgeted 68000 during fiscal 1990 for 
feasibility studies 
japan has been trying to persuade its trading partners to accept 
its existing agricultural trade policy in the current uruguay round 
of multilateral trade talks without success so far 
in september 1988 both houses of parliament unanimously adopted 
a nonbinding resolution against opening the nations rice market 
to foreign imports the resolution said rice production was vital 
for local communities the preservation of land and japanese 
culture

one might think maines largest city 
would have snow removal refined to an art form bng snow into a shorefront 
mountain 
but officials now acknowledge that the mass of dirty ice will 
carry some of the sand and salt into the cove which drains into 
casco bay already one of the regions most polluted harbors 
the state and city reached a twoyear agreement that calls for 
the snow to be piled up next to the cove while the city conducts an 
environmental impact study 
state environmental officials were concerned especially about 
keeping the sand out of the cove in order to comply with pollution 
standards set up the us army corps of engineers 
hydrocarbon tests on the snow and a study of clams mussels and 
microorganisms in the area should be completed by spring 
portland public works director george flaherty hopes by then to 
have convinced the state that it is safe to dump the snow into the 
bay instead of piling it high 
we felt it hasnt caused a problem he said 
phil garwood of the state department of environmental 
protection who does not think the city should dump any snow into 
the bay said the snow pile will lessen the pollutants that go into 
the waters because the mountain is surrounded by a finemesh fence 
the fence is designed to let melting snow get through while 
trapping large particles of dirt and pollutants 
some of the trash will no doubt blow into back cove he said 
garwood said some canadian cities are better at handling their 
polluted snow than their us counterparts quebec for example 
has a snow dump that resembles a coliseum where the snow is 
allowed to melt and the remaining particles of pollutants are then 
disposed of 
but portland has nowhere but the bay to put the snow because 
most city land is used as parks where salt from the snow could 
harm vegetation and ground water flaherty said 
the mountain also has developed into an eyesore some say 
i think its pretty disgusting said beth ravenelle a 
teacher from saco who has watched the pile of snow and debris get 
taller and taller during her frequent jogs along the water 
weve just watched this thing grow all winter said another 
jogger john williams a local scientist who sometimes makes his 
exercise course more interesting by running right over the mound of 
snow that has been packed into a hard ice by 35ton bulldozers 
the mountain of ice has grown so big that officials expect it to 
last until midsummer this season so far has brought 583 inches 
of snow 31 inches more than normal for portland 
my guess is probably midjuly flaherty said he said city 
hall workers talk of setting up their own betting pool for 
predicting the demise of the mound they have christened 
flahertys mountain 
you might as well call it something flaherty said i have 
another name for it but we sure dont put it in the press

the three major television networks and cable 
news network have agreed to create a single exit poll for election 
days according to a published report 
two senior network officials told the new york times that the 
networks agreed to cooperate to cut costs and to avoid the 
competition that has resulted in predictions of winners before all 
votes are cast 
cbs nbc abc and cnn are to be equal partners in the group 
which is to be called voter research and surveys the times said in 
todays editions 
each network is to receive the same information at the same time 
on election days the newspaper said 
a public announcement is expected next week spokesmen for the 
four networks said they could not officially confirm the agreement 
the times said 
observers said the group polling would cut down on the 
competition to be the first network to declare a winner 
theres a public perception that such early projections are a 
disenfranchisement of the west coast since results have been 
announced there before voting concluded said eleanor singer a 
research scientist at columbia university 
but the newspaper quoted network executives as saying that 
saving money was the driving force behind the pooled polling each 
network will chip in 3 million to operate the service on primary 
and general election days until the next presidential election in 
1992 
one executive said a single network might spend 12 million on 
polling in that time 
it was unclear how the arrangement will affect other news 
organizations such as newspapers who have teamed up with networks 
in past polls

a city council resolution to study whether 
distributing illegal drugs free would cut down on crime has drawn 
ridicule from politicians and law enforcement officials 
councilman john street offered the resolution thursday calling 
for reports on the legal and medical implications of a drug 
distribution system the resolution was routinely and unanimously 
approved without discussion 
but some councilmen said later they were unaware of the 
resolutions content and denounced the measure one councilman 
said the resolution would go to a committee and stay there 
what they are proposing is a violation of state law and a 
violation of federal law district attorney ronald castille said 
friday if they try to distribute free cocaine and other drugs to 
anyone they will be arrested 
mayor w wilson goode urged the council to reconsider saying 
the study would waste his administrations time and siphon money 
away from drug treatment and education programs 
pennsylvania attorney general ernest preate called the 
resolution absurb 
youre going to be diverting people who should be out there in 
the fight against drugs to find ways to make philadelphia the drug 
capital of the united states he said 
the resolution calls for reports from the citys police and 
health commissioners prison and school superintendents judges and 
district attorney on the legal and medical implications of giving 
addicts drugs at low or no cost to see if they can be cured of 
their habit 
i think other tools should be brought into the arsenal of 
government against this terrible drug situation street said 
its stupid its nuts said councilwoman joan krajewski 
councilman james tayoun said hes an idiot 
but councilman thacher longstreth thinks the idea is worth a 
shot 
we had a treatment program using methadone to help heroin 
users and that didnt do well longstreth said but its 
always worth investigating my initial reaction is maybe its time 
to experiment again 
street insisted he was not advocating the legalization of drugs 
we dont have enough treatment we dont have enough police 
we dont have enough courtrooms to try those arrested we dont 
have enough jails so theres got to be additional things to do 
he said 
my idea is strictly to look into the idea of legalizing drugs 
for treatment purposes only 
councilman lucien blackwell said the resolution would be 
assigned to the health committee for a hearing and will not emerge 
we do have a drug problem i think we should discuss it but 
giving drug users more drugs to wean them off drugs wont work you 
got to cut if off entirely blackwell said

a 300 mph bullet train that uses magnetic 
levitation will become the transportation of choice for 150 to 
300mile trips in the united states a group that hopes to develop 
the trains says 
the trains appear to be the best highspeed ground 
transportation technology based on cost environmental impact 
speed comfort and readiness james roddey acting president of 
maglev inc said friday 
what we presently consider the communter airline market 
represents the magnetic levitation market said roddey an 
advertising executive 
maglev inc a group of business labor and government leaders 
was formed to develop a 19mile demonstration project linking 
downtown pittsburgh to greater pittsburgh international airport 
the maglev train hovers on a magnetic field over an elevated 
guideway using technology devised in the united states in 1968 and 
improved in west germany train cars have no wheels and wrap around 
a guide rail preventing the train from derailing 
the group has completed a preliminary study on the feasibility 
of magnetic levitation in pittsburgh and is trying to raise 21 
million for a more detailed study roddey said 
what we want to do in the pittsburgh area is become a 
technological and manufacturing base for magnetic levitation in the 
united states roddey said 
richard uher director of carnegie mellon universitys high 
speed ground transportation center said maglev could create a 
whole new industry here 
the 12 members of maglev inc have agreed to invest 900000 for 
the study which will take 2 years to finish an additional 
300000 will come from the state roddey said 
the maglev promotion council a japanese trading company has 
committed about 250000 he said and the company is applying for 
12 million from federal officials 
the airport project could be completed as early as 1996 roddey 
said it would cost 300 million to 650 million to design and 
build depending on the route and whether a single or double track 
system is built

recent statements from iran and lebanon 
have given syria great hope that western hostages in lebanon 
will be released syrias information minister said today 
but mohammed salam cautioned the sister of american hostage 
terry a anderson not to expect a quick release of her brother and 
the 17 other westerners believed to be held 
the matter requires careful study and patience as well as 
coordination of efforts with international and local parties we 
are following this road he told peggy say who is on her fifth 
tour of the region in hopes of securing the hostages release 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press is the longestheld of the western hostages he was 
kidnapped in moslem west beirut on march 16 1985 
salmans optimism stemmed from a statement made friday in beirut 
by sheik mohammed hussein fadlalah the most influential shiite 
moslem cleric in lebanon he appealed for a new approach to free 
the hostages 
fadlallah who recently returned from a visit to tehran with 
senior iranian leaders spoke the day after an editorial in the 
tehran times which usually reflects the thinking of president 
hashemi rafsanjani urged that the hostages be freed it was the 
first time an iranian newspaper has made such a statement 
we have to think of finding realistic and humanitarian means 
to free the foreign hostages fadlallah said in a sermon on the 
moslem holy day 
the hostage issue has been widely exploited by western forces 
to harm the image of moslems fadlallah said 
he is the spiritual guide to the iranianaligned hezbollah or 
party of god which is believed to be an umbrella organization for 
groups holding most of the westerners missing in lebanon 
salman praised the statements 
we have great hope now that we can work with all concerned to 
secure the release of the hostages he said 
earlier statements from iran and shiite leaders in lebanon about 
a possible hostage release were not made in such a serious 
manner he said 
syria with 40000 troops in lebanon is the main power broker 
in that country the syrians have been instrumental in securing the 
release of some western hostages over the past five years and 
played a role in other releases syria is irans main ally in the 
region 
salman said syria would be proud if we were able to secure 
release of any hostage regardless of his nationality 
he said syria is categorically opposed to kidnapping 
neither terry anderson nor any other hostage is responsible 
for the problems of the area and kidnapping cannot solve these 
problems salman said 
mrs say told him i know in my heart that syrias conviction 
to gain the release of the hostages is total 
mrs say is on a tour with an associated press delegation to

with an eye toward ending a half 
century of soviet rule lithuanians today voted for a new 
legislature that could be led by noncommunists and will 
undoubtedly seek independence for the baltic republic 
the reformed lithuanian communist party which broke with moscow 
and advocated independence for the republic made a strong bid to 
retain power 
it is unclear whether soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev will 
allow the soviet republic to break away but some political leaders 
expect lithuania to proclaim independence as early as this summer 
the lithuanian communist party broke from the national party in 
december 
at least six legal parties and the frontrunner sajudis popular 
movement are vying for seats in the republics 141member supreme 
soviet lithuania in december also became the first of the soviet 
unions 15 republics to legalize parties other than the communist 
party 
this day is a line between the past and the future said 
vytautus landsbergis chairman of sajudis shortly before marking 
his paper ballot at a high school in vilnius the capital 
polls opened at 8 am midnight est and were to close at 8 
pm noon est the official tass news agency said officials said 
they expect the first preliminary results sunday with official 
results available tuesday 
voters lined up to vote under clear skies and 50degree 
temperatures 
i think these elections will mean independence for lithuania 
but they are only a first step said rimantis jankauskas an 
employee of vilnius university clutching his young daughters hand 
after he voted 
we must be realistic about this he said we are still on 
the very beginning of a very long road of negotiations with 
moscow 
about 30 men marked soviet army day in vilnius on friday by 
turning in their military id cards saying they refused to serve 
in an occupation army 
a newspaper quoted algirdas brazauskas leader of the republics 
communist party as saying last week all of lithuania seeks an 
independent state the reestablishment of statehood is the central 
aim of the rebirth of our people 
in 1940 the soviet union absorbed the three baltic republics 
lithuania estonia and latvia under a secret agreement in which 
josef stalin and adolf hitler divided central europe between them 
they had been independent for 22 years 
the government chosen by the new legislature will seek to 
negotiate an orderly departure from the soviet union said 
landsbergis 
sajudis which has attracted hundreds of thousands of people to 
rallies in this republic of 36 million people is the clear leader 
in todays election 
it supports about 30 candidates of the lithuanian communist 
party 
sajudis and the lithuanian communist party are contesting nearly 
every seat members of the promoscow alternate communist party 
including candidates from lithuanias 200000 ethnic russian 
minority are running in 78 districts 
many smaller parties with smaller slates of candidates sprang up 
during the campaign including the social democrats democrats 
greens and christian democrats 
a total of 475 candidates are running for the 141 seats and 
only eight are unopposed under gorbachevs political reforms there 
are no guaranteed seats for communists 
canadian parliamentarians invited by sajudis are to monitor 
the election bob rae a member of the canadian delegation said 
moscow refused visas to several us congressmen when they claimed 
the status of official observers 
foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev said visas were 
denied because the americans did not have official invitations he 
said they could visit the soviet union later 
a few campaign signs were up friday outside sajudis 
headquarters in vilnius the capital a steady stream of people 
examined the posted election information and pictures of candidates 
sajudis leaders say they are not breaking away from the soviet 
union so much as reclaiming a sovereignty usurped illegally 
after the red army occupied lithuania the parliament was 
coerced into voting to join the soviet union which formally 
annexed it on aug 24 1940 
the baltic states became independent in 1918 after the collapse 
of russia and germany in world war i

the ruling communist party has agreed to 
remove its representatives from the workplace a key demand by the 
democratic opposition and to postpone elections by one month 
informed sources said today 
the communists supreme council at the same closeddoor meeting 
friday also decided to let communists vote on whether to change 
the name of their party to the bulgarian socialists party the 
state bta news agency said 
all communist party members would be eligible to vote in the may 
plebiscite bta said communist parties in soviet bloc countries 
further along the road to democracy already have reformed as 
socialists professing democratic ideals in an attempt to win 
support ahead of multiparty elections 
the supreme council agreed in principle to abandon the communist 
partys right to organize in factories enterprises and 
administrative units sources said 
the council which replaced the policysetting central committee 
under a decision by a recent party congress proposed the measure 
be included in a new law on parties expected to be adopted during a 
national assembly session beginning march 5 
the supreme council proposed to hold bulgarias first multiparty 
elections in june not in may as previously announced however the 
opposition has repeatedly demanded that elections be held in 
november the sources said 
talks between the communists and the opposition union of 
democratic forces and other political and social groups were 
suspended feb 12 because of disagreement over the party cells and 
other political demands 
the talks began after longtime communist strongman todor zhivkov 
was toppled nov 10 
the agreement to get communist representatives out of the 
workplace was welcomed by opposition representatives as a positive 
step 
it is a good sign because the communist party understands that 
they must do something to show their commitment to democratic 
change said alexander karakachanov a member of the opposition 
coalition and president of the bulgarian greens party 
however karakachanov who was reached by telephone from vienna 
said he believed the opposition would still go ahead with a protest 
rally sunday in downtown sofia maybe not at the same level as 
originally planned 
in a statement read on national television friday the 
opposition urged citizens to attend the weekend rally to protest 
the communists stalling on reforms 
the declaration read on tv by georgi spassov the spokesman for 
the opposition coalition also proclaimed the days until march 3 as 
days of protest and struggle for freedom and democracy 
in another concession to the opposition the supreme council 
proposed that in future the national holiday should be march 3 not 
sept 9 
since 1944 the national day has been sept 9 when a national 
front dominated by the communists took over on march 3 1878 
under a peace treaty signed between turkey and russia bulgaria 
became independent after nearly 500 years of ottoman turkish rule

a halt in shipments of chinese 
weapons crippled an offensive by cambodian guerrillas and allowed 
government forces to retake a strategic northwestern town fighters 
and western diplomats have said 
senior guerrilla officials also said france halted secret arms 
supplies to one of the rebel groups fighting the communist 
cambodian government after the covert program was publicized 
france denied such shipments were made 
china has been the main supplier of arms to three of the groups 
fighting the vietnameseinstalled government and the guerrillas 
said in interviews that the halt in shipments is unprecedented in 
11 years of fighting 
it was unclear whether the suspension indicated a policy 
decision or logistical problems a chinese diplomat in bangkok 
speaking on condition of anonymity as most of the other sources 
did last month denied there was any change in support for the 
resistance 
the khmer peoples national liberation front said it has not 
received chinese shipments in three months and prince norodom 
sihanouks group also has reported shortages it was not known 
whether supplies to the communist khmer rouge chinas main ally in 
the resistance coalition were affected 
gen pan thai chief of staff of the khmer peoples national 
liberation front on friday blamed the loss of the northwestern 
town of svay chek to cambodian troops on the shortage of arms 
svay chek a gateway to the government military operations 
center at sisophon and biggest prize of the fronts recent 
offensive was retaken friday in the governments first major 
victory 
the government could never have taken back svay chek if we 
had the ammo pan thai said in an interview at aranyaprathet a 
thai border town we would have taken sisophon a long time ago 
we have nothing no mortars rockets nothing we have asked 
the chinese many times since december but nothing pan thai said 
a western diplomat in bangkok on friday confirmed the halt in 
shipments and agreed it had crippled the guerrilla offensive 
the guerrillas had seized a wide swath of territory along the 
thai border since late september when vietnam said it withdrew its 
last troops the liberation front seized svay chek dec 5 and said 
it was pushing toward sisophon but fighting decreased in recent 
weeks 
some liberation front commanders said they believed china is 
punishing the front for refusing to cooperate more closely with the 
khmer rouge the khmer rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people 
during its threeyear rule which began in 1975 and ended with the 
vietnamese invasion in 1978 
the commanders said the shipments ceased after a meeting in 
early december in which chinese officials requested closer 
cooperation with the khmer rouge 
senior guerrilla officers also reported that last year france 
halted its weapons supplies to sihanouks group after the covert 
program was publicized 
they said france had been supplying sophisticated famas assault 
rifles and luchaire ac rifle grenades as well as lrac 89 mm 
antitank guns which helped shift the tide of the war after 
september 
the french did not supply the other two guerrilla groups 
reporters saw at least a dozen fighters carrying famas rifles 
among the guerrillas guarding sihanouk when he crossed into 
northwestern cambodia friday to end 11 years of exile 
reporters have seen other frenchsupplied weapons in areas of 
northwestern banteay meanchey province newly seized by the 
guerrillas 
the french foreign ministry issued a denial when the thai army 
chief of staff said in april that french arms were being shipped to 
the guerrillas through thai territory the shipments were halted 
sometime later in the year the guerrilla officers said western 
diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity on friday confirmed 
their account 
france a former colonial power in indochina is among many 
noncommunist countries that extend diplomatic support to the 
resistance

british brewers and archaelogists wanting to know 
how ancient egypt made its beer plan to examine the ruins of a 
brewery read hieroglyphics and search for tiny amounts of the 
liquid in ancient pottery 
news of the threeyear project launched by a leading british 
brewery and the nations prestigious egypt exploration society 
drew headlines in london newspapers on friday 
brewers seek the pharaohs secret said one explorers 
seek the recipe for tutankhamens beer boasted another 
the independent called it one of the first largescale research 
projects to be undertaken jointly by archaeologists and a 
commercial british company 
when the researchers have figured out what went into brewing 
beer in ancient egypt the brewery will try to reproduce it at its 
laboratory in the scottish capital of edinburgh 
but jim merrington corporate affairs director for scottish and 
newcastle breweries plc said he wasnt sure if the fine ale of the 
pharoahs would be offered to tipplers in british pubs 
it is highly improbable it will appear on the bar but it is 
not beyond the realms of possibility he told a news conference 
thursday in edinburgh 
he said the project will be based largely on archaeological 
excavations at tellel amarna one of egypts ancient capitals 
located 190 miles south of cairo 
archaeologists from the society led by field director barry 
kemp of cambridge university are investigating a royal brewery 
there attached to a temple built by queen nefertiti 
she was the leading wife of king tutankhamens father the 
pharaoh akhnaton whose name also was spelled akhenaten or ikhnaton 
tutankhamen reigned from 1333 to 1323 bc his tomb was 
discovered in the valley of the kings at luxor in 1922 his solid 
gold coffin and other fabulous treasures found inside captured the 
imagination of the world 
merrington said nefertitis temple each side of which measures 
750 feet had its own brewery and bakery for making beer and bread 
for religious festivals both processes employ yeast 
but no one knows what the beer tasted like 
ancient texts and wall paintings suggest there were several 
different beers ranging from thick gruelly ales to those of a 
finer texture 
wall paintings from tutankhamens day depict courtiers vomiting 
after getting drunk on beer another wall painting shows nefertiti 
pouring her beer through a strainer to remove lumps of gruel 
merrington said the archaeologists hope to find minute traces of 
the beer if theyre successful he said scientists working for 
scottish and newcastle would use a chemical process to test those 
samples to try to determine the ancient brews taste and 
consistency 
apart from what the archaeologists give us we hope to examine 
beer residues left in pots which are now in museums in europe 
america and egypt merrington said we will use 20th century 
technology which can identify flavors to come up with a recipe 
then we will try to brew it 
researchers on the project also will examine ancient egyptian 
hieroglyphics tomb models and written material for clues to making 
the beer 
the pyramids were built on a diet of bread and beer with 
bakeries and breweries operating together kemp said the 
ancient egyptians baked a kind of bread first then used it as a 
mash from which to brew the beer

thricedelayed space shuttle atlantis and its secret military cargo 
atlantis commander john o creighton whose sore throat and head 
congestion were a factor in earlier postponements is well and 
ready to fly doctors said friday and the foul weather that has 
hung over kennedy space center since thursday faded 
early today nasa workers moved atlantis service structure 
away a few hours later according to sources the countdown toward 
launch resumed at 940 am est 
the countdown and precise launch time are secret until the final 
nine minutes but nasa said liftoff will be between midnight and 4 
am sunday sources said the most likely time is around 1 am est 
forecasters said there is a 70 percent chance of favorable 
weather for launch a slight increase in predicted winds lowered 
the probability from 80 percent forecast friday 
we do expect it to get better as we go into the day said 
air force capt ken warren we think the winds will die down 
atlantis flight path after launch is expected to be roughly 
parallel to the eastern us coastline passing within a few 
hundred miles of some points if the skies are clear residents 
from northern florida to new jersey may be able to see the rocket 
fire of the spacebound shuttle 
creightons illness and uncertain weather forced nasa to cancel 
launch attempts on thursday and friday the astronaut recovered in 
time for a launch early today but nasa officials did not even 
start the countdown after rain dense leaden clouds and 
thunderstorms moved into the area on friday 
sources who spoke on condition they not to be named said 
atlantis will deploy a 500 million spy satellite called afp731 
during a fourday mission the satellite is capable of taking 
highresolution reconnaissance photos and listening in on 
electronic communications all over the world 
sources said the satellite is to be placed into a high 
inclination orbit that will cover more of the earth than satellites 
previously launched by the shuttle this orbital path will carry it 
over most of the soviet union including areas far to the north 
the soviet union has similar satellites over the united states

in central seoul riot police dressed in combat gear fired 
barrages of tear gas and charged about 1000 students holding a 
rally students hurled hundreds of firebombs as well as bricks and 
chunks of cement pried from sidewalks 
down with roh taewoo students shouted lets crush the 
antidemocratic merger that tramples the peoples sovereignty 
the students were demanding dissolution of a new governing party 
comprising rohs party and two opposition groups they say the 
merger is undemocratic and a ploy by the roh government to stifle 
moves toward democracy 
it was the most widespread show of antigovernment sentiment so 
far this year and also included protests in the cities of kwangju 
chonju anyang suwon and mokpo support for the radical students 
had dwindled in recent months but the surprise party merger in 
january prompted renewed demonstrations 
roh speaking on nationwide television saturday discounted the 
possibility the new governing party would bring about a return to 
authoritarian government 
the path toward democratization should never be blocked and 
authoritarian rule is a thing of the past said roh who took 
office after months of antigovernment demonstrations in 1987 
forced his predecessor chun doohwan to allow the first free 
nationwide elections in 16 years 
at least four opposition legislators members of the party for 
peace and democracy joined about 50 dissidents at seouls anglican 
church after riot police blocked a rally at a downtown cathedral a 
party spokesman said the lawmakers went on their own initiative and 
party policy opposed violence or joining dissidents to fight the 
merger 
at another protest in seoul 1000 radical students ran through 
the narrow streets of a fashionable downtown shopping area shouting 
antigovernment slogans police kicked and punched students and at 
least 50 were arrested there were no reports of serious injuries 
at chosun university in kwangju south of seoul 600 students 
fought riot police with firebombs and rocks when they were 
prevented from marching from the campus news reports said 
there were no details of antigovernment protests in the four 
other cities although some rallies were violent said the 
chosunilbo and hankook ilbo newspapers 
roh was sworn into office feb 25 1988 for a single fiveyear 
term he was the handpicked successor to chun who had taken power 
eight years earlier with military backing 
one of the radicals major demands has been the withdrawal of 
43000 american troops stationed in south korea the radicals say 
the us presence is an impediment to reunification of south korea 
with communist north korea 
under roh south koreas staunchly anticommunist government has 
sought relations with communist and east bloc nations to broaden 
trade and establish ties which it hopes will help ease tensions 
with the north 
roh was quoted saturday as saying he expected south korea to 
establish full democratic relations with the soviet union and china 
i am convinced south korea will be able to establish formal 
tiesit will be a matter of time the newspaper joongang 
ilbo quoted roh as saying some reports said roh indicated full 
ties with moscow could occur before the end of the year 
roh also said he believed he would visit the communist nations 
before stepping down as president at the end of his term in 
february 1993 
south korea has already set up ambassadorial relations with 
hungary poland and yugoslavia and is expected to establish formal 
ties with bulgaria and czechoslovakia when south korean foreign 
minister choi hojoong visits in march 
south korea agreed in december to exchange limited consular 
relations with moscow 
the seoul government does not allow its citizens to travel or 
communicate with rival north korea without government approval 
which is seldom given pro communist activites are illegal in 
south korea travel to other communist nations however has been 
eased with the new diplomatic initiatives

lawmakers are taking steps to ensure that 
feeding programs for the poor dont get shortshrift treatment in 
the congressional draft of this years major farm bill 
legislation called the mickey leland memorial domestic hunger 
relief act will be introduced tuesday to improve food stamp and 
surplus commodity distribution programs to the tune of 600 million 
its a joint housesenate measure in honor of the former 
chairman of the house select comittee on hunger who was killed in 
an airplane crash last year during a visit to ethiopia 
the bill goes farther than the bush administration proposals 
but is expected to become the nutrition title of the farm bill 
without major changes 
to me nutrition programs are not just a title added on to the 
end of the farm bill said sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of 
the senate agriculture committee whose staff helped write the 
legislation to me nutrition programs are a test of the 
conscience of this nation this farm bill cannot be complete until 
the needs of the hungry are met 
the proposed legislation calls for an additional 600 million in 
spending for both food stamp and free food programs over the 
current budget year which ends sept 30 
the temporary emergency food assistance program changes would 
require the government to raise from 120 million to 190 million 
the amount it spends on of high protein food distributed free to 
the poor each year 
the legislation also would require the government to spend 32 
million on commodities to be supplied to soup kitchens throughout 
the fiveyear life of the farm bill 
the food assistance programs are used widely in rural areas 
where food stamps are difficult to get about 15000 food 
distribution centers mostly churches hand out food the government 
purchases especially for the program and surplus commodities 
already owned by the government 
a key change in the food stamp program is a provision that would 
take greater account of higher housing costs 
studies show that some low income families pay up to 70 
percent of their income in rent said ann kittlaus spokeswoman 
for food research and action center which has been lobbying for 
the improvements 
the new legislation would not set a dollar limit on how much a 
person can pay in rent and still qualify for food stamps 
a release from rep leon panetta dcalif said that kittlaus 
organization and 100 religious government health and lowincome 
advocacy groups endorsed a statement of principles that are 
embodied in this bill 
panetta who once headed the house agriculture subcommittee on 
domestic marketing and nutrition is now chairman of the house 
budget committee his interest is significant 
weve made some very good progress with hunger relief 
legislation to repeal some of the damage done in the early 1980s 
panetta said in an interview with the national journal the 
problem we now have is that some barriers still remain 
kittlaus whose organizations works nationally and has lobbied 
hard over the years to improve programs for the poor said she was 
encouraged by the bush administrations approach to these problems 
weve been in a lot more contact with the usda than we ever 
were during the reagan years she said their proposals are not 
everything we would like them to be but at least they are 
listening 
at least they are saying there is hunger in america she 
said

been reopened when two more containers of potentially lethal 
potassium cyanide were sighted

lt duane gerstenberger clearly remembers 
the night he and other state police set up michigans first 
sobriety check lane nearly four years ago the only people who 
complained were the two drivers arrested out of 126 who were 
checked he says 
but this week the practice is the subject of arguments before 
the us supreme court with civil libertarians urging the court to 
rule its unconstitutional and 30 states weighing in on the side of 
michigan officials 
officers set up roadblocks for an hour and 20 minutes on may 17 
and 18 1986 in front of a vlasic pickle factory about two miles 
north of interstate 75 near saginaw 
it would have lasted longer but it rained so hard we had to 
take it down for our officers safety gerstenberger said friday 
the drivers were there for 15 to 30 seconds we didnt get any 
negative feedback on it except from the two we arrested said 
gerstenberger who supervised the operation 
authorities dropped charges against one of the suspects and the 
others case is awaiting the outcome of a constitutional challenge 
brought by state lawmakers the us supreme court on tuesday is 
expected to consider whether sobriety check lanes violate the 
fourth amendment protection against unreasonable searches 
davids party store located on the fourlane highway near where 
the 11man police contingent set up saw its business dry up that 
night word spread to the der eisenbahn bar about a halfmile 
south of the check lane it cleared out by 1230 am and most 
drivers took routes to avoid the check lane 
i had some people come in and tell me they were going to buy 
some beer but decided against it once they saw the police cars 
party store owner tim david told the saginaw news at the time 
people are always skittish on this road because this is the 
main route for the state police david said friday their post 
is less than a mile from here 
nearly four years later the checkpoint isnt a daily topic of 
conversation but were wondering whats going to happen 
store clerk connie lavery said 
so is howard simon executive director of the michigan chapter 
of the america civil liberties union the aclu orchestrated the 
challenge in which six legislators won a court order forbidding the 
state police from setting up more sobriety checks after the first 
try 
this is the first case in the history of this country in which 
the supreme court will be considering whether police can stop 
people for no reason whatsoever to enforce a criminal law he 
said 
michigan attorney general frank kelley said briefs supporting 
sobriety check lanes have been filed by 30 states and the us 
department of justice alcohol was blamed in 793 traffic deaths in 
michigan and more than 18500 nationally in 1988 the latest year 
for which statistics are available 
driving a car is not a constitutional right it is a privilege 
granted by the state kelley said all we were doing is taking 
30 seconds of a motorists time 
gov james blanchard in 1986 directed state police to set up the 
check lanes the state appealed a february 1989 michigan supreme 
court decision that let stand lower court rulings declaring the 
check lanes unconstitutional 
antidrunkendriving groups such as mothers against drunk 
driving defend the check lanes as relatively unintrusive 
what we consider an intrusion is when a driver is stopped 
abruptly on the highway and your body is mutilated in an accident 
caused by a drunk driver said bethany goodman executive 
director of the michigan chapter of madd 
kelley defends the procedure as a brief inconvenience that 
constitutes less of a search than the security measures at airports 
or border entry points 
former state rep rick sitz now of tampa fla was one of the 
original opponents 
its just like in the movie casablanca where claude rains 
turns to the gendarmes and says the colonel has been shot round 
up the usual suspects he said thats what they want to do 
with check lanes groundless searches or dragnets have no place in 
our society 
the michigan sheriffs association has another argument against 
the check lanes arguing that they are a waste of police resources 
give me 14 officers and ill put them on the road with their 
only assignment being to find and arrest drunk drivers and if they 
dont bring in a minimum of one arrest each they arent worth 
their salt deputy director dale e davis said

the frown turns to a smile at the sound of 
giggling sam jones whirls around pointing at the line of 
frolicking schoolgirls 
it wasnt too long ago the people here were too scared to let 
the kids out jones says as the girls skip by but his smile 
turned to a scowl as he returned to his account of the past saying 
there were drugs and guns mostly fear the parents were afraid 
to walk around never mind the kids 
an alliance of residents and builders is creating a reborn 
community with few signs of fear fewer of drugs and none of guns 
today the signs are of hope and promise 
so far glenardens turnaround is a story of success one 
residents and owners say is a model for subsidized housing 
developments nationwide where drugs and violence have added terror 
to the troubles of lowincome families 
glenarden is owned by an investors group arranged by associated 
financial corp of california and managed by an afc affiliate the 
companies and a web of affiliates late last month were suspended 
from any new department of housing and urban development business 
hud says it is investigating allegations the companies misused 
government and tenant funds at several developments in oklahoma and 
the district of columbia 
hud secretary jack kemp says afc is one of a handful of 
companies that make lucrative fees by syndicating lowincome 
housing tax credits but put too little money back into the troubled 
developments they take over 
at glenarden however the owners are setting aside a portion of 
their credits to pay for bathroom vanities and other fixtures that 
hud said were too extravagant to be paid for with the developments 
government loan 
residents of glenarden say they are pleased about a better 
living environment no matter how it happened 
i used to be embarrassed to live here says frances 
howerton a 20year glenarden resident but i feel great pride 
now we are becoming a true community 
less than two years ago glenarden was known not as a community 
but as the drugstore with cars often lined up to buy drugs 
from dealers stationed outside the drab rows of apartment 
buildings inside those buildings were rodentinfested units with 
leaky pipes and sagging ceilings families too poor to move too 
scared to mingle outside 
at its worst we had unending drug infestation says 
howerton most of the drug dealers who were here didnt actually 
live on the property it was just the best place to do business 
the new facades on the renovated buildings are the most obvious 
sign of change inside new cabinets and appliances line the 
kitchens the bathrooms have been remodeled and fresh paint covers 
the walls a model unit is used to give residents tips on cleaning 
and energy efficiency 
howerton says the most important change is in the attitude of 
residents who are steadily being moved into renovated units and 
the owners whose rental license had been suspended before they 
agreed to the ambitious 15 million renovation plan 
families are no longer afraid to speak up to have a voice in 
what is going on around here she says howerton president of 
glenardens residents association speaks highly now of the owners 
and managers she once scorned 
there is a deep trust now she says we have learned to 
trust one another 
the owners however have had little time or reason to celebrate 
their success 
during tours in december and again last week afc officials 
talked of taking the lessons learned here to troubled projects 
elsewhere they talk now about getting out of the lowincome 
housing business while fighting huds sanctions 
afc which denies any wrongdoing said last week it is 
negotiating to turn over control of most of the 45000 subidized 
apartment units it controls at 350 properties in 35 states 
the dispute likely to trigger a lengthy court battle pits hud 
against one of the nations largest landlords of subsidized 
housing 1988 republican presidential hopeful kemp against afc 
president a bruce rozet who has raised hundreds of thousands of 
dollars for democrats 
afc is assuring the residents of glenarden the fight with hud 
wont make vain the battle being won here 
we wont leave glenarden until the work is finished says 
afc vice president richard tell who has spent most of the past 
year at glenarden supervising the renovations weve come too far 
here to walk away now 
a reminder of the stakes lies just down a hill from the first 
row of renovated units 
the windows of this apartment are covered with plywood the thin 
beams of sunlight sneaking past the edges providing the only inside 
light because the fixtures have been ripped from the walls and what 
is left of the ceiling broken glass and beer cans line the floor 
was a crack house jones says quietly 
outside bulldozers are turning the giant complex into a handful 
of villages a plan not only designed to give residents a greater 
sense of community but also to take away from dealers the easy 
escape routes police say stymied past attempts to curb the drug 
trade 
roads that once connected now are being blocked off leaving 
just one access route for each village the gate will be guarded by 
a tenant 
the work is scheduled for completion in the fall then howerton 
says it will be up to the tenants 
after what weve been through here you have to learn a new 
way of thinking she says its a matter of changing attitudes 
about the way you live but we have a voice now because of that 
youre going to take pride in what you do and youre going to take 
care of it

defense secretary dick cheney 
predicted saturday that talks on the future of us bases in the 
philippines will be very difficult given a wave of 
antiamericanism there 
i sense that the political dynamics and the current 
environment are such that its difficult to find elected leaders 
who are willing to stand up publicly and embrace the continuation 
of the current arrangement cheney told reporters while en route 
to washington at the end of a twoweek visit to asian capitals 
cheney was burned in effigy and hundreds of protestors demanded 
the closure of the six us military sites during the secretarys 
talks in manila 
the wrangle over the bases whose leases are due to expire in 
1991 marred an otherwise successful trip for cheney his first to 
the region as defense secretary 
president corazon aquino upset over negative coverage of her 
coupplagued government in the us media and congress decision to 
cut 96 million in support for the bases refused to see cheyney 
during his visit 
yet he went out of his way to praise mrs aquino and her 
committment to democracy and cheyney reported that she responded 
albeit not in person 
i received a nice response from her through a third party 
cheney said he declined to identify the individual who carried the 
message 
in talks with philippine defense minister fidel ramos cheney 
said the united states would abandon the bases if it finds that 
keeping them is too expensive or that americans are unwelcome 
after cheney left manila mrs aquino said she was ready to 
discuss in security and good faith differences over 
compensation for the bases 
cheney asked whether he was willing to name a date for such 
talks would say only that washington is eager to have the talks 
begin as soon as possible they are expected to begin in april 
but no date for opening the exploratory talks has been set 
the defense secretary said he believes the majority of filipinos 
want the americans to stay but there appeared to be little 
sympathy among the philippine political leadership for the economic 
difficulties in washington that have led to aid cutbacks and tough 
talk about compensation for the bases 
the historic ties are strong cheney said 
but he added i also came away from my trip with the view 
that the negotiations are going to be very difficult 
cheney said his effort to reassure asian allies of the us 
commitment to the pacific was well received even though hed 
informed them that some 10000 to 13000 us troops probably will 
be withdrawn from the region by 1993 
his hosts in south korea and japan were willing to listen to his 
requests that they kick in additional support for those troops he 
said 
cheney said the exact details of the drawdown have yet to be 
worked out adding the numbers could change by small amounts 
once we get it all together i want to review carefully those 
plans myself 
he said he couldnt predict a dollar amount in savings saying 
that would depend on which units are chosen to be withdrawn 
clearly well be able to save some money he said 
asked about future cuts he said hed reassess the situation at 
the end of the threeyear period for possible adjustment levels 
but that will depend on developments theres no way you can 
predict what things are going to look like three years from 
now he said 
i think it was generally well received cheney said of his 
trip 
he said his message of fewer troops and less money to pay for 
them may have come as a shock to some 
change is always a little disconcerting in the region but i 
felt that especially the japanese and koreans were understanding 
and sympathetic and prepared to support the overall initiative 
he said 
the secretary was asked about prospects for opening ussoviet 
talks on troop levels in the region given the opening hes taken 
with the unilateral force reduction 
he didnt rule it out but pointed to the difficulties 
surrounding such negotiations in the pacific and asia cheyney 
said we dont have the kind of formal framework you have in 
europe such as the nato and warsaw pact alliances that allow for 
negotiations on conventional troop reductions

in the final days of prosecution 
testimony against joseph hazelwood the state has revived the 
question of whether the exxon valdez skipper was drunk when his 
tanker went aground 
the defense calls the issue a red herring but its 
resolution by a jury will help determine whether hazelwood is 
convicted or acquitted on an array of charges 
after three weeks of testimony and 39 witnesses there is 
extensive but inconclusive evidence about alcohol 
did hazelwood spend a day ashore drinking before his ship 
sailed some crew members say he had a few drinks at a bar in the 
port city of valdez the wife of a coast guard investigator insists 
she saw the skipper drinking earlier than anyone else and several 
witnesses said they smelled alcohol on his breath 
but the skipper denies being drunk and not a single witness has 
said he appeared intoxicated 
repeatedly defense attorneys have asked witnesses was the 
captain impaired did he slur his words did he stagger 
the answer has been no 
in a lastminute effort to bolster his position assistant 
district attorney brent cole proposed calling in speech experts 
from canada and indiana who claim they can tell by listening to 
speech patterns whether a person is intoxicated 
the experts analyzed tapes of hazelwoods conversations with the 
coast guard for the national transportation safety board and 
concluded he sounded intoxicated 
defense attorney michael chalos called the speech analysis 
voodoo stuff and argued it has never been admitted as evidence 
in any us court 
i understand its less reliable than a lie detector test 
which is inadmissible said chalos 
superior court judge karl johnstone who chastised cole for 
proposing this tactic so late hasnt decided whether to allow the 
testimony 
hazelwood 43 a seaman from huntington ny has a history of 
drunken driving convictions and underwent 28 days of voluntary 
rehabilitation in 1985 but jurors cant be told about that because 
a defendants prior record cant be used against him 
hazelwood is charged with seconddegree criminal mischief which 
is a felony and three misdemeanors operating a vessel while 
intoxicated reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil 
he could draw 7 years in prison and 61000 in fines if convicted 
on all counts 
recklessness is a key element in proving the charges and 
drunkenness would support a finding that hazelwood was reckless in 
leaving the control of the tanker to a third mate and helmsman 
during a dangerous passage 
the exxon valdez rammed jagged bligh reef on march 24 10 
minutes after hazelwood had left the bridge its oil tanks were 
ripped open gushing nearly 11 million gallons of alaska crude oil 
into the clear waters of prince william sound the nations largest 
oil spill ever 
allegations that the captain was drunk surfaced soon after 
this alcohol issue has been blown up out of proportion and had 
nothing to do with the grounding said thomas russo one of 
hazelwoods defense lawyers the whole hype that was put out 
about captain hazelwood being drunk hasnt panned out 
why then was the issue raised prosecutors have consistently 
declined to comment outside court but their case shows that two 
investigators who boarded the exxon valdez shortly after its 
grounding reported smelling alcohol on the skippers breath and 
called for blood alcohol tests of the crew 
hazelwoods test administered 10 hours after the grounding 
showed he had a blood alcohol level of 06 lower than the alaska 
state limit for driving but higher than coast guard limits for 
operating a commercial vessel 
others who were aboard reported smelling liquor on hazelwood but 
seeing none of the physical effects of drunkenness william murphy 
the marine pilot who boarded the exxon valdez to guide it through 
the tricky valdez narrows testified hazelwood was absolutely 
in command of his tanker although he detected the odor of alcohol 
on the skipper 
prosecutors played for jurors friday a tape of hazelwoods first 
postaccident interview in which he said he drank only one beer in 
valdez and one or two bottles of moussy a brew with almost no 
alcohol that was permitted aboard the tanker 
if so how could his blood have tested positive for alcohol so 
long after the accident a prosecution alcohol expert will try to 
explain and after the state rests tuesday defense experts will 
give their theories

february has been a cruel month for people who 
like their taxes simple 
it was during this month that most people began giving serious 
consideration to their tax returns they opened up the instruction 
booklet and found the system generally is just as complicated as a 
year ago 
so complicated in fact that internal revenue service 
commissioner fred t goldberg jr complained to the house ways and 
means committee that the laws and regulations are imposing an 
unacceptable burden on taxpayers and our system of tax 
administration 
if people cant understand the law goldberg said they will 
engage in shortcuts and not fully comply its that simple a 1 
percent drop in compliance costs the treasury more than 5 
billion 
in the same capitol hill hearing room two weeks later there was 
another message from dozens of special interests ranging from 
bigtime charities to lowincome soldiers to tuxedo rental shops 
pleading for the kind of special tax breaks that add complexity to 
the law 
and finally the payoff money magazine announced that 50 tax 
professionals who had been commissioned to prepare the return of a 
hypothetical family came up with 50 different tax liabilities that 
ranged from 9806 to 21115 
the magazines 130000ayear makebelieve family had some tax 
problems that the typical family would never encounter but some of 
the experts made mistakes on some basic issues such as moving 
expenses that even a lowpaid american might have to confront 
all this is happening 3 years after congress and thenpresident 
reagan agreed on a major tax overhaul whose main selling points 
were fairness and simplicity 
the new law made taxpaying simpler for as many as 6 million 
lowincome people by removing them from the tax rolls another 10 
million found things simpler because they lost some valuable 
deductions and no longer had reason to itemize 
however there was a consensus among witnesses testifying before 
congress that the new law resulted in little simplification for 
most americans as a result rep dan rostenkowski dill 
chairman of the ways and means committee has launched a new 
simplification initiative and asked the public for suggestions 
rostenkowski wont find many in congress who disagree that the 
system is overly complex as in the past however he is likely to 
hear warnings that in many cases complexity is the price paid for 
fairness 
for example repealing the deduction for charitable 
contributions would free more than 25 million people from a lot of 
recordkeeping and paperwork but it also would cost them a big 
deduction and could mean a loss of revenue for churches schools 
and organizations that help the poor 
the tax system is probably as simple as it is going to be for 
people whose incomes are almost entirely from wages interest and 
dividends whatever simplification comes about in the near future 
probably will be for the benefit of those whose returns reflect a 
lot of stock transactions partnership income and more exotic 
investments 
most of that simplification would have to come from the irs 
which writes thousands of pages of regulations each year spelling 
out exactly what the tax law means goldberg already has his own 
simplification initiative under way aiming for example to 
produce basic regulations that are as broad as possible and that do 
not attempt to cover every conceivable exception 
such an approach might mean there might never be another 
222page regulation such as the one last year whose sole purpose 
was to define the term passive activity 
the bush administration also is pushing simplification using 
the complexity argument to oppose several targeted tax breaks that 
were proposed to the ways and means committee last week however 
the administration is recommending a package of targeted tax 
increases and tax cuts that would add their own complexity 
the capitalgains tax cut that president bush wants would have 
three different levels of taxation depending on how long an asset 
was held the president also wants to create four tax incentives 
for the oil industry and recommends a new deduction for parents who 
adopt children with special needs 
rostenkowski and other democratic leaders recall that repeal of 
a capitalgains provision was a key factor that led to passage of

the first step toward repealing the overhaul and wiping out

the founder of israels security services says 
famed nazi hunter simon wiesenthal played no significant role in 
the capture of adolf eichmann 30 years ago despite wiesenthals 
claims to the contrary 
wiesenthal had no role whatsoever in either the discovery the 
identification or the capture of adolf eichmann isser harel says 
in an unpublished manuscript made available to the associated press 
harel challenges the enduring legend of wiesenthal as the dogged 
tracker who supplied key information that enabled israeli agents to 
locate the nazi fugitive in argentina 
while not an entirely new dispute harel and wiesenthal clashed 
years ago the harel manuscript was the most detailed effort yet 
to debunk wiesenthals claims 
this is a matter of jealousy wiesenthal said in a telephone 
interview from vienna 
harel said he held off disputing wiesenthal before now because 
he did not want to give satisfaction to jewhaters and nazi 
sympathizers 
but harel said he could no longer keep quiet he said that 
although he would not publish the manuscript commercially he 
wanted it preserved for historians history must express the 
truth about this case he said 
with few exceptions the 79yearold harel has avoided the 
spotlight he founded mossad the legendary israeli intelligence 
agency and masterminded the 1960 operation in which mossad agents 
kidnapped eichmann in argentina and spirited him to israel for 
trial 
eichmann ran the gestapo bureau for jewish affairs and was 
accused of responsibility for planning and ordering the deportation 
and murder of 4 million jews he was convicted by an israeli court 
and hanged in 1962 
while harel remained largely unknown the 81yearold wiesenthal 
gained world fame as a nazi hunter a reputation that began with 
accounts of his role in the eichmann case 
in books written over 30 years wiesenthal has recounted how he 
narrowly missed capturing eichmann in austria in 1949 kept track 
of his brothers and wife over the years and supplied israel with 
information about eichmanns whereabouts in argentina as far back 
as 1954 
in all my books i say it was team work i never say i alone 
was responsible for the eichmann capture wiesenthal said 
yet repeatedly in published material and most recently in a 
1989 home box office movie about his life wiesenthal is depicted 
as instrumental to the eichmann abduction 
his first book in 1961 was titled i hunted eichmann 
adolf eichmann whose spectacular capture was engineered by 
wiesenthal reads the flyleaf of wiesenthals latest book 
justice not vengeance scheduled for us release next month 
harel does not dispute that wiesenthal was among those who 
sought eichmann nor does he deny the holocaust survivors pivotal 
role in tracking nazi fugitives and keeping alive international 
awareness of the german atrocities 
but in his 270page manuscript he said all the information 
supplied by wiesenthal before and in anticipation of the operation 
was utterly worthless and sometimes even misleading and of 
negative value he repeated that assessment in a telephone 
interview from his home in suburban tel aviv 
just as its very critical to accurately depict nazi crimes 
it is very important that the effort to bring to justice nazi 
criminals be truthfully recorded said neal sher who heads the 
justice departments office of nazi war crimes 
while it is clear that many people were looking for eichmann 
after the war there can be no doubt that the most reliable and 
authoritative source on the mossad operation that captured eichmann 
is isser harel said sher who teaches a course at cornell 
university about the eichmann trial 
in the 1970s harel told his account of the capture in a book 
entitled the house on garibaldi street which is where eichmann 
lived under an assumed name wiesenthal is not mentioned in the 
book 
harels book gives generous credit to others involved in the 
affair sher said among those is fritz bauer the west german 
prosecutor whom harel identified as the source of the information 
that eventually led to eichmann 
harel said he had not known the extent to which wiesenthal took 
credit for the operation until he visited the united states last 
year on a fundraising drive for israel and repeatedly encountered 
audiences who asked about wiesenthals role 
he tried to erode israels role in the affair harel said 
wiesenthal rejected the accusation but said that when he passed 
on information to israel in 1954 about eichmann being in argentina 
no one believed me when interviewed by a mossad team in 
austria in 1959 wiesenthal said he again provided valuable 
information 
yet in a march 3 1960 summary of the interview a translated 
version of which harel made available the mossad operatives said 
we again found wiesenthal to be avoiding full and sincere 
cooperation although he is prepared from time to time to feed the 
ambassador crumbs of general information we parted from 
wiesenthal very coldly 
in his books wiesenthal tells of informing the german embassy 
in buenos aires in december 1959 of nazi fugitive josef mengeles 
last two known addresses in the argentine capital this was done as 
a test case to see whether the argentine authorities who were 
sympathetic to the thousands of nazi fugitives in their country 
would extradite the notorious death camp doctor he said 
wiesenthal viewed their refusal to hand over mengele as proof 
that they would also have refused an israeli request for eichmanns 
extradition 
but harel argues that wiesenthal had no right to undertake such 
a risky step without the approval of israel which was at the same 
time closing in on both eichmann and mengele 
wiesenthals action tipped off mengele who decamped from the 
argentine a few weeks before we reached buenos aires 
wiesenthals initiative could have warned eichmann too and 
jeopardized his capture harel added 
here wiesenthals folly borders on the criminal harel

the elections sunday in nicaragua are offering 
the united states and that deeply polarized central american 
country a unique opportunity to have a more cooperative 
relationship after long years of bitter rivalry 
but that outcome is far from certain and nicaragua could well 
continue to be a divisive issue both domestically and 
internationally if the election results are tainted by allegations 
of fraud according to officials 
for the bush administration the most desirable outcome would be 
a victory by opposition candidate violeta chamorro this would 
bring about an early exchange of ambassadors an end to the 
fiveyear us trade embargo against nicaragua and a renewal of 
us aid for the first time in a decade 
the thousands of contra rebels stationed at base camps in 
honduras presumably would lay down their arms and return to 
nicaragua in peace 
in addition if the leftist government headed by president 
daniel ortega is returned to power in an honest process the bush 
administration has committed itself to a more normal relationship 
provided certain conditions are met in the elections aftermath 
secretary of state james a baker iii said thursday his price 
for friendlier ties is a sustained period of good behavior by 
the sandinistas 
as the election approaches republicans and democrats so often 
at loggerheads over nicaragua during the 1980s find themselves 
generally in agreement on the basic elements of the situation 
if ortega wins and shows he is both committed to democratic 
values and to refraining from interfering in neighboring countries 
the administration and the congress agree that a new era in 
usnicaraguan relations is possible 
the only differences are in the pace and scope of normalization 
democrats generally seem willing to move more quickly and 
comprehensively than republicans 
but what happens if ortega declares victory in a situation in 
which his announced margin is narrow and there are widespread 
allegations of fraud 
this outcome is widely expected among state department experts 
on nicaragua although most polls in nicaragua show ortega with a 
comfortable lead officials here believe mrs chamorro has the 
votes to defeat ortega 
the concern among officials is that sandinista authorities will 
be able to rig the result in ortegas favor despite the presence of 
about 2000 foreign observers 
president bush will encounter a variety of competing pressures 
if ortega wins a disputed victory if bush decides that the 
political costs of contesting such an outcome are too high he 
could declare it a flawed but acceptable result and then proceed 
slowly toward normalization of relations 
some analysts argue that this course would benefit longrange 
us interests because the hand of hardliners in the sandinista 
government including interior minister tomas borge is weakened 
when us policies are conciliatory under this scenario ortega 
also would be more inclined to loosen his ties to his chief 
hemispheric ally cuba 
the offer of us trade ties and financial assistance according 
to this theory would give ortega an incentive not to run afoul of 
washington 
alternatively a tainted ortega victory almost certainly would 
produce conservative pressure on bush not to endorse a process in 
which there is a strong perception that the will of the nicaraguan 
people has been trampled 
former assistant secretary of state elliott abrams says he is 
concerned that if the administration blesses an election stolen by 
ortega this would only embolden the sandinistas to accelerate 
their assistance to leftist rebels in el salvador 
abrams says that during the past 2 years the sandinistas have 
dishonored every promise they have made concerning their links to 
the fmln rebels 
how many agreements have the sandinistas signed promising to 
stop arming the fmln he says 
whatever the outcome sunday there appears to be little support 
here for restarting the contra war it was two years ago this month 
that congress ended military aid to the rebels 
a 495 million program of us humanitarian aid for the contras 
is about to expire and the administration soon will open 
consultations with the congress on what to do next 
democrats generally will favor an aid program designed to 
repatriate the contras while the administration is likely to 
support a continuation of the existing program under which food 
and other aid is provided without strings

a syrian gunboat apparently looking for 
arms shipments to lebanon shelled a passenger ferry traveling from 
cyprus to lebanon on saturday killing one civilian and injuring 
18 crew members and military officials said 
the dead man was identified as a 26yearold lebanese who had 
just obtained an emigration vist to canada and was headed home to 
pick up his pregnant wife 
crew members said the attackers menaced the baroness m before 
pumping 20 shells into it as it headed for the lebanese port of 
jounieh 
the ship was flying a syrian flag and was apparently on guard 
against weapons shipments to lebanon where the christian army 
leader opposes the syrianbacked government and the presence of 
40000 syrian soldiers deployed to quell civil war fighting 
military sources on cyprus speaking on condition of anonymity 
said they also believed the boat that attacked was syrian 
greek capt george samlotakis said the gunboat accosted the 
ferry three times first at about 430 am when it was 19 miles 
west of jounieh 
they asked us who was on board and where we were going said 
egyptian mechanic mohammed mohammed almurshidi 27 he said he 
talked with them because most of the ferry crew spoke on greek or 
english while those on the gunboat spoke arabic 
samlotakis said he then turned the ferry back to cyprus and 
about 30 minutes later the gunboat approached at great speed 
i immediately prepared to stop and was in the process of doing 
so when suddenly and without any warning the gunboat opened fire 
against us said the captain 
salmotakis said 20 shells hit the ship wrecking his cabin right 
below the bridge and heavily damaging the bar and cafeteria on the 
deck below where many people had taken cover 
there was terrible confusion and panic on board there was 
smoke and dust everywhere and people screaming he said 
we ran from one side of the boat to the other as the gunboat 
circled said rima suleiman a receptionist on the boat 
the captain said at dawn two hours after the first encounter 
passengers and crew went to the top deck and waved flags and sheets 
at the warship to signal that they needed help for the wounded 
crew member danny zarour said at that point the gunboat took 
down its flag 
it stayed in the distance for awhile then approached a third 
time the captain said 
as if nothing had happened he ordered me to open the back 
gangplank so that he could examine our cargo he said 
the baroness m designed to take cars on and off the back ramp 
usually travels with an empty hull to lebanon only the passenger 
baggage is stored in the area for cars 
we told him we were a greek ship under the cyprus flag and he 
told us go back to our country and dont try to come to lebanon 
again samlotakis said 
the attack wounded 18 passengers four critically said a 
spokesman for the british royal air force bases on cyprus the 
royal air force has a major base at akrotiri on the southern coast 
of the island 
the royal air force evacuated 15 of the wounded by helicopter 
before the ferry docked at larnaca at 1 pm said the spokesman 
who declined to be identified 
the wounded most suffering cuts and burns in the legs from 
shrapnel were rushed to local hospitals for treatment 
the dead man was identified as nasr abu nasr 26 
he was hit by shrapnel all over his body said ms suleiman 
he was sitting facing the bar exactly where a shell hit 
nora kasbari spokesman for socomar agents for the ship said 
it carried 64 passengers and 52 crew members when it left larnaca 
late friday for the sevenhour trip to jounieh 120 miles east 
the boat is one of two that travels regularly between lebanon 
and cyprus it is a main escape route for christians fleeing their 
embattled enclave in lebanon where christian army forces are 
battling for control over the lebanese forces christian militia 
the port of jounieh is controlled by the lebanese forces which 
also has a share in the ferry operations 
the ferry service and other maritime traffic came under fire 
repeatedly during six months of fighting in lebanon in 1989 between 
the christian army leader gen michel aoun and the syrian army 
and its moslem militia allies 
syrian troops were deployed in lebanon in 1976 under a 
peacekeeping mandate to quell civil war fighting aoun said they 
violated the mandate by siding with the moslems in the war and 
vowed to drive them out

president bush has invited not only the 
nations governors to dinner sunday but the entire population of 
tuna texas to boot 
and they are all coming in the persons of jaston williams and 
joe sears the comic actors and quickchange artists who put tuna 
on the theatrical map back in 1982 
they have since performed greater tuna their twoman 
twodozen character takeoff on smalltown texas life nearly 2000 
times from austin to offbroadway to edinburgh and this past 
december they unveiled a seasonal sequel a tuna christmas 
that broke records at the kennedy center 
it was there that two transplanted texans now residing at 1600 
pennsylvania avenue george and barbara bush decided the madcap 
spectacle of two guys jumping in and out of dresses overalls wigs 
and characters would be just the thing to cap an evening with the 
governors 
the state dinner for governors in town for their winter 
meeting is a traditional event pianist michael feinstein 
performed last year 
but who would have thought a republican president from yale 
would get a kick out of two avowedly liberal entertainers who first 
conceived their tuna satire as a thumbinyoureye riposte to 
the moral majority 
you just never know said williams but we knew better 
than to say no 
the bushes came backstage after taking in the show jan 6 on 
their 45th wedding anniversary 
the president asked if we were from texas he leaned to mrs 
bush and said we must have these boys over to the white house 
williams recalled in an interview 
they were still in their dressing gowns during that encounter 
when they showed up for tea with mrs bush 10 days later they were 
wearing their sunday finest 
shes a very clever and funny lady she had seen us in our 
texas attire backstage said williams at the white house she 
eyed them and remarked well you two clean up real nice then 
she invited them back for the state dinner 
sears and williams were also invited to dine with the governors 
but the duo is passing up the supper 
we said we would just prefer to be backstage and warming up 
said williams it would be a little hard to eat before the 
performance 
the two will perform four scenes and six characters during the 
25minute skit from greater tuna they will reprise a sermon by 
a biblebelting preacher and a funeral parlor viewing they will 
replay the holiday party from a christmas tuna they will close 
the evening with a skit especially written for the occasion a 
telephone call to the white house from a tastee kreme waitress 
joe will be bringing aunt pearl burras reverend spike and 
bertha bumiller said williams and i will be bringing vera 
carp helen bedd and arles struvie 
both actors now live in the austin area williams was born in el 
paso sears in oklahoma after years as struggling actors 
performing traditional fare their takeoff on life in the third 
smallest town in texas has brought both fame and fortune 
wiliams said his father a grizzled crusty old farmer told 
me son if youd ever known what was going to happen you should 
have put that dress on 25 years ago 
when you can get your father to say that i guess we have 
crossed the last hurdle said williams 
or the next to last arles struvie bertha bumiller amp co may 
cross the last hurdle in the east room sunday night

the senate ethics committee is using a 
standard tool of prosecutors combining major and minor charges 
to establish a potential pattern of misconduct by sen dave 
durenberger in promoting his books sources say 
the committee on thursday found substantial credible 
evidence that the minnesota republican violated senate rules and 
federal law mostly in promoting two books he authored the panel 
voted to hold a triallike proceeding 
durenberger has launched a public relations effort that 
emphasizes the less serious charges his spokeswoman carrie 
collins characterizes four of five potential rules violations as 
minor bookkeeping or financial reporting errors 
but sources familiar with the case speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the combined allegations suggest a pattern of 
behavior that violated senate rules to enable durenberger to sell 
books 
and one allegation that ms collins calls minor could escalate 
into a major problem sources said if evidence shows a willful 
attempt to file false financial disclosure reports 
former rep george hansen ridaho was convicted in 1984 of 
four felony counts for submitting false financial disclosure 
statements to congress he served nearly a year in prison 
the sources said the committee is mainly concerned in the case 
with rulebreaking not criminality but the panel is obligated to 
refer any criminal evidence to the justice department 
in the possible violation that everyone agrees is major the 
committee said durenberger may have exceeded limits on nonsenate 
income when he accepted payments for speeches during 198586 
durenberger contends the money should not have counted toward 
the limit because he made the appearances as an author promoting 
books not in his official capacity as a senator 
also during 198586 the committee said durenberger failed to 
publicly disclose the travel reimbursements he received from the 
organizations that hosted the book promotion speeches 
last july four months after the committee began its 
investigation the senator amended his annual senate disclosure 
forms to include the information 
this is the potentially troublesome allegation sources said 
former house speaker jim wright resigned from congress last year 
after he was charged with 69 instances of rulebreaking including 
evading outside income limits through bulk sales of his book 
other allegations cited by the senate committee against 
durenberger involve possible conversion of a 5000 campaign 
contribution to personal use by transferring the check to 
durenbergers publisher using senate space for commercial purposes 
and acceptance of limousine service in the boston area in 198586 
the limousine was provided by host organizations so durenberger 
could visit his marriage counselor in concord mass 
the sources said the allegations are similar to a prosecutor 
bringing felony and misdemeanor charges against a criminal 
defendant the lesser charges often would not have been brought by 
themselves but become an important part of the case 
durenbergers public relations blitz meanwhile expanded 
friday the senator sent a tape to all minnesota radio and 
television stations pronouncing himself pleased that the committee 
will now get some sunshine on the facts 
durenberger chiefofstaff bert mckasy also released a 
questionandanswer sheet to news organizations emphasizing that 
two potential allegations were dropped and the remaining case has 
been considerably narrowed 
tom horner the senators former chiefofstaff and now a public 
relations executive in bloomington minn was hired recently by 
durenberger to aid in the counterattack 
horner was quoted in minneapolis as saying the senator has a 
concern that the full story is not getting out

former sen harrison a williams jr still 
owes the federal government much of his 1981 fine for bribery and 
conspiracy and a tennessee congressman says he should use his 
federal pension to pay off the debt 
current law allows the us government to recover debts from 
federal employees by making deductions from their salaries and 
retirement pay the justice department says 
however it has never been tried with a member of congress 
according to assistant attorney general carol t crawford 
the law is there apparently but theyve just never applied 
it said jim edwards a spokesman for freshman rep john j 
duncan rtenn 
i dont believe in kicking a man when he is down duncan 
said of williams dnj however the fact is that senator 
williams owes the government money while he is being paid a 
government retirement check this situation should be corrected 
duncan said only 232423 of williams 50000 fine has been 
collected so far 
williams reached earlier this month in new jersey where he has 
been helping at a drug treatment program said attorney john d 
arsenault was handling payment of the fine 
its worked out through my lawyer williams said i know 
jack has worked out a program and im going to be abiding with it 
its all taken care of 
phone calls to arsenaults office in new jersey were not 
returned 
williams was released from prison in january 1986 after serving 
two years of concurrent twoyear and threeyear sentences for 
bribery conflict of interest and conspiracy in the abscam sting 
in that fbi operation undercover agents posing as middlemen for 
arab sheiks met with williams he agreed to accept a hidden 
interest in a virginia titanium mine in return for helping to find 
military contracts for the venture according to evidence at trial 
williams said in the telephone interview that the abscam matter 
was not yet behind him and he had filed freedom of information 
requests to obtain material that could clear his name 
duncan began pursuing the matter of unpaid federal debts at the 
request of knoxville tenn mayor victor ashe who had seen 
published reports last september that williams had drawn more than 
320000 from a federal pension while owing most of his 50000 
abscam fine edwards said 
after a series of letters ms crawford wrote duncan on jan 25 
1990 that the us attorneys office in new jersey was exploring 
the possibility of pension deductions 
based on your and mayor ashes inquiry the us attorneys 
office is now investigating the applicability of these provisions 
to senator williams case and will utilize them to the extent 
possible to recover his federal fine she said 
spokesmen for the justice department in washington and the us 
attorneys office in newark declined to say whether they had 
proceeded with deductions 
we are actively pursuing the funds that we feel the department 
is entitled to said doug tillett of the justice departments 
criminal division 
the matter is in litigation said dick lavinthal a 
spokesman for the us attorney in new jersey when there is an 
outstanding debt to the government we pursue it 
ms crawford informed duncan that other routes had been pursued 
in collecting williams debt such as seizing his federal income 
tax refunds however she said williams owns no real property and 
his bedminster nj home was purchased in his wifes name 
preventing the government from using it to satisfy the debt

the helicopter appears as a pinlight on the 
northern horizon the brightest star in a dark blue sky 
coming closer it shoots a wide beam of light over the rooftop 
at jackson memorial hospital and settles down with a shuddering 
blast of tropical air two men inside have been shot twice each 
with 9mm bullets and one is dying 
dr jeff vaughan waiting on the landing pad turns to a nurse 
youre going to see blood now sister he says 
but spilled blood is routine at jackson memorials trauma 
center already this evening the trauma crew has treated a woman 
shot by her boyfriend a man dumped 30 feet off a scaffold a 
10yearold bicyclist hit by a car and a prison inmate stabbed with 
a homemade knife 
that roster accounts for every serious injury suffered in the 
miami metropolitan area in the preceding six hours if youre badly 
hurt in dade county these days the only place to go is jackson 
memorial 
that distinction puts jackson a publicly financed teaching 
hospital at the forefront of a dismal national trend it is one of 
a shrinking number of big city hospitals offering special care for 
trauma the medical name given to lifethreatening injuries 
in los angeles chicago philadelphia and elsewhere private 
hospitals have been shutting down trauma units most of which 
opened in the mid1980s the specialtys boom years 
the resulting squeeze threatens not only quality of health care 
but also the financial stability of the hospitals left carrying the 
load 
gunfights car crashes the occasional industrial accident 
these are the lifeblood of trauma care centers the american 
college of surgeons estimates that 250 to 350 trauma centers 
operate around the country ranging from such giants as new yorks 
bellevue hospital and miamis jackson memorial to the nt enloe 
hospital in chico calif and easton hospital in easton pa 
trauma units are usually affiliated with but distinct from 
ordinary emergency rooms ers handle broken legs concussions 
poisonings the lesser varieties of mayhem trauma units take over 
in more serious cases of multiple injuries when lives are on the 
line 
trauma centers are staffed by surgeons and major trauma 
hospitals keep full staffs of specialists on duty around the clock 
if you need a neurosurgeon at 3 am jackson memorial will have 
one 
in rural and suburban areas trauma is almost always the result 
of auto accidents and the drivers are usually insured in these 
areas trauma centers pay their way even make profits 
but in inner cities patients increasingly are members of what 
doctors caustically refer to as the knife and gun club club 
members have a couple of things in common they are almost always 
involved in drugs they are almost never insured 
at jackson memorial which handles 6000 trauma cases a year 
about onethird of the patients are admitted for penetrating 
trauma knife or bullet wounds about onethird of the patients 
are uninsured 
these are expensive injuries and blunt trauma injuries 
suffered in car crashes can be even costlier its not unusual for 
traumacare bills to mount into the tens or even hundreds of 
thousands of dollars 
even with the paying patient trauma is going to cost more 
than the average treatment more than what insurance will probably 
pay said jeanne eckes a registered nurse who coordinates 
jacksons trauma service 
jackson estimates the trauma unit will lose at least 12 
million this next fiscal year in addition to direct losses the 
hospital loses money when trauma patients bump regular patients 
out of operating rooms and intensive care beds that happens nearly 
every day 
of four patients admitted to jacksons trauma center so far this 
evening three have been sent to the operating room or intensive 
care the lone exception is the luckless prison inmate whos been 
treated for his stab wounds and sent back to jail 
it is already a grueling evening filled with splitsecond 
lifeordeath decisions even the janitor is busy mopping up blood 
from the trauma room floor 
on a break in the action vaughan and another doctor alan 
rosenberg wolf down dinner in the cafeteria they are there when 
air rescue calls about 10 pm 
two men with gunshot wounds had shown up at a hospital eight 
miles away they couldnt be treated there the hospital doesnt 
handle trauma they are being flown to jackson 
on the elevator to the roof rosenberg and vaughan turn goofy 
with excitement they stretch out on the two gurneys and joke and 
slap five they dont get serious until the helicopter is down and 
then with the blades still blurring overhead they get serious in 
a hurry 
vaughan is first into the elevator with the more seriously 
wounded man before the doors shut he is frantically at work 
hes not moving any air man he says his voice tight with 
tension he shoves a tube down the mans nose and squeezes a 
bulbous green bag a hole in the patients chest gurgles with blood 
when the elevator reaches the ground floor vaughan runs with 
the gurney to the trauma room his patient is slipping away 
patients like this are flown to jackson every day the hospital 
tallies more than 1000 helicopter landings a year in what some 
doctors say is a legacy of the vietnam war the airborne rescue 
some people say the entire modern system of trauma care grew out 
of the militarys medical experience in vietnam others say it 
evolved in large urban hospitals in the 1960s 
trauma care grew rapidly after research in the late 1970s proved 
trauma centers routinely saved lives that would be lost with 
ordinary emergency care 
by the early to mid1980s trauma had become hot business in 
search of prestige and profits hospitals jumped at the opportunity 
to treat trauma victims despite the expense of maintaining a 
24hour staff of surgical specialists 
some cities established trauma networks to ensure patients were 
sent to the closest trauma hospital miamis network established 
in 1985 ultimately consisted of six private hospitals and the 
public jackson memorial 
b boyd benjamin the blunttalking gravelvoiced chairman of 
the board of the dade county public health trust recalls what 
happened then 
it was wonderful he said big committees met everything 
was fine and the first thing that happened i guess was some poor 
sonofabitch got run over and didnt have a penny and he ends up at 
one of these forprofit hospitals and they want to ask wheres 
your insurance i dont have any insurance they found out 
very quickly that this was going to be a loser 
in the space of six months in 1987 all six private hospitals 
dropped out of the network leaving jackson the only metropolitan 
area hospital willing to accept adult trauma patients miami 
childrens hospital accepts injured children 
a similar winnowing process has taken place in other big cities 
as hospitals discover their expected profits are elusive 
they see it as fiscally irresponsible said dr gerald o 
strauch director of the trauma department at the american college 
of surgeons in chicago we all know that hospitals have become 
big business and theyre managed like a big business

in los angeles county a regional trauma network with 23 
hospitals has shrunk to 13 chicago had 10 adult trauma hospitals 
two years ago the loss of another hospital this month will reduce 
the number to six 
houston is down to just one level i trauma center capable of 
handling the most serious cases one of philadelphias major trauma 
centers temple university hospital recently announced it was 
leaving a regional trauma system 
the hospitals that remain are increasingly overwhelmed their 
trauma centers resembling nothing so much as military mash units in 
the heat of battle indeed the military sends its physicians to 
inner city trauma centers to prepare them for combat 
the consolidation of trauma care raises some daunting questions 
what happens to the patient whos in a serious auto accident and 
has to be taken 25 miles to a hospital instead of five worse what 
happens when a plane crashes 
its gotten to the point where no matter who you are if 
youre injured in a city your chances of getting to a trauma 
center that has everything it needs are getting slimmer said dr 
jeff augenstein one of the attending surgeons in charge at jackson 
jacksons administrators believe theyve found a solution 
having accepted their hospitals role as the citys only 
traumacare center they intend to capitalize on it they are now 
trying to raise 25 million for what benjamin the public health 
trusts board chairman calls a state of the art world class 
selfcontained freestanding shocktrauma center 
the idea is to get trauma patients out of the main hospital 
leaving more room there for regular paying patients our 
projections show that we will at least break even benjamin said 
hospital officials hope the new center will become a magnet for 
research dollars and talented staff in the meantime doctors at 
jackson insist they can handle anything that comes their way 
it is 1014 pm when jeff vaughan wheels the gurney into the 
trauma room half a dozen people jump to action one slips an 
oxygen mask over the patients face another takes blood vaughan 
examines the body it is young and strong and has bullet holes in 
the chest and shoulder two police officers stand to the side 
watching 
wheres xray vaughan hollers cmon hector lets get a 
quick film 
at 1018 vaughan inserts a tube nearly the width of a garden 
hose into the left side of the mans chest it begins pumping 
hemorrhaging blood out of the chest cavity and into intravenous 
tubes for transfusion vaughans rubber gloves and gown are covered 
with blood red dots shine on his eyeglass lenses 
whats his pressure someone shouts 
very very low vaughan yells back hes got serious 
problems in his chest 
he goes to the other side and inserts another tube weve got 
blood on this side too guys and lots of it 
within minutes the crisis ebbs the patients systolic blood 
pressure about 50 when he entered the trauma room is up to 110 
his pulse is strong he breathes with the aid of the oxygen mask 
the gurney is pushed out the door and up to the operating room 
hes a long way from being ok but hes got a chance 
vaughan says 
bloody footprints mark the path down the hall 
it has been a remarkable display of grace under pressure but it 
isnt enough this time the patient dies 10 minutes into surgery 
his buddy survives and not for the first time medical records 
show hes been treated at jackson before for gunshot wounds six 
times 
hey man you gonna get some frequent flier miles if you keep 
coming in here vaughan tells him 
police say the two men claimed to have been attacked on the 
street for no reason the cops tone suggests disbelief 
vaughan drifts into an employee lounge for a dr pepper and a 
smoke he is about 18 hours into a 24hour shift and it is 
beginning to show he speaks bitterly about the strains of the job 
and patients who would just as soon kill us as look at us 
its a war zone he says and its like this in every 
major city

democrats will be the leading contenders in next months national 
elections 
the 76yearold brandt received a standing ovation after his 
election he is also honorary chairman of west germanys social 
democrats who form that countrys biggest opposition party 
brandt was mayor of west berlin when the berlin wall was built 
in 1961 as chancellor of west germany from 1969 to 1974 he worked 
for improved relations between east and west his efforts won him 
the nobel peace prize in 1971 and made him a hero to many east 
germans 
brandt was one of the first west german officials to step into 
east berlin after the berlin wall was opened nov 9 at the height 
of the prodemocracy movement that made next months elections 
possible 
social democrats in both countries have been urging east germans 
to stay and work for changes at home already this year more than 
100000 east germans have resettled in west germany 
its worthwhile to stay here its worthwhile to start

mitterrand and other leaders as world attention focuses on the 
fastmoving developments toward reunifying east germany and west 
germany 
i view this as a very important discussion he said 
theres a lot of keen interest not just in europe but around the 
world on these discussions were going to have 
light snow flurries fell as bush clad in a leather flight 
jacket and wool slacks and his wife barbara welcomed kohl and 
his wife hannelore to camp david the retreat in marylands 
catoctin mountains

wunderbar kohl replied before getting into a golf cart in 
which bush drove him from a helicopter landing zone to the camp 
david living quarters 
their talks are expected to focus on the rapid movement toward 
reunification and when negotiations should be held on bringing the 
two germanys back together 
kohls visit comes as east germany nears its critical march 18 
elections one of his cabinet ministers predicted in a news report 
friday that the election will leave the east too divided to agree 
on a government and east germany instead will opt for immediate 
union with west germany 
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble expressed this view to 
secretary of state james a baker iii and national security adviser 
brent scowcroft the newspaper report said 
sometime after the march 18 election talks on unification are 
to begin between east and west germany and the four major victories 
allies of world war ii the united states france the soviet 
union and great britain 
baker and scowcroft are joining bush and kohl today for the camp 
david meeting bush and kohl both support reunification and agree a 
united germany should be a member of nato

part of germany but became part of poland after world war ii 
kohl has taken no position but west german conservatives are 
pressing to regain the territory 
bush has said his administration recognizes existing borders 
kohl comes to the united states on the heels of the feb 13 
agreement in ottawa calling for the two germanies to develop a 
unification plan and meet with the four other powers to approve it 
and work out larger security issues 
under political pressure at home kohl also is looking to the 
possibility that reunification will bring his party greater support

with his seizure of an armory to house 
overflow prisoners a mildmannered county lawman with a masters 
degree in social work was catapulted into a confrontation with 
state officials 
hampden county sheriff michael j ashe had been best known for 
innovative jail and community programs ranging from one of the 
first day reporting centers in the country to a jail garden teaming 
inmates and senior citizens 
then on feb 16 he seized the national guard armory an action 
applauded by guards judges citizens and even prisoners hes 
become a hero on radio talk shows but the plainspoken sheriff 
who never misses a wake or a wedding and once sneaked off to a 
mcdonalds to fill up after a fancy state dinner at the white 
house says hes never fancied himself as a rebel 
ive always been a team player he said for the past 15 
years ive been here weve worked very very hard in a professional 
way to try to manage the severe overcrowding 
weve looked in closets in the garage and under the stairs 
and weve had prisoners in all those places but there comes a 
point where you run out of a little magic and you just have to 
go into the ring 
the sheriff admitted the timing of his move on the friday 
afternoon before the presidents day holiday was calculated by the 
time stunned state officials responded he had 15 prisoners 
installed in the armory and public opinion solidly in his corner 
on friday state officials told a judge they would not challenge 
his occupation for at least two weeks while looking for other 
housing 
saturday the number of prisoners stood at 17 
for more than a decade ashes knack of mixing toughness and 
progressive social programs has kept a lid on his centuryold 
county jail 
he believes inhumanity and coddling arrive at the same 
point said richard mccarthy jail spokesman rather than let 
prisoners lie in their cells all day mccarthy said whether it 
is one of the vocational programs or working in the kitchen the 
men have to answer the bell every morning just like john q on the 
street and just like they will have to do when they get out 
one of the first things ashe did after taking over the job in 
1975 was to turn the sheriffs quarters at the jail into a 60bed 
prerelease center where inmates within six months of release get 
extensive vocational substance abuse and other counseling 
in 1986 he added the day reporting center where inmates with 
four months left to serve can be released on a electronic 
monitoring program that allows them to live at home as long as they 
report in several times a day 
more than 1500 of the men that passed through his cells have 
earned high school equivalency diplomas he also started one of the 
few prison industry programs to operate in a county jail last year 
the office furnituremaking operation returned 200000 in profits 
to the county mccarthy said 
ashe reached the end of his patience with jail overcrowding 
after more than a year of turning loose hundreds of prisoners to 
meet a 500inmate limit established by a federal judge previously 
ashe had jammed 726 men into space supposed to house 279 
it came down to a moral and ethical thing ashe maintained 
saying he could no longer live with the fear of having one of the 
prisoners he released kill or maim the system had collapsed and 
someone had to do something 
born and raised in the irish neighborhoods of springfield ashe 
married his high school sweetheart before running for sheriff he 
worked as a social worker and he and his wife barbara were the 
first house parents in a program started by the roman catholic 
church to help homeless children they have five sons and one 
daughter

the furious savage lived up to his name slapping douglas who 
had climbed into the ring for the end of the match after calling

steve powers says hes relieved to be 
going back to work monday for pittston coal group 327 days after 
1695 united mine workers struck the company in a contract dispute 
but hes also perplexed 
both sides ended up getting basically what they said they really 
wanted before the strike began union members have the job security 
and health and retirement benefits they sought and the company has 
its operational flexibility 
now powers said the miners are trying to figure out why it took 
so long to end the fight which cost the company and the union 
millions of dollars and caused bitter divisions in coalfield 
communities 
its hard for me to understand the construction worker from 
clintwood said after studying the contract and hearing umw 
officials compare the terms with the contract that expired in 
february 1988 top scale went to 1752 an hour for selected 
positions up 120 an hour 
perry moore said he was equally confused pointing out the 
flexible scheduling that pittston won i cant figure out why we 
were out 11 months just for that he said 
pittstons umw workers in virginia west virginia and kentucky 
worked 14 months without a contract before umw president richard 
trumka called a strike april 5 pittston had refused to agree to 
the national contract the umw negotiated with the bituminous coal 
operators association an industry group 
miners claimed throughout the strike that the motivation behind 
pittstons original contract proposal was to eventually set up a 
nonunion operation 
last monday the coal miners ratified a settlement that 
negotiators reached new years eve the final ratification vote was 
delayed while the two sides settled legal issues related to the 
strike 
many miners link the progress on contract talks after months of 
stalemate with the intervention of labor secretary elizabeth dole 
and her appointment of former labor secretary william usery as a 
federal mediator 
usery said part of his success in bringing the two sides 
together was his ability to persuade negotiators to set emotions 
aside and listen to their counterparts 
pittston president michael odom agreed bill usery brought a 
new light to the process odom told reporters after the 
ratification was announced 
umw vice president cecil roberts said usery was able to get each 
side to identify what provisions they truly needed in the contract 
we all learned some lessons from this roberts said its 
better to talk than to fight 
asked to give his advice to future negotiators in labor 
disputes odom said put yourselves in the other sides shoes 
and be innovative 
odom bristled when asked if pittston came out a loser 
i feel like we were a winner he said we were not trying 
to eliminate the union we wanted flexibility 
the contract allows pittston to operate for seven rather than 
five days a week umw members traditionally dont work sunday 
and put some miners on a weekly schedule of four 10hour days 
odom said during the bargaining that he couldnt understand why 
the union was so opposed to the flextime which he said will 
allow pittston to become more efficient increase its coal sales 
and hire more workers 
it was a good compromise settlement for both sides 
the contract also includes a new profit sharing plan that gives 
workers incentive to increase productivity 
mine worker james gibbs said he hopes the contract will mark the 
beginning of better labor relations with pittston 
hopefully thats what the profit sharing is in there for 
last summer the pittston strike prompted thousands of workers 
at other mines across the southeast and midwest to stage wildcat 
sympathy walkouts 
violence also erupted sporadically during the strike 
replacement workers and supervisory personnel were often pelted 
with rocks when they drove to work and verbally abused when they 
went to town 
now the replacement workers are gone but the managers and 
supervisors will be there when the miners return 
there will be some tensions we will have to deal with odom 
said 
but powers said i know ill be glad to get back to work i 
want life to get back to normal

italian counterpart on saturday expressed concern that a common 
currency for east and west germany could increase world interest 
rates and slow economic growth italian officials said 
brady met guido carli for two hours at the italian treasury on 
the second day of his fiveday european tour the talks focused on 
international economic cooperation and the creation of a european

west germany has proposed making the west german mark the currency 
for east germany as well to help that countrys economic survival

rates must be in line with the general interest and that an 
increase in interest rates shouldnt spill over from germany to

german unification proceed in parallel with an accelerated 
unification of europe

constructive

irancontra prosecutors used written answers 
former president reagan gave more than two years ago to neutralize 
part of his videotaped testimony last week that could have helped 
john poindexter 
in his deposition for poindexters trial reagan initially 
seemed to suggest that it might have been all right for aides to 
destroy documents in november 1986 in order to protect the lives of 
us hostages or iranian contacts 
the former president had to back away from that suggestion 
however when confronted with his earlier statements in the 
irancontra affair 
a portion of the indictment against poindexter the former 
reagan national security adviser who faces trial march 5 on five 
felony charges accuses him of conspiring with white house aide 
oliver north to destroy classified documents on the iran initiative 
in november 1986 
did you authorize any member of the national security 
council to destroy or alter any records relating to the 
iran or contra affair reagan was asked by irancontra prosecutor 
dan webb 
webb clearly expected the former president to say no but 
reagan didnt answer directly instead he emphasized the 
possibility that there were such papers that would violate the 
secrecy that was protecting individuals lives 
renewing complaints about news leaks on capitol hill reagan 
said congress was not in many instances capable of the kind of 
security that we required 
in response webb pulled out a written answer given in the fall 
of 1987 in which reagan said that at no time did i authorize or 
approve the destruction or alteration of documents 
was that a truthful statement webb asked 
yes acknowledged reagan abruptly ending that portion of 
his testimony 
reagans written responses plus exhibits combined in a 
telephonebooksize document were given to a federal grand jury 
in answer to questions posed by irancontra prosecutors 
only a few of those answers were read into the record at 
reagans deposition in los angeles and the rest remain secret 
reagan was videotaped feb 1617 for poindexters trial and a 
transcript of his answers was released thursday 
the former president repeatedly gave general answers that 
appeared to help poindexter causing problems for webb the 
prosecutor told us district court judge harold greene in a bench 
conference midway through the deposition 
the president has indicated basically there is an atmosphere 
that he approved and authorized much of what john poindexter did 
and i want to try to bring out as best i can through very specific 
limited questions that john poindexter and oliver north were 
engaged in a lot of underlying contrarelated and iranrelated 
activities that he did not know about did not approve of did not 
authorize 
webb was only partially successful 
of norths activities on behalf of the contras reagan said 
i know that he was very active and that was certainly with my 
approval i was convinced that they were all being done within 
the law 
asked whether he had given poindexter authority to send false 
answers to congress reagan told webb no and i dont think any 
false statements were made 
reagan also testified that the iran initiative wasnt a deal to 
trade arms for hostages an assertion that contradicts statements 
he made in an address to the nation three years ago 
a few months ago i told the american people i did not trade 
arms for hostages reagan said in march 1987 my heart and my 
best intentions still tell me thats true but the facts and the 
evidence tell me it is not 
the tower board which reagan appointed concluded that the iran 
initiative deteriorated into trading arms for hostages 
in his los angeles deposition however reagan reverted to the 
statements he made in november 1986 denying the armshostages link 
the little weekly newspaper in beirut printed an erroneous 
story that we were doing business directly with khomeini and 
trading arms for hostages the former president said in his 
videotaped testimony the publication the magazine ashshiraa was 
the first to reveal the initiative 
reagan also testified that the administration wasnt sending 
munitions to the government of iran but webb drew reagans 
attention to a presidential finding he signed in 1985 which 
specifically stated that was the case 
poindexter tore up the politically embarrassing finding in 
november 1986 as lawyers from the justice department prepared to 
launch an inquiry to piece together what really happened in the 
iran arms sales 
reagan who is 79 mischaracterized the iran initiative 
compressing into several months events that took nearly a year and 
a half to play out reagan mentioned one arms shipment to iran 
earlier investigations have established that there were six 
he also contradicted the conclusions of the tower board which 
found that israeli officials working with an iranian manucher 
ghorbanifar originated the idea for arms sales to iran 
reagan testified that a group of iranian citizens traveled to 
israel and that a delegation from the national security council met 
with these citizens

hollywoods past and retired adm william crowe addressed the 
militarys future as fellow alumni honored the two famed princeton 
university men saturday 
the alumni association gave stewart its woodrow wilson award for 
undergraduate alumni distinguished in public service the james 
madison medal the graduate student equivalent was bestowed on 
crowe the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
stewart 81 an indiana pa native came to the ivy league 
campus more than 60 years ago with an accordian and hopes for an 
engineering degree he charmed an audience of 850 with 
selfdeprecating humor and strong opinions about the movie industry 
today 
he remembered his poor mathematics ability that dashed his 
freshman hopes of being an engineer saying he switched to 
architecture on the advice of several people including my math 
teacher to stay away from mathematics 
summer stock theater after his senior year led to broadway 
which led to an mgm contract he has appeared in 80 movies 
the twotime oscar winner made it clear he prefers the hollywood 
of his early days in the business over todays hollywood 
i feel very strongly looking back that the big studio system 
is the only real way to make pictures said stewart 
you didnt sit at home waiting for a script you liked you 
were there every day frankly i think if things were like that 
today wed be getting much better movies 
the studio moguls of the day stewart said loved motion 
pictures they didnt need censors they knew what was right for 
the public they hated sequels you know they make one today and 
you get six more 
he told an anecdote about a man who approached him on a movie 
set and told him 
yeah yeah i saw you in a picture you were in this 
room there was a girl there i dont know who the girl was 
you sort of went toward the door and as the guy went to the girl 
i forget what he said but he said something to you you turned and 
looked at him and ill never forget that look 
stewart told his audience i knew exactly the picture i knew 
exactly who was in it i knew exactly that turn and i knew his 
reaction to the turn was the reaction i hoped i would get 
crowe who recently retired from the military to teach 
geopolitics at the university of oklahoma received a doctorate 
from princeton in 1965 
he cautioned against the united states too quickly reducing its 
military in response to the democracy movement and new governments 
in eastern europe and decreased ussoviet hostilities 
he predicted turmoil until the power is sorted out 
we do not know as yet what the final replacement regimes will 
look like he said i suggest it will be a tough and trying 
time if not a dangerous one

bucharest romania the internal security operations run for 
decades with ruthless efficiency by nicolae ceausescus securitate 
will be revamped into an organization resembling the fbi the 
defense minister said saturday 
in addition the government plans to maintain the tunnels that 
securitate troops used during the december revolution to move 
freely while battles raged above ground against the army defense 
minister victor a stanculescu said 
the underground labyrinth has become a symbol of the repressive 
paranoid control maintained by ceausescu during his 24year tenure 
that ended with his toppling dec 22 and execution three days later 
the narrow passages reportedly connect major government 
buildings in bucharest and lead to communications bunkers or to 
underground storage depots of food weapons and ammunition 
stanculescu said the tunnels will be maintained in case they are 
needed in wartime 
stanculescu said securitate officers who did not commit 
atrocities would be given jobs in the defense ministrys new 
internal security agency which he described as similar in 
character to the fbi 
he said the securitate which had been part of the interior 
ministry was neutralized but investigations of its former 
members were continuing and the process will not be over in a 
week or two 
he did not elaborate on the process of transforming securitate 
whose repressive secret police methods had been unmatched in europe 
since the stalinist 1950s into a force resembling the fbi a 
branch of the us justice department charged with investigating 
such federal crimes as espionage bank robbery kidnapping and 
fraud 
through the securitate the communist government controlled 
nearly every aspect of romanian life it widely recruited 
informers discouraged contact with foreigners and even demanded 
that typewriters be registered 
the scarcity of information about the restructuring of 
securitate has led to widespread fears that the dreaded force is 
still in action despite repeated government denials 
last week the romanian defense ministry said more than 3500 
securitate agents had been retired the force had about 15000 
officers and thousands of civilian informers according to 
officials of the interim government 
the ministry has said some agents were arrested but it has not 
given a number and only a handful have been convicted 
stanculescu a lieutenant general also told reporters he had 
agreed to work with officers who demanded a purge in the army of 
elements associated with ceausescu 
we established together a plan and a schedule and a system of 
resolving these problems through teams he said declining to 
elaborate 
dozens of officers who played a leading role in the december 
revolution that ousted ceasuescu and ended more than four decades 
of communist rule held a week of demonstrations earlier this month 
that prompted the removal of the previous defense minister 
the protests posed the first major challenge to the interim 
government ruling romania until free elections in may stanculescu 
on friday met with representatives of the military units 
in another development state radio reported that 35 people were 
convicted of breaking into government headquarters during a 
demonstration last week of them 23 received prison sentences of 
three to six months and six were fined between 140 to 350 
six others were under age 18 and will be sent to reform school

police say they found no evidence 
to support a childabuse case against a daycare center owner who 
kept nude pictures of some of the childen placed in his care 
in the four weeks since john shavers arrest on child 
pornography charges counselors and investigators interviewed 
former employees and 20 children from his rainbow learning center 
police said friday 
what we have is not even close to substantiating a criminal 
charge said police capt bruce smith all we have are comments 
from some children that might be interpreted as inappropriate 
touching by mr shaver 
he did not elaborate on what children told the counselors 
on thursday prosecutors backed away from a report that three of 
the children had gonorrhea of the throat the state attorneys 
office said the three originally tested positive for gonorrhea but 
had come up negative on a second test tests of shaver found no 
trace of the disease 
shaver was charged with 29 counts of possessing published 
pornographic material depicting children police acting on a tip 
from a photo lab also found nude snapshots of childen in his home 
but he does not face any charges in relation to those photos the 
children in the pictures including 20 identified by parents as 
children who attended the day care center were not depicted in 
sexual situations 
the police investigation vindicates my client said shavers 
attorney j david bogenshutz 
shaver who opened rainbow learning center in 1985 had his 
daycare license revoked he previously had been forced to close a 
daycare center in hawaii following accusations that he improperly 
touched children there but he was never charged in that case

you can lead a gorilla to grass but can you make 
him sit that is the question dallas zoo officials are trying to 
resolve 
the zoos four gorillas are scheduled to be moved to a new 
outdoor enclosure in april zoo director warren iliff says that may 
not set well with a few of the large beasts who are now living 
behind bars in an indoor facility 
gorillas are conservative iliff said they will need time 
to adapt to the change 
iliff said a large male named om bom is particularly leery of 
change 
he may not even be willing to walk on the grass iliff said 
zoo staff members are trying to help the gorillas get used to 
sitting on grass by bringing grass hay and the like into their 
cages so they will be willing to make the move when the new wilds 
of africa primate habitat is completed 
earlier zoo officials attempted to ensure the new gorilla 
habitat will be escapeproof by bringing in mountain climbers to 
detect unforeseen escape routes

sparks fly while reggie kester hammers a 
length of redhot iron just out of the forge and gradually the 
metal takes the shape of a horseshoe 
kester works in much the same way as craftsmen have for hundreds 
of years using forge anvil and hammer his rough hands speak of 
the 30odd years he has spent in the trade 
but this isnt the village smithy kester and his wife 
marcella run the oklahoma state horseshoeing school where they 
teach the craft of the farrier not blacksmithing 
people hoping to enter what can be a lucrative trade come to the 
school from around the world 
i know guys that are making 150000 shoeing horses kester 
says but he admits most make between 20000 and 40000 a year 
theyve have had students from germany sweden australia 
canada ireland israel and switzerland the sixweek course costs 
2450 and is offered six times a year 
kester credits trade advertising and wordofmouth for the 
schools wide appeal all kinds sign up for the kesters courses 
most of the people we have are people who have experience with 
horses kester says but he adds we have people come through 
here who know nothing about horses except what they look like 
kester says that after his course theyll all be able to shoe a 
horse and make a horseshoe from scratch 
sometimes you just cant buy what you need kester says 
so you make it 
he says he learned the trade of a farrier as he teaches it in 
school 
im a journeyman certified horseshoer he said ive had 
a lot of experience and ive been in the teaching business for 15 
16 years 
i went to school for it in 66 i thought i knew something 
until i went to school and met people who did 
kester says theres a lot to being a farrier and it takes 
instruction and practice he says an unskilled person who shoes a 
horse runs the risk of crippling the animal 
his students dont spend all their time at the anvil hes got a 
textbook a thick volume called the principles of horseshoeing 
ii which contains information about anatomy metallurgy and 
history 
kester says there are many types of horseshoes for different 
kinds of animals there are lightweight aluminum shoes for race 
horses large heavy shoes for work animals and even plastic shoes 
for injured horses 
most horseshoes today are still metal and are nailed to a 
horses hoof but synthetic and plastic shoes that are glued to the 
hoof are beginning to take over 
i think in 10 or 20 years the standard horseshoe weve known 
for hundreds of yearsll be obsolete kester says 
as long as there are horses there will be a need for people to 
shoe them but kester says the farriers business requires 
individuals to go out and find clients 
you dont go get a job just out of school he says you go 
get a clientele its an entrepreneurial deal 
clients vary racetracks are specialized and many require union 
certification he says and working on show horses requires a high 
level of skill horses with injured hoofs need a special kind of 
care 
in some ways kester says hes an equine podiatrist but hes 
not a blacksmith 
i call myself a horseshoer and thats what i am

a man infected with the aids virus stole a 
videocassette recorder so he could return to prison and receive 
free daily doses of an expensive medicine that may prolong his life 
i want to live thats why im back said the man housed in 
an aids isolation cellblock at limestone correctional facility 
the american civil liberties union which represents the man 
has not disclosed his name other prisoners call the 35yearold 
man batman 
he is one of 140 prisoners at limestone who have tested positive 
for exposure to the human immunodeficiency virus and can get the 
drug azt at state expense 
caring for inmates with aids or hiv infections is estimated to 
cost 20000 a month said jay stuman executive vice president of 
correctional health care inc which provides medical services to 
the state prison system 
don williamson director of the state health departments 
disease control and rehabilitation services estimated 7 million a 
year is needed to provide azt to alabamians infected with the aids 
virus but lacking health insurance 
azt was the first drug approved by the federal government to 
lessen the devastating effects of aids on the bodys immune system 
the cost of the drug to individuals had varied as prices and dosage 
recommendations both have been cut but it can exceed 5000 a year 
three years ago while imprisoned for burglary and theft batman 
was tested with 12000 other state inmates and found to be infected 
with hiv 
seven months after his release in april he pleaded guilty to 
stealing the vcr 
police officer william mccormick of anniston said batman had 
enough experience with petty crimes to have stolen the vcr without 
getting caught so it was obvious he was trying to get back in 
prison 
a federal judge last month upheld the states right to segregate 
its inmates with the aids virus in a special unit at limestone the 
aclu representing the segregated inmates is appealing the 
decision

the soviet foreign ministrys policymaking body 
saturday ruled out nato membership for a unified germany saying 
that would tip the balance of european power 
the statement from the ministrys collegium was issued as west 
german chancellor helmut kohl met with president bush in the united 
states to discuss the future of germany 
both men favor nato membership for a reunited germany at 
present west germany is a member of the north atlantic treaty 
organization and east germany belongs to the sovietled warsaw 
pact 
the foreign ministry collegium in its statement carried by the 
official tass news agency rejected the argument that membership of 
a united germany in the western military alliance would satisfy 
soviet security concerns because it would place germany under 
some kind of external control 
membership in nato for a reunified germany would lead to an 
impermissible violation of the militarystrategic balance the 
collegium said soviet officials have previously said a reunified 
germany should not belong to nato 
the soviet union on this account has its own conceptions 
said the collegium which held a meeting on the german question 
saturday and these conceptions of course dont include at all 
the proposals that foresee the membership of a united germany in 
nato 
in remarks on germanys future printed wednesday by the 
communist party daily pravda soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
said any disruption of the existing militarystrategic balance is 
unacceptable 
east germany is moscows most important military ally and home 
to about twothirds of its 575000 troops deployed in eastern 
europe

the slain foreign minister was buried 
saturday on his family farm in western kenya and his widow 
appealed for calm as hundreds of police and protesting students 
faced one another during the ceremony 
if you love him as you say you do i beg you with tears in my 
eyes and as his widow to let us give him a peaceful sendoff 
said cristobel ouko 
robert oukos funeral friday touched off major protests in 
nairobi and kisumu where the body was taken for public display 
after a memorial service it was the worst violence in kenya since 
a 1982 coup attempt as students demonstrated to demand an 
explanation of oukos murder last week 
saturdays funeral ended without major incident 
mrs ouko addressed mourners shortly before president daniel 
arap moi spoke none of the long line of speakers at the burial was 
interrupted by the students 
between 500 and 600 students from four colleges arrived at the 
farm aboard eight buses shortly before dawn for the next six 
hours they paraded up and down oukos driveway chanting we want 
justice no coverup who killed bob moi should 
resign 
police halted the parading students at noon when the president 
ministers diplomats and local politicians began arriving for the 
burial service 
at the gravesite a few yards down a sloping yard from oukos 
hilltop home moi was surrounded by some 200 police their rifles 
pointing out toward the crowd 
some students managed to get close to the grave and continued 
muttering their chants moi occasionally glanced at them but showed 
no reaction 
in his speech moi again promised the government would conduct a 
thorough investigation into the death of ouko whose charred body 
was found in the brush near his home on feb 16 he had been shot 
once in the head 
i want the truth about the murder moi said 
ouko 58 was the fourth leading political figure to die 
violently since kenya gained independence in 1963 the government 
of former president jomo kenyatta was accused of covering up the 
three other murders 
ouko also was the highestranking politician from the luo tribe 
one of four major ethnic groups that vie for power in kenyas 
singleparty government and engage in rivalries that go back 
centuries the others are the kikuyu the luya and the kalengen 
university students in nairobi began demonstrating early in the 
week demanding an impartial investigation of oukos death 
the government has called in three scotland yard detectives and 
a british pathologist to assist in the investigation

the ruling sandinista front will 
remain the largest political party in nicaragua even in the 
unlikely event president daniel ortega loses sundays election but 
there still may be room for minor parties to wield some power in 
the national assembly 
after the sandinistas the social christians are expected to be 
the secondlargest single party in the new national assembly 
the united national opposition which is mounting the strongest 
challenge to the sandinistas behind presidential candidate violeta 
barrios de chamorro is a fractious coalition of 14 parties that 
may not survive defeat or even victory 
voters will choose 90 deputies on sunday and losing 
presidential candidates get additional seats if their vote total 
reaches about 1 percent 
the formula for calculating the exact vote total needed to 
qualify for a seat is complicated but will end up at about 15000 
votes which all eight minor opposition candidates may get that 
would result in a 99member legislature 
the 11 uno parties running candidates for assembly seats will 
act individually once it is no longer in their interest to be 
hedged in by coalition decisions 
none of the 11 is likely to have more than a few seats and the 
social christians hope to be second with seven or eight seats they 
may also pick up support from one of the uno parties the peoples 
social christian party 
the sandinistas would be a cohesive bloc becasue of strong party 
discipline but if they lack a majority the social christians would 
become crucial players 
a twothirds majority is needed for constitutional changes of 
any kind 
on the municipal level and in the two regional councils for the 
atlantic coast the only certain thing is that the sandinistas will 
no longer monopolize power 
it is almost certain that yatama the native indian 
organization will dominate the atlantic coast regions an area 
different from the pacific coast in language ethnic background and 
customs 
the indians and englishspeaking blacks of the atlanic side are 
so fiercely independent that the sandinista government was forced 
to accede to their demands for autonomy 
some councils in the 144 cities and towns nationwide will most 
certainly be in opposition hands especially in the central 
mountains where the usbacked contras and uno are strong 
although they have local government responsibilities their 
power may be limited by the centralized nature of nicaraguas 
government the councils will have to depend on managua for money 
because they collect no local taxes

leaders of a fournation arab council 
saturday urged arab unity to cope with changes sweeping the world 
and iraqs president urged arabs to shift their wealth from the 
united states to eastern europe 
just as israel uses interest groups to apply pressure on the 
american administration there are hundreds of billions of dollars 
invested by arabs in the united states and the west which could be 
used for this purpose iraqi president saddam hussein said 
in fact this investment could be converted to the soviet 
union and eastern europe and i believe it is a profitable 
investment probably more profitable than in the west 
saddams statement came at the opening of the first anniversary 
summit of the arab cooperation council an alliance of iraq egypt 
jordan and north yemen 
leaders of the nations held private talks on friday and closed 
their summit saturday night by signing 11 agreements on economic 
and administrative cooperation 
jordanian foreign minister marwan kassem said they also called 
for withdrawal of all nonlebanese troops from lebanese soil a 
reference to syrian and israeli forces in the strifetorn country 
iraq is a bitter foe of iran and syria the latter has some 
40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab league mandate while 
israel and the militias it funds occupy southern lebanon as a 
selfdeclared security zone 
kassem spoke at a news conference following the summits closing 
session 
the chief political adviser to egyptian president hosni mubarak 
osama elbaz told the associated press that the four nations had 
also agreed to contact world leaders in a campaign to halt jewish 
settlement in arab territories captured by israel in 1967 
kassem however said that would happen only after a meeting of 
arab league foreign ministers in midmarch 
arabs have expressed alarm that tens of thousands of soviet 
jewish immigrants to israel could settle in the occupied 
territories 
elbaz said such settlement would be a threat to the security 
of the arab nation and to the peace process itself 
in other resolutions the leaders supported the palestinian 
uprising in the occupied territories backed iraq in its disputes 
with iran called for peace in lebanon and praised the release from 
prison of south african black leader nelson mandela 
in their speeches the leaders urged arabs to overcome 
differences to cope with the democratic changes that are redrawing 
the map of europe 
the world will not deal with us positively unless this unity 
is achieved jordans king hussein said in his closing statement 
the king said earlier saturday that a new world order is 
emerging based on economic and political blocs rather than on 
hegemony and the arms race 
he said arabs can either be part of the historic developments 
and employ them to enhance their existence stability and growth 
or be on the periphery and so become an easy prey that is 
mercilessly leeched and discarded 
while saddam called for arabs to use their financial muscle to 
influence the united states none of the acc countries has much of 
it egypt and jordan are both coping with economic crises 
iraq has the worlds secondlargest known reserves of oil but 
it is financially drained by its long war with iran saudi arabia 
kuwait and other gulf states hold the bulk of arab investment 
wealth 
saddam said arabs must deal with the united states but 
america has to respect arabs and their rights and not interfere in 
their internal problems

the west german government has assured the 
bush administration that a reunified germany will renounce any 
claim to polish land a newspaper said saturday 
the report came as west german chancellor helmut kohl met with 
president bush at camp david md for weekend talks mainly 
involving unification 
poland wants a clear renunciation from the bonn government that 
a reunified germany would not seek to take control of german 
territory that was given to poland at the end of world war ii 
the west german newspaper bild am sonntag said saturday that 
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has told us secretary of 
state james a baker iii a reunified germany would respect the 
current border with poland the assurances were reportedly given 
during a visit to washington earlier in the week 
bild am sonntag said such a declaration could be issued as soon 
as the east german government votes to join with west germany and 
schaeuble predicted that step would come shortly after east 
germanys free elections set for march 18 
there will be an absolute and unmistakable clarification 
regarding the polish border bild am sonntag quoted schaeuble as 
telling the americans 
bild am sonntag said its information came from a confidential 
telex that schaeuble had sent back to the foreign ministry in bonn 
the newspaper which has good contacts within the government in 
bonn said its report would appear in sundays editions a copy was 
distributed in advance to other news media 
it was not clear whether the latest reported west german 
assurance would satisfy poland and other jittery nations of the 
sovietled warsaw pact kohl has refused to categorically renounce 
any claim to the polish territory 
however on the eve of kohls us trip foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher of west germany gave an interview urging a 
clear west german recognition of polands western border 
german conservatives whose votes kohl hopes to gain in december 
elections have pushed claims for about a third of modernday 
poland that was sliced off germany by the victorious allies after 
world war ii 
in another news report the west german news magazine der 
spiegel reported that former communist party leader erich honecker 
placed money paid by west germany for the release of political 
prisoners into a private bank account 
according to der spiegel the amount was 48 million last year 
alone 
the prisoners were mostly people convicted of trying to escape 
from the country under the former hardline regime 
prosecutors have already said they intend to indict the 
77yearold honecker next month for treason and corruption he was 
ousted following prodemocracy demonstrations in october

the seabrook nuclear power plant is on the 
verge of obtaining an operating license after years of 
demonstrations regulatory delays and financial problems that 
forced its lead owner into bankruptcy 
the nuclear regulatory commission said last week that it would 
rule thursday on a license for the 64 billion plant which became 
a symbol for opponents of nuclear power in the 1970s 
protests began before groundbreaking in august 1976 when 18 
people were arrested at the site subsequent protests have resulted 
in about 3200 arrests including 1400 in a may 1977 
demonstration the last major demonstration was in october when 
475 people were arrested 
if the nrc gives its approval as expected spokesman john 
kopeck said there would be about a week of paperwork before the 
commission issued the actual license if promised court appeals 
dont succeed seabrook would go through a threemonth buildup to 
fullpower operation 
the main sticking point to licensing has been federally required 
evacuation plans for communities including six over the border in 
northeastern massachusetts within 10 miles of the plant 
critics argue that the area surrounding the plant two miles 
from popular hampton beach and 40 miles north of boston is too 
densely populated to be evacuated safely in an emergency 
the 10mile area has a population of 148000 which swells to a 
summertime peak of 247000 according to estimates by seabrook 
officials 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis refused to submit evacuation 
plans to the nrc so new hampshire yankee the operating company 
set up by the dozen utilities that own seabrook submitted its own 
plans for massachusetts 
new hampshire submitted its evacuation plans long ago when 
staunch seabrook supporter john sununu now white house chief of 
staff was governor 
critics cite neargridlock on coastal roads on hot summer 
weekends as proof the plans wouldnt work 
i think theyre a fraud said robert backus lawyer for the 
seacoast antipollution league i live 40 miles away and i dont 
feel safe 
this process is a sham whenever the nrc runs into a rule it 
cant meet it changes the rule said backus who has opposed the 
project for years although he was initially neutral 
as an example he objected to the nrcs changing its rules to 
reduce standards for utilitydrafted evacuation plans after 
massachusetts refused to submit its own plans seabrook spokesman 
rob williams called that 1987 change a clarification of nrc policy 
for reviewing such plans 
last fall the nrc further irked plant opponents by abruptly 
taking control of critical seabrook licensing issues after two 
lowerlevel nrc panels issued conflicting findings about the 
evacuation plans 
that decision prompted a congressional investigation of nrc 
procedures that is still in progress 
quite apart from the merits of seabrook for the nrc to muzzle 
an appeals board is a brutal and naked power grab the height of 
arrogance sen gordon humphrey rnh said at the time 
plant officials claim the regulatory process has been stacked 
against them 
seabrook has been through a more stringent regulatory process 
than any nuclear plant ever licensed seabrooks top executive 
edward brown said in november the people who claim that this is 
a biased process ignore the fact that it has taken 17 years from 
the date of the initial license application for seabrook to get to 
this point 
the plant idle since its completion in 1986 except for 
lowpower testing last year became an increasing financial burden 
on its main owner public service co of new hampshire barred by 
state law from charging customers for seabrook expenses before it 
generated electricity public service entered bankruptcy 
reorganization in january 1988 
a 23 billion takeover of public service by connecticutbased 
northeast utilities parent company of connecticut light amp power 
another seabrook owner should be completed by july 
public service first announced plans to build a nuclear plant in 
1968 but delayed it for financial reasons in 1972 the company 
announced that it planned to build two 1150megawatt reactors the 
first planned for commercial operation in 1979 the second in 1981 
the estimated cost 973 million 
owners scrapped the second reactor in the mid80s completing 
the first in july 1986 at a cost of 43 billion since then 
financing and maintenance and other costs have boosted the cost by 
50 million a month bringing the total by thursday to 65 billion 
in the meantime protests against seabrook continue the 
clamshell alliance a group of plant opponents announced it would 
hold 24hour vigils beginning tuesday at the statehouse in concord 
and at seabrook

nicaraguas future is in the hands of 
the losers in sundays general election as well as the winners 
former president jimmy carter said saturday 
he also said the united states should move immediately to 
repair tattered relations with nicaragua if the vote is free and 
fair 
at least 3000 international observers are monitoring the 
election according to election officials but carters verdict 
will be crucial in part because of the impact he had when he 
denounced fraud in the panamanian election last year and in part 
because his group includes a dozen us senators and 
representatives 
carter said the sandinista government which has been in power 
since the 1979 revolution realizes the importance of holding an 
election that he can endorse and has adopted virtually all of his 
recommendations to ensure a clean vote 
it would indeed be a hollow victory if they got the most votes 
and then i went before the world media and said in my opinion this 
vote was false he said 
sen christopher dodd dconn who has been a key player in 
usnicaragua policymaking criticized the bush administration for 
setting conditions for normalizing relations after the vote such 
as requiring a period of good behavior 
i think youve got to get through the process first dodd 
said 
the bush administration has said that even if the sandinistas 
win in a fair election better relations depend on their good 
behavior and stopping aid to el salvadors leftist rebels the 
sandinistas deny supplying the rebels with weapons 
carter and the other major observer missions the organization 
of american states and the united nations group have said they are 
optimistic about election day 
they have also emphasized the importance of what follows 
will there be reconciliation what will happen with the 
contras carter asked what will be the future relationship of 
nicaragua and the united states 
if the election is clean carter said the bush administration 
should end the us economic embargo that has helped turn nicaragua 
into one of the poorest nations in the hemisphere help demobilize 
the contra rebels and reestablish full diplomatic relations with 
nicaragua 
ive urged our country to honor the process that has evolved 
here and to give credit to the nicaraguan people for having 
established what i consider to be a very admirable campaign 
procedure and a superb system for holding the elections 
tomorrow 
carter spoke at a news conference and then in an interview with 
a small group of reporters 
he said the winners and the losers sunday have a critical 
continuing role in the reconciliation of this badly divided nation 
will there be a continuing commitment to the level of 
democracy freedom openness of political campaigning a sense of 
pluralism a respect for human rights thats a question to 
answered by the victor he said 
will those defeated participate in a constructive way a 
minority way will there be reconciliation what will happen with 
the contras 
carter said peace talks with the usbacked contra rebels 
should begin immediately whatever the outcome 
i would hope that no matter who wins even the opposition 
parties that the sandinistas would begin immediate talks with the 
contras he said 
throughout the bitter campaign president daniel ortega has 
accused the coalition backing his main challenger publisher 
violeta barrios de chamorro of being in league with the rebels

the nations governors parted with the white 
house saturday over the level of funding necessary for the popular 
preschool program head start 
the debate during the first session of the national governors 
associations winter meeting centered on the national educational 
goals outlined recently by president bush 
before the formal opening of their debate nga chairman terry 
branstad the republican governor of iowa declared that we 
believe that it is not acceptable to just let american education 
sit where it is today there has to be radical change 
many of the goals are very ambitious and they may be extremely 
difficult to achieve branstand said 
budget director richard g darman was appearing before the 
governors on sunday and the state officials were having dinner 
with bush at the white house the governors also were to meet with 
bush on monday 
although they expanded the student achievement goal the most 
controversial action came in the objectives approved as part of the 
socalled readiness goal 
bush in his state of the union address proposed that by the year 
2000 all children in america will start school ready to learn his 
focus was on 4yearolds 
the nga education task force at the urging of cochairman gov 
bill clinton of arkansas approved the objective to fully fund head 
start which provides preschool services such as breakfast lunch 
and health screening to needy children between the ages of 3 and 5 
under the approved objective the federal government should 
work with the states to develop early intervention strategies for 
children all eligible children should have access to head start 
chapter i or some other successful preschool program with strong 
parental involvement our first priority must be to provide at 
least one year of preschool for all disadvantaged children 
maryland gov william donald schaefer pushed to include chapter 
i in the objective although that program aids disadvantaged 
elementary and secondary students 
ohio gov richard celeste gov john ashcroft of missouri and 
gov ray mabus of mississippi led the push to insert language to 
fully fund the preschool program 
asked later whether the white house would have problems with the 
head start language clinton said i dont know i hope not 
clinton noted that the bush administration would have until the 
year 2000 to accomplish that objective 
however roger porter white house domestic policy adviser was 
noncommital 
i cant say anything until everythings over said porter 
noting that bush last year proposed spending 250 million for the 
program and has asked for 500 million for fiscal year 1991 
the task force estimated it would cost about 15 billion to 
fully fund the program 
the governors also broadened the language of the student 
achievement goal 
bush had said that by the year 2000 american students will 
leave grades four eight and 12 having demonstrated competency in 
challenging subject matter including english mathematics 
science history and geography 
rather than changing the goal as clinton had suggested the task 
force agreed to add that every school in america will ensure 
that all students learn to use their minds well so they may be 
prepared for responsible citizenship further learning and 
productive employment in our modern economy 
its pretty hard to disagree with this said porter 
chuckling 
the conference ends on tuesday with house speaker thomas foley 
dwash discussing the congressional agenda 
the nga session was the first opportunity for the governors to 
begin putting their own stamp on the drive to improve the nations 
educational system 
we are here to create a national consensus to make american 
education world class said branstad we believe it is not 
acceptable to just let american education sit where it is today 
there has to be radical change 
branstad said that even after the governors approve the 
objectives this will remain a dynamic process and adjustments and 
improvements will be made along the way

the search for hilary is over but the war for 
her has widened 
americas most famed child custody battle has boiled across two 
oceans in just the past week first into the courtrooms of britain 
and now into those of new zealand hilary foretich 7 12 years 
old has been found by her fathers investigators living with her 
maternal grandparents in christchurch 
and there presumably within days the fight which has cost the 
girls mother alone nearly 2 million and more than two years in 
jail will resume both parents intend to be there with the 
prospect that another nations courts will become embroiled in a 
case which already has produced more than 450 pleadings before us 
judges with no end in sight 
hilary is the daughter of jean elizabeth morgan the 42yearold 
washington plastic surgeon who has persistently charged her 
exhusband eric foretich with sexually abusing the child having 
failed to support those allegations to the satisfaction of any 
court she sent hilary into hiding and spent 759 days in jail 
rather than accord foretich his legal visitation rights an act 
which earned the mother in countless hearts a martyrs stature 
her sympathizers included the congress and president bush who 
signed the legislation which freed her last september from 
municipal judge herbert dixons indeterminate sentence for contempt 
foretich 45 a dental surgeon in suburban falls church va 
never yielded meanwhile in his search for hilary 
he made several trips to great britain where just days ago a 
bbc talkshow producer di burgess was forced under court order 
obtained by foretichs attorneys to reveal what she had learned in 
the wake of filming a documentary on the case and that in short 
was that the child under the name ellen morgan had attended a 
girls prep school in plymouth england in the 198788 school 
year while living with her grandparents 
within days foretichs investigators tracked the older couple 
william and antonia morgan to their current home in new zealand 
at christchurch about 190 miles southwest of the capital city of 
wellington it had long been speculated that elizabeth morgan had 
entrusted hilary to her parents but their whereabouts remained a 
mystery 
their role discovered the elder morgans obtained an order from 
a new zealand family court on friday which temporarily entitles 
them to retain custody of hilary according to roger carson 
detective chief inspector in christchurch he said a further 
hearing is scheduled this week 
i found my daughter foretich said early saturday before 
leaving for new zealand im elated 
but neither he nor ms morgan would predict what legal fates 
await them or hilary i dont have any illusions that this is 
going to be easy foretich said 
ms morgan meanwhile seemed almost relieved that her 
threeyear secret was out while declining to reveal whether she 
had had any contact with hilary since her release from jail she 
said i can tell you i talked to her at length today and we had 
a heavenly conversation 
ms morgan and her new husband us appeals judge paul michel 
spent several hours saturday with her attorney stephen sachs 
their first objective to convince dixon the superior court judge 
who jailed her to return her passport without which she cannot 
legally travel to new zealand they plan to argue for that on 
monday 
ms morgan declined to give an accounting of her parents 
travels or to say how long they have been in new zealand 
she said though that she had been assured that new zealand has 
very strong statutes protecting children and that the court there 
will make no decision until hilary has been evaluated by an expert 
in child sexual abuse but she also acknowledged that many nations 
routinely respect the findings of one anothers courts in child 
custody cases 
im not a foreteller of the future she said i would like 
to think that our courts would offer her what ive been asking at 
the moment if i brought her back today she would not be 
protected 
for years each parent has accused the other of making hilarys 
life a nightmare in the us courts the case is called civil 
action no d 68483 to the american public it is the elizabeth 
morgan story even as every judge along the way has deemed it 
unsupported by evidence 
ms morgan has claimed there was physical evidence scarring 
that foretich sexually abused their daughter to that foretich 
countered in court that the scars were the consequence of injuries 
caused by ms morgan herself to stage photographic evidence to 
bolster her claims a virginia judge dismissed the mothers suit 
for exclusive custody when she refused to produce her daughter in 
court 
foretich recently separated from his fourth wife elizabeth 
morgan was the third has said ive made some poor decisions in 
some of the women ive been associated with but i did not rape 
my children that i did not do id blow my brains out first 
by his account ms morgan is insane totally evil 
at one point ms morgan also accused foretichs parents both 
over 70 of sexually abusing hilary on the girls visits to 
foretichs early georgian home modeled after the presidents house 
at his alma mater the college of william and mary 
by their account they had driven up from gloucester point va 
each time hilary was brought to their sons house on the advice of 
a lawyer friend who had advised him to keep the place in 
walltowall people because of a developing trend in child 
custody cases accusations of sexual abuse 
among others who visited the house at the same time as young 
hilary was foretichs other daughter heather now 10 born to his 
second wife sharon foretich and in 1985 sharon foretich 
following morgans example accused him of sexually abusing heather 
foretich contended that his second and third wives had colluded 
on their cases and that heather had been coached he took and 
passed two liedetector tests on his behavior with the two 
children and a virginia court ruled that sharon foretich had not 
proved her allegation either

ortega will be reelected 
he has often said bush should come to nicaragua to understand 
its reality 
his invitation appeared to be another pitch to bring the united 
states to the negotiating table 
ortega said there is mutual distrust between the united states 
and nicargua 
it is not easy to change this situation that the united states 
caused he said referring to the us support of the contra 
rebels 
the united states says nicaragua has been shipping arms to 
salvadoran rebels and secretary of state james a baker said 
thursday that even if the sandinistas win a fair election a 
substantial period of good behavior would be required before 
relations could be normalized 
i can understand bakers tone it requires not only the good 
will of both countries but the combined action of the 
international community in favor of an agreement to overcome our 
differences ortega said 
he said spanish president felipe gonzalez who has good 
communication with bush could be a good intermediary between 
nicaragua and the united sates 
i have talked to gonzalez about this several times he said 
ortega once again refused to say flatly that his government 
would not in the future send arms to leftist rebels of the 
farabundo marti national liberation front in el salvador 
he said he has stated repeatedly that nicaragua is not sending 
weapons to the salvadoran rebels but the united states believes 
otherwise a plane from nicaragua was shot down in el salvador last 
november carrying rockets for the rebels 
the united states and nicargua must sit down and discuss 
this he said we said before we are not sending weapons we 
have asked the united nations to verify this 
sources close to the nicaraguan government said the sandinistas 
had made a policy decision not to send arms to the fmln after a 
central american summit conference on dec 12 
ortega said central american presidents have a written agreement 
not to allow weapons to be sent to rebel groups in the region but 
that the united states does not respect this agreement 
he added the united states says it is sending only humanitarian 
assistance to the contra rebels in nicaragua but that equipment 
can be used to set up ambushes 
the us aid consists of nonlethal items such as food tents 
and boots but the sandinistas point out that boots can help troops 
in the jungle 
the nicaraguan president also said in answer to another 
question that sandinista defense expenditures would be reduced as 
the war with the usbacked contras winds down 
nicaragua currently has the largest armed force by far in the 
region 
all central american presidents agree that an arms race does 
not favor economic and social development he said

a prominent human rights activist has 
been arrested in the government crackdown on the movement for 
multiparty democracy an associate said saturday 
the arrest was reported on the eve of planned nationwide 
demonstrations to demand an end to a 29yearold ban on political 
parties in this himalayan kingdom 
government spokesman radhey sham bista refused to comment on the 
reported arrest 
the human rights activist mathura prasad shrestha was taken 
away by policemen from his katmandu home late friday to an 
undisclosed location said debendra raj panday the vicepresident 
of the human rights organization of nepal 
panday said he was told about shresthas arrest by sources 
other than his family but he refused to elaborate 
he said shrestha is a member of the forum for protection of 
human rights which works closely with pandays group 
shrestha a professor of community medicine at the teaching 
hospital of tribhuvan university in katmandu had organized a rally 
by doctors and medical students on friday to protest the deaths of 
demonstrators during the democracy movement 
i think that is what prompted the government action the 
government is so intolerant panday said 
the government says 12 protesters have died since last sunday 
when two banned political groups the nepali congress party and a 
leftwing coalition launched a campaign to demand restoration of 
multiparty democracy most victims died in police gunfire 
activists allege that the death toll is nearly double the 
government figure they also say that at least 1000 people have 
been arrested and that some were being tortured in jail 
the government says 175 people have been arrested and denies 
allegations of torture 
panday said he along with shrestha and other human rights 
activists met prime minister marich mansingh shresta on friday to 
express concern at the repressive measures of the government 
it was an unproductive meeting and the prime minister had no 
cogent argument to put before us he said adding that the 
twohour meeting often became heated 
protest leaders said they planned demonstrations nationwide on 
sunday to protest the killings during the government crackdown 
political demonstrations are banned in nepal 
nepals twoyear experiment with a westernstyle democracy ended 
in 1961 when king mahendra the father of the present monarch 
king birendra dissolved the government of the nepali congress 
party he accused it of corruption and poor administration and 
banned political parties

a decade of sandinista pride and us 
hostility toward nicaragua goes on the line sunday as voters decide 
whether to stick with their leftist government for six more years 
the candidates of the two top parties sandinista president 
daniel ortega and violeta barrios de chamorro of the united 
national opposition or uno embody the choices for nicaraguas 
future 
these elections constitute a gigantic and irreversible step in 
the process toward a greater democratization and reconciliation of 
the nation ortega wrote in an editorial published saturday in 
the sandinista party newspaper barricada 
the sandinistas have put a priority on not just winning or 
winning fairly but also on appearing to win fairly 
to that end they have invited election observers including the 
organization of american states the united nations and former 
president jimmy carter ismary castillo a spokeswoman for the 
supreme electoral council said saturday that at least 3000 
observers had been accredited and that in the end there would 
probably be 4000 from more than 40 groups 
us policy is also at stake if the sandinistas win a fair vote 
it will be difficult for president bush to maintain the hostility 
of the past should mrs chamorro win the us hostility is 
expected to end 
ortega said saturday that he would invite bush to his 
inauguration as part of an effort to normalize relations after 10 
years of bitterness 
the doors of nicaragua are open to the president of the united 
states he told a group of journalists 
ortega has been favored in polls but his opponents say 
nicaraguans are afraid to reveal their true feelings outside a 
truly secret ballot box about 175 million of nicaraguas 35 
million people are registered to vote 
the tough guerrilla fighter in ortega has refused to bow to the 
united states which is called the enemy of humanity in the 
sandinista front anthem 
lately the statesman has prevailed over the rebel sending 
conciliatory overtures to washington 
with changes in the east bloc siphoning off aid and reducing the 
moral authority of the extreme left the sandinistas are eager to 
restore normal relations with washington to help right their 
battered economy 
the sandinistas have released political prisoners said they 
wanted a mixed economy and pledged there will be no more 
expropriations of private property 
ortegas life has been dedicated to the sandinista cry that 
the past will never return a past that included us military 
and economic intervention and rightwing dictatorships mrs 
chamorro and uno he says are the heirs to that legacy 
mrs chamorro portrays herself as a torchbearer for the 
democratic ideals of her slain husband revered civic leader pedro 
joaquin chamorro and of his trademark promise that nicaragua 
will be a republic again 
mrs chamorros bitterness at what she considers the 
sandinistas betrayal of those ideals and the nations deep 
economic crisis are unos two top drawing cards 
on this bright day which announces the end of the dark night 
of sandinismo i raise my flag of national reconciliation mrs 
chamorro told some 60000 supporters at unos final rally a week 
ago 
the sandinista national liberation front has two points in its 
favor it helped free nicaragua from years of dictatorship in 1979 
and it has given the common nicaraguan a sense of national pride in 
standing up to the colossus to the north as the united states 
is often called 
the sandinistas are counting on that grassroots loyalty and 
pride to defeat mrs chamorro whom they call an instrument of 
us policy 
they admit to some errors but blame the economic crisis on the 
long war against ussupported contra guerrillas and a us 
economic embargo 
uno promises to lift nicaragua from the dubious distinction of 
being called by some experts the poorest nation in the western 
hemisphere and to finally bring true democracy after 45 years of 
somoza family rule and 10 years of sandinismo 
ortega has said he is not running against uno but against 
president bush in fact the sandinistas believe that with a 
certified election in hand bush will agree to deal with ortega 
ortega has said the elections mark the beginning of an era 
where the united states recognizes nicaraguas right to 
selfdetermination 
also hanging in the balance are nicaraguas relations with its 
neighbors who worry about the sandinista military machine and fear 
it backs leftist guerrillas in el salvador 
the sandinista front the enfant terrible of the region will be 
transformed just for having gone through what many consider 
nicaraguas first truly free elections this century 
from its original project of a cubanstyle oneparty state the 
sandinistas own guerrilla movement has been forced to turn into a 
party organized to win elections 
ortega himself has evolved from a dourfaced president to a 
modern candidate who smiles kisses babies and jumps on stage in 
jeans and bright cotton shirts while waving the redandblack 
sandinista flag

about 70 blocks of downtown seattle lost 
electrical power for several hours saturday after a fire in a 
transformer vault 
no injuries were reported but the outage darkened hotel lobbies 
and shut down switching equipment for the washington state lottery 
leaving some people unable to buy tickets on the night of a 6 
million drawing one of the states largest in months 
the fire department responded about 1130 am and doused it by 
150 pm a fire dispatcher said 
city light spokesman hugh mcintosh said power was restored at 
335 pm to the entire area 
there was less damage than we had feared mcintosh said 
after initially indicating power restoration could take days 
the area affected was bigger than and included the section 
that was without power during a similar transformer vault fire in 
august 1988 in that incident power was out for three days 
mcintosh said 
the fire apparently started in a device that works like a 
circuit breaker in the olympic building he said the vault is in 
the buildings basement 
the primary electric cables were across the room and were 
undamaged he said the vault contains three transformers and three 
cables the protector device was replaced allowing the power to 
come back on he said 
city light had closed down those cables plus three others at a 
nearby substation when news of the fire was received he said 
those six cables or circuits constitute most of the downtown 
network he said 
the area of the power outage encompassed pike place market 
several major department stores the seattle aquarium and the port 
of seattle 
lottery spokesman dick paulson said 417 of the lottery systems 
980 terminals in the state from south seattle to the canadian 
border were without power because of the fire the terminals are 
connected to a switching center located in the westin building 
people in four counties were unable to buy tickets but the 
drawing would take place as usual paulson said

identified confirmed the death and said police were investigating 
the circumstances 
israel radio identified the victim as ahmed hawajeh of the 
village of naalin near the west bank town of ramallah 
his death raised to 189 the number of arabs killed by fellow 
palestinians on suspicion of cooperating with israeli authorities 
during the 26monthold palestinian uprising against the israeli 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
at least 658 palestinians have been killed by israeli troops or 
civilians and 43 israelis have died in the violence 
also saturday israel television reported that israel is 
prepared to accept peace talks with a palestinian delegation that 
includes a deportee and an arab living in east jerusalem

palestinians be included in the talks while at the same time 
adhering to israels insistance that it will talk to only residents 
of the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the television and both of israels radio stations reported

fifties balladeer johnnie ray known as the 
prince of wails for his vocal histrionics on such songs as 
somebody stole my gal and just walkin in the rain died 
saturday of liver failure he was 63 
ray who had entered cedarssinai medical center on feb 16 with 
liver failure died at 4 pm said hospital spokesman ron wise 
his family and friends were with him at the time of his 
death wise said 
in the early 1950s the slender boyish singer revolutionized 
popular music with his unique blend of rhythm and blues country 
and gospel punctuated with realsounding sobs 
some said his raw and emotional style opened the door to a new 
type of music that later became rock n roll 
rays first hit record was cry followed by the little 
white cloud that cried please mr sun brokenhearted 
whats the use somebody stole my gal whos sorry now 
and yes tonight josephine 
cry perhaps rays greatest hit has sold more than 25 
million copies since its original release said his publicist alan 
eichler 
rays raw and emotional style was controversial for the early 
1950s and he drew huge crowds in nightclub appearances in new york 
and elsewhere 
as the press reached for phrases to describe his performance 
ray was crowned at various times as the prince of wails the 
nabob of sob the howling success the song wringer the 
cry guy and the master of misery 
of course the days are gone of the screaming teenagers and 
nobody had them screaming more than i did ray recalled in a 1984

four years after the united states 
encouraged ferdinand marcos to surrender power to corazon aquino 
harsh rhetoric and wide differences over us military bases have 
strained usfilipino relations 
the problems have emerged nearly three months after us 
warplanes helped save mrs aquino from military mutineers 
ironically the intervention may have aggravated relations by 
encouraging her government to assert its independence from its 
former colonial power 
since her highly publicized snub of defense secretary dick 
cheney last week the government has tried to soften its rhetoric 
on the advice of its ambassador to washington emmanuel pelaez 
but the strains also have been exacerbated by statements from 
american officials questioning the political survivability of mrs 
aquino who was touted as the savior of democracy when she was 
swept to power on feb 25 1986 uprising against marcos 
let me just acknowledge to you that relations are in a 
bumpy path right now us ambassador nicholas platt said in a tv 
interview last week were in some turbulent air 
relations with washington began to sour last month after 
congress cut 96 million from the bush administrations philippine 
aid package 
filipinos considered this a violation of the october 1988 
agreement under which the united states offered 962 million over 
two years in return for use of clark air base the subic bay naval 
base and four smaller installations through the end of their lease 
in 1991 
talks on extending the lease are expected to begin in a few 
weeks but any agreement must be ratified by twothirds of the 
philippines 23member senate many in the 195member house of 
representatives have urged mrs aquino to postpone talks on the 
bases until aid is restored 
before cheneys visit mrs aquino said she would not receive 
him because she was angry over negative us media reports on her 
administration 
filipino officials now insist the snub was to demonstrate 
anger over aid cuts but mrs aquino who bristles at criticism 
cited only the press reports making it appear her decision was 
more emotional than political 
filipino diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the philippine embassy in washington warned the administration 
that the snub and strong antiamerican statements from congressmen 
and commentators threatened to undermine us support 
the apparent attempt by the aquino government to distance itself 
from washington stems from the sensitive nature of the bases issue 
and a desire to display independence 
an influential minority here believes the bases infringe on 
sovereignty and that the presence of military men contributes to 
prostitution and drug addiction 
unlike south koreans who face an enemy to the north filipinos 
generally perceive no external military threat therefore us 
arguments that the bases are essential for national and regional 
defense carry little weight here 
last year mrs aquino noted to foreign reporters that the 
presence of us troops failed to deter japan from invading in 1941 
and doubtless encouraged the attack 
filipinos consider the bases a business deal renting territory 
in return for cash and say failure to pay constitutes a 
breach of contract 
the need to stand up to the americans was made more urgent 
by us intervention in the december coup attempt us warplanes 
from clark flew air cover for government forces and their 
intervention was widely seen as decisive in defeating the uprising 
but the intervention also encouraged a belief that mrs aquino 
owes her political survival to the americans and will ultimately 
agree to extend the bases at terms favorable to the united states 
last january deputy assistant secretary of state david 
lambertson said the danger of a new coup attempt exists and 
that corruption remains a real problem in the philippines 
some filipino officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
believe such statements are a pressure tactic to force the 
government to accept an unfavorable bases agreement 
officials here are deeply sensitive about such statements from 
washington because they recall the buildup of criticism of the 
marcos administration culminating in the united states abandoning 
its longtime ally in favor of mrs aquino 
us diplomats here also speaking on condition of anonymity 
fear that the current spate of criticism from washington may 
actually encourage military dissidents to try another coup they 
reason that coup plotters might be led to believe that washington 
would not intervene again in an effort to convince the philippines 
of the bases value

president bush and west german chancellor 
helmut kohl held talks saturday to discuss the polish border 
question and german reunification 
kohl spent the weekend with bush at the presidents snowswept 
retreat at camp david 
during three hours of talks saturday afternoon kohl discussed 
with bush ways to approach the problem of polish borders west 
german spokesman dieter vogel told reporters 
the two leaders were meeting again after dinner on saturday and 
then resuming their talks after attending church on sunday he said 
kohl reiterated his assertion that only a reunified germany 
could give a final guarantee to poland that the border question is 
closed vogel said 
poland is worried about demands by some german conservatives 
that germany be allowed to retake territory that was within german 
borders until it was transferred to poland by the world war ii 
victors 
but vogel said kohl suggested a number of ways in which the two 
german states could reassure poles in the meantime including talks 
with the polish government or a joint declaration 
during three hours of talks saturday afternoon bush and kohl 
also discussed a range of issues affecting reunification vogel 
said 
the two leaders were joined by close advisers and the american 
side said the two german states should begin soon to consult with 
the four powers as they make progress in their reunification talks 
in parallel consultations before the formal twoplusfour talks 
begin he said 
vogel said bush told kohl of his assessment of developments in 
sovietamerican relations and armsreduction talks 
the president stressed that the west should support soviet 
president mikhail gorbachevs attempts to change the soviet union 
vogel said 
i view this as a very important discussion bush said as he 
walked out to meet kohl who arrived by helicopter from 
washingtondulles international airport in virginia theres a 
lot of keen interest not just in europe but around the world on 
these discussions were going to have 
bush declined to answer reporters questions about the substance 
of the talks noting he and kohl would hold a news conference on 
sunday morning before kohls return to germany 
bush bundled up against the icy morning air in a leather 
fliers jacket and gloves greeted kohl and his wife at the landing 
pad with a hearty welcome wlcome 
wunderbar wonderful replied kohl who was dressed in a 
business suit with no coat 
in this time of dramatic change germanamerican ties are of 
essential significance kohl said through a translator 
bush hustled the west german into a golf cart to drive to the 
camp david living quarters while barbara bush took the wheel of a 
second cart and chauffeured mrs hannelore kohl 
the two leaders were discussing the full range of issues 
related to changes in eastern europe according to white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater 
coming at this volatile juncture their talks at camp david were 
seen as critical in making sure the two allies are together a 
german official said 
in addition the kohl visit was considered an important symbol 
of close ties between the two governments three weeks before east 
germany holds an election that is to precede reunification talks 
kohl himself faces election in west germany next dec 2 against 
stiff opposition from the social democrats 
while kohl has agreed with bush that a reunified germany should 
remain a member of nato and nato troops should remain in west 
germany the social democrats contend there will be no need for 
nato if the warsaw pact continues to diminish in importance 
the soviet foreign ministrys policymaking body on saturday 
added another facet to the issue by ruling out nato membership for 
a unified germany 
membership in nato for a reunified germany would lead to an 
impermissible violation of the militarystrategic balance the 
foreign ministry collegium said in a statement issued by the 
official tass news agency 
kohl recently created some uneasiness in washington with his 
suggestion that the conference on security and cooperation in 
europe a 35nation pact that includes the united states oversee 
nato troop deployments and reductions effectively superseding nato 
itself 
agreement to unify the two germanys was reached earlier this 
month in ottawa during talks between east and west germany and the 
four world war ii victors that divided them the united states 
france britain and the soviet union 
joining bush for this weekends talks were baker and national 
security adviser brent scowcroft

permanently on 998 percent of daily domestic flights 
i would probably go into the bathroom and smoke a cigarette 
said new york stockbroker art lehne who has smoked for 32 of his 
55 years 
tampering with an automatic smoke detector is a federal offense 
punishable with a 2000 fine lehne already has been arrested and 
fined 40 for defiantly lighting up on nonsmoking commuter trains 
to new york 
lehnes willingness to break the law shows how much the tables 
have turned 
where nonsmokers trying to avoid secondhand smoke once were 
forced to move smokers now must contend with a shrinking group of 
permissible spaces in which to continue their habit 
airport terminals and amtrak trains may not be far behind 
according to the authors of the ban sen frank lautenberg dnj 
and rep richard durbin dill 
antismoking initiatives are taking on new life in president 
bushs cabinet health and human services secretary louis sullivan 
on friday asked athletic associations to reject sponsorships by 
tobacco companies sullivan also has attacked cigarette makers for 
targeting advertising on minorities women and the young 
the airline smoking law an extension of the twohour ban the 
senator and congressman won at the end of 1987 exempts flights 
abroad and those longer than six hours headed to alaska and hawaii 
the result we think will be happier healthier airline 
customers and a safer healthier workplace for airline employees 
lautenberg said 
but dan lauria a spokesman for the tobacco institute said he 
could barely keep up with telephone calls from irate smokers 
accusing the tobacco lobbying group of abandoning them 
theyre miserable lauria said of the smoking public we 
are telling the people the law is the law were telling people not 
to smoke in the airliners bathroom its dangerous to the 
plane 
lautenberg durbin and a host of health organizations say the 
ban will protect passengers and flight crews from gases and smoke 
particles recirculated in cabin air 
a new report just issued by the department of transportation 
proves once again that our concerns were wellfounded that study 
found that longterm exposure to tobacco smoke in airplanes 
represents a significant risk of premature death lautenberg said 
the study found 1215 premature cancer deaths among every 
100000 cabin crew members breathing cabin air 
thats a risk that no one should have to take he said 
although tobacco interests dispute the findings 
nonsmoking frequent fliers applaud the measure 
it definitely will be much more comfortable said kimberly 
smith a 30yearold washington computer consultant who travels on 
business several times each month i wont feel as though my 
privacy or space is being invaded against my will 
she said she particularly would appreciate the change on longer 
flights when even in a nonsmoking section after several hours 
the smoke still ends up circulating through the filtration system 
juliette d lenoir national vice president of the association 
of flight attendants said the new policy has been welcomed by the 
nations 90000 flight attendants 
we received tremendous support nationwide because flight 
attendants and the american public said it is not unreasonable to 
demand a healthy workplace and a smokefree travel environment 
she said 
the american lung association reported last week that several 
airlines will exceed the law for example virgin atlantic airways 
is offering smokeless flights from new york to london and usair is 
banning smoking on its flights to the bahamas and bermuda 
the association has passed out walletsized cards suggesting 
ways smokers can make it through nonsmoking trips with flying 
colors they include breathing exercises stretching drinking 
nonalcoholic and caffeinefree beverages and napping 
ahron leichtman president of citizens against tobacco smoke a 
coalition of 100 antismoking groups that lobbied for the ban says 
the key is to treat smokers with compassion while safeguarding the 
health of nonsmoking passengers 
airlines have been making some preparations for the change 
sara dornacker a united airlines spokeswoman in chicago said 
the airline has agreed to make refunds or accommodations for 
smokers unable to handle long hours on smokefree planes by 
switching direct flights to flights with interim stops they can 
dash into an airport terminal for a quick cigarette 
since feb 15 all united arrival announcements have mentioned 
the new policy while information and entertainment guides in seat 
pockets also spell out the change 
at trans world airlines in st louis spokesman jim faulkner 
said preboarding announcements since feb 14 have included news of 
the ban 
calls to travel agencies last week indicated no passenger 
complaints about the new system

a top official in the countrys 
leading antiapartheid group said saturday that fighting with other 
black factions is huring efforts to end white rule 
the official walter sisulu said newly freed anc leader nelson 
mandela would join him at a rally sunday in natal province to plead 
for peace among warring factions 
more than 2500 blacks have died since 1986 in fighting among 
supporters of the african national congress or anc members of 
the inkatha political party of zulu leader mangosuthu buthelezi and 
various criminal gangs 
sisulu who is leading the anc peace delegation into the zulu 
townships around durban and pietermaritzburg said saturday he 
would brief mandela before the mass rally in an open sports field 
i will leave him in no doubt as to the need to call for an end 
to the violence said sisulu we have a gigantic task in 
leading a liberation movement this distasteful violence which has 
caused so much trouble and pain to our people is a great obstacle 
to our cause in many ways 
nine blacks the youngest age 12 were buried saturday in the 
eastern cape province town of uitenhage as the result of factional 
fighting over the past two weeks between anc supporters and 
supporters of the panafricanist movement that movement opposes 
negotiations with the white government and participation of whites 
in the struggle to end apartheid the anc has said it will send a 
delegation to talk with officials of the white government 
raymond mhlaba a mandela codefendant freed from a life prison 
term in october along with sisulu signed a peace pact in uitenhage 
last week designed to end the fighting funeral speakers urged the 
community to put the pact into effect 
at the durban news conference saturday sisulu said the anc is 
glad that inkatha leaders had urged their supporters to attend the 
sunday rally to welcome mandela 
the two major groups fighting for political supremacy in the 
natal townships have always had separate rallies and violence 
usually follows when the crowds head home through the opposite 
camps neighborhoods 
organizers said they expected 175000 to 200000 people at the 
rally sunday 
buthelezi reportedly did not plan to attend 
he was a friend of mandelas before the founder of the anc 
guerrilla wing went to prison in 1962 for sabotage and plotting to 
overthrow the government buthelezi consistently called for 
mandelas release from prison during the next 27 years until he was 
freed early this month 
however buthelezi opposes sanctions and guerrilla attacks 
which the anc uses he has also accused the anc of using its radio 
broadcasts to call for his death and the murder of other inkatha 
leaders 
exiled anc leaders accuse buthelezi of collaborating with 
apartheid by heading the zulu tribal government 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

the same fraud selfdealing rapid growth 
accounting gimmicks and lax regulation that forced a 166 billion 
federal bailout of savings and loans last year also threatens the 
insurance industry a house panel has concluded 
the energy and commerce committees investigative panel said in 
a report saturday that the cost of liquidating and paying off the 
claims of failed insurance companies now reaches into billions of 
dollars 
while there is no evidence yet of an insurance crisis comparable 
to the sampl debacle the subcommittee said the same early warnings 
of potential disaster are abundantly evident as they were five 
years ago in the thrift industry 
in a 76page report the panel said its inquiries into both 
insurance and thrift enterprises show that a relatively few 
crooks scoundrels and incompetents are capable of bankrupting huge 
companies and possibly an entire industry 
the subcommittee spent 18 months investigating four insurance 
companies now insolvent with unpaid claims or other liabilities 
totaling more than 5 billion and the near failure of two other 
companies 
it attributed their problems to rapid expansion extensive and 
complex reinsurance arrangements underpricing of premiums for 
remote but expensive risks false reports reckless management 
lack of adequate reserves fraud and selfdealing 
ultimately the public bears the burden through higher 
insurance premiums or insurance claims that arent paid said 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of both the investigations 
panel and its parent committee in some cases the taxpayer may 
have to replenish the guaranteed funds 
the four failed companies cited in the report are mission 
insurance co and transit casualty co both of los angeles 
integrity insurance co of paramus nj and angloamerican 
insurance co of dallas 
all four companies were engaged primarily in commercial 
propertycasualty insurance a highly competitive 477 billion 
segment of an industry with assets totaling 175 trillion 
the driving force was quick profits in the short run with no 
apparent concern for the longterm wellbeing of the company its 
policyholders its employees its reinsurors or the public the 
subcommittee said 
it found that none of the officials responsible for running the 
four failed companies has been prosecuted or even cited by state 
insurance agencies responsible for regulating the industry 
state regulators the subcommittee said appear bogged down by 
jurisdictional restraints unreliable information limited 
penalties they can impose and an unwillingness to pursue wrondoers 
it said there is a shocking reluctance in some states to 
deny or withdraw an insurance license unless a person has a legally 
proven record of criminal fraud 
as a result there is not meaningful deterrent to dissuade 
those who are inclined or tempted to plunder insurance companies 
the report said 
with inadequate reserves some of the companies were using 
premiums from new policies to pay incoming claims in the 
wellknown ponzi scheme pattern the subcommittee said 
the report stopped short of recommending a federal takeover of 
insurance regulation a function that was delegated exclusively to 
state governments under the 1945 mccarranferguson act 
but current problems could give rise to reconsidering that 
delegation it said 
possible federal intervention could include a law empowering 
national associations of state regulators of insurance companies to 
develop and enforce adequate solvency standards 
particularly in the aftermath of the savings and loan 
catastrophe congress must make certain that all insurers are 
financially able to pay claims said rep thomas j bliley jr of 
virginia the subcommittees ranking republican 
dingell said the panel would hold two hearings on the report in 
march

a sky diver was knocked unconscious during 
an 80person freefall saturday and fell to his death after another 
diver tried to deployt his chute but couldnt a skydiving company 
official said 
paul williams 40 of kentucky was one of the last people to 
jump from four planes at 15000 feet when he collided with another 
diver and lost consciousness said susan basse an owner of the 
palatka paracenter 
another sky diver seeing the man flailing in free fall 
attempted to get to him and pull the rip cord but was unable to 
the best of our knowledge unfortunately he never regained 
consciousness and died on impact ms basse said 
williams was part of a group divers from across the southeastern 
united states who joined in an 80person formation 
theres a pretty large concentration of sky divers well 
never know exactly what happened but i believe he just misjudged 
his distance from another sky diver ms basse said 
this was an experienced jumper in excess of 2600 sky dives 
were talking a serious jumper who made a mistake unfortunately 
it was a fatal mistake she said 
the man landed on one of the runways at kay larkin airport 
about a halfmile from a crowd of friends and relatives who had 
come to see the jump ms basse said several of williams friends 
from kentucky but no family members were there 
most of the other divers in the jump continued to join hands and 
legs and landed safely after breaking the formation at 4500 feet 
they probably were unaware that williams chutes failed to open 
she said 
palatka police who are investigating the accident identified 
williams but refused to release his hometown

malcolm forbes colorful owner of the business 
magazine that bears his name and an unabashed salesman for 
capitalism died of a heart attack at his home saturday he was 70 
he was pronounced dead of a heart attack at 430 pm at 
timberfield his home in far hills nj where he died in his 
sleep said william donald garson director of corporate 
communications for new yorkbased forbes inc 
he was found by a houseman after failing to keep a doctors 
appointment garson said 
forbes whose frequent forays on harleydavidson motorcycles and 
hotair balloons made him a symbol of capitalist machismo had 
returned saturday morning from a trip to london 
often seen with longtime friend elizabeth taylor forbes 
appeared in newspaper celebrity columns as often as on their 
business pages 
forbes was the babe ruth of business publishing said george 
steinbrenner principal owner of the new york yankees he made 
his mark through integrity a toughness and wonderful sense of 
humor well miss him 
billionaire developer donald trump expressed shock at the death 
of his friend 
malcolm was an extraordinarily positive force in americas 
business and social life his loss takes excitement creativity and 
genuine business leadership from every american businessman 
trump said 
lee iacocca chairman of chrysler corp said malcolm forbes 
was someone who lived life to its fullest and in doing so made all 
of our lives a little more colorful he was a great businessman 
publisher and collector but more importantly a great friend to 
many we will miss him deeply 
in los angeles industrialist armand hammer released a statement 
saying the whole world will miss malcolm who brought humanity 
to the capitalist system 
forbes spent a reported 2 million on his 70th birthday party 
aug 19 he was proclaimed an honorary citizen of tangier as that 
moroccan bash which included seaside fireworks and nightlong 
dancing drew to a close on aug 21 
the nearly 1000 guests featured some of the top names in 
business industry entertainment and the arts they feasted on 
pigeon pie lamb mechoui and chicken tadjine 
chairman and chief shareholder of forbes inc forbess worth 
has been estimated at 400 million up to 1 billion by various 
sources 
experts value his companys flagship business magazine as high 
as 600 million while its american heritage magazine suburban 
newspaper real estate and art holdings almost add 100 million or 
more 
forbes magazine rode the 1980s bull market and the probusiness 
reagan era to the greatest success since its founding by forbes 
father 
since 1979 the amount of advertising space sold surged 50 
percent while rates rose sharply as biweekly forbes pulled ahead 
of fortune in ad space and gained ground on business week which 
publishes more often than its two main competitors 
according to publishers information bureau reports all three 
big business magazines will post record ad revenue this year 
forbes made the first free flight over beijing in a hotair 
balloon and set six world ballooning records he rode his harleys

steve would inherit 51 percent of the voting control of the forbes 
empire 
but along with that the son might also inherit a potential tax 
nightmare the paper reported state and federal taxes on big 
estates are levied at about 55 percent and the 1987 tax reform 
closed loopholes that had eased the burden on family businesses 
the estate tax threat has shadowed forbes inc through its best 
years since forbes magazines big increase in value came 
relatively late in malcolms life 
while forbes family members declined to discuss with the times 
their estate tax plans in detail it is clear that their business 
strategy had been constrained by the prospect of a tax bill that 
could exceed 300 million 
forbes was born in englewood nj on aug 19 1919 two years 
after his father founded the magazine he was the third child of 
five born to bc bertie and adelaide forbes 
his father named after prince albert of great britain was the 
son of a poor scottish family who emigrated to the united states 
and worked his way to affluence on wall street 
in 1941 the newly graduated malcolm forbes was appointed

europe forbes fought as a staff sergeant commanding a machinegun 
unit and eventually won the bronze star and a purple heart for 
saving the lives of many of his company 
forbes was shot in the thigh and spent 10 months in 194445 
recovering 
following the war forbes joined his fathers magazine as a vice 
president with a broad mandate to modernize the journals design 
and layout

a man convicted of killing 27 people in 
the nations worst drunkendriving accident was sentenced friday to 
16 years in prison he could be eligible for parole in eight years 
carroll county circuit judge charles satterwhite denied a 
defense motion to place larry mahoney on probation and instead 
imposed the sentence recommended by the jury that convicted mahoney 
on dec 21 
satterwhite said the community would not stand for probation and 
that punishment must be strong for such a serious crime 
one survivor of the crash 18yearold tammy darnell said 
mahoney should have been sent to prison for life 
sixteen years does not take the place of the friends i lost 
she said before breaking down in tears 
mahoney a 36yearold chemical plant worker was driving the 
wrong direction on interstate 71 on may 14 1988 when he crashed 
into the front of a school bus packed with teenagers on a church 
outing twentyfour teens and three adults died 
he was convicted of 27 counts each of seconddegree manslaughter 
and firstdegree wanton endangerment 12 counts of firstdegree 
assault 14 of seconddegree wanton endangerment and one of drunken 
driving 
the recommended sentence totaled 611 years but the jury said 
the terms should run concurrently that effectively gave mahoney 16 
years he is classified as a violent offender under kentucky law 
and must serve at least half his sentence before being considered 
for parole 
defense attorney william summers urged satterwhite to make 
something positive out of the bus crash tragedy the defense 
recommended a probation plan under which mahoney would have 
lectured to schoolchildren about the dangers of drunken driving 
served volunteer time in hospital emergency wards and spent one 
year in a work release program 
judge we must do as much good with this as we possibly can 
his punishment has already been death he already has been given a 
life sentence summers said referring to mahoneys suffering 
since the crash 
prosecutor paul richwalsky jr of the state attorney generals 
office vehemently opposed probation 
he alone is responsible he alone brought us to this place 
today richwalsky said regardless of statements the defense 
would make its time for punishment 
russell baldani one of mahoneys three attorneys said earlier 
this week that satterwhites decision would be appealed 
during testimony jurors learned mahoney was upset over 
financial problems brought on by expensive medical bills for his 
daughter who suffers from a spinal birth defect and that he spent 
most of the day of the crash visiting friends and drinking beer at 
several taverns 
he testified that he only occasionally drank beer and abhorred 
hard liquor he said he didnt remember drinking hard liquor at a 
party later that evening 
he said he had no recollection of getting into his pickup and 
driving the wrong way on the interstate the collision punctured 
the gas tank of the bus sending a stream of flaming gasoline into 
the passenger compartment 
the 27 deaths were attributed to smoke inhalation but mahoneys 
attorneys contended that toxic smoke emitted from the plastic seats 
had poisoned the passengers 
when mahoney took the stand he publicly apologized for the 
tragedy 
richwalsky said earlier this week that he didnt expect fridays 
hearing to be the last of the mahoney case 
its not over and done with he said im sure there will 
be an appeal and so we change gears and go into another arena

more than 100 militant students 
demanding the downfall of the government moved into the capitals 
roman catholic cathedral friday and refused to leave when armed 
police surrounded the church 
cathedral officials asked the students to leave and promised to 
negotiate their safe getaway but the protesters said they feared 
soldiers and police would beat them 
the students numbering about 150 chose the cathedral to win 
publicity for their protests 
the staterun media have ignored the antigovernment protests 
that began monday night when students set two cars ablaze and 
police responded with tear gas and rubber truncheons 
several students have been injured in clashes with soldiers and 
police but only a handful needed hospital treatment the students 
say there was no violence thursday 
about two dozen armed police marched through a cathedral gate 
and surrounded the modern building decorated with large stained 
glass doors and windows but they were ordered out after a more 
senior officer arrived on the scene 
there appeared to be a standoff later friday with police 
remaining outside the gates and students refusing to leave 
dozens of other students opposite the cathedral raised their 
fists at the soldiers a few yelled what has become a rallying cry 
we are opposed 
president felix houphouetboigny has ruled this west african 
nation as a oneparty state since its independence from france in 
1960 he has refused recent calls for a multiparty system saying 
it would endanger national unity 
we dont want houphouet we dont want his government one 
student protester said friday we will demonstrate until we have 
a multiparty state we want freedom 
earlier in the day student leaders announced formation of an 
independent national organization of students and school children 
to replace another union the existing group is in effect a youth 
league of the ruling democratic party 
the students claimed they have the support of 7000 of the 
22000 students at the staterun national university of ivory coast 
however demonstrations have been limited to little more than 
300 students at a time the students say the low numbers reflect 
cuts in bus service between the university and surrounding 
neighborhoods

the securities and exchange commission should 
keep tabs on the amount of junk bonds held by financial 
institutions in the wake of the collapse of drexel burnham lambert 
group inc an sec nominee said friday 
philip r lochner jr deputy general counsel of time warner 
inc also told a senate panel that there might be a need for a 
national quotation system such as the one used to monitor the 
overthecounter stock market to keep track of junkbond prices 
we absolutely do need more information on this issue 
lochner said at his confirmation hearing before the senate banking 
housing and urban affairs committee 
drexel burnham lambert group parent of the wall street 
investment banking house that practically created the high risk 
high yield junk bond market filed for federal bankruptcy 
protection earlier this month rattling the already unstable market 
committee chairman donald w riegle jr dmich asked lochner 
if the sec should assemble information on what kind of financial 
institutions such as banks thrifts mutual and pension funds 
hold junk bonds and in what amount 
i think theres no systematic information on who holds junk 
debt and how long its been held lochner said i think in 
order to understand it better i think yes we absolutely do need 
more information 
riegle was the only senator present during most of the 
questioning of lochner nominated by president bush in january to 
fill the unexpired term of former sec chairman david ruder who 
returned to teaching law at northwestern university 
lochner expressed views similar to sec chairman richard c 
breeden saying that enforcement of securities laws would be a high 
priority for him particularly in an attempt to restore the 
confidence of individual investors 
lochner also said jurisdictional disputes between the sec and 
the rival commodity futures trading commission were hurting 
american competitiveness with overseas markets 
the panel also questioned arthur j hill nominee for president 
of the government national mortgage association also known as 
ginnie mae and john j adair who was nominated this week as the 
first inspector general of the resolution trust corp 
the rtc was established as part of the savings and loan industry 
bailout legislation to dispose of failed thrifts 
riegle said the committee was expected to vote on all three 
nominees next friday 
the committee also has scheduled a hearing for next friday on 
the downfall of drexel with securities and exchange commission 
chairman richard c breeden scheduled to testify 
in addition rep john d dingell chairman of the house energy 
and commerce committee has asked the sec to supply all the 
information it has on hefty bonuses drexel paid to employees before 
its bankruptcy filing on feb 13 
dingell in his capacity as chairman of the oversight and 
investigations subcommittee asked the sec to provide the 
subcommittee with the commissions analysis of these payments in 
relation to violations of both the letter and spirit of the 
applicable provisions of the federal securities laws 
the subcommittee also asked the sec to deliver by march 16 a 
copy of drexels bankruptcy contingency plan and copies of any 
minutes transcripts or other memorializations of any board of 
directors meetings where any such plan was discussed or approved

president bush said friday that the soviet 
union had taken encouraging and significant steps to correct 
violations of arms control agreements but added that serious 
concerns remain 
during the past year there has been an encouraging change in 
the soviet approach toward armscontrol compliance bush said in 
a report to congress the soviet union now appears to be willing 
to take significant action to resolve some us concerns 
bush said he hoped recent soviet actions indicate a new 
willingness also to address and resolve our remaining concerns 
while highlighting positive action bush said the soviet union 
still did not comply completely with the 1972 antiballistic missile 
treaty and the 1972 biological and toxin weapons convention 
bush noted last years admission by the kremlin that its massive 
radar complex at krasnoyarsk was a clear violation of the abm 
treaty as the united states had long argued 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze pledged last year 
that the facility would be dismantled 
bush said in his report that action would improve the 
atmosphere surrounding bilateral relations emphasizing that the 
united states will not conclude agreements on strategic or space 
weapons until concerns about krasnoyarsk are resolved 
bush credited the soviet union with constructive steps to 
correct other violations of the abm treaty even though they had not 
formally admitted they were not complying 
on another front bush said the soviet union had admitted 
technical errors in complying with a 1987 treaty to eliminate 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles and had corrected them 
during the past year bush said our insistence on 
scrupulous complaince together with improved cooperation by the 
ussr has enabled generally successful implementation of the inf 
treaty the removal of one abm treaty violation and positive 
movement toward soviet correction of the krasnoyarsk radar 
violation 
this represents encouraging and significant positive movement 
in arms control treaty compliance the president said 
in terms of chemical and biological warfare bush said the 
united states had found no basis for amending earlier conclusions 
that the soviet union was been involved in the production transfer 
and use of toxins for hostile purposes in laos cambodia and 
afghanistan 
he said there was no confirmed evidence of use of lethal agents 
since january 1984 but said the alleged violations remained a 
cause for serious concern 
moreover bush said that contrary to moscows claims the 
soviet union has maintained an active offensive biological warfare 
program and capability in violation of the 1972 biological and 
toxin weapons convention 
we judge that the soviet capability may include advanced 
biological and toxin agents of which we have little or no knowledge 
and and against which the us has no defense bush said

a faulty fuel pump apparently caused an 
air force tanker jet to explode in flight last fall killing four 
crewmen military investigators said friday 
officials at loring air force base said they determined that 
there were two explosions both in a fuel tank area in the rear of 
the plane and that the tail section separated from the fuselage 
after the second blast 
postaccident analysis of the air refueling pumps recovered 
from the crash site indicates one of two pumps was a likely 
ignition source said a statement issued by the base 
the pump reached a temperature of at least 1435 degrees before 
the explosion which occurred over the canadian town of 
perthandover new brunswick on the morning of oct 4 
residents of the area had reported that the explosion lit up the 
predawn sky and started a fire in the woods where the wreckage 
landed 
the kc135a plane which was 25 years old was a boeing 707 
reconfigured as a tanker it was used in the midair refueling of 
fighters and bombers based at loring 
the air force releasing the first detailed account of the 
events leading to the explosion said the fourengine jet took off 
from loring at 1140 pm the previous night and had completed a 
midair refueling of two planes east of newfoundland it was 
returning to loring descending from 3000 feet to 2500 feet when 
it exploded about 13 miles southsoutheast of the base 
the investigation turned up no discrepancies in the maintenance 
of the plane the crew members were technically qualified and 
toxicology tests disclosed no evidence pertinent to the 
investigation the investigators said

pioneer 11 the first spacecraft to visit 
saturn flew beyond the orbit of neptune on friday and became the 
fourth humanmade craft to exit the solar system nasa and the 
probes builder said 
we wish it a fond farewell said montye male a spokeswoman 
for trw inc which built pioneer 11 at its space amp technology 
group facility in redondo beach 
neptune is now the outermost planet pluto currently is closer 
to the sun in an elongated elliptical orbit part of which is 
beyond neptunes path 
by crossing neptunes orbit friday at a distance of 28 billion 
miles from earth pioneer 11 followed pioneer 10 and voyagers 1 and 
2 out of the solar system said peter waller spokesman for the 
national aeronautics and space administrations ames research 
center in mountain view 
both officials acknowledged that some dont consider the orbit 
of the outermost planet to be the edge of the solar system some 
scientists consider the true edge to be the heliopause where solar 
wind yields to interstellar wind an estimated 5 billion to 14 
billion miles from the sun 
a few even consider the solar system to end at the oort cloud a 
theorized but yetunseen spherical cloud of comets that may be 
located about 7 trillion to 14 trillion miles from the sun 
waller said nasa considers the pioneers and voyagers to be 
outside the solar system because to use a seafaring analogy 
once youve left land behind you dont worry about coastal 
waters 
pioneer 11 was launched april 5 1973 and visited jupiter on 
dec 2 1974 a year after pioneer 10 flew past the solar systems 
largest planet pioneer 11 whizzed by jupiter at 107373 mph which 
waller said was the fastest speed ever traveled by a spacecraft 
it passed only 26600 miles from jupiters cloud tops much 
closer than the voyager 1 and 2 flybys in 1979 and was bombarded 
by the planets intense radiation belts 
on sept 1 1979 it became the first spacecraft to explore 
saturn visiting the ringed planet 14 months ahead of voyager 1 and 
two years ahead of voyager 2 pioneer 10 didnt fly past saturn 
waller said in a telephone interview that pioneer 11 flew about 
13000 miles from saturn taking the first closeup pictures of that 
planet discovering two small moonlets and a ring and collecting 
data that scientists used to determine that the major moon titan 
was too cold for life despite the presence of organic chemicals 
although pioneer 11 was launched four years before the voyagers 
it took longer to fly beyond the outermost planets orbit because 
it is traveling through space in the same direction as the sun and 
the rest of the solar system male said 
in june 1983 pioneer 10 became the first spacecraft to pass 
beyond the planets it is now 45 billion miles from earth male 
said 
in three years it will become difficult to simultaneously 
operate pioneer 11s radio transmitter and scientific instruments 
although engineers may be able to get the spacecraft to send back 
data on solar wind until 1995 project manager richard fimmel said 
pioneer 10 with a stronger power supply may return information 
through the year 2000

a man accused of strangling and decapitating 
his brothers girlfriend was convicted of murder friday after 
witnesses described the 18yearold defendant singing rap songs 
about the killing 
ruben deases was found guilty in the may 28 murder of jennifer 
ann gardner 20 capping a trial that at one point erupted into a 
scuffle between brothers 
defense attorney glenn sedgwick put his arm around deases as the 
verdict was read deases showed little emotion at the verdict 
which the jury reached after about two hours and 15 minutes of 
deliberations 
in iowa a conviction on firstdegree murder carries a mandatory 
life sentence with no possiblity of parole unless a governor 
commutes the sentence to a set term 
the states key witness was deases 16yearold brother johnny 
who testified about the killing and said ruben had sex with the 
corpse afterward a third brother edward 21 awaits trial on 
murder charges 
the woman shared an ames apartment with the eldest of the four 
brothers eustaquio deases 23 who was out of town at the time of 
the killing took place in the apartment 
prosecutors said she died because of the younger brothers saw 
her as an impediment to their advancement in eustaquios 
cocainedealing business and witnesses said it took place soon 
after she threatened the younger brothers with a gun 
eustaquio is serving a fiveyear federal sentence for cocaine 
possession 
four youth workers testified that ruben bragged about the 
killing after his arrest and even made up rap songs about it 
one such song included the lines she thought she was cool 
and i was a fool and now shes dead and im ahead said jack 
leinen a former youth services worker at a des moines detention 
center where ruben was held 
judge md seiser had told jurors they could return a verdict of 
innocent or of guilty to charges of firstdegree murder 
seconddegree murder or voluntary manslaughter no sentencing date 
was sent 
ms gardners head was found in a ditch along a gravel road 
south of ames on may 29 and her body was found june 1 in a lake 
north of ames 
defense lawyer stephen terrill said he would appeal 
as eustaquio was led into the courtroom last week to testify for 
the prosecution he lunged across the defense table throwing 
punches and snarling obscenities at ruben 
terrill had portrayed ruben deases as a frightened little boy 
who didnt take part in the killing or the decapitation 
im afraid that ruben deases may end up paying for a crime he 
did not commit a terrible crime that his brother edward 
committed terrill told jurors in his closing arguments thursday 
but county attorney mary richards had called ruben a 
coldblooded killer and told jurors that reading at a 
fifthgrade level is no excuse for committing murder

west german opposition leaders 
joined the east german social democrats at their convention friday 
to criticize the policies of helmut kohl the west german 
chancellor 
the convention chose ibrahim boehme a 45yearold historian to 
be the partys chairman and lead it in east germanys first free 
elections march 18 
the social democrats are favored to win the elections and boehme 
could be the next premier of east germany which was ruled by 
communists from the stalinist mold until a few months ago several 
recent polls have indicated the social democrats would win at least 
50 percent of the vote 
as the convention began in the industrial city of leipzig 
former chancellor willy brandt started his weekend of east german 
campaigning with a rally in plauen a southern city 
he told an audience of 40000 as germans and as europeans we 
must cooperate in securing world peace 
west german politicians including kohl have taken advantage of 
the election campaign to speak at rallies across the country 
despite misgivings by the communistled interim government 
while lending support to sister parties in east germany the 
west germans also are seeking to establish power bases before 
reunification 
speakers from west germany often have overshadowed east german 
party leaders making some campaign rallies seem like forums on 
west german political issues 
earlier this week kohl addressed a rally of 100000 in erfurt 
and received a more enthusiastic reception that he usually gets 
back home 
national elections in west germany are scheduled for december 
and with the movement toward reunification gaining speed some west 
german politicians think it could become an allgerman ballot 
the leftleaning social democrats of west germany accuse kohl of 
rushing into unification in hopes of boosting his reelection 
chances by becoming the chancellor who reunites germany 
they want one germany but favor what they describe as a more 
cautious pace in accomplishing it their east german sister party 
is a strong advocate of reunification 
included in the west german delegation to the convention of east 
german social democrats on friday was oskar lafontaine the 
saarland state governor who is expected to be the partys 
challenger to kohl in december 
brandt who is very popular in east germany also will speak at 
the leipzig convention which continues through sunday he is to be 
made honorary chairman of the east german social democrats the 
same title he has in west germany 
lafontaines convention speech criticized kohl for not giving 
billions of dollars in immediate aid 
east germany requested 9 billion but kohl balked at providing 
it to a communistled interim government west germany did provide 
the equivalent of about 35 billion most of it for projects over 
which the east german government would have little control 
speaking to about 500 delegates lafontaine said kohls decision 
was a blow to germany unity 
he also criticized kohl for calling 1989 the year of the 
germans it was much more a year of freedom and liberation of 
the people of eastern europe he said

a former florida governor announced 
friday he has switched back to the republican party after a stint 
as a democrat to challenge gov bob martinez in the september gop 
primary 
the opportunity is there said claude r kirk jr who was 
governor from 1967 to 1971 the first republican since 
reconstruction to win the office in florida 
kirk 64 who once vetoed his own budget lost his reelection 
bid in 1970 his ability to attract votes virtually disappeared 
after he was turned out of office by democrat reubin askew 
kirk mounted another illfated gubernatorial bid as a democrat 
in 1978 when he and running mate mary singleton finished sixth in a 
field of seven two years ago kirk came in fifth in a sixway race 
for us senate 
in addition to kirk and martinez state sen marlene 
woodsonhoward of bradenton and fort lauderdale resident anthony 
martin are seeking the gop nomination gainesville businessman ben 
campen said thursday he will probably enter the race next week 
a primary against bob martinez is a farce said jm 
stipanovich the governors campaign manager theyre wasting 
their time their money and their effort 
kirk and martinez are floridas only two republican governors 
this century both won office when the democratic party was 
fractured by bitter primary battles 
kirk accompanied by his daughter claudia and former state gop 
chairman tommy thomas said he hoped to raise 13 million for his 
primary challenge 
anything more than that is obscene said kirk who dismissed 
his most recent party change as insignificant the voters of 
florida realize that the party im involved in is a kirk party as 
such philosophically 
kirk generally refrained from political attacks on martinez 
telling reporters hed unveil his campaign stands later

us disaster relief officials agreed in a 
court settlement friday to provide tens of millions of dollars to 
replace residential hotel rooms and other cheap housing destroyed 
in the san francisco earthquake 
the settlement which could cost the federal emergency 
management agency up to 50 million came in a civil lawsuit filed 
jan 19 in us district court to obtain assistance for lowincome 
people who were displaced by the oct 17 quake 
it is the first time fema has provided money to renovate 
residential hotels damaged in a disaster said lorrie jean deputy 
director and general counsel for fema 
weve done this because were basically learning how to 
respond to the unique needs of presidentially declared emergencies 
in urban areas ms jean told reporters 
the lawsuit was filed by at least four public interest agencies 
including the legal aid society of alameda county the agencies 
said at least 5000 people were left homeless because their hotel 
rooms were damaged by the quake 
stephen e ronfeldt of the legal aid society said the agencies 
agreed to settle the lawsuit because they were happy with how much 
fema was willing to bend its policies to help poor people affected 
by the quake 
the settlement was tentatively approved by us district judge 
eugene lynch who set a march 16 hearing for final approval 
it requires fema funds to cover about 1800 hotel units and 
other inexpensive housing affected and calls for fema to provide 
money for shortterm housing assistance while replacement units are 
found 
under the settlement housing units can be replaced by 
rehabilitation or through rent vouchers to owners of renovated 
apartment buildings construction of new units is not allowed 
tens of thousands of other people also could be affected by the 
settlement because it calls for fema reimbursement checks to go to 
individuals who were sharing housing with nonrelatives the agency 
had previously decided to issue one check per shared housing unit 
that was damaged in the quake

business labor and government leaders said 
friday they hope to establish pittsburgh as a major equipment 
supplier for a levitated train system that could transport 
passengers at up to 300 mph 
the magnetic levitation train nicknamed maglev could 
create jobs well into the 21st century by using the citys idled 
steel mills to build the new technology according to a report 
released by members of maglev inc 
what we want to do in the pittsburgh area is become a 
technological and manufacturing base for magnetic levitation in the 
united states said advertising executive james roddey former 
chairman of port authority transit of allegheny county and acting 
president of maglev inc 
maglev was formed to develop a 19mile demonstration project 
linking downtown pittsburgh to greater pittsburgh international 
airport 
the train which has no wheels hovers on a magnetic cushion 
over an elevated guideway car sides wrap around a guide rail 
maglev appears to be the best highspeed ground transportation 
based on cost environmental impact speed comfort and readiness 
roddey said 
the group believes magnetic levitation eventually will become 
the transportation method of choice for trips ranging from 150 to 
300 miles in the united states roddey said 
electromagnetic train technology was devised in the united 
states in 1968 but perfected in germany 
the group has just completed a preliminary study of the 
feasibility of the the future of magnetic levitation in pittsburgh 
and now is trying to raise 21 million for a more detailed study 
roddey said 
were now in the next phase to determine whether or not its 
financially possible or whether or not we can become a 
manufacturing center he said 
the 12 members of maglev inc have agreed to invest 900000 and 
staffing for the study which will take 2 years to finish an 
additional 300000 will come from the state roddey said 
the maglev promotion council a japanese trading company has 
committed about 250000 he said and the company is applying for 
12 million from federal officials 
the 19mile link to the airport could be completed as early as 
1996 roddey said it would cost 299 million to 648 million to 
design and build depending on which route to the airport is 
selected and whether a single or doubletrack system is built 
maglev incs 12 members are age westinghouse transportation 
systems inc allegheny county the city of pittsburgh usx corp 
carnegie mellon university duquesne light co the michael baker 
corp the law firm of reed smith shaw amp mcclay the tristate 
conference on steel united steelworkers of america union switch amp 
signal and transrapid international 
maglev inc officials said they are close to reaching an 
agreement for the exclusive maglev manufacturing rights in north 
america with transrapid a german consortium that has worked on the 
trains technology 
the study estimates the project would generate 96 billion in 
economic activity in the region if maglev inc is awarded 
manufacturing rights

officials who closed two elementary schools 
for fear that potentially explosive ether was stored in the 
basements said friday they later discovered the chemical had been 
removed in 1974 
students were sent home tuesday so explosives experts could 
remove crates containing cold warera packaged disaster 
hospitals which according to their labels included ether the 
crates dating from about 30 years ago were meant for use in a 
national emergency 
experts however found that the crates no longer contained 
ether said roger winner a member of the gasport fire department 
board of commissioners and a former state emergency management 
officer 
the crates were opened the ether had been removed winner 
said there were other mechanical items part of the 
operating room equipment that were in these crates 
some kinds of ether under certain conditions can have the 
explosive potential of nitroglycerin 
officials said the ether apparently was removed in 1974 when a 
directive to niagara county emergency officials warned of the 
potential danger 
nonetheless officials friday defended the decision to send home 
500 students from gasport elementary school and 470 students from 
another elementary school in the nearby community of middleport 
it was not blown out of proportion said margaret chong the 
onscene representative of the federal environmental protection 
agency there was no indication at the time that there was 
nothing in the box no labeling no information at all

ibms stock has climbed since december and 
analysts say the worlds largest computer maker is beginning to see 
the benefits of a costcutting program and stock buyback 
the stock which was down to about 94 a share in late december 
moved back into triple digits in recent weeks and was trading 
around 103 late last week 
many analysts consider international business machines corp 
shares a strong investment and say the company is bouncing back 
from a multiyear slump 
rick martin who follows ibm for prudentialbache securities 
inc recently upgraded his recommendation for ibm stock from 
hold to buy 
martin said his recommendation was based in part on the new line 
of computer workstations ibm unveiled earlier this month 
the machines aimed at the engineering and scientific markets 
won rave reviews from experts for their performance and relatively 
low prices analysts say they are an important introduction in a 
segment of the computer business in which ibm never has done well 
we have postulated that ibm has only two ways out of its 
malaise it could either accept low growth and make massive 
cutbacks in expenses or it could get more aggressive in products 
and pricing martin wrote in a recent commentary 
he said the workstation announcement was a clear sign the 
company has chosen the latter path 
we think the newfound aggressiveness will improve investor 
psychology in the near term and should lead to substantial earnings 
improvements for the long term he wrote 
john jones an analyst for montgomery securities in san 
franciso said ibm also is benefiting from a share repurchase 
program announced last fall ibm said it would buy back up to 5 
billion worth of its shares during an unspecified time period 
share repurchase programs usually boost a companys stock price 
by reducing the supply of shares 
jones said in an interview that ibms restructuring which 
involves the elimination of 10000 jobs and consolidation of 
plants also has aided the companys performance 
ibm reported that its profit slipped 35 percent last year to 
376 billion or 647 a share from 581 billion 980 a share 
in 1988 revenue grew 51 percent to 627 billion from 597 
billion 
the reality is that 1989 when you adjust for nonrecurring 
events actually wasnt that bad a year for ibm jones said 
among the onetime charges against earnings was a pretax charge of 
24 billion for the restructuring in the fourth quarter 
he said ibms revenue and profit overseas where the company 
does more than half its business increased markedly last year but 
the impact to the bottom line was masked by an unfavorable dollar 
exchange rate 
he said the improved performance overseas in localcurrency 
terms says to the astute investor that the efforts ibm has been 
making for the last four years are starting to show 
in addition jones said ibms domestic revenue grew for the 
first time in four years though it only was a 2 percent increase 
jones said ibms share price is about where it was after the 
october 1987 market crash 
it is a battered stock that doesnt look like its got a lot 
of downside risk he said 
among the positive factors jones said is that growth in the 
technology industry this year should exceed the economy as a whole 
despite recent reports of retrenchment in the computer field 
an economic downturn could hurt ibm he said but it will have 
less of an impact if ibm has aggressively priced new technology in 
the marketplace 
stewart crane an analyst with gruntal amp co said ibm should 
outperform the technology industry as a whole 
but he added despite improvements theyre not working on 
all six cylinders 
its a general consensus that ibm stock is cheap enough on 
basic earnings power and probably wont have any major negative 
surprises he said 
he said ibms profit margins are being hurt by its decision to 
reduce the price of some of its products 
as for growth in ibms stock price this year jones predicts the 
bluechip issue could hit 120 to 130 a share while martin puts 
it at the high end of that range 
jones predicts ibms earnings per share should be about 10 this 
year matin puts the figure at 930 crane said the going estimate 
on wall street is about 950 a share

tom clancys hightech novel the hunt for 
red october enthralled millions of readers with its 
suspensefilled drama of a renegade soviet submarine surefire 
movie material right 
yet the saga took five years to reach the screen at least part 
of the reason observes producer mace neufeld is that studio 
executives dont read books 
the paramount pictures release starring sean connery alec 
baldwin and a mammoth sub named red october after the russian 
revolution reaches the nations theaters friday neufeld optioned 
the clancy book after reading the galley proofs in 1985 even 
though the book was a huge best seller the producers efforts to 
find a studio failed 
the cost factor was one reason he said in hollywood 
because of time constraints very few people in a position to say 
yes to a project like this read the book they generally read the 
readers report 
this book doesnt condense well into two or three pages i 
read some of the reports from the other studios and the story was 
too complicated to understand fortunately i was able to get a 
major executive at paramount to read the book and he said i 
think this can make a great movie lets see if we can develop it 
 
larry ferguson and donald stewart worked on the script and 
neufeld sought the cooperation of the us navy without that 
there could be no movie at first the submariners were reluctant 
pointing to their reputation as the silent service 
but many of the admirals were fans of the clancy book neufeld 
said and they concluded a film would be a good way of showing 
taxpayers where their money was going it helped that paramount 
had glamorized the navys jet fighters in top gun 
neufeld would admit only that the hunt for red october cost 
in excess of 30 million some estimates are as high as 50 
million much of the budget went to the navy which carries a list 
of charges for equipment and personnel used in movies 
the first actor signed for the large allmale cast was alec 
baldwin 
the picture was first mentioned to me in december of 1988 
the long islandborn actor recalled in an interview but it was 
not mentioned as the lead role i figured they would get mr big 
again 
that had happened to baldwin again and again he had played 
supporting roles in such films as beetlejuice married to the 
mob working girl talk radio and shes having a baby 
for some of the films i actually read for the lead roles he 
says it didnt work out that i got the roles 
i had been offered some leads in films that were less 
desirable to me and i turned them down i was lucky to be working 
with mike nichols woody allen jonathan demme and john hughes so 
i took the best that was offered to me at that time 
baldwin was joined by a strong cast including scott glenn james 
earl jones sam neill tim curry richard jordan and courtney b 
vance the key role of the soviet sub commander marko ramius went 
to the german actor klaus maria brandauer 
john mctiernan die hard was chosen as director he was two 
weeks into filming when disaster struck brandauer could not report 
because of another commitment the filmmakers sent a distress 
signal and a copy of the script by fax to sean connery 
i had reservations about it admits connery i thought 
this kind of cold war intrigue might be dated because of recent 
events it turned out that the studio had failed to fax the first 
page of the script which explained that it took place before 
gorbachev 
connery arrived in los angeles on a friday and was supposed to 
start shooting on monday he requested a days rehearsal then 
jumped into his role as the stolid soviet captain he managed with 
remarkable ease despite speaking his early dialogue in russian 
it wasnt hard he said they were all oneliners 
he also had to deal with the immensely complicated submarine 
hardware i cant even program my video recorder 
another hazard the submarine sets because filming aboard 
actual subs was impractical studio wizards constructed two 
50footsquare platforms to house mockups of the red october and 
the uss dallas they stood on top of two hydraulic gimbals that 
could simulate the subs movements 
it was very claustrophobic connery recalls there were 62 
people in a very confined space 45 feet above the stage floor it 
got very hot on the sets and im also prone to seasickness the 
set would tilt to 45 degrees very disturbing 
he was a navy man himself i enlisted at the age of 16 and 
rose to the august position of ablebodied seaman i enlisted for 
12 years but i was released after three because of ulcers which 
tells you something 
although he appears throughout the film connerys work was 
telescoped from seven weeks to four the production continued for 
months on locations from port angeles wash to the waters off los 
angeles that was the site of opening shots of the red october 
surfacing 
we had built a replica over 400 feet long says producer 
neufeld taking it out on the ocean was a scary moment for all of 
us we werent sure it would work happily it did 
paramount is taking no chances that the launch of the hunt for 
red october will go unnoticed the biggest movie hype since 
batman was launched with an ad on the super bowl telecast 
billboards in major cities have carried the teaser line the hunt 
is on that was followed by a poster with the films title and a 
stern portrait of sean connery 
millions of dollars have been poured into twopage ads in 
national magazines and commercials on national tv a gala premiere 
in washington was aimed to attract political attention 
and the entire campaign is keyed in flamecolored red and black

the 1990 audi v8 quattro is as close to a swagger as the folks 
at audi get 
this 47450 power machine is quietly packaged in decidedly audi 
styling the luxury eurosedan look thats relatively unassuming 
but take this new flagship of the audi fleet out on the highway 
and revel with audi in a new appreciation for what a luxury 
eurosedan can be 
the audi v8 quattro test cars 36liter 32valve v8 engine 
impressively dominated going from 0 to 60 mph in 87 seconds and 
is capable of producing 240 horsepower coupled with fourspeed 
electronically controlled automatic transmission it delivered 
smooth performance especially in the economy driving mode 
drivers can change the shift points with a knob on the center 
console depending on whether they want to watch fuel consumption 
economy mode or want maximum power sport setting i preferred 
the sport setting though it made this nearly 4000pound car so 
quick i nearly took off the corner bumpers of a couple of cars i 
was trying to pass 
and road handling the audi v8s suspension was masterful 
making the vehicle feel as safe and in control at lets just say 
frightfully high speeds as it did at the highway speed limit of 65 
mph and with fulltime fourwheeldrive this car can handle just 
about anything it tackled snow with gusto leaving other cars in a 
swirl of white it tracked capably through icy slush too 
it was especially impressive considering this is audis first 
merging of a powerful 32valve v8 engine an automatic 
transmission and permanent allwheeldrive technology of course 
its also the most expensive car the west german carmaker has 
marketed in the states the previous toppriced audi was the 200 
quattro wagon at 38000 
but wait theres more to the audi v8 quattro a microcomputer 
not only monitors the engine systems and maintains optimum 
performance but memorizes malfunctions for easier diagnosis at the 
shop 
the test cars antilock brakes abs came with a turnoff button 
on the dashboard for those driving conditions such as loose 
gravel where abs can sometimes hinder a drivers ability to stop 
by preventing gravel from building up at the wheels 
the audi bose sound system was superb and the electronically 
controlled front seats leather of course were roomy and 
comfortable the front center armrest which housed a cellular 
phone that was standard equipment not optional could be adjusted 
to various heights 
other thoughtful touches included heated seats in both the front 
and rear that worked wonderfully fast a heated door lock on the 
driver door so you cant be frozen out of the car and a dual 
windshield washer system the system lets you use a special washer 
fluid thats particularly effective for salt and grime first and 
then follow up with the regular fluid for pictureperfect vision no 
matter what the road throws up at you the headlights received a 
washing too each time the regular washer fluid was activated 
the front floor mats had fasteners to keep them in place 
carpeting was allwool throughout and the shoulder belt height was 
adjustable so the belt wouldnt chafe against a short persons neck 
there also was a reddish light that shone down on the driver 
floor area as an added safety feature when the headlights were on 
wood grain tastefully swathed across the doors and dashboard and a 
spot in the center of the instrument cluster that showed what radio 
station was tuned in so the driver never had to look below at the 
radio 
that feature took some getting used to my eyes caught the 
flickering of something changing in the instrument cluster and at 
first i thought it must have been a warning light that came on and 
went out on examination i realized it was just the changing radio 
station 
i also noted the car can guzzle down the fuel i averaged under 
17 mpg in combined cityhighway driving with the epa rating the 
audi v8 at 14 mpg in the city and 18 mpg on the highway a gas 
guzzler tax of 1050 by the way is added on to the 47450 base 
price for the audi v8 quattro because of the vehicles poor fuel 
economy 
additionally the person sitting in the rear middle seat would 
find the seatback a bit hard thats where the rear center armrest 
is and it just doesnt make for a very comfortable longterm 
resting spot on the other hand the rear legroom was good and 
both the rear window controls and rear cigarette lighter could be 
disabled with the touch of a button on the driver door so children 
in back cant get hurt 
audi lists some impressive competitors for the v8 quattro the 
mercedesbenz 420sel which starts around 63000 the bmw 735i 
around 53000 and the jaguar xj6 vanden plas around 48000 
audi didnt mention japanese luxury models such as the lexus 
ls400 which starts at 35000 but theyre bound to be a factor 
too 
still sales of the audi v8 quattro totaled more than 800 in 
calendar 1989 and the company projects about 1500 sales in 1990 
theyre looking for mostly male buyers between 35 and 49 with 
household income of 150000 they will be predominantly college 
graduates in professional jobs audi said 
because the audi v8 quattro is a new vehicle consumer reports 
magazine does not list owner trouble reports

drexel burnham lambert incs disclosure that it 
paid more than 200 million in bonuses before collapsing has 
angered creditors and reinforced a popular notion that the junk 
bond giant was a glutton to the end 
but compensation experts say the magnitude and timing of the 
drexel bonuses which came to light this past week dont 
necessarily show a lastminute money orgy by a company that came to 
symbolize the greedy excesses of the past decade 
many said these bonuses an alien dream to most american workers 
but a standard practice on wall street graphically illustrate the 
nature of the skewed pay system in the feastorfamine securities 
business where the best talent has come to expect annual rewards 
of six figures and often more 
what i think has happened to many firms is theyve built these 
bonuses into their cost structure said richard furniss a vice 
president and compensation consultant at towers perrin forster amp 
crosby in manhattan 
thats why you get a situation like drexel which feels 
perfectly justified to pay the bonuses he said its an 
extreme result of the compensation system 
drexel pioneered the 200 billion junk bond market financed the 
1980s takeover decade and became known as the brashest most 
arrogant and profitable firm on wall street 
it collapsed with startling speed feb 13 the result of a slump 
in junk bonds a criminal plea bargain on fraud charges a cash 
shortage and a stunning loss of confidence by banks lenders and 
customers drexels parent filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection with debts totaling nearly 3 billion 
in those circumstances the disclosure that drexel paid yearend 
bonuses in the hundreds of millions of dollars only a few months 
before seemed even more stunning 
it raised questions about whether management knew how severe the 
firms problems were or whether the money was paid deliberately to 
keep creditors from getting any some drexel critics even theorized 
that if the company hadnt paid the bonuses it might have survived 
drexel denied initial reports that the bonuses totaled as much 
as 350 million and said the payments were predetermined by a 
formula devised a year ago on friday it issued a more detailed 
response saying the bonuses totaled only 260 million about 25 
percent of it paid in company stock thats now almost worthless 
nonetheless the propriety of the bonuses is expected to become 
an issue in bankruptcy court and in congressional scrutiny of the 
drexel collapse 
historically bonuses have represented the overwhelming portion 
of a wall street professionals annual compensation many 
investment firms are structured as partnerships in which employees 
draw a living allowance during most of the year calculate their 
pool of profit toward yearend and divvy it up 
those profit pools began to multiply in the late 1970s and grew 
even more dramatically in the 1980s fueled by enormous expansion 
in the financial markets and the role investment banks played in 
corporate takeovers 
wall street compensation packages are a result of the 
industrys incredibly accelerated growth rate during the boom 
years when they were really engaged in a bidding war for a scarce 
commodity talent said pearl meyer head of pearl meyer amp 
partners a new york compensation consulting firm 
the firms became extremely profitable compensation spiraled 
year after year she said some tried to keep it down but 
werent successful because everyone was recruiting 
in those circumstances an investment banker who historically 
brought in millions of dollars in business would simply jump ship 
if an employer tried to limit the bonus 
even in the midst of the slump that has gripped the securities 
industry for more than two years the bonus often has remained 
entrenched many firms have laid off thousands of workers and 
exited marginally profitable businesses to cut their costs instead 
vincent c perro a principal at sibson amp co a new york 
management consulting firm said a third alternative that some wall 
street firms are trying is to base bonuses more on an individuals 
contribution 
given the reduced ability to pay firms are differentiating 
between strong average and weak performers more sharply in the 
past he said 
others said they expected this disparity to grow and were 
advising clients to restructure their their bonus systems so that 
stars get rewarded and laggards dont 
you examine individual performance more closely so you know 
where the money is made and you know whos making it said 
furniss 
elsewhere in business this past week 
the auto industry showed more signs of weakness major 
automakers said midfebruary sales fell 121 percent the big three 
proceeded with previously announced layoff plans that will idle 
thousands of workers jaguar plc the troubled british automaker 
dogged by quality control problems issued a major recall in the 
midst of its acquisition by ford motor co in europe volvo and 
renault said they would invest in each other to make them more 
competitive 
despite one of the worst weeks ever for the tokyo stock market 
stocks in the united states suffered only slightly the divergent 
behavior conflicted with the widespread notion that the 
economically mighty japanese have become the dominant force in 
influencing markets elsewhere 
in one of the few big takeovers so far this year great 
northern nekoosa corp dropped its resistance to a 37 billion 
acquisition by rival georgia pacific corp the merger will create 
the largest us forest products company 
the federal government blasted smoking but sanctioned a fat 
substitute health and human services secretary louis sullivan 
intensifying a campaign against tobacco companies urged athletes 
to shun their blood money sponsorships meanwhile the food and 
drug administration approved the first fat substitute a concoction 
of egg whites and milk called simplesse made by monsanto co

there may indeed be a peace dividend in the 
future but it might not be the one thats getting most of the 
attention 
most of the dividend talk so far has centered around the 
possibility of the the country having to spend less for defense in 
a more peaceful world allowing deficits to be cut or money 
allocated to various social needs 
more recent thinking takes another perspective on the peace 
dividend one that envisions the united states and in fact the 
entire world benefitting from a marked increase in trade and 
economic development 
the latter thesis is beginning to sound more likely for many 
reasons most compelling of them being that it probably has begun 
already 
even before the socialist wall crumbled american companies were 
preparing for a relaxation of business restrictions throughout 
eastern europe now that matters have been facilitated a rush is 
on to develop markets there 
western money markets already reflect an eagerness to begin the 
financing job which federal reserve chairman alan greenspan last 
week called the most important financial issue of the decade 
greenspans comments were timely since eastern europes great 
need for investment capital representing a brand new demand on the 
worlds lendable funds already have pushed up us and world 
interest rates 
in testimony before the senate banking committee greenspan 
indicated that the higher rates might be temporary and many 
financial analysts continue to believe that interest costs in 
general will resume falling later this year 
his comments were also significant because until now the usual 
explanation for high interest rates often shared by the fed was 
the existence of federal budget deficits those deficits now fall 
to second place 
if the united states is able to take advantage of the big 
demands likely to be made by the emerging market economies of 
europe it would help at least in the short term to reduce the 
nagging us balance of payments deficit 
the expansion of market economies especially if it eventually 
includes china would also provide relief from intense competition 
for severely stressed domestic goods producers now pressured by 
imports from europe and asia 
the possibilities for trade expansion are heightened also by 
events beyond eastern europe the japanese are expected to relax 
restrictions to entry into their markets and the planned economic 
unification of western europe might spur growth in that area 
further enhancing possibilities for us companies 
the original notion of a peace dividend was that savings would 
come mainly from a reduction in defense spending with estimates 
ranging from a few billion dollars to as much as 150 billion a 
year 
such a decline would open up various options to american 
policymakers including tax cuts elimination of the big budget 
deficits and attacks on various social problems including drugs 
poor housing and health care 
if the budget deficit shrinks and if the federal reserve could 
fine tune the money supply it becomes conceivable in such a 
scenario that interest rates and inflation would decline giving a 
big boost to the standard of living 
in the past however such apparent opportunities have a 
mysterious way of disappearing when the money is counted somehow 
planned savings get spent sometimes unwisely the only explanation 
being that thats politics 
the peace dividend that arises from investment and industrial 
development is very real and it probably is under way right now

events this week on wall street once again 
demonstrated the link between the japanese and american stock 
markets or did they 
twice this past week the key index on the tokyo stock exchange 
plunged each time the drop echoed in new york but the severity 
of the decline on wall street didnt come close to the fall in 
tokyo 
on wednesday when the nikkei index fell 315 percent for its 
thirdworst decline ever stocks in new york mimicked the slide at 
the opening bell and the dow jones industrial average plummeted 30 
points 
but the market soon recovered and by the close the dow was 
down a modest 1329 
on friday the nikkei fell 261 percent for its fifthworst drop 
in history again the new york market opened lower but the dow 
was down only about 11 points the market seesawed before the dow 
finished down 1058 
the behavior of the two markets cast doubt on what widely had 
been assumed to be the inextricable link between the us and 
japanese exchanges 
that relationship was demonstrated powerfully last oct 13 when 
the dow plunged 190 points but the tokyo stock markets strength in 
the following session helped restore investor confidence on wall 
street 
at the time many had feared the tokyo market would plunge and 
drag down new york even further particularly if japanese investors 
were forced to sell their us stocks to raise cash for obligations 
at home many american securities holders worried about that 
prospect again this past week 
walter murphy a senior market specialist with merrill lynch amp 
co inc said the new york and tokyo markets react to domestic 
issues as much as to events abroad 
youre looking at two markets that are acting under their own 
reasons for being he said 
for example he said when the yen is down in relation to the 
dollar its bad news for the tokyo market but good news in new 
york because a weaker yen helps improve us trade competitiveness 
however he did not dispute that there was a link among the 
world markets 
if you look at markets over time there is and has been a good 
global relationship bull markets in one part of the world are 
going to be bull markets in the other part of the world he said 
but he added to say there is a daytoday correlation is not 
only inaccurate but probably dangerous 
ralph e blair a partner in the trading department of 
montgomery securities inc in san francisco said there 
certainly is a concern about what goes on over there but 
considering all the bad economic news the us market is 
acting pretty well 
blair said one factor that made it easier for the us markets 
to take the japanese plunge in stride this week was that the 
decline was fairly orderly as far as market drops go 
in addition analysts have been saying for months that the tokyo 
market the worlds largest and richest was overpriced and ripe 
for a correction they said its share prices were way out of 
line with corporate earnings 
some experts say the tokyo market operates in a world of its 
own european stocks historically have moved more in tandem with 
new york than with tokyo that also may account for a lessening of 
the impact of a drop in japan 
the reaction in new york also may have been another 
demonstration of wall streets stiff upper lip so far this year in 
the face of gloomy economic news the market has shrugged off 
concern about higher interest rates recession forecasts and the 
demise of drexel burnham lambert inc 
for the week which was shortened a day by the presidents day 
holiday the dow jones average of 30 industrials lost 7140 to 
256419 
the new york stock exchange composite index slipped 440 to 
17935 the nasdaq composite index of overthecounter trading lost 
949 to 41952 and the american stock exchange market value index 
dropped 777 to 35110

bowing to the growing significance of the 
social and public policy issues involving tobacco products 
federal securities regulators say philip morris cos cannot block 
shareholder antismoking resolutions 
the securities and exchange commission informed philip morris on 
thursday that it was reversing its stance allowing the company to 
reject such proposals as interference with its ordinary course of 
business 
companies seeking to exclude attempts to put issues up for a 
vote at annual shareholders meetings must seek sec approval in the 
form of a staff letter saying the agency will take no action 
against the company for barring such a proposal 
while prior staff letters have permitted exclusion of 
shareholder proposals limiting involvement in tobacco products on 
the grounds of ordinary business interference the staff believes 
that many of these positions should be reversed sec special 
counsel john c brousseau wrote philip morris 
he added those prior letters failed to reflect adequately the 
growing significance of the social and public policy issues 
attendant to operations involving the manufacture and distribution 
of tobacco related products 
his letter concerned a resolution proposed for the annual 
meeting on april 26 by two roman catholic religious orders the 
province of st joseph of the capuchin order and the adrian 
dominican sisters the proposal calls for amending the articles of 
incorporation to bar philip morris after dec 31 1991 from 
conducting any business in tobacco or tobacco products 
also allowed by the sec was a proposal by the evangelical 
lutheran church in america to create a review committee to study 
the impact of philip morris advertising on smoking by minors
