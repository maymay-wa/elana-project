for days lee barr sr has seen 
occasional falling snow when he looks out his window in the 
northwest alaska village of kiana in a couple of weeks he said 
the kobuk river will be ice 
its hard for him to imagine what his serviceman son marvin is 
experiencing in the hot desert of saudi arabia 
hes doing good so far he says hes getting used to it 
barr said of the 21yearold marine one of several alaska eskimos 
stationed in saudi arabia 
marvins first letter home arrived recently he said he missed 
his mothers baking and native food his father laughs at the 
thought of smoked salmon and dried caribou meat in saudi arabia 
he said it was kind of warm and it must have been hot down 
there if he says warm his father said in a telephone interview 
when he talks about something he cant make things sound bad 
hes always been like that 
marvin is one of lee and viola barrs eight children and has 
been a marine for nearly four years he has been in saudi arabia 
for about a month 
it was kind of hard at first i guess said his father 
the heat and wondering what they were going to do whether they 
were going to have action 
its kind of hard for us too wondering 
lee barr hopes his son and all american military personnel will 
come home soon he doesnt think they should be in saudi arabia to 
begin with 
its just for the money he said of the american military 
presence in the persian gulf theres a lot of other things that 
need to be done the people that are starving people who are sick 
those things we just ignore and were getting into somebodys 
business 
the barrs neighbors lorenze and nellie schuerch have two sons 
in the marines but neither has gone to saudi arabia yet 
one of them 20yearold vincent is home on leave for 20 days 
from his base at camp pendleton calif 
vincent schuerch said hes has been hunting and helping out 
around home but is ready to go back when needed hed like to see 
saudi arabia 
if the opportunity came to see a different country yes i 
would like to go he said just to say ive been down there 
his mother supports the us action in the middle east but hopes 
things settle down before her boys are sent over 
my concern is the possibility of chemical warfare she told 
the arctic sounder newspaper in kotzebue 
if that doesnt happen we still have that heat in saudi 
arabia living in the arctic all of their lives and then going to 
120degree saudi arabia heat i dont know how anybody can adjust 
to that i dont know how an eskimo can adjust to that

more than 200 bishops from around the world 
gather in rome this weekend for a synod expected to consider the 
issue of sex and the roman catholic priesthood 
pope john paul ii called the assembly of 238 bishops to discuss 
the formation of priests in todays world an advisory body it 
will make recommendations to him at the end of the monthlong 
meeting which starts sunday 
the churchs rules that priests be celibate and foresake 
marriage are not expected to be subjects up for debate according 
to church sources involved in preparations for the meeting john 
paul has shown no indications the rules might be changed under his 
papacy 
but a major concern of the bishops is finding and training 
candidates able to live up to the priestly vows of poverty 
chastity and obedience 
several sexual scandals involving churchmen have made headlines 
in recent months 
the archbishop of atlanta eugene a marino resigned july 10 
after revelations of a twoyear intimate relationship with a 
young woman singer and lay minister 
a report in july by a churchappointed commission in 
newfoundland said priests had sexually abused boys in the canadian 
province for more than a decade and that the church had failed to 
stop it the archbishop alphonsus penney accepted responsibility 
and offered his resignation to the pope 
such inhouse problems are usually handled with great discretion 
by the vatican it has never commented publicly on the marino case 
announcing only that he resigned for reasons of health 
but the vatican has issued several documents this year 
expressing concern over the qualifications of candidates for the 
priesthood particularly at a time when the church is trying to 
increase the number of priests and nuns 
the paper bluntly declared that aspiring priests and nuns must 
overcome sexual desires that would break their vows of chastity 
it said those unable to overcome their homosexual tendencies or 
who maintain it is possible to adopt a third way living in an 
ambiguous state between celibacy and marriage must be dismissed 
from religious life 
and it suggested that psychological testing can be useful in 
determining sexual problems in candidates 
i dont think anyone would say it was easy to be celibate 
said the rev howard bleichner director of the department for 
priestly formation of the national conference of catholic bishops 
in washington dc 
but he said the highly publicized failures of priests did not 
reflect a problem with the nature of the priesthood 
if a prominent man is unfaithful in marriage i wouldnt take 
that as a reason to rethink the institution of marriage 
bleichner said 
while the number of worldwide ordinations has been growing after 
hitting a decade low in 1979 the numbers are still down in the 
united states and western europe 
bleichner said students in the past four years of us seminary 
numbered 3698 this year compared with 7855 in 1968 
the question in our society is of longterm commitment 
examples of that are becoming increasingly rare look at the 
breakup of marriages 
a 1988 report by the us bishops found that many of the 
nations priests were overworked lonely and sexually troubled it 
contended that the mandatory celibacy is a major reason why priests 
leave 
the american bishops bleichner said are looking forward to 
hearing the experiences on priestly training from other countries 
there are clearly great differences in experiences from country 
to country brought home by two bishops attending a vatican news 
conference on the synod 
cardinal lucas moreira neves of sao salvador da bahia brazil 
lamented the frightening lack of priests in his diocese noting 
there were 340 to serve the 3 million people 
bishop henryk myzinski of wloclawek in the popes native poland 
said he had 590 priests for 11 million faithful 
the us bishops will be represented by cardinal joseph 
bernardin of chicago cardinal james hickey of washington dc 
archbishop daniel pilarczyk of cincinnati and bishop john marshall 
of burlington vt who headed a study of us seminaries in the 
early 80s 
the pope who appoints 15 percent of the delegates named bishop 
harry flynn of lafayette la bishop robert brom of san diego and 
bishop donald wuerl of pittsburgh all former seminary rectors

good guidance limited personal 
contact and no booze whatever the reasons american troops are on 
their best behavior in saudi arabia and the locals are impressed 
in the eight weeks since the first us military forces were 
deployed in operation desert shield officials said there have been 
no reported criminal incidents and no serious insults to saudi 
culture things that american and saudi officials had most feared 
despite the presence of more than 150000 foreigners most of 
them armed only one saudi is reported to have died in an armed 
forcesrelated incident a man killed sept 25 when his taxi 
collided with a marine corps pickup the accident is under 
investigation 
from top generals to gis americans say they have found the 
saudis to be friendly hospitable and tolerant of ignorance about 
their desert kingdom and its traditions 
for their part numerous saudis say the american soldiers appear 
to have been well advised on what to expect and how to behave 
theyre strangers in a strange land they know it and they 
act like it said a saudi who has a western perspective from 
several years of living abroad 
some of them seem even overly sensitive in the briefings 
theyre told not to say things like hey dude because dude is 
arabic for worm but i doubt whether many saudis would even 
understand what they meant 
us commander gen h norman schwarzkopf said in a recent 
interview that he encounters every day a new aspect of 
cultural differences and tries to work with the saudis to 
figure out a commonsense intelligent way to solve problems 
one area of concern is the mailing of packages containing 
alcohol religious articles and other materials prohibited by saudi 
law 
but even fears about this have proved generally groundless us 
officials say 
a heck showed only three minor incidents in which saudi customs 
officials seized a jar of whiskey a bottle of vodka and three 
copies of playboy magazine said a us spokesman navy cmdr david 
knox 
another serviceman was investigated after his wife sent a 
package with three bottles of liquor but no charges were filed 
americans and some saudis say the absence of alcohol is 
probably a major factor in explaining the troops exemplary 
behavior 
theres no randr in the saudi cities no way for them to 
raise hell said the former saudi expatriate when that doesnt 
go on you dont have the things that create resentment 
there have been some incidents of misunderstanding or affronts 
to the saudis but very few involving religion the most sensitive 
aspect of saudi culture 
iraqi president saddam hussein and jordans king hussein have 
sought in speeches to persuade moslems that american troops are 
defiling islams holiest shrines at mecca and medina which 
nonmoslems are not allowed to visit 
saudi leaders scoff at the claim 
the foreigners are 1000 miles from the holy places said a 
saudi diplomatic source if anything king hussein needs a crash 
course in saudi geography 
a saudi prince who also spoke on condition of anonymity said he 
hoped the presence of americans will lead to us understanding 
each other better 
that has not always been easy 
when american civilians in the dhahran area put on an amateur 
stage show for the troops it lasted only one performance 
the saudis complained that female performers showed too much 
leg privately they were said to hve felt that television 
coverage flaunted the event in their faces 
saudi citizens also complained to prince mohammed bin fahd 
governor of the eastern province and son of king fahd about us 
troops carrying their m16 rifles in the streets of dhahran and 
nearby khobar 
us military officials quickly expressed regrets and said they 
would brief troops again on weapons decorum 
there were reports too that some saudi women were upset over 
the presence of american women in uniform fearing they were here 
to steal their men 
that was just womens gossip said the saudi who has lived 
abroad the educated people have been pleasantly surprised by the 
conduct of the americans 
the thing thats impressed our people most is how polite they 
are these are pretty young kids i almost feel sorry for them 
being so patient and saying thank you all the time

editors note this report is one of a series on the german 
countdown to unity on oct 3 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
as germany rushes toward 
unification it is also becoming the promised land for tens of 
thousands of people swarming into the country to escape poverty in 
the third world and eastern europe 
the influx is further strapping west germany already 
hardpressed to come up with the tens of billions of dollars needed 
to rescue east germany from economic catastrophe 
german unification which will formally take place wednesday 
appears to have given a boost to the pace of arrivals authorities 
expect a record number of 200000 political asylumseekers this 
year last year the figure stood at 120000 
last year west germany became the new home for 350000 ethnic 
german immigrants from eastern europe about 500000 east germans 
resettled across the border in 1989 and in the early months of 
1990 
authorities are aware that many refugees are seeking a brighter 
economic future even if they say they are fleeing political 
persecution 
they are trying to stem the tide but it wont be easy 
all they have to do to stay here is make it believable that 
they are foreign and that they are politically persecuted said 
volker moeser who runs a government reception center just outside 
frankfurt for seekers of political asylum 
the center in schwalbach is housing about 850 refugees and 
dozens of 12bed tents have been put up to deal with the influx 
the opening of east european borders has contributed 
dramatically to the increase 
once registered asylum applicants settle down to wait until 
authorities decide whether to recognize them as political refugees 
a process that can take five years only about 3 percent receive 
refugee status but the statistics dont seem to be a deterrent 
at the schwalbach camps cafeteria poles and romanians mingled 
with turks ghanaians pakistanis somalis afghanis and a variety 
of other nationals as they lined up to buy cheap lunch 
outside a tent a romanian gypsy family of 13 enjoyed a recent 
sunny day by relaxing on a blanket the head of the clan its only 
male made a few declarations of support for the new romanian 
authorities and claims of past persecution by securitate secret 
police 
then he talked about why he really brought the family to 
germany 
one day they closed the factory and i lost my job there is no 
future in romania said the man who gave his name only as 
novakovic and said he was from timisoara 
in the latest twist west germany suddenly faces the prospect of 
soviet deserters as well officials have expressed fears that many 
of the 360000 soviet soldiers stationed in east germany may ask 
for asylum rather than return to a bleak future in their homeland 
as the troops are pulled out under german unification agreements 
eight soviet soldiers deserted in august and 26 more applied for 
asylum in the central hesse state in recent weeks some coming over 
with their wives 
also bonn officials have temporarily halted the immigration of 
soviet jews in order to prevent a virtual stampede the west german 
consulate in kiev alone has received 10000 applications 
the rush of new arrivals from all over is stretching social 
services to the limit communities have been refusing to accept the 
refugees because they lack housing or even sending them to east 
germany 
but east germany itself still has to persuade 80000 workers 
from vietnam cuba and mozambique to return home citizens of east 
bloc countries once had free access to east germany but visa 
requirements have been tightened 
in some third world countries newspapers carry advertisements 
touting the advantages of seeking political asylum in west germany 
the ads are placed by rings that then organize the trips for a 
hefty fee 
some officials think that only legitimate asylumseekers should 
be allowed to cross the borders they also want the paperwork 
speeded up and those refused asylum to be expelled immediately 
the federal governments blueprint calls for aid at the source 
under the proposal germany would help build housing and create 
jobs in poor countries in an attempt to keep potential 
asylumseekers from leaving 
we want a larger germany to remain friendly to foreigners 
said interior minister wolfgang schaeuble

ms sandys daughter of churchills eldest daughter diane was 
on hand thursday to watch as construction crews used a crane to 
lower slabs of the wall near a statue of her grandfather 
sandys a new york sculptor said she wanted the work at 
westminster because it was here that churchill gave the speech that 
outlined the developing cold war era of eastwest conflict that 
started after world war ii and ended last year 
i feel the wall is really the physical embodiment of the iron 
curtain she said im really pleased to have it here its 
really a perfect fit the whole thing 
first and foremost its a piece of art but also its a 
political statement she said sometimes they intertwine 
churchill came to fulton on march 5 1946 with president 
truman in his speech at westminster he warned of new problems 
facing the world after the allied victory in world war ii 
in the bestknown passage he said a shadow has fallen upon 
the scene so lately lighted by allied victory from stettin 
in the baltic to trieste in the adriatic an iron curtain has 
descended across the continent 
the 10foothigh sculpture has sections cut out in the shape of 
a man and woman through which people can walk one side is covered 
with graffiti left by west berliners after the wall went up in 
1962 
after ms sandys approached east german officials in february 
about her idea for the sculpture they allowed her to survey the 
wall and choose the sections she wanted those she took had been in 
an area frequented by artists she said 
i chose these sections out of 200 she said because i 
thought the colors of the graffiti were dynamic and lovely

on a tip that terrorists with iraqi connections had entered the 
united states raided a churchoperated shelter for central american 
immigrants thursday 
immigration officials previously had maintained a handsoff 
policy toward casa romero operated by the roman catholic diocese 
of brownsville because it is considered a church thirtyfive 
people were arrested 
silvestre reyes chief patrol agent with the us border 
patrols mcallen sector said immigration officials obtained the 
search warrant after learning that there might be 21 indians 
pakistanis and iranians there he said officials particularly were 
interested in finding individuals from the sikh religious sect of 
india 
we have some information regarding national security regarding 
those individuals reyes said 
five indians two pakistanis four guyanese two salvadorans 
six hondurans a guatemalan and 15 who said they were mexican were 
arrested at casa romero for allegedly being in the country 
illegally reyes said 
reyes said officials believe some of those identifying

jim swire is a country doctor whose 
days and evenings are devoted to his patients 
his nights belong to his obsession airport security and the 
bombing of pan am flight 103 which killed his daughter flora 
why oh why flora 
swire wrote that on his briefcase around a circular photograph 
of his firstborn in frequent meetings with government officials 
he makes sure they see it 
you can see their hackles rising when they see a person 
theyve allowed to be killed i dont see why they shouldnt see 
it said the softspoken grayhaired physician 
flora swire a happy medical student a gifted artist and 
musician was traveling to the united states to spend christmas 
with her american boyfriend she was one of 270 people who died 
when the plane blew up at 704 pm on dec 21 1988 and rained 
wreckage on the scottish town of lockerbie 
it was the day before her 24th birthday 
in the 21 months since then her father has had periods of 
intense depression and rage but his campaign to point out security 
flaws bring the terrorists to justice and reform british airport 
security has been relentless 
on monday swire will be in dumfries 10 miles west of 
lockerbie for the opening of a public scottish inquiry into 
accident 
rage is my secret weapon when i am sitting at this desk its 
2 am and i have another letter to write but i want to go to bed 
i just think about that flight that warm airplane at four minutes 
past 7 and it makes me so angry that the adrenalin starts going 
and i can last for a few more hours he said 
the desk is swires communications center a large computer fax 
machine and desk telephone to supplement a mobile phone tucked in 
the breast pocket of his gray suit 
there are many photographs of flora smiling with alert 
playful eyes in the swires sandstone house overlooking the 
malvern hills of central england 
a son william is taking a year off before college catherine 
who saw her sister off at heathrow airport still lives at home 
she was excited about floras trip and even thought about 
buying a ticket too swire said he took a deep breath fighting 
to keep the voice steady 
i came within a hairs breadth of losing both of them 
the swires keep a comfortable house where the burmese cat has 
free rein over the oriental rugs the dogs long tail slaps against 
antiques and dinner in the kitchen is beef stew and homegrown 
fruit 
but talk around the table is about mohammad abu talb the 
palestinian terrorist serving a life sentence in sweden for 
bombings against american and israeli targets in europe lockerbie 
investigators have identified talb as a suspect 
a telephone call from a swedish journalist takes swire from the 
table 
a doctors family is used to being interrupted at the dinner 
table but this is just unbelievable said jane swire her voice 
trailing off her eyes cast down 
the inquiry beginning monday the scottish version of an 
inquest is not the wideranging investigation that swire has been 
demanding but he intends to spend as much of the opening week in 
dumfries as his practice allows he hopes to testify 
i am a thorn in the flesh of the british government thorns 
fester and i am determined not to leave off until we have some 
answers he said 
swire wants to know why department of transport warnings about a 
cassette recorder bomb like the one that blew up flight 103 reached 
airport security staff after his daughter was dead 
why was a warning of a terrorist threat given to us embassy 
staff in helsinki and other cities but not to the public 
why has the british government refused an independent inquiry 
even after a us presidential commission reported in may that the 
disaster could have been prevented 
there were 259 passengers on the flight including 31 british 
citizens as spokesman for uk families flight 103 swire 
frequently travels to the united states for meetings with the two 
active family groups there 
in may he risked arrest by flying to new york with a fake bomb 
in his suitcase to dramatize his belief that airport security is 
still too lax 
swire 54 learned about explosives during army service in the 
royal engineers he says it took him six hours to buy the parts and 
duplicate the terrorists bomb substituting marzipan for semtex 
the czechoslovakianmade plastic explosive 
when i smuggled the bomb on the flight to new york and we 
flew up over scotland and climbed to 31000 feet it was a strange 
sensation that the other passengers didnt have a clue that there 
was a fake bomb in the hold 
swires record for interviews is 24 in one day and his news 
conferences are as wellrun as any politicians 
a scholarship in floras memory has been established at 
nottingham university but the young woman may be most vividly 
remembered in the dark circles under her fathers eyes a sign of 
his determination 
swire said he has matured from initially wanting vengeance and 
having people fired to a desire for improved airport security to 
prevent another disaster he admits the goal is distant 
swire said his initial rage was stoked by officials who treated 
him as an ignorant outsider 
it made me livid he said i had seen dead bodies lying in 
pieces in a mausoleum in lockerbie the experts didnt know what 
the death of 270 people looks like and they never would thats why 
they can forget it and have such a lackadaisical approach to 
security 
the swires traveled to lockerbie a few days after the disaster 
families were told they could not see the bodies because it 
would be too upsetting a policy swire says goes against 
psychological practices 
being a doc i pulled some strings and the pathologist put my 
daughters body aside for me swire said 
there were flowers around her body in the makeshift mortuary 
and the pathologist had clipped a lock of floras thick black hair 
to give to the father 
my mind was blank and i half expected to feel rage swire 
said but i just felt waves of sadness passing over me wave 
after wave a flying carpet of sadness 
the swires at first worked out their grief on their 16 acres of 
pasture land planting 4500 trees 
i was so sort of shellshocked he said i began planting 
the trees it was a mindless job but it kept me busy just 
digging a hole putting the tree in and tamping it down

otto von bismarck became a hero when he 
unified germany through blood and iron as germany merges 
peacefully he takes on renewed importance for a generation seeking 
to draw lessons from the past 
tens of thousands of germans including political leaders have 
flocked to a major exhibit in west berlin attempting to analyze 
bismarck and the consequences of his policies for germany and for 
europe 
the german historical museums exhibit bismarck prussia 
germany and europe was planned three years ago when the 
question of unity seemed a distant dream to most germans 
nobody could have known three years ago how current the 
bismarck topic would be by the summer of 1990 says christoph 
stoelzl director of the german historical museum 
the impact of german unity next wednesday has preoccupied 
todays politicians diplomats financiers and historians much as 
it did when bismarck united the country the first time in 1871 
some europeans have expressed concern the new germany will be 
too big and too powerful and more interested in itself than in 
european unity again there is a parallel to the bismarck era 
because those same problems developed after 1871 
it is important to think about what the concept of nationhood 
means because of what is happening in germany but also in the 
framework of european unity said bernard falge director of the 
french intitute in west berlin the institute has set up two 
academic conferences on the topic 
the bismarck exhibit has already attracted leading politicians 
since it opened aug 26 west german president richard von 
weizsaecker social democratic chairman hansjochen vogel and his 
east german counterpart wolfgang thierse are among more than 
50000 people who have seen it the exhibit runs until nov 25 
it is hard to ignore bismarck in germany many towns have a 
bismarck street there have been bismarck submarines and ships 
there are hundreds of books devoted to the statesman known as the 
iron chancellor 
nearly 300 institutions in more than a dozen countries lent 
paintings sculptures letters books uniforms maps and other 
items to form the biggest collection of objects connected with 
bismarck ever assembled 
it is rather overwhelming to go see so many things from that 
time said manfred jehle a researcher at the historical 
commission in west berlin after he saw the exhibit for the first 
time 
the first part of the exhibit concentrates on the powerful 
region of prussia named for an exterminated pagan tribe bismarck 
a native prussian set german unity as one of his major goals when 
he became prime minister of prussia in 1862 
but he looked down on a peaceful way to uniting germanys 
principalities duchies kingdoms and states which were 
constantly being overrun by the french or the austrians because of 
their lack of unity 
the great questions of the time will not be decided by 
speeches and majority decisions but through iron and blood 
bismarck said in one of his most famous speeches in 1862 
the exhibit follows through prussian battles in the 1860s to the 
francoprussian war and the 1871 proclamation of a constitutional 
monarchy and a unified germany 
this time germans are unifying after four decades of living 
with the legacy of the countrys nazi past and in contrast to 
bismarck current chancellor helmut kohl got what he wanted in 
large part through skillful and patient diplomacy 
this time the united germany will combine the 11 west german 
states with five new states being reorganized in east germany much 
of bismarcks prussia now lies in the soviet union and poland 
following nazi germanys loss in world war ii 
the exhibit also focuses on bismarcks policy toward europe 
which was based on isolating france and building up an army 
powerful enough to defeat the enemy several of bismarcks spiked 
helmets form part of an extensive display of german military dress 
his strategy drove europe apart and led to the glorification of 
the military which continued through the world wars that defeated 
and then divided germany 
kohl however espouses west germanys postwar proeuropean 
policies and is committed to european unification kohl the next 
chancellor of a unified germany has promised to maintain that 
policy rather than take bismarcks militaristic path

until the showers arrive 
the m12 decontamination unit is the favorite spot at this marine 
camp in the northern saudi desert 
the unit is supposed to be used to wash troops free of chemical 
weapons or any other dangerous substances they come in contact with 
in the field 
but for now its also doubling as the shower 
everyone follows the same routine two minutes of water followed 
by one minute to lather up followed by two minutes of water to 
rinse 
or as capt adrian burke of deer park texas puts it 
you wet down wash up rinse off and dry up and youre good to 
go for another day 
you have to spend some time in the saudi desert where the 
powdery sand clings to everything and everyone to appreciate such 
niceties 
a fourminute shower might not seem like much but out here 
its the highlight of the day burke said during a recent visit 
to the camp named after world war ii marine ace joe foss

no matter where a soldier goes there are constants such as 
military food 
when there are no other meals available the troops get 
modernday crations known today as meals ready to eat theyre 
3000 calories with the choice ranging from chicken a la king to 
beef stew uffice it to say theyre not too tasty 
anyone who can eat an mre ought to be able to take a hill 
marine commandant gen alfred gray told a group of marines during a 
visit to their camp wednesday 
these men had just had a treat a hot breakfast in the desert 
including what several men said was their first cup of hot coffee 
since they arrived in saudi arabia five weeks ago 
but the breakfast menu had a familiar chowhall ring creamed

the air force is keeping its f117 stealth fighterbomber away 
from reporters but not because they dont want to show it off 
the stealth was deployed to the region more than a month ago and 
air force spokesmen soon after began taking names of reporters and 
photographers who wanted to see the radareluding aircraft and 
interview its pilots 
but those plans are now on hold because of objections raised by 
the saudi government according to miliary sources 
the stealth is considered an offensive weapon and the american 
deployment in saudi arabia is described as a defensive mission 
the saudis are worried it would send the wrong signals one 
of the military sources said

prabhat aggarwal knows by his very name 
his place in life aggarwal is also his caste 
aggarwals were the masters of the economy in india kings and 
rajas were dependent on us we were the moneylenders the 
17yearold student said 
aggarwal whose caste puts him in the upper rank of indian 
society was on a downtown street demonstrating against prime 
minister vp singhs policy to reserve more government jobs for 
lowcaste indians 
singh described the policy as a glimmer of hope to those who 
have known only oppression for centuries because of their caste 
he said wednesday he would rather quit than barter away the 
aspirations of the deprived 
uppercaste students angered and feeling threatened that jobs 
historically dominated by their classes would be reserved for the 
lower castes have rioted across northern india crippling new 
delhi for several days this week 
on sept 19 a 20yearold uppercaste student rajeev goswami 
doused himself with gasoline and lit a match goswami survived but 
seven other students and a farmer have committed suicide and 
dozens have tried fortysix have died in clashes with police 
which prompted officials thursday to declare curfews in eight 
cities 
we love mother india aggarwal complained but when a 
mother says one child is good and the other is bad what can we 
do 
the uppercaste feel tremendous pressure from their families to 
succeed and the threat of losing jobs to people who are 
lessqualified is driving them to desperate acts said ashis nandi 
of the center for the study of developing societies 
critics say the timing and manner of announcing the policy made 
it look like a political maneuver to undercut the support of one of 
singhs populist rivals 
the policy is based on a muchcriticized study by an obscure 
politician of low caste bp mandal which languished for 10 years 
until singh revived it in his election platform last year 
the mandal commission classified 3000 castes as socially and 
educationally backward and recommended that 27 percent of 
government jobs be set aside for them the government employs some 
18 million people though the military and defense jobs are 
excluded from the quota system 
previously 22 percent were reserved for the lowest sector of 
society native tribes and untouchables the new policy left 
slightly more than half the jobs available on merit alone 
in a nation where millions of educated indians lack work the 
new quota sent shivers through the college campuses 
if i get 85 percent on my marks and he a lowcaste student 
gets 40 percent he will get the job aggarwal said i work 
very hard i know i must face competition now whats the point 
nandi said only 1700 jobs a year are affected by the government 
plan 
the students are overreacting he saidthe upper castes 
have a feeling of insecurity they are few in number and the lower 
castes are in a great majority 
singh argues his quotas will blur the distinctions of caste 
critics say he has revived the notion of caste as an instrument of 
state policy 
the caste system which began perhaps 2500 years ago 
categorized hindus into a social hierarchy determined by birth and 
sanctioned by religion 
some 20000subcastes derive from the four primary castes the 
brahmins who are priests teachers and astrologers kshariyas who 
comprise the royalty and warrior class vaisya who are merchants 
and traders and sudras who do the menial tasks 
below them all are the untouchables tradition forbids them from 
wearing shoes riding bicycles sharing a water well with caste 
hindus 
modern india which is 82 percent hindu embraced secularism and 
socialist ideals when it became independent from britain in 1947 
and pledged to discard the caste system 
urbanization economic mobility and the growth of a middle class 
have dimmed the traditional power of caste which once dictated who 
one married where one worked and even how one carried himself 
but its power is still considerable weekend classified pages 
publish columns of matrimonial offers based on caste most 
marriages still are arranged by parents 
caste is surviving theres no doubt but the role of caste is 
changing nandi said its not much different than ethnic 
groupings in the united states

an 8000yearold village under the sea 
has yielded an intriguing discovery a water well thought to be the 
oldest in the world 
the archaeologist who found the well says it suggests ancient 
man was smarter than previously thought 
the 6yearold dig beneath the mediterranean seabed has already 
turned up a trove of information about neolithic man findings 
include the remains of stone houses a fireplace preserved with its 
charred wood 23 buried skeletons the bones of the animals the 
villagers ate the seeds they planted the tools they made from 
bone and stone 
the latest excitement is over the discovery of several wells 
one of which was excavated and found to be 16 feet deep 
ehud galili the archaeologist heading the dig said the village 
is 7700 to 8000 years old so that the well is some 1000 years 
older than the oldest well known until now 
it is surprising because for the first time we have figured 
out that prehistoric man was aware of the existence of water tables 
under the ground and was able and had the proper technology to dig 
these wells and to use this fresh water he told reporters 
visiting the site thursday 
as far as i know this is the oldest well discovered from that 
period he said 
it raises fascinating questions how did ancient man know that 
if he dug deep enough he would strike fresh water and where did 
he acquire the skill to sink a round shaft paved with stone in 
much the same way as many modern wells are built 
the well was full of prehistoric trash bones broken tools and 
stones galili said he speculated that at some point its water had 
grown salty and it was turned into a garbage disposal pit 
with the end of the ice age the village disappeared beneath the 
mediterranean as melted ice raised the earths sea levels sea sand 
up to 12 feet thick preserved it 
the village covers about 10 acres and lies beneath 39 feet of 
water about 400 yards off the coast 
it is in a small bay overlooked by a crusader fort at athlit 10 
miles south of the port city of haifa the dig is sponsored by the 
governments antiquities authority 
like many underwater sites off israels coast it came to light 
because the creation of the jewish state in 1948 led to a 
construction boom huge amounts of beach sand were quarried 
depleting the protective layer over the undersea sites 
for archaeologists the underwater location is a cause for 
crises every storm disrupts the ancient undersea world and a 
wall or a skeleton that has lain undisturbed for thousands of years 
can be destroyed in a matter of weeks galili said 
among galilis more striking finds is the skeleton of a woman 
aged about 18 lying in a fetal position her hand making a 
clutching gesture 
nodules in the earholes of some skulls point to the inhabitants 
having been divers since such nodules result from a disease common 
among people who spend too much time under water he said 
galili said marks on the teeth in one skull suggest the man 
worked with ropes using his teeth to help knot them 
while there is no indication the villagers had already 
domesticated animals the seeds found at the site imply that they 
had learned to grow crops galili said

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is 
wielding less and less power and is in danger of becoming 
irrelevant as restive soviet republics wrest authority from the 
central government a senior administration official says 
the official insisting on anonymity said thursday that 
gorbachevs loss of power is a bigger threat to him than any coup 
by the military rumors of a military takeover have surfaced in 
moscow in recent days but the senior official discounted that 
possibility 
it is highly unusual that a government official even when 
guaranteed protection against being identified would offer such a 
candid and damaging assessment of a world leader of gorbachevs 
stature 
moreover the portrayal of gorbachev as a faltering figure 
clashes with the picture that president bush tried to project when 
he flew thousands of miles to helsinki this month to stand 
alongside the soviet president in a demonstration that the 
superpowers are united against iraq in the persian gulf crisis 
as a result the officials comments raised questions about 
whether the administration is reassessing its view of gorbachev 
asked if gorbachevs problems could complicate the way the united 
states deals with moscow the official replied i think it could 
it hasnt happened yet 
publicly bush has acknowledged that gorbachev has serious 
problems particularly with his crisisridden economy yet he has 
been unreserved in his praise of the soviet leader and has said it 
is in the best interest of the united states for him to remain in 
power 
the official made his comments in response to questions during 
an interview with news service reporters 
in a separate interview brookings institution scholar helmut 
sonnenfeldt said the administration is quite conscious of this 
decay of authority and power of gorbachev and his government 
i think that there is a crisis of authority thats been 
accumulating for some time said sonnenfeldt a specialist in 
eastwest relations who served in the nixon and ford 
administrations 
the central government and the president gorbachev himself 
are seriously lacking in authority sonnenfeldt said he 
gorbachev has this power that he has been getting from the 
supreme soviet but is it not clear that anybody pays any attention 
and implements his orders 
rumors have swept moscow in recent days of a military takeover 
amid curious troop movements in and around the city the rumors 
reached the point where soviet defense minister dmitri yazov felt 
compelled wednesday to pledge the militarys allegiance to the 
power structure and assert that the troop movements were routine 
the senior administration official said soviet history offers no 
precedent for such an attempt by the military 
i think one of gorbachevs big problems is not his own staying 
power the official said hes shown himself a pretty good 
master of that but hes commanding less and less and i think his 
real danger is becoming irrelevant 
in other words the official continued power just kind of 
gravitates away from the union government to the constituent to 
the republic governments 
the official said the kremlin still prevails on matters of 
foreign policy and the military 
but i think thats his danger now that hes being denuded of 
power the official asserted 
the official said it would be a setback if gorbachev were unable 
to make agreements that are binding on the system but were not 
there yet 
the official said most of the subjects being negotiated between 
washington and moscow are foreign policy and arms control matters 
that would be the last to be affected by the internal competition 
between the central government and the republics 
many of the soviet unions republics have declared independence 
and nationalist groups have been agitating for a break with moscow 
boris yeltsin elected recently as president of the russian 
republic the largest of the 15 has criticized gorbachev for the 
slow pace of economic reforms yeltsin has demanded aditional 
powers for the republics 
on monday the soviet legislature granted gorbachev sweeping new 
powers to take measures to stabilize the economy and to maintain 
law and order

the united states and the soviet union are close 
to agreement on a new treaty to cut their conventional arms in 
europe 
two of the three remaining disputes were basically resolved 
thursday at a meeting of secretary of state james a baker iii and 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
that left a disagreement over limiting aircraft to be ironed out 
in time for a 34nation summit in paris in midnovember 
the steady withdrawal of soviet troops and tanks from eastern 
and central europe along with sizable reductions in us forces 
among the nato countries are already accomplishing what the treaty 
negotiators set out to do 
however the accord would make reductions of weapons troops 
are being omitted legally binding and it would be a symbolic 
milestone in the easing of eastwest tensions 
baker and shevardnadze plan to meet again soon in new york to 
chip away at the aircraft issue and to make sure the tentative 
agreements on the two other issues stick 
one would establish zones in which noth atlantic treaty 
organization and warsaw pact arms would be limited the other would 
impose a ceiling on the percentage of either blocs weapons that 
any one nation could retain 
baker said after seeing shevardnadze that they had made some 
good progress toward the treaty the projected centerpiece of the 
34nation summit shevardnadze said they had made real headway 
the treaty between nato and the warsaw pact has been in 
negotiation in vienna since february 1989 an earlier 15year 
attempt to reduce tensions through cutbacks in troops and weapons 
failed 
but when soviet president mikhail s gorbachev set out to end 
the cold war the outlook brightened 
still nagging disputes stood in the way us and soviet 
negotiators racing the clock have been meeting daily since last 
week first in washington and since then in new york 
although the treaty is not complete baker and shevardnadze 
agreed to submit the tentative understandings on two of the three 
most troublesome issues to their allies 
immediately after the session baker briefed nato foreign 
ministers in new york for the special session of the united 
nations general assembly on the results 
a senior state department official told reporters meanwhile 
there was basic agreement with the soviets on establishing 
zones in which numerical limits would be placed on nonnuclear 
weapons 
also baker and shevardnadze tentatively agreed on how high a 
percentage of permissible weapons any one nation could have in its 
arsenal said the official who demanded anonymity 
the third major issue remains unresolved although baker 
volunteered that progress had been made on it 
it concerns whether all european landbased aircraft of the two 
alliances should be included in the treaty as the united states 
has proposed or whether planes the soviets say have defensive 
missions should be exempt 
we have removed most of the gaps the state department 
source said separately 
much of the spadework was done by us and soviet negotiators 
before baker and shevardnadze met 
they are trying to have all key issues settled so the 
painstaking process of preparing a text can begin and be completed 
by the time of the projected summit 
a senior french official briefing american reporters said he 
was confident the treaty would be ready for signing at the paris 
meeting 
one of thursdays breakthroughs concerned what technicians call 
the sufficiency rule 
it concerns whether any single member of nato or the warsaw pact 
should be allowed to hold more than 30 percent of permitted 
weapons as the bush administration proposes or be allowed up to 
40 percent as moscow favors 
evidently baker and shevardnadze struck a compromise on that 
question asked if they had agreed on 30 percent or 40 percent 
baker said its neither one of these 
we had a very productive discussion shevardnadze said i 
would like to note quite substantial progress and a better 
understanding we have made real headway 
earlier baker said the two sides still anticipate having a 
conventional forces treaty essentially agreed to in november or 
we will be unable to have a summit 
still unresolved are verification procedures for determining 
whether provisions of the treaty are being observed 
also unsettled is a separate proposed ussoviet treaty to 
reduce longrange nuclear missiles bombers and submarines by about 
30 percent bush hopes to sign that accord in moscow in december 
bush is expected to see shevardnadze when the president comes to 
new york this weekend to address the special general assembly 
session monday

by 1944 army careerist dwight david 
eisenhower had five stars an allied forces command but no 
hometown 
for years the man who later became the nations 34th president 
had incorrectly given tyler texas as his birthplace 
enter jennie jackson a retired schoolteacher principal and 
amateur historian in denison a small town 70 miles north of 
dallas 
she remembered rocking an eisenhower infant on her knee in 1890 
and wondered if it was the general 
she secretly wrote eisenhower who told her to contact his 
mother ida she wrote back confirming the general was indeed the 
same david eisenhower miss jackson remembered 
she then went public with a campaign to save the small clapboard 
house where eisenhower was born 
miss jackson died shortly after she persuaded the city to buy 
the house in 1946 but not before a reunion with the future 
president that year when he visited denison eisenhower was elected 
president in 1952 
the main thing was he was born in denison and that means a lot 
to have a president born here said vivian hassel 82 a former 
tour guide at the birthplace now a state historic landmark 
a failed grocery business in kansas and a new job with the katy 
railroad brought the eisenhower family to denison in 1888 mrs 
hassel said 
about eight months after eisenhower the third of seven sons 
was born oct 14 1890 the family moved to abilene kansas 
originally named david dwight eisenhower he reversed the names 
by high school 
on saturday and sunday denison residents will celebrate the 
100th birthday of the native son they almost never had with a 
parade 10kilometer run birthday party ball and even a president 
and mrs eisenhower lookalike contest 
attending the ceremonies will be sen phil gramm rtexas and 
eisenhowers nephew earl eisenhower jr 
a special coin commemorating the 100th birthday will be unveiled 
by the us department of treasury 
city officials are holding the anniversary early to prevent an 
overlap with the abilene celebration next month 
although the kansas city is also closely associated with 
eisenhower his denison connection is no secret 
last year more than 75000 tourists visited the modest 
twostory home and mayor ben munson said there are plans to double 
the size of the twoacre park where it is located 
a 15minute tour of the house includes the humorous tale of the 
tumbling block quilt the only original eisenhower family 
possession inside the birthplace 
sewn by eisenhowers mother and her sons including the former 
president it was donated by a family member years ago spurring a 
controversy among the eisenhower relatives 
for years the family fought over the ownership of the quilt 
said ajkeem elahi the parks manager this year a family member 
visited the house and laughed when she saw it 
she said theyre still fighting over that he said 
other items in the house include miss jacksons black spindle 
rocker and there is an oil portrait of an american indian painted 
by eisenhower after he became president 
winston churchill got him started on painting elahi said

saddam hussein is moving to transform kuwait 
into an iraqi province by altering the countrys demography 
erasing its national identity and removing its infrastructure us 
analysts say 
what we are seeing is the dekuwaitization of kuwait this is 
the history of the iraqi regime one us official said speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
the iraqi president has been changing kuwait since the aug 2 
invasion even renaming streets and institutions to eliminate 
signs of the ousted government officials said every passing day 
takes the country further away from what it once was 
at the same time the kuwaiti resistance inside the occupied 
country is faltering 
the resistance is past its apex an official said they 
put up a brave effort but they cant sustain it 
there were reports after the invasion of car bombings and 
killings of iraqi soldiers but the iraqis retaliated brutally 
making housetohouse searches to find resistance leaders kuwaiti 
exiles said 
saddams pattern in kuwait is similar to the way he rid iraq of 
internal dissidents analysts said its a fairly basic notion of 
depopulation said another official who also spoke on condition 
on anonymity 
so far what you see is a logical unfolding of saddams plan 
to secure kuwait as the 19th province of iraq he is changing the 
kuwaiti demography said richard w murphy a former assistant 
secretary of state for the middle east and a scholar at the council 
of foreign relations 
the man saddam put in charge of kuwait has a bloody past 
officials said 
known as the butcher of kurdistan iraqs minister of local 
government ali hasan almajid ordered poison gas used against 
kurdish dissidents in 1988 us officials said 
he was involved in the forced resettlement of 500000 kurds who 
were moved from the mountains to unfamiliar desert villages 
moreover he was responsible for rounding up 60000 shia moslems in 
1980 and forcibly trucking them to iran the shias were suspected 
of planting bombs in iraq 
the most recent attempt to make over kuwait came thursday when 
iraq gave kuwaitis until oct 31 to adopt iraqi citizenship the 
iraqi interior ministry did not say what would happen to kuwaitis 
who did not change their citizenship 
saddam might be planning to seek unsponsored elections once 
he has given kuwait a new complexion officials said 
that scenario could create fissures in the worldwide alliance 
against iraq partly because the alsabah royal family of kuwait is 
not resoundingly popular with other arab leaders according to 
hermann eilts director of boston universitys center for 
international relations 
kuwait had a population of about 25 million when iraq invaded 
officials said but only 550000 people were native kuwaitis and 
about 450000 of them were in the country at the time of the 
invasion since then the native kuwaiti population has dwindled to 
about 250000 officials said 
when kuwaitis have been allowed to flee the country as when 
iraq opened up the border to saudi arabia 10 days ago the iraqis 
have seized their identity cards and other papers before letting 
them go iraq also has detained young kuwaiti men 
large numbers of foreigners also live in kuwait including an 
estimated 300000 palestinians the largest foreign community still 
in kuwait there also are about 120000 indians many of whom are 
trying to leave scores of thousands of asians already have fled 
saddam has placed close to 200000 troops in kuwait with at 
least that many more across the border in iraq although saddam has 
yet to move iraqi citizens into kuwait to take over jobs he may do 
so in the future officials said 
saddams soldiers also have been aggressive in looting kuwait 
stealing everything from hospital equipment to traffic lights 
many goods food fruit and video recorders have shown up in 
the markets of baghdad where international trade sanctions have 
taken a toll on the number of goods available officials said 
saddam may be telling his people in effect that here is a 
payback one official said

supreme court nominee david souter can expect 
an easy confirmation vote in the senate next week following a 
lopsided endorsement by the judiciary committee 
but the breadth of voting support enjoyed by the new hampshire 
jurist belies widespread doubt lawmakers are expressing about what 
kind of justice hell make 
i will vote for judge souters confirmation i do not do so 
enthusiastically judiciary committee chairman joseph biden said 
before his panel voted 131 in favor of souter on thursday sen 
edward m kennedy dmass was the dissenter 
if president bush takes the ease of souters approval as a sign 
it can easily win an even more conservative choice in the future 
he would be wrong said biden ddel 
judge souter falls within the sphere of candidates acceptable 
to this committee he said other nominees could well fall 
outside of that sphere 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine announced thursday 
night that he and republican leaders had agreed to hold the senate 
confirmation vote tuesday 
bush hailed the committee action and renewed his request for a 
senate vote before the supreme court begins its new term monday 
but the jewish holiday of yom kippur this weekend and senate rules 
led mitchell to rule that out 
souter who would replace retired justice william brennan a 
liberal did not attend the committee meeting but issued a 
statement from new hampshire thanking the senators for their 
courtesy and consideration 
i am gratified by their action i await the decision of the 
full senate he said 
the key to souters acceptability to the committee was his 
insistence during the hearings that he was openminded on whether 
the court should reverse its 1973 roe vs wade ruling that 
legalized abortion 
is it likely that president george bush will nominate anyone 
who is strong in civil liberties and civil rights said sen paul 
simon dill we probably have as moderate a choice as george 
bush will send to the senate 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio said he was willing to give 
souter the benefit of the doubt of which he saw much 
the bottom line is that we just dont know how he will vote on 
such issues as privacy and discrimination metzenbaum said my 
sense is that david souter is a fair and openminded jurist who 
knows well the weight of the responsibilities which will be placed 
upon him 
i hope im not wrong metzenbaum said 
i hope i am wrong said kennedy one of only a handful of 
senators to oppose souter so far 
i am troubled that if judge souter joins the current closely 
divided supreme court he will solidify a 54 anticivil rights 
antiprivacy majority inclined to turn back the clock on the 
historic progress of recent decades kennedy said 
conservative republicans also had doubts about the nominee but 
felt obliged to support the president aspects of judge souters 
testimony were of little comfort to legal conservatives including 
this senator said sen gordon humphrey of new hampshire who 
still voted for him in committee 
norma mccorvey the plaintiff in the roe vs wade case said at 
a news conference in los angeles it is appalling that women may 
lose their reproductive rights the us senate judiciary committee 
should not have voted to confirm judge souter because he refused to 
answer the ultimate question of how he feels about abortion

fear matters says georgia state 
university economic forecaster donald ratajczak so it doesnt 
surprise him if the bush administration is dancing away from using 
the word recession to describe the state of the economy 
it doesnt surprise alfred kahn either a retired cornell 
university professor kahn was chairman of president carters 
council on wage and price stability he recalls what happened in 
1978 when he suggested that unless inflation were brought under 
control pronto the nation might face a deep depression 
stuart eizenstat a presidential aide called up and asked him 
if he might just quit using that word 
so next time out kahn used banana when he meant 
depression he talked about the great banana of 1929 he said 
if inflation werent brought under control the nation might have a 
big banana 
kahn learned a political lesson fear matters and words alone 
can trigger fear 
recession is a loaded word and economists who cant agree on 
whether the country is in one yet concur that the word itself can 
spur one on 
fear matters said georgia states ratajczak but 
obviously whats in the pocketbook matters too if the pocketbook 
is still jingling fear can soon be overcome 
people start looking at their budgets and seeing what they can 
live without they tend to make business slow down when they do 
that said bob dieli an economist for the northern trust co of 
chicago 
small wonder that when the bad news came out tuesday six weeks 
before an election white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
we dont believe we are in a recession right now he was 
commenting on the commerce departments report that the economy 
grew at a stagnant annual rate of 045 percent in the second 
quarter of this year 
and small wonder at least to linguist walker gibson that alan 
greenspan chairman of the federal reserve board of governors says 
hed like to redefine recession gibson is founder of the committee 
on public doublespeak of the national council of teachers of 
english 
the usual definition is that a recession occurs after six months 
of decline in the gross national product the total value of new 
goods and services in the nation greenspan told congress last week 
hed prefer a less rigid definition a true recession he said is 
a cumulative unwinding of economic activity 
richard rahn chief economist for the us chamber of commerce 
said he cant blame the white house for refusing to label the 
economys current state a recession 
if i were the president i wouldnt say we were in a 
recession either rahn said they are not in a position to 
give judgment calls the way we and other outsiders are they are 
the guardian of the statistics they need to be very very 
cautious 
the fear that the word recession triggers said gibson tells 
something about language itself the word recession he said 
almost certainly started as a euphemism for an even more fearsome 
word depression 
but its been used so long as a euphemism that its lost its 
power to euphemize he said now they talk about downturns

white house and congressional negotiators 
narrowed differences thursday over their budget problems with 
reported agreements on energy and luxury taxes and cuts in benefit 
programs but key disputes remained to block a deal that would 
avoid bonedeep cuts in federal programs on monday 
the two sides racing the calendar swapped offers into the 
early hours friday trying to put together the final pieces of a 
500 billion fiveyear deficitcutting package 
parts of the pact tentatively agreed to were an additional 
8centpergallon gasoline tax a small tax on the energy content 
of all fuels and 10 percent taxes on luxury items ranging from 
fancy cars to electronic equipment said one official who asked to 
not be identified 
about 60 billion in savings over the five years would come from 
cuts in medicare half would hit the elderly including about a 
570 increase in the 2860 monthly premium they pay for the 
programs hospitalization coverage 
another 14 billion in cuts would be made in federal workers 
employment and retirement benefits and 12 billion more would come 
from reductions in support payments for farmers 
the federal gasoline tax is now 9 cents per gallon states add 
additional taxes on top of that 
the energy tax would be threequarters of a cent per million 
btu a measure of eergy it takes about eight or nine gallons of 
gasoline to yield a million btu so the extra tax would amount to 
about 008 cents per gallon hardly enough to register at the pump 
applied to highquality coal burned by an electric utility the 
tax would raise the cost of a 500kilowatthour monthly electric 
bill for a small home by about 4 cents 
if successful before monday the bargainers would allow the 
government to sidestep 85 billion in spending cuts that the law 
would otherwise require the slashes would result in furloughs for 
many of the 21 million federal civilian workers including fbi 
agents and air traffic controllers 
republicans were willing to accept a toneddown version of the 
cut in capital gains tax rates that president bush has sought since 
he was a presidential candidate in 1988 the battle between 
democrats and the administration over the tax has been the key 
barrier to a budget deal 
capital gains the profits from the sale of assets such as 
corporate stock or houses are now taxed like ordinary income 
but democrats seemed uncertain about whether in return they 
would demand higher income tax rates on the wealthy or a limit on 
the tax deductions the welltodo could take said officials who 
asked to not be identified 
i dont mean to put it in a negative way but there is still a 
possibility of failure said house speaker thomas s foley 
dwash the odds are we will succeed 
bush had argued that cutting capital gains tax rates would boost 
the economy democrats say the tax cut would benefit the rich and 
want higher taxes on the wealthy in return 
but the president was now willing to leave the rates constant if 
the increased value of an asset due to inflation is exempted 
officials close to the talks have said the proposal would apply 
only to property purchased after the plan became law 
this official like all the others who discussed the various 
proposals tuesday night spoke on condition of anonymity 
still undecided however was which tax boost the two sides 
would agree to as a tradeoff 
republicans have proposed limiting income tax deductions for the 
wealthy said one official who asked to not be identified in one 
variation of the idea people earning more than 200000 annually 
would only be able to claim 95 percent of the deductions to which 
they would otherwise be entitled 
democrats are interested in that idea but have also advanced 
two other proposals said another official who demanded anonymity 
they remain interested in raising the topbracket income tax 
rate on the wealthiest americans from the current 28 percent 
people who are somewhat less welloff pay 33 percent in their top 
bracket 
democrats would like to boost the top rate on the rich but they 
are willing to settle for a new level below 33 percent 
they have also proposed lifting the earnings ceiling above which 
medicare taxes are not taken out of paychecks 
as part of social security withholding people now pay a 145 
percent tax to support medicare on earnings up to 51300 per year 
they pay nothing on money they earn above that amount under the 
proposal that ceiling would be lifted to 65000 or 75000 
the bargainers remained close to agreeing on cuts in defense and 
domestic programs 
the two sides appeared close to agreeing to reduce the military 
budget by 170 billion over the next five years from the amount it 
would need to stay abreast with inflation 
they were also trying to find a way to reduce spending on 
benefit programs by 120 billion over the five years 
one gop suggestion for finding additional savings in benefit 
programs was to delay next years costofliving increase for the 
39 million social security recipients for three months 
another official said republicans had offered to delay 
costofliving increases for 60 days for all federal benefits 
including social security veterans benefits and federal 
retirement programs 
democrats prefer increasing the tax on social security benefits 
recipients who earn 25000 annually 32000 for couples now 
must pay taxes on half their social security benefits the 
democratic proposal would boost that proportion to 85 percent 
earlier in the day bush continued to assail democrats as the 
culprits in the monthslong budget standoff which has brought the 
government to the brink of the new fiscal year without any spending 
legislation in place 
there may be senior citizens wondering why their social 
security checks are late bush said thursday at a gop breakfast 
in minneapolis citing a federal program that would be damaged by 
mondays automatic cuts we cant afford business as usual the 
american people deserve better 
increasingly restive rankandfile lawmakers democrat and 
republican complained that the compromise package in the works 
went too far to satisfy the opposite party the disgruntlement 
signaled potential problems for whatever congress is finally asked 
to vote on

luis santos secretary of local governments but santos guards 
were under investigation 
santos home is in davao city 610 mles southeast of manila on

condition of anonymity i dont know where it came from no one 
came in or out

santos arrived in davao on thursday at the invitation of local 
business leaders who were concerned about rumors of an impending 
military coup attempt 
during a meeting santos assured the businessmen that the 
government was stable and could cope with any emergency local 
fears intensified with the arrival of a marine battalion 
reinforcing troops chasing a renegade colonel who defected from 
mrs aquinos guard force and joined last decembers attempt to 
oust her 
santos was a former police chief of davao he assumed the 
cabinet post following the aug 20 1987 assassination of local 
governments secretary jaime ferrer 
two people were convicted of killing ferrer but the court never 
established who ordered his murder

the metropolitan operas fourth opera in four 
nights of its new season was a resoundingly sung don giovanni 
without a famous cast and with two notable debuts 
met artistic director james levine conducted the mozart 
masterpiece 
the young american baritone thomas hampson from spokane has 
the figure and voice for don giovanni bass paul plishka from old 
forge pa was a nice contrast deeper and more mature sounding 
as his servant leporello 
hampson might stress the swashbuckling a bit more he seemed 
more at ease when don giovanni was trying to woo subtly than when 
he was being his most rakish plishkas comic timing and stage 
presence were always on target 
hans peter blochwitz a tenor from garmisch germany made his 
met debut as don ottavio hes so good that if the baritone had 
been bad wed still have loved the evening 
blochwitz has sung ottavio with the vienna state opera in 
hamburg and amsterdam he has the perfect voice for mozart handel 
and bach which he has been singing one hopes that he has no 
interest in heavier music that would harm his voice and that he 
will return often to the met 
patricia schuman a native of los angeles made the other debut 
as donna elvira she switched from mezzosoprano to soprano in 
1985 has sung both the title roles in carmen and madama 
butterfly in san francisco in december shell sing opening 
night of the la scala season in mozarts idomeneo 
her voice is lovely and has enough vibrato for texture making a 
contrast to the evenings other two sopranos 
cheryl studer of detroit began the evening as the virginal donna 
anna with a small voice after don giovanni kills her father she 
is determined on revenge and sings with much more strength she hit 
and held high notes beautifully then sometimes grated when 
releasing notes but her final aria which includes coloratura 
singing was splendid and received much applause 
the other soprano marie mclaughlin of motherwell britain as 
zerlina was excellent too her bridegroomtobe masetto who can 
often be ignored was sung by julien robbins who made a solid role 
of it robbins from harrisburg pa also sang on opening night 
the current production by franco zeffirelli was new last

the senate ethics committee is at a turning 
point in its investigation of five senators who tried to help 
former savings and loan operator charles h keating jr when his 
institution was heading toward collapse 
committee members have been meeting over the last two weeks to 
decide whether the cases of some or all the senators should be 
either dismissed or expanded 
keatings lincoln savings and loan association in irvine 
calif was taken over by the government in april 1989 and it 
could cost taxpayers more than 2 billion to cover the thrifts 
losses 
keating and his associates contributed some 13 million to the 
campaigns and causes of the five senators republican john mccain 
of arizona and democrats alan cranston of california dennis 
deconcini of arizona john glenn of ohio and donald w riegle jr 
of michigan 
all have said their intervention was routine assistance for 
someone who complained of unfair treatment by regulators 
the committee meetings could end a preliminary inquiry any 
cases kept alive could bring those senators long ethics hearings 
structured like a trial 
the preliminary phase was announced by the sixmember committee 
last dec 22 and a few senators have grumbled that ethics 
investigations take too long 
in response sen jesse helms rnc a member of the committee 
of three democrats and three republicans said the senators on the 
panel wish it could be expedited 
asked if the long investigation was unfair to the senators known 
as the keating five helms replied how do you define 
unfairness do you suggest we dont work every angle we just have 
a heavy load 
the case is proving difficult because no specific senate rule 
provides guidelines on what constitutes undue influence by a member 
of congress who intervenes with regulators in this case all five 
senators met with regulators on keatings behalf 
the ethics committee must determine if the senators actions in 
the keating case violated a resolution prohibiting improper 
conduct which may reflect upon the senate 
the senators intervened with us banking regulators in april 
1987 on behalf of keating 
edwin j gray then chairman of the federal home loan bank 
board said the four senators with whom he met in the first of two 
meetings backed a deal to aid keatings future operations the 
senators all except riegle who did not attend vigorously 
denied that any deal was proposed 
at a second meeting with the regulators in charge of the lincoln 
examination all five senators were told that matters in the case 
would be referred to the justice department for a criminal 
investigation 
keating this month was indicted in california on state criminal 
fraud charges 
congressional sources said that lacking a specific rule on 
senators conduct with executive branch officials the ethics panel 
could seek guidance from the recent cases of former house speaker 
jim wright dtexas and sen dave durenberger rminn 
wright resigned from congress more than a year ago after the 
house ethics committee filed formal charges against him 
durenberger was denounced by the senate in july for violating 
senate rules on receipt of gifts speaking fee limits financial 
disclosure and campaign contributions 
in durenbergers case one key issue was not covered by a 
specific rule 
the ethics committee found that durenberger acted deceptively to 
hide his ownership in a minneapolis condominium from the senate so 
he could receive rent reimbursements to which he was not entitled 
the committee said the senator abused his office and misused 
funds through a pattern of improper conduct that has brought 
discredit upon the united states senate 
wright like the senators in the keating inquiry had intervened 
with the federal home loan bank board in the speakers case he 
did so on behalf of texans who complained of unfair treatment 
while the house ethics committee eventually found little 
evidence of undue influence by wright the special counsel in the 
case wrote of the principles governing proper and improper 
intervention 
the counsel richard phelan said a house advisory opinion 
considered it proper for a member to request information or a 
status report from regulators to urge prompt consideration of a 
matter arrange for interviews or appointments express judgments 
and call for reconsideration of a decision 
but phelan said a member should treat all constituents equally 
and there should be no direct or implied suggestion of favoritism 
or reprisal involving the agency

the national endowment for the arts is 
vigorously denying evangelist pat robertsons claim that it 
subsidized an atlanta arts festival last week where a childrens 
puppet show allegedly featured simulated oral sex 
this is just the latest example of the continual distortion of 
fact by the arts endowments most virulent critics those intent on 
eliminating the agency at any cost even that of the truth said 
nea spokesman jack lichtenstein 
robertson said thursday that his christian coalition based in 
chesapeake va had responded to the puppet show by sending every 
member of congress petitions demanding that the arts endowment be 
abolished 
the atlanta arts festival is supposed to be a family affair 
robertson said in a statement if the weirdos on the federal dole 
do not stop peddling obscenity and pornography members of congress 
will hear from angry voters in november 
robertson who was a presidential candidate in 1988 blanketed 
congress with the petitions as the house braced for an expected 
floor showdown next week over proposals to impose new 
antiobscenity curbs on the 171 million federal arts agency 
one of the proposed amendments sponsored by rep phil crane 
rill would abolish the nea the main bill would extend the 
agencys life for five years beyond sunday when its statutory 
authority expires 
lichtenstein and the georgia council on the arts which received 
400000 from the nea this year denied that any federal funds were 
spent on the atlanta festival or the puppet show 
festival officials said the puppet show staged as a 
surrealistic morality play for adult audiences only was 
financed entirely by ticket sales and concession receipts without 
support from any government source 
atlanta puppeteer jon ludwig who wrote and designed the show 
titled zeitgeist denied robertsons charge that the 
performance featured approximately five minutes of simulated 
foreplay between two puppets followed by an exhibit of oral sex 
acts 
this was a scene about temptation ludwig said it was 
intended to be satirical after all what literally happened is 
that two pieces of plastic rubbed against each other 
it was not simulated oral sex its impossible how can 
puppets do that they dont even have the parts it was like 
finding children playing with ken and barbie dolls in the back room 
and calling pat robertson ludwig said 
robertsons protest apparently originated with the rev john 
norton a 55yearold methodist minister from the atlanta suburb of 
marietta who said he wandered into the puppet show at the festival 
last friday night 
i have no problem with oral sex norton said the next day 
but an open oral sex show for children to visualize and 
experience in one of their popular forms of entertainment is more 
than i felt belonged on public display 
ludwig said the show won a standing ovation from the audience of 
800 people and a favorable review in the local press patricia 
gann the festivals executive director said the only complaint 
came from norton 
ms gann said a halfdozen children watched the 45minute show 
even though the audience had been warned repeatedly through 
posted signs and preperformance announcements that the 
production was suitable for adults only

not many americans have ever thought much 
about the sudan but for the state department that east africa 
giant suddenly has become a problem that is making a lot of 
diplomats sit up and take notice 
its hard to imagine a more luckless place than sudan a country 
three times the size of texas with the potential to be africas 
breadbasket but it has been plagued by virtually every calamity 
that can befall a people drought civil war and misrule 
the sudan story lacks the drama or the security component of the 
persian gulf for us policy makers it is above all a story of 
human deprivation on a massive scale a story of millions of 
desperate people many of whom are dying slow deaths 
things are bad and getting worse and us officials hope to be 
able to talk about the situation with sudanese president omar 
elbashir who was arriving in new york this afternoon for the 
united nations summit meeting on children 
when describing elbashirs tenure as head of a military 
government us officials no longer bother about diplomatic 
niceties 
i think it would be well if sudans leaders looked back at the 
last drought in subsaharan africa eleven of 13 governments were 
overthrown by popular outrage by failure to respond said andrew 
natsios the top us official for foreign disasters 
half the country is starving to death that is a recipe for 
massive political convulsions 
among other alleged misdeeds natsios accuses elbashir of 
ordering air raids on a barge carrying food supplies this past week 
at a time when top officials of his government were seeking 150 
million in new food aid from the united states 
the presumed purpose of the bombing missions is to prevent food 
from reaching the hungry in territory held by southernbased rebels 
who have been fighting northern domination for years other air 
raids have taken place near un food relief sites natsios said 
the sudanese embassy had no comment on the allegations 
more than a quarter of a million sudanese died of disease and 
starvation two years ago experts predict an even worse situation 
this year some estimates run into the millions because the 
drought has returned and interest among donors in a major relief 
effort is feeble so far other contributing problems are rampant 
nepotism and the countrys awful economic policies according 
to a state department expert 
chronic civil war between the moslem north and the nonmoslem 
south has produced more than 3 million displaced people out of a 
population of more than 20 million more than 380000 have fled to 
refugee camps in ethiopia 
numerous foreign relief workers have abandoned the sudan in 
frustration as an example a train loaded with food earmarked for 
the hungry in southern sudan officials say has been sitting idle 
for more than a year at a northern site denied permission by the 
government to deliver its cargo 
with the help of a 100000ton food contribution the united 
states and other foreign donors were able to keep human suffering 
in sudan to a minimum last year now sudanese authorities have 
asked the united states for a food donation 10 times last years 
combined total 
how the united states will respond has been the subject of 
internal deliberations this week there is another issue almost 
forgotten in the face of more pressing problems on the 
ussudanese agenda sudan is one of the few countries worldwide 
that has shown sympathy for the iraqi side in the persian gulf 
crisis

prime minister toshiki kaifu left for new york 
today to begin a 12day trip to the united states and the middle 
east in which he will explain japans response to the persian gulf 
crisis 
kaifu will be the first leader of a major industrialized country 
to visit the gulf region following iraqs invasion of kuwait nearly 
two months ago 
he will travel to egypt jordan turkey saudi arabia and oman 
after attending a united nations conference on children in new york 
and meeting with president bush on sunday 
one topic of discussion is certain to be the plan unveiled by 
kaifu on thursday to send noncombat military personnel overseas 
despite japans nowar constitution 
they would participate in a un peace cooperation corps which 
kaifu stressed would only be used for peacekeeping activities and 
would not need to be armed 
the government argues that creation of the corps would not 
require revision of japans postworld war ii constitution that 
renounces the use of force to settle international disputes 
it is unclear if the corps would be available to assist us and 
other forces in the saudi arabian desert because parliament will 
have to approve the plan 
kaifus announcement came amid criticism from the united states 
that japan should do more to support the multinational force 
arrayed in the gulf to deter further aggression from iraq which 
invaded kuwait aug 2 
japan has pledged to contribute 4 billion including 2 billion 
in logistical support for the gulf forces and 600 million in 
emergency commodity loans to egypt turkey and jordan 
the remaining 14 billion is to be disbursed to those three 
nations and other countries hurt by the crisis 
japan last month also pledged to send about 100 civilian medical 
personnel to the middle east

a computergenerated telephone call tells an 
11yearold boy he can win a trip and a prize if he dials a 900 
longdistance number and answers the question what is the name 
of batmans car 
he gets confused when he calls the number and keeps dialing 
repeatedly he gets nothing mom gets a 120 phone bill 
a tv ad asks kids to call santa claus using a 900 number the 
callers then are told that santa is in the bathroom so they should 
call back later no santa big phone bills 
rep bart gordon dtenn cited these and other horror 
stories thursday while urging the house telecommunications 
subcommittee to adopt his bill to impose strict federal regulations 
on the burgeoning 900number audiotext industry 
gordon said 120 is not as much as some have lost on these 
services but it is more than many people have for such nonsense 
he said it was ironic that the telephone company involved in the 
batman case in which the answer was the batmobile had a 
policy of not carrying services directed at children 
the attitude seems to be policy or no policy if there is 
money to be made let it slide gordon said 
there is a lot of money to be made in 900 calling said the 
subcommittees chairman rep edward markey dmass he said the 
industry had revenues of 480 million in 1989 and is expected to 
double that this year by 1992 it is expected to be a 32 billion 
industry he said 
most of the audiotext industry is legitimate witnesses said 
but they said companies that impose excessive charges and use 
deceptive ads for games of chance sex talk easy credit pitches 
and chats with santa claus are creating the prospect that a few 
renegades will kill off a valuable public service 
markey cited examples of consumers being duped into calling a 
900 number to obtain a preapproved credit card or to claim 
nonexistent prizes only to receive a message to call yet another 
900 number at a cost of up to 25 per call 
gordons bill among other things would require free blocking 
of 900 numbers free introductory messages describing the service 
clearly stated charges and billing procedures and a onetime 
opportunity to stop charges incurred through misunderstandings or 
unauthorized use 
the federal communications commission would be given oversight 
of the audiotext industry 
industry representatives testified against the bill they said 
it would increase costs for everyone and that more vigorous 
enforcement of existing state and federal laws was the answer they 
also said they were starting to police themselves 
audiotext companies offer many popular services to callers who 
dial 900prefix numbers including weather sports theater 
information oneway chats with music personalities shopping 
information stock quotes and political pitches the calls usually 
are carried by longdistance companies that do the billing under 
contract with the service provider 
customers typically receive flatrate or perminute charges for 
the calls on their phone bills 
it is my view that 900number services have the potential to 
be the telemarketing consumer fraud problem of the 1990s said 
daniel clearfield executive deputy in the pennsylvania state 
attorney generals office 
each day throughout the united states thousands of telephone 
consumers are being victimized by 900 numbers which provide either 
fraudulent or worthless services or which fail to adequately 
advertise or otherwise inform callers of their 900number call 
clearfield said 
he said attorneys general in pennsylvania texas missouri 
kansas california wisconsin and new york were pursuing remedies 
to 900number fraud but that national standards were needed he 
said the federal trade commission also was conducting some 
investigations 
ken mceldowney executive director for san franciscobased 
consumer action of california rejected industry contentions that a 
few bad apples were spoiling the 900 barrel 
he said a national survey by his group concluded that most 
advertised 900 numbers are unfair at any price

uranium miners and western residents who lost 
their health from exposure to nuclear weapons tests would get a 
formal apology and compensation under legislation headed to 
president bushs desk 
the house on thursday approved a bill that authorizes 100 
million for a radiation exposure trust fund to pay people who 
developed cancer from either mining uranium or because they lived 
downwind of the nevada test site for the atomic bomb 
the senate passed the bill previously 
we are here saying that as a nation in the dangerous and 
difficult postwar period we were confronted with a brand new 
technology said rep barney frank dmass who led debate on 
the bill before the voice vote feeling very much threatened and 
needing that technology for our defense we acted hastily 
he said residents in the test area were exposed to levels of 
radiation we would not allow now miners were sent into the mines 
without even the slightest protection against the material they 
were being asked to mine 
frank said the bill is an acknowledgement that the government 
was wrong 
people with cancer who lived in nevada arizona or utah downwind 
from nuclear testing between 1951 and 1958 or between june and 
july 1962 would be eligible for compensation under the 
legislation 
uranium miners in colorado new mexico arizona wyoming and 
utah from 1947 to 1971 who got cancer also would be eligible 
it would be up to the justice department to determine the amount 
of compensation for each person and process claims 
a driving force behind the legislation was stewart udall a 
former congressman and interior secretary whose brother rep 
morris udall dariz is chairman of the house interior committee 
he represented the uranium miners in a lawsuit against the 
federal government the courts ruled the government was immune from 
prosecution because national security dictated a need for the 
uranium but judges involved in the case urged the miners to seek 
redress from congress 
rep wayne owens dutah who once was a lawyer for the downwind 
residents sponsored the legislation 
owens said the government knowing the dangers of nuclear 
fallout did not conduct testing when the wind was blowing toward 
the higher population centers in california and las vegas 
in very real fact the federal government made the decision to 
bomb these people to whom this bill makes an apology and a 
compensatory payment of a small amount he said 
further legislation is needed to appropriate the money to 
actually pay the victims if this bill becomes law

a 70 million satellite is sending important 
weather data today because engineers overcame a problem that 
threatened to send it crashing to earth 
we would have lost half of our capability russell koffler 
deputy assistant administrator of the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration said thursday of the nearfailure 
the satellite known as noaa11 is the more important of two 
that orbit the earth poletopole providing visible and infrared 
pictures to forecasters koffler said 
it actually takes the temperature measurements of the 
atmosphere over the globe he said it provides the basic 
underlying information for the guy who gets on the radio and says 
its going to be sunny tomorrow 
the satellite was launched sept 24 1988 from vandenberg air 
force base calif it operates normally at an altitude of 529 
miles with four gyroscopes three for directional control so it 
wont tumble and one backup 
one gyro failed in august 1989 and the backup was put into 
service that left no spare and noaa asked programmers at general 
electrics astro space division in princeton nj to write new 
computer instructions to allow the satellite to operate on a single 
gyro 
that work was to have been finished in 1991 but ground 
controllers recently sensed that a second gyro was about to fail 
programmers from ge noaa and the national aeronautics and space 
administration accelerated the effort which cost 230000 
the instructions were radioed to the satellite aug 8 
fortyfour days later last friday the ailing gyro failed as 
predicted 
koffler said there are no more miracles in store for noaa11 if 
the operative gyro fails 
the other one cant be used to control the satellite he 
said

congress is moving to give president bush 
authority to conduct a bigger test sale from the nations 
strategic petroleum reserve 
energy secretary james watkins provided the opening thursday for 
a second release of oil from the stockpile without forcing the 
declaration of an energy emergency by saying the 5millionbarrel 
sale bush ordered a day earlier is too small to test the system 
recalling that the administration just two weeks ago had 
threatened to veto a larger test sale rep phil sharp dind 
asked watkins at a hearing by house energy and commerce 
subcommittees how large a test he would like 
three times the 5 million number is the number the 
secretary replied we want to run half a million barrels a day to 
test the system 
the strategic reserve created in 1975 consists of 590 million 
barrels of crude oil stored in salt deposits in texas and 
louisiana 
we welcome the change said sharp who had his staff draft a 
bill authorizing a new test sale of 15 million barrels and gather 
the signatures of several other committee members on it while 
watkins was testifying 
anticipating no opposition in the senate sharp said the bill 
could be on bushs desk in two weeks 
despite the test sale that bushs spokesman said was also 
intended to signal traders to slow their speculation on the 
future cost of oil spot prices for west texas intermediate crude 
rose another 90 cents per 42gallon barrel thursday to 3955 
double its price in july 
were not going into this test with the idea that its going 
to bring the cost down 8 a barrel or something watkins said 
thats not the purpose if iraqi president saddam hussein makes 
another threat the market could jump again irregardless of the 
test sale 
he emphasized that the test is not a drawdown but will 
give us optimum readiness to open the spigot if that is required 
in the future 
bid notices on the 5millionbarrel test were to be sent out 
today and the energy department expects to award contracts for it 
in midoctober 
bob porter a department spokesman said an average of 167000 
barrels of oil far short of the 500000 barrels that analysts say 
is needed to drive prices down will be released daily for 30 
days 
we think the bulk of the oil will be transported in 
november porter said if the pipelines or tankers can take it 
well deliver it to them the next day but typically it takes 30 
days for the commercial docks to schedule pickups 
top lawmakers including senate republican leader bob dole of 
kansas have been urging bush for more than a month to tap the 
reserve to stem the rapid rise in oil prices since iraqs takeover 
of kuwait on aug 2 and the subsequent embargo removing about 43 
million barrels daily from the world market 
before acting wednesday bush had repeatedly contended there was 
no actual shortage and no justification for tapping the 
governments emergency oil stockpile just because of rising prices 
watkins reaffirmed that policy thursday but acknowledged it 
could change quickly because of the growing tightness in world 
supplies as winter nears 
he also cited problems that saudi arabia is having with corroded 
pipelines in trying to make up for production from iraq and kuwait 
and increased chances of fire or explosions at us refineries now 
running near 100 percent capacity 
us crude stocks are above normal as of the moment but they 
could go below normal by the end of october watkins said 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the energy and commerce 
committee said the administration needs to follow up on the test 
sale by calling on west germany and france at a meeting today in 
paris of the 21nation international energy agency to also tap 
their emergency stockpiles 
the tankers that left iraq and kuwait when the crisis began 
will soon unload their cargo dingell said no more oil will 
follow and at that point the real effects of a shortfall will hit 
the administration should prepare for those eventualities now

democratic party chairman ronald h brown says 
his personal view is that jesse jackson wont make a third run 
for president in 1992 
right now no democrat is showing much interest in a 1992 race 
and brown said he intends to encourage the presidential ambitions 
of prominent democrats after the 1990 elections 
im not advocating smokefilledroom politics the party 
chairman said during a wideranging interview i am advocating 
commonsense pragmatic politics which says were serious about 
winning the white house and which says if youre serious about 
that youve got to take some risks and youve got to be willing to 
take some heat 
we havent been real successful five of the last six times and 
to ignore that fact is really lacking in good judgment brown 
said this week referring to the fact the democrats have elected 
only one president since 1968 
brown also said he wont urge the senate leadership to grant 
floor privileges to jackson as a shadow senator from the district 
of columbia 
im for statehood brown said during the interview im 
not into the perks debate 
as for presidential politics brown who helped jackson in the 
closing stages of his 1988 campaign said i think its a tougher 
political environment for him now a more difficult political 
environment more to overcome 
brown said he believed it was appropriate for a party chairan 
to urge people to get into the race and also to urge candidates to 
drop out when it is clear someone has outdistanced the field 
brown said he was determined to get a consensus candidate 
early in the process and start running against george bush rather 
than against each other 
in his two previous campaigns for the nomination jackson fought 
on to the convention long past the time he had any hope of 
becoming the nominee 
but when asked if he had jackson in mind when he talked about 
the need to persuade some candidates to get out of the race when 
they no longer had any hope of winning brown replied 
i think there is too much emphasis almost to the point of 
obsession with whether jesse is going to run or not going to run 
its significant but i dont think its the principal factor in 
the 1992 race its a decision hell have to make and if he does 
he does if he doesnt he doesnt 
the chairman added my personal view is that he doesnt run 
but he said that view was not based on any clear signal from 
jackson 
in fact in the summer of 1989 when jackson moved to the 
district of columbia brown predicted he would run for mayor a 
plan he still insists was jacksons intent 
after mulling the race jackson announced he would not run 
instead he opted for the symbolic office of shadow senator 
in november voters in the nations capital will elect two 
shadow senators to lobby congress to grant the city statehood 
jackson got close to 80 percent of the vote in the sept 11 
primary 
jackson has not said he would demand access to the senate floor 
but his certain election to the post has spurred speculation that 
he would make such a request 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine has kept his 
silence on the subject 
brown said he thought it was a mistake for jackson to run for 
shadow senator and indicated he assumes jackson would seek floor 
privileges 
that creates a very unpleasant confrontation with the senate 
leadership he said

neil bush the presidents son combatively denied 
conflictofinterest charges stemming from his role as adirector 
of a failed savings and loan 
at the final day of an administrative hearing thursday bush 
interrupted a government lawyer and drew admonitions several times 
from the judge 
bush acknowledged he was a gobetween for a line of credit 
that silverado banking savings and loan association of denver 
extended to two developers he had business dealings with 
but bush said he had no financial interest in the projects for 
which the credit was extended the two developers eventually 
defaulted on more than 132 million in silverado loans 
bush 35 was a director of the thrift which failed in 1988 
leaving taxpayers with a 1 billion tab for bailing out depositors 
on several occasions adminstrative law judge daniel j davidson 
warned bush to answer questions directly and not to interrupt the 
government lawyer stephen hershkowitz 
youre doing it again davidson scolded bush at one point 
but you have to wait until the counsel finishes his question 
because its very difficult for the court reporter to take down 
two people talking at once 
bush replied my lawyers advised me i should listen im 
sorry 
he quickly resumed his combative tone however and drew new 
warnings from the judge 
in february the federal office of thrift supervision brought an 
administrative action against bush that could lead to his being 
barred from the banking industry 
the regulators contend bush failed to adequately inform fellow 
silverado directors of his business ties with developers kenneth 
good and bill walters 
bush insisted he had absolutely no doubt that his business 
dealings with good and walters did not conflict with his role as a 
silverado director consequently bush said he did not consult 
with silverados management about the question of a potential 
conflict 
aside from an appearance in may before a congressional committee 
investigating silverado bushs fight with regulators mainly had 
taken the form of briefs and counterbriefs submitted to davidson 
at his longawaited appearance at the threeday administrative 
hearing bush hadnt lost any of the defiance of his testimony on 
capitol hill 
bush insisted several times that although good and walters 
invested in his oil company jnb exploration he had no financial 
interest in the projects for which they got loans from silverado 
previous testimony showed silverado extended a 900000 line of 
credit to a partnership formed by bush and good to explore for oil 
and gas in argentina the line of credit intended to persuade 
argentine officials that the venture had strong financial 
resources never was used 
under questioning from hershkowitz bush said lawyers for goods 
company suggested bush present the credit line proposal to the 
silverado board 
i was a gobetween bush said 
bush insisted there was no conflict of interest in his role 
because he didnt stand to gain any financial benefit from the 
credit line which he described as a sort of letter of 
referral and because he abstained from voting on the proposal 
bush said he couldnt remember if it was his own idea to abstain 
from voting on the line of credit or if someone suggested it to 
him 
davidson will examine testimony from the hearing and in january 
recommend to timothy ryan office of thrift supervision director 
what sanctions if any should be taken against bush ryan is 
expected to make a decision in may 
bush would have the right to appeal to a federal court 
last week the federal deposit insurance corp sued bush and 
other former silverado directors for 200 million alleging that 
gross negligence on their part contributed to the sampls collapse 
bush was a director of silverado from august 1985 to august 
1988

first a patient hears the cancer diagnosis and 
then learns that the needed chemotherapy may cause temporary 
baldness for many the loss of hair is a huge cosmetic burden 
piled on the already terrible physical trauma of disease 
but help may be on the way according to a study published today 
in the journal science 
dr aa yunis of the university of miami jackson memorial 
hospital medical center reports that he and his colleagues have 
discovered by chance that an experimental cancer drug blocks 
hair loss in laboratory rats injected with some chemotherapy 
agents 
if the finding can be translated into drugs to treat humans an 
expert said it would be of tremendous benefit to cancer 
patients who now must endure the characteristic mark of 
chemotherapy baldness 
yunis said his team made the discovery while testing 
cancerfighting drugs on lab rats that had been injected with 
leukemia cells 
half of the rats were treated with a drug called cytosine 
arabinoside or arac the rest were treated with a combination of 
arac and an experimental drug called imuvert 
we found lo and behold that the rats with arac only became 
nude they lost all their hair said yunis the ones with both 
arac and imuvert however did not lose hair at all 
yunis said his group then tested imuvert with another common 
cancer drug doxorubicin or dx he said they found that rats with 
the dximuvert combination also experienced no hair loss while 
rats receiving only the dx lost hair on their heads and shoulders 
imuvert combined with a third cancer drug cyclophosphamide 
however did not prevent hair loss in the rats said yunis 
dr ed gelmann chief of the department of medical oncology at 
georgetown university in washington said that if a way can be 
found to prevent hair loss patients will feel much better about 
chemotherapy 
chemotherapy baldness is nearly always temporary the hair 
usually grows back after the treatment cycle 
nonetheless said gelmann a lot of patients focus on hair 
loss because it is so apparent it can be quite a stigma it would 
be a tremendous benefit to eliminate hair loss as long as it did 
not change the efficacy of the cancer chemotherapy 
yunis said that imuvert appears to help combat leukemia while it 
is preventing chemotherapy baldness he said the drug teamed with 
arac halted the progression of leukemia in all but 20 percent of 
the laboratory rats tested this result was better than among rats 
treated with arac alone he said 
dr gregory curt director of the clinical oncology department 
at the national cancer institute said controlling hair loss during 
chemotherapy is a very serious thing for patients 
the two things that concern patients the most about 
chemotherapy are nausea and that some people can get bald he 
said there are drugs to control the nausea but there is no pill 
to block the hair loss 
for both men and women it is one of the side effects that 
concerns people the most because it changes ones body image 
said curt 
the physician said he remembers at least two patients who were 
so concerned about the loss of hair that they actually refused 
lifesaving chemotherapy 
imuvert now is being tested as a chemotherapy agent against 
brain cancer yunis said it could be several years before it is 
approved for use on patients 
he said the discovery also gives researchers a clue that may 
help find even more effective drugs to block hair loss among 
chemotherapy patients 
he said imuvert is a drug known as a biological response 
modifier because it alters the way some cells in the immune system 
act if the precise effect of this drug on the hair follicles could 
be identified then new drugs with this action could be developed 
said yunis 
science which today published the university of miami research 
report is the journal of the american association for the 
advancement of science 
coauthors of the paper with yunis are atif m hussein and 
joaquin j jimenez of the university of miami and catherine a 
mccall of cell technology inc

more than half a million people developed aids 
worldwide in the past decade but the worst is yet to come an 
expert said at an international aids symposium 
there is clearly going to be a wave that makes the experience 
of the 80s look relatively small at least a 10fold increase 
said dr jonathan mann director of the international aids center 
at the harvard school of public health 
this is still a very new pandemic mann told delegates at a 
conference thursday sponsored by the morehouse school of medicine 
and the federal governments research centers in minority 
institutions the worst is yet to come 
a pandemic is an epidemic over a large region 
mann cited projections saying at least 8 million people 
worldwide are infected with hiv the virus that causes aids that 
includes an estimated 5 million in africa and 1 million in the 
united states 
a comparatively low 600000 aids cases occurred worldwide in the 
1980s he said 
we are not in a good state of affairs when it comes to aids 
and hiv in the united states and in the world concurred dr 
james curran medical director of the hivaids division at the 
centers for disease control 
the united states where 4000 aids cases were reported between 
1981 and 1984 reported that same number in just the past four 
weeks curran said 
those at the greatest risk have to learn to change their 
behavior or die its that simple curran said 
nationwide 146746 aids cases have been reported in the united 
states since the disease was first detected in 1981 89761 
patients have died 
the us public health service projects between 390000 and 
480000 aids cases in this country by the end of 1993 
we are far from turning a corner with aids in our own 
country curran said

branstads brother during negotiations over a farm loan 
the aide des moines attorney doug gross said that he spoke 
with farm credit service officials about the loan but said he did 
so as a private lawyer after being contacted by branstads brother 
monty 
he was thinking about suing them and called me and asked me 
about the merits of the suit gross said i never talked to the 
governor about it ever 
the flap first surfaced in reports published by the mason city 
globegazette the newspaper quoted farm credit officials as saying 
gross called to urge them to sell to monty at a low figure 
monty branstad had been bargaining over land that had been 
foreclosed on but that he wanted to repurchase 
gross said he spoke twice to ray mechem assistant vice 
president for farm credit services mason city office 
i identified myself as an attorney from des moines gross 
said i told him this had nothing to do with the governor 
gross said farm credit services officials told him they would 
not sell the land back to monty branstad for less than the assessed 
value 
he ended up paying the assessed value and didnt even talk to 
me about it gross said 
democratic state chairman john roehrick said the account raises 
new questions about whether republican governor terry branstad 
used his political clout to improperly help his brother monty 
branstad obtain preferential treatment for his troubled farm 
finances

ruler of kuwait 
iraqs interior ministry thursday published a new law saying 
citizens of kuwait which iraq has proclaimed its 19th province 
have until oct 31 to adopt iraqi citizenship it did not say what 
would happen to those who failed to meet the deadline 
iraq was the target of a blistering new round of western 
criticism on thursday after a threat against diplomats who shelter 
foreigners in a note delivered to some western embassies on 
wednesday iraqi officials said giving sanctuary to a foreigner was 
punishable by death 
the iraqi foreign ministry refused to elaborate on the message 
but iraqi officials speaking on condition of anonymity said it was 
referring to iraqis harboring westerners not to diplomats giving 
refuge to their own nationals 
western governments reacted with anger anyway 
iraqs threat makes it impossible to take seriously any 
pretensions on its part to be a civilized state britains 
foreign office said 
in paris a french foreign ministry spokesman in paris called 
the threat utterly intolerable

been picked up in kuwait a day earlier bringing the total of

what would be the first such overseas deployment of japanese forces 
since world war ii but kaifu said they would be unarmed and kept 
away from combat 
he left tokyo today for the united states and visits bush on 
sunday 
in washington us officials said saddams security shield is 
so thick and mobile that the only way the iraqi president will be 
toppled is if one of his intimate advisers turns against him 
he doesnt allow a whiff of opposition said an official 
another also speaking on condition of anonymity said saddam is 
believed to be preparing for what he sees as an inevitable 
battle over kuwait but is unwilling to provoke war himself

cope with the huge influx of refugees from iraq and kuwait at a

iraq has tightened its vise on occupied 
kuwait through systematic terror in an effort to wipe out remaining 
resistance residents and officials say 
iraqi authorities are trying to forcefeed kuwaitis a new iraqi 
nationality they have ordered kuwaitis to trade their nationality 
documents for iraqi citizenship and change their kuwaiti currency 
for iraqi dinars 
in his latest pledge to retain control over kuwait iraqi 
president saddam hussein told a visiting delegation of islamic 
theologians monday he will never withdraw even if we have to 
fight for 1000 years 
iraq has increased its troop strength in kuwait to 430000 
adding 70000 soldiers in just two weeks us officials said in 
washington this week iraq also continues to deploy tanks and other 
armor within striking distance of saudi arabia the dfense 
department officials said 
meanwhile refugees from kuwait are still trickling out 
bringing more tales of terror 
a kuwaiti refugee interviewed in the saudi capital of riyadh 
who gave his name only as abdullah told of a man he knew who 
complied with the iraqi order to turn in firearms 
the police shot him in the head put his body in a garbage 
bag and left it in front of his house he recalled 
egyptian doctors who recently left kuwait where they had been 
working at hospitals said iraqi soldiers claim officers lied to 
troops to trick them into taking part in the aug 2 invasion 
they were originally told that troops all over the arab 
world were gathering together and going to egypt and then they 
would invade israel jilan abdelwahab one of the doctors told 
a news conference in cairo 
another doctor yehia mohammed said he saw iraqi soldiers shoot 
to death five kuwaiti children for joining antiinvasion

born prematurely died when iraqi troops removed them from 
incubators they stole 
gnehm has been named to replace current ambassador nathaniel 
howell who is holed up inside the us embassy in kuwait 
defiance runs strong among kuwaitis who have stayed said 
michael mcmurtry a british geologist still in kuwait in a letter 
published in the times this week 
nearly all kuwaitis remaining can be said to belong to the 
kuwait resistance he wrote 
he said the resistance had killed iraqi troops and destroyed 
ammunition trucks 
although they are helplessly outnumbered the resistance have 
played an invaluable role in keeping the iraqi troops on the 
alert he wrote 
some palestinians are reportedly helping the iraqis run the 
occupied country but palestinians sympathetic to the kuwaitis have 
also emerged the daily alkhaleej a newspaper in the united arab 
emirates reported thursday 
the paper also reported that iraqi units were turning 
cemeteries into military barracks because they know a kuwaiti 
respects the dead and believes it is sinful to kill anyone in a 
burial site 
iraqs efforts at changing the face of kuwait continued with 
thursdays announcement that firstclass kuwaiti citizens or 
nativeborn kuwaitis whose parents are also kuwaiti must adopt 
iraqi nationality by oct 31 
on monday iraq said the kuwaiti currency the dinar would be 
invalid after oct 6 and must be exchanged for iraqi dinars 
iraqis continue to be resettled in kuwait as part of an effort 
to change kuwaits demographics according to a dissident iraqi 
minority 
but iraqi soldiers are suffering from food shortages and low 
morale themselves said the dissident group the kurdistan 
democratic party of iraq in recent statements 
exiled kuwaiti officials say iraq is trying to force kuwaitis 
from their homeland and repopulate it with iraqis and others

alaska stands to reap a windfall of 
millions of dollars in oil revenue thanks to the persian gulf 
crisis and gov steve cowper wants to sock most of it away for a 
rainy day 
cowper and many lawmakers argue that a fund is needed to ease an 
expected drop in oil revenues later this decade as alaska oil 
production declines oil gas taxes and royalties account for about 
85 percent of state revenues 
the governor said thursday if oil prices dont collapse before 
the end of the year the state will have a substantial surplus 
the increase in state revenues since iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 
already has erased the projected deficit that prompted cowper in 
july to veto 325 million from the 29 billion fiscal 1991 budget 
each 1 rise in the price of one barrel of oil adds 150 million 
to alaskas treasury over a year this years budget was based on 
oil selling at 1933 prices this week have been double that 
cowper who declined to seek a second term and leaves office 
dec 3 said he will propose that the 1991 legislature restore some 
budget cuts when it convenes in late january but place most of the 
windfall in a budget reserve 
voters will decide nov 6 whether to amend the state 
constitution to create a reserve fund 
its prudent to do because oil prices can go down as quickly 
as they went up cowper said 
also the huge prudhoe bay oil field the nations largest is 
in decline when it dries up so will alaskas free ride on oil 
the state has no state sales or income taxes 
its uncertain how next years new legislature will react to the 
windfall 
some lawmakers likely will push to deposit the cash in the 
alaska permanent fund an 112 billion state savings account 
funded with a fixed percentage of the states oil and mineral 
revenues since 1977 
but tapping that fund for future government expenses may be 
difficult the funds principal by law cannot be spent and theres 
strong public and political opposition to spending the earnings for 
other uses it also would reduce the size of dividends each alaskan 
receives every year from the fund 
past legislatures spent oil surpluses on roads sewers power 
projects buildings and other publi works projects in the young 
and largely undeveloped state 
the rationale will be hey weve got the money lets sow 
the seeds for the future while we can said sen pat pourchot 
a democrat 
but rep ramona barnes a republican predicted there will also 
be strong public pressure to save the cash 
the public is not going to stand for the legislature to just 
spend that money willynilly on everything that comes by she 
said theyre going to expect that money to be saved for a rainy 
day

a japanese cabinet official has apologized to the 
us ambassador for remarks in which he compared black americans to 
prostitutes the government said today 
justice minister seiroku kajiyama 64 visited us ambassador 
michael armacost thursday to convey his apology to the government 
and people of the united states the foreign ministry said in a 
statement 
the visit came in the wake of sharp criticism from the state 
department and american blacks after the newly appointed kajiyama 
said last friday that foreign prostitutes in tokyo ruin the 
atmosphere of the neighborhoods they move into 
its like in america where neighborhoods become mixed because 
blacks move in and whites are forced out kajiyama said 
the minister told armacost i have retracted the remarks and 
apologized to those concerned but again i would like to deeply 
apologize to your government and people and i would like you to 
convey my apology to your government and people 
in response armacost said the insensitivity of kajiyamas 
remarks had shocked all americans not just blacks 
the comments were only the latest by a japanese politician to 
provoke outrage from us minorities in 1986 for instance former 
prime minister yasuhiro nakasone precipitated an outpouring of 
criticism from the united states when he implied that blacks and 
hispanics had a low intellectual level 
on monday a state department said such remarks are offensive 
to the american people 
ralph neas executive director in washington of the leadership 
conference on civil rights called them reprehensible and 
racist 
a group of blacks living in japan released a statement of 
protest thursday and is also planning a demonstration in front of 
the justice ministry building next tuesday according to local news 
reports 
american blacks want to be friendly to japanese because we 
think japanese are also colored people but japanese see themselves 
as different they indulge in finding commonality between 
themselves and whites john russel an american researcher here 
told the asahi journal a liberal weekly magazine 
he said the japanese media has also contributed to creating a 
negative image of blacks as barbaric and superior only in sports 
and sex 
j r dash a foreign securities house employee in tokyo also 
told the asahi journal japanese are trying to get around the 
issue by stressing they dont understand minority problems because 
japan is an isolated island nation but ignorance should not be 
stressed as an excuse

presidents bushs handling of the persian 
gulf crisis has been endorsed in a resolution adopted by a house 
committee although the panel avoided approving any future military 
action 
the foreign affairs committees voice vote came thursday after 
three weeks of painstaking effort and in the wake of an earlier 
effort that unraveled amid fears that lawmakers might be issuing an 
implicit blank check for war 
the panel acted in a hastily called session after chairman dante 
fascell dfla worked out final details with presidents national 
security adviser brent scowcroft 
the full house is expected to consider the resolution on monday 
also on thursday a new 75 billion arms sale to saudi arabia 
proposed by the bush administration was gaining qualified support 
on capitol hill 
included in the saudi arms assortment is 150 advanced m1a2 
tanks six patriot antimissile batteries with 384 missiles a 
dozen apache groundattack helicopters with 155 hellfire missiles 
1750 improved tow antitank missiles with 150 launchers nine 
multiplelaunch rocket systems with 2880 rockets seven kc130 
tanker planes 10 c130 cargo planes and 10000 assorted trucks 
transporters and trailers 
in other congressional matters legislation that would provide 
about 400 million in special benefits for military personnel 
stationed in saudi arabia won senate armed services committee 
approval 
also contained in the bill is a provision setting up a system by 
which congress and bush administration officials would oversee and 
manage the expected donations from foreign governments to defray 
the cost of operation desert shield 
the committee in adopting the measure wanted to ensure that 
the pentagon couldnt go out and spend money on some weapons 
systems that are unrelated to desert shield without congressional 
approval said armed services committee chairman sam nunn dga 
among the benefits in the legislation are 11 million in free 
postage 265 million to make danger pay retroactive to aug 1 and 
12 million to compensate some people for leave they cannot take 
the pared down version of the legislation seemed less disturbing 
to supporters of israel than a previous 21 adaptation but there 
remained a few worries about some elements of the revised package 
it is a big improvement said rep mel levine dcalif but 
he said he planned to closely question administration officials 
about the tanks the apaches and the patriots at a hearing next 
week levine suggested some of the concerns might be calmed if the 
administration comes up with a counterbalancing security package 
for israel 
pentagon spokesman pete williams called the proposed saudi sale 
urgently needed 
contained in the immediate package are items deemed necessary to 
meet saudi defense needs in the current crisis including weapons 
that can be delivered from current stocks or quickly taken off the 
production line sources said the white house planned to send 
congress a followup request in late january for the other 14 
billion worth of weapons it believes the saudis need including 
newgeneration f15f fighter planes 
the house foreign affairs committee session broke up at one 
point when it appeared no agreement could be reached between 
committee democrats and the white house on a persian gulf 
resolution could be reached 
a primary hangup was lawmakers nervousness that any 
congressional resolution might be seen as implicitly endorsing any 
future use of force by the united states said rep lee hamilton 
dind 
as the resolution has gone through the drafting stages over the 
past three weeks there have been echoes of the tonkin gulf 
resolution a 1964 act that was seen as authorizing widening us 
involvement in vietnam 
fascell sought to make it clear that the document would only 
approve bushs actions so far in the gulf crisis and leave out any 
mention of next steps it voiced support for bushs emphasis on 
diplomatic efforts international sanctions and negotiations under 
the auspices of the united nations to achieve the goals of 
forcing iraq out of kuwait and restoring kuwaits previous 
government to power 
similar internal debates are under way on both sides of the 
capitol between those who believe congress should take a formal 
role in the gulf situation and those who prefer to keep their 
political distance from it

walter debow and his family fought 
city hall and now they own it 
debow 55 suffered permanent brain damage after being beaten 
into a coma by a fellow prisoner at the city jail more than six 
years ago he and his family were awarded 34 million in a 1985 
court settlement with the city 
with interest that amount has grown to 4 million and the 
debtridden city has not paid at least 1 million of it said the 
debows attorney clyde kuehn 
so on thursday judge roger scrivner of st clair county circuit 
court awarded the east st louis municipal building and 220 acres 
of cityowned property to the debows 
kuehn said the debows planned to sell the property definitely 
my clients want what they were awarded and i think this is 
necessary to accomplish that he said 
city officials estimated the municipal building alone cost 10 
million to build city attorney eric vickers said the value of the 
properties far exceeds anything owed the debows 
i think this decision is just a major miscarriage of justice 
and demonstrates bias against the city of east st louis vickers 
said the city has not defaulted on its payments its 
ludicrous 
another lawyer for east st louis irvin williamson said the 
city would ask a court to stay the judgment pending appeal 
if the court allows the judgment to stand against the city 
whats next the police cars the fire trucks williamson said 
east st louis is plagued by debt estimated at 47 million gov 
james r thompson signed a 34 million bailout bill aug 30 the 
money will come from state bond issues 
the population of the city which has one of the highest murder 
rates in the country fell from 55000 in 1980 to 40000 this year 
the census bureau estimates 
mayor carl e officer declined to comment on the judges order 
aldermen were flabbergasted 
its amazing said alderman percy mckinney i guess we pay 
rent from now on 
state law gives debows family the right to evict the city in 
seven days but kuehn said his clients werent likely to do that 
walter debow was comatose for three months following the january 
1984 beating which occurred while he was being held on a traffic 
charge of illegal transportation of alcohol he is being cared for 
at a headinjury rehabilitation center in new jersey 
kuehn has taken the city to court several times since debow was 
awarded the 4 million in march 1988 he won an order to freeze 
the citys assets stopping city workers paychecks and threatening 
to push the city into bankruptcy 
the city later tried to pay off the debt by issuing nearly 52 
million in bondsbut thursday kuehn said the actual value of the 
bonds was only 28 million prompting him to ask the judge to 
award the city property to debows estate to make up the 
difference 
debow also will continue to hold the bonds and receive biannual 
bond payments kuehn said

for occasional inquiries about missing americans at that time 
baker announced that the bush administration was withdrawing 
diplomatic recognition of the cambodian guerrilla coalition and 
opening negotiations with vietnam on settling the 11yearold civil 
war in cambodia 
while vietnam has heavily influenced the cambodian government 
cambodia has shown recent signs of pursuing a more independent 
course the guerrilla coalition includes the communist khmer rouge 
which killed at least 1 million cambodians when it ran the country 
in the late 1970s 
vietnamese troops ousted the khmer rouge in an invasion in 
december 1978 
the guerrillas and the cambodian government have been 
negotiating over formation of a supreme national council to run the 
warravaged country until an election can be held under a plan 
approved by the united nations 
the announcement said baker wanted to discuss formation of the 
council and its early assumption of its seat in the un 
however cambodian radio reported on wednesday that cambodian 
prime minister prime minister hun sen had rejected a proposal from 
the guerrilla coalition to install prince sihanouk as chairman in 
exchange for an additional seat for the hun sen government 
the report said that hun sen felt his government should be 
allotted the slot of deputy prime minister and that he had urged 
his forces to keep fighting against the guerrillas

warheads from areas of the country where there is a risk of ethnic 
unrest

officials tour of the united states

unions 30000 nuclear warhead arsenal was being relocated

the newspaper said western defense attaches believe central asia 
the southern transcaucasus region and the baltic republics are 
involved 
those areas have been the scene of sometimes violent ethnic and 
nationalist unrest in the past two years 
moiseyev said similar actions have been taken to ensure the 
security of nonnuclear weapons

a court today convicted 16 soldiers 
in the murder of president corazon aquinos husband but failed to 
say who ordered the assassination which set the stage for the 1986 
revolution 
the impact of the decision was further clouded by the courts 
acquittal of 20 people in the 1983 slaying of sen benigno 
ninoy aquino the countrys top opposition leader at the time 
other defendants including a former military chief of staff 
have fled the country to avoid prosecution 
the verdict in the 3year trial was announced on the first 
anniversary of the death of the late dictator ferdinand marcos who 
many filipinos believe ordered the aquinos slaying 
the assassination outraged many filipinos and heralded the 1986 
popular uprising that toppled marcos and catapulted mrs aquino to 
power 
the threejudge court sentenced the 16 convicted defendants to 
life imprisonment and ordered them to pay 300000 to the late 
senators heirs it was unclear if that figure is a total or if 
each defendant is expected to pay that sum 
aquino was cut down by gunfire on aug 21 1983 moments after 
returning from selfimposed exile in the united states to challenge 
marcos he had just stepped off a china airlines jet that brought 
him back to manila to challenge marcos for leadership of this 
nation 
i think not only i but the entire filipino people have been 
waiting for the decision of the court mrs aquino told reporters 
after todays verdict 
later she said she had become frustrated by the slow pace of 
the proceedings and as president would refrain from expressing my 
true feelings about the verdict 
marcos claimed aquino was slain by an alleged communist 
assassin rolando galman who was himself shot to death moments 
after aquino the 16 were also convicted in the slaying of galman 
marcos died in exile in hawaii on sept 28 1989 
the court said it could not convict ferdinand marcos and his 
wife imelda because there has been no evidence to prove a prima 
facie case against them 
those convicted included brig gen luther custodio former 
chief of the airport security command he is terminally ill with 
cancer the rest of the convicted were security guards on the 
tarmac of manilas airport when aquinos plane arrived 
chief defense lawyer rodolfo jimenez said the 16 would appeal to 
the supreme court 
among those acquitted were rep jose aspiras former tourism 
minister former air transport minister jose singson and col 
arturo custodio former commander of villamor air base 
in its summation the court said evidence pointed to constable 
1st class rogelio moreno one of the 16 convicted as the 
triggerman but the court noted that the broader question of who 
ordered the killing could not be answered 
following the verdict aquinos sister rep teresita oreta 
said she was disappointed that the court could not establish the 
mastermind 
i would have wanted a clearer statement on who ordered the 
killing she said these are soldiers who will not move without 
any orders 
twentysix people including former military chief of staff gen 
fabian ver were originally charged with the killing but acquitted 
in december 1985 by a court appointed by marcos 
six months after marcos was ousted the supreme court overturned 
the acquittals and ordered a new trial saying marcos engineered 
the original verdict 
the first trial was marked by frequent street demonstrations and 
rallies but the second attracted virtually no spectators apart 
from relatives of the accused newspapers rarely covered it 
the aquino case has often been cited as an example of the 
countrys inefficient judiciary midway during the proceedings the 
supreme court disbarred chief prosecutor raul gonzalez after he 
publicly charged justices were misappropriating funds 
one defendant died during the trial and three others including 
ver have fled the country philippine law does not permit trials 
in absentia 
during a coup attempt in december more than 12 of the 
defendants escaped from a military stockade but all eventually 
surrendered

hostages of a schizophrenic who hated 
americans and claimed to hear voices endured seven hours of bizarre 
conversations and gunfire in a hotel bar 
they also saw one of the hostages killed and seven other people 
wounded before the gunman died in an explosion of police bullets 
when he took a head count of us he started counting his rounds 
as well said doug moore among 33 people held by mehrdad dashti 
he watched every single move every time someone moved he 
flinched 
dashti 30 commandeered henrys publick house and grille at the 
durant hotel a block south of the university of californias 
berkeley campus early thursday 
the siege punctuated by dashtis gunfire and the escape of some 
hostages ended when police decided they could not talk him into 
coming out and stormed the bar 
dashti was described as a paranoid schizophrenic on an alameda 
county mental health form found in his cluttered berkeley 
apartment police knew of no clear motive for the attack 
he was apparently very confused said berkeley police capt 
phil doran deranged is not a bad description 
dashti who grew up in iran and came to the united states eight 
years ago expressed animosity toward americans 
the foreigners in there he told them he wasnt going to 
bother them he was after the americans moore said 
he claimed the government owed him 16 trillion for mental 
telepathy work and this was his way of getting it back said 
moore 25 a student at the nearby campus and manager of the hotel 
bar a popular gathering place for students 
dashti in an unmailed letter to president bush obtained by the 
san francisco examiner claimed to have spoken with invisible 
intelligent species from the world of the dead 
moore said dashti also disliked blond women during the ordeal 
dashti made them take off their pants but let them keep on their 
underwear hostages said 
carrying a briefcase dashti walked into henrys shortly before 
midnight and had a drink moore said moore made a last call 
and the remaining crowd of more than 40 people clustered at the 
bar 
there was a bang dashti had concealed a pistol a revolver and 
an assaulttype pistol in the briefcase police said moore 
said he looked up to see dashti point a gun into the crowd and fire 
several more shots 
i saw the gun and i hit the ground said john landa 21 who 
was shot in the right arm but escaped with several others 
san francisco police sgt jerry senkir said dashti was named in 
a march 1989 warrant charging grand theft in connection with 
cashing two checks worth more than 16000 stolen from a bakery 
dashtis roommate 19yearold fred smith described him as 
pretty religious and fond of guns 
john sheehy 22 of lafayette died after he was shot in the 
chest at close range the gunman allowed a man at the bar to carry 
him outside then ordered the others into strategic positions 
around the room 
during the next seven hours dashti terrified his hostages by 
shooting for the hell of it moore said he would say cover 
your heads and then shoot 
dashti used two male hostages as mouthpieces having them answer 
telephone calls from police trying to negotiate with him and shout 
his demands out the window 
one of his demands was that san francisco police chief frank 
jordan drop his drawers on television doran said moore said 
dashti had lots of negative things to say about san francisco 
police 
dashti who received a degree in engineering from san francisco 
state university also was upset he didnt get a student loan for 
uc berkeley police said 
the gunman who drank beer and whiskey suggested everyone have 
a drink and invited the hostages to talk about anything moore 
said 
dashti began a guessing game he thought up numbers between one 
and 15 and the others tried to guess moore said

agreement between britain and iran to resume 
diplomatic ties has raised hopes that british hostages in lebanon 
may be freed soon and that author salman rushdie can again live 
without fear of assassination 
the london newspaper the guardian today quoted unnamed british 
officials as saying that following thursdays announcement at the 
united nations of resumed ties rushdie should be able to resume a 
normal life without fear of being killed 
foreign secretary douglas hurd and irans un mission said the 
embassies will reopen in london and tehran within a month 
iran cut diplomatic ties with britain in march 1989 over 
rushdies novel the satanic verses which many moslems regard 
as blasphemous 
irans late religious leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini had 
called on moslems to kill the indianborn writer rushdie a 
naturalized briton remains in hiding under british police guard 
paul handley spokesman for archbishop of canterbury robert 
runcie leader of the church of england said the resumption of 
diplomatic ties between iran and britain was good news for the 
three british hostages 
runcies envoy terry waite was seized in january 1987 trying 
to negotiate the freedom of american hostages 
of course it does not mean all the problems are solved 
added handley but they will be much easier to solve through 
normal diplomatic channels 
pressure on britain to get talking to iran about waite and the 
two other hostages television journalist john mccarthy and 
retired fighter pilot jack mann increased this month with the 
release of irish teacher brian keenan 
it made britain the only western country which has so far failed 
to get a single hostage released from lebanon 
speaking on tvam this morning waites brother david called the 
move a major step forward which would allow problems between 
the two countries to be resolved more easily 
i just hope the families of all the other hostages dont have 
to cope much longer waite said 
coopers brother paul speaking on the same program called the 
restoration of ties very encouraging 
there has been an enormous amount of suspicion and hostility 
between britain and iran and its very important that these bridges 
are built and both sides start to trust each other he said 
another london newspaper the independent reported that 
following resumption of diplomatic ties between britain and iran 
britain is expected to raise with israeli the issue of shia 
prisoners in south lebanon 
the prisoners are held by the israelibacked south lebanese army 
in what the paper described as deplorable conditions 
iran says they are as much hostages as the 13 westerners 
including six americans held in lebanon the 13 are believed held 
by islamic fundamentalists loyal to irans shiite revolution 
the longestheld is terry anderson chief middle east 
correpondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
iran wanted relations with london as part of improving ties with 
the west and opening up trade channels 
britain wanted relations with iran partly because of the 
hostages and increasingly now because of the realignment in the 
middle east following iraqs seizure of kuwait aug 2

even the most veteran of smokers know their 
health could improve if they kick the habit federal researchers 
say 
the centers for disease control said thursday that 83 percent of 
smokers believe they could avoid health problems if they quit and 
85 percent believe there are health benefits for those who quit 
even after 20 or more years of smoking 
the figures were taken in a canvass of 4351 smokers ages 25 to 
64 during a random telephone survey conducted from january to 
april 1989 
the cdc reported that about 90 percent of collegeeducated 
smokers ages 55 to 64 indicated they believe there are health 
benefits for longterm smokers who quit 
knowledge of the advantages of not smoking was lowest in smokers 
in that age group who had no college education 67 percent of them 
said they saw a benefit to quitting late in life 
the survey was part of a battery of new studies intended to 
freshen decadesold warnings about smoking cdc officials said 
the overall message though wasnt new 
the research found that quitting smoking increases life 
expectancy said dr ronald davis director of the cdcs office 
on smoking and health in rockville md 
even though we knew quitting smoking was good for you we 
never really had an idea of how much the risk goes down after 
quitting davis said 
according to the cdc risks associated with smoking drop 
dramatically in some cases almost from the moment the last 
cigarette is snuffed out 
the atlantabased cdc concluded that smokers gain an average of 
5 pounds after quitting only 4 percent of those who quit gain more 
than 20 pounds 
the psychological effects of nicotine withdrawal irritability 
difficulty with concentration sleep disorders increased appetites 
and cigarette cravings peak after about two days then subside 
rapidly over the next several weeks he said 
we recognize that many smokers dont quit because they think 
they might gain some weight or suffer withdrawal davis said 
we are trying to get the message out that these effects go down 
very quickly so smokers should do all they can to get beyond those 
first two weeks and increase their chances of becoming permanent 
nonsmokers 
the cdc also cited a study of pregnant smokers in ohio which 
found that women who stopped smoking before pregnancy or during the 
first four months of pregnancy would have the same risk of 
delivering low birthweight babies as women who never smoked 
the cdc report came two days after surgeon general antonia c 
novello issued a report that said older smokers could increase 
their life expectancy and improve their health if they quit even 
after decades of smoking 
according to her report 50 million americans smoke or chew 
tobacco and 390000 die every year from smokingrelated diseases 
novello said about half of living americans who tried tobacco 
products have quit

giant balloons built by the french to hop 
slowly across mars surface during a soviet space mission are 
undergoing field tests in californias mojave desert 
the sixday series of lowaltitude tests being conducted by 
french soviet and us engineers started thursday over dry 
lakebeds lava and boulder fields and sand dunes near barstow and 
desert center 
tests were scheduled today on lava fields about 40 miles 
southeast of barstow after the successful halfmile test thursday 
on flat coyote dry lake 
its a test of the system to see if it works over marslike 
terrain said harris schurmeier retired associate director of 
the nasas jet propulsion laboratory and mars balloon project 
manager for the planetary society 
the delicate balloon was intentionally destroyed after the test 
the french brought about 10 balloons for the test flights 
schurmeier said 
the 30foottall 10footwide cylindrical balloons will be 
aboard two spacecraft the soviets plan to launch into orbit around 
mars in a 1994 mission schurmeier said 
each orbiter will deploy an entry capsule which will parachute 
toward the red planet the fourth from the sun before landing 
each capsule will deploy a balloon 
the resuls are very good said christian tarrieu mars 
balloon project manager for the national center for space studies 
in france 
the transparent mylar balloons are designed to explore a large 
area of mars without having to negotiate difficult terrain the 
balloons are filled with helium and nitrogen so they act as both 
gas and hotair balloons 
during the day the sun heats up gas in the balloon and the 
whole thing lifts off the ground schurmeier said then the 
winds blow it around when it cools at night it goes back toward 
the ground 
he said the french and soviets hope the balloons will operate 
for 10 days the life of the batteries they will carry covering 
a distance of 600 to 900 miles 
a gondola hanging beneath each balloon probably will carry a 
television camera and instruments to measure atmospheric 
temperature humidity and clarity schurmeier said

a federal jury believed a hot burst from a 
caesars palace steam bath kept rodney dangerfield from performing 
at the casinohotel and awarded the comic 725000 
the truth won out dangerfield said i wouldnt have gone 
through this unless i was right 
dangerfields bitter legal battle with the las vegas resort 
culminated thursday when jurors said caesars was responsible for a 
march 1988 steam bath accident that left him unable to perform 
because of eye injuries 
were very disappointed said bruce aguilera a lawyer for 
caesars palace well have to have our lawyers look at the 
case 
jurors awarded dangerfield 500000 for pain and suffering and 
225000 for shows he missed after the march 1988 accident 
dangerfield sued caesars for 5 million in damages and 225000 for 
missed performances 
the bugeyed comic who has made a career out of the premise 
that he receives no respect thanked jurors outside a court 
elevator 
we showed rodney some respect an unidentified juror said 
the jury said caesars was obligated under a contract to pay 
dangerfield for the missed shows because the injury should have 
excused him from performing jurors also rejected caesars 100000 
countersuit against its former headliner 
dangerfield 68 criticized caesars for filing papers in court 
before the trial accusing him of drug use he called the 
accusations nonsense and untrue 
im surprised they went to that level to degrade me falsely 
like they did he said all they did in this entire trial was 
to try to degrade my character 
i wasnt concerned with the amount of money he said 
money is money i was concerned about the truth 
dangerfield said henry gluck chairman of the resorts parent 
caesars world inc had refused to settle for 225000 
dangerfield missed five shows the week of the accident claiming 
caesars was negligent in installing and maintaining a steam bath he 
used immediately after his performances 
the hotel in its countersuit claimed dangerfield breached his 
contract by not performing shows as scheduled and contended during 
the 2weeklong trial that the comedian showed no signs of 
permanent injury from the accident 
dangerfield testified he was hit in the eyes by a burst of steam 
as he opened the door to the steam room 
caesars introduced evidence that dangerfield went out two nights 
he was supposed to perform a doctor who examined dangerfield after 
the steam bath incident said he thought dangerfield could perform 
but an ophthalmologist hired by dangerfields attorneys said he 
examined dangerfield three times in the last year and concluded he 
continues to suffer pain caused by the steam injury

opposition leaders say theyll try to stop prime 
minister brian mulroneys move to pack the canadian senate with 
eight new members in an attempt to ram through a proposed 7 percent 
sales tax 
manufacturers say the new tax would replace one that hurts their 
competitiveness with imports but liberal leader jean chretien said 
thursday that canadians will not back mulroney whose popularity 
has dipped sharply in polls 
when you are 15 percent in the polls and taking an abuse of 
power and stacking the senate he might find that he will not go 
very far politically with that said chretien 
mulroney used an obscure constitutional provision to seat the 
new senators of his conservative party late thursday after 
receiving permission from queen elizabeth ii the new members take 
their seats next week 
the appointees who serve until age 75 bring the senate to 112 
seats mulroneys party now has 54 seats just three short of a 
majority 
consumers already paying 8 percent to 10 percent in provincial 
sales taxes are horrified at the prospect of seeing higher taxes 
on their purchases plumbing bills haircuts and music lessons 
but manufacturers favor the new 7 percent tax because it would 
replace a 13 percent levy on canadian industries 
the old tax was a longstanding source of competitive 
disadvantage for canadian manufacturers exporters and all 
businesses that compete with imports in the domestic canadian 
market business leaders say 
a freetrade pact with the united states that went into effect 
last year has raised concerns that some canadian businesses could 
be hurt by increased competition from companies over the border 
the nations 1867 constitution allows the british monarch to add 
four or eight members to the senate on a request by the 
governorgeneral the canadian representative to the commonwealth 
the only other similar request was in 1873 but it was not granted 
mulroney used the measure as a last resort to save the goods and 
services tax which has been stalled in the liberaldominated 
senate the commons dominated by conservatives supported the tax 
mulroney said the debate goes beyond the tax proposal itself 
arguing that the elected commons should prevail over the appointed 
senate 
the consequences for our parliamentary system are enormous 
he said what is at stake is one of the principles of our 
freedom 
john haslam a spokesman for the queen said elizabeth as the 
constitutional monarch of the former british colony followed the 
provisions of the canadian constitution in making the decision 
but even with the additional seats the fate of the tax could 
rest on the votes of a handful of independents 
before mulroneys move the liberals held 52 seats and the 
conservatives 46 with one reform party representative four 
independents and one independent liberal the 46 conservative 
seats combined with the eight new seats still only make a total 
of 54 three votes short of a majority 
over the last two months mulroney has filled 15 senate 
vacancies with conservative loyalists to narrow the gap

decree by the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini against british 
writer salman rushdie khomeini said rushdie defamed islam in his

leading japanese lawmakers and north koreas ruling 
party agreed today that the two countries should begin formal 
negotiations in november to establish diplomatic ties 
the joint declaration signed in pyongyang north koreas 
capital marked a sharp departure from the norths past policy of 
opposition to ties with countries that recognize rival south korea 
south koreas foreign ministry today reacted with caution to the 
news of improving relations between japan and north korea 
officials said they welcomed a liberalization of the norths 
isolationist policy but said japanese moves to strengthen ties 
should be made slowly and in consultation with south korea 
some observers have suggested north koreas move to establish 
relations with japan might have been triggered by south koreas 
steps toward ties with the soviet union a close ally of north 
korea 
normalization of ties by tokyo and pyongyang would end 45 years 
of estrangement between japan and north korea beginning at the end 
of world war ii when the peninsula was divided 
south korea normalized relations with japan in 1965 
the joint communique came at the end of five days of talks in 
north korea between the japanese lawmakers group and north korean 
officials including president kim il sung the talks were the 
highestlevel discussions ever by the two countries 
the japanese delegation made up of lawmakers from japans 
governing and largest opposition parties agreed that tokyo should 
pay compensation to north korea for its past colonial rule over the 
korean peninsula japanese and north korean news reports said 
although the discussions were between north korean and japanese 
political parties rather than their governments the communique is 
believed to represent a commitment by both sides 
the japanese group was headed by former deputy prime minister 
shin kanemaru a powerful leader of the governing liberal 
democratic party and by japan socialist party vice chairman makoto 
tanabe 
the socialists have served as a bridge between the two nations 
in the absence of formal diplomatic relations 
during the talks kim agreed to release two japanese seamen 
detained since 1983 on espionage charges removing a key impediment 
to relations north korean officials said thursday the two men will 
be freed in october japans kyodo news service reported 
todays declaration said the two countries should quickly 
establish satellite communications links and direct air flights to 
help improve relations the two countries now have no direct 
telephone mail or travel connections 
the joint declaration also called for an end to discrimination 
against koreans living in japan and for peaceful unification of 
north and south korea through dialogue between the divided nations

the governments main economic forecasting 
gauge in august sank 12 percent in the wake of the persian gulf 
crisis the government said today it was the steepest drop since 
the month following the 1987 stock market crash 
the commerce departments index of leading economic indicators 
had been unchanged in the month prior to the aug 2 iraqi invasion 
of kuwait 
since then however an already sluggish economy has shown signs 
of further weakening as oil prices more than doubled slowing both 
sales and production both consumer confidence and the stock market 
also have plunged 
the august decline was the first in four months and the sharpest 
since a 14 percent fall in november 1987 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks plummeted 508 
points a month earlier on oct 19 the 226 percent drop was the 
biggest percentage decline in stock market history other stock 
indices also fell sharply 
the index is designed to forecast economic activity six to nine 
months in advance three consecutive declines in the gauge are 
viewed as a fairly reliable although not infallible signal that 
the economy is headed for a recession 
a survey of the nations top economic forecasters in late august 
and early september showed they were growing more pessimistic about 
chances the economy could avoid a recession in the next 12 months 
indeed some believed the downturn already has begun 
up until now a large majority of nabe forecasters have 
expected the expansion to last through 1990 and 1991 the 
national association of business economists said in a report on the 
survey 
but this prospect is now in jeopardy it continued 
although the median forecast shows positive real growth in both 
1990 and 1991 the pace is slow enough to make two quarters of 
decline in a row the informal definition of recession a 
distinct possibility 
seven of the forwardlooking indicators dragged the index under 
in august they were a drop in an index measuring consumer 
confidence declining stock prices falling orders for new plants 
and equipment a decrease in unfilled orders a rise in weekly 
unemployment claims a drop in building permits and a fall in the 
money supply 
the only positive contributors were slower business delivery 
times an increase in orders for consumer goods a longer workweek 
and an increase in the price of raw materials 
the various changes left the index at 1442 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 and down 04 percent from its level a year ago 
if a recession could be avoided through november the economic 
expansion will have reached its eighth anniversary it already is 
the nations longest in peacetime 
and if it lasted until october 1991 it would set a new overall 
record of us economic growth surpassing the 106 months of 
continuing expansion between february 1961 and december 1969 
just four months ago the nabe survey found 82 percent of the 68 
professional forecasters surveyed in april and may saying the 
business expansion would continue through next year 
but in answer to the question what is the probability of a 
recession within the next 12 months the new survey found the 
median probability of recession has jumped to 50 percent from prior 
readings which have been in the 2030 percent zone 
the latest survey of 71 forecasters also found 60 percent 
anticipating a recession within three years 
of those 76 percent believe it has already begun in the 
second or third quarter or will begin imminently in the fourth 
quarter or the first three months of 1991 the report said 
of course information and conditions are changing rapidly as 
this analysis is prepared the nabe economists said indeed on 
tuesday the same day the survey results were released the 
government sharply revised secondquarter economic growth down from 
an annual rate of 12 percent to a barely perceptible 04 percent 
but even before that change the survey showed the forecasters 
already had shaved their estimate of economic growth for 1990 from 
20 percent in may to 12 percent in august and for 1991 from 24 
percent four months ago to 14 percent last month 
other highlights of the survey projected 
inflation as measured by the consumer price index would rise 
53 percent in 1990 compared to 47 percent in the preoilprice 
shock poll the 1991 forecast is for a 49 percent increase up 
from 43 percent in the may survey inflation for all of 1989 was 
46 percent 
the merchandise trade deficit would improve from 1094 billion 
in 1989 to 95 billion this year and 90 billion in 1991 
the federal budget deficit would total 225 billion including 
the cost of the savings and loan bailout in 1990 and 240 billion 
in 1991 the 1989 deficit was 1520 billion

four avantgarde theater performers are suing 
the national endowment for the arts contending they were denied 
funds for political reasons 
karen finley and holly hughes of new york john fleck of los 
angeles and tim miller of santa monica filed a lawsuit in federal 
court thursday asking for the 23000 grants for which they applied 
or at least review of their applications 
the suit filed on the artists behalf by the american civil 
liberties union claims the nea violated their first amendment 
rights by denying their applications for impermissible political 
reasons 
josh dare a spokesman for the nea said today that the agency 
had no immediate comment on the suit 
grants for the performance artists known as the nea four in 
arts circles received unanimous approval in february from a peer 
review board 
but nea chairman john e frohnmayer vetoed the grants on june 
29 and last month rejected appeals of his decision by the artists 
he was named as a defendant 
when frohnmayer vetoed the four grants he refused to give any 
reasons citing a longstanding policy against discussing grant 
rejections 
in an unusual departure from that policy late in august the nea 
issued a statement saying that frohnmayer decided against giving 
the four grants because the artists work would not enhance 
public understanding and appreciation of the arts 
congress at the urging of sen jesse helms rnc last year 
amended the nea appropriations bill for the current fiscal year to 
prohibit federal support for works that may be deemed obscene 
the action came after controversy arose over exhibits by artists 
such as the late photographer robert mapplethorpe whose work 
included sexual themes 
the four who sued thursday each of whom had received nea grants 
in the past do monologues and other stage routines that generally 
deal with politics racism and sexual oppression and frequently 
include strong sexual content 
the performers had been singled out by conservative members of 
congress as examples of the neas willingness to subsidize works 
that might be offensive

irancontra prosecutor lawrence e walsh says 
he wants to complete his investigation of the reagan 
administrations worst scandal by next spring but indicates he 
might bring more charges in the meantime 
walsh held out the possibility thursday that his office could 
seek more criminal indictments in the continuing investigation of 
the coverup of usiran arms deals and the secret delivery of 
military aid to the nicaraguan rebels 
the independent counsel acknowledged that the heavy expense 
of the probe would be a factor in deciding how far to press the 
almost 4yearold investigation walshs office has spent more than 
21 million 
but he said he could not foresee closing his office until after 
an appeals court rules probably next spring on the convictions of 
former national security adviser john m poindexter 
ideally the work of the office except for possible appeals 
and the trial of any outstanding indictments should be completed 
shortly after this decision walsh said 
during the intervening months our investigation should be 
completed he said in the text of a speech at washburn university 
in topeka kan 
but walsh indicated that new charges may be brought by the grand 
jury which sources say is examining the role of reagan 
administration officials in trying to cover up the irancontra 
affair 
if there should be further prosecutions they will be pressed 
without delay he said 
he said his staff had recently obtained new records of the 
irancontra affair 
also certain witnesses are available now who were not 
available during earlier stages of the investigation walsh said 
in an apparent reference to poindexter and former white house aide 
oliver north 
since their convictions both men have testified before the 
grand jury which continues to meet periodically 
walshs efforts will be largely focused on defending the 
convictions of poindexter and north 
the independent counsel recently asked a federal appeals court 
here to reconsider its july 20 decision to set aside norths three 
felony convictions pending a hearing on whether norths 
congressional testimony had unfairly tainted his trial 
north and poindexter both testified before congress under 
immunity grants that barred prosecutors from using their testimony 
as evidence against them 
in his speech walsh blamed those grants for delaying his 
investigation by more than a year 
poindexter and north could have been tried together but 
because of problems related to immunity the trial court held 
that they must be tried separately he said 
poindexter recently appealed his sixmonth jail sentence for 
lying to lawmakers and obstructing congressional inquiries into the 
irancontra affair 
walsh responded to critics who have argued that he was 
prosecuting officials for involvement in a political dispute with 
congress over foreign policy 
he contended that the prosecutions were necessary to punish 
government officials who had illegally withheld information from 
congress 
if congress as a body asks for information it is entitled 
to information and to the extent possible accurate information 
walsh said 
when lawmakers asked about reports the reagan administration was 
secretly aiding the contra rebels in defiance of a congressional 
ban the executive did not have the privilege of lying as a 
tactic to achieve a political end walsh said 
such deception was held by trial judges to be a crime he said 
walshs remarks indicated that his original timetable for 
concluding the investigation had been extended six months 
following poindexters conviction in april walsh had said he 
hoped to make that decision by this fall the irancontra 
investigation which began in late 1986 has resulted in eight 
convictions

crude prices topped 40 a barrel for the first 
time despite president bushs attempt to soothe oil markets by 
selling government reserves 
analysts said heightened tension thursday in the persian gulf 
helped counter bushs decision to sell 5 million barrels of crude 
from the strategic petroleum reserve 
the november contract traded thursday for light sweet crude 
rose 87 cents to settle at 3954 a barrel on the new york 
mercantile exchange after trading as high as 4010 
it was the first time oil prices on the futures exchange passed 
the 40abarrel mark each barrel holds 42 gallons 
in early trading this morning oil prices were narrowly lower 
the november contract for light sweet crude was off 29 cents at 
3925 a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange by midmorning 
bush said wednesday that he was dipping into the nations 
reserves of 590 million barrels to counter speculators who have 
driven up the price of crude despite adequate supplies prices have 
doubled since the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait 
the president succeeded only temporarily prices dropped on 
overseas markets thursday and crude opened at 3767 a barrel in 
new york but persian gulf developments prompted panic buying 
william byers an oil market analyst with bear stearns amp co 
called news from the middle east more than an offsetting 
penalty to bushs announcement 
he also said many traders viewed thursdays incident involving 
the iraqi tanker tadmur as an offensive measure by the baghdad 
government designed to increase tensions in the gulf 
the pentagon said a team from a us warship in the red sea 
boarded the tanker after firing warning shots when orders to stop 
were ignored the tadmur was allowed to proceed after it was found 
to be empty the pentagon said 
analysts said the market continued to be hypersensitive to any 
rumors or reports that indicate military action is brewing that 
could cut off output from saudi arabia the biggest producer in the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries 
there also was some skepticism in the market about whether bush 
is serious about holding down oil prices by dipping into the 
nations reserves 
it may be more an attempt to show the electorate five weeks 
before the elections that hes trying to do something and is 
concerned said peter beutel an oil market analyst at pegasus 
econometric group inc in hoboken nj 
but beutel said sales from the nations reserves may yet have an 
impact on the market 
over time as people start to lose interest in pursuing the 
bear market to an end it could be a moderating influence on 
prices he said 
meanwhile prices for refined products also continued to climb 
thursday 
home heating oil for delivering in october rose 180 cents to 
10437 a gallon and prices for wholesale unleaded regular gasoline 
jumped 259 cents to 10269 a gallon 
the change in seasons is also a factor in heating oil prices 
however prices always advance as colder weather approaches

socalled oscar robertson suit in 1976 which paved the way to 
free agency in the league the nba and its players association also 
reached a collective bargaining agreement 
he also supervised the nbas merger with the rival american 
basketball association as a result the four strongest teams from 
the aba were absorbed into the nba the move ended costly feuding 
between the two leagues 
in 1983 obrien and the nba seemed headed toward a crisis as 
the playoffs approached so the did the possibility of a players

spend on salaries and benefits in return for which the players 
were guaranteed 53 percent of the gross revenues of the league the

east germanys parliament decided today to go 
out of business in a blaze of candor by revealing the names of 
lawmakers who worked for the communist secret police 
soon afterward construction minister axel viehweger resigned 
from the cabinet of prime minister lothar de maiziere and admitted 
he had contacts to the former secret police under the old regime 
lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to instruct a commission 
investigating the former security apparatus to disclose the names 
of former agents it has compiled 
before releasing the names the lawmakers gave officials on the 
list a chance to address the allegations before parliament 
viehweger did and promptly resigned he said he had contacts 
with the secret police while he was on the energy council in the 
city of dresden during the former regime 
ten other members of de maizieres 24member cabinet have 
stepped down because of political feuds philosophical differences 
or incompetence 
other lawmakers trooped to the microphone to describe what they 
said were contacts with the secret police that they said were 
required under the old regime 
eberhard schiffner a christian democrat said he was the head 
of a state veterinarian practice in 1963 and had to give 
information about his practice to the secret police 
a member of the secret police committee lawmaker peter 
hildebrand said 56 lawmakers or ministers in the current 
government were informally employed by the secret police unit 
known as the stasi 
the meeting of the 400member parliament was the secondtolast 
before the nation unites with west germany on tuesday and east 
germanys government ceases to exist 
this parliament must not go down in history as the stasi 
parliament said lawmaker marianne birthler calling for full 
disclosure of information gathered by the committee 
the nation has been obsessed with how to purge the tens of 
thousands of former stasi informants and agents from influential 
roles in politics and business 
the stasi many of whose members held other jobs they used as a 
cover helped keep the former hardline communist regime in power 
through stifling surveillance intimidation and purportedly murder 
because they and other elite members of the old regime had 
access to power connections and money they were able to maintain 
some control of the nation after a new inexperienced democratic 
government was elected in march 
there have been reports that many former functionaries and stasi 
agents are running businesses that were once stateowned but have 
now been freed to operate as private enterprises

the united states and 20 other industrialized 
nations laid plans today to try to protect the west from a 
potential oil supply crisis but said there was no immediate need to 
tap strategic reserves to offset the loss of oil from iraq and 
kuwait 
the international energy agency said that eight weeks after 
iraqs invasion of kuwait oil markets remain adequately supplied 
and no product shortages have materialized in member countries 
after a closeddoor meeting governing board members of the 
agency urged in a communique that member countries intensify energy 
conservation and efficiency measures 
they also urged governments to allow the full increase in oil 
prices to pass through to the market and suggested flexibility 
in the area of environmental regulations 
the communique called on all member countries to take all 
decisions necessary in order to be able to act immediately and 
effectively if need be 
if a significant shortfall of oil supplies develops the board 
will convene an emergency session it said the governing board 
will reconvene sometime during october regardless of whether an 
emergency becomes necessary 
oil companies were advised to continue drawing on commercial 
stocks and to use discretion in purchases to minimize volatility in 
the world oil market 
echoing the conclusion of the boards aug 31 meeting the 
communique said recent oil price rises were driven by extreme 
political uncertainty not by actual shortages 
in new york today oil prices were narrowly lower in quiet early 
trading today after briefly topping the 40abarrel mark on 
thursday the november contract for light sweet crude was off 29 
cents at 3925 a 42gallon barrel on the new york mercantile 
exchange by midmorning 
the agencys members include japan australia new zealand 
canada most western european countries and the united states 
which this week decided to tap its strategic petroleum reserves for 
this first time in response to the gulf crisis 
most official western oil stocks are held by the united states 
japan and west germany but the energy agency made no call for the 
germans and japanese to emulate the united states 
president bush on wednesday ordered the sale of 5 million 
barrels of oil from the us strategic reserve which contains 590 
million barrels of oil 
bush administration officials said the move was a test to see if 
the system could work in an emergency some us officials have 
advocated similar action from west germany with 197 million 
barrels of reserves and japan with 215 million barrels 
sheik ahmed zaki yamani the former saudi arabian oil minister 
and onetime chief opec strategist said high oil prices were due to 
the failure of leading oil companies and western countries to use 
reserves 
if oil companies were will to destock and draw from their 
inventories we could reduce the price of oil the british 
newspaper financial times quoted him as saying 
he said the tapping of strategic reserves by governments would 
be ineffective unless oil companies cut stocks

the us ambassador to bolivia said today 
a jailed former interior minister had ordered his assassination in 
revenge for the envoys role in bringing him to justice 
the former minister luis arce gomez is in jail in miami 
awaiting trial on drugtrafficking charges neither his attorney 
nor the prosecutor were immediately available for comment on the 
ambassadors allegation 
the ambassador robert s gelbard said he believed the former 
minister ordered paramilitary forces in bolivia to kill him 
because i was instrumental with the cooperation of the bolivian 
government in getting luis arce gomez to miami 
according to the us embassy the information about the 
assassination order was provided by highranking bolivian antidrug 
officials and was being taken very seriously 
the embassy said arce gomez called on members of the neonazi 
paramilitary group lovers of death or novios de la muerte to kill 
the ambassador no such attack has been made 
the group was set up by arce gomez in 1979 to help plan and 
carry out the bloody july 1980 military coup that interrupted 
democratic rule in the country 
the group was advised by nazi war criminal klaus barbie who was 
expelled from bolivia in 1983 and is now serving a life sentence 
for war crimes in lyon france 
arce gomez became the countrys highestranking law enforcement 
official after the coup but he provided protection to traffickers 
the us drug enforcement administration says and was known as the 
minister of cocaine arce gomez was arrested by bolivian police 
and us drug agents on dec 10 1989 and extradited to the united 
states by order of president jaime paz zamora

a benefit concert for abortion rights 
candidates featuring bonnie raitt robin williams and others was 
abruptly canceled after the veterans administration said its 
theater could not be used 
the oct 4 show which also was to include singers rickie lee 
jones and melissa etheridge was called off by organizers this 
week 
when i found out about this i was completely shocked i had 
to sit down and collect myself margery tabankin executive 
director of the hollywood womens committee said thursday 
the group a political action committee that works on mostly 
liberal issues hoped to raise 200000 from the invitationonly 
concert 
tabankin said the committee got permission in july to use the 
vas wadsworth theater from the university of california los 
angeles which sublets it 
she said ucla allowed the concert because it was to be a private 
fundraiser not a publicly advertised concert the tickets were 
sold to people on a committee mailing list 
but va spokesman joe barison said federal guidelines prohibit 
partisan political events public or private on va property 
they ucla officials made the commitment they shouldnt 
have and they acknowledged it barison said its just an 
honest error anyone could have made 
ucla officials said they were unaware of the concerts purpose 
until this week 
but tabankin said the committee clearly outlined the nature of 
the event we even told them the entire hallway would be filled 
with campaign posters she said our name is the hollywood 
womens political committee what did they think we are a canasta 
club 
the committee had already spent 37000 on the show but it 
hopes to recoup losses and even make money because many donors were 
declining to take refunds ticket prices ranged from 100 to 
1000

the house passed friday a 44 billion 
threeyear spending authorization bill for nasa that includes 
president bushs proposal to place a settlement on the moon and 
begin work on a manned expedition to mars 
the national aeronautics and space administration bill includes 
no money for the moon and mars program in the next fiscal year but 
would spend 444 million to begin it in fiscal 1992 and 649 
million in fiscal 1993 
the bill won approval on a voice vote after a brief debate it 
goes to a conference committee to work out differences with the 
senate 
the bill provides a threeyear spending authorization to enable 
nasa to make longerrange plans including space shuttle missions 
space exploration and development of expendable launch vehicles and 
an experimental highspeed aerospace plane 
the house passed a multiyear authorization last year but the 
senate never took action 
president bush proposed last year that nasa establish a 
permanent settlement on the moon and begin a 30year project to 
send a manned expedition to mars by the year 2019 the bill 
authorizes the bush administrations request for the projects 
start 
the bill authorizes total nasa spending of 14 billion in fiscal 
1990 144 billion in fiscal 1992 and 161 billion in fiscal 
1993 but if added to previous bills nasa authorized spending 
would be almost 17 billion in fiscal 1991 nearly 2 billion more

an immediate loss of us bases in the 
philippines would cause tremendous economic harm in a country that 
now needs an additional 1 billion to 2 billion as a result of the 
persian gulf crisis a top philippine official said friday 
financial secretary jesus estanislao said president corazon 
aquino has told him to get involved in talks over the future of 
clark air base subic bay naval base and four smaller facilities 
the meetings are expected to resume next month in manila 
us negotiators have indicated a phaseout or sharp reduction of 
the us presence is possible and philippine foreign secretary 
raul manglapus has said the country wants an immediate us pullout 
from clark air base when the current lease expires nxt september 
the shortterm misbenefit to filipinos for an immediate cutoff 
would be tremendous estanislao said in answer to a question at a 
news conference 
estanislao said the talks are covering a wide range of 
usphilippine issues including the possibility of debt reduction 
in place of some direct payment if us use of the facilities is 
continued 
he said assessments have been made of the impact of a loss of 
the bases but he declined to give figures he said the figures 
were not very precise but the country has contingency plans for the 
bases 
internationalism has advantages and isolation has its costs 
estanislao said 
members of the us congress familiar with the negotiations have 
said they expect the united states to seek agreement to rent some 
key facilities if a phaseout is necessary 
estanislao said it is important that the talks conclude 
successfully because it would be a very bad signal to investors 
if they end with acrimony between the two sides 
the financial secretary said increasing oil prices have not yet 
been fully felt in manila because the country is still running on 
oil purchased prior to iraqs aug 2 takeover of kuwait 
but he said the need for additional funds because of the crisis 
is expected to be between 1 billion and 2 billion depending on 
the price of oil 
the challenges for us seem to get bigger by the day no thanks 
to saddam hussein he said referring to the leader of iraq the 
country also has suffered a major earthquake drought and massive 
flooding in recent weeks 
the philippines also is hit by the loss of foreign exchange from 
thousands of filipino workers in iraq and kuwait and the need to 
give them jobs when they return 
estanislao said major economic goals for the country include 
giving more assistance to small and mediumsized businesses rather 
than larger privilegeseeking industries and narrowing the gap 
between the 68 percent interest paid to savers and the 2230 
percent charged to borrowers in by philippine banks 
before the gulf crisis and recent calamities the economy was 
growing at an annual rate of 6 percent and inflations was below 10 
percent a year estanislao said 
he said the country is getting from 25 billion to 3 billion 
under a multilateral assistance program for 1990 and expects an 
increase in 1991 but officials said the money needed as a result 
of the gulf crisis is in addition to those funds which are for 
economic development

the president of soviet kazakhstan asked the 
kremlin on friday to declare an ecological disaster in part of his 
republic following a sept 12 explosion at a nuclear fuel factory 
released a cloud of toxic gas tass reported 
the blast and fire at the ulbinsky metallurgical plant in a 
workshop using beryllium spewed the toxic gas that affected a 
considerable part of the population of ustkamenogorsk a city in 
eastern kazakhstan near the border with china and mongolia the 
official news agency said 
the public of kazhakstan and population of the city demand 
urgent measures to improve the situation and they demand 
compensation for damage to their health said a telegram sent by 
nursultan nazarbayev president of the republic to soviet prime 
minister nikolai ryzhkov 
nazarbayev also asked that a group of soviet experts be sent to 
ustkamenogorsk to decide on the continued operation of the plant 
and he requested an investigation by independent international 
ecological experts tass reported 
he was quoted as saying in the telegram that local authorities 
had already declared the region an ecological disaster zone 
several people were injured in the blast there was no report of 
any radiation release 
the plant is one of the largest producers of fuel for nuclear 
power plants in the soviet union and is situated in a densely 
populated part of ustkamenogorsk tass said 
after the explosion and fire the toxic gas filled the streets 
and dissipated slowly because of calm wind conditions preliminary 
tests showed twice the permitted levels of beryllium in air and 
water samples 
beryllium is a very light metal that can catch fire easily and 
burn like a magnesium flash vaporizing and releasing a deadly 
smoke of beryllium oxide 
ustkamenogorsk a city of about 20000 people is located in 
the altai mountains about 100 miles east of semipalatinsk where 
the soviet union conducts its nuclear weapons tests 
residents have campaigned against the nuclear tests and there 
have not been any for months

involved in the accident were hiding documents to avoid blame

the royal shakespeare company whose plays about 
the lives deaths and treacheries of english monarchs have 
intrigued millions has turned to gorbachev and glasnost and it 
looks like a flop 
moscow gold which opened in london this week with actor 
david calder a lookalike of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
in the lead role was mostly panned by the critics 
the companys productions of shakespeare history plays like 
richard ii are still performed to packed houses but it is on 
shakier ground with one of the biggest reallife dramas of the 
twentieth century 
the whole thing is best forgotten as im sure it will be 
jack tinker in the daily mail wrote of the play cowritten by 
britons howard brenton and pakistanborn tariq ali 
moscow gold opened wednesday at the companys barbican 
theater where it runs in repertory through nov 5 initial 
performances have played to about 60 percent attendance in the 
1162seat auditorium 
its the authors second collaboration last years iranian 
nights was a response to the death threat against salman 
rushdie the indianborn british writer for his novel the 
satanic verses 
we started thinking what else we could collaborate on ali 
47 said in an interview before the press night one of us said 
it would be great to put glasnost and gorbachev on stage and we 
looked at each other and screamed with laughter thinking it was 
too ambitious an idea 
ali said of moscow gold that all the world is in there 
humor farce tragedy and very very serious dialogue 
the critics largely disagreed 
benedict nightingale in the times of london called the episodic 
threehour drama a pretty flaccid history lesson and faulted 
its lumpish dialogue 
milton shulman in the evening standard said the play would draw 
audiences who want instant history served up as sketchy cartoons 
or dramatized captions but he admired actor calder as an 
impressive gorbachev clone 
of the initial reviews only the financial timess malcolm 
rutherford was enthusiastic he called the play a huge success 
a most unusual triumph praising calder as the very image 
of gorbachev 
directed by barry kyle on stefanos laziridiss busy 
constructivist sets moscow gold features a cast of 33 playing 
57 characters 
sara kestelman costars as raisa gorbachev who is seen in 
yellow pajamas and a fur coat singing a ditty about her life as a 
simple soviet girl 
later the couple lie in bed discussing the movie 
ghostbusters and the prospect of a film of their lives with 
robert redford and meryl streep 
alongside the facetiousness is a somewhat didactic history 
lesson about the threats to socialism throughout this century 
company veterans clive merrison russell dixon and clifford 
rose play such figures as vladimir ilyich lenin architect of the 
russian revolution boris yeltsin the maverick politician and 
former soviet leader yuri andropov 
other characters include a chorus of kremlin cleaning ladies 
chernobyl man a survivor of the 1986 nuclear disaster and white 
house astrologer rona anderson played in drag by american craig 
pinder 
calder 44 said his resemblance to gorbachev was just a lucky 
coincidence 
this isnt a sort of mechanical imitation he said were 
striving to get the theatricality and the content of gorbachevs 
life not a sort of correct portrayal of it 
to date the gorbachevs have not responded to invitations to 
attend the production ali said raisa was a great fan of the 
royal shakespeare company in any event

a voucher system to ensure that welfare 
payments are used for housing and other necessities won 
overwhelming approval by county supervisors 
the milwaukee county program would require direct payment of 
housing and utility bills through vouchers electronic fund 
transfers or third parties for recipients of aid to families with 
dependent children 
the board of supervisors voted 222 thursday to seek state and 
federal approval required for the plan to take effect an amendment 
also approved thursday calls for providing recipients with an 
unspecified small amount of discretionary cash 
what were concerned about in milwaukee is that the money is 
used for what its intended which is shelter gas and 
electricity said supervisor robert l jackson jr 
supervisor elizabeth coggsjones voted against the proposal 
i havent supported cashless welfare vouchers because i 
believe its punitive she said everyone on afdc is not 
mismanaging afdc money 
the board heard evidence that mismanagement of welfare funds has 
clogged milwaukee courts county circuit court judge lee wells said 
in a letter to the board that 85 percent of the eviction cases he 
hears involve tenants receiving welfare 
the proposals sponsor supervisor richard d nyklewicz jr 
said he wasnt surprised the amendment passed by such a wide 
margin 
the board has traditionally been on record trying to improve 
the accountability to the program he said 
the federal government already permits the use of welfare 
benefit vouchers to directly pay vendors like landlords and utility 
companies in cases of demonstrated mismanagement by a recipient 
but nyklewicz said his proposal would require vouchers in all 
welfare cases to ensure welfare benefits are spent only on housing 
and essentials 
the advantage of a voucher system to pay landlords directly 
for rent is that there should be a dramatic reduction in the number 
of eviction cases to be heard every day wells wrote it would 
also ensure a stable home environment for the children of parents 
who are receiving afdc payments 
milwaukee county currently distributes 64 million per month in 
food stamps and 166 million in afdc benefits according the 
department of social services 
gov tommy g thompson who has initiated two welfare 
experiments has said he would support the milwaukee county plan 
thompson urged approval in 1987 of wisconsins learnfare 
program which allows the state to cut a welfare familys monthly 
benefits if a school reports a teenage student has been 
consistently absent without excuse 
the thompson administration also has experimented with a program 
called workfare which requires welfare recipients to participate 
in job training or work parttime to keep their benefits

a judge dismissed a 1 billion lawsuit 
by neighbors of the defunct rancho seco nuclear plant declaring 
their radiation exposure was no more dangerous than drinking four 
diet sodas in a lifetime 
the class action suit filed in october 1985 alleged that the 
residents were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation through the 
deliberate discharge of contaminated water into a stream 
but on thursday four days before the case was to go to trial 
sacramento county superior court judge anthony decristoforo jr 
threw it out 
he said the 208 plaintiffs were exposed to less than one 
millirem of radiation a year that is the same amount absorbed in 
the body by drinking four diet sodas in a lifetime or smoking less 
than one cigarette in a lifetime he said 
this is unbelievable theyve dragged us through the 
dirt said plaintiff lynn davis 
morton friedman the residents lawyer said he would appeal the 
decision 
sacramento municipal utility district officials had maintained 
that the level of exposure to residents living within 10 miles of 
rancho seco was well below the 25 millirem limit set by the federal 
government 
the nuclear plant 30 miles southeast of sacramento which opened 
in 1975 was closed by a june 1989 ballot measure after a series of 
management and operating difficulties

the texas system of electing district judges 
at large was upheld today by the 5th us circuit court of appeals 
which ruled that judicial elections do not fall under the voting 
rights act 
the ruling rejected arguments by minorities who said that such 
atlarge voting denies them an equal chance to elect candidates 
they want by in effect diluting their votes among a large 
population of voters 
the ruling applied specifically to nine urban counties in texas 
but was eagerly awaited because of possible broader application in 
louisiana a similar challenge to judicial districting is pending 
with a court hearing scheduled this afternoon a challenge is also 
pending in georgia which is in a different circuit of the appeals 
court 
a threejudge panel of the appeals court had upheld the atlarge 
voting system in a 21 ruling in may but brought the case back 
before the entire 15member court for reconsideration 
the majority opinion written by thomas gibbs gee of houston 
said the judge are not representatives of the people 
these offices are not representative ones and their 
occupants are not representatives he said indeed the state 
processes for filling them need not even be elective as those for 
all representative offices presumably must be 
sam d johnson of austin in a scathing dissent called the 
decision a burning scar on the flesh of the voting rights act 
the majority opinion is not simply wrong it is dangerous 
no previous court has ever even suggested that judicial 
elections might be exempt from the reach of section 2 of the the 
voting rights act he wrote 
in the majority opinion gee wrote that in 1982 congress passed 
a law to test for dilution of voting strength but stopped short of 
imposing such a test for judicial offices 
should congress seek to install such a test for judicial 
elections it must say so plainly the court said 
instead it has thus far plainly said the contrary 
the case was brought to court by the league of united latin 
american citizens and other miniority groups who said atlarge 
voting for state judges prevents them from electing minority 
candidates 
us district judge lucius bunton of midland agreed ruling that 
the system violated the voting rights act he ordered the state to 
divide the nine counties into electoral subdistricts 
those counties dallas harris bexar tarrant travis 
lubbock midland ector and jefferson elect 172 of texas 390 
district judges who rule on matters of state law and preside over 
trials 
the threejudge panel of the appeals court reversed buntons 
decision saying that congress did not mean for judicial elections 
to fall under the voting rights act 
in the louisiana district judge case us district judge john 
parker ordered that 11 districts be redesigned to enhance the 
chance of electing black judges 
only six of louisianas 254 district and appellate court judges 
are black 
also at issue in louisiana is a state supreme court district in 
new orleans the only district in the state represented by two 
justices elected at large

the state department said friday the sudanese 
government is threatening an international relief effort by bombing 
towns in rebelheld areas where assistance programs are in 
operation 
us ambassador james cheek has raised the issue with sudanese 
president omar elbashir but has received no assurance that the 
bombing will stop said deputy spokesman richard boucher 
these bombings are a threat to the relief effort in sudan 
he said 
relief workers cannot operate if their lives are in jeopardy 
from military action boucher said it is bitterly ironic that 
these bombings come at a time when sudan is undergoing a drought 
which will make a massive relief effort necessary next year 
the combination of drought and civil war eventually is expected 
to put millions of lives at risk in sudan according to independent 
estimates 
a sept 20 attack on the town of bor boucher said occurred 
while un and international red cross relief planes were on the 
ground in that town no relief workers have been injured but the 
bombings have caused civilian casualties 
boucher deplored the bombings and called on the sudanese 
government to reach agreement on a ceasefire the war involves 
forces loyal to the moslemdominated national government against 
nonmoslem rebels based in the south

five weeks after iraqs deadline for 
embassies in occupied kuwait to shut down diplomats were still 
holding out in 15 missions friday despite meager supplies and 
cordons of iraqi troops outside 
spain and south korea were the latest nations to close their 
missions because of unbearable living conditions 
a spanish foreign ministry spokesman in madrid said charge 
daffaires juan jose buitrago left kuwait on thursday and was in 
baghdad 
the south korean foreign ministry announced in seoul that it had 
temporarily closed its embassy due to the deteriorated 
situation there it said ambassador soh byungyong and the few 
remaining staff arrived in jordan on thursday 
most embassies have been under siege since aug 24 the iraqi 
deadline for foreign missions to close and move to baghdad most 
that remain open are those of western countries and their water 
and electricity have been cut 
iraq issued the deadline as a way to tighten control over kuwait 
following the iraqi invasion on aug 2 iraq later said it had 
annexed the occupied land and that embassies that refused to close 
would lose their diplomatic immunity 
iraq made good on the threat two weeks ago when its troops 
forced their way into the diplomatic compounds of canada belgium 
france and the netherlands briefly detaining five western consuls 
western capitals retaliated by expelling iraqi military attaches 
and envoys and iraq responded in kind 
still none of the four embassies that reported harassment by 
the iraqi troops in kuwait has closed 
italian foreign ministry spokesman alessandro franco said in 
rome that the iraqis had imposed a total blockade on the italian 
embassy as of wednesday 
he said that until then a clerk had been allowed to take in 
water bread fresh fruit and other supplies every day for the 
ambassador marco colombo and the second secretary 
franco said there were no plans for the two diplomats to leave 
however 
the british foreign office said this week that two of the four 
diplomats still in the british embassy will be withdrawn to 
conserve dwindling food supplies 
a spokesman in london said british ambassador michael weston and 
consul larry banks will remain 
iraqi troops had forced the diplomats to remain indoors for more 
than a month and the swimming pool was being used for washing he 
said on condition of anonymity 
we are determined to keep the embassy open for as long as 
possible in the hope this will offer some tangible assurance to 
the british community that remains he said the government 
wants to make clear that it does not recognize the annexation of 
kuwait by iraq 
some of the britons like other westerners who have been banned 
from traveling are being held as human shields at potential 
military targets many other westerners still are hiding in kuwait 
us ambassador nathaniel howell and a handful of aides remain 
in the us mission they have boiled swimming pool water to drink 
and burned furniture for cooking fuel 
the belgian foreign ministry said friday the situation is not 
physically worse but increasingly more difficult psychologically 
for its ambassador his deputy and five other nondiplomatic 
belgians in the embassy 
the embassies that are still occupied are bahrain belgium 
britain canada france italy luxembourg the netherlands oman 
qatar saudi arabia senegal united arab emirates the united

a monthold hiring freeze by the state has 
resulted in cadavers stacking up at the state anatomy board 
ronald s wade the board administrator of the board is running 
the show singlehandedly after his embalmer had a heart attack and 
his secretary quit 
wade who once had three embalmers working for him told his 
board at an emergency meeting thursday that processing nearly 800 
bodies a year for use by doctors and teaching hospitals cannot be 
done by one person 
i personally could not continue in that situation he said 
and as bodies continue to arrive at a rate of 65 a month we 
quickly may have a public health problem 
if storage space fills to capacity as a cadaver comes in the 
door it will simply be sent to the crematorium said board 
chairman michael n sheridan 
but help may be on the way 
sheridan said the state department of health and mental hygiene 
has agreed to seek an exemption from the hiring freeze so a 
secretary and an embalmer can be hired 
the boards predicament is a very real problem said deputy 
health secretary nelson j sabatini i told them we would move 
the request for exemption through very quickly and support it im 
confident they will get relief 
the hiring freeze was imposed by gov william donald schaefer to 
cope with a budget deficit that could reach 270 million 
the anatomy boards members represent the medical schools 
private doctors and hospitals that rely on the agency to provide 
cadavers organs and tissues for training and education 
the board received 743 bodies last year up from perhaps 150 
when wade first took over the agency 17 years ago 
about 250 of the bodies are embalmed for use in anatomy classes 
by medical and dental students many of the others are the sources 
of bones eyes and other tissues used in transplants and other 
medical procedures

the only way to review the live rock n roll 
show of the teenage mutant ninja turtles seemed to be with a pair 
of turtle authorities in tow matt raeburn 9 and alex raeburn 6 
their father had to admit that the opening night performance of 
the coming out of their shells tour was far better than he had 
expected 
it was imaginative well produced technically sophisticated and 
surprisingly entertaining it could serve as a model for what a 
kids first rock concert ought to be 
the turtle authorities can speak for themselves it was the 
best concert of all time said matt alex so dazzled that he 
couldnt speak until the next morning pronounced his first concert 
the best thing ive seen yet 
the show begins before the curtain goes up april oneill the 
tv reporter who has befriended the turtles appears in the audience 
broadcasting a live onthescene report of concert preparations 
the report appears on large video screens on either side of the 
stage 
throughout the show a camera follows her around the theater and 
her reports punctuate the music as a story line unfolds 
the turtles michelangelo raphael leonardo and donatello 
make their grand entrance from beneath four manhole covers in a 
burst of fireworks and open the show with pizza power a paean 
to their favorite food it has good guitar a great melody and 
makes me hungry said matt 
the next character to appear is splinter the turtles ninja 
master a humansized mutant rat who dispenses his philosophy in 
epigrammatic phrases reminiscent of yoda in star wars he sings 
skipping stones 
its not about stones its about the ways of life said 
matt it is the turtles most relaxing song quiet and peaceful 
and good to move to he said 
roving cameramen follow the turtles onstage transmitting 
mtvlike concert footage directly to the video screens beside the 
stage in radio city music hall where the turtles will perform 
until oct 7 before beginning a 40city national tour 
no appearance of the turtles would be complete without an 
interruption by the evil shredder and his foot clan a troop of 
ninja robots 
shredder captures april oneill disrupts the turtles show and 
otherwise attempts to finally rid the world of the turtles does he 
succeed 
youll have to see it to find out what happens said matt 
based on the comments of the turtle authorities quoted here the 
show captures whatever it is that fascinates kids about the teenage 
mutant ninja turtles

the governments main economic forecasting 
gauge plunged 12 percent in august its steepest fall in three 
years and an indication one economist said of nothing but dark 
clouds ahead 
seven of the 11 components of the commerce departments index of 
leading indicators were off including stock prices and an index 
measuring consumer confidence 
orders for new plants and equipment dropped unfilled orders to 
us manufacturers fell as did building permits and the money 
supply weekly unemployment claims were up 
the report was the first government look into the economic 
future since iraqi occupied kuwait aug 2 
the only positive contributors were slower business delivery 
times an increase in orders for consumer goods an increase in the 
price of raw materials and a longer workweek 
but economist kermit baker of cahners economics in newton 
mass said even the longer workweek might be misleading 
perhaps its an indication that industry is trying to get by 
with its current workforce rather than hire new people he said 
other economists were similarly gloomy 
the decline in the leading indicators provides further proof 
that the recession began in august said jerry jasinowski 
president of the national association of manufacturers 
if were not in a recession were skating close to it said 
john silvia a financial economist with kemper financial services 
inc in chicago 
baker was even more blunt 
theres nothing but dark clouds he said noting that 
preliminary economic indicators released this month indicate that 
the august number was not a onemonth phenomenon the picture 
im getting is that this is a longterm trend 
the drop in the index designed to forecast activity six to nine 
months ahead was the sharpest since a 14 percent decline in the 
month after the oct 19 1987 stock market crash when the dow 
jones average of 30 industrial stocks plummeted 508 points in one 
day 
many economists believe wall street has now turned bearish again 
and is in for a prolonged period of falling prices 
since the stock market is a forwardlooking indicator the 
precipitous decline in stock prices is more tied to expectations of 
recession than to the deterioration in corporate earnings witnessed 
so far jasinowski said 
silvia said surveys after the 87 crash showed consumer 
confidence fell sharply but soon bounced back consumer confidence 
surveys following the iraqi invasion also plummeted he noted 
without signs of improvement 
lawrence a hunter deputy chief economist with the us chamber 
of commerce said that only consumer spending increases will keep 
the real gnp gross national product from falling in the current 
quarter but beginning in the fourth quarter the real gnp will 
fall 
the general definition of a recession is two consecutive 
declines in the gnp the nations total output of goods and 
services 
if a recession could be avoided through november the economic 
expansion will have reached its eighth anniversary it already is 
the nations longest in peacetime 
the various august changes in the index left it at 1442 percent 
of its 1982 base of 100 and down 04 percent over a year ago

president bush promised the exiled leader of 
kuwait today that his country will not remain under iraqi control 
kuwaits sovereignty and territorial integrity will be 
restored bush vowed in a departure statement as sheik jabir 
alahmed alsabah the emir of kuwait left the white house after a 
meeting with bush 
bush said that in their talks he had told the emir that 
americas resolve to end this aggression remains firm and 
undiminished 
he also praised the kuwaiti underground resistance movement that 
is fighting the iraqi invaders dispatched by president saddam 
hussein 
your principled courageous and decisive position in the face 
of the iraqi aggression of kuwait is a true expression of the 
unabated faith and commitment of the american people to the 
humanitarian morals on which and for which the united states of 
america was founded the emir told bush 
earlier bush complimented the emir on his speech thursday 
before the united nations general assembly calling it a 
marvelous thing 
the president said he could not recall anyone getting a standing 
ovation as the emir did when bush was united nation ambassador 
from 1971 to 1973 
i thought it showed that the world was strongly supporting 
what we all are trying to do bush told the emir in a photo 
session at the start of their meeting 
the united nations has passed eight resolutions opposing the 
iraqi invasion of kuwait 
following their oval office meeting bush and the emir were 
having lunch together their top aides were meeting in a cabinet 
room 
the white house meeting was intended as a clear sign that the 
united states still regards the 64yearold emir as the legitimate 
ruler of kuwait 
the president has consistently insisted that not only must iraq 
withdraw his invasion troops from kuwait but that the emir must be 
restored to the power he has wielded since 1977 
those objectives are unchanged bush told a fundraising 
dinner in detroit for rep bill schuette a republican senatorial 
candidate 
the emirs oval office visit is a chance for the president to 
talk with him about how its going his latest reports from inside 
kuwait said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
during bushs twoday political swing through four states he 
helped raise about 4 million for republican gubernatorial and 
senate candidates and drummed up public support for his persian 
gulf policies 
the emir traveled to washington following a speech thursday to 
the united nations where he thanked the international community 
for its stance against iraqs president saddam hussein 
alsabah was warmly greeted by the multinational body officials 
pointedly referred to him as leader of the state of kuwait in 
defiance of iraqs annexation of the oilrich nation 
the emir told the un general assembly that his country was 
suffering a crisis that is a manifold tragedy whose dire 
consequences affect not only kuwaitis but other peoples as well 
in fact it has jeopardized stability in the world especially 
in the gulf region he said adding his country now was ruled by 
rape destruction terror 
alsabah got a standing ovation from the general assembly but 
the threemember iraqi delegation walked out as he began speaking 
the emir voiced hope that the withdrawal of the invaders is 
god willing undoubtedly imminent 
saddam who sparked an international crisis by sending his 
troops into kuwait on aug 2 claims kuwait is an iraqi province 
the two nations have been engaged in a border dispute for a long 
time the united nations has decried the invasion in a series of 
resolutions that include setting up an international blockade to 
squeeze saddam economically by preventing trade 
the emir fled dasman palace in kuwait during the invasion 
escaping by car just moments before iraqi troops arrived his young 
brother was killed defending the palace 
the emir leader of a huge clan that filled government posts 
with about 1000 princes now maintains headquarters in exile in 
saudi arabia 
as kuwaits leader alsabah walked a precarious line between 
progressive forces at home who wanted democracy and forces next 
door in saudi arabia who feared democracy might spread and endanger 
their conservative theocratic rule 
his regime was considered less rigid than saudi arabias he 
allowed a lively if censored media and women in kuwait were 
allowed to drive and vote his family engendered loyalty by sharing 
kuwaits vast wealth with their countrymen 
prodemocracy demonstrations before the iraqi invasion called 
for more powersharing rather than the emirs ouster 
some members of congress have criticized the us stance toward 
the autocratic government but secretary of state james a baker 
iii said now is not the time to press for structural changes

one of south americas most important 
drug trafficking networks has been destroyed in raids by us drug 
enforcement administration agents and bolivian police officials 
said friday 
at least 300 antidrug police and 20 dea agents destroyed 
cocaineprocessing labs and confiscated airplanes radio 
transmission facilities ranches and mansions said don ferrarone 
dea chief in bolivia 
a us agent was wounded in gunfire during the raids which 
began monday two traffickers were killed and several wounded 
police said at least 70 people were arrested including carmelo 
meco dominguez the reputed head of the smashed drug network 
dominguez 34 considered one of bolivias top three drug 
traffickers handled five to 10 tons of pure cocaine a month much 
of it bound for the us market law enforcement agents said 
we have destroyed one of the top trafficking operations in 
bolivia and south america ferrarone said he said the network 
shipped cocaine to colombia and to mexico and had strong ties to 
colombias medellin and cali cartels 
among those arrested were pilots chemists and police and air 
force officers who worked for dominguezs network police said 
ferrarone said one of those arrested automobile dealer cordoba 
simons faces cocainetrafficking charges in miami 
the capture of all these people is the first step us 
ambassador robert gelbard said the hard part is for the bolivian 
government to follow up with the prosecution and conviction of 
traffickers our experience has been that traffickers escape or are 
let out of jail 
the raids were concentrated in bolivias principal cocaleaf and 
cocaineproducing regions and resulted in confiscation of property 
worth at least 10 million officials said the seized assets 
include simons automobile dealership eight airplanes and a 
nightclub with a revolving floor and a 300000 sound system 
raul loayza the undersecretary of the interior said dominguez

officials said 
he was identified as hawthorne hope 35 of detroit 
two traffickers were killed and several wounded in the 
confrontation police said 
bolivia an impoverished country of 7 million people grows

trustees of the college board voted friday to 
postpone for a month a decision on whether to adopt sweeping 
changes in the scholastic aptitude test including possible 
addition of a written section 
board officials refused to comment on the precise nature of the 
changes 
but documents suggest that a key change might be the addition 
for the first time of a written essay section a change some fear 
could work against minority and immigrant groups the documents 
were made available to the associated press by fairtest a 
cambridge massbased group critical of the sat 
the sat taken by about a million college bound students 
annually consists of two multiple choice sections testing verbal 
and mathematical skills the college board sponsors the exam 
other possible changes under discussion include more 
problemsolving questions in the math section and increased 
emphasis on critical reading in the verbal section 
how such questions might be grouped or organized is still being 
debated according to knowledgeable sources who insisted on 
anonymity 
such changes if approved probably would not take effect before 
1993 according to previous statements from the educational testing 
service the princeton njbased organization that administers 
the sat 
a brief statement issued by the board following its meeting said 
trustees view proposals to revamp the sat as positive and 
exciting 
however because of the importance and complexity of the 
issues under consideration they have requested additional 
financial and programmatic information before making a final 
decision 
the boards statement said it anticipated the issues would be 
resolved within the next three or four weeks that made it likely 
that the announcement would coincide with the boards annual 
national forum scheduled oct 31nov 2 in boston 
spokeswoman janice gams said college board president donald m 
stewart and other board officials would not elaborate beyond the 
statement until a final decision was announced 
warren day a spokesman for ets in princeton also declined to 
comment on the deliberations and referred all questions to the 
college board 
however the documents obtained from fairtest suggest that one 
factor contributing to the delay were strong objections from 
several educators and state legislators who fear that the addition 
of a writing section would be unfair to minority students and 
recent immigrants 
in a letter dated aug 1 addressed to university of 
californiaberkeley president david gardner patrick s hayashi 
associate vice chancellor of admissions and enrollment objected to 
the proposed new written sat section he wrote that the college 
board has done an abysmally poor job in examining the possible 
effects on nonnative speakers 
a letter to stewart from california state assembly speaker 
willie l brown jr also questioned the fairness of giving language 
skills added weight 
doesnt this place recent immigrants and other language 
minority students at a competitive disadvantage if the test results 
were used as an integral component of admissions reviews he 
wrote 
questions have been repeatedly raised in recent years by 
fairtest and others about alleged racial and cultural bias in sat 
questions the college board has consistently denied such charges

the bush administration gave assurances friday 
that american troops would defend israel in the event of an iraqi 
attack 
if iraq attacks israel the us will respond immediately and 
forcefully against iraq a senior state department official told 
reporters after secretary of state james a baker iii held talks 
with arab foreign ministers its that simple 
asked if the us troops in the persian gulf area would be used 
to defend israel the official replied 
the american forces are there obviously they are there to 
defend against iraqi aggression and if that iraqi aggression 
extended against israel the american forces would react to that 
the united states and israel dont have a mutual defense treaty 
while additional us weapons were sent to israel in mideast wars 
all israeli governments have insisted they dont want american 
soldiers fighting israels battles 
last sunday however iraqi president saddam hussein threatened 
to attack saudi arabia other arab countries and israel if the 
usled economic boycott of baghdad strangles his country 
the blockade of trade with iraq is designed to force saddam to 
reverse his aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
we have a commitment to israeli security that is rockhard and 
unshakable a second state department official said there is 
nothing new in that its been there for a long time 
if there is a threat to israel that commitment to israels 
security comes into effect he said 
the two officials spoke to reporters under rules that shielded 
their identity 
their statements were so direct that it seemed clear they 
reflected the views of baker who met with a group of foreign 
ministers from the persian gulf 
baker also met separately with syrian foreign minister farouk 
shara and the foreign ministers of tunisia and algeria 
shara told baker that syrian president hafez assad found on a 
recent trip to tehran that iran was steadfast in demanding an iraqi 
withdrawal from kuwait 
assad discussed the plight of the six american hostages held by 
proiranian factions in lebanon with the iranians but received no 
solid information to suggest their freedom was imminent the us 
officials said

the government announced friday it 
would lower utility bills for the poor suspend layoffs for civil 
servants and give food to hungry peasants in an apparent effort to 
head off a nationwide protest 
the announcement came after a meeting thursday with the leftist 
sandinista front sandinista leader and former president daniel 
ortega said there was good will to alleviate the hunger and 
unemployment that have accompanied government efforts to make 
market reforms in the economy 
but sandinista labor leaders say a nationwide protest is still 
set for monday 
what we are seeing here is a divorce between two sectors of 
the sandinista front that should be following the same line 
said antonio lacayo senior aide to president violeta barrios de 
chamorro 
we hope that common sense prevails lacayo told a news 
conference at the foreign correspondents club 
there were some indications that ortegas sandinista front was 
trying to cool pressures for another strike 
i cant say we have solved the problems i dont want to 
create expectations but there is good will to do so ortega said 
in a radio broadcast thursday night 
lacayo considered the real power behind mrs chamorros 
government called thursdays meeting very constructive 
the measures include lower utility bills for poor people free 
milk for schoolchildren free food for peasants affected by bad 
crops temporary work and additional welfare for civil servants who 
have been laid off and the creation of a commission to oversee land 
distribution 
he said the government will suspend further spending cuts and 
the trimming of the bureaucracy until agreement is reached on how 
to fix the economy beset by inflation and deficit 
lacayo declined to say whether the measures were the result of 
strike threats two sandinistaled strikes in may and july 
virtually paralyzed the country and ended only after major 
government concessions 
we are in a very difficult situation lacayo said it is 
categorized by some officials of the world bank as maybe the most 
difficult in the world it is easily the most difficult in latin 
america 
lacayo said a 10point sandinista agenda contained social 
economic and political elements 
regarding the economic points especially those of social 
import we are making the effort to see to those sectors 
mentioned lacayo said 
but on the political points which asked for presidential 
decrees to be rescinded when the sandinista front rules again 
through elections it can issue whatever decress it wants he 
said 
we are not going to cogovern with the sandinista front he 
added 
also friday vice president virgilio godoy denied news reports 
that quoted him as saying he would force his way into the 
government complex to prove he is giving the orders now that mrs 
chamorro is out of the country 
this is a refried version by the sandinista communications 
system and its spokesmen to distort and misinform systematically 
godoy told the associated press 
mrs chamorro who is in new york and spoke at the united 
nations on thursday has denied office space to godoy and not left 
him in charge the three times she has left the country since taking 
power april 25 
godoy a former sandinista labor minister who became 
disillusioned with ortegas movement is considered more 
conservative than mrs chamorro 
police surrounded the presidential complex friday but lacayo 
said the cordon is a normal thing in these times of protest

a bill designating paxton soil as the 
official dirt of massachusetts has set the dust flying in this 
small town with selectmen convinced the state needs to dig deeper 
for noteworthy earth 
weve got clay up to our ears selectman thomas j 
cunningham said friday its been this way for years and 
everybody knew it and we were very surprised when we heard about 
this we werent even part of the process 
but lawmakers and soil officials said the townsfolk dont 
understand the intent of the designation 
its just a little routine thing that was done to bring 
attention to the success of the soil conservation people said 
state rep stephen brewer of barre who along with rep kevin 
osullivan of paxton filed the bill designating the official 
massachusetts soil paxton soil was picked because it is the 
dominant dirt in the state he said 
officials in paxton a small town of about 3900 in a hilly 
wooded area of central massachusetts were surprised when a plaque 
commemorating the soil showed up at town hall 
we try to be very quiet cunningham said 
selectmen voted thursday night to send a letter to local 
legislators saying they think the selection was a mistake 
theres areas that dont grow unless you fertilize the living 
daylights out of it said cunningham adding that he thought 
legislators should be more concerned about the states financial 
woes than naming an official soil 
theres so many things to do beside giving that award he 
said 
paxton fine sandy loam occurs all across massachusetts but was 
first described in paxton hence the name said william taylor a 
scientist with the us department of agricultures soil 
conservation service in holden 
the idea of picking a state soil came up about four years ago 
he said 
its to bring about the awareness of the soil as a natural 
resource he said paxton soil is the dominant dirt in the state 
and i dont think the soil is that bad he said

the international energy agency advised western 
nations friday to brace for a possible oil shortage but said there 
was no immediate need to tap strategic reserves to offset the loss 
of oil from iraq and kuwait 
echoing the conclusions drawn at a meeting last month the 
groups governing board said in a comunique that rising oil price 
rises were driven by extreme political uncertainty not short 
supplies 
supplies lost due to the embargo on kuwait and iraqs oil 
imposed after iraq overran the emirate on aug 2 have been offset 
by increased production by other nations it said and oil markets 
remain adequately supplied 
however the board recommended that the 21 member countries take 
all decisions necessary so they could act quickly in the event 
of a future shortfall 
the united states this week decided to tap its strategic 
petroleum reserves for this first time in response to the persian 
gulf crisis president bush on wednesday ordered the sale of 5 
million barrels of oil from the nations strategic reserve which 
contains 590 million barrels of oil 
the bush administration said its move was a test to see if the 
system could work in an emergency 
but the energy agency made no call for the germans and japanese 
to follow washingtons lead and use even a symbolic amount of their 
reserves 
some us officials have advocated similar action by west 
germany with 197 million barrels of reserves and japan with 215 
million barrels most official western oil stocks are held by the 
united states japan and west germany 
if a significant shortage of oil supplies develops the board 
will convene an emergency session on short notice it said in a 
communique 
the energency agency recommended that member countries intensify 
energy conservation and efficiency measures it also urged 
governments to allow the full increase in oil prices to pass 
through to the market and suggested flexibility in the area of 
environmental regulations 
oil companies were advised to continue drawing on commercial 
stocks and use discretion in purchases to minimize volatility in 
the world oil market 
john easton assistant us energy secretary for international 
affairs said he was satisfied with the results of the meeting 
i think got what we wanted he said weve cleared the 
underbrush and done everything necessary for an effective and 
efficient response 
the governing board will reconvene sometime during october 
regardless of whether an emergency session becomes necessary 
the agencys members include japan australia new zealand 
canada most western european countries and the united states

jordans crown prince hassan said friday he 
was deeply discouraged by the hostile international response to his 
governments persian gulf peace efforts and by the widespread 
indifference to the economic upheaval the crisis has caused in 
jordan 
with a mixture of sorrow bitterness and sarcasm hassan spoke 
for more than an hour to a gathering of middle east experts and 
reporters assembled by the center for strategic and international 
studies a research group 
hassan defended the efforts of his brother king hussein to try 
to reach a peace settlement at a time when the parties to the 
dispute are remorselessly moving toward a conflict 
given the hardening of positions in recent days he expressed 
wonderment that there wasnt a niggling of doubt that warfare 
was not the ideal answer 
hussein has been at the forefront of efforts to find a 
diplomatic solution having visited baghdad and a number of other 
capitals since the crisis erupted eight weeks ago the bush 
administration has ruled out talks with the iraqis unless kuwait is 
restored as an independent state 
the international perception of jordans position has been one 
of acceptance of iraqs invasion of kuwait but hassan said his 
government has implemented un economic sanctions against iraq 
with complete loyalty 
this policy has been carried out he said even though it has 
meant a 50 percent decline in the gross national product 
hassan chided wealthy countries for not fulfilling their promise 
thus far of economic assistance for jordan to compensate for the 
loss of trade with iraq 
is it expected that jordan commit economic hari kari he 
asked are we expected to commit economic suicide the bush 
administration position is that jordan deserves credit for reducing 
economic ties with iraq but has said it expects total compliance 
with the embargo 
the perception of husseins position on the crisis was partly 
shaped by his statement shortly after the invasion that iraqi 
president saddam hussein was a patriot 
in an open letter to hussein published here this week the saudi 
ambassador prince bandar accused the monarch of ignoring 
horrifying acts of rape and destruction by iraq which are 
unprecedented in arab history 
hassan expressed regret that there seemed to be a total 
blackout on dialogue adding that airwave diplomacy has 
leaders talking at each other instead of to each other 
the jordanian prince said he believes more efforts should be 
made to work out understandings concerning the future shape of 
a settlement once iraq complies with the un security council 
demand for a complete withdrawal of its forces from kuwait 
such understandings presumably would entail territorial and 
financial concessions to iraq in return for an agreement to a troop 
pullout from kuwait 
hassan also urged that the principles the security council has 
applied for a settlement of the gulf crisis should also be applied 
to the arabisraeli dispute meaning the return of israeliheld 
territory to palestinians 
to ignore that aspect of the overall problem would invite 
conflict in that area once the gulf problem is resolved he said 
in response to criticism from the state department and others 
about jordans decision to host a meeting of arab radicals two 
weeks ago hassan said secretary of state james a baker iii was 
conferring with syrian officials in damascus at the very time the 
meeting in amman was being held 
syria is on the state departments list of countries that 
allegedly sponsor international terrorism

the first sale of federally subsidized public 
housing units to its residents was completed on friday for 1 
the transfer of the kenilworthparkside public housing 
development in the citys northeast quadrant capped a fiveyear 
process in which the residents successfully managed the complex and 
qualified to purchase the property under a program boosted by 
housing secretary jack kemp 
the residents have worked so hard over the past five years to 
make this possible this can open the door for residents of other 
public housing complexes across the country whod like to have a 
definite say about their living conditions said kimi gray head 
of the kenilworthparkside resident management corp 
the transfer of 132 housing units to the management corporation 
was the first phase of the changeover with the remaining 332 units 
to be exchanged as renovations were completed 
a study by an independent accounting firm showed the program 
would save the government 6 million over 10 years and 26 million 
over 40 years 
the sale was made possible in part by amendments to the 1987 
housing act which gave resident councils the right to manage their 
own developments 
the bill sponsored by thenrep kemp and del walter fauntroy 
ddc also created procedures allowing residents to buy their 
developments after three years of sufficient selfmanagement 
kemp said the kenilworthparkside sale helped advance the bush 
administrations goal of achieving a million new firsttime and 
lowincome home owners by 1992 
it creates additional hope and opportunity because it creates 
more jobs reduces crime and can help reinvigorate our urban 
communities the secretary said in a statement

after 83 years the final stone will be placed 
atop washington cathedrals st paul tower on saturday fulfilling 
pierre lenfants vision of a great church for national 
purposes 
president bush will be on hand just as president theodore 
roosevelt was when a foundation stone quarried in bethlehem was 
laid at noon sept 29 1907 
the church is the seat of the bishop of the episcopal diocese of 
washington but also calls itself a place of prayer for all 
people and has often held interdenominational services bush is 
an episcopalian

church in his plan that plan was never fully realized 
the 873021square foot building roughly 14th century english 
gothic in style is the sixth largest cathedral in the world 
st peters in rome is the largest followed by one in seville 
the unfinished st john the divine in new york and cathedrals in

cathedral president woodrow wilson is buried there seven bishops

crucial point in 1983 that by building on a payasyou go basis 
the cathedral could both complete its west towers and expand its 
program of outreach to the poor

disbanded and two air bases closed in troop cutbacks prompted by 
lessening tensions and escalating economic woes in south africa 
officials said friday 
president fw de klerk has said defense forces can be reduced 
because of declining regional tensions partly linked to the 
governments plan to end apartheid 
meanwhile rising prices and a spreading recession has pressured 
officials to cut military spending yet still leaving south africa 
with the regions most powerful armed forces earlier this year 
the navy was cut by 25 percent 
gen jannie geldenhuys head of the armed services said 11 air 
force units and five army units would be disbanded or consolidated

the defense ministry did not say how many troops would be 
involved in the cuts or how many would leave the military

exercises and withdrawal of some weapons and other equipment the 
officials said 
geldenhuys said the air forcess buccaneer jet bombers and 
cessna light trainer aircraft would be withdrawn from service 
radar coverage will also be reduced he said

the exiled ruler of kuwait gave president bush 
a graphic account friday of the iraqi occupation of his country 
that according to a bush aide could lead the president to push 
for tougher un action against saddam hussein 
asked if the kuwaiti report would prompt bush to seek 
unbacked military action against iraq the presidents national 
security adviser brent scowcroft replied thats one of those 
things thats conceivable 
one administration official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said it was more likely that a request would come before the united 
nations within a week or so probably from kuwait seeking a 
condemnation of iraqs treatment of kuwait 
the official said the united states would support such a 
resolution but does not anticipate it would include military 
action 
were not at that point yet the official said 
instead such a resolution would highlight allegations of 
atrocities in kuwait and recommend action that makes iraq 
accountable possibly by demanding future financial reparations 
to the kuwaitis the source said 
sheik jabir alahmed alsabah the emir of kuwait told bush 
that the iraqis were destroying and looting his country with 
terrifying conditions that include taking patients off life 
supports and removing babies from incubators so the equipment could 
be shipped back to iraq scowcroft said 
for his part bush said after the meeting that iraqi 
aggression has ransacked and pillaged a oncepeaceful and secure 
country its population assaulted incarcerated intimidated and 
even murdered 
bush said saddam was trying to wipe kuwait off the face of 
the map 
scowcroft meeting with reporters said he thought this whole 
element of what the iraqis are doing inside kuwait to a whole 
people could conceivably be the subject of another un action 
but he said the administration was not actively pursuing that 
asked if the emir had asked for a military strike to drive out 
saddams forces scowcroft said 
no he did not not in so many words you can subliminally 
read between the lines if you wish the two had a lengthy 
discussion of attitudes public opinion in the arab world 
scowcroft would not discuss the prospects for us military 
action but did say bush and the emir had discussed options beyond 
the un economic sanctions 
the adviser described the emir as contending that his country 
is being destroyed right now and that the longer the situation goes 
on the way it is the less there will be of what is recognizable as 
kuwait 
asked how long the united states is willing to wait before 
taking other action scowcroft said 
its in everyones interest to see whether or not there is a 
peaceful resolution of this by giving the trade embargo a chance 
to have an effect he said 
but he added there is no question that whats happening 
inside kuwait affects the timetable 
the united nations already has passed eight resolutions 
condemning saddams aug 2 invasion of kuwait and has imposing a 
sea and air trade embargo against iraq 
scowcroft briefing reporters on the meeting said the 
atrocities and destruction inside kuwait really are worthy of 
world attention and a un resolution is one way to bring that 
kind of attention on it this is not just a peaceful occupation 
this is a destruction of a people 
he said the emir had described forcible movement of kuwaitis 
from the southern part of the kingdom with their identification 
papers being given to iraqis and palestinians being moved in from 
the north in sort of a repopulation 
the emir also described widespread looting including the 
seizure of medical equipment for shipment to iraq 
bush said as the emir left that americas resolve to end this 
aggression against kuwait remains firm and undiminished 
the emir fled his homeland by car during saddams aug 2 
military invasion and now maintains his headquarters in saudi 
arabia

a dispute friday about how to combat urban 
smog exposed the deep divisions that remain between house and 
senate negotiators as they try to craft a compromise clean air bill 
in the final weeks of the legislative session 
we have consumed nearly two weeks without making any 
progress said sen max baucus dmont chairman of the 
housesenate conference we are still miles apart on some 
issues 
during a meeting that some called critical to getting a 
clean air bill completed before congress adjourns next month the 
senate flatly rejected a house proposal for pollution controls on 
automobiles and accused the house of stalling because it had taken 
11 days to prepare 
the negotiations which began july 13 has focused in recent 
weeks on what pollution controls to impose on automobiles and 
requirements for a limited phasein of alternative fuel vehicles 
the issue has been of major importance to rep john dingell 
dmich chairman of the house delegation dingells state is home 
to the major us automakers 
senators had complained for days that the house wasnt 
responding to a proposal submitted in midseptember then when the 
house proposal was received the senate quickly rejected it as 
being so unacceptable that it cannot even serve as a basis of 
discussion 
dingell accused the senator of engaging in speechmaking instead 
of focusing on the issue 
i feel whats going on is a delay strategy said sen john 
chafee rri suggesting that staunch opponents of the clean air 
bill may succeed in blocking it in the final days of congress 
both the house and senate earlier this year overwhelmingly 
approved clean air bills that impose tough new pollution controls 
on utilities factories and automobiles but efforts to work out 
differences in the two bills have made only slow progress 
earlier this week president bush raised the possibility that 
the bill may die if the pace of negotiations isnt quickened 
fridays squabble centered on concerns from senate negotiators 
about provisions that would require tougher emission controls on 
automobiles and the phasein of alternative fuel vehicles to reduce 
urban smog 
baucus chafee and other senators called the house proposal a 
step backward from the legislation already approved by the house 
and senate rep henry waxman dcalif in turn accused the 
senators of misunderstanding the offer 
i dont think youve looked at this proposal he told 
senators 
at the heart of the sometimes raucous debate was concern also 
expressed by state pollution control officials that the house 
proposal would prevent other states from adopting the strong auto 
pollution control measures being taken by california 
there was also concern that an ambitious program to require the 
use of alternativefuel vehicles by fleet operators and a separate 
pilot program for alternativefuel personal passenger cars were 
being weakened 
however waxman contended that states would be allowed to more 
easily adopt the california pollution control standards under the 
proposal and said the fleet vehicle program would cover more cities 
and be stronger 
but senators remained unconvinced 
i think theres an element of mistrust on each side said 
sen alan simpson rwyo 
noting the complexity of the massive and highly technical clean 
air legislation he said there arent 15 people in the whole 
city that know whats in here 
after about three hours of discussions baucus and dingell 
agreed to turn the matter over to staff and schedule another public 
conference tuesday 
aside from the motor vehicle section of the bill the conferees 
must still tackle sections dealing with acid rain controls toxic 
chemical emissions from industrial plants requirements on the use 
of cleaner gasoline blends in some urban areas and whether to 
provide assistance to workers who lose their jobs because of 
tougher pollution control requirements

prosecutors in the nations first obscenity 
trial of an art gallery and its director said friday the case 
hinges on seven robert mapplethorpe photographs but defense 
lawyers said that focus is misplaced 
the states case is in some respects very simple said 
prosecutor frank prouty the pictures are the states case 
the issue is not the first amendment the issue is obscenity the 
issue is also displaying pictures of children in the state of 
nudity 
prouty said the jurys only duty is to determine the 
truthfulness of what the indictments allege that two of the 
photos show children with their genitals exposed and five photos 
show homosexual sex acts 
but attorney marc mezibov who represents the contemporary arts 
center told jurors that theres more to the case 
this is not about photographs it is about people he said 
the gallery and its director dennis barrie are charged with 
pandering obscenity and using children in nudity related material 
based on photographs in the 175photo exhibit robert 
mapplethorpe the perfect moment 
it drew more than 80000 people during its sevenweek 
appearance the mapplethorpe exhibit closed may 26 and now is on 
display in boston a grand jury viewed the exhibit april 7 before 
returning the indictments 
if convicted of both charges barrie could be sentenced to one 
year in jail and fined 2000 the gallery which marked its 50th 
anniversary last year could be fined 10000 for conviction on 
both counts 
we dont want any breaks we dont want any sympathy we want 
a fair shake mezibov told the jury 
opening statements were heard friday in hamilton county 
municipal court after the eightperson jury returned from a brief 
tour of the gallery 
attorney h louis sirkin who represents barrie previously told 
jurors that mapplethorpe was a homosexual and that some of the 
photographs depicted sexually explicit acts 
it was a retrospective a biography of an individual by 
showing his works sirkin said this particular photographer 
not only did beautiful pictures he also did some other pictures 
that are not so beautiful but they were pictures of the real world 
to him a world that he was surrounded by and he was a part of 
mapplethorpe died of acquired immune deficiency syndrome in 
march 1989 at age 42 
sirkin said the gallery believed the educational and cultural 
value outweighed other considerations in fulfilling its mission to 
display contemporary art 
there was controversy but there was only one intent and 
purpose to add to the cultural enhancement of the citizens of 
this city and this area he said 
it was brought here not to appeal to anyones prurient 
interest it was brought here to teach and to show to show the 
world this brilliant photographer and some of the inner makings of 
that man and some of the torture that perhaps he suffered 
the prosecution presented two witnesses police officers who 
testified that they saw the seven photographs on display at the 
gallery 
testimony will resume monday and is expected to continue all 
next week

nigerian troops paraded tanks in a show 
of force through monrovia on friday as the sounds of gunfire 
indicated a weeklong ceasefire was in danger of collapse in the 
liberian capital 
meanwhile a nigerian freighter carrying 150 tons of rice 
canned food and cooking oil was unloaded in port the first major 
food shipment since july to reach a capital where even the most 
basic of foodstuffs are in scarce supply 
about 1100 west african troops arrived in monrovia this week 
with a new field commander nigerias brig gen joshua dogonyaro 
gen dogonyaro toured the city in a long motorcade that included 
mohawk tanks and armored personnal carriers he also met at the 
us embassy with ambassador peter de vos and called on the 
british charge daffaires steven seaman 
rebel leader charles taylor had vowed to attack the fivenation 
west african task force if it sent reinforcements 
military experts and diplomats said cannon fire heard in the 
morning appeared to come from taylors rebels it wasnt known who 
if anyone the guns were leveled upon 
taylor who has declared himself provisional president of 
liberia announced a unilateral truce saturday that has been 
respected by the opposing rebel army of prince johson and by troops 
remaining loyal to slain president samuel doe 
taylor wants to organize elections oct 10 to choose a cabinet 
to lead the country but insists that he must head any government 
taylor began the 9monthold civil war when he invaded from ivory 
coast in december 
doe was tortured and slain by prince johnsons rebels this 
month 
taylors right to the presidency is challenged by prince johnson 
and by political science professor amos sawyer who was chosen 
interim president at a meeting of liberian exiles aug 30 held 
under the auspices of the economic community of west african 
states 
under the west african plan sawyer would return to organize 
elections in which he would not be allowed to be a candidate 
taylor has refused to let sawyer return saying he is a puppet of 
the west africans 
sawyer arrived in sierra leone on friday and said he would 
return to monrovia when it was safe to do so 
taylors force has been estimated at as many as 15000 troops 
but most are untrained teenagers the arrival of new west african 
forces boosting the total force to above 4000 troops clearly 
establishes the fivenation army as the most powerful in the 
country 
the west african armys stated purpose is to put an end to a war 
that has claimed more than 5000 civilian lives 
about 3000 west african refugees from monrovia arrived friday 
in freetown sierra leone aboard the nigerian warship ambe the 
refugees who said they had not eaten for three days told 
reporters the war in liberia was far from over 
they told stories of brutal killings a few days ago some 
rebels burst into our refugee camp seized three of our number and 
shot them saying we just feel like killing a few people one 
refugee said the rebels belonged to johnsons faction he said

bowing to pressure from her advisory council has dismissed a 
cabinet minister accused by the panel of corruption and 
incompetence 
the 19member council of state had demanded the ouster of public

for fair and nonviolent national elections

in a rare display of guilt from a 
disappearing government east german lawmakers trooped to the 
podium of parliament on friday and revealed their ties to the 
dreaded security arm of the former communist regime 
one cabinet minister resigned after admitting he had contacts 
with the notorious secret police or stasi while about a dozen 
lawmakers came up to the microphone to deny or explain the 
accusations against them 
the scene was a remarkable display of soulsearching by a 
troubled government in the final days of its brief existence 
the first freely elected parliament in east german history will 
meet one more time before it disbands on wednesday when the nation 
merges with west germany fridays anguished session lasted 12 
hours 
in one of its last acts parliament voted overwhelmingly to ask 
a committee investigating the secret police to release the names of 
56 officials three of them ministers and the rest parliament 
members who were purportedly on the secret police payroll 
lawmakers previously had authorized the committee to investigate 
individual members of parliament for ties to the despised police 
unit 
parliament also voted friday to ask the committee to divulge the 
names of the nine lawmakers in the 400member parliament who 
refused to authorize the committee to investigate their secret 
police records 
lawmakers gave those on the list a chance to address the 
accusations 
construction minister axel viehweger did he promptly resigned 
he said he had contacts with the secret police while he was on the 
energy council in the city of dresden during the former government 
which was toppled by a popular uprising last year 
prime minister lothar de maiziere told parliament that the 
investigatory committee informed him sept 13 that three of his 
ministers had worked for the stasi he said one has resigned an 
apparent reference to viehweger and two others had taken leaves 
of absence 
a total of 10 members of de maizieres 24member cabinet have 
stepped down since he took office earlier this year it wasnt 
known which he was referring to 
the lawmakers who described their contacts with the secret 
police said such ties were required under the old government all 
denied giving the stasi information that hurt anyone 
eberhard schiffner a christian democrat said he was the head 
of a state veterinary practice in 1963 he had to give information 
about his practice to the secret police he said 
he said he was not in a position to immediately detail the 
contacts 
i need time i need access to his secret police file and i 
need legal advice he said 
bernhardt opitz a lawmaker from the free democrat party 
dismissed the allegations against him as a pack of lies and 
inventions 
the committee plays as judge and jury he said angrily 
brigitte zschoche a member of the reformed communist party 
said she had contact with the secret police when she was paid a 
recruiting visit by the stasi in 1960 
former research and technology minister frank terpe who 
resigned last month when his social democrat party left the 
governing coalition denied he worked for the secret police 
since the fall of the communist government that ruled for four 
decades the nation has been obsessed with how to purge the tens of 
thousands of former stasi informants and agents from influential 
roles in politics and business 
the stasi many of whose members held other jobs they used as a 
cover helped keep the former hardline government in power through 
stifling surveillance intimidation and allegedly murder 
because they and other elite members of the old government had 
access to power connections and money they were able to maintain 
some control of the nation after a new inexperienced democratic 
government was elected in march 
there have been reports that many former functionaries and stasi 
agents are running businesses that were once stateowned but have 
now been freed to operate as private enterprises

seventyfour percent of chicagos innercity 
children have witnessed a slaying shooting stabbing or robbery 
according to a study and experts worry about the impact such 
violence has on youngsters mental health 
people think if theyre chronically exposed to this kind of 
violence kids adapt to it said dr carl bell a psychiatrist at 
the university of illinois school of medicine but theyre wrong 
if children who witness crimes appear withdrawn or silent its a 
symptom of the damage they just shut off 
the survey of more than 1000 elementary and high school 
children on chicagos south side found that of students who 
witnessed violent crimes in about half the cases the victim was a 
friend family member or neighbor in addition 46 percent of the 
students reported that they had been victims of violent crimes 
themselves 
and the victims arent receiving the attention and counseling 
they need said bell also head of the community mental health 
council which conducted the survey 
there are basically three areas where people impacted by 
witnessing violence show up in the criminal justice system in 
the mental health system or as a problem with the board of 
education bell said 
he said witnessing or being a victim of violence teaches that 
violence is a way to address problems as a result the youths 
often have difficulty dealing with their own aggression bell said 
you also see elements of nihilism he said if you see 
people getting killed you start to think that dying soon is 
inevitable some kids get chronically depressed withdrawn 
he said officials need to develop a consistent policy on dealing 
with the children 
they could develop from that a cadre of professionals able to 
deal with homicides and other community violence like shootings or 
stabbings bell said 
thats also true in detroit said anne milkodelpier 
program coordinator for detroits family bereavement center 
there are not a lot of professionals who are trained to deal with 
kids who witness violent crimes like homicides 
milkodelpier said detroits court system refers families of 
homicide victims under the age of 21 to the center a program run 
by a nonprofit private social services agency called the childrens 
center 
she also said she was surprised at the chicago surveys figures 
adding she believes the number of children witnessing violent 
crimes in detroit is definitely lower although no study has been 
done 
officials in philadelphia also could offer no comparable figures 
on children who witness violent crimes but the number is probably 
increasing said kemi adeleye a director at families of murder 
victims which deals with some of the young witnesses 
homicide crimes are getting quite common around here said 
adeleye whose agency is associated with the philadelphia district 
attorneys office but many say they just kind of get used to it 
its probably not so much that they get used to violent crimes but 
rather it becomes such a frequent thing that they are no longer as 
shocked by it

a man who was awarded city hall as 
compensation for a multimilliondollar court judgment needs the 
money not the building his brother said 
were not interested in actually owning part of east st 
louis said richard debow 59 of bargaintown nj debows 
brother walter was awarded the building and 220 acres of 
cityowned property thursday by a circuit court judge in nearby 
belleville 
if the city paid us 1025000 tomorrow we would probably 
give it back but at this point were looking for a forsale 
sign said the familys attorney clyde kuehn 
stunned city officials said they would appeal 
walter debow 55 suffered permanent brain damage after being 
beaten into a coma by a fellow prisoner at the city jail more than 
six years ago he has no shortterm memory and is being cared for 
at a headinjury rehabilitation center in new jersey 
debow who was in court thursday was in jail for a traffic 
charge of illegal transportation of alcohol at the time of the 
beating 
he won a 34 million judgment in 1985 with interest it has 
risen to 4 million financially strapped east st louis still owes 
at least 1 million kuehn said 
judge roger scrivners property award was the only way to 
guarantee debow would get his money said kuehn 
i think this decision is just a major miscarriage of justice 
and demonstrates bias against the city of east st louis said 
city attorney eric vickers 
the 4yearold city hall is worth 10 million vickers said and 
city officials had been negotiating with a company to sell the 
other property for 5 million to a company that wants to build a 
trash recycling plant 
in the meantime the city has tried to pay off debows award by 
selling 52 million in bonds but kuehn said they are only worth 
28 million 
debow will continue to hold the bonds however and collect 
payments on them his lawyer said 
east st louis is saddled with debts estimated at 47 million 
and gov james r thompson signed a 34 million bailout bill aug 
30 the money is to come from state bond issues 
the population of the city which has one of the highest 
homicide rates in the country fell from 55000 in 1980 to 40000 
this year according to census bureau estimates 
with all the financial problems weve had this is just icing 
on the cake said city clerk alzada christian carr

the chairman of the house armed services 
committee said friday he believes the bush administration is 
looking more favorably toward a war with iraq before the first of 
the year 
rep les aspin dwis said he based his assessment on four 
things the lessening chances of kuwait regaining its independence 
without war cooler weather in prospect in the persian gulf in 
coming months the moslems january pilgrimmage to mecca which 
would make fighting then more difficult and a more hawkish tone 
from the administration 
he also said he expects iraq to have biological weapons that 
could be used by years end 
aspin spoke at a meeting of a reporters breakfast group his 
comments were repeated later by his press secretary lynn reddy 
pressed by reporters to say war was likely in the eightweek 
standoff in the persian gulf aspin refused to make that 
prediction he did say however the administration is looking 
more favorably on an early war option according to his aide 
the comments by aspin came as president bushs national security 
adviser brent scowcroft said it was possible that the 
administration would seek unbacked military action against iraq 
based on a kuwaiti report of iraqi destruction of the occupied 
country 
thats one of those things thats conceivable scowcroft 
said 
at the breakfast aspin said the economic sanctions against 
iraq prompted by its invasion of kuwait on aug 2 have been 
succeesful in denying money to iraqi president saddam hussein 
however aspin said he does not believe the sanctions will allow 
the united states and other nations to achieve the political goal 
of forcing iraq to back down and withdraw from kuwait 
the wisconsin democrat one of several lawmakers who met with 
bush and other administration officials last week also said us 
forces deployed to the persian gulf as part of operation desert 
shield will be ready in the next several weeks for any military 
action 
earlier this week defense secretary dick cheney said he sees an 
increasing likelihood that saddam will lash out with military force 
to try to break the stranglehold of the economic embargo 
cheney said the administration had forseen that a key point of 
danger in the standoff with saddam would arise once the sanctions 
begin crippling the iraqi economy 
we may have seen in the last 48 or 72 hours the beginning 
commentary from him that would indicate that the sanctions are 
beginning to bite cheney said 
in a speech taped for us viewers saddam said us forces 
deployed in the gulf region face the prospect of bigger losses than 
those suffered by americans in the vietnam war 
we may have seen with his threats in the past couple of days 
that he may resort to military force in response to the 
sanctions cheney said

the illinois supreme court on friday upheld a 
ruling that 3yearold twins cannot be forced to be tested as 
potential bonemarrow donors for their leukemiastricken 
halfbrother 
the decision upholding a cook county circuit court ruling was 
another setback for tamas bosze and his son jeanpierre 12 whom 
doctors say might die without a marrow transplant 
cook county circuit judge monica reynolds ruled sept 6 that 
forcing the twins to take a blood test to determine whether they 
could be marrow donors for jeanpierre would violate their 
constitutional right to privacy 
boszes lawyer edward jordan said he did not know if bosze 
would appeal the case to the us supreme court his final 
recourse he said the illinois supreme court has not yet released 
the reasons for its decision 
jordan said the father and son were disappointed but that the 
decision was not totally unexpected 
in every case especially difficult cases there is as much 
chance of losing as there is of winning he said 
the twins mother nancy curran was pleased and very 
relieved said her lawyer beverly pekala 
the case moved into the courts in early july after curran of 
elk grove village refused boszes request to have the twins 
tested she contended the marrowextraction procedure which 
involves inserting a long needle into the hip bone or breast bone 
would be risky and painful 
bosze of hoffman estates is the father of the twins but he 
and curran were never married 
he and his sons mother are incompatible marrow donors for 
jeanpierre as is the boys brother and another halfsister

federal workers are being told to report for 
work monday but to be prepared to go home if theres no agreement 
between congress and the white house on how to pay them 
the instructions to go to work as usual were contained in a 
memorandum from budget director richard darman to agency heads 
friday 
in the absence of legislation to keep the government operating 
beyond the start of the new fiscal year monday nonessential 
workers would be sent home within three hours if a government 
phasedown is launched darmans memo said 
federal workers complained earlier about the confusion 
surrounding what they should do before darmans memo was released 
late in the afternoon workers were being told to listen to the 
radio over the weekend 
this is absolutely no way to run any kind of ship said john 
sturdivant president of the 700000member american federation of 
government employees 
its just ridiculous that weve always got to operate on the 
basis of crisis people dont know whether theyre supposed to go 
to work whether they have a fulltime job or what sturdivant 
said 
about 11 million federal workers received notices a month ago 
that they might be furloughed up to 22 days if automatic 
grammrudman deficit reduction budget cuts kick in on monday 
the furloughs and the phasedown are two separate threats facing 
federal workers 
most of those furloughs probably wont start until later in the 
week if no budget accord is reached the phasedown would occur 
monday if congress doesnt pass or president bush refused to sign 
temporary legislation to keep the government in operation 
if such legislation were signed but the grammrudman cuts took 
effect the furloughs probably would not start until later in the 
week 
also friday the federation sued to exempt social security 
employees from the automatic budget cuts the suit filed in us 
district court contends those 60000 workers should be excluded 
because their salaries are not paid out of general treasury funds 
instead the suit notes those workers are paid from the oldage 
and survivors insurance program which is exempt from the 
grammrudman deficitreduction act that will trigger 85 billion if 
no budget agreement is reached

the irish republican army claimed responsibility 
friday for planting a bomb at an international conference on 
terrorism in central london and said its target was a government 
minister 
the bomb was hidden in a plastic lunch box and taped to a 
lectern the speakers were to use the explosive was set to go off 
at 1030 am 30 minutes after the meeting was to begin police 
said 
the ability of the ira to target british cabinet ministers 
while less than a mile away british prime minister margaret 
thatcher holds a crisis meeting to find a way to stop ira attacks 
demonstrates the daring of the ira and its ability to strike at 
will the ira said in a statement in dublin 
police defused the bomb after it was discovered by chance by a 
sound engineer at thursdays oneday conference at the royal 
overseas league in piccadilly police and private security guards 
missed the bomb in earlier sweeps 
foreign office minister william waldegrave was due to address 
the conference waldegrave is not in the cabinet but is one of five 
deputies to foreign secretary douglas hurd 
the iras statement said an active service unit had 
succeeded in breaching security to place a bomb at the royal 
overseas league conference 
the ira statement was issued to a dublin news agency and signed 
with the iras traditional nom de guerre p oneill 
mrs thatcher was meeting with her cabinet at her official 
residence in downing street when the bomb was discovered 
londons police chief sir peter imbert also was scheduled to 
address the conference commander george churchillcoleman head of 
scotland yards antiterrorist squad said the sophisticated device 
contained enough plastic explosives to kill the the speaker and 
other people as well 
waldegrave was to have been the first speaker but a change in 
his schedule forced a lastminute switch to the afternoon 
an unidentified ira spokesman was quoted in a london newspaper 
on saturday as vowing to escalate attacks in mainland britain in 
its fight to end british rule in northern ireland 
they are rattled and as long as they persist with their 
illogical and illegal claim to ireland we will not only continue 
to rattle them but will rattle them harder the ira spokesman 
told the independent newspaper 
in the northern ireland capital belfast police blamed the ira 
for planting four explosive devices packed in radio cassette 
holders 
two of the devices exploded early friday in a shop and a 
restaurant causing no injuries the other two were spotted by 
department store clerks and defused police said

seventyfour percent of chicagos innercity 
children have witnessed a slaying shooting stabbing or robbery 
according to a study and experts worry about the impact such 
violence has on youngsters mental health 
people think if theyre chronically exposed to this kind of 
violence kids adapt to it said dr carl bell a psychiatrist at 
the university of illinois school of medicine but theyre wrong 
if children who witness crimes appear withdrawn or silent its a 
symptom of the damage they just shut off 
the survey of more than 1000 elementary and high school 
children on chicagos south side found that of students who 
witnessed violent crimes in about half the cases the victim was a 
friend family member or neighbor in addition 46 percent of the 
students reported that they had been victims of violent crimes 
themselves 
and the victims arent receiving the attention and counseling 
they need said bell also head of the community mental health 
council which conducted the survey 
there are basically three areas where people impacted by 
witnessing violence show up in the criminal justice system in 
the mental health system or as a problem with the board of 
education bell said 
he said witnessing or being a victim of violence teaches that 
violence is a way to address problems as a result the youths 
often have difficulty dealing with their own aggression bell said 
you also see elements of nihilism he said if you see 
people getting killed you start to think that dying soon is 
inevitable some kids get chronically depressed withdrawn 
he said officials need to develop a consistent policy on dealing 
with the children 
they could develop from that a cadre of professionals able to 
deal with homicides and other community violence like shootings or 
stabbings bell said 
thats also true in detroit said anne milkodelpier 
program coordinator for detroits family bereavement center 
there are not a lot of professionals who are trained to deal with 
kids who witness violent crimes like homicides 
milkodelpier said detroits court system refers families of 
homicide victims under the age of 21 to the center a program run 
by a nonprofit private social services agency called the childrens 
center 
she also said she was surprised at the chicago surveys figures 
adding she believes the number of children witnessing violent 
crimes in detroit is definitely lower although no study has been 
done 
officials in philadelphia also could offer no comparable figures 
on children who witness violent crimes but the number is probably 
increasing said kemi adeleye a director at families of murder 
victims which deals with some of the young witnesses 
homicide crimes are getting quite common around here said 
adeleye whose agency is associated with the philadelphia district 
attorneys office but many say they just kind of get used to it 
its probably not so much that they get used to violent crimes but 
rather it becomes such a frequent thing that they are no longer as 
shocked by it

four east european countries regarded as 
military foes of the west barely a year ago have offered assistance 
to the international military force defending saudi arabia and 
enforcing un sanctions against iraq the us state department 
said friday 
poland czechoslovakia and romania have offered medical 
facilities and bulgaria said it will provide 400 soldiers the 
department said 
we welcome these offers which demonstrate the solidarity of 
the international community in opposing iraqi aggression the 
statement said it added that it was up to saudi arabia whether to 
accept the offers 
the president of bulgaria zhelyu zhelev met president bush 
friday after earlier telling reporters his country has intended to 
contribute ground troops from the outset of the gulf crisis but 
delayed out of concern for aggravating the hardships of 700 
bulgarian workers trapped in iraq and iraqioccupied kuwait 
zhelev said bulgaria would act soon to dispatch the military 
unit and was making contact with saudi arabia through us 
officials 
czechoslovakia like bulgaria has no diplomatic relations with 
saudi arabia its foreign minister jiri dienstbier told the 
washington foreign affairs council friday his country is prepared 
to send a team of chemical warfare specialists and a field hospital 
to the gulf 
first we have to be invited he said adding czechoslovakia 
would welcome it if the un security council issued a blanket 
invitation to all nations to form a un peacekeeping force 
dienstbiers aides said the czechoslovak team could include up to 
200 personnel including doctors nurses and specialists in 
treating injuries caused by poison gas which iraq has stockpiled 
and in 1988 used against its kurdish minority

what happened is still under investigation and the cause has 
not been determined kokaisel said 
a de jean king sr area director of the occupational safety 
and health administration said his investigators were at the scene 
but it was too early to pinpoint the source of the leak or the 
materials involved 
kokaisel identified the dead workers as john hosey 52 the crew 
foreman and bertram bass 27 
he said four other workers were treated at area hospitals and 
released two were admitted to simpson general hospital for

time of the accident said kokaisel

the leaking gases may have included natural gas liquid nitrogen 
and liquid hydrogen all toxic 
kokaisel said he could not confirm what gases were involved but 
added that those three are all used at the plant

the big apple is going through its autumnal rite 
of safeguarding and entertaining the worlds potentates and 
premiers as they arrive for the un general assembly 
their numbers are swollen this year by the persian gulf crisis 
and the un world summit for children 
seventyone world leaders including president bush are 
scheduled to attend the twoday summit for children beginning 
saturday 
its billed as the largest gathering ever of world leaders 
on friday several of them zipped around the city president 
patricio aylwin of chile speaking at a foreign affairs forum 
japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu picking up an honorary degree 
at new york university queen fabiola of belgium visiting the 
covenant house shelter for young runaways 
some of the topranking officials expected in town are staying 
at their countrys un missions for the rest and their often 
large entourages hotels readied welcomes 
our indianapolis 500 was the way jim mastrangelo sales 
manager of the united nations plaza hotel described the coming 
days 
but cars at low or no speed were what city officials fretted 
about 
this will be the largest number of world dignitaries assembled 
in new york at one time said city transportation commissioner 
lucius riccio there is the potential for a very large 
international gridlock 
many places where the diplomats go demonstrators are bound to 
follow about a score of protests and rallies pegged to un events 
are planned 
and the city will have its usual complement of unrelated 
distractions for example a dinner for the italian foreign 
minister is scheduled saturday night at a trendy downtown 
restaurant coowned by movie star robert deniro 
but should any dignitary decide to pop into a fastfood joint 
for a quick afternoon snack they could run into the coalition to 
liberate animals worldwide the coalition intends making things 
uncomfortable for meateaters at various chain eateries in midtown 
another potential for snarled traffic is that motorcades could 
meet moviemakers three feature films are being shot on the streets 
of manhattan and a fourth in brooklyn 
police plan to set up traffic freezes for no one but president 
bush he is expected saturday and will address the united nations 
on monday 
a freeze immobilizes everything vehicles and pedestrians 
along the presidents route and while police say freezes will be 
no more than 15 minutes they have been known to last an hour 
shoppers at the swank bergdorf goodman for men witnessed a sweep 
thursday by phalanxes of security men in advance of a browse by a 
foreign bigwig 
theyre big shoppers said elizabeth maguire speaking for 
the plaza hotel where suzan mubarak wife of the egyptian 
president and other international guests are staying 
but the rumor is that theyve all been clued into secaucus 
she added referring to a bustling discount center across the 
hudson river in new jersey 
police presence in midtown will escalate through the weekend 
with roundtheclock details of as many as 900 officers on duty 
saturday 950 sunday and 1600 monday 
amid the elaborate precautions for the summit on saving the 
worlds children a dark counterpoint was the continued 
vulnerability of new york citys youth to violence 
nine children have been shot in the city since sunday the 
latest a 13yearold who died when a gun went off as it was being 
passed among his friends in the last two months seven children 
have died of random gunshots

a federal jury on friday ordered a 
manufacturer of room partitions to pay 51 million in connection 
with a 1986 new years eve arson fire that killed 97 hotel guests 
the us district court jury found air wall inc guilty of nine 
counts of negligence and 10 counts of failure to warn users about 
possible hazards associated with its foamfilled dividers at the 
dupont plaza hotel 
it was not immediately clear what potential hazards were cited 
by the jury which decided the walls contributed to the fastmoving 
fire linked to a labor dispute in puerto ricos most populous city 
in a separate trial three former hotel employees were convicted 
of murder in 1987 for setting the fire to pressure management to 
give into union demands the union itself has denied any 
responsibility 
the fire broke out in a ballroom on the first floor of the 
22story hotel and most of the victims were trapped in the casino 
the beachside hotel which has still not reopened was filled with 
nearly 1000 guests at the time also 140 people were injured 
air wall was acquitted of 17 other counts including all 12 
counts of productive defectiveness 
five other companies that supplied rugs dressers and foam 
cushions used by the hotel were acquitted of all charges following 
seven days of jury deliberations to end the 15month trial 
defense attorney harold vicente said air wall would appeal to 
the first circuit of appeals in boston on grounds of confusion 
among the jurors 
if the product was not defective what did we have to warn 
about vicente said following the verdict 
it was second phase of one of the largest disasterrelated 
lawsuits in us history 
the first phase ended in may 1989 when judge raymond l acosta 
accepted a 100 million settlement of hundreds of individual 
lawsuits stemming from the dec 31 1986 
judge acosta now must decide whether to go ahead with the third 
phase of the trial which entails suits and countersuits filed by 
some of the firms and insurers or proceed to the remaining 264 
individual suits 
fridays verdict stemmed from 12 lawsuits filed against hotel 
suppliers by survivors and relatives of people killed in the fire 
wyomingbased air wall manufactured portable styrofoamfilled 
partitions used on the floor of the hotel ballroom 
the jury determined the four companies that have owned air wall 
at various times since 1962 must share in paying damages they are 
white consolidated industries inc aircoustic wall manufacturing 
co acw airwall inc and hufcor inc 
hector martinez a lawyer for the four firms said the appeal 
would be based on jurors confusion caused by the complicated 
nature of the case and the voluminous trial documentation he said 
there were about 15000 pages of testimony alone 
i think i have a very good argument for appeal and i am very 
pleased with the result vicente agreed 
he explained that he had expected a much higher damage award 
originally the suits filed against his clients totaled 25 
million 
lawyers for the plaintiffs also said they were satisfied with 
the jury award 
attorney francisco troncoso said the award breaks ground for 
settlements in the individual cases are tried 
companies cleared by the jury of liability were drexel heritage 
furnishings industries of north carolina dan river inc of 
virginia lewis industries inc of california foss manufacturing 
company inc of massaschussetts and wolf gordon inc of new york 
drexel heritage was the supplier of dressers that were stored in 
the ballroom at the time of the fire dan river wolf gordo and 
foss supplied rugs used on the walls and floor of the ballroom and 
lewis industries was the manufacturer of the foam used to fill sofa 
cushions stored in the ballroom 
the fourth and final phase of the litigation concerns suits 
filed by the owners of the hotel against the teamsters union

talks broke down friday evening between 
student activists demanding sweeping improvements at the university 
of the district columbia and school and city officials trying to 
end a threeday student takeover of university buildings 
attorneys representing the students said they were angered by 
remarks made by mayor marion barry after emerging from talks with 
student leaders 
the students say they are not receiving a quality education and 
have demanded the resignation of most of the schools board of 
trustees 
barry said negotiations had failed because attorneys for the 
students were taking a hard line stance against the university 
the mayor said he was frustrated by the lack of progress and has 
no plans to return to the campus unless the negotiations are 
salvaged 
charles pearson one of the attorneys barry said was holding up 
a resolution said we will not back down because someone 
slanders our integrity we will not sell the students out 
the students said they will not end their protests despite 
statements by school officials that they are prepared to resume 
regular classes on monday 
they vowed to retain control of two campus buildings until a 
majority of the schools trustees resign 
for the first time in a long time the city is going to get a 
new administration student protest leader mark thompson said 
theres no reason why the university shouldnt start anew as 
well 
thompson and other students met with the 15member trustee 
panel city council members and barry in an attempt to resolve an 
impasse that began wednesday the students chief demand is that 11 
of the trustees resign 
barry and the council approve recommendations for the nonpaying 
posts but are powerless to force a trustee to quit 
i support what those young people up there want said 
city council member harry thomas after emerging from a 90minute 
meeting with a group of students i support them 100 percent 
the students claim the board has taken a number of actions that 
have threatened the quality of education at udc a public 
institution with an enrollment of about 12000 
students took over a campus building wednesday saying they were 
upset about several trustee actions including a plan to spend 16 
million for renovations to a library so a controversial artwork 
the dinner party can be installed there 
students said the money could be better spent in improving 
academic programs several udc departments have had problems 
maintaining their accreditations

the attorney for an inmate under 
investigation in the slayings of five college students failed to 
get a gag order on friday silencing public suspicion by police 
prosecutors and the news media 
stephen michael bates facing burglary and assault charges in a 
separate case has not been charged in the multiple student 
slayings in gainesville but has been named as a possible suspect 
we dont feel he did it we feel theyre in a position to 
clear him or not clear him they havent done it said polk 
county assistant public defender robert norgard i feel hes just 
being used 
circuit judge j tim strickland rejected the gag order request 
but said norgard was free to file the motion again later 
what we are going to do is see what happens as far as 
publicity norgard said in a telephone interview 
bates 30 is accused of armed burglary aggravated assault and 
battery in polk county and is being held on 100500 bond he 
allegedly broke into a womans home and threatened her and her 
daughter with a knife 
bates probably will go to trial in january and could face up to 
life in prison if convicted his attorney said 
if you were facing a criminal charge that normally wouldnt 
draw any publicity and you were listed as a suspect in the 
gainesville murders you wouldnt feel too comfortable norgard 
said the mere fact of being mentioned as a suspect is pretty 
negative 
gainseville authorities have listed bates as one of eight 
possible suspects in the student killings but no charges have been 
filed 
the only other suspect identified by investigators is edward 
lewis humphrey 18 jailed in brevard county on 1 million bail on 
unrelated charges stemming from a beating suffered by his 
grandmother his trial is scheduled for early october 
the nude mutilated bodies of sonja larson 18 and christina 
powell 17 were found in their gainesville apartment aug 26 
hours later the decapitated body of christina hoyt 17 was 
discovered the bodies of manuel taboada and tracy paules both 23 
were found aug 28 in the apartment they shared 
several news organizations retained tampa lawyer carol locicero 
to fight any gag order which she has said would be 
unconstitutional prior restraint

matter is resolved 
abcs primetime live reported thursday that it used hidden 
cameras to record examples of unsanitary conditions and poor 
patient care during three days at the wade park va hospital 
the hospitals chief of staff dr murray altose blasted the 
report as unfair 
im saying it isnt substantiated and its grossly 
distorted altose said its not the way things are at this 
medical center that picture was a grossly distorted representation 
thats full of patently erroneous allegations 
rep mary rose oakar dohio said house veterans affairs 
committee chairman gv sonny montgomery dmiss has agreed to 
investigate the allegations 
sen john glenn dohio also called for veterans affairs 
secretary ed derwinski to investigate and sen howard metzenbaum 
dohio said the hospitals director dr peter stajduhar should 
be suspended until the issue is resolved 
primetime live reported that among other things 
bloodstained needles were not disposed of properly asbestos was 
removed near patient quarters and one paralyzed patient was not fed 
for three days 
altose said that there are likely to be some failings in the 
quality of medical care in any large hospital dealing with 
seriously ill patients 
he also said it was improper to draw conclusions based on the 
brief video shown in the report 
the cleveland hospital was selected for the investigation 
because it was a typical representation of the care at va 
hospitals abc spokeswoman rena terracuso said 
altose said the allegations would be investigated and a va 
medical inspector would visit the hospital 
we welcome that visit he said we trust that he will look 
at in depth the goings on in this place and establish clearly as 
we contend that there is absolutely nothing to hide there are not 
terrible things going on this is in fact a fine medical center

a gunman who killed a college student in a 
hostage standoff apparently stockpiled his weapons legally despite 
a history of criminal and mental problems officials said friday 
mehrdad dashti was killed thursday by police after a night of 
terror and sexual perversion at a popular student tavern near the 
university of california in berkeley 
the attack by the heavily armed man prompted calls for tighter 
gun control either this man with a history of being severely 
mentally disturbed was able to go in and legally buy a gun or 
someone bought them for him and the gun registration laws arent 
worth the paper theyre written on said berkeley mayor loni 
hancock 
dashti 30 shared an apartment with fred smith who described 
him as a devout moslem who kept a 9mm semiautomatic pistol a 
45caliber handgun a 22caliber pistol and a semiautomatic 
rifle 
dashti seized control of henrys publick house amp grille at the 
durant hotel where he held 33 people hostage armed with three 
pistols and firing intermittently he wounded several people and 
killed uc berkeley student john nicholas sheehy 22 
he harangued american women as slutty and singled out blonde 
women for sexual abuse he forced them to drop their pants and 
directed male hostages to sexually molest them with carrots he 
brought with him said phil kim an architecture student who 
escaped early in the siege 
yes it happened said a 26yearold female hostage this 
guy came up to me and apologized i told him not to worry we kind 
of faked it i think most everyone else did too it was beyond 
horrible 
the standoff ended when police stormed the bar and killed 
dashti of the nine people dashti wounded four remained 
hospitalized friday listed in good condition 
the iranianborn killer emigrated to the united states in the 
late 1970s and established permanent residency status by marrying 
an american woman in 1984 they divorced in 1987 
smith 19 said the guns worried him at first but dashti 
assured him he was just a collector and that all were registered 
the roomate said he didnt know about dashtis mental problems or 
criminal record 
among dashtis papers was a county health department document 
saying he had been diagnsed as a paranoid schizophrenic and was 
limited in his ability to think clearly interact with others 
appropriately and control his impulses 
a bottle of the medication stelazine used for psychotics was 
found in his bathroom 
dashti sent registered letters to president bush us supreme 
court chief justice william rehnquist and san francisco mayor art 
agnos complaining that his brain was being used as some kind of 
communications device radiolike and the messages that are to be 
broadcasted out are sent to my mind and sent out from there 
the letters to bush and rehnquist did not contain specific 
threats and dashti was never investigated by the secret service 
said agent gene thompson in san francisco 
he kept photocopies of those letters and others he wrote to the 
local fbi the head of the federal department of health and human 
services and the authority in charge 
according to alameda county probation officials dashti said 
hed heard the voices of demons before he was arrested in 1988 
for ramming 48 cars in berkeley and albany with his car 
dashti was wanted by san francisco police for investigation of 
grand theft and other charges for allegedly trying to withdraw 
16000 from a bank account authorities said he helped set up last 
year with stolen checks dashti also was convicted for petty theft 
in 1979 and 1983 
neither the alleged felonies nor the misdemeanor convictions 
would have made it illegal for dashti to buy guns 
similar calls for increased gun controls followed the january 
1989 schoolyard massacre in stockton but laws passed afterward 
affected only assault rifles not handguns like those wielded by 
dashti 
this terrible tragedy shows that the laws and the system are 
failing hancock said

the forest service on friday adopted a plan to 
protect the northern spotted owl that northwest lawmakers said will 
cause greater cuts in logging than the white house predicted last 
week 
the service said it will follow guidelines put forth by forest 
service biologist jack ward thomas in april at that time the 
service estimated the thomas plan would cause northwest federal 
timber harvests to fall by nearly 50 percent and result in the loss 
of more than 20000 jobs 
president bush backed a white house task force last week that 
said the owl could be saved from extinction by reducing next years 
harvests by only about 20 percent from this years 385 billion 
board feet to about 3 billion board feet 
rep denny smith rore a backer of the timber industry and 
critic of thomas said the new announcement on friday means 
harvests will tumble to about 26 billion board feet 
while the task force might have come forward saying we will 
cut 32 billion board feet this means we have just accepted 26 
billion this is just a further cavein to the folks that are 
trying to put us out of business smith said 
the action came as environmentalists were preparing to return to 
federal court in seattle to try to force the federal agency to 
accept a scientifically sound plan to protect the owls habitat in 
the northwests oldgrowth forests 
the fish and wildlife service declared the rare owl a threatened 
species under the endangered species act on june 22 lawmakers said 
the thomas proposal would be the most sweeping protection of 
wildlife in the history of the act banning logging on 3 million 
acres of national forests currently open to harvests an area 
larger than the state of maryland

the oregon supreme court on friday restored 
five voter initiative measures to the nov 6 ballot reversing a 
ruling that had disqualified them on a technicality 
the state high court announced its unanimous decision after 
hearing arguments on the appeal the court had no further comment 
saying written opinions would be issued at a later date 
one of the five issues put back on the ballot would allow tax 
credits for partent who sent their children to parochial schools 
marion county circuit judge richard barber ruled monday that the 
five initiatives were not eligible for the ballot because they 
lacked financial statements the statements werent included 
because of an earlier court rulings saying state officials missed a 
deadline for formally approving them 
state law requires that financial estimates be printed on 
ballots and in the state voters pamphlet for measures having a 
substantial impact on the state treasury 
other measures affected by the high court ruling would limit 
property taxes shut down the trojan nuclear plant until waste 
disposal requirements are met ban some nonrecyclable packaging 
and set up a pilot work program for welfare applicants 
in a secondary ruling the supreme court upheld the earlier 
court decisions that had struck financial impact statements from 
three measures on grounds officials missed a deadline for approving 
them 
lawyers for backers of some measures told the supreme court the 
publics initiative rights shouldnt be breached because of 
procedural mistakes by the government 
mike reynolds an assistant attorney general said the fiscal 
statement law is ambiguous and should be construed so as not to 
abort the right of initiative 
but robert durham a lawyer for foes of the tax measures said 
voters have a material right to have financial statements the 
measures his clients oppose have potentially catastrophic 
multibillion dollar impacts he said 
elections officials have said the fiscal statements might be 
posted in voting booths as a substitute for having them on the 
ballot or in the voters pamphlet

the military government friday dismissed 
as exaggerations reports about international reaction to detentions 
and interrogations of burmese staff at some foreign embassies 
a foreign ministry statement broadcast on state radio and 
television was issued in response to radio reports about the action 
at the british us and australian embassies 
the british broadcasting corp and the voice of america reported 
friday that protests were filed by the 12 members of the european 
community and other countries including japan canada and the 
united states 
but the burmese statement said the protests were filed 
separately by the nations since last week 
the broadcast gave the impression that the international 
community was collectively protesting the legal measures taken by 
the burmese government the foreign ministry statement said 
it is regrettable to note that what should have been a simple 
diplomatic exercise by a few diplomats in the rnngoon diplomatic 
corps has become grossly exaggerated it said 
a diplomat in bangkok thursday said the burmese government had 
detained burmese staff of the australian british and us 
embassies 
he also said armed troops entered the compound of the west 
german embassy last week and that similar action had been taken a 
number of times against us and british diplomatic compounds 
in washington thursday state department spokesman richard 
boucher said the united states had strongly protested after burmese 
officials detained and interrogated four employees of the us 
embassy 
the military government has detained large numbers of dissidents 
since it seized power in 1988 by crushing a democracy movement

the texas system of electing district judges 
by countywide voting was upheld friday by a federal appeals court 
that said questions about possibly diluted minority voting strength 
do not apply 
protections against diluting the voting power of minorities have 
no bearing on the election of judges because they are not public 
servants the 5th us circuit court of appeals ruled 121 
judge sam d johnson of austin texas in a scathing 47page 
dissent wrote the majority opinion is not simply wrong it is 
dangerous 
the decision affects nine texas counties but has possible 
broader applications it came hours before a similar challenge was 
to be argued in a baton rouge federal court 
another challenge is pending in georgia which is in a different 
federal appeals court circuit 
the majority opinion written by judge thomas gibbs gee of 
houston said judges unlike legislators and other elected 
officials are not public servants in fact they often must defy 
public opinion to carry out the law he wrote 
gee wrote that section 2 of the voting rights act an amendment 
passed in 1982 was a test to determine what dilutes voting 
strength but it stopped short of imposing such a test for judicial 
offices 
should congress seek to install such a test for judicial 
elections it must say so plainly he wrote instead it has 
thus far plainly said the contrary 
in his dissent johnson called the majority decision completely 
isolated from other rulings 
no previous court has ever even suggested that judicial 
elections might be exempt from the reach of section 2 of the voting 
rights act he wrote to the contrary this court had 
earlier concluded that section 2 applied to all elections 
including judicial elections 
not only does the majority opinion reverse this twoyearold 
precedent but it also demonstrates a shocking lack of concern for 
the urgently argued position of the attorney general who has 
consistently maintained that the voting rights act reaches all 
elections 
the case was brought to court by the league of united latin 
american citizens which argued that countywide voting for state 
judges in nine urban counties prevents minorities from electing the 
candidates they want 
us district judge lucius bunton of midland agreed and ordered 
the state to divide the nine counties into electoral subdistricts 
those counties dallas harris bexar tarrant travis 
lubbock midland ector and jefferson elect 172 of texas 390 
district judges 
a threejudge panel of the 5th circuit upheld the texas system 
however it then brought the case back before the entire panel for 
reconsideration thirteen of the 15 circuit court members 
participated 
an attorney for the group said theyll appeal to the supreme 
court 
we think that any election system that discriminates on the 
basis of race and ethnicity is inconsistent with the most basic 
democratic principles of our society said rolando rios of san 
antonio 
the texas and louisiana cases are virtually identical 
were just delighted with the opinion said john kennedy 
legal counsel for louisiana gov buddy roemer its a complete 
victory 
in the louisiana case us district judge john parker ordered 
that 11 districts be redesigned to enhance the chance of electing 
black judges only six of louisianas 254 district and appellate 
court judges are black 
also at issue in louisiana is a state supreme court district in 
new orleans the only district in the state represented by two 
justices elected at large 
a similar challenge in mississippi led to special judicial 
elections being held in 1989 under a federal court order 
us district judge william h barbour jr of jackson was the 
first federal judge in the nation to apply section 2 of the voting 
rights act to judicial elections his ruling which said the 
states judicial districts discriminated against blacks was upheld 
by a special threejudge federal panel appointed to review the 
decision

years of discrimination at mississippi 
state colleges are over a federal appeals court ruled friday 
the record makes clear that mississippi has adopted and 
implemented race neutral policies for operating its colleges and 
universities and that all students have real freedom of choice to 
attend the college or university they wish judge john m duhe 
jr wrote in fridays majority decision issued by the 5th us 
circuit court of appeals in new orleans 
the 104 decision by the appeals court reversed a finding by a 
threejudge panel of the 5th circuit that mississippi illegally 
operates separate universities for blacks and whites and that 
opening admissions to all races in 1962 didnt go far enough 
mississippi operates three predominantly black universities and 
five that have a majority of white students 
the late jake ayers filed the suit in 1975 on behalf of his son 
jake ayers jr then in high school and 20 other black students 
the case was closely watched in louisiana where a similar 
challenge is pending over the status of predominantly black schools 
like grambling southern and others 
william f goodman jr of jackson attorney for the state 
college board praised the ruling 
it removes the doubts about the legality of the mississippi 
system of higher education goodman said secondly the 
decision vindicates the efforts of many people over the past 20 
years who have worked so hard to integrate the system 
morris kinsey chairman of the education committee of the 
mississippi naacp said the decision creates another obstacle to 
getting more funding for black colleges 
i am stunned by this one kinsey said i guess well just 
have to take our appeal further we were concerned that when we had 
the arguments before the full court that they were not interested 
in our arguments 
justice department officials in washington who argued 
mississippi fostered discrimination through college admission 
requirements and failing to upgrade facilities at black schools 
said they were reviewing the decision and would not have any 
immediate comment 
chief judge charles clark of mississippi did not take part in 
the decision

saddam hussein is moving to transform kuwait 
into an iraqi province by altering the countrys demography 
erasing its national identity and removing its infrastructure us 
analysts say 
what we are seeing is the dekuwaitization of kuwait this is 
the history of the iraqi regime one us official said speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
the iraqi president has been changing kuwait since the aug 2

signs of the ousted government officials said every passing day 
takes the country further away from what it once was

manila philippines ap a court today convicted 16 soldiers

acquittal of 20 people in the 1983 slaying of sen benigno 
ninoy aquino the countrys top opposition leader at the time 
other defendants including a former military chief of staff

washington ap soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is 
wielding less and less power and is in danger of becoming 
irrelevant as restive soviet republics wrest authority from the 
central government a senior administration official says 
the official insisting on anonymity said thursday that 
gorbachevs loss of power is a bigger threat to him than any coup 
by the military rumors of a military takeover have surfaced in 
moscow in recent days but the senior official discounted that 
possibility 
it is highly unusual that a government official even when 
guaranteed protection against being identified would offer such a 
candid and damaging assessment of a world leader of gorbachevs 
stature 
moreover the portrayal of gorbachev as a faltering figure 
clashes with the picture that president bush tried to project when 
he flew thousands of miles to helsinki this month to stand 
alongside the soviet president in a demonstration that the 
superpowers are united against iraq in the persian gulf crisis

does it make sense to penalize the middle class 
in order to deny the wealthy 
elected officials argued in recent weeks that to accede to 
president bushs wish and lower the maximum capital gains tax to 15 
percent from 28 percent would disproportionately benefit the rich 
that would never do they said 
what many opponents failed to explain is that a lower tax also 
would benefit the hardworking middle class including many 
farmers owners of small businesses small investors and various 
other lessthanrich americans 
it would help farmers who built up a valuable property from 
nothing and who now wish to retire homeowners whose financial 
gains on a property sale exceed the deductible limit entrepreneurs 
who created value out of an idea 
the big investor would benefit from lower taxes but so would 
the investor who put 3000 into stocks in 1985 saw them grow 
to 3500 in 1990 and who after taxes commissions and inflation 
has about a 180 profit 
had that person put the money in a relatively riskless savings 
account earning just over 5 percent annually the aftertax 
afterinflation profit might have been more than double that 
this is but one example of inconsistencies in the capital gains 
debate during which the issue became so embroiled in politics that 
several of the important financial and social implications were 
lost 
it takes capital investments for example to develop new 
businesses which create wealth provide jobs and eventually grow 
large enough to compete with larger companies thus adding to 
market competition and fair pricing 
it takes people with ideas too and often those people do not 
have the capital unlike existing businesses that have ready access 
to capital from pension funds the beginners must beg for capital 
and they must offer something in return 
what they offer investors is a reasonable hope that the company 
will succeed and repay them for accepting the risk and the 
longterm commitment of their funds 
in the capital gains debate profit was mentioned far more than 
risk but profit is never assured in capital investments whereas 
risk is risk means the possibility of loss and that possibility 
is high small companies often fail 
there has to be a good inducement therefore for investors to 
commit money to risky but economically and socially worthwhile 
ventures but taxes and longterm inflation beginners will tell 
you sometimes destroy that inducement 
throughout the debate references were made to the taxdeferred 
aspect of capital investments but less was said about the 
longterm commitment of those funds which of course precludes 
their use in any other way 
that issue might seem minor but that commitment of funds can be 
for a lifetime during which the investor might build a large 
operation but have a relatively small income his wealth is 
committed it cannot be withdrawn 
perhaps the most positive result of the debate was to clarify 
the meaning of profit if profit really was what it was defined as 
being by otherwise informed people then everyone would be rich 
inflation they said was profit 
on reflection everyone understands that inflation is a minus 
it is deducted from profit ten percent inflation wipes out a 5 
percent wage increase and leaves you with a 5 percent loss not a 
profit 
somehow that reasoning was not always applied to capital gains 
where inflation was called profit even by political leaders who 
claimed to have thoroughly analyzed the issue in fact inflation 
was actually taxed as profit 
that irony at least has been clarified

an aging communist has reopened one of the darkest 
chapters of italys postwar history charging that his party was 
behind a threeyear reign of terror in a region dubbed the 
triangle of death 
the communist otello montanari has accused his party of 
covering up its members role in the hundreds of killings that 
plagued northcentral italy for years after dictator benito 
mussolini was killed 
he also revealed that the communist party helped the killers 
flee to czechoslovakia 
in response to his charges the communist party has finally 
admitted it bore some responsibility for the rash of slayings in 
the socalled triangle of death 
the disclosures by montanari 65 have shocked many italians and 
led to a reevaluation of the antifascist resistance one of the 
countrys most revered ideals 
the debate has also widened a split in the wests largest 
communist party already reeling from the collapse of communism in 
eastern europe 
fortyfive years have gone by its time to attentively judge 
these affairs it is necessary for democracy for the resistance 
montanari said in an aug 28 letter to a bologna newspaper that 
sparked the debate 
the triangle of death was part of the red zone of northern 
italy even today it is dominated by the communist party the 
countrys secondbiggest party 
when mussolini was killed in april 1945 communists and other 
resistance fighters went on a twomonth orgy of revenge at least 
12000 people most suspected of supporting fascism were slain 
before a new government restored order 
but in the triangle of death bounded by the cities of modena 
reggio emilia and bologna the killings continued for another 
three years hundreds more people were slain including former 
fascist officials factory managers landowners and roman catholic 
priests 
montanari a former partisan and party leader in reggio emilia 
charged some communist officials in the area had an attitude of 
tolerance of coveringup and even of close cooperation with the 
killers 
whoever knows about it must speak he appealed 
his call has led to an outpouring of new details in national 
newspapers and on television from communists and relatives of 
victims some breaking decades of silence 
their accounts as well as newly publicized academic research 
indicate communist expartisans carried out many of the killings 
they depict a communist party leadership that publicly blamed 
exfascists for the murders but secretly helped scores of those 
responsible to escape to yugoslavia and then czechoslovakia which 
had come under communist rule 
it has been the end of a myth said ennio dinolfo a 
professor at the university of florence who has written a book 
about italian history from 194353 the party did its best to 
keep this hidden 
the disclosures have sometimes been painful for a country that 
often seems to gloss over its fascist past while enshrining the 
resistance 
it was italys one claim to respectability after the war 
noted oxford university historian denis mack smith a specialist on 
italy 
the new accusations have particularly angered the older 
hardline members of the communist party many took part in the 
resistance which included a large number of communists and other 
parties 
to repudiate the resistance means to destroy the principal 
pillar on which the civil coexistence of the postwar period is 
built said five party officials all former partisans in a 
statement 
two thousand people gathered in reggio emilia on sept 8 for a 
silent march to protest a hastily called congress by neofascists 
to reexamine the killings in the triangle of death 
hands off the resistance read one of their signs 
the communists emphasize that their postwar leader palmiro 
togliatti condemned the violence in the triangle of death 
but the young reformers who now dominate the italian communist 
party or pci have called for glasnost and a reexamination of 
the period 
the initiative of otello montanari brings to light the 
responsibility of the pci and of its leadership and we must 
reflect on this said piero fassino the partys director of 
organization 
part of the controversy about the killings is why the 
information has only emerged now more than a decade after scholars 
began discovering it 
some observers say the younger communists are trying to use the 
disclosures to discredit their older rivals who oppose efforts to 
reform the party and drop the communist name 
others say the information has emerged because the communists 
fear czechoslovakias new democratic government might have made 
some of it public soon 
giorgio bocca a newspaper columnist and author of several books 
on postwar italy said the scandal is tied to the decline of the 
communist party in recent years 
when the pci was strong everybody shut up even the 
middleclass newspapers he said in a telephone interview 
he and others say that the dominant christian democrat party 
worked closely with the opposition communists in the past and 
didnt want to embarrass them

the idealism that cushioned east 
europeans through last years democratic upheavals has begun to 
wane but a small group of americans is hoping to show there is 
still a place for such dreams 
the first peace corps volunteers in eastern europe are infecting 
hungarians with some of the idealism on which america has 
prospered 
for hungarians and other east europeans the initial euphoria at 
throwing off four decades of communism has given way to gloom as 
people struggle to make ends meet amid inflation unemployment and 
the vageries of a new political and economic system 
the 57 enthusiastic peace corps volunteers are teaching a 
valuable skill that will help break down four decades of cold war 
barriers they also will help alleviate a sense of isolation 
inevitable after 40 years of soviet domination antiwestern 
propaganda and restricted travel 
bonita plymale 39 who has been assigned to a new 
teachertraining college said she thought hungarians also felt cut 
off because their language is unrelated to any of the main european 
language families and difficult to learn 
dave billett 27 a volunteer at a dilapidated school on 
budapests csepel island a workers district said the contact 
with americans enabled hungarians to see that the basic human 
and societal problems are the same in the west 
hungarian teachers have told volunteers they gain confidence 
from conversation with native english teachers behind the iron 
curtain english teachers themselves often have never spoken to 
native speakers 
for the peace corps the assignments in hungary and poland 
fulfill what director paul coverdell says was a longstanding goal 
of bringing us skills and culture to eastern europe 
the cold war kept the peace corps out for four decades 
now the wall is down and the peace corps is clambering over 
it coverdell said in an interview at the organizations cramped 
budapest office 
the volunteers who took up teaching posts in every county in 
hungary in september were all ages and from varied backgrounds but 
they were united in a desire to contribute to hungarys struggle to 
get equal with the west in democratic principles and opportunities 
plymale traced her motivation for leaving highland high school 
in albuquerque nm after 17 years to the ideals of the 1960s 
when the peace corps got off the ground 
i think there are many people in the united states who are 
taking stock of what theyre doing and maybe going back to some of 
the ideals we had in the late 60s and early 70s she said 
another reason she cited is likely to surprise hungarians 
dazzled by the variety of goods available in the west to consumers 
who can afford to buy them 
plymale who headed her schools english department for the last 
six years said she wanted to get away from worrying about how 
much money im making 
coverdell said interest in the peace corps has increased 
dramatically recently partly as a result of rapid changes around 
the world 
it was president bush who proposed during his visit to hungary 
in july 1989 that peace corps volunteers come to hungary and 
poland 
coverdell said he hopes the organization which has about 7000 
volunteers in africa asia and central and south america will send 
people soon to most countries in the former east bloc 
a peace corps program is to begin in prague czechoslovakia in 
november coverdell said bulgaria and yugoslavia are also 
interested in english teachers 
in romania a team is looking at childrens health to determine 
whether the peace corps could be of assistance 
laszlo vida a senior hungarian education ministry official 
said he hopes to see the peace corps program expanded 
we are very pleased to have the peace corps here vida said 
students appeared to echo that enthusiasm 
on the second day of class children in his secondary school 
begged him to stay beyond the twoyear peace corps assignment 
billett said 
plymale and billett a freelance tv production manager in 
hollywood before he joined the peace corps both said that in 
addition to telling hungarians about the united states they had a 
lot to learn from the hungarians 
plymale said she found the hungarian educational system 
excellent and hoped to learn new techniques 
billett who is eager to learn hungarian was impressed with 
stories he has heard from hungarians about their experience of the 
past 40 years 
despite the hardship he said they still have a sense of 
humor

the most delightful program on television 
tuesday night is a mysterycomedyespionage thriller about a 
mildmannered astronomer who tracks down a kgbfinanced spy ring 
its the true story of clifford stoll a tale of suspense high 
technology international intrigue wonderful sight gags even a 
shower scene and its the season premiere of nova pbs fine 
science documentary series 
the kgb the computer and me is stolls account reenacted 
by him and the other people involved of his twoyear hunt for a 
computer hacker who had systematically penetrated the us network 
of military and academic computers 
in august 1986 stoll was a stock comic figure of academe a 
scientist whose grant had expired with his wiry shock of dark hair 
and laidback wardrobe he looks more like a grateful dead fan 
which he is than an astronomer 
fortunately for him and the lawrence berkeley laboratory at the 
university of california at berkeley the lab needed a manager for 
its computer system and he was hired 
on his first day in his new job the boss asks him to track down 
a 75cent discrepancy in the computer billing report 
thousands of dollars of charges off by 75 cents didnt sound 
like much stoll noted but it was an interesting problem a 
big error would mean an obvious bug in the system easy to find and 
fix 
but 75 cents that was a challenge 
and thereby hangs a fascinating story about science scientists 
and the business of doing science 
the 75cent error eventually led stoll to the electronic 
fingerprints of a hacker whod used a personal computer and 
telephone connection to break into the berkeley computer system 
from far away 
he was really like a burglar who knows a few ways to 
burglarize a house and uses them over and over again stoll 
recounted in a telephone interview he tries the front door the 
back door and pushes on a couple of windows and when he cant get 
in he moves on 
he figures sooner or later ill find one where somebody left 
the key in the door 
tight computer security like burglar bars on windows make 
the environment more difficult for its legitimate occupants as 
well as potential invaders the hacker was exploiting the systems 
openness 
once inside the computer the hacker used standard programming 
techniques to exploit a bug in the computers operating system 
and take it over 
invisibly the hacker had made himself a superuser able to 
read write erase and remove any file in the program 
stoll was angry and appalled part of the labs computer system 
is used in highenergy radiation therapy for certain brain tumors 
the hacker was fooling with computer programs that aim heavy 
radiation into living peoples brains 
when you screw around with systems that you dont know about 
you cant predict what the effects will be stoll said he 
thought he knew and he didnt 
it would have been a simple matter to lock out the hacker fix 
the bug in the system and wrap things up but stoll wanted to catch 
him or her or it 
and to his growing concern the hacker was using the lawrence 
berkeley computer to move around on the network of university and 
nonclassified defense department computers around the country 
the hacker was intruding into military databases defense 
contractors even the pentagon true none of the material was 
classified but it also wasnt the kind of information you read in 
the newspapers either 
stoll went to the fbi a 75cent error they werent interested 
stolls quest ultimately led him to various threeletter 
agencies that included the cia and the ultrasecret nsa 
it was frustrating to find people who really are bureaucrats 
who very much want to help but cant because of the structure of 
where they work stoll said 
the rumors that you hear are true the government would like 
to help you but it cant it just doesnt know how he said 
stoll persisted and his efforts eventually led to the arrest 
trial and conviction of a group of west german hackers with links 
to the kgb stoll even testified at their trial 
the story he reenacts and his equally fascinating book about 
the case the cuckoos egg are about science stoll insists 
a lot of the time we think the idea of science is to come up 
with answers he said that is so bogus 
if youre doing good science you dont care what the answer 
is you want to find the process the method you passionately want 
to find the procedure it seems to me the work i did in catching 
this hacker would have been just as satisfying if it had turned out 
to be some teenager down the block 
 
elsewhere in television 
the american experience pbss excellent documentary series 
the american experience starts tonight with lindbergh a 
onehour portrait of the great aviator that tries to look beyond 
the legend and find the man 
narrated by stacy keach the program features seldom seen 
archival footage and photos and new interviews with his wife the 
often reclusive anne morrow lindbergh and two of the lindberghs 
children

elections for the nations 435 house seats are 
likely to yield only slight shifts in power but analysts caution 
that this years voting could be among the most volatile and 
unpredictable in years 
novembers balloting will follow one of the strangest 18 
months in recent political history analyst charles cook says of 
a period that has seen upheavals in eastern europe the persian 
gulf domestic issues and the american economy 
few are willing to bet on where it all will lead but most 
analysts and operatives are guessing that democrats will pad their 
258to176 majority by less than 10 seats 
in normal times that would be a facesaving outcome for 
republicans as the party in control of the white house the gop 
historically could expect to lose 15 or more house seats in an 
offyear election 
several factors would seem to favor the gop this time around 
president bush enjoys nearrecord popularity ratings his standing 
increased by his handling of the middle east crisis and polls show 
a general public disgust with congress which is controlled by the 
democrats 
but on the other side of the ledger the economy among the 
most powerful determinants of political fortune is headed 
downward and republicans are being forced to defend more socalled 
open seats where there is no incumbent seeking reelection 
because 11 otherwise safe gop house members are running for the 
senate or state offices 
the effect of the volatility has been to put most races into 
slow motion congress which had planned to adjourn by oct 5 so 
members could go home and campaign now is unlikely to get out of 
washington until oct 20 or so 
issues that have taken on local importance from abortion to 
taxes and the savings and loan crisis have had to compete for air 
time and headlines with developments in iraq and kuwait political 
experts say the effect will be to compress the intense part of the 
election season into the final two weeks 
for one in five house districts that will make no difference 
seventysix incumbent lawmakers 42 democrats and 34 republicans 
will coast to reelection without major party opposition 
and as has become common in house contests few of their 
colleagues have much to worry about political analysts single out 
fewer than two dozen races where the incumbent is endangered 
topping that list are reps frank annunzio dill charles 
pashayan rcalif and denny smith rore all of whom are linked 
to the 500 billion scandal over the failure of the savings and 
loan industry 
a handful of others are in trouble because of political or 
ethical problems 
rep arlan stangeland rminn got in hot water for running 
up hundreds of longdistance calls to a former female staffer on 
his official house credit card 
it was revealed that rep roy dyson dmd who accepts large 
contributions from the defense industry in his capacity as an armed 
services committee member claimed conscientious objector status 
during the vietnam war 
rep stan parris rva said during a debate with his 
democratic opponent that he opposes affirmative action because it 
is worse to discriminate against majorities than against racial 
minorities 
and always vulnerable are freshmen many of whom won narrowly in 
1988 and have yet to establish themselves firmly in their new 
seats ben jones dga george sangmeister dill bill 
sarpalius dtexas greg laughlin dtexas peter hoagland dneb 
jolene unsoeld dwash craig james rfla ron machtley rri 
and peter smith rvt 
most of the action and the attention of democratic and 
republican party operatives focuses on the 29 open seats where 
there is no incumbent eleven are seats previously held by 
democrats and 18 were formerly gop seats 
one hotspot is maines first district where democrat joseph 
brennan is running to get back his old job as governor fighting 
for brennans house seat are democratic state sen tom andrews and 
republican david emery who is making a comeback bid 
also tough for democrats to defend is the cincinnati district of 
thomas luken who is retiring lukens son mayor charles luken is 
vying against ken blackwell a former cincinnati mayor and official 
of the department of housing and urban development blackwell is 
the gops best hope of electing a black republican to a house seat 
in five decades 
a slugfest has developed in the texas where democratic rep 
marvin leath is retiring state sen chet edwards a democrat is 
running to replace him against republican hugh shine a state house 
member shine has been attacking edwards for appearing at a 
fundraiser for a gay and lesbian group in houston last year 
democrats see their best hopes at picking open seats in 
arkansas where democratturnedrepublican tommy robinson left his 
seat to run for governor and in rhode island hawaii iowa and 
idaho where republican house members are running for senate seats

from mexico to chile millions of latin 
american indians descendants of warriors who fought the spanish 
conquerors five centuries ago are again rising against the white 
man 
the new fighting spirit was sparked by official plans to 
celebrate in 1992 the 500th year of the discovery of america by 
spain but the real goals are better living conditions and equal 
rights to land schools health care and jobs 
a survey by associated press correspondents shows the regions 
30 million indians are by far the poorest segment of latin 
americas 437 million residents 
various reports from un agencies governments and private 
groups had come to the same conclusion based on indians poor 
general living conditions generally inadequate housing lack of 
frequent access to utilities and even more limited access if any 
to education 
most nonindian latin americans view the discovery celebrations 
as a tribute to the merging of the european and indian culture and 
to the spanish legacy 
for the indians it is a sour reminder of what they see as 
bloody conquest and material and cultural spoliation 
the spanish conquerors transferred tons of gold and silver to 
spain from the newly discovered land especially from mexico and 
peru after dominating the natives in bloody wars 
the spanish conquest must be repudiated celebrating it would 
shameful and the justification of a massacre said manuel castro 
an indian leader in ecuador 
nearly everywhere in latin america indian organizations are 
protesting the plans for solemnly marking the centennial which 
includes a visit to the region in october by the spanish king and 
queen 
many are seeking elimination of columbus day oct 12 as a 
holiday they demand it be declared a day of indian dignity 
genaro dominguez leader of the regional coordinating agency of 
nndian peoples in mexico central america and the caribbean said 
that instead of marking oct 12 with a tribute to columbus indians 
in his region are paying homage to mexicos indian leader 
cuahutemoc 
but the new fight centers most on demands for progress on 
indians social and economic problems 
about 300 delegates from 120 indian groups gathered last july in 
quito ecuador and passed a resolution vowing to fight for 
autonomy saying the centennial opens a new stage in the struggle 
of our peoples 
indians in latin america seldom have access to their nations 
job market 
those who emigrate to the cities often end up getting low menial 
jobs though there have been reports of indian professional success 
stories recently in guatemala and most complain of what they call 
discrimination from the white man 
others remaining in wartorn countryside such as el salvador and 
peru live in shacks in reducciones small plots of generally 
poor land remnants of the sprawling territories their ancestors 
once owned most reducciones lack basic services such as 
electricity and running water 
besides urban emigration worsens racism and discrimination 
said marcelino cayuqueo an araucano indian leader in argentina 
in addition to facing widespread prejudices such as the 
belief that all indians are lazy dirty and drink too much said 
chilean mapuche indian leader jose ancan many of them develop what 
sociologists call the indian syndrome 
cayuqueo described the syndrome as an instinctive rejection by 
indians to accept their condition as such 
thats a common problem among mexicos 15 million indians 
nearly onefourth of the mexican population those who emigrate to 
the cities usually only get modest jobs such as domestic work or 
end up begging in the streets 
arturo warman an executive of mexicos institute of indian 
studies said there are about 5 million indians living under 
extreme poverty in that country illiteracy is rampant about 
350000 indians in honduras are reported plagued by poverty and 
disease living in hamlets in remote mountain areas 
meliton garcia a mexican indian leader said the proper way to 
mark the centennial would be by solving our problems 
indian leaders say the solution to their problems must begin 
with the recognition by the governments of their ethnic traditions 
cultures language and religions and the restoration of their 
land 
last month 800 bolivian indians walked through the jungle 
lowlands from amazonia to the mountain city of la paz to demand 
land from the government president jaime paz zamora promised to 
meet their demands 
in bolivia where indians or dominantly indian mixedrace people 
account for about 80 percent of a population of 69 million they 
complain of discrimination from the white minority 
most indian leaders complain they also lack legislation to 
protect them or if it exists it doesnt work 
the laws are good in theory but they are not implemented or 
simply there is no money said julio estrada secretary of the 
colombian national organization 
in ecuador indians account for 35 percent of the andean 
nations 10 million people last august they showed their strength 
by staging two uprisings for three days they seized a number 
of highways and farms to press the government for solutions to 
their problems 
indians angrily dispute the notion of discovery of their land by 
the spaniards saying you dont discover a land that is already 
populated 
they also reject the roman catholic church joining the 
celebrations to mark the evangelization on the new world 
they imposed their god on people who already had their god or 
gods said mapuche leader ancan 
added juan carlos ramirez executive director of costa ricas 
national commission of indian affairs the celebrations have been 
poorly conceived the notion of discovery is diminishing to indian 
peoples 
political groups especially from the left and some missionary 
organizations have gained influence over the indian movement 
the mexicobased council for the restoration of indian rights 
admitted that the combative opposition to the centennial 
celebrations has political connotations 
one of the most widespread and controversial indian demands is 
the restoration of part of their ancestors land they claim was 
illegally taken from them by force by white farmers 
we want restoration of our land now said numa mallorquiin 
an indian leader in paraguay 
indians also claim they will not be fully integrated to the 
societies in their country unless the governments officially 
implement bilingual education in the schools 
war is long gone but violence is often still part of life for 
indians including a handful of tribes still living in primitive 
isolation 
in brazil where conquerors came from portugal not spain the 
missionary indian council a catholic group promoting indian 
rights recently denounced what it called the genocide of the 
yanomani considered the worlds largest primitive tribe 
since 1987 the council said 1500 out of 9000 yanomanis in 
northern brazil have been killed by white men attracted by gold and 
diamond mines discovered on their land an offshoot of the 
yanomanis not known to exist was discovered this summer in southern 
venezuela

has chase manhattan bank become the trendsetter 
among banks when it comes to slashing dividends 
that question has had the industry abuzz ever since chase sliced 
its payout to shareholders in half little more than a week ago 
regionals midlantic corp and southeast banking corp shortly 
thereafter said that they would cut or eliminate their dividends 
followed by similar announcement from the bigger bank of boston 
were still in a very awkward phase here said merrill lynch 
amp co analyst judah kraushaar many banks are reluctant to 
compare themselves with chase 
still experts agree that chases move takes the edge off other 
institutions which now feel they can trim dividends without a 
major public relations disaster 
high dividend yields which have been approaching 20 percent of 
earnings for some big banks have helped lure investors and prop 
up the price of bank stocks for some time but it seems that 
support is weakening 
bank stock prices have gone into a tailspin among issues that 
touched lows for the past year are bank of new york bankers trust 
jp morgan manufacturers hanover ncnb corp and first chicago 
among others 
citicorp for example traded as high as 3550 a share in the 
past 52 weeks but has sunk to around 14 its 178 dividend 
represents nearly 8 percent of the current stock price 
many people got used to idea that bank dividends are 
sacrosanct but given the way stock prices are being pounded there 
is a growing expectation within the institutional community that 
banks simply cannot sustain these dividends one industry 
observer said 
chase said halving its regular dividend to 120 per common 
share on an annual basis was part of its move to reach higher 
levels of capital analysts have estimated the move could save 
chase as much as 150 million a year 
saddled with nonperforming debt to third world countries and 
bad domestic real estate loans banks ability to increase earnings 
has been severely curtailed 
among institutions viewed as particularly vulnerable are the 
bank of new york chemical bank citibank and first chicago 
kraushaar said because their core capital or owners equity has 
declined below 4 percent 
the federal deposit insurance corp plans to approve a rule by 
the end of the year that would allow only the strongest banks 
about one in five to maintain a minimum core capital level of 3 
percent others would be required to maintain minimums ranging 
between 4 percent and 5 percent 
cutting or eliminating dividends would give banks a quick fix 
since money not paid out to investors could be poured back into 
earnings coffers but longterm problems still plague the industry 
a weakening economy a real estate market expected to get worse 
before it improves and a decline in general business activity 
from mergers and acquisitions to businesses capital spending plans 
will deprive banks of old revenue sources for some time to come 
one thing that would prop up bank stocks would be a lot of 
excess capacity coming out of the banking industry kraushaar 
said or in other words mergers between large institutions 
they could try to cut out lots of redundancies and build 
earnings through cost cutting he said 
the trick for investors is to identify the institutions that 
will survive

republican hopes of slashing the democrats 
5545 senate majority hinge on the potential for a voter earthquake 
to shake things up in the final weeks before election day 
republicans so far have been unable to turn the electorate 
against a swath of democratic incumbents whom the gop identified 
earlier this year as potentially vulnerable 
all but one democratic incumbent is leading in the polls but 
democrats concede the republican claim that voters have been 
distracted by the crisis in the persian gulf and are just starting 
to focus on the races 
six weeks out and voters are only now paying attention 
said anita dunn spokeswoman for the democratic senatorial campaign 
committee i dont think any lead right now is very meaningful 
sen don nickles rokla chairman of the national republican 
senatorial committee recalled that in 1980 and 1986 the last two 
years where the senate changed parties the races really didnt 
close until the last three weeks 
the gop is certainly within striking distance in many races 
this year even if the polls dont always show it he said the 
list includes iowa michigan illinois hawaii nebraska montana 
and rhode island 
if republicans get most of the breaks which nickles says is 
unlikely they could pick up the five seats needed to wrest control 
from the democrats 
but the gop clearly would be satisfied with gaining just two or 
three seats which would make the democrats especially vulnerable 
in 1992 when many who barely won office in 1986 are up for 
reelection for the first time 
currently hawaii sen daniel akaka is the only incumbent 
democrat who is behind in the polls and not by much akaka was 
appointed to the senate earlier this year to fill the seat of the 
late spark matsunaga 
akaka is running against his former house colleague republican 
rep pat saiki 
iowa has been a brawl for months between democratic sen tom 
harkin and republican rep tom tauke republicans say tauke is 
whittling away at harkins lead but democrats say tauke was hurt 
by the disclosure that he accepted a congressional pay raise he had 
campaigned against tauke said he took the money but later donated 
it to charity 
the gops heavy recruitment of candidates from the house of 
representatives hasnt worked so well in other cases 
michigan illinois and rhode island are states where the 
democratic incumbents have held tenaciously to leads in polls 
despite tough opposition from gop house members 
in michigan incumbent democrat carl levin was preferred by 
voters 21 over rep bill schuette in a recent poll despite an 
aggressive television campaign by the republican challenger 
president bush interceded to get illinois rep lynn martin the 
gop nomination to challenge sen paul simon but the democrat has 
maintained a solid lead in the polls 
rhode island rep claudine schneider has proven statewide appeal 
in that tiny state but shes still struggling to chip away at the 
popularity of incumbent democratic sen claiborne pell 
earlier this year republicans considered sen max baucus 
dmont as the most vulnerable of their targets but baucus has 
climbed in the polls in recent weeks to a solid 25point lead over 
conservative lt gov allen kolstad 
while disappointed that more hasnt happened in those races the 
gop sees new opportunity in massachusetts where voters in the 
primary threw out the democratic party slate for state officers 
sen john kerry dmass has been indirectly hurt previously 
considered safe kerry suddenly is just barely ahead of challenger 
rappaport in the polls rappaport already has run a television ad 
linking kerry with unpopular gov michael dukakis 
but republicans may have trouble using the throw the rascals 
out tactic in many of the states where they have been most 
hopeful since they recruited so many sitting or former members of 
congress as candidates 
democrats are confident kerry will hold his seat just as 
republicans are confident jesse helms of north carolina will win 
even though hes in a dead heat in the polls with former charlotte 
mayor harvey gantt 
both sides point to longshot chances against the others 
incumbents in other states and democrats are behind but still hope 
to grab one or more of the three seats where republican incumbents 
are retiring in colorado idaho and new hampshire 
but perhaps the most unusual race of the year is one where both 
parties concede the outcome that sen j bennett johnston dla 
will win reelection 
the big question is whether johnston can capture 50 percent of 
the vote in louisianas oct 6 open primary and avoid a runoff in 
november with the sure secondplace finisher former ku klux 
klansman david duke 
republicans are so worried that duke will represent their party 
on the ticket that they have virtually abandoned the campaign of 
their chosen candidate ben bagert in hopes johnston can avoid a 
runoff

one reserve will be tapped and another bolstered 
as federal officials wrestle with two of the economys biggest 
enemies rising oil prices and a declining bank insurance fund 
within a span of 24 hours this past week president bush 
announced the sale of 5 release was designed to slow the increase in crude 
prices which have risen steadily since iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 
the fdic premium hike was aimed at shoring up the sagging banking 
business 
although the oil only amounts to a few drops from the total 590 
million barrels in reserve the release was significant for its 
symbolism bushs test sale signaled his willingness to tap the 
reserve to counter the effects of the persian gulf crisis 
germany japan and other nations also were considering dipping 
into their strategic reserves 
bush took some mild heat for the move because it was intended to 
dampen speculation in the oil markets not to fill a supply void 
the reserve was put in place following the oil shocks of the early 
1970s to counter oil shortages not high prices 
oil prices continued to advance in the futures market following 
the announcement but some analysts said regular reserve sales 
could help stabilize the market over the long term 
on the banking front the pressure for a decision on insurance 
premiums had been building for weeks as the health of the nations 
biggest banks deteriorated 
several major banks announced restructuring plans including job 
reductions and rare dividend cuts the rash of dividend cuts 
initiated by chase manhattan corp shocked the stock market which 
had grown accustomed to regular payouts from the big banks 
one government report showed losses from bank failures had 
whittled the insurance fund to 114 billion at the end of june 
down 14 percent from the end of last year l william seidman fdic 
chairman said he expected the insurance fund to lose 3 billion 
this year half again as much as previously estimated 
the increase in insurance premiums will force banks to pay 195 
cents for every 100 in deposits up from 12 cents this year if a 
bank passed the full increase on to customers somebody with 
10000 in a savings account would lose 750 in interest over a

deposed junkbond king michael milken returned to the headlines 
as the government and his defense lawyers prepared to play out the 
final chapter of his story in open court 
milken was due to be sentenced monday on the six felony counts 
to which he pleaded guilty in april but us district judge kimba 
wood put off the sentencing after being inundated with hundreds of 
pages of documents from both the prosecution and defense painting 
starkly different portraits of the financier 
prosecutors alleged a broad pattern of wrongdoing by milken well 
beyond the crimes he admitted and they urged the judge to impose a 
stiff prison sentence 
the defense refuted the additional allegations and described 
milken as a generous warm human being who should work with ghetto 
youth not go to jail 
the judge also received hundreds of letters from members of the 
public split along the same lines 
postponing the sentencing would allow time for a special hearing 
early in october to determine the real milken ivan boesky 
milkens chief accuser could be called to testify

the stock of entertainment giant mca inc shot up in response to 
a reported merger deal with matsushita electric industrial co 
trading around 34 before the news broke mca shares climbed to 
near 60 in anticipation of the offer which could bring between 
70 and 90 per share 
in addition to making mca stockholders rich the proposed 7 
billion acquisition would combine two top players in entertainment 
hardware and software 
the combination would mirror one established when sony corp 
bought columbia pictures entertainment for 5 billion last year 
while the idea revived concerns about japanese purchases of 
valuable us assets the deal looked good for both sides analysts 
said both needed to grow to compete against sony and time warner

theres more declining on wall street these days 
than just stock prices 
the number of shares changing has dwindled and analysts say the 
slowdown in momentum means the market probably has not hit bottom 
low volume unfortunately shows the sellers have not done their 
dastardly deed yet said alfred e goldman a vice president at 
st louisbased ag edwards amp sons inc he contends that because 
there are more sellers than buyers it takes more time to 
accommodate their desire to unload stocks and that keeps volume 
depressed 
volume on the big board averaged 17148 million shares a day 
this past week thats higher than the 14908 millionshare daily 
average the week before but still considered low 
most market observers would prefer to see that average in the 
200millionsharesaday range higher volume and increased 
volatility would be interpreted as a postive sign in a bear market 
the key to the stock market is not simply whether the dow jones 
industrial average moves up or down volume generally adds 
credibitity to market moves so a rally on high volume says more 
about investors confidence in stocks than a move up on light 
volume 
the weeks when daily big board trading volume averaged more than 
200 million shares a day have been few and far between this year 
up until august however the dow average usually rose when the 
pace of trading quickened for example the dow was up 63 points on 
the week in midmay when volume averaged 234 million shares a day 
but iraqs invasion of kuwait marked a turning point since then 
average daily volume has pretty much held below 200 million shares 
and when activity has neared that level the dow average has 
tumbled in some cases nearly 100 points on the week rathe than 
advance 
the invasion intensified two trajectories of the us economy 
that are negative for stocks said marc chandler an analyst at 
idea a consulting firm those are higher inflation from higher 
oil prices and an economic slowdown both of which cut 
corporate profitability and give investors excuses for losing 
confidence in stocks 
the quiet in the market as evidenced by low volume suggests 
that investors both big and small ones have become afraid 
because the risks of investing now in particular stocks are much 
higher said hugh johnson senior vice president at first albany 
corp theres more uncertainty today than any time i can recall 
in the past 10 years 
the dow jones average closed friday at 245248 down 5990 on 
the week and off 42821 points for the third quarter 
the bestperforming industry groups in the quarter were oil 
drilling which advanced nearly 10 percent integrated major oil 
companies oil equipment and services and precious metals 
according to dow jones amp co industry groups that took the biggest 
hit were lodging home constructionand casinos each down more than 
40 percent 
the new york stock exchange composite index settled at 16785 
down 318 on the week the nasdaq composite index for the 
overthecounter market dropped 2774 to 33451 and the american

uncertainty about the middle east and discouraged 
individual investors sent stock prices plunging to the lowest point 
in 3 years in tokyo today the dollar closed higher against the 
japanese yen 
the closely watched 225issue nikkei stock average shed 78841 
points or 362 percent to finish at 2098350 estimated volume 
on the exchanges first section was 450 million shares 
it was the lowest close since march 3 1987 when the closely 
watched average ended the day at 2097139 points fridays finish 
was also lower than the october 1987 black monday drop to 
2191008 
on thursday the index lost 47871 points or 215 percent 
closing at 2177191 
analysts blamed fears of war in the middle east high interest 
rates and climbing oil prices for sidelining institutional 
investors 
benchmark brent crude prices broke the general upward trend 
today by falling slightly in asia 
brent crude for november delivery was valued at about 3915 to 
3925 a barrel or about 10 to 15 cents below levels seen late 
thursday in new york 
the stock markets own downward momentum in addition to higher 
interest rates has lured institutional money to other investment 
vehicles with higher returns analysts said 
institutional investors are taking a safety first approach 
said peter tasker a strategist for kleinwort benson international 
the sharp drop since wednesday however resulted largely from 
individual investors liquidating big portions of their holdings to 
meet margin calls from brokers brokers said 
the market has dropped by close to half since its alltime high 
of 3891587 points at the end of last year 
it is a really serious condition we have not seen as serious 
a condition in japanese history said akira yasui head of 
research for county natwest securities japan 
the reverse asset effect that we have now will change the 
japanese economy he said capital expenditures by small and 
mediumsized industries for instance could drop in the next 
quarter because a bearish stock market and high interest rates 
would make raising money difficult 
individual investors whose stock profits propelled them into a 
frenzy of consumption in the last couple of years will feel the 
pinch 
normal consumption will be fairly firm but the wealth that 
was created by the rise in equities and land prices is going to 
disappear tasker said 
analysts said the market probably will continue to decline 
particularly if a war breaks out in the persian gulf region but no 
one knows how far it will fall several mentioned a striking lack 
of panic in general despite a selloff that hit the market in the 
afternoon on a rumor quickly denied of bombings in iraq 
fears about the middle east have benefited the dollar dealers 
said 
the dollar finished at 13795 yen up 045 yen from thursdays 
13750yen close the currency opened at 13833 and trading ranged 
between 13765 yen and 13838 yen 
unless there is a war the dollar will move in the 135138 yen 
range for a while although some dealers think the currency is 
still generally heading down said masato hayashi chief customer 
dealer for the bank of tokyo 
the stock markets steep slide also has weakened the yen but 
activity on the currency markets should pick up on monday the 
start of the fiscal years second half he said 
in bond dealings the yield of the benchmark no119 10year 
japanese government bonds rose to 8690 percent by 3 pm 2 am 
edt from thursdays 8680percent close their price was lower at 
8073 points from 8079

a union representing about 1200 san 
francisco newspaper workers unanimously authorized a strike if 
contract talks fail to forge an agreement soon 
weve been bargaining since last february and our members are 
increasingly upset that no contract has been reached yet said 
bernie beck of the northern california newspaper guilds unit at 
the san francisco chronicle 
local guild president steven r michael said after thursdays 
strike authorization vote that he hoped a strike wouldnt be 
necessary no deadline for completion of contract talks had been 
set he said 
the guild represents reporters and certain other employees at 
the chronicle examiner and the newspaper agency the jointly owned 
company that prints and distributes both papers 
they have worked without a contract since feb 2 the current 
contract contains an evergreen clause which means it remains 
in force until a new agreement is reached beck said 
he said that publishers still are at some distance about work 
rules and that negotiations about things such as wages and hours 
havent even begun 
in all about 4500 employees represented by the 10 unions are 
working without contracts at the two papers and newspaper agency 
the conference of newspaper unions will represent all 10 unions in

about 7500 people who inspect beef pork 
chicken soup and aunt lindas favorite brand of liver sausage will 
forfeit a big hunk of their october paychecks if no federal 
spending deal is worked out 
moreover if the mandatory cutbacks are put in place monday as 
scheduled without a new budget agreement that special brand of 
liver sausage made by a tiny momandpop operation back in the 
hills may vanish entirely 
thats because no one is allowed to sell meat and poultry 
products unless it is checked by federal inspectors and the 
inspectors are going to take unpaid holidays furloughs next 
month 
department of agriculture officials say they do not expect 
severe shortages at food stores but they acknowledge that some 
specialty items from small processors could be hit hard 
final notices to the nations 7000 federally inspected plants 
were sent out thursday by lester m crawford head of the 
departments food safety and inspection service or fsis 
when the furlough becomes effective the meat and poultry 
industry may not engage in any activities that require 
inspection crawford told plant owners 
effectively this will halt production of meat and poultry on 
those days specified by crawford as his agencys furlough period 
and the fourday layoff will continue each twoweek pay cycle 
perhaps until 140 days of furlough time has been logged 
bill hudnall the agencys deputy administrator for 
adminstrative management said about 5900 federal inspectors check 
on the nations supply of meat and poultry along with 1300 
veterinarians and 300 food technologists 
they make pp the inspection force of fsis about 82 percent of 
the agencys work force most of the fsis budget goes for salaries 
total spending by fsis was projected at about 4409 million in 
the 1991 fiscal year that begins monday a mandatory cutback under 
the grammrudman budgetbalancing law would lop off 1433 million 
the 324 percent acrosstheboard cuts in federal spending 
collectively called a sequester of funds would require layoffs of 
fsis employees beginning oct 9 10 11 and 12 
much of the record 377 billion pounds of beef that will be 
turned out by plants next year will be produced from cattle 
slaughtered in colorado kansas nebraska and texas 
huge poultry plants operate in arkansas georgia maryland 
north carolina and other states where broilers and turkeys are 
produced a record 337 billion pounds of poultry are expected next 
year 
we have some plants that operate two or three shifts a day 
and they would have maybe 20 inspectors per shift hudnall said 
in an interview we could have a single plant counting all the 
shifts with 45 or 50 even 60 fsis employees but that would be 
unusual 
we probably have 3000 of our inspectors in 200 plants 
hudnall said that means the other 4500 people are spread among 
the other 6500 to 6700 plants 
most of these are processing plants that use meat and poultry to 
make soup stew sausage and other items 
federal law dating back to the early years of the century 
requires fulltime continuous inspection at all slaughtering 
operations processing however is not required to be under 
constant federal inspection 
a lot of these are very very small hudnall said they 
are one two or three people that produce a regional sausage or 
ethnic food and theyre scattered all over the place 
there have been moneysaving sequesters before but each time 
congress has provided supplemental appropriations to keep the 
inspection services operating but the one scheduled for october is 
the biggest yet 
if the layoffs are enforced to the hilt hudnall said they would 
idle plants for over half the year 
the hardship on federal inspectors would be obvious slaughter 
inspectors are paid 20195 to 26252 per year he said 
processing inspectors earn in the range of 24705 to 32121 many 
earn overtime too which is mainly paid for by the meat companies

the office of fair trading on friday cleared five 
oil companies of fixing gasoline pump prices in the face of rising 
crude oil prices that followed the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
the offices director general gordon borrie said the 
industrys reaction to events in the persian gulf followed a 
pattern one would expect in a competitive market 
the office launched its inquiry aug 24 and asked for 
information of price increases from the five major oil companies 
operating in britain british petroleum co plc royal dutch shell 
group of cos texaco inc mobil corp and exxon corp 
excess profits didnt appear to be generated at retail 
wholesale or refining stages of the industry borrie said 
he noted that increased demand since the aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait had generated windfall profits at the production stage 
but he said it was a question of public policy not competition 
policy whether moves should be made to moderate price rises or 
redistribute windfalls

municipal bond investors afraid financial 
troubles like philadelphias may crop up elsewhere are beginning to 
demand higher returns for their risk 
but some analysts say the yields have to get higher to make it 
worth investing in municipalities that face severe budget deficits 
particularly those in the slumping northeast 
for cities and states already strapped higher yields raise the 
cost of borrowing money 
massachusetts on thursday had to offer yields as high as 797 
percent for a 13 billion package of revenue bonds that was about 
15 percentage points higher than a maryland offering earlier in 
the week 
the massachusetts bonds were rated bbb by standard amp poors 
corp while the maryland issue got the highest aaa rating 
massachusetts is running a budget deficit only two months into its 
fiscal year 
the socalled quality spread which compares yields of 
lowerrated municipal bonds to the highest rated has been very 
narrow recently but is begining to widen analysts say 
yields on 30year arated revenue bonds are running 45 to 55 
hundredths of a percentage point higher than the yields for 
aaarated general obligation bonds according to municipal market 
data inc the quality spreads are narrower for shorterterm issues 
investors concerns are legitimate in that quality spreads are 
still so narrow that theyre not getting paid for their credit 
risk said george friedlander municipal market analyst at smith 
barney upham amp co 
philadelphias inability to sell about 375 million in 
shortterm notes and officials predictions that the city will run 
out of cash around dec 1 have prompted municipal bond investors 
to begin focusing on credit quality 
while the market continues to be driven by developments in the 
middle east concern has been growing since early summer over how 
budget deficits and recession which cuts into tax revenues would 
affect the ability of cities and states to make debt payments 
we have been concerned about the trend in a lot of state and 
local governments asked to bear a larger share of entitlements and 
other programs required by the federal government while at same 
time revenue counted on to pay for the programs is not there 
said neal atterman municipal research director at kidder peabody 
amp co 
the stock price of mbia a major municipal bond insurer has 
been particularly hard hit by the worries over credit quality the 
stock last week sunk to around 25 from about 37 the week before 
many investors feel mbia is heavily exposed to philadelphias 
debt and could suffer if philadelphia defaults however the 
company said exposure to philadelphia debt is not excessive and 
standard amp poors affirmed mbias aaa rating 
standard amp poors and moodys investors service inc have 
lowered their ratings on philadelphias general obligation bonds 
which are backed by the citys faith and credit sampp ranks the 
bonds at ccc and moodys puts them at b giving the debt junkbond 
status 
general obligation bonds are usually viewed as more secure than 
revenue bonds which depend on user fees such as bridge tolls to 
make payments 
however some are beginning to look at selected revenue bonds as 
more recessionproof since it has been philadelphias general 
obligation bonds that are considered to be the larger credit risk 
weve been of the philosophy that some are better off with a 
set revenue stream people are still going to pay tolls in a 
recession said nicole anderes head of municipal research at new 
yorkbased roosevelt amp cross inc an investment firm that focuses 
on northeast municipalities 
some see the chances of pennsylvania allowing its largest city 
to default as slim and point out that investors who held on to 
their bonds during the fiscal crises in new york and cleveland 
during the 1970s survived intact 
for the investor who could survive a long period of illiquidity 
it might be worth the risk some say 
steven j hueglin executive vice president at gabriele hueglin 
amp cashman inc says philadelphias bonds are a good speculative 
investment particularly the general obigation issue

soybean and wheat futures opened slightly higher 
today on the chicago board of trade corn was unchanged 
early support for soybeans followed yesterdays late release of 
the agriculture departments quarterly report on the estimated 
stockpile of grains in the united states 
the report found a slightly lower than expected number of 
soybeans in this years harvest forecasts of rain in the midwest 
this weekend where soybeans are grown also helped drive prices 
up 
wheat prices rose slightly also on the usda report of an 
unexpectedly small harvest in that grain speculation that the 
soviet union will eventually buy some wheat flour under a 
subsidized program also drove prices higher 
corn was unchanged as nearly ideal weather conditions for 
harvest remained in the region 
nervousness about early trading on the new york stock market 
later eroded much of the opening support for wheat soybeans and 
corn 
in early trading wheat futures were 1 to 2 cents lower with 
contracts for delivery in december at 276 a bushel corn was 1 
cent lower to cent higher with december at 228 a bushel oats

workforce today and blamed rising fuel costs as the cause 
chicagobased midway also said it would end service to savannah 
ga on nov 1 and reduce its service to 11 other cities beginning 
oct 15 
these actions are necessitated by escalating fuel costs 
brought on by the persian gulf crisis midway chairman david 
hinson said in a statement 
midway as well as other airlines is actively addressing the 
need to adjust system flying in order to reduce operating costs and 
produce a better balance between capacity and passenger demand 
hinson said 
the reduction will affect 10 percent of midways work force 
said spokeswoman sandra allen 
she said most of the 500 positions will be eliminated through 
layoffs that will be phased in through nov 1 some jobs will be 
eliminated by not filling positions vacated during the past several 
weeks allen said 
she said all departments in the company will be affected but 
declined to release specific numbers 
hinson said midway also plans to withdraw eight of its least 
fuel efficient aircraft from its fleet and replace them with more 
efficient md80 jetliners made by mcdonnell douglas corp

plans to rescue two united mine workers health 
care funds now staggering under an 88 million deficit are 
stirring anxiety among nonunion coal operators 
the operators fear a new industrywide coal tax will be proposed 
to bail out the troubled 1950 and 1974 umw health benefit trusts 
which serve 127052 retired union miners widows and dependents 
thats the big buzzword this week in the industry a growing 
feeling that nonunion companies may have to pay something 
said marc cohen coal analyst for kidder peabody amp co in new york 
in march us labor secretary elizabeth dole appointed an 
11member commission to study the trusts the panel which has no 
lawmaking power will release its recommendations at two meetings 
scheduled for oct 11 and oct 17 in washington 
henry perritt vice chairman of the commission said thursday 
theres been no decision on financing the trusts rescue but 
indicated some type of industrywide financing is being considered 
there is fairly strong evidence that the problem of health 
care obligation for retirees cant be solved in the long run 
without some kind of broadening of the financing obligations 
said perritt 
the panel also is looking at ways to improve the delivery of 
health care services to retirees said perritt 
my hope is well be able to put together a whole package to 
address the financing side and address the care delivery side that 
takes advantage of the thinking thats being expressed in the 
national dialogue on health care policy said perritt 
the panel will hold the last in a series of public hearings oct 
10 in washington where the coal tax issue is expected to dominate 
discussions 
mrs dole formed the commission on the heels of the umws 
10month strike against the pittston co the strike was triggered 
in part when the company stopped paying into the funds pittston 
said the payments hurt its competitiveness in the export market 
pittston settled with the union and contributed a 10 million 
lumpsum payment into the 1950 health fund 
the 1950 and 1974 funds are financed by coal companies that sign 
the national umw labor agreement known as the bituminous coal 
operators association contract 
but there are fewer bcoa companies to uupport the health plan 
than needed to keep it in the black about half of the industrys 
work force are union members 
now the 1950 fund faces a 73 million deficit while the 1974 
fund is 15 million in debt 
other problems include the high cost of health care and a 
federal lawsuit alleging mismanagement of the fund the funds are 
separate from the union and are operated by independent trustees 
the funds dilemma has delayed payments for health care services 
in the coalfields retirees and their families have problems 
finding drugstores that accept the umwa health plan card 
earlier this month eight nonunion coal companies protested the 
rumored bailout plan in a letter to labor secretary dole 
it would be an unprecedented projection of federal power into 
labor management relations in this country to require unionfree 
companies to pay for benefits available only to union members 
the letter said it was signed by officials for quaker coal co 
shell mining co mapco coal co addington resources coastal 
energy co arco coal co kerrmcgee coal corp and santa fe 
pacific coal corp 
forcing noninvolved companies to pick up the bill for 
parties failure to confront their economic problems in collective 
bargaining would establish an inappropriate and potentially 
catastrophic public policy the letter said 
one probable solution is transferring money from the unions fat 
pension fund to bail out the health trust last year the 1950 and 
1974 pension trusts showed 517 billion in assets after 
subtracting liabilities according to umw documents 
last year sen jay rockefeller dwva introduced a bill 
allowing transfer of money from the overfunded pension trusts to 
the ailing health care trusts the bill also would have required 
nonunion companies pay into the benefit trusts 
rockefellers bill has been placed on hold pending the 
commissions report provisions of the rockefeller bill including 
the pension fund transfer have been looked on favorably by the 
commission said two sources familiar with the study who requested 
anonymity

martin shugrue was telling a campus audience the 
other day that his 100 days campaign at eastern was a victory 
what victory shouted one of the striking eastern machinists 
union members who joined students for shugrues speech at florida 
international university 
survival dear friend survival was shugrues answer 
but even that minimal accomplishment is in doubt as an airline 
industry downturn steepened by soaring oil prices worsens 
easterns viability 
its worse because everybodys worse said robert joedicke 
airline analyst for shearson lehman brothers inc theres no way 
you can make up the immediate rise in fuel prices 
jet fuel prices have soared since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
driving up the cost of oil the major airlines have increased fares 
some of them twice but with passenger traffic already sluggish 
they cant raise them to match the higher fuel costs 
for eastern things are even worse like most carriers 
theyre between the rock and the hard place joedicke said not 
only that the airline was already in a financial bind thats a 
hard thing to carry on 
eastern filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 1 years ago 
and has seen operating losses continue at more than 2 million a 
day its secondquarter operating loss was 2344 million and 
shugrue has indicated thirdquarter results wont be comforting for 
increasingly nervous creditors 
shugrue this week expressed frustration about the impact of the 
persian gulf crisis which has increased easterns fuel costs from 
56 cents a gallon to 96 cents it came he said as the airline was 
making progress 
in august its load capacity was 72 percent eastern was showing 
its strongest signs of progress since it began rebuilding from the 
crippling march 4 1989 strike led by machinists and joined by 
pilots and flight attendants after years of labormanagement 
tension 
the company also recently announced a major push to draw 
business travelers by offering special rates expanded firstclass 
cabins and amenities like airphones for every seat to a better 
wine list eastern also unveiled special flights to winter vacation 
destinations for frequent fliers 
while industry analysts saw the efforts as good longterm 
strategy doubts have risen about whether eastern has a long term 
shugrue said eastern would need to fly at 102 percent capacity 
to break even at current fuel prices he asked for presidential 
intervention such as president bushs announcement this week to 
draw on the countrys strategic petroleum reserve of crude oil 
a former pilot and veteran airline executive shugrue says hes 
against industry reregulation or government involvement in 
corporate affairs 
but he added forces outside our control must be managed by a 
higher authority 
someone has to evaluate the present situation and develop some 
guidelines to stanch the flow of corporate blood restore 
jobs shugrue said 
this could be the script sometime in the foreseesable future 
in early 199 maybe us air traffic shared by only four carriers 
all other airlines have fallen to the wayside he said 
shugrue argued that the megacarrier scenario has serious 
national implications the giant carriers would focus their quest 
for riches abroad he said and fares for us consumers would 
skyrocket while travel choices decreased 
meanwhile industrywide problems may reduce easterns 
alternatives a longdiscussed merger with continental seems 
unlikely analysts say and while eastern and northwest airlines 
have been talking the tightening market probably would make it 
difficult for northwest to afford a takeover 
eastern is dependent upon bankruptcy judge burton liflands 
willingness to allow continued draws on an escrow account to keep 
it operating on thursday he authorized the release of 50 
million 
the judge has made clear he wants to make sure eastern has had 
every chance to stay alive and preserve the jobs of 17000 
employees 
analysts expect the judge to give easterns corporate fare 
strategy which begins monday time to work 
the judge wants to give eastern as much time as possible 
said ray neidl of dillon read amp co so even if the unsecured 
creditors step up their lobbying for liquidation if eastern can 
show some progress that can be diffused but the clock is 
ticking

house speaker thomas foley said today that 
although congressional and white house bargainers are near a 500 
billion budget deal disputes remain that leave widescale slashes 
in federal programs looming for monday 
there are some remaining issues that are very difficult that 
remain to be resolved said foley dwash 
negotiators still divided over whether to impose new taxes on 
the wealthy and other issues planned to meet through the weekend 
if necessary in hopes of agreeing to a package congress planned a 
rare sunday session to deal with the fiscal crisis 
more than four months of talks have brought tentative agreements 
to cut defense and domestic programs and raise the governments 
take on items ranging from gasoline to medicare premiums officials 
familiar with the talks said thursday 
but at nearly 130 am today negotiators broke for the evening 
saying they could not yet shake hands on a pact 
so close and yet were not quite there said house minority 
leader robert michel rill as he and other bargainers ended 
their backroom meeting in the capitol 
the major question remained whether democrats would finally 
agree to a reduction in the capital gains tax a longtime demand 
of president bush and which levies on the wealthy would be 
boosted to compensate 
were still working on all of that said house budget 
committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
without a budget deal federal drug agents food and drug 
inspectors and many of the governments 21 million civilian 
workers faced furloughs beginning monday 
the lack of an agreement would trigger 85 billion in spending 
cuts social security soldiers salaries and many initiatives for 
the poor are exempted but most federal programs faced immediate 
budget slashes of about onethird 
at the talks republicans were willing to abandon the 
presidents insistence to lower the rates of the capital gains tax 
which is charged against the profits of property sales officials 
said 
instead they were willing to leave current rates alone and 
exempt from the levy increases in the value of an asset due to 
inflation 
but insistent that most benefits of the tax cut would go to the 
wealthy democrats were holding out for a counterbalancing tax 
increase on the welltodo 
several options were under consideration including raising tax 
rates on the richest americans and limiting their deductions 
a rate increase would represent a significant political victory 
for democrats over bush whose 1988 campaign is best remembered for 
his chant of no new taxes 
the two sides have tentatively agreed to hold defense spending 
to 170 billion below the amount it would need to stay even with 
inflation over the next five years including a 10 billion cut 
next year 
the growth of benefit programs would be slowed by 120 billion 
half of it coming from medicare 
participants in the program which provides health care to 33 
million elderly and disabled people would bear half the cuts much 
of the savings would come from a 570 increase in the 2860 
payment they make monthly for doctors coverage doctors and 
hospitals would have to swallow the other half of the medicare 
reductions 
over five years support payments to farmers would be cut 12 
billion and benefits for civil servants would drop by 14 billion 
although not yet agreed to it appeared likely that social 
security recipients would be hit for 20 billion in savings either 
by having costofliving increases delayed or the taxes on their 
benefits increased 
tax increases tentatively set were an 8centpergallon increase 
in the federal gasoline levy already at 9 cents a separate tax on 
all fuels based on their energy content and a 10 percent tax on 
luxury items including yachts furs and jewelry 
democrats would like to boost the income tax rate on the 
wealthiest americans above its current 28 percent people who fall 
just below the top bracket must pay taxes of 33 percent and 
democrats would like to increase the top rate to at least 31 
percent officials said 
as an alternative they are considering a plan limiting the 
deductions people who earn above 100000 can claim to 90 or 95 
percent of what they would otherwise be entitled 
democrats also have proposed lifting the earnings ceiling above 
which medicare taxes are not taken out of paychecks 
as part of social security withholding people now pay a 145 
percent tax to support medicare on earnings up to 51300 per year 
they pay nothing on money they earn above that amount under the 
proposal that ceiling would be lifted to 65000 or 75000

a stock market reform bill expanding the 
securities and exchange commissions powers to monitor major wall 
street players and intervene during stock market emergencies was 
passed unanimously by the house on friday 
the bill was approved on a voice vote 
house passage of the market reform act of 1990 which the senate 
approved on tuesday sends the bill to the white house for 
president bushs signature 
the bill was agreed upon after a month of discussions between 
house and senate staffers it will allow the sec to regulate 
program trading the controversial computerdriven trading 
strategy during times of extreme market turbulence 
in addition the compromise market reform bill contains 
provisions passed separately by both the house and senate earlier 
this year 
one expands the authority of the sec chairman to shut down the 
securities markets with presidential permission in times of 
market emergency previously only the president could order a 
trading halt 
other provisions 
require large securities traders to report their market 
positions to the sec 
mandate coordinated clearance and settlement of stocks 
options and futures contracts between the sec and the commodity 
futures trading commission 
require the treasury department federal reserve board the 
cftc and sec to report annually to congress on their efforts to 
protect the integrity of the markets 
give the sec authority to assess the financial health of the 
parent holding companies of brokerdealers 
drexel burnham lambert inc the onetime junk bond giant of 
wall street collapsed in february after the failure of its parent 
holding company which sec officials have complained they had no 
authority to monitor 
the original house version the securities markets reform act 
passed in june contained a provision giving the sec authority to 
limit program trading during periods of extraordinary market 
volatility the sharp climbs or drops in stock prices 
the original senate version the market reform act which passed 
last month did not have a program trading provision 
critics of program trading the rapidfire transactions through 
computerized buy and sell programs of enormous blocks of stocks 
blame it for worsening the 1987 stock market crash and the 
190point market drop last oct 13 
they are especially critical of one form of program trading 
index arbitrage in which speculators try to take advantage of 
small brief price differences between the stock and futures 
markets by simultaneously buying large orders in one market while 
selling in the other 
the version passed by the senate narrowed slightly the scope of 
the secs authority it gives the sec rulemaking authority to 
prohibit during times of extraordinary market volatility any 
trading practice in securities that the agency previously has 
found contributed significantly to the threat to orderly 
markets or is reasonably certain to do so

close of thin quiet trading friday on the chicago board of trade 
soybeans opened with early support following yesterdays 
afterclosing release of the agriculture departments quarterly

armstrong an analyst for agrivisor services inc in bloomington 
the usda report obviously wasnt enough to bring any new 
buying and there wasnt any bad news to bring a lot of selling 
armstrong said 
wheat futures also opened slightly higher but fell on 
professional selling and continued questions about whether the 
soviet union will accept a government offer to buy subsidized wheat 
flour 
corn suffered from minimal nearterm export demand and the 
approach of active harvesting 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cents lower to cent higher

and advanced today as investors were lured by bargainbasement

in the banking sector where stocks had been hammered for days the 
broader market however remained mixed 
the session began on a sour note the dow jones industrial 
average plunged nearly 50 points piercing the 2400level shortly 
after the opening bell as many big japanese investors sold stocks 
with prices falling sharply overnight in tokyo and with the first 
half of japans fiscal year drr every 100 in deposits up from 12 cents 
this year if a 
bank passed the full increase on to customers somebody with

the dow jones industrial average below the 2500 mark to levels not 
seen since may 1989 the dows 12 percent erosion since the first

deposed junkbond king michael milken returned to the headlines 
as the government and his defense lawyers prepared to play out the 
final chapter of his story in open court 
milken was due to be sentenced monday on the six felony counts 
to which he pleaded guilty in april but us district judge kimba 
wood put off the sentencing after being inundated with hundreds of 
pages of documents from both the prosecution and defense painting 
starkly different portraits of the financier 
prosecutors alleged a broad pattern of wrongdoing by milken well 
beyond the crimes he admitted and they urged the judge to impose a 
stiff prison sentence 
the defense refuted the additional allegations and described 
milken as a generous warm human being who should work with ghetto 
youth not go to jail 
the judge also received hundreds of letters from members of the 
public split along the same lines 
postponing the sentencing would allow time for a special hearing 
early in october to determine the real milken ivan boesky 
milkens chief accuser could be called to testify

the stock of entertainment giant mca inc shot up in response to 
a reported merger deal with matsushita electric industrial co 
trading around 34 before the news broke mca shares climbed to 
near 60 in anticipation of the offer which could bring between 
70 and 90 per share 
in addition to making mca stockholders rich the proposed 7 
billion acquisition would combine two top players in entertainment 
hardware and software 
the combination would mirror one established when sony corp 
bought columbia pictures entertainment for 5 billion last year 
while the idea revived concerns about japanese purchases of 
valuable us assets the deal looked good for both sides analysts 
said both needed to grow to compete against sony and time warner 
inc two of the biggest competitors in the field

president mikhail s gorbachev struggling to 
maintain central control over soviet political and economic life 
plans to transform 550 armament factories to civilian production 
his spokesman said friday 
gorbachev and top aides met to complete the conversion plan as 
representatives of seven soviet republics agreed to bypass central 
authorities in working out a new system of economic and political 
cooperation 
the supreme soviet parliament has been unable to pass a cohesive 
reform plan and on monday granted gorbachev extraordinary powers 
to transform the national economy from a planned to a market 
system 
representatives of nine of the 15 soviet republics and the mayor 
of leningrad dissatisfied with gorbachevs reforms met in the 
estonian capital of tallinn and signed a protocol establishing an 
economic consultative committee to coordinate their own shift to a 
market economy 
gorbachevs plan to shift hundreds of defense plants to civilian 
production appeared designed to quell fears of a military 
resurgence and to assure people the central government was acting 
to meet consumer demands 
presidential spokesman vitaly n ignatenko told reporters that 
gorbachev was meeting late friday with members of the advisory 
presidential council to cement plans to shift arms plants to the 
production of processed food medicine electronics and other goods 
desperately needed in the faltering soviet economy 
the 550 factories would be converted in stages over the next 
five years to produce 270 billion rubles 4725 billion worth of 
goods for civilian use from 1990 through 1995 twice the level as 
during the previous fiveyear period ignatenko told a briefing 
on thursday gorbachev issued his first decree under the 
enhanced powers threatening businesses with fines if they did not 
fulfill supply contracts to government retailers 
ignatenko denied that ordering businesses to meet the contracts 
contradicted gorbachevs stated intent of transforming the nation 
the measures ignatenko said are designed to stabilize the 
situation and move to a market economy as soon as possible they do 
not mean that mr gorbachev has rejected his own ideas 
gorbachev meeting in the kremlin with the chairman of the 
general electric corp jack welch acknowledged that the soviet 
union is living through a dramatic tough but creative time 
the soviet people understand the need to radicalize the 
economic reform revitalize finances change the forms and types of 
property ownership and move to market mechanisms the state news 
agency tass quoted gorbachev as telling welch 
representatives of nine soviet republics met in tallinn to find 
a way to speed the reforms all but two soviet republics including 
the russian federation have declared some form of sovereignty from 
central authorities since march and the protocol affirmed the 
right of the republics to chart their own political and economic 
course 
but the protocol echoed one aspect of the decree gorbachev 
issued thursday directing republics to maintain existing 
economic ties for he period of transition to the market 
signing the protocol were officials from russia the largest and 
wealthiest republic the three baltic republics of lithuania 
latvia and estonia as well as armenia kirghizia and moldavia 
the estonian news agency reported 
leningrad mayor anatoly sobchak also attended the reports said 
leningrad is the second largest soviet city representatives from 
tadzhikistan and byelorussia attended the session but did not sign 
the protocol it said 
the three baltic republics have said they will not sign the new 
union treaty that gorbachev is preparing to unite the republics 
into a loose confederation 
the protocol signed friday expressed support for efforts by the 
republics to negotiate bilateral economic political and cultural 
treaties bypassing the central government

the mexican governments foreign debt has 
increased because of the persian gulf crisis nearly wiping out any 
additional revenue from increased crude oil exports the newspaper 
el financiero reported friday 
treasury department documents say the debt shot up by 11 
billion to 756 billion since aug 2 mostly because of the drop 
of the us dollar against the japanese yen and western european 
currencies 
the bulk of mexicos foreign trade and debt is carried out in 
us dollars while an estimated 215 percent is in nondollar 
currencies the newspaper said 
service on the debt will increase by 101 million this year 
because of rising interest rates el financiero said 
mexico increased its crude oil exports by 100000 barrels a day 
to 1325 million barrels to help make up for the shortage caused by

the dollar gained against all major currencies 
except its canadian counterpart in unusually slow us trading 
friday after moving mostly lower overseas 
gold prices posted minor losses and gains in world trading 
the dollar traded within a narrow band on domestic and foreign 
markets 
the typically light volume that ordinarily occurs on fridays was 
curtailed even further by the approaching end to the month 
calendar year quarter and half of japans fiscal year all three 
occur sunday 
the start of the jewish yom kippur holiday which began at 
sundown friday also lightened liquidity because some dealers left 
work early 
traders were reluctant to stake out significant new positions 
and institutional currency investors were finishing up seasonal 
paperwork 
what buying there was in the dollar reflected traders hedging 
against a possible escalation in the middle east conflict over the 
weekend the dollar is traditionally considered a safe investment 
haven at times of international turmoil 
financial markets regarded the latest us economic reading 
merely as confirmation of what has been widely known for some time 
the commerce department report on the governments chief economic 
forecasting gauge had virtually no lasting impact on the dollar 
the index of leading indicators tumbled 12 percent in august 
its steepest fall in three years it was viewed as another signal 
of a possible recession ahead for the united states 
the dollar firmed against the japanese yen in tokyo where 
another selloff on the stock market chipped away confidence in the 
countrys currency 
the dollar rose 045 yen to a closing 13795 yen in the japanese 
capital later in london it was quoted at 13815 yen and at 13850 
yen late in new york up from 13798 yen late thursday

after nearly four years of government and public 
scrutiny a shattered career and a humiliating guilty plea in wall 
streets worst scandal michael milken thought he had neared 
judgment day 
but milkens legal rite of reckoning in a manhattan federal 
courtroom on monday was postponed for reasons that could be either 
ominous or fortunate for the 44yearold prince of junkbond 
financing 
us district judge kimba m wood decided late last week to 
delay sentencing and hold an extraordinary hearing into numerous 
allegations of criminal conduct by milken that extend far beyond 
his six admitted felonies of conspiracy securities fraud mail 
fraud and aiding and abetting tax fraud 
she said the hearing likely to take place in midoctober would 
help her better understand whether milkens crimes were aberrant as 
the defense has claimed or systematic as alleged by the government 
wood is relatively new to the bench but widely acclaimed for 
careful handling of her first nationally prominent criminal 
sentencing faced with mountains of documents from both sides of 
the case painting widely divergent pictures of the accused she 
chose to solicit more information 
the hearing she has proposed presents formidable new hurdles for 
each side the government will have to lay out its evidence that 
milken was not only a crook but an unrepentant one milkens 
lawyers will be put in the uncomfortable position of deflecting 
those punches in a public forum which is something they had hoped 
to avoid 
the purpose is not to establish whether a defendant is guilty 
of every unadmitted defense that is precisely the opportunity the 
government chooses to forego when it accepts a guilty plea to fewer 
than all of the alleged crimes wood told the lawyers for both 
sides at a presentence hearing 
rather the purpose of considering unadmitted conduct is to 
give the court a sense of the defendants character as it is 
reflected in his conduct woods decision seemed to catch the 
prosecution and defense by surprise as it tossed them into vaguely 
charted legal waters it also left unresolved the final chapter of 
the tortuous milken story which began after ivan boesky pleaded 
guilty to securities fraud in november 1986 and put the government 
on the trail of the drexel burnham lambert junkbond wizard 
some lawyers even suggested the hearing raised the remote 
possibility that milken who tearfully pleaded guilty to the six 
counts in april after insisting he was innocent of any wrongdoing 
would scrap that deal and gamble anew on a fullblown jury trial 
obviously the hearing is going to complicate things said 
harry first a new york university law school expert on 
whitecollar crime i think this is fairly uncharted stuff 
others said it was the first time a judge in a whitecollar case 
had ordered what is known in legal circles as a fatico hearing it 
is named after carmine fatico a truck hijacker who was sentenced 
partly on the basis of a hearing into an uncharged crime his 
alleged membership in the mafia 
if the government wants the judge to consider something you 
werent convicted of the defense has a right to challenge it 
said lawyer thomas puccio a former assistant us attorney who 
prosecuted the fatico case thats what the hearing is for 
if wood were to conclude milken engaged in a pattern of 
cheating bribery insider trading and obstruction of justice from 
the junkbond trading desk at drexel as the prosecution alleged in 
its sentencing memorandum she would likely order a fairly harsh 
sentence 
on the other hand if she found him the benign generous 
philanthropist depicted by the defense shed be more inclined to 
give him a relatively mild punishment 
in any case wood cannot order milken imprisoned for more than 
the 28year maximum on the six counts in his plea many lawyers 
have said she might sentence him to far less even if she believed 
elements of the prosecutors portrayal because he has promised to 
cooperate in other probes 
milken is the biggest figure to fall in the securities fraud 
scandals of the 80s as measured by his prominence and the record 
600 million in fines and penalties he agreed to pay in his plea 
bargain 
by contrast boesky paid 100 million pleaded guilty to one 
count and received a threeyear term investment banker dennis b 
levine got two years imprisonment and a 362000 fine for insider 
trading mergers specialist martin a siegel received a twomonth 
prison term 3000 hours of community service and five years 
probation 
some legal experts interpreted woods decision to hold a special 
hearing as a sign that she found little to guide her toward a fair 
sentence from either the defense or the prosecution 
prosecutors implied milken should get at least six times the 
punishment of boesky since he paid six times the fine and admitted 
six times the crimes 
wood seemed to reject that implication at the presentencing 
hearing last week 
but she seemed no more persuaded by the defenses testimonials 
from people ranging from milkens childhood math teacher to the los 
angeles police chief beseeching her to view milken as a contrite 
firsttime offender who didnt care much about money and gave most 
of it away milkens defenders urged her to spare him from prison 
and let him work with innercity children 
what ultimately may arise from woods special hearing legal 
experts say is the first substantive look at the true strength of 
the governments case against milken had it gone to trial 
i applaud what she did said john coffee a columbia law 
school professor who has been following milkens case 
now were really going to get to that truthfinding function 
that the criminal justice system is designed for he said 
were going to have people tell us what happened

extraordinary twoweek hearing in midoctober to consider the

gold futures prices followed energy prices in an upward spiral 
friday but slipped late in the day amid signs the government is 
trying to halt runaway speculation that produced a volatile week on 
the commodity and stock markets 
gold settled 330 to 250 lower on new yorks commodity 
exchange with the contract for delivery in september at 40250 a 
troy ounce 
energy futures showed signs of breaking the 40abarrel barrier 
once again friday but fell in the last hour of trading after the 
house okd plans to test release 15 million gallons of crude 
from the strategic oil reserves 
light sweet crude oil settled 3 cents lower to 45 cents higher 
with november at 3951 a barrel heating oil was 10 cent lower to 
61 cent higher with october at 10498 a gallon unleaded gasoline 
was 97 cent to 24 cent lower with october at 10176 a gallon 
optimism that a federal budget compromise will be reached over 
the weekend and speculation that president bush was prepared to 
take unspecified action should crude top 40 also contributed to 
the turnaround analysts said 
on other commodity markets silver and platinum extended their 
losses soybean futures prices slipped grains were mixed 
livestock futures were mixed and pork futures were higher

exchange and settled 370 to 420 lower with october at 43310 a

quiet trading on the chicago board of trade 
soybeans opened with early support following yesterdays 
afterclosing release of the agriculture departments quarterly 
report on the estimated stockpile of grains in the united states 
but that support quickly eroded amid pressure from the upcoming 
expected betterthannormal harvest and little export demand 
analysts said 
traders had expected slight gains in the soybean and grain 
markets but were surprised by lackluster trading said david 
armstrong an analyst for agrivisor services inc in bloomington 
the usda report obviously wasnt enough to bring any new 
buying and there wasnt any bad news to bring a lot of selling 
armstrong said 
wheat futures also opened slightly higher but fell on 
professional selling and continued questions about whether the 
soviet union will accept a government offer to buy subsidized wheat 
flour 
corn suffered from minimal nearterm export demand and the 
approach of active harvesting 
wheat futures settled 1 cents lower to cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 277 a bushel corn futures 
were cent lower to cent higher with december at 228 a bushel 
oats were 3 cents to 5 cents higher with december at 121 a 
bushel soybeans were 3 cents to cent lower with november at

budget agreement 
live hog futures ended mostly higher as traders awaited the 
afterclosing release of the agriculture departments thirdquarter 
hogs and pigs report which showed a lowerthanexpected herd and 
smaller numbers kept for breeding and marketing than was forecast 
pork bellies futures were boosted by hog futures prices and 
speculation that frozen pork bellies stocks are nearly depleted 
leaving the burden of bacon demand to the fresh market 
live cattle settled 53 cent lower to 20 cent higher with 
october at 7905 cents a pound feeder cattle futures were 20 cent

xerox corp plans to unveil a product tuesday it 
calls its most important development since it introduced the modern 
copying machine 31 years ago 
the new device is a combination copier fax image scanner and 
document printer designed to tie together these nowseparate 
operations at large companies 
using the machine a worker could push a button on his desktop 
computer and order up one or several hundred highquality 
bound copies of a 50page report he also could send a fax of a 
computer document to another computer user industry analysts say 
in addition the machine could electronically scan in paper 
documents that then could be stored in a computer or manipulated on 
a computer screen 
its really meant to bring the copier into the computer 
network said ann palermo an analyst at the market research firm 
international data corp 
the device is considered a gamble by xerox which has been 
disappointed in the past by making technological breakthroughs only 
to lose the market for them to other companies 
they have spent a fortune on the development of this system 
said eugene glazer an analyst at dean witter reynolds inc he said 
the research cost ran into the hundreds of millions of dollars 
the people that have seen it are very impressed he said 
but he added the market potential for the device expected to 
cost at least 200000 is uncertain 
theyre trying to create a market and the question is can 
they create it at that price said peter enderlin an analyst at 
smith barney harris upham and co 
added glazer theyll be introducing it into a difficult 
economic environment where the budgets of potential user 
organizations will be under constraints 
xerox wouldnt discuss details of the product but it called a 
news conference tuesday in new york to make what it called its most 
important announcement since it introduced the automatic plain 
paper copier in 1959 
it did say the announcement is a followup to its unveiling last 
month of a new personal computer and software designed to tie 
together computer users throughout a company 
xerox apparently views the new device as a way for companies to 
centralize control over the proliferation of paper and computer 
documents the machine could be another step in the longpromised 
paperless office since it would allow paper documents to be 
stored on computers instead of in file cabinets 
such electronic imaging systems are offered by other 
companies but have not yet found a mass market 
computer industry giants such as international business machines 
corp and unisys corp have stepped up their promotion of imaging 
devices in recent months but most are aimed at specific markets 
particularly banking 
a product like this if its at a low enough price and has 
enough features could really help drive the growth of document 
image processing enderlin said of the xerox machine 
ms palermo said the new machine believed to be called the 
docutech publisher could replace print shops at major companies 
she said highspeed printing devices used for highquality 
multiplecopy reproduction cost about 150000 so the anticipated 
price of the xerox machine is not out of line 
enderlin said investors apparently arent excited about the 
announcement xeroxs stock price has fallen in recent weeks as 
has the market in general since news of the machine began to 
appear 
last month eastman kodak co unveiled a new highspeed document 
printer also designed to work with networks of desktop computers 
but the machine lacks the faxing and scanning capabilities of the 
xerox model 
analysts say no similar machine exists but the most likely 
potential competitor would be kodak along with japanese copier 
giants such as canon 
xerox invented the personal computer the userfriendly 
graphical software to run it and the computer control device called 
the mouse only to see them slip out of its hands and enrich 
competitors who marketed them better 
but despite the money xerox spent on developing the new office 
machine no one is predicting the stamford connbased company 
will be hurt if it fails to catch on 
the core copier business will keep going for quite a few more 
years based on replacements and the service business enderlin 
said

whitman corp on friday announced it will spin 
off its slumping pet foods division consolidate several of its 
operations and lay off about 1000 employees 
the company said it will take a charge against its thirdquarter 
earnings to pay for the spinoff and costcutting program which 
will cause losses for the quarter and year 
the reorganization is an attempt by the consumer products 
conglomerate to cope with lagging profitability particularly at 
its pet specialty food unit and its hussman corp division 
we are taking this action because we believe it holds the best 
potential for increasing shareholder value over time said james 
cozad whitman chairman and chief executive officer 
the restructuring will also produce a substantial reduction in 
costs by eliminating positions throughout the organization cozad 
said in a news release and it will put us in a strong position 
to build for the future 
pet which provides about half the companys sales and profits 
is suffering from sinking market shares and lower profit margins 
the divisions reported operating income now is about 10 percent 
below last years level whitman said 
miles marsh whitman president and chief operating officer will 
become chairman and ceo of pet when it is spun off the company 
said 
to cover the cost of the spinoff whitman will take a special 
onetime aftertax charge against third quarter earnings of 150 
million it said the charge will cause a substantial net loss 
in whitmans third quarter and a loss for the full year the 
company said 
about 1000 jobs throughout whitmans organization will be 
eliminated through attrition retirements and terminations 
whitman which also owns midas international pepsicola 
general bottlers and the hussmann foodequipment unit attempted 
earlier this year to sell hussmann but withdrew it from the market 
after failing to receive high enough bids 
hussmann which had a weak first half will have operating 
income down about 20 percent from last year whitman reported

oil prices closed little changed friday in a 
quiet yet volatile session friday traders saw evidence that 
president bushs attempt to calm the energy markets was having some 
effect 
the november contract for delivery of light sweet crude fell 3 
cents to 3951 a 42gallon barrel on the new york mercantile 
exchange after trading as high as 3995 a barrel and falling as 
low as 3865 later contract months closed narrowly higher 
there was no news directly from the middle east to influence 
trading but the house voted during the afternoon to triple to 15 
million barrels the amount of oil the government can remove from 
the nations strategic petroleum reserve the vote was expected by 
the market but still had a sobering effect on trading 
also putting a damper on prices was speculation that the new 
york merc would increase its margin requirements to limit the 
amount of money traders could borrow to purchase oil contracts 
such a move would drive speculative traders out reduce the 
volatility in the market and force prices down said nauman 
barakat a senior trader with merrill lynch energy futures 
despite such bearish news prices did not fall sharply friday 
because they were supported by buying from traders afraid events 
over the weekend might send prices down further said jim fiedler 
an energy market analyst with e d amp f man international futures 
inc 
bushs decision wednesday to tap 5 million barrels from the 590 
millionbarrel oil reserve was having some of the calming effect on 
the market that the president sought analysts said 
prices responded only briefly on thursday to his decision but 
analysts saw more of a reaction friday 
although the president cannot control what happens in a free 
market theres a general feeling that bush is putting quite a 
bit of political pressure on the industry to keep the price below 
40 said fiedler noting that bush has pressured oil companies 
in the past to keep prices down 
bush is saying read my lips i want crude to stay below 
40 fiedler said 
oil prices did cross the 40abarrel mark briefly thursday but 
fell back the october contracts for refined petroleum products 
expired friday causing some volatility but as in the market for 
crude trading was dominated by concerns about the middle east 
home heating oil for october delivery rose 061 cent to 10498 
a gallon and subsequent months also advanced seasonal factors 
also contributed to heating oils gains as demand for oil rises in 
the fall 
wholesale unleaded gasoline futures declined also influenced by 
seasonal factors the end of the summer driving season october 
gasoline dropped 093 cent to 10176 a gallon later months also 
declined 
in natural gas trading the november contract fell to 1935 per

a federal judge has delayed sentencing michael 
milken until she holds an extraordinary inquiry based on a broad 
array of unproven charges against the fallen junkbond financier 
us district judge kimba m wood said in her surprise ruling 
thursday that the purpose of the hearing which lawyers called a 
first in a whitecollar crime case would be to gain a greater 
understanding of milken described as a conniving crook by 
prosecutors and a contrite philanthropist by his defense 
the judge had been scheduled to pronounce milkens sentence 
monday closing a major chapter in wall streets worst scandal he 
faces a maximum 28 years imprisonment after pleading guilty to six 
felonies in april 
but as the judgment day approached federal prosecutors sought 
to persuade wood that milkens crimes are far more extensive and 
should be taken into account as she deliberates his punishment 
defense attorneys argued she should sentence milken only on the 
charges hes admitted 
wood said in ordering the sentencing hearing that it would be 
held for approximately two weeks sometime next month and structured 
to allow each side to present testimony and evidence supporting 
their positions 
federal law allows her to consider any information about a 
defendant in determining an appropriate sentence 
her ruling immediately raised the prospect of an unofficial 
trial for milken extending what his lawyers called a painful 
ordeal for the fallen pioneer of highyield bond trading at drexel 
burnham lambert inc 
i was hoping we could dispense with this his lead attorney 
arthur liman said such a hearing he told the judge could 
prolong an extraordinary anguish and agony for my clients 
family 
on the other hand the hearing could provide an opportunity for 
milkens defense team to at last confront ivan f boesky the 
convicted speculator who first implicated milken in a maze of 
financial corruption in 1986 
ill finally get to try this case after four years liman 
told reporters later outside the courtroom 
the judge tentatively scheduled a conference between the 
prosecutors and milkens lawyers tuesday to further define the 
extent of the hearing it was unclear when milken would be 
sentenced 
wood made her decision after reading voluminous presentencing 
memorandums from both the prosecution and defense she ordered them 
released this week in censored form deleting incriminating 
references to milken associates 
the judge also has received hundreds of letters both supporting 
and denouncing milken by far the biggest figure to fall in the 
wall street securities fraud scandal that has snared a number of 
whitecollar executives 
wood who at 46 is the youngest judge in the manhattan federal 
court has proceeded with extreme caution in the milken case her 
first nationally prominent sentencing decision since she was 
appointed two years ago lawyers said her ruling thursday reflected 
this concern 
she wants to give both sides an opportunity to explore matters 
in their sentencing memorandums said ira l sorkin a prominent 
securities attorney and former federal prosecutor i think she 
wants to make as complete a record as possible because the 
sentencing process is very difficult at best 
in what appeared to be a small victory for milkens defense the 
judge also made it clear she has rejected an argument by 
prosecutors that milkens sentence should be longer than the 
threeyear term of boesky who pleaded guilty to a single felony 
and paid 100 million in fines 
wood further revealed she has rejected an assertion by 
prosecutors that milken became exceedingly charitable only after 
the government began investigating him her own probation 
department report she said showed milken has been charitable for 
many years as the defense has argued

the persian gulf crisis and its negative 
impact on east european economies has sent the viennese stock 
market into a tailspin after two years of outperforming other 
european bourses 
from an alltime high of 73921 points on march 13 the 
exchanges boersenkammer index slumped to a low of 46468 this 
week 
and since aug 1 the day before iraq invaded kuwait and sent 
oil prices rocketing and international markets reeling the index 
has been europes worst casualty off 35 percent 
viennas bourse had seen record levels of growth for two years 
as investors were attracted by strong economic growth low 
inflation and changes in eastern europe 
daily turnover rocketed from 20 million schillings 18 
million a day in early 1988 to a peak this year of 12 billion 
schillings 109 million 
some traders say prices were too high and now that world bourses 
are crashing its not surprising vienna was hardest hit 
the market was driven up partly by fantasies about making 
money in eastern europe and vienna was seen as the center for 
that now that fantasy has gone said one stock trader at a 
leading austrian bank speaking on condition of anonymity 
vienna the old capital of the austrohungarian empire is still 
considered the center of economic activity for eastern europe it 
has a long tradition as a hub for other major cities and regions in 
the area is centrally located and has all of the transportation 
and communications links needed for business activity 
higher oil prices from the gulf crisis are hitting east european 
countries hard just as they are grappling with the difficult task 
of switching to freer markets 
romanian officials for example estimate the gulf crisis has 
cost their country nearly 3 billion 
iraq was to pay 70 percent of its 17 billion debt to bucharest 
in oil but payment has been frozen the recent rise in oil prices 
to 38 a barrel will cost the economy another 770 million 
moscow is now selling oil at market prices for hard cash 
meaning eastern europe can no longer count on receiving soviet 
crude at regulated prices or in barter trade for chickens or 
trucks 
in czechoslovakia gasoline prices have risen 50 percent this 
year mainly because the soviets slashed crude supplies by 15 
percent hungary has also upped prices after moscow interrupted 
supplies 
some analysts noted that investors had begun losing interest in 
eastern europe even before the gulf crisis 
people had already begun to realize after initial euphoria 
that profits wouldnt be flowing so ast out of the east said 
josef oswald chief analyst at creditanstalt bank 
but he stressed that austrias economic growth at 45 percent 
this year and a likely 375 percent to 4 percent in 1991 is still 
stronger than the european average inflation is only at 32 
percent

a bumper vegetable crop is rotting in the fields 
as the first fall frost approaches and muscovites fearing a hungry 
winter have joined soldiers and schoolchildren trying to rescue 
potatoes 
some people have become so desperate they are stealing potatoes 
carrots pickles and preserves from individually owned vegetable 
cellars in the villages surrounding moscow soviet media report 
the komsomolskaya pravda newspaper quoted one elderly russian 
peasant woman as saying if my memory doesnt fail me that only 
happened before the famine of 47 alas this is a really bad 
sign 
soviet prime minister nikolai ryzhkov admits that at best only 
onethird of the vegetable crop has been harvested so far and 
soviet media said thursday only a fraction of that has made its way 
to moscow warehouses and markets 
a hungry winter is coming the official tass news agency 
predicted it is unprecedented in the history of the soviet union 
in the last week of september that only 37 percent of the potatoes 
needed for moscow this winter are in storage in the city 
potatoes are a mainstay of the soviet diet known as second 
bread after the other staple that also was in short supply this 
summer for the first time since the early 1960s 
if potatoes disappear from the counter this will be a 
catastrophe for the pensioners students and poor people 
komsomolskaya pravda said 
the soviet union annually loses 20 percent to 30 percent of its 
food harvest on the way to market this years problems have been 
compounded by bad weather and fuel shortages for farm machinery 
moscowarea farms have been drenched with twice the average 
rainfall in the first two weeks of september and farmers complain 
their antiquated harvesting machines no longer work in the muddy 
fields 
students and soldiers were drafted into the harvest weeks ago 
and last week leaders of moscows regional government invited city 
dwellers to go to collective and state farms to dig potatoes for 
their own use 
in an indication how desperate the situation has become defense 
minister dmitri yazov told the soviet legislature on wednesday that 
23000 soldiers based in the moscow region are helping to dig 
potatoes 
individuals are entitled to keep every sixth sack of potatoes 
they dig or pay about 20 cents per pound for their entire bounty 
two more weeks of such weather and the whole potato crop 
will perish said the head of the moscow regional government 
department responsible for vegetable and fruit production 
it has been under water for two months already and it is 
becoming rotten not only combines but also digging machines 
cant move along the fields so the only two instruments we have 
are hands and shovel the official l yegan told moskovksy 
komsomolets newspaper 
he said at least three days of clear weather followed by two 
weeks without heavy rain were needed to salvage the harvest 
otherwise we can cross it out 
the council of ministers the soviet cabinet adopted a 
resolution on tuesday to step up the harvest effort it said bad 
weather poor management lack of discpline and lack of cooperation 
between urban and rural governments had created a real threat 
that a sizeable part of the harvest may be lost 
the resolution would send blue and whitecollar workers to work 
on farms even if it meant the suspension of some urban businesses 
and further enlistment of armed forces help in harvesting and 
transportation the resolution also directed police to step up 
antiprofiteering and antisabotage efforts it was not clear when 
the resolution would take effect 
the dmitrov city council near moscow took an even more drastic 
step declaring a state of emergency it ordered at least 20 
percent of factory workers at least half the scientific workers 
and up to 70 percent of administrators and its own executive 
committee workers to assist the harvest

there arent many opportunities left to expand 
coal use despite the increased demand placed on oil since saddam 
husseins invasion of kuwait analysts say 
coal boomed in the 1970s partly because utilities used it to 
wean themselves from a dependence on foreign oil utilities spent 
millions to convert power plants from burning oil to coal 
mansions and mercedes appeared in appalachian coalfields as mine 
owners profited from the rapid demand 
but the bonanza is over the big conversion to coal has already 
taken place and shortterm growth prospects now look dim in both 
the domestic and export markets while oil prices have soared since 
the aug 2 invasion coal has been steady 
nothings going to happen here for a six to ninemonth period 
because of iraq said joel price coal analyst for donaldson 
lufkin and jenrette 
he and other industry observers listed several reasons why coal 
hasnt been affected by the gulf crisis 
coal barely competes with oil as a domestic energy source 
during the 1973 opec oil embargo oil generated nearly 17 percent 
of the nations electricity now it provides only 4 percent to 5 
percent in the same period coals share grew 10 percent to about 
56 percent of the nations electric output according to the us 
energy information administration 
no sudden demand for coal is forecast at home utilities burn 
about 80 percent of all coal mined in america and theres a surplus 
of coal on the market utilities arent expected to convert the few 
existing oilfired plants to burn coal said price and others 
there isnt much room for oil to be backed out further said 
john grasser spokesman for the national coal association in 
washington utilities probably will switch to cleanburning natural 
gas to meet sudden demand 
sudden growth in exports has not occurred 
there is not much movement at all in terms of requests for 
greater tonnages or a runup in prices said thomas hoffman vice 
president of public relations for consolidation coal co inc in 
pittsburgh consol is a large exporter 
united states coal companies hope to sell more coal to european 
utilities with universal boilers which burn either coal oil or 
natural gas the us exported about 10 percent of its coal 
production last year 
overseas there is some chance if war breaks out you might 
see coal take the place of some of the residual oil in europe 
said chuck linderman manager of fossil fuels program for edison 
electric institute in washington 
spot market prices for coal have stayed steady and in some cases 
declined since the aug 2 invasion that reflects an oversupply in 
the market thats existed for several years 
we have had the capacity for years to produce more coal than 
what the market demanded said tom duncan kentucky coal 
association president 
price said rising oil prices however will affect the coal 
industry eventually mine owners will have to pay more for diesel 
and transportation costs will rise spot market prices will rise to 
reflect these costs he predicted 
and coal will suffer not profit if the gulf crisis brings on a 
recession price added plant closings or large layoffs among us 
manufacturers will reduce demand for electricity and a drop in 
power demand will cause a drop in the need for coal said price 
coals promise lies in the long term 
marc cohen coal analyst for kidder peabody amp co in new york 
predicted that utilities looking for new power sources will seek 
coal over generating stations oil nuclear and hydroelectric 
power 
when you have new baseload growth coal once again will be the 
dominant kid on the block he said 
the pending clean air act legislation has placed low sulfur coal 
in high demand as utilities try to meet the tough new air pollution 
regulations the powder river basin in wyoming and portions of 
central appalachia will see job growth as low sulfur production 
picks up 
thousands of workers in high sulfur coal mines in the illinois 
basin will be sent packing because of the new environmental rules 
the environmental protection agency says 
others see coal fueling future modes of transportation such as 
electric trolleys and electric cars 
the only real area where coal could make the most inroads is 
the sector that uses the most oil and thats the transportation 
sector said john grasser spokesman for the national coal 
association in washington

customers may wind up paying the cost of higher 
deposit insurance premiums as banks already struggling to hold on 
to profits pass along the added costs industry analysts said 
the board of directors of the federal deposit insurance corp 
voted thursday to boost the premium banks pay by more than 60 
percent starting next year to shore up the deposit insurance 
system 
the fdic took the action after learning that the government fund 
protecting bank accounts dropped from 132 billion at the end of 
last year to 114 billion at the end of june a 14 percent 
decline 
fdic chairman l william seidman said in washington that he now 
expects by the end of the year the fund will have lost closer to 
3 billion rather than the 2 billion he earlier predicted 
under the premium increase banks will pay the fdic 195 cents 
in insurance for each 100 in deposits currently they pay 12 
cents per 100 in deposits 
the insurance increase could reduce profits in an 
alreadytroubled industry analysts said thursday but they added 
that the higher premiums were necessary to ensure the health of the 
banking system 
the fdic needs the money said christopher mahoney an 
analyst at moodys investors service the soundness of the fdic 
is important 
analysts believe many banks will try to pass on to customers 
some of the premium increase in the form of higher fees for 
checking accounts bounced checks and other services banks also 
may try to lower the interest they pay on savings accounts 
certificates of deposit and other investments 
if banks were to pass on to savings account customers the full 
75 cent increase a customer with 10000 in his account would 
lose 750 in interest over a year before compounding 
but such moves could be met with resistance and loss of 
customers analysts said 
its pretty hard to gouge the customer when the customer has 
other alternatives said eric hemel of the investment firm first 
boston corp he said savers could put their money in mutual funds 
or other investments or switch banks 
that means banks may be forced to absorb some or all of the 
insurance increase which could affect their earnings and be 
especially troubling to weaker institutions 
revenues at banks are not growing robustly so any increase in 
expenses is going to hurt said cheryl swaim of the investment 
firm oppenheimer amp co she estimated the higher premiums could 
lower overall bank profits by 2 percent to 3 percent 
ms swaim said most banks do not disclose the percentage of 
their expenses composed of fdic fees but one that does first 
wachovia corp of winstonsalem nc said its fdic cost was 3 
percent of its expenses 
its not ahuge chunk she said but for the banks that 
arent earning much money its going to be a higher percentage of 
their earnings 
the insurance increase could push barely profitable banks into 
the red in fact the fdic calculated that if the 1991 rate had 
been in effect last year 69 banks would have recorded losses 
instead of profits and four additional banks would have failed 
the american bankers association believes the increase also 
could lower the amount of money banks have available to make loans 
said spokeswoman ginnie dean 
she said the trade association supports the increase as a 
necessary step but believes changes in the fdic insurance program 
are needed insurance increases could be counterproductive in the 
long run because of their potential to make more banks 
unprofitable she added 
first bostons hemel said concern about the latest fdic 
insurance increase overlooks the bigger picture of what future 
increases may be needed to bail out troubled banks as the economy 
weakens he thinks future hikes could be much larger than the 1991 
increase 
the prices of many bank stocks tumbled thursday but analysts 
said it was due mostly to trouble reported by several major banks 
in recent days not to the insurance increase 
on thursday bank of boston said it expected to report a loss 
this quarter and would reduce its quarterly dividend by twothirds 
on wednesday ncnb corp a bank based in charlotte nc said 
it would report sharply lower earnings this quarter and would 
increase its reserves for potentially bad loans 
and last week chase manhattan corp the nations 
secondlargest bank said it expects a loss this quarter and would 
cut its dividend in half

the senate has unanimously passed more stock 
market reform legislation this time giving the securities and 
exchange commission authority to impose more fines and crack down 
on penny stock abuses 
the securities law enforcement remedies act increases sec powers 
to protect small investors against penny stock fraud 
an earlier senate version did not contain a penny stock 
provision but was similar in most other ways to the securities 
enforcement and penny stock reform act passed by the house on july 
23 
the new bill will give the sec the authority to bar crooked 
promoters and consultants from selling penny stocks highly 
speculative securities that sell for a few dollars or less 
while not illegal penny stocks are prone to fraud and are 
considered to be very risky at best 
the bill also would tighten disclosure requirements for some 
types of penny stocks 
this legislation will add new weapons to the arsenal of the 
securities and exchange commission to combat illegal activity in 
our securities markets said sen christopher dodd dconn who 
introduced the bill with sen john heinz rpa last year at the 
request of the sec 
the legislation also would 
give the sec the power to order alleged wrongdoers to cease 
and desist illegal activities without first having to go to court 
and obtain a restraining order 
widen sec authority to seek court orders barring convicted 
securities law violators from serving as officers or directors of 
companies with publiclytraded stock 
enact numerous reforms in the selling of penny stocks highly 
speculative securities that sell for a few dollars or less 
authorize new civil penalties for securities violators of up 
to 100000 per violation for an individual and up to 500000 for 
companies and other entities 
previously the sec had the power to impose fines only in 
insider trading cases for other violations such as fraudulent 
sales techniques the agency had no midlevel sanction it could 
only enjoin violators from repeating their activities or revoke 
their license which some have called the regulatory equivalent of 
the death penalty 
thursdays vote follows senate approval of another reform bill 
tuesday that will allow the sec to regulate the controversial 
computerized strategy of program trading in times of extreme market 
turbulence that bill also would give the sec authority to monitor 
large stock trades and the parent holding companies of brokerages 
it would also allow the agency to close the markets with the 
presidents approval in market emergencies 
tuesdays reforms will help curb market volatility to keep our 
stock markets safe for individual investors said sen donald 
riegle jr dmich chairman of the senate banking committee 
today we gave the sec added tools to police our markets and keep 
them safe from crooks

texas oilman t boone pickens mesa limited 
partnership has agreed to pay a of 72 million to settle two 
civil lawsuits including one by federal regulators alleging 
securities law violations 
the securities and exchange commission sued pickens and mesa for 
allegedly selling stock in a mining company after his announced 
plans to acquire it drove up the share price 
without admitting or denying wrongdoing pickens and mesa 
limited partnership a dallas energy concern agreed to settle with 
the sec thursday mesa agreed to put 23 million in alleged 
illegal profits into a fund to reimburse other investors 
in another development mesa announced it had agreed to pay 49 
million to settle a 6yearold class action lawsuit brought by 
phillips petroleum co shareholders against mesa and phillips 
mesa phillips and other defendants agreed to pay a total 67 
million to settle the suit brought by shareholders unhappy with how 
phillips headed off a takeover bid by pickens that settlement is 
subject to a judges approval at federal court in delaware 
in 1984 mesa offered 60 a share in cash for up to 23 million 
of phillips 1546 million outstanding common shares and was 
considering further shareholder enticements when it dropped the bid 
in an agreement with bartlesville oklabased phillips 
under the agreement mesa said it would sell back its 89 
million shares of phillips stock to the company for 53 a share in 
cash giving mesa a pretax profit of 89 million 
in some quarters this is considered greenmail where a party 
threatens a takeover but profits from forcing the company to buy 
back its stock at a premium this kind of behavior earned pickens 
who also launched unsuccessful bids against unocal corp and gulf 
corp the reputation of corporate raider 
in a statement mesa said it still denies it violated any laws 
but the risk and expense of litigation make this settlement an 
appropriate resolution of these issues 
a spokesman for pickens in washington said in both cases boone 
wanted to get these lawsuits behind him so he could concentrate on 
the energy market 
the spokesman mark helmke denied that the sec lawsuit had 
anything to do with pickens stepping down earlier this month as 
head of the united shareholders association a grassroots 
investors rights group he founded in 1986 
theres no linkage at all boone just wanted to broaden the 
base of usa said helmke 
charles cox a former sec commissioner was named to succeed 
pickens at usa 
the secs civil complaint filed at federal court in texas 
charged pickens and mesa with alleged securities law violations 
involving the sale of common stock and call options of homestake 
mining inc a san francisco gold mining company which is publicly 
traded on the new york stock exchange 
call options give an investor the right but not the obligation 
to buy shares at a fixed price at a later date they are used in 
trading strategies betting that a stocks price will rise 
the sec claimed that mesa issued a news release that was 
materially false or misleading about its intentions to acquire 
homestake without revealing that it also intended to sell homestake 
shares it already held 
sec regulations require anyone holding 5 percent or more of a 
companys shares to disclose it at the time mesa only had a 38 
percent stake some 35 million shares 
the sec charged that on feb 29 1988 mesa issued a press 
release stating its intentions to acquire homestake in a negotiated 
transaction the market price of homestakes shares rose nearly 4 
per share to more than 18 on the news 
that same day mesa began selling homestake shares without 
updating the press release 
between that day and march 11 mesa sold more than 33 million 
shares of homestake stock and 3331 homestake call options 
the sec complaint alleged that as a result of the failure to 
state all facts necessary to update the press release mesa and 
pickens violated federal securities laws
