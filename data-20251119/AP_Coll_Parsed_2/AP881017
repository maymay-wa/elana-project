how she helped her husband escape from a rome military prison in

the uganda airlines jet that crashed near romes 
main airport killing 31 people was aiming for a seldomused runway 
that lacks sophisticated landing equipment an italian union 
official said 
the choice of the runway meant that the pilot had to calculate 
how to land the boeing 707 at the fogshrouded airport instead of 
having electronic equipment guide him said andrea gariup 
president of the main italian pilots union 
the red yellow and white jet plowed through three houses and a 
rentalcar parking lot before coming to rest in a field and 
bursting into flames early monday thirtyone people were killed 
including six of the seven crew members 21 were injured 
most of those on board flight qu775 were ugandans traveling from 
london to ugandas entebbe airport via leonardo da vinci airport 
two nigerians were listed among the injured while the british 
embassy in rome said seven or eight passengers were britons 
the airport said it did not yet have a complete list of 
passenger identities 
gariup said the pilot apparently chose runway 34 left 
because visibility was slightly better there than on two other 
runways he had previously approached 
however the strip lacked the instrument landing system 
installed at other runways to provide information to pilots about 
their altitude said gariup head of the national association of 
commercial airline pilots 
the pilot therefore had to target his descent using information 
from the control tower and his view of the runway gariup said 
the pilot had to calculate every minute based on the distance 
to the airport how he had to approach gariup said in a 
telephone interview monday night with the associated press with 
the other system the instruments would tell him if he was too 
low 
perhaps he miscalculated or perhaps he saw something else that 
he thought was the runway 
there was no answer at the airport directors office or the 
press office monday evening but an air traffic controller in the 
flight tower confirmed that the runway was not frequently used and 
lacked the landing equipment other strips had he spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
government and airport authorities emphasized that they had not 
yet established the cause of the crash the italian government 
announced monday evening that a nineman commission would 
investigate in addition to a judicial board 
the commander of the rome provinces fire department guido 
chiucini who helped coordinate the rescue speculated in a 
telephone interview that there was a misunderstanding between 
the control tower and the pilot since the plane approached at such 
a low altitude 
however the air traffic controllers union denied there had 
been any misunderstanding other officials noted there had not yet 
been an examination of the black box which records flight 
information data or the recordings of the pilots conversations 
with the tower 
among those who survived were a british dairy farmer and his 
26yearold wife who leaped from the burning aircraft clutching 
their 8monthold son 
we jumped out of a hole in the fuselage behind us geoffrey 
gait 31 told the associated press in an interview at santeugenio 
hospital ruth jumped backward holding baby richard to her 
chest and then fell about six feet to the ground i picked them 
up we walked about 200 yards and then some ugandans came out 
the gaits who suffered minor burns were on their way to the 
african nation to work with a charity project that provides farmers 
with cows 
chunks of the aircraft and passengers clothing covered a wide 
swath in the planes wake long after the crash hundreds of sheets 
of bluelined paper stamped uganda national examination board 
still blanketed the ground

shimon peres kissed a girl with flowers 
and shook hands with robeclad notables but once the organized 
hoopla was over the reception in this arab town for the labor 
party leader turned frosty 
polls show the leftofcenter labor party might lose half its 
arab support partly because labors no 2 man defense minister 
yitzhak rabin is held responsible for the harsh crackdown on the 
palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
labor and the rightwing likud bloc headed by prime minister 
yitzhak shamir are running necktoneck and a drop in arab support 
for labor could hand the nov 1 election to likud 
are you going to vote for us a shirtsleaved peres 
surrounded by a dozen security men asked a resident monday during 
a walking tour of shfaram a northern israeli town of 26000 
the man did not answer and instead told peres the town needed 
better roads responded peres if we get enough votes well get 
the finance ministry and then we can do it 
in an attempt at conviviality peres greeted a woman with the 
arabic phrase sabah ilher but after being told he had said 
good morning instead of the intended good evening peres 
stuck to hebrew 
most shfaram residents stayed indoors or watched from their 
balconies as peres and a few dozen party activists walked through 
the town which in 1984 gave half its votes to the communist party 
during a reception at the home of local labor party leader 
khalil mishal peres was handed flowers by mishals daughter who 
wore a hebrew sticker reading im also for labor 
mishal had invited about 150 arab notables who shook hands with 
peres and provided the backdrop for brief welcoming speeches 
at a later rally peres urged israeli arabs not to waste 
their votes on the communists or the progressive list for peace 
both are proplo and unacceptable to labor as coalition partners 
if this time there is no peace it will be the fault of the 
israeli arabs if you waste your votes nothing is going to 
happen peres told about 500 people who listened in silence and 
applauded briefly and politely at the end 
about 330000 of israels 800000 arab citizens are eligible to 
vote this year and could control 14 seats in the 120member 
parliament in 1984 one in four arabs voted labor giving the 
party the three seats that provided its 4441 advantage over likud 
but this year support for labor is slipping mainly because of 
growing israeli arab identification with the 10monthold uprising 
that has claimed at least 299 palestinian and six israeli lives 
analysts say labor could lose 15 seats in the arab sector 
many people dont want to vote for labor because of what rabin 
is doing in the occupied territories said a 37yearold 
carpenter in the arab town of nazareth near shfaram the man who 
said he supported labor in 1984 spoke on condition of anonymity 
asked whether rabin was a liability for labors arab campaign 
peres was evasive i think they arab voters must understand the 
situation as it is and i hope they will change their minds he 
told the associated press in shfaram 
but communist party activists in shfaram were optimistic that 
the revolt against israeli occupation would boost their chances 
well get more votes because of the uprising said local 
party leader sagir moussa 39 as he and other activists handed out 
leaflets saying yes to a palestinian state and long live the 
uprising 
his party might gain one seat this year bringing its total to 
five according to recent polls labor has conducted among arab 
voters the polls were cited by the jerusalem post newsaper 
according to the polls the progressive list for peace would 
maintain its strength with two seats while labor would win 15 
seats six other parties including the likud would share the 
remaining four seats an unidentified labor official told the 
newspaper monday 
a 26yearold shfaram resident who would only give his first 
name ahmed said he was not convinced by peres speech he also 
criticized peres for promising true equality better schools and 
more jobs for israeli arabs if labor is elected 
every four years they discover that we exist said ahmed a 
hairdresser they make promises but nothing changes

george bush on monday accused democrat 
michael dukakis of a total lack of understanding of our 
military and called the nov 8 election a referendum on military 
policy 
the vice president used a martinmarietta defense plant where 
star wars research is being conducted to launch his latest 
attack on dukakis 
i will not leave america defenseless against ballistic 
missiles bush told about 2500 company employees in the 
cavernous assembly plant where titan iv rockets are built 
the vice president made the comments before flying to chicago 
where he addressed a jewish group at the holocaust memorial in 
skokie ill bush told his audience that the relationship between 
israel and the united states has never been better never been 
stronger 
at the martinmarietta plant in the foothills of the rocky 
mountains bush ridiculed dukakis for opposing continued ballistic 
missile flight testing 
we need to modernize we need to test and we cant defend 
america with blueprints bush said 
and he scoffed at the democrats position on the reagan 
administrations strategic defense initiative or star wars 
program 
dukakis has been highly critical of the proposed system 
designed to destroy incoming soviet missiles in space but has 
also said during the campaign that he might support some continued 
research 
noting that dukakis had once called the program a fantasy bush 
asked why spend a dime if you think its a fantasy 
attacking dukakis for his opposition to new missile systems and 
for his emphasis on stronger conventional forces has been a main 
bush campaign theme 
bush was planning to introduce that theme in an ad using footage 
of dukakis riding around in a tank during a campaign visit to 
michigan said campaign spokeswoman sheila tate 
although ms tate had no information on a washington post report 
tuesay that the campaign was tentatively planning to spend more 
than 15 million of its 30 millionplus advertising in three 
states she said three new ads were being aired tuesday and a new 
ad was being shot then the three states are california new jersey 
and ohio the post said 
bush declared on monday that with the next century approaching 
it is all that more important for us to understand the role that 
our defense has played in securing the peace the role our military 
forces must continue to play if americas future is also to be 
secure 
and this election is a referendum about that role 
at skokie bush stood in a violent thunderstorm at an outdoor 
rally for the dedication where he said i am committed to the 
survival of israel israel has survived will survive has 
flourished will flourish 
bush talked about the importance of maintaining the strategic 
relationship with israel and joked i wish that the lord had 
given us a little bit of a different weather condition he works in 
strange and mysterious ways 
bush did not mention the controversial effort by the american 
nazi party to hold a march in skokie in 1978 in which the nazis 
were represented by the american civil liberties union the nazis 
decided at the last minute to hold their march in neighboring 
chicago 
bush has frequently criticized dukakis for his membership in the 
aclu aides said the visit should be viewed reinforcement of bushs 
criticism 
with polls showing the vice president pulling ahead of dukakis 
including an nbcwall street journal poll monday showing bush ahead 
5538 republican strategists say bush will focus on a few 
proveneffective themes such as defense in the remaining three 
weeks before the election 
bush donned a bright blue work jacket as he toured the 
martinmarietta plant accompanied by james r schlesinger who has 
served in cabinet jobs in both democratic and republican 
administrations 
the vice president was shown a simulator for a laser weapon 
system to be based on an orbiting space station called rapid 
retargeting precision pointing or by its facetious code name 
r2p2 
bush was told by martinmarietta vice president morris h 
thorson that the device was so accurate that it could hit a 
basketball on top of the empire state building in new york from 
pikes peak in colorado 
schlesinger defense secretary and cia director for president 
ford and energy secretary for president carter told the plant 
employees that the presidency is no place for onthejob 
training 
bush said that the massachusetts governors refusal to back new 
nuclear systems and his willingness to cut two aircraft carriers 
indicates his total lack of understanding of our military 
governor its time to stop running down our defenses bush 
said 
meanwhile bush said he favors a possible mix for a new 
generation of mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles between 
the midgetman missile and a railbased mx missile system but not 
full deployment of both 
dennis ross bushs foreign policy adviser said going ahead 
with both weapons systems would cost some 60 billion and that 
bush wanted to keep the costs of the program to about half that

a racial slur uttered in frustration nearly 
ended lois bostics 27year career in education then her black 
students stepped in taught their elders a lesson in tolerance and 
saved mrs bostics job 
we were ready to forgive and go on said senior angela 
matthews 17 one of six students who initiated typed and 
distributed petitions in support of the white librarian anybody 
ought to get a second chance 
after the slur was reported last month parents in this farming 
town 80 miles southeast of little rock circulated petitions calling 
for mrs bostics ouster and she told school officials she would 
quit the board promptly endorsed her decision 
but then high school students mounted their own petition drive 
the school board rescinded its resolution and mrs bostic is here 
to stay 
mrs bostic who is in her first year here teaching both 
elementary and high school students said her troubles began sept 
27 as she taught her seventh class of the day on using the library 
at gould elementary 
as she recalls it the 20 sixthgraders in the class werent 
paying attention and were growing increasingly rowdy in an effort 
to settle them down she told the students all of them black i 
think youre trying to make me think youre a bunch of poor dumb 
niggers and i dont think that 
mrs bostic 50 said she immediately realized the 
inappropriateness of the word 
i opened my mouth and put my foot in it she said in an 
interview in our part of the country we call each other hicks 
and hillbillies and thats ok but if somebody from california 
moves in and they refer to us as hillbillies we get angry and i 
realized that it was wrong 
i was at my ropes end i was just trying to get these kids to 
behave i wasnt even conscious that i was using a word that would 
offend them she said 
children told their parents about the remarks and parents went 
to the school board in this town of 1670 people about 60 percent 
of them black 
on oct 3 a petition calling for mrs bostics dismissal was 
presented to the board many of the 91 parents who circulated and 
signed it say they remembered routine discrimination and hateful 
use of the word in their youth the parents petition alleged other 
insulting racial remarks had been made by mrs bostic she denied 
that and said her only use of the slur was before the 
sixthgraders it was she told the board a dumb stupid 
mistake 
mrs bostic recalls that she didnt encounter many blacks while 
growing up in southern missouri that word i used is not part of 
my vocabulary my mother would have slapped me across the mouth if 
id said that when i was growing up she said 
overhearing the word in conversations between black students 
usually in a humorous context mrs bostic concluded she could 
relate to them better if she used it i had no prejudices i was 
going to be one of them and went so far as using a word i should 
not have used that i didnt realize would offend them she said 
repentant and tearful the librarian announced she would quit by 
the end of that week the school board endorsed her exit saying 
she had lost effectiveness 
mrs bostic was preparing to move out of town with her retiree 
husband her career ended less than three months after she moved 
to arkansas 
on the day before her selfimposed departure deadline she 
learned that pupils were circulating petitions asking the board to 
reconsider they bore signatures from 124 of the towns 147 high 
school students only two of whom are white 
surprised board members reopened their discussion and reversed 
the request for mrs bostics resignation its their school 
theyre the ones that have to be with her every day said school 
board president alan minor who is black 
we figured this why would this woman move to this town with 
more blacks than whites if shes a bigot she just made a bad 
mistake and we decided she deserved a second chance said senior 
class president roy rainey iii 17 
mrs bostic said rainey a lanky basketball center is my hero 
right now he came to my defense it was my miracle 
home economics teacher doris rucker one of five blacks on the 
13person high school faculty praised the students im so proud 
of them they showed us the way she said 
im encouraged about the future of our little town said 
mayor dave rochelle who is white this petition indicates we 
have 124 young citizens who are good people

wildfires sunday threatened centuriesold 
giant sequoia trees in the states midsection and crackled toward 
homes along the mountain ridges surrounding los angeles 
the fires erupted during another california fall heat wave with 
temperatures nudging 100 degrees in many areas and santa ana winds 
dried and heated by inland deserts reaching 30 mph 
more than 3500 acres were blackened in the fires several of 
them mancaused authorities said a windpushed 2000acre blaze 
in the angeles national forest endangered homes in the path of the 
flames 30 miles north of los angeles 
the fires huge brown smoke plume rising 7000 feet skyward 
could be seen 50 miles away at los angeles international airport 
mountain residents of the northeast san fernando valley were put 
on alert but no evacuations were ordered about 200 firefighters 
were battling the blaze and hundreds more were on the way late in 
the afternoon 
this one is giving us real problems said us forest 
service spokesman bruce bundick its going in about three 
different directions faster than we can corral it 
about 160 miles northwest firefighters battling a 600acre fire 
in sequoia national park were optimistic a buffer zone cleared in a 
previous controlled burn would save the magnificent trees in the 
3squaremile giant forest said park spokesman bill tweed 
the ancient trees are considered the largest living things on 
earth 
these are certainly one of the biological wonders of the 
world tweed said the fire will inevitably reach the edge of 
the giant forest we think that because of the steps taken we can 
prevent it from going into the forest 
about 100 campers fled the flames which started at 8 am in 
potwisha camp ground about 30 miles northeast of visalia a 
careless camper or angler was the suspected cause of the blaze 
tweed said 
another fire 85 miles southeast of los angeles in riverside 
county charred 800 acres near hemet but firefighters were gaining 
the upper hand and containment was anticipated by dawn monday said

president john f kennedy harvard class 
of 1940 couldnt resist some goodnatured teasing when yale 
awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1962 
as general de gaulle occasionally acknowledged america to be 
the daughter of europe so i am pleased to come to yale the 
daughter of harvard kennedy told graduates assembled in the 
courtyard of yales old campus on that sunny june day 
it might be said now that i have the best of both worlds a 
harvard education and a yale degree kennedy said 
this years presidential campaign has elevated what is perhaps 
the oldest most intense and most snobbish rivalry in america to a 
new height 
for the spoils of this contest will go either to a yale man or a 
harvard man only the second time in 200 years that graduates of 
the two schools have vied for the presidency of the united states 
and the only other time it happened in 1912 the harvard man 
theodore roosevelt and the yale man william howard taft both 
lost to a princeton man woodrow wilson 
while kennedy was a master at exploiting his harvard education 
for political advantage republican george bush yale class of 
1948 has tried to turn democrat michael s dukakis harvard 
connections into a campaign liability 
bush scion of a wealthy greenwich conn family accuses the 
massachusetts governor the son of greek immigrants of having a 
harvard boutique mentality tainted by liberalism and 
elitism 
campaigning saturday in modesto calif bush said i dont 
want somebody from harvard telling me what i can do and what i 
cant do 
asked about that statement at a news conference sunday bush 
said he did not want to take on the institution itself asking 
how can i a nice guy from yale feel that way about harvard now 
come on 
im talking about a handful of people that have served in 
recent democratic administrations that come out of the same 
liberal philisophy and they know who they are he said 
theres an elite inside the elite there 
dukakis in turn has tried to stay out of the harvardyale 
debate saying his 1960 harvard law degree and teaching stint at 
harvards kennedy school of government dont make him a harvard man 
at all 
im a swarthmore guy dukakis says referring to the liberal 
arts college in pennsylvania where he received his undergraduate 
degree 
but bushs harvard line held little sting given his own ivy 
league connections and it probably was lost on most americans who 
view both yale and harvard as elite eastern universities for the 
wealthy 
dukakis campaign aides couldnt hold their tongues when outgoing 
education secretary william bennett himself a harvard law school 
graduate asserted on national television in september that the 
harvard crowd with which mike dukakis runs think theyre 
smarter than most americans 
bill bennett spent seven or eight years getting an education 
in massachussetts and these comments are a clear indication that it 
didnt do him a bit of good shot back mark gearan press 
secretary at dukakis boston headquarters 
harvard and yale have eyed each other with haughty disdain for 
nearly 300 years since yale was founded in 1701 by a group of 
clergy worried about religious backsliding at the more liberal 
harvard the oldest college in america harvard was founded in 
1636 just 16 years after the pilgrims landed at plymouth rock 
we have been natural rivals almost from the beginning 
george pierson the larned professor emeritus of history at yale 
said recently we were the only two with the exception of william 
and mary that you could go to after that we both grew in the 
favor of the lord 
the harvardyale annual crew race is the oldest intercollegiate 
sports rivalry in america dating from 1852 the schools refer to 
their annual football contest as the game as if all others 
hardly matter 
other harvardyale presidential campaigns have been averted only 
by quirks of history the 1824 election would have pitted harvard 
graduate john quincy adams against yale graduate john calhoun but 
calhoun dropped out and threw his support to adams who defeated 
andrew jackson who didnt have a college degree 
the 1876 contest between rutherford b hayes a graduate of 
harvard law school against samuel tilden would have been a 
harvardyale matchup except tilden dropped out of yale after one 
year and graduated from new york university 
although this is only the second headtohead match harvard and 
yale both boast presidents among their graduates while yale holds 
the edge in their football series 5640 and harvard holds the

republican sen john h chafee admits 
some people may find it ironic that richard a licht is challenging 
him in his run for a third senate term 
the democratic licht rhode islands lieutenant governor was 20 
years old when his uncle frank licht defeated chafee in his 1968 
bid for a third term as governor 
and licht who hasnt lost an election in his 13 years as a 
politician said he has no intention of starting now 
but chafee 64 who narrowly won a second senate term in 1982 
against former attorney general julius c michaelson with 51 
percent of the vote said he feels confident as the nov 8 election 
approaches 
you can never be totally sure as a candidate but you can tell 
some things and certainly i think the people appreciate what ive 
done for them over the years chafee said recently 
chafee the first rhode island republican to be elected to the 
senate is considered a moderate and there are few substantial 
issues separating the two men 
earlier this year chafee announced support for a national 
parental leave bill a measure backed by licht in the rhode island 
general assembly 
both of the candidates also support open space preservation 
chafee who has been endorsed by four major national environmental 
organizations said he would work to initiate a 10 billion federal 
open space program if reelected 
licht sponsored several bills last year that led to the states 
65 million openspace bond issue chafee has charged that the idea 
was first his 
as the election draws near the candidates have turned to 
attacks and the resulting barrage of television commercials has 
pushed their campaign spending to nearly 25 million each 
chafee ran a television ad asserting that when licht represented 
the east side of providence in the state senate from 1975 to 1984 
he missed one out of every three votes 
did he not care was he afraid to take a stand the ad asks 
or was he too busy doing something else 
licht in turn ran two ads that said he has had a 90 percent 
attendance record in the past six years he said he missed a number 
of votes in the early 1980s because of his fathers fatal illness 
and his own role in a lawsuit that overturned a controversial 1982 
redistricting plan 
another licht ad attacked chafee for his voting record on issues 
concerning senior citizens a familiar democratic tactic 
nationwide 
chafee voted 12 times to cut social security and five times to 
cut medicare said licht who has been endorsed by the national 
council of senior citizens 
polls continue to show chafee in the lead although licht has 
narrowed the gap slightly a poll taken in september gave chafee a 
lead of 30 percentage points over the democrat with 59 percent of 
the vote a poll taken in early october with the same 5 percentage 
point margin of error showed chafee with 54 percent of the vote 
while licht was the choice of 33 percent of the 400 people surveyed

in the modern age of presidential politics 
the democrats have a lot of experience being given up for dead 
generally its been a realistic enough presentiment but michael 
dukakis will surely look for inspiration to several remarkable 
party heroes 
harry truman and hubert humphrey are the mr octobers of their 
era it was probably truman foe thomas dewey whom republican 
frontrunner george bush was thinking about when he vowed over the 
weekend to go the extra mile this month and added im not 
going to mess up 
lloyd bentsen was using truman and kirk gibson as his weekend 
role models 
our party has a proud tradition of closing from behind said 
dukakis indefatigable running mate he told a farmers market in 
st louis i cant help but remember harry truman out there when 
the press had written him off 
humphrey came up short of course but his 1968 october comeback 
was still extraordinary following as it did a divisive primary 
campaign and a calamitous convention he sought to succeed an 
unpopular president lyndon johnson for whom the word albatross 
comes to mind 
but come back he did after finally staking out some 
independence from johnson humphrey put together a highenergy 
campaign in october and ended with 427 percent of the vote nearly 
scaring richard nixon out of his wits nixon ended with 434 
percent george wallace had 135 percent 
though a sitting president in 1948 truman didnt win nomination 
until well after midnight at which time convention managers 
released a flock of doves to celebrate the doves stifled by the 
heat promptly dropped dead on the convention floor prompting one 
party stalwart to reflect dead pigeons just like truman 
except the year didnt end with truman dead 
unpopular and far behind in the polls truman invented the 
whistlestop making an average of 10 speeches a day from the back 
of a train and sparing the republicans no ridicule in that blunt 
partisan give em hell manner of his dewey was no george bush 
he stayed above the fray on election day truman stood 
expectations on their head winning 495 percent of the vote to 
deweys 45 percent 
dukakis enjoys the same midoctober expectations as truman 
which is to say few outside his immediate family really believe 
hell win but there are differences between the two men and one 
is halftempted to look over at the cerebral and aloof dukakis and 
say governor youre no harry truman 
truman never had to say i think im a reasonably likable 
guy and if you asked him to name his heroes in american life 
can you imagine truman responding as did dukakis last thursday 
night some of them are in public life in the senate and the 
congress some of my fellow governors are real heroes to me 
his fellow governors 
truman like dukakis was not a commanding figure lots of 
people looked down upon him figuratively and literally 
at first the critics referred to my campaign tour as a 
oneman circus and called it less efficient and less dignified 
than the campaign being put on by the republicans truman said in 
his memoirs describing his comeback this way 
i simply told the people in my own language that they had 
better wake up to the fact that it was their fight if they did not 
get out and help me win this fight i emphasized the republicans 
would soon be giving the farmers and the workers the little end of 
the stick again 
the dukakis command huddled in boston and emerged to tell the 
washington post they would a la truman concentrate on economic 
themes in the lastditch drive for a miracle they mapped out an 
effort to concentrate on 18 states with 272 electoral votes 
that doesnt leave any margin for error it takes 270 electoral 
votes to win the white house and common sense says you cant win 
every state you contest unless youre ronald reagan and youre 
going to win them all anyway 
by sunday bentsen had merged his truman reminisces with a world 
series theme buoyed by the fact that the underdogs from los 
angeles had won a firstgame victory with the gimpy gibsons 
twoout homer in ninth 
were going to be like the dodgers last night he said it 
looked like they were down and out and all of a sudden they hit a 
home run and won it and i think we can do that in the next 24 
days 
of course this is bentsen talking not dukakis

when dan quayles campaign plane was late 
taking off one night last week a reporter suggested a reason for 
the delay quayle he said was up in the cockpit giving an 
interview to the pilot 
its the only person he hasnt talked to yet the reporter 
said 
when the new accessible dan quayle emerged last week the 
contrast with the old aloof quayle seemed dramatic to those 
who had studied him since he became the republican vice 
presidential nominee 
the old quayle was a wooden programmed speaker who avoided the 
media at every turn the new quayle has a conversational speaking 
style and is relentlessly available engaging protesters and 
showing up everywhere there is a camera microphone or notepad 
like a schoolboy given a reprieve from a final exam quayle now 
seems relaxed cheerful confident and as he put it a lot 
happier 
the indiana senators public break with the rigid control of his 
campaign by bush handlers and declaration that i am my own 
handler raised skeptical eyebrows among his press entourage 
the change still seems one more of style than substance quayle 
is still relegated to campaigning mostly in safe republican areas 
or small towns in swing states of his native midwest and he 
continues to echo positions already propounded by the campaign 
but after a week of scrutiny even the most dedicated skeptics 
were forced to observe that quayle did indeed seem to be a changed 
candidate 
those who have known quayle for years say his new style typifies 
him before he was lifted from relative obscurity to the intense 
spotlight of a national political campaign 
he is quick to challenge protesters who disrupt his speeches 
telling them you dont know my record and his speeches are 
often delivered from notecards rather than prepared texts often 
they are followed by a chatty questionandanswer session with the 
audience 
with close media scrutiny and the fallout from damaging 
questions about his military service academic record and personal 
life it simply took quayle time to decide that it was best to 
just be himself aides argue it is a theory quayle echoes 
i was just trying to feel my way through this national 
campaign and what the ground rules were and the expectations are 
and how best i can serve george bush and its just taken me a 
while he said now i know and now im off on my own 
quayle tackled his new role with relish in fact his enthusiasm 
for his selfstyled job of dr spin the man who interprets 
campaign developments for the press was such that a sign was 
posted at the entrance of the press section of the plane reading 
spin free zone but quayle came back anyway again and again 
hose bush strategists would be wringing their hands quayle told 
reporters one night as he perched on a the arm of a seat in the 
aircraft if they knew i was back here now 
quayle says the moment he knew he had to break away came two 
days after his debate with democrat lloyd bentsen when he learned 
of the anonymous sniping from bush staffers who viewed him as a 
liability to the ticket 
angry quayle telephoned bush campaign chairman james a baker 
iii then he went public saying he would take more control of his 
campaign aides denied that the whole episode was bakers latest 
ploy to prop up a weak candidate 
what appeared more likely was that baker and company had turned 
quayles dissatisfaction into a positive development campaign 
officials in fact seemed delighted at the media attention drawn by 
quayles metamorphosis into an incharge candidate 
quayle says that if the strategists didnt like what i was 
doing i suppose they could find a way to try to stop me 
but i think what is happening is that they trust my 
judgment and my judgment from a political point of view is good 
he said 
quayle denies suggestions of a rift between the two camps 
were all together were all pulling together for george 
bush 
the new strategy may be risky quayles campaign to date has 
been noteworthy for those few moments when he did strike out on his 
own to depart from a prepared text and ended up committing gaffes 
such as the time he told reporters i didnt live in this 
century 
but quayle seems philosophical about the dangers 
youre in a critical position no matter how you conduct 
yourself and i made a decision on the way im going to conduct 
myself and its going to be entirely different than i did the 
first weeks of the campaign he said 
in some respects you can say that its a higher wire that 
were walking on but it will help george bush and i am convinced 
of that he said thats my judgment and im very comfortable 
with it

democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis 
has been variously described as draconian and innovative in his 
fiscal policies as governor of massachusetts but the record 
suggests he met the bottom line in balancing nine state budgets 
through good times and bad 
criticism lingers about how dukakis turned a 360 million 
revenue shortfall into a 67 million surplus in the fiscal year 
that ended june 30 
and doubts remain about whether the current 116 billion budget 
dukakis 10th as governor will be in balance when fiscal 1989 
ends next june 
but even as those concerns leave the lips mostly of a small 
republican minority in the legislature and find their way onto the 
national scene in the rhetoric of dukakis presidential opponent 
vice president george bush nonpartisan experts continue to show 
confidence in the massachusetts economy and the governors 
management of state finances 
there arent many financial analysts that listen too closely 
to politicians weve been deceived too many times by them 
said bond analyst j anthony naylor senior vice president with the 
new york firm of rodman amp renshaw inc 
in a report this past week the new york bond rating service 
standard amp poors said it expects the state to continue to 
achieve sound financial results earlier this year sampp gave 
massachusetts its secondhighest bond rating aaplus marking the 
states first upgrading since 1984 
another major bond rating agency moodys investors service 
said last month when the commonwealth went to market with 250 
million in longterm bonds that the states budgets for both 
fiscal 1988 and fiscal 1989 have been balanced 
moodys which also upgraded massachusetts rating to its 
secondhighest level this year the first such increase since 1975 
noted that the state has little financial leeway in balancing 
fiscal 1989 
but it said indicators suggest that the underlying economy 
continues to be among the strongest in the country 
bush most recently in his thursday night debate with dukakis 
picked up on one small component of dukakis package for balancing 
the fiscal 1988 budget he accused dukakis of raiding the states 
pension fund reserves of 27 million dukakis denied it 
in fact dukakis tapped 27 million in pension funds he 
determined to be surplus after meeting immediate state obligations 
to the system of about 560 million in fiscal 1988 more than half 
the 27 million went to a teachers pension account and the rest to 
pay a general fund shortfall 
state gop executive director alexander tennant urged the house 
back into session last week contending the fiscal 1989 budget is 
as much as 1 billion out of balance 
tennant based his assumption on the slow rate of new revenue 
generated in the first fiscal quarter revenues for the period were 
up only 12 percent over a year ago while the state needs a 83 
percent annual rate to balance the budget but the first quarter 
results were affected by a 68 million payout in corporate 
abatements stemming from a tax break the legislature has now closed 
the dukakis administration contends revenues will rebound this 
year through a variety of new specialized tax increases such as 
levying the sales tax on cigarettes increased tax auditing 
practices and ending certain tax breaks 
richard manley president of the nonpartisan massachusetts 
taxpayers alliance is not so confident the foundation estimates a 
shortfall of 180 million to 220 million however manley said 
that is manageable if the administration demonstrates the same 
discipline it showed in fiscal 1988 
the budget problems the state faced in the past fiscal year 
resulted mainly from unexpected changes in taxpayer behavior due to 
federal tax law changes particularly affecting capital gains as a 
result final revenue growth for the year was 21 percent compared 
to a budget expectation of 66 percent 
dukakis was able to balance the books on fiscal 1988 principally 
through the largest planned reduction in spending ever attempted in 
massachusetts some 233 million was systematically trimmed 
primarily by delaying the start of new programs the policy caused 
disappointment among advocates but little reduction in existing 
services 
the administration also shifted about 185 million in 
construction projects scheduled to be paid from general funds to 
longterm bonds 
in the fiscal 1989 budget which dukakis proposed in january 
before all of the problems surfaced in fiscal 1988 he cut about 
200 million in new and expanded programs while the legislature was 
still debating the bill and vetoed or delayed spending over 200 
million more when he signed it into law 
he also won passage of several new revenue sources the 337 
million cigarette sales tax 75 million from income tax updating 
180 million from new tax enforcement and 40 million from 
corporate tax changes 
in 1975 dukakis inherited a deficit that slowly grew to 560 
million out of a budget of 38 billion it forced him to slash 
spending for general relief and state employee pay raises and 
finally to sign an income surtax the biggest broadbased tax in 
the states history the actions contributed to his defeat four 
years later and gave bush the basis to label him a taxraiser 
reentering the governors office in 1983 dukakis inherited 
another deficit projected to reach 300 million this time 
democratic legislators urged him to go for another big tax 
increase but instead he pushed for smaller spending cutbacks and a 
major crackdown on uncollected taxes the year ended with a 41 
million surplus

beijing has opened its first venereal disease 
treatment center to handle the rapid rise in vd cases the official 
china daily said today 
the report said the capital will grant 13500 to the western 
district venereal disease prevention and treatment center and plans 
to set up other district centers to combat the growing health 
problem 
it said 427 beijing residents last year were diagnosed as having 
gonorrhea syphilis and other types of vd 
vd is said to be most serious in southern guangdong province 
one of chinas most open areas bordering hong kong the province 
recorded 5600 cases last year triple the previous year 
venereal disease was a scourge of 20th century 
prerevolutionary china especially in the cities where 
prostitution and opium trafficking ran rampant 
after the communist takeover in 1949 chinese doctors launched a 
campaign to cure venereal disease placing prostitutes in 
reeducation camps and treating victims 
by the 1960s china claimed to have virtually wiped out the 
diseases but the problem returned in the 1980s with the nations 
opening to the outside world lack of education about the diseases 
and lax enforcement of the ban on prostitution are also blamed for 
the spread of vd 
the daily said the beijing center opened with an exhibition of 
pictures and videos focusing on the symptoms means of infection 
and harm caused by vd and on sex and family life about 100 
people mostly in their 20s and 30s visited the exhibition during 
its first two days

president reagan with little left on his 
agenda but to keep the white house in republican hands is 
relishing his highprofile role in george bushs campaign 
as he attends to the business of signing legislation passed by 
congress in its waning days reagan is continuing to stump for bush 
in key battleground states 
hell take his peaceandprosperity message into the heart 
of ohio this wednesday and will increase the campaign pace after 
congress adjourns possibly this week 
i think the presidents thriving hes enjoying himself he 
thinks hes making a difference white house chief of staff 
kenneth m duberstein said recently 
by all accounts reagans role in bushs bid for the white house 
has gone through an evolution in recent weeks the president has 
stepped up his appeal to the socalled reagan democrats in 
midwestern and northeastern states whereas it was once thought he 
would play a smaller role 
i was of the impression that they the bush campaign were 
going to say go carry california said democratic consultant 
robert keefe 
some inside both the bush campaign and the white house had said 
early on that reagans campaign activities would likely be focused 
on california his home state and on southern and sun belt states 
where reagan has been immensely popular even during his hard times 
one republican strategist discussing the changing campaign 
route on grounds of anonymity said it was decided that reagan 
should focus on the key battleground states where there are large 
numbers of ethnics conservative democrats and independents and so 
reagan has spent recent weeks in such places as illinois michigan 
pennsylvania and new jersey 
some of the places where the president is strongest have just 
solidified for bush much faster than we expected said this 
republican so the question became do you want to go to a state 
where youre 20 points up it obviously makes more sense to 
look at the other states that are close 
i think the role is just right said gop consultant eddie 
mahe youre sending your biggest guns into the biggest battles 
and theres no surrogate bigger than ronald reagan 
keefe the democrat acknowledged that the strategy of having 
reagan follow bush into states the vice president has visited 
recently has been helpful to the gop cause 
they have had a marvelous campaign where they have integrated 
the message themes very well he said 
besides making campaign appearances for his vice president 
reagan will likely put on a fullcourt press in california for 
example the president has used the trappings of his office to 
bushs benefit 
reagan frequently works a probush pitch into his official 
chores such as billsignings whenever he can connect the vice 
president to the situation at hand and throws probush statements 
into his weekly radio addresses 
perhaps reagans allout campaign for bush can be traced to 
conversations that both the president and duberstein had with 
former president richard m nixon 
nixon is known to believe that the lukewarm support given him by 
president dwight d eisenhower in 1960 contributed to his loss to 
democrat john f kennedy 
in an interview duberstein said that nixon and i spoke 
several months ago and i asked him to give his historical 
perspective what eisenhower did and didnt do for him and 
reagan entertained nixon for a private white house dinner 
the chief of staff said in an interview that because of these 
and other factors i think its fair to say that ronald reagan 
has campaigned for his vice president in an unprecedented manner 
keefe agreed with that 
what they have is an extremely commanding voice that can get 
himself heard any time he wants to day or night and its just 
awfully handy to have someone who can do that he said

fish farmers dont believe their crops are for 
the birds but try telling that to a hungry duck blackbird or 
heron 
birds are a costly problem where fish are cultured says 
researcher vickie d martin in a new agriculture department report 
waterfowl frequently blamed for heavy losses of fish at 
aquacultural facilities include diving ducks herons egrets 
terns gulls kingfishers blackbirds ospreys and anhingas 
these birds the diving ducks include grebes cormorants and 
mergansers were described as voracious fish eaters that not 
only cause property loss and damage but can transmit diseases to 
fish stock 
due to fecal contamination and the fact that some of the fish 
they consumed are diseased predatory birds may transmit diseases 
from pond to pond she said 
moreover when fish farmers attempt to guard against the 
airborne marauders they can be frustrated because a majority of 
the birds are legally categorized as migratory and are protected 
under federal and state laws 
martin a student at fort valley state college fort valley 
ga worked as an intern for the departments economic research 
service the last two summers 
although there are no figures documenting bird predation by fish 
species and location she said losses to birds have been reported 
on baitfish catfish shellfish tropical fish and trout and are 
greatest in the largest aquaculture states mississippi alabama 
arkansas california and georgia 
baitfish particularly minnows are lost to blackbirds in the 
winter cormorants in the fall and winter and herons in the 
summer martin said in the northeast herons prey on baitfish 
in the fall while trout are harassed by grackles kingfishers 
herons ospreys and occasionally owls during the spring late 
summer and early fall 
she added that diving ducks are the main bird threats to 
shellfish although swans occasionally are problems 
catfish in the southeast are preyed upon most by anhingas 
locally called water turkeys and kingfishers during the spring 
and summer months martin said herons and cormorants cause 
problems yearround crawfish and shrimp are prone to predation by 
purple grackles herons egrets ibises gulls diving ducks and 
kingfishers 
fish ponds can be protected somewhat by barriers such as 
perimeter fencing netting overhead wires and other devices 
including fireworks exploders and similar items used to frighten 
birds 
some chemicals such as avitrol a registered frightening 
agent for use on herring gulls and blackbirds have also been 
effective she said but state and federal permits are required to 
use this chemical on gulls because they are legally protected 
after ingesting the chemical the gull will behave erratically 
and emit distress calls which frighten away the other birds she 
said 
some migratory game birds may be shot during the hunting season 
and other permits are available for some species local state and 
federal wildlife authorities should be contacted 
still martin said some fish farmers believe birds are 
uncontrollable and that all frightening tactics are futile no 
matter what method of control of prevention is used

the agriculture department has decided to 
renew an advisory panel in hopes of outthinking or outmaneuvering 
some of the depredating animals that cause losses to farmers 
deputy secretary peter c myers said losses to farmers from 
blackbirds rodent and coyotes which were named as examples are 
estimated at more than 300 million a year and often represent 
the difference between profit and loss for many producers 
in recently announcing the renewal of the national animal damage 
control advisory committee myers said the panel serves as a public 
forum so that ranchers farmers and wildlife interests can have a 
voice in usda policies on animal control 
members of the committee include scientists farmers trade 
association representatives university and government people the 
chairman is assistant secretary kenneth a gilles who oversees 
usda marketing and inspection services

researchers say southern poultry farmers could 
save an estimated 7 million a year by using softer lowerpower 
lights in their broiler houses 
high summer heat makes chickens go off their feed so producers 
keep broiler houses lighted during the summer nights so the birds 
will eat during the cooler hours says james w deaton of the 
departments agricultural research service 
deaton said farmers traditionally use 75 or 100watt bulbs 
because they want to simulate actual daylight 
but our tests show that broiler chickens more than two weeks 
old eat normally and gain just as much weight under 25watt 
bulbs he said in a report released here by the agency 
deaton who works at the departments south central poultry 
research laboratory in mississippi said the annual savings could 
amount to 7 million across the south or about 1000 for a 
typical producer who raises about 160000 chickens during the 
summer 
the tests also showed that chickens under the dimmer lights 
waste less feed energy in fighting running around and 
chirping he said

few were as surprised as rep lynn martin when 
her sixyear fight to extend civil rights protection to house 
employees finally paid off 
six years wed been fighting for this sometimes youd feel 
like you were banging your head against the wall mrs martin 
said so i really didnt expect it to happen the way it did 
to the illinois republicans surprise members agreed 
overwhelmingly this month to end what she calls the ultimate 
irony their selfenacted exemption from the civil rights act of 
1964 
to impose a law as we did and then totally exempt oneself is 
a kind of hypocrisy that should not have continued this long 
mrs martin said the house recognized this finally its about 
time 
the chamber approved a compromise offered by rep leon panetta 
dcalif banning discrimination on the basis of race age sex 
religion handicap or national origin in the hiring and employment 
of house committee and staff employees 
the measure taking effect nov 3 also establishes an office of 
fair employment practices to hear discrimination complaints 
mediate disputes and penalize house members who violate the law 
mrs martin blamed the lack of progress until this year on 
resistance from a handful of old dons who run this place like 
they had their own little fiefdoms and dont want it to change 
thats probably true panetta said friday there are older 
members on both sides of the aisle who resisted ethics reform too 
when it happened a few years ago on the other hand theyve been 
around long enough to know changes are inevitable this one was 
the illinois lawmaker began her campaign for the civil rights 
legislation in 1982 when a study she requested found inequities 
between the salaries paid to male and female employees on capitol 
hill 
although she complained about the disparity to colleagues mrs 
martin said a followup survey in 1984 showed little change she 
introduced a bill in january 1985 to require congress and the 
federal judiciary to comply with the civil rights act the bill 
died in subcommittee 
last may after a third study found a continuing gap between pay 
for men and that received by women and minorities she submitted 
the bill again this time it bore the names of more than 100 
cosponsors 
the action finally approved oct 4 on a 40812 vote amends house 
rules to prohibit discrimination by members 
the exemption to the civil rights law still applies to the 
senate and the judiciary however lawmakers agreed under the 
compromise to consider mrs martins proposal again in june with an 
eye to creating a statute that would cover all congressional and 
judicial employees 
although 12 members voted against the measure aides said the 
votes did not necessarily mean they disagreed with its intent 
the boss went in planning to vote for it said larry 
vanhoose the administrative assistant to rep larry j hopkins 
rky his opposition was purely symbolic 
he is completely in sympathy with lynn martin he just didnt 
think the compromise went far enough because congress record 
isnt too impressive when it comes to regulating itself 
tish brink a spokeswoman for rep thomas d delay said the 
texas republican objected because he opposes regulation 
generally 
meanwhile mrs martin said she has started getting some 
fallout from members who voted for the change but have 
reservations about it 
for example an aide said one complained that eliminating the 
civil rights act exemption would force him to fire some female 
employees because he had more women on his staff than men 
that concern is unfounded mrs martin said 
im sure there is a down side to this somewhere she added 
ill get the blame for any problem theres no question about 
that but occasionally you do the right thing this one ive got 
no regrets on

the 100th congress plans to adjourn this week 
once it clears its desk of unfinished business including a 
campaignyear attack in the war on drugs 
the fate of dozens of bills lies in the balance as the house and 
senate begin what both sides agree will be the last week of the 
twoyear congress the biggest of the bills is a massive antidrug 
package passed by the senate last friday 
the senate bill isnt as tough on drug users as one passed 
earlier by the house and negotiators from both bodies will be 
meeting to try to resolve the differences if they agree on a 
single package a final vote will be needed in the house and in the 
senate before it can go to president reagan for enactment into law 
house and senate negotiators were bogged down on another major 
legislative package socalled technical corrections to a 1986 tax 
bill in addition to making technical corrections to that bill the 
proposal included selected new tax reductions the tax increases to 
pay for them and a bill of rights for taxpayers facing 
enforcement or collection action from the internal revenue service 
differences in the house and senate versions of the bill were so 
sharp that negotiations broke down friday and an aide to house 
negotiators said whether the conference gets back together at all 
again is very much up in the air 
on the other end of the priority list were bills ranging from 
legislation designed to assist individual people nominations of 
federal judges water projects affecting specific cities and states 
and a plan to end the united states trusteeship over the western 
pacific island nation of palau 
yet another bill that could make it under the wire would elevate 
the veterans administration to cabinetlevel status 
the fate of each of them was up in the air as members already 
in washington for a week or two longer than they had hoped strive 
toward an adjournment that will let them go home and campaign for 
reelection 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva told senators on 
friday that i certainly would hope we wouldnt have to stay 
beyond wednesday but nobody can predict that 
the house returns from a long weekend on tuesday with a 
scheduled vote on legislation that would require full disclosure of 
credit card information to consumers 
the bill passed by the senate last week requires that banks 
department stores and other companies that offer credit cards tell 
consumers about annual fees interest rates late fees and other 
information 
currently only a few states have laws requiring public 
disclosure of such information before consumers receive the cards 
rep fernand j st germain dri chairman of the house 
banking committee called the measure one of the most important 
and strongest credit disclosure acts that we have been able to move 
through the congress since the first truthinlending statute was 
passed 20 years ago 
also pending is legislation providing firstever restrictions on 
lobbying by former members of congress part of a general 
tightening of federal rules against influence peddling by top 
government officials 
the legislation has passed both houses of congress in different 
versions and a compromise will have to be worked out before it can 
win final approval and be sent to reagan 
the bill covers not only lobbying but any communication done 
for pay to influence government decisions including writing 
letters filing motions or granting requests 
it would prevent members of congress and senior staff members 
for one year after leaving office from contacting the legislative 
house in which they served the restrictions also would apply to 
lobbying for pay by anyone from the president and vice president on 
down through the top several thousand executivebranch policy 
makers

george bush can count on solid backing nov 8 
from the nations former spies who are making no secret of their 
support for the republican candidate 
this is 99 percent bush country said henry houkal a former 
cia official attending a twoday annual convention of the 
association of former intelligence officers over the weekend 
in the tightly knit intelligence community former spies feel a 
kinship with bush who served as the cias director for a year in 
1976 in the ford administration president jimmy carter dismissed 
bush after the democrats regained the white house 
the association does not formally take stands on political 
issues but it isnt difficult to determine most members 
allegiance 
james e treher a former fbi agent from pittsburgh who worked 
in counterintelligence said he feared that democrat michael 
dukakis if elected would put liberal restrictions on the cia 
he said that could result in the greatest disaster in 
intelligencegathering since the socalled church committee the 
congressional investigation that revealed the cia had tried to 
murder foreign leaders and destabilize governments 
bush found the cia reeling from the committees revelations 
the consensus among several exspies was that bush boosted the 
agencys morale in his short tenure by going along with the 
recommendations of the professional staff and interfering little in 
their work 
houkal that he was involved in a policy change and bush just 
signed off on it 
it was a tranquil operation added la shirito who now 
works for union carbide i am a bush admirer from those days 
despite his handsoff management style bush formed some close 
ties at the agency including one with donald gregg an excia man 
who has served as one of the vice presidents top foreign police 
advisers 
like others houkal said bush will probably leave the agency 
alone if he moves to the white house william webster a former 
fbi chief was appointed to head the agency after william casey 
president reagans friend died in may 1987 
one reason the former sleuths want to see republicans remain in 
control of the white house is their belief that intelligence 
agencies have prospered during the last eight years 
several present and former cia officials praised casey for 
beefing up the agency and improving its analytical capabilities 
robert m gates the cia deputy director said congress also has 
helped the agency by boosting its appropriations in the last 
decade congressional review of the intelligence process has 
given a growing number of members of congress an idea of what we 
really do for a living 
douglas george a cia analyst said he worked closely with casey 
on arms control issues and the former cia head never leaned on 
staffers to play with the facts so they jibed with policy views 
he kept his fingers off intelligence george said 
but helene boatner another cia analyst said casey had strong 
forceful views that may have prompted the analysts to selfcensor 
their product his personal views tended to have an impact she 
said 
she noted however there is always a tension between analysts 
and policymakers because the facts never fit squarely with the 
views of those who formulate policy the news from the analysts 
is usually bad she said 
boatner was critical though of bob woodwards book veil 
the secret wars of the cia 19811987 the book describes how 
casey and reagan committed the nation to new and expanded covert 
wars in central america and elsewhere 
i know things in the book that are true and i know things in 
the book that are dead wrong she said 
since the early 1980s the analysts said gathering and 
interpretation of information has improved the reagan 
administration has invested heavily in equipment to collect facts 
and in training analysts 
the nation had made a pretty spiffy investment in people 
george said 
among other things the cia has sought more experienced 
analysts expanded their training and tried to improve their work 
by giving them more time to travel and take sabbaticals 
they are a promising lot boatner said of the new breed of 
analysts 
gates said the agency is doing as well if not better than we 
ever have in recruiting with about 150000 inquiries a year the 
cia entertains about 1000 serious applications a month still the 
cia has problems recruiting specialists such as world class 
chemists and nuclear engineers 
john greaney afios executive director said 250 people 
attended the convention up from last year the association which 
has a membership of over 3000 is dedicated to promoting strong 
intelligence operations

a major study of libel laws today recommended 
sweeping changes designed to resolve disputes quickly through no 
fault trials deciding the truth of disputed statements 
no damages would be awarded in such trials 
the changes were proposed by the washingtonbased annenberg 
washington program of northwestern university in evanston ill 
after a study begun last winter by 11 lawyers judges journalists 
and others 
libel suits tend to drag on interminably are enormously 
costly for both sides and very seldom clearly resolve what ought to 
be the heart of the matter the truth or falsity of what was 
published said the report of the libel reform project 
a major change from current law in the proposal would be 
elimination of the requirement that public figures suing for libel 
prove that defamatory statements about them were published with 
actual malice that is with knowledge that they were false or 
with reckless disregard of whether they were false or not 
newton w minow director of the annenberg washington program 
summed up the advantages of the new procedures this way 
the plaintiffs in a nofault trial get a quicker verdict on 
whether they were defamed or not and if they win get their 
attorneys fees paid by the other side but they give up a shot at 
money damages 
the news media on the defense get relief from the chilling 
effects of huge emotionally based damage awards but they give up 
the times vs sullivan protections that have restricted libel 
rulings 
times vs sullivan was a 1964 case in which the us supreme 
court refused to award damages to a public official without a 
showing of malice 
as it stands now the present law is not adequately protecting 
the reputations of people who have been defamed and its not 
protecting journalists freedom to report vigorously and fairly 
the truth as they can best determine it minow said 
here are the main changes from current law incorporated in a 
model statute recommended to the states and federal government 
no suit for defamation could be filed unless the plaintiff had 
been refused a prompt retraction or chance to reply retractions or 
replies for candidates for office would have to be made before a 
coming election 
all such suits would have to charge that the defendant made a 
false factual statement that was defamatory tended to injure the 
plaintiffs reputation such a lawsuit could not be smuggled into 
court under another name such as invasion of privacy 
no one could sue over statements of opinion such as an 
editorial cartoon in determining what is fact courts could 
consider the extent to which a statement could be proved 
objectively and the extent to which exaggeration for rhetorical 
effect was intended 
most trials would be for declaratory judgment with the 
loser paying the legal costs of the winner such trials would have 
to begin within 120 days the only issue would be the truth 
according to the judgment of the jury or if the parties agree the 
judge 
a conventional trial for money damages could not be held unless 
both sides agreed and even then damages would be limited to the 
plaintiffs actual loss there could be no punitive damages 
however the loss might not be all financial a plaintiff could be 
compensated for humiliation for instance 
the plaintiff would have the burden of proof the duty to show 
by clear and convincing evidence that the disputed statement 
was false 
the mere repetition of statements about matters of public 
interest could not be the subject of a lawsuit if the originator 
were identified and there could be no inquiry into the state of 
mind of the defendant this would be a major change from current 
law which generally treats repetitions like original statements 
there would be no distinction between slander which is oral 
defamation and libel written defamation there would be no 
distinction between news media or other defendants 
the current exemption for statements made in official 
legislative judicial or administrative proceedings would be 
retained

this small bucolic nation hopes to change the 
television landscape in western europe with the launching of its 
astra satellite on dec 9 
an ariane rocket of the european space consortium is to send 
astra into orbit and if the project is successful millions of 
viewers will need only satellite dishes the size of an umbrella to 
receive tv broadcasts without paying for the service 
astra the project of luxembourgs societe europeenne des 
satellites will be the first one capable of beaming a package of 
16 channels directly to homes in the most densely populated areas 
of europe 
programming scheduled so far is to be financed through 
advertising revenues 
lowpower satellite signals now require big and expensive 
dishes these signals are primarily distributed by cable networks 
that charge the viewers limiting the audience 
but the mediumpower astra will beam channels directly to homes 
that will require only a dish costing about the same as a video 
recorder 
a mediumpower satellite was most suited to mass market tv 
and astra will be the first of its generation prime minister 
jacques santer said in an interview with the associated press 
in the early 1980s we realized much was happening in the 
audiovisual media he said 
at that time the broadcast monopolies of european governments 
began to fade with the advent of cable tv and the prospect of 
continentwide satellite broadcasts 
we took our chances to push through innovations santer said 
of the astra project all of europe is still virgin territory for 
television 
the luxembourg government initiated the astra project in 1983 
it has a 20 percent share in the societe europeenne des satellites 
which has 85 million in capital and has agreed to cover risks of 
up to 125 million 
eight of the 15 other shareholders are luxembourg companies and 
the satellites control center is in betzdorf 13 miles east of the 
capital 
santer hopes astra will generate income for the nation from new 
tv productions 
a satellite is only a transmission tool we must also produce 
programs thats the second important factor he said 
parliament is expected to enact a law soon giving tax breaks for 
audiovisual enterprises to set up shop in this nation surrounded by 
belgium france and west germany 
santer expects this will lure producers of situation comedies 
variety shows and other projects that are costefficient and carry 
relatively little commercial risk 
with astra and its related tv production initiatives luxembourg 
has its sights set on 1992 when the 12nation european economic 
community plans to forge a single european market for its 
industries 
the eec has estimated satellite television will generate 11 
billion in business for makers of reception dishes decoders other 
equipment and advertisers over the next five to seven years 
why can we not succeed where the americans were so 
successful said santer europe must put a greater effort into 
tv technology and programming 
despite such lofty european ideals astra is a usmade 
rca4000 satellite and the luxembourg company has signed its first 
contract for four channels with media tycoon rupert murdoch an 
american citizen 
through astra murdoch will target a market of over 80 million 
homes in western europe it will give areas not served by cable 
companies and limited to only a few national networks more choice 
astras key markets are britain west germany france austria 
switzerland northern italy denmark the netherlands belgium and 
luxembourg viewers in many other nations will be able to tune in 
but with a larger dish 
while many competitive satellite projects are still on the 
drawing board astra is to begin transmissions in early 1989 
the organization has signed a 10year contract with murdoch for 
his entertainment unit sky channel and movie sports and news 
channels 
us media magnate ted turner is negotiating for a channel 
sources said on condition of anonymity 
but too many englishspeaking programs would dent the european 
goal even though each one can be received in different languages 
according to santer 
we must diversify he said

with south african troops out of southern 
angola rebel leader jonas savimbi says his unita guerrillas face a 
tougher military struggle but have gained support in the united 
states and africa 
guerrilla officers promise few prolonged battles of the kind 
that unita and south african forces waged early this year in the 
siege of cuito cuanavale 
angolan government units were temporarily driven out of the 
southern town they say but eight months later unita is back in 
defensive positions east of cuito awaiting an enemy campaign 
the departure of several thousand south african soldiers seven 
weeks ago as part of regional peace negotiations has weakened 
our position savimbi said in a recent interview 
but he said the south african move has bolstered unitas 
credibility as an independent force and has increased diplomatic 
pressure on the angolan government to negotiate a settlement 
the declared goal of unita the national union for the total 
independence of angola is to force the ruling popular movement 
for the independence of angola into a powersharing arrangement 
leading to national elections 
savimbi expressed confidence that unita relying on traditional 
guerrilla advantages of speed and surprise can maintain the 
stalemate in angolas 13year civil war 
we cannot come out without wounds but we can sustain some 
wounds savimbi said 
for sure jamba will never fall savimbi said referring to 
unitas bush headquarters in southeastern angola they will pay 
such a heavy price i think they will not try 
unita says it has 37000 guerrillas and 28000 regular soldiers 
nearly half as many as the governments more heavily armed 80000 
soldiers and the 50000 cuban troops on its side 
negotiations involving angola cuba south africa and the united 
states are aimed at an agreement by nov 1 for a cuban withdrawal 
in return south africa would allow implementation of a united 
nations independence plan for southwest africa also known as 
namibia 
the marxist angolan government cannot stand alone without the 
cubans savimbi said during the interview at an unmapped forest 
supply camp near mavinga about 80 miles from forward unita 
positions 
african countries are giving much more sympathy since the 
south africans left savimbi said he named zambia togo 
morocco senegal nigeria kenya cameroon chad guinea mali 
egypt zaire and ivory coast as sympathetic to unitas cause 
he said liberal us democrats sens paul simon of illinois and 
christopher dodd of connecticut told him during a visit to the 
united states this year that the main barrier to their 
understanding was the direct involvement of south africa 
now we are working very well he said of the democrats 
brig peregrino chindondo unitas intelligence chief said 
guerrillas caused serious cuban casualties and burned eight cuban 
vehicles in a raid oct 6 on a convoy near the central highlands 
city of huambo he said 25 vehicles were seized oct 3 when unita 
took sanzo pombo in the northern uige province 
the morale of the enemy is very bad chindondo said most 
are recruited in roundup operations there is friction with the 
cubans they have lost the support of the people 
during an 11day tour of unita bases in southeastern angola 
where the movement effectively governs onethird of the country 
reporters visited a guerrilla command post 3 miles from enemy lines 
at cuito cuanavale there they talked with angolan prisoner of war 
julio wango 25 a few hours after he was captured in a skirmish 
wounds on wangos head and elbows were bandaged he was barefoot 
and unita officers said it was customary to remove prisoners boots 
so they could not escape 
wango said he had fled his village near ganda in benguela 
province to avoid military service but was caught by a government 
squad in a cornfield in march 
they beat me and told me i was a crook for trying to escape 
wango said they gave me three months training and made me a 
sergeant 
in the army we dont have any food no breakfast people are 
weak and fall while on duty wango said the only ones getting 
good food are cubans 
once i ran away to another brigade to trade beads for 
something to eat they found me and put me in confinement for five 
days

the slaughters of at least 450 wild horses 
have brought into focus a longrunning conflict between the 
mustangs and ranchers who both depend on the states rangeland for 
survival 
officials discovered the first mass slaughter in august when 41 
carcasses were spotted by helicopter near austin in central nevada 
since then other major finds include discovery of about 180 
carcasses on oct 89 
officials estimate that the horses had been shot between two 
years ago and early this summer 
what we have here is the kind of carnage that indicates an 
allout war against the wild horses bureau of land management 
spokesman bob stewart said last week 
blm officials refuse to comment on whether they have any 
suspects or leads 
delloyd satterthwaite president of the nevada cattlemens 
association acknowledged speculation that the gunmen were ranchers 
who have grown tired of the beautiful but destructive animals 
im as shocked as anyone about this satterthwaite said 
but its true ranchers dont like them the horse population 
is out of control and something has to be done or theyll ruin it 
for everybody 
ranchers consider the mustangs pests because they drink scarce 
water graze land used to fatten livestock and tear up fences but 
others consider the wild horse a last vestige of the old west 
champions of the horses also say they are the closest thing left 
in this country to pure mustangs the horses brought here in the 
1500s by spanish conquistadors foes say the animals have little or 
no such blood 
the 1971 wild and freeroaming horse and burro act sought to 
reconcile the interests of both sides the act declared the 
mustangs protected wards of the state and made their killing a 
misdemeanor punishable by up to a 2000 fine and one year in jail 
the law also allowed the blm to round up some horses for 
adoption or placement in sanctuaries to control the size of the 
wild herds and prevent overgrazing 
some ranchers say the control efforts have failed according to 
estimates the number of mustangs on the nations ranges has grown 
from about 17000 in 1971 to about 40000 now of which about 
28000 are in nevada alone 
when they passed that law they promised they would control 
the population satterthwaite said they didnt fulfill that 
commitment 
the situation may get worse before it improves last month the 
blm announced it was ending its free mass adoption program which 
waived a 125ahead adoption fee for anyone taking 100 or more 
horses 
animal rights activists had argued that the program allowed 
people to make a profit by selling adopted horses to 
slaughterhouses to be used for dog food glue or other commercial 
purposes 
the blm still allows people to adopt up to four horses a year 
for 125 each and is seeking to build sanctuaries that could serve 
as places for people to view the animals 
the wild horse may have some historical value to some people 
but it does not serve mankind like cattle or sheep satterthwaite 
said 
they should be treated like deer when the herd gets too 
large they have a hunting season on does im not saying kill the 
horses but control them

saudi arabia and its partners in the 
sixnation gulf cooperation council are ready to raise opecs 
overall production ceiling to try to stabilize prices according to 
a statement released today 
the move made public following a meeting of the councils oil 
ministers sunday appeared to defer to neighboring iraq in giving 
it the same quota as iran 
emerging from their 8yearold conflict both iran and iraq have 
said they will need to pump as much oil as they deem necessary to 
finance postwar reconstruction projects 
the council set one basic condition for the higher ceiling 
adherence by all opec members to any production levels agreed upon 
they also called for cooperation by oil producers outside the 
cartel 
the ministers of saudi arabia kuwait qatar bahrain oman and 
the united arab emirates called the meeting to try to forge a joint 
strategy to help opec prop up oil prices deteriorating due to a 
market glut 
the press statement carried by the official saudi press agency 
said the council members affirmed their quest to stabilize the 
world oil market on condition that this be the position of the 
other oil producers inside and outside opec 
it said the council states were ready to follow an overall 
production ceiling of 17429 million barrels per day for the 13 
members or any higher ceiling upon which agreement is reached 
within the organization 
the 17429 million barrel figure seemed to give iraq parity with 
irans quota of 236 million barrels per day the current ceiling 
for the 12 nations without iraq is 1506 million barrels per day 
iraqs quota under the 1986 agreement was 154 million barrels 
the statement did not clearly state that iraq was getting a higher 
quota and no one could be reached for clarification 
the statement also said any quota increase would be distributed 
in the same ratios as the current quotas 
members have been pumping at least 3 million barrels per day 
over the agreed on production ceiling the call to increase the 
ceiling appeared aimed at gaining some control over the market 
even if falling short of the 18per barrel price that the current 
ceiling was supposed to bring oil was trading at around 8 below 
that mark in recent weeks 
baghdad has ignored its limit and is producing at the rate of 
27 million barrels per day iran tried to produce above its quota 
but damage to its facilities during the war kept it pumping at its 
assigned level 
iraq has suggested it will cooperate with opec irans 
parliamentary speaker hashemi rafsanjani said friday that there 
was no reason to quarrel with the countries on the southern coast 
of the gulf over the oil market 
the united arab emirates also publicly renounced its quota 
producing 15 million barrels daily as opposed to the 948000 
barrels sanctioned by opec 
saudi arabia announced it would no longer cut production and 
sacrifice its revenue to defend prices it has overshot its quota 
of 43 million barrels per day in recent weeks to pressure the 
overproducers into respecting the quota system 
four of the six council members saudi arabia kuwait qatar 
and the united arab emirates are ranking members of the 13nation 
opec the two others oman and bahrain are not opec members but 
their economies depend on oil export revenues

president roh taewoo said today he 
will present a peace plan for the divided korean peninsula when he 
addresses the un general assembly on tuesday 
roh left today to address the united nations for the first time 
as a south korean head of state 
prior to his departure roh told a news conference he will 
unveil a new policy of unification between south and north korea 
and a northern policy aimed at improving relations with 
communist countries such as the soviet union and china 
seoul has been trying to improve relations with moscow beijing 
and other communist countries hoping that it would have a positive 
effect on reunfication efforts 
these communist countries have so far been allies of north 
korea although some of them such as the soviet union and hungary 
recently agreed to exchnage trade offices or permanent missions 
with seoul 
the capitalist south has no diplomatic ties with any communist 
country 
following the un address roh will fly to washington to lunch 
with president reagan on thursday those talks will also focuss on 
korean peace efforts seoul officials said 
south and north korea are not un members but the world body 
has decided to hear speeches from both north koreas first deputy 
minister of foreign affairs kang sok ju speaks wednesday 
the two koreas have been bitter enemies since their land was 
divided at the end of world war ii in 1945 they still are 
technically at war since no peace treaty was signed after the 
korean war in 195053 ended in an armistice 
the two korean states have held rapprochement talks on an off 
since the early 1970s but failed to make progress lawmakers of 
both sides began talks in august with little progress 
one senior government party official requesting anonymity said 
rohs speech may cover some sensitive matters including arms 
reductions by the two koreas which seoul officials have so far 
been reluctant to discuss openly 
in his latest peace proposal early this month roh renewed a 
call for summit talks with north korean president kim il sung and 
said he is ready to end rivalry and confrontation 
circumstances affecting unification have changed completely 
from the past roh said in a major policy speech two days after 
the seoul olympics ended oct 2 
the president said the olympics which attracted athletes from a 
record 160 countries including most communistbloc nations have 
enhanced south koreas stature in the international society and 
boosted chances for improved relations with north korea 
improved relations between east and west and the soviet union 
and china are also creating a favorable environment for seoul and 
pyongyang to thaw 40 years of icy relations he said 
roh said his government was drafting a new unification formula 
which he said should be practicable and acceptable to both 
sides 
observers in seoul think roh may drop hints at or even outline 
south koreas new unification formula 
not surprisingly rohs recent peace initiatives have received 
cool response from north korea which always prefers a quick 
lumpsum political settlement of issues to gradual stepbystep 
approaches being pushed by south korea 
but in what appeared to be somewhat encouraging development 
north korea conditionally welcomed rohs proposal for an 
interkorea summit according to seoul officials 
in its first official response to the proposed summit north 
korea said saturday it would welcome roh to visit pyongyang only 
after south korea has repealed its staunch anticommunist system 
and agreed to tackle political and military matters first 
one thorny issue is a north korean demand for withdrawal of the 
42000 us troops stationed in the south north korea maintains 
that no thaw in relations with south korea would be possible as 
long as the american troops remain

president corazon aquino urged the 
public today to await details before judging a new agreement on 
us military bases but lawmakers said the government had accepted 
too little money 
groups opposed to the presence of us troops branded the 
agreement a sellout and one senator said he hoped the 
agreement would respect a philippine ban on nuclear weapons in its 
territory 
another senator said an unsatisfactory agreement will speed up 
legislation requiring the aquino government to give washington 
notice it will close the six bases when their lease expires in 1991 
in washington on sunday foreign secretary raul manglapus said 
the united states has agreed to pay 481 million annually and back 
a bond program to help ease the countrys foreign debt as part of a 
lease agreement for the bases 
philippine sources said manglapus originally asked for 12 
billion over two years for use of the two largest us bases abroad 
clark air base and subic navy base and four smaller 
installations 
manglapus said mrs aquino gave him a go signal to sign the 
pact in washington today cash payments would be a big increase 
over the current 180 million in us military and economic aid 
attached to the bases but less than half that sought by the 
philippines when talks began in april 
mrs aquino was asked by reporters today whether she considered 
the talks successful 
why dont we just wait until all the details are laid out and 
expressed by secretary manglapus she said 
the leftwing peoples party denounced the agreement as a 
sellout and said manglapus should not have linked the 
continued presence of foreign troops to the debt issue 
party spokesman fidel agcaoili said the two issues should have 
been negotiated separately to strengthen the philippine bargaining 
stand 
sen ernesto maceda chairman of the senate defense committee 
said the reported agreement is a confirmation of the fact that it 
seems that this administration is not ready yet to stand up to 
washington 
maceda said the senate would be inclined to begin debate on 
a proposal filed months ago by majority leader sen orlando mercado 
to serve notice that the bases will be closed in 1991 
without such notification maceda said the bases agreement would 
be automatically renewed the new constitution requires that any 
extension beyond 1991 be approved by twothirds of the 23member 
senate where antibases sentiment is strong 
but rep gualberto lumauig a member of the house of 
representatives foreign relations committee termed the agreement 
welcome news because it would mean more money for the country 
as it tries to cope with a 28 billion foreign debt 
the manila stock exchange opened 454 points higher today than 
fridays close of 72552 traders said the increase was due in part 
to reports the united states and the philippines reached a bases 
agreement 
sen wigberto tanada a leading bases opponent said financial 
compensation was not the only issue 
i dont think it is enough to settle the issue of compensation 
if the threat of national destruction due to nuclear weapons and 
the derogation of national sovereignty is still there tanada 
said 
tanada was chief sponsor of a bill approved by the senate this 
year which would ban nuclear weapons from clark subic bay and the 
four smaller installations the legislation is pending in the house 
the agreement would cover only the final two years of the 1947 
military bases agreement which expires in 1991 mrs aquino has 
refused to say whether she will support extending the agreement 
which runs out one year before her term expires

columbus two years ago and decided to have their wedding at the

the government appears to be on a 
campaign to discredit the head of the roman catholic church in 
nicaragua cardinal miguel obando y bravo over the churchs use of 
us funds 
but the main issue seems to be the governments determination 
now that it feels it has defeated the usbacked rebels 
militarily to stop the flow of us funds to groups opposed to or 
not supportive of the leftist sandinista regime 
conservative estimates by political opposition sources in the 
capital managua say more than 50000 arrive from the united states 
monthly the sandinistas argue that most of the money comes from 
the central intelligence agency even if it is distributed by labor 
church or other groups 
on saturday president daniel ortega accused obando y bravo and 
nicaraguan bishops of becoming instruments of ronald reagans 
politics of death by accepting us funds 
at the center of the controversy with the catholic church is the 
role of the cardinal as one of the two members of the verification 
commission agreed upon by the sandinista government and the rebels 
known as contras 
the duty of the commission is to confirm that the two sides are 
following the peace accords tentatively approved earlier this year 
the other commission member is joao baena soares 
secretarygeneral of the organization of american states or oas 
the tentative peace accords specified that verification 
commission would be under the control of baena soares the oas 
would pay for expenses but to speed things up the us agency for 
1nternational development agreed to provide the 10 million needed 
managua curia spokesman monsignor bismark carballo explained 
that nearly 1 million of the funds would be used by the church to 
acquire equipment and pay salaries of members of local verification 
commissionss set up by the church in ceasefire areas 
the issue came to light a few days ago when the 
governmentcontrolled news media accused obando y bravo of trying 
to bring in dutyfree 17 fourwheel vehicles and a similar number 
of generators reportedly to be used by the local verification 
commissions 
assistant foreign minister victor hugo tinoco said there is 
nothing the local commissions can verify since there was no 
concrete agreement between the government and the contras 
what are they verifying tinoco asked last week adding the 
gpvernment does not recognize the cardinal as being in charge of 
the verification commission 
according to the original accords the commission would verify 
the movement of the contras into safe ceasefire areas withdrawal 
of sandinista troops and the eventual disarming of the rebels and 
their return to civilian life 
the talks broke down in june with both sides announcing 
unilateral ceasefires 
the local verification commissions were to be made up of the 
catholic bishops in the ceasefire areas and people they appointed 
as well as foreign representatives named by the oas 
secretarygeneral 
baena soares has remained quiet during the controversy and 
currently the commissions have only those members named by the 
church 
church officials say they feel the commissions are also charged 
with verification of respect for human rights and 
democratization in the ceasefire areas 
we know what they are doing tinoco said 
church officials acknowledge the commissions have gathered 
information harmful to the government 
tinoco said any funds for the verification commission may be 
suspended until the government and the commission reach an 
agreement on the way the commissions will work 
church officials said privately they feel the government may be 
trying to force obando y bravo to step down as a member of the 
verification commission 
the cardinal angered the government oct 9 when he publicly 
criticized it for rejecting humanitarian aid approved by the us 
congress

vice president george bush has portrayed boston as 
a hotbed of leftwing intellectuals who dont respect rituals like 
the pledge of allegiance but scholars say the pledge was born here 
whats more the baptist minister generally credited with 
composing it was a socialist 
most people dont know anything about the history of the 
pledge and if you tell them they dont want to believe you 
said louise harris of providence ri who has written two books 
on the subject 
the pledge of allegiance was surrounded by controversy and 
hucksterism after it first appeared in a boston magazine the 
youths companion on sept 8 1892 
the magazine had pioneered the sale of subscription 
premiums such as school uniforms and silver tea services but 
it achieved its greatest commercial success and its enduring 
legacy with a drive to put a flag in every school 
the flags were priced at 330 to 13 depending on size to 
help schools raise the money the magazine provided flag 
certificates that pupils could sell for 10 cents apiece 
the magazine urged schoolchildren to prepare to celebrate the 
400th anniversary of columbus voyage to america the next month 
and even published a suggested ceremony most involving a flag 
sandwiched between a presidential proclamation and an ode to 
columbus both long forgotten was the original pledge i pledge 
allegiance to my flag and to the republic for which it stands one 
nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all 
at the words my flag the students were instructed to 
stretch out their right arms to the flag similiar to the nazi 
salute 
it was not until 1923 that the words my flag were replaced 
by the flag of the united states of america out of concern that 
immigrant children might think they were pledging allegiance to 
their native lands 
thirtyone more years passed until under god was inserted at 
the the behest of president dwight d eisenhower who said that 
in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual 
weapons which forever will be our countrys most powerful resource 
in peace and war 
the original version of the pledge was unsigned but once it had 
caught on competing claims to authorship quickly emerged one 
group pushed for james b upham an editor of the youths 
companion the other favored the rev francis bellamy who had 
served as pastor of two boston churches before joining the 
magazines staff 
harris and some other scholars say upham was the author 
but two formal investigations by the us flag association in 
1939 and by the library of congress in 1957 concluded bellamy was 
responsible 
that is now the dominant view even though bellamy was a vice 
president of the society of christian socialists and once gave a 
lecture entitled jesus the socialist according to his 
daughterinlaw rachel bellamy of rochester ny he left the 
ministry because he felt the church wasnt doing enough to help 
the working man 
the nationalist movement which he belonged to wanted to 
nationalize chunks of the american economy but have them controlled 
at the municipal level said researcher david whitman of 
washington dc he did not practice or preach violent overthrow 
of the government by any means 
controversy over the pledge erupted during the 1988 presidential 
elections when bush criticized his democratic rival gov michael 
dukakis for vetoing a 1977 bill that would have mandated that 
teachers lead the students in the pledge the beginning of every 
school day 
that wasnt the first controversy surrounding the pledge in the 
1940s jehovahs witnesses objected to reciting it in schools 
saying it violated their religious principles of pronouncing 
allegiance only to god 
the us supreme court initially rejected their arguments 
ruling in a 1940 case that public schools could expel children who 
did not recite the pledge then in 1943 the court reversed itself 
and said children could not be compelled to pledge 
meantime jehovahs witnesses had been the targets of attacks in 
dozens of communities in richwood va for example members of 
the sheriffs department and american legion forced seven members 
to drink large quantities of castor oil then tied them together 
and paraded them through town 
bellamy was an avid fan of saying the pledge said whitman 
but i cant imagine how he would have felt about it if he had 
lived to see the mob violence of the 40s

a man wanted in california for 
allegedly carrying out a string of sex slayings wont be returning 
to the united states soon even though he faces extradition 
proceedings his lawyer has predicted 
hearings will begin today to determine whether charles ng 
currently serving a 4year jail sentence here for armed robbery 
should be extradited to the united states 
but ngs calgarybased lawyer don macleod said it could be a 
long time before his 27yearold client heads south if ng loses 
the case there will likely be an appeal he said 
ng was convicted in canada in december 1985 after a botched 
shoplifting attempt in calgary in which a security guard was shot 
in the hand 
but the united states wants ng back to face 25 felony counts in 
calfornia including the murders of 12 people eleven of the deaths 
involved grisly sex slayings at a rural cabin in calaveras county 
120 miles east of san francisco 
the other murder case involves the death of a san francisco disc 
jockey and other charges include burglary kidnapping and false 
imprisonment 
ng a native of hong kong and a former marine came to canada 
after his companion leonard lake was picked up for shoplifting in 
san francisco and committed suicide 
lake later was linked to the deaths or disappearances of 22 
people that investigation led to the charges against ng 
 
if extradited and convicted ng faces possible execution in 
california 
canada has a policy against extraditing anyone facing the death 
penalty but the final decision will ultimately rest with federal 
justice minister ray hnatyshyn 
the hearings which are being held to determine if there is 
enough evidence to send ng back to the united states are expected 
to last up to five weeks 
not all evidence will be available to the public madame justice 
marguerite trussler of albertas court of queens bench ordered in 
may that anything said in open court could be reported but the 
courtroom would be cleared when certain sensitive material was 
discussed 
among observers at the hearings will be some family members of 
ngs alleged victims who were given financial aid by the 
edmontonbased victims of violence for their trip 
sharon sellitto whose 39yearold brother paul cosner is one of 
ngs alleged victims said she wanted to see the accused killer for 
herself 
i want to hate him in person sellitto said recently from 
her san francisco home she plans to attend the hearings 
allegations of torture and mass murder in the california deaths 
have caused many to question canadas extradition procedure as 
recently as may california gov george deukmejian urged prime 
minister brian mulroney to speed up the process 
in a letter deukmejian said denying the extradition could 
have the unfortunate consequence of making canada a haven for death 
penalty fugitives 
but ngs calgarybased lawyer don macleod predicted it could 
be a long time before ng heads south regardless of the outcome of 
the extradition hearings he said there will likely be an appeal

chinas senior leader deng xiaoping said today he 
wrote a letter to soviet president mikhail gorbachev three years 
ago and that the letter was now bearing fruit 
deng revealed at the beginning of a meeting with romanian 
president nicolae ceausescu that he had entrusted ceausescu with 
the letter apparently calling for an improvement in sinosoviet 
relations 
you can see the letter you carried three years ago has 
achieved results deng said to the romanian president as they 
posed for photographers its happening later than we thought 
but dont worry 
deng also repeated his prediction made in talks with finnish 
president mauno koivisto last week that it is possible that next 
year there could be a summit 
it would be the first summit between the two countries in 30 
years 
chinas foreign minister qian qichen is to travel to moscow 
later this year to discuss details of the first summit since nikita 
khrushchev visited beijing in 1959 
the first foreign minister workinglevel talks since 1956 are 
expected to focus on the cambodian question the last major 
stumbling block to normalizing relations strained by an ideological 
split in 1960 
china has demanded that moscow use its influence to force 
vietnam to withdraw its troops from cambodia the soviet union is 
vietnams main financial backer and arms supplier 
ceausescu who last met deng in october 1985 said it doesnt 
matter that the rapprochement process between moscow and beijing 
has been slow history is long and the route we are taking is 
long 
china has insisted that deng and not the soviets first 
suggested the holding of a summit although gorbachev has grabbed 
the initiative in recent years by saying he was ready to meet 
chinese leaders without any preconditions 
ceausescu told deng he had visited moscow the previous week 
and now i convey greetings to you from gorbachev 
deng replied you can also convey my greetings to gorbachev 
romanias position as a independent maverick among the warsaw 
pact has contributed to ceausescus acting as an intermediary 
between disputing nations romania was the only sovietbloc country 
to maintain normal political and partytoparty ties with china 
after the split between moscow and beijing 
he is currently making his sixth visit to china

the mcmartin preschool molestation case was 
billed as the nations largest when it was launched five years ago 
with seven defendants and 41 alleged young victims 
now the shrunken case is remarkable for its longevity and the 
bitterness it has left among those who have been touched by it 
the only remaining defendants are raymond buckey 30 and his 
mother peggy mcmartin buckey 61 who taught at the now defunct 
manhattan beach preschool founded by mrs buckeys mother virginia 
mcmartin 
the buckeys face 65 charges of molestation and conspiracy down 
from an original 115 counts the alleged victims have dwindled to 
11 
the trial has consumed 1 years and wont end for months the 
defense which has called buckey an american hero victimized by 
the news media and claimed children were coached into alleging 
molestation begins presenting its case this week the trial 
followed a preliminary hearing that lasted nearly two years 
the case has poisoned everyone who had contact with it 
superior court judge william pounders declared last week 
by that i mean every witness every litigant and every 
judicial officer its a very upsetting case 
two witnesses have died one by suicide the other from an 
alcoholrelated disease pounders has attributed both deaths to 
pressures of the case 
we never envisioned that it would last this long said 
robert philibosian the former los angeles district attorney who 
filed the case 
its absolutely a travesty of justice for the children and 
parents that the case would last this long 
he blames a california law giving a defendant the right to a 
postindictment preliminary hearing and a municipal court judge 
who he said didnt limit that pretrial proceeding 
philibosian also criticizes his successor district attorney ira 
reiner for waiting until the end of the preliminary hearing in 
1986 to dismiss charges against five former teachers 
reiner who had said evidence against the five was incredibly 
weak has declined to discuss the case until the trial is over 
the chief prosecutor deputy district attorney lael rubin says 
the trial has been worth the effort and its 105 million cost she 
said the testimony of nine children who took the stand and medical 
evidence showing significant genital scarring in seven of those 
children helped her case 
i can think of many other things i might rather have done over 
the last 4 years but you have to have a more global perspective 
if nothing else the public is now more aware that these kinds of 
things have occurred and unfortunately continue to occur she 
said 
buckeys attorney danny davis says his client is an american 
hero who has endured a media blitz that declared him guilty 
the case was lost when i was hired said davis if i read 
the newspapers and didnt know ray buckey wouldnt i have thought 
he was guilty 
buckey who was 25 at his arrest has been held without bail and 
marked his 30th birthday in jail his mother free on bail reports 
to court every day usually clutching her knitting and a bible 
the childrens allegations included teachers touching their 
genitals urinating on them and forcing them to have sex with 
animals rabbits were mutiliated to scare the youngsters into 
remaining silent the children said 
the defense which has contended that the children were coached 
or coerced by a social worker or their parents to allege 
molestation has managed to whittle down the case 
last week the judge agreed to a prosecution request to drop 27 
charges based on claims of abuse by three alleged victims who 
failed to testify the prosecution claimed they were too 
traumatized to appear in court the defense said they were 
deliberately excluded because their planned testimony lacked 
credibility 
davis expresses confidence his client will be cleared 
the message for ray buckey is big men come out of big 
mistakes and this case is a big mistake he said

small planes are flying tons of food to 
thousands of starving civil war refugees but relief officials say 
fighting and flooding will keep help from reaching hundreds of 
thousands in remote areas 
twinengine cessnas on sunday flew some of the 90 tons of food 
to about 40000 people jammed into abyei 500 miles southwest of 
the capital khartoum the 1 million usfinanced airlift began 
thursday and is to last 10 days 
brian wannop a representative of the un development program 
in khartoum said officials visiting abyei in the past few days 
said the emaciated southerners were too weak to prevent scavenging 
hyenas from dragging away the bodies of relatives at night 
the refugees left behind their crops and cattle to escape a 
civil war between the government and the sudan peoples liberation 
army fighting for economic and political reform since 1983 and 
claiming to control 90 percent of the southern countryside 
the group demanding autonomy for the christian and animist 
african south from the moslemdominated government in the north 
has shot down relief planes because they say the flights may be 
militaryrelated abyei is just beyond the reach of the fighting 
western relief officials say the airlift to abyei is tiny 
compared to the extent of devastation facing hundreds of thousands 
of others in less accessible areas 
wannop said that in the past five years of the civil war about 
2 million southerners fled their homes to camps and shantytowns in 
southeastern ethiopia central and western sudan and around the 
capital of khartoum he said 150000 people fled to the western 
region of darfur and south kordofan where abyei is located 
a western relief official said it would take two to three weeks 
before the impact of the supply mission could be felt the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity said eight to 10 
people weakened by malnutrition lack of medical treatment and a 
long trek to refugee camps were dying every day 
an estimated 80 people a day died in the areas refugee camps in 
july and august the worst months in a summer that some relief 
officials say took up to 10000 lives they said most were the 
elderly or young children 
wannop said a possible explanation for the lower death rate was 
that all the younger children had already died during the difficult 
summer months 
the sudanese red crescent says abyeis population of 10000 has 
swelled to 40000 by displaced people 
sudanese officials say the western agencies are exaggerating the 
number of refugees throughout the south and that the government has 
drawn up a plan to supply relief to about 224000 people 
the people affected by the famine and starvation are moving 
northward said haj tayeb sudans acting commissioner for relief 
and rehabilitation we reached some of them and gave them aid 
the government earlier expelled several western relief agencies 
for allegedly working with the rebels to get supplies to stranded 
southerners 
heavy rains and floods in august have exacerbated conditions for 
the southerners and hampered efforts by sudanese and foreign relief 
agencies to help them 
relief food and medicines last reached abyei in june before 
prime minister sadek mahdis government halted relief operations 
during the rainy season when the guerrilla war intensified 
rebel gunners shot down two relief planes in 1986 and 1987 
killing more than 70 people

an art dealer imprisoned for tax evasion was 
cleared of charges that he humiliated and tortured a teacher for 
six hours during a sadomasochistic homosexual encounter 
the state jury acquitted andrew crispo of kidnapping sodomy 
assault and coercion because members believed the teacher had 
agreed to the ordeal said juror ara derderian 
the jury which reached its verdict on the sixth day of 
deliberations sunday deadlocked on a charge of unlawful 
imprisonment the district attorneys office was considering 
dropping the charge 
crispo 43 had denied the charges by mark leslie a 28yearold 
college english teacher from montreal who said crispo and four 
young men imprisoned and brutalized him in crispos manhattan 
gallery on sept 20 1984 
defense lawyer robert kasanof called the verdict protection 
for everybodys liberty 
he noted that leslie met crispo admitted he liked getting hit 
and feeling a little pain during sex and paid the check when he 
went out to dinner with crispo after the encounter 
assistant district attorney joel seidemann who described crispo 
during the trial as a master manipulator who deals art by day 
and torture by night said simply the jury has spoken 
leslie who fled to vancouver british columbia after montreal 
newspapers published his name address and photograph denounced 
the verdict in a statement 
my purpose in bringing this charge was to prevent andrew 
crispo from beating torturing or killing other young men the 
statement said justice jeffrey atlas rulings throughout the 
trial and the subtle bias of his charge to the jury make a 
profoundly disturbing statement in our society it is acceptable to 
brutalize and even murder gay men 
leslie testified at the trial but was not present for atlas 
instructions to the jury 
he had testified that he had two sadomasochistic encounters with 
crispo and snorted cocaine with him at the second encounter 
leslie said he was attacked at the gallery against his wishes and 
left bleeding crying and handcuffed he said he expected some 
rough sex but did not consent to being tortured 
leslie did not protect himself by saying theres a limit to 
what im willing to do said derderian a 60yearold architect 
who was the only juror to talk to reporters after the verdict 
there was a mistaken idea of what each side meant by domination 
a key prosecution witness was bernard legeros 26 who pleaded 
guilty to attempted kidnapping in exchange for his testimony 
against crispo 
legeros is serving 25 years to life for the sadomasochistic 
murder in february 1985 of eigil dag vesti 26 a norwegian fashion 
student and model crispo was implicated but never charged in 
vestis death 
vestis body was found on the estate of legeros parents after 
seeing news naming legeros and crispo leslie went to the police 
crispo has served 2 years of a fiveyear federal prison 
sentence for tax evasion and is eligible for parole according to 
his attorney mary shannon

the plane crash that killed president 
mohammed zia ulhaq the us ambassador and 28 others was not an 
accident according to a uspakistani report but officials said 
the exact cause may never be known 
pakistan air force cmdr abbas mirza who released a summary of 
the report sunday said the aug 17 crash of the hercules c130 
transport plane may have been caused by a small explosion or the 
pilots may have been drugged or intentionally crashed the plane 
but the lack of a black box voice recorder and the inability to 
perform autopsies on the bodies of the pilots is hampering 
investigators from concluding just what caused the plane to go 
down he said 
the 365page report ruled out mechanical failure said mirza 
who gave a 27page summary to reporters at a hastily called news 
conference 
after a thorough analysis of the available evidence the board 
has been unable to substantiate a technical reason for the 
accident said the report by four pakistani investigators and six 
us air force officers 
in the absence of the technical reason the only other 
possible cause of the accident is the occurrence of a criminal act 
or sabotage leading to the loss of aircraft control and the 
crash it said 
in washington us state department spokeswoman nancy beck said 
us officials received a copy of the report and we are studying 
it she made no further comment 
all 30 people aboard the plane were killed including us 
ambassador arnold raphel a us defense adviser brig gen 
herbert m wassom and five top pakistani generals 
mirza said eyewitness reports and a test of debris ruled out the 
possibility the plane was hit by a surfacetoair missile or 
suffered a powerful midair explosion but he said a smaller 
explosion remained a possibility 
he said witnesses reported the aircraft pitched violently for 
about two minutes before making a nosedive 
mirza also said lab tests of the debris showed unusually large 
quantities of chemicals used to make explosives including 
phosphorus chlorine potassium antimony and pentaerythritol 
tetranitrate 
he said investigators assembled a detonator from the same 
chemicals found in the debris 
the report noted phosphorus was found on mango seeds in the 
wreckage earlier reports speculated an explosive device was hidden 
in a box of mangos offered as a gift and placed aboard at the last 
minute mirza did not comment on the theory 
among the scenarios mirza suggested were that the flight crew 
was drugged causing them to lose control but he said that due to 
the condition of the bodies no autopsies could be performed to test 
that theory 
the drugs could have been hidden in a gift package or beverage 
cans mirza said 
mirza said the phrase criminal act referred to the 
possibility that the pilot or copilot could have disrupted cockpit 
controls intentionally causing the crash in an open field 
because there was no voice recorder aboard the aircraft he 
said it was impossible to determine what the crew said before the 
crash 
the plane originated in islamabad and flew to bahawalpur where 
zia watched a demonstration of the us m1 abrams battle tank the 
fourengine turboprop crashed after takeoff on the return flight 
from bahawalpur 330 miles south of islamabad 
zia 64 was a military strongman who imposed eight years of 
martial law during his 11 years in power 
the soviet union and afghanistan objected to his support of 
rebels fighting afghanistans marxist government 
india fought three wars with pakistan since the subcontinent was 
partitioned in 1947 
pakistan is committed to holding elections nov 16 for a new 
leadership

tibet is troubled by a small independence movement and tension 
between chinese and the local tibetans while there have been 
reports of labor unrest in liaoning northeast china

chinese security officials acknowledge is a rising problem with 
crime and social unrest resulting from the states gradual 
loosening of political and economic controls 
in the past few years there have been riots in tibet student 
demonstrations calling for greater democracy labor strikes and 
protests by farmers about pollution 
jingan official yin guishan said the cost of providing a riot

unseasonably heavy rains flooded much of 
western washington forced about 45 people to be evacuated from 
homes and campgrounds and stranded two hikers shivering under a 
tree for a night 
we had just about lost hope we thought we were going to die 
out there said steve winsel 28 of fairfield calif who was 
hiking with his 30yearold brother mike of everett 
rain tapered off and floodwaters were receding late sunday in 
the cascade mountains foothills east of seattle but more rain was 
predicted for tonight and early tuesday with the approach of 
another storm system the national weather service said 
the winsels were trapped in the vesper peak area about 20 miles 
south of sultan a town of 1500 residents 30 miles northeast of 
seattle the brothers were dressed in boots and jackets and had 
some food but said it was icy cold and only one of them had gloves 
we were awake all night shivering steve winsel said in 
the morning we tried to return on the logging road but we found 
the skykomish river had risen overnight and had wiped out the 
road in three places 
the only bridge they found was impassable so the brothers had 
to swim across the river where they were picked up by a truck 
driver and taken back to sultan 
we probably wouldnt have been able to survive if wed have 
stayed outdoors another night steve winsel said 
wed already spent 24 hours in hell 
the skykomish crested in sultan on sunday three feet above flood 
stage fire chief roger knowlton said 
about 15 residents had to be evacuated by boat from the town 
sunday morning according to karl christian a dispatch supervisor 
for the snohomish county sheriffs office residents were allowed 
to return home sunday night

housing after evacuating them from trailers in the snoqualmie river 
campground on sunday said relief worker hope tuttle the contents 
of two or three trailers were believed destroyed she said 
the skagit and stillaguamish rivers also reached flood stage at 
upper elevations sunday the weather service reported a flood 
warning for the nooksack river was canceled late sunday 
the floodwaters closed numerous roads throughout the cascade 
foothills no damage estimate was immediately available 
heavy rain washed enough logging debris down the skagit river to 
cause a partial dam to form at a burlington northern railroad 
bridge but no major problems were anticipated said tom sheahan 
management director of the skagit county department of emergency 
services 
during the 48 hours ending at 5 pm sunday the weather service 
reported 164 inches of rain in bellingham 139 in olympia 104

doctors said they kept a dead mans heart 
beating for an hour in a successful test of a drug designed to 
prevent blood clots but an ethicist is questioning the 
experiments technique 
it raises such fundamental issues that it needs to be explored 
before you can call it right or wrong said ethicist and 
physician dr john la puma of lutheran general hospital park 
ridge ill la pumas editorial accompanies the medical report in 
the current issue of the annals of internal medicine published in 
philadelphia 
researchers at the state university of new york at stony brook 
and centocor a malvernbased pharmaceutical company said the test 
successfully prevented the mans blood from clotting during the 
hourlong experiment 
the drug called 7e3 also did not cause excessive bleeding one 
possible side effect of two commonly used anticlotting drugs 
heparin and warfarin 
researchers used a portion of a singlecell antibody to block 
the clotting such antibodies are often called a magic bullet 
because they seek out a specific cell 
blood clots can cause strokes or heart attacks such as when 
they travel to the brain or pulmonary arteries 
the experiment was conducted on a 78yearold man at the stony 
brook hospital by researchers led by barry coller a hematologist 
at the university on new yorks long island 
relatives of the man who had been in a coma from a brain 
hemorrhage and the hospitals institutional review board gave 
permission for the test the man had been placed on a respirator so 
that his heart would continue beating during the experiment 
the article did not say when the experiment was conducted 
the advent of a specific treatment such as the antibody 
without causing side effects would be a very welcome and important 
addition to available therapies dr hamid almondhiry a 
hematologist at the penn state milton s hersey medical center and 
a researcher in anticlotting agents said in a telephone interview 
in his editorial la puma wrote that the experiment was 
ethically questionable and added that the report did not 
outline details regarding informed consent that he considers 
essential he noted the researchers received consent from the 
hospital and were not the ones to contact the patients physician 
to ask for consent 
the newly dead should be considered for such experiments only 
when the work is of value to physicians treating patients rather 
than basic biological research said la puma 
la puma said he found three reported instances of scientists 
experimenting on newly dead patients this century 
coller said using a newly dead patient allowed the investigators 
to study the effects of several doses of the treatment using live 
volunteers would have increased the time necessary to complete the 
study he said 
in our setting the experiment provided us important 
information that was potentially useful in benefiting humans 
without exposing a living human to harm coller said in a 
statement 
the experiment will also provide data for prospective volunteers 
in clinical studies the article said 
coller said the patients physician notified the researchers 
that the patient could be eligible for the study 
coller said nine years of prior research at stony brook 
massachusetts general hospital and the university of wisconsin had 
shown that the agent 7e3 prevented blood from clotting in test 
tubes monkeys and dogs and models designed to simulate impending 
strokes and heart attacks in humans

progovernment newspapers 
today hailed president pw bothas trip to europe and the ivory 
coast as a rousing success although no agreements were announced 
and botha declined to divulge details 
botha returned sunday following a 10day trip the latest in a 
series of foreign journeys aimed at easing the countrys diplomatic 
isolation 
botha attended the funeral of bavarian governor franz josef 
strauss in west germany then went to switzerland where he met with 
bankers and businessmen 
en route back to south africa botha stopped briefly saturday in 
portugal and the ivory coast in portugal botha met with prime 
minister anibal cavaco silva and in the ivory coast with president 
felix houphouetboigny 
according to the french news agency agence francepresse botha 
made a brief statement in the ivory coast saying his conversations 
with houphouet covered african problems in general and southern 
africa in particular but he did not elaborate 
it is always a privilege to meet him botha said of 
houphouet according to the afp report we didnt want to pass by 
without stopping in this country of goodwill 
none of the officials who met botha have issued public 
statements regarding the talks 
the ivory coast stopover marked bothas fourth visit to a 
blackruled african country since midseptember botha declined to 
discuss the specifics of his talks with houphouetboigny one of 
africas longestserving leaders 
we discussed matters concerning africa and especially southern 
africa we decided not to make statements botha said 
the citizen a progovernment newspaper said bothas recent 
travels have focused world attention onto south africa 
at a time when one might have expected the world to 
demonstrate an obsession with the american presidential election 
the spotlight has instead been turned on south africa the 
newspaper said today in an editorial 
the afrikaanslanguage daily beeld said what clearly began as 
a visit to pay homage to a dead friend strauss turned into a 
noteworthy trip perhaps these moves could be followed up by 
one or two dramatic developments internally that will show the 
world that we are earnest about reform 
the newspaper suggested the government could release jailed 
african national congress leader nelson mandela and scrap pending 
legislation designed to strengthen the group areas act which 
segregates neighborhoods by race 
the governmentrun south african broadcasting corp said bothas 
travels herald a fundamental change in south africas 
relationship with the rest of the continent 
by the end of last week even the most hardened cynics were 
having to concede that a new spirit of conciliation was abroad 
the sabc said 
botha who has held power since 1978 never held a summit 
meeting in a blackruled african nation until he traveled to 
mozambique last month he also has visited malawi and zaire in 
recent weeks 
south africa says presidents joaquim chissano of mozambique and 
mobutu sese seko of zaire are likely to visit south africa in 
coming months 
the citizen quoting unidentified government officials said 
there was a possibility that botha would meet with angolan 
president eduardo dos santos 
south africa in august withdrew its troops from angola where 
they fought alongside the antimarxist unita rebels 
south africa and angola along with cuba and us mediators 
have been attempting to negotiate an agreement on the withdrawal of 
50000 cuban troops supporting the angolan government and 
independence for southwest africa the territory ruled by south 
africa

foreigners captured after entering 
afghanistan with moslem guerrillas have been caught up in the kabul 
governments effort to win international credibility 
as the soviet unions troops withdraw after nine years of 
helping the afghan government fight the guerrillas the quest for 
peace is increasingly pursued on the political front as well as the 
military one 
winning recognition as a legitimate government is a key part of 
the political campaign two turks who joined the afghan guerrillas 
and a west german doctor and nurse who were working in a 
guerrillacontrolled area are the latest pawns in this game all 
four are being held in kabuls polecharki prison 
most western nations have refused to recognize or deal with the 
afghan government since moscows 1979 intervention that sent more 
than 100000 red army troops into afghanistan to bolster the 
sovietstyle regime 
afghan officials have made it clear the turks prison terms 
could be shortened if president turgut ozal of turkey appeals to 
president najib for clemency according to a diplomatic source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity the turkish government has refused 
to do so on the grounds that humanitarian issues should not be 
mixed with politics 
appeals addressed to najib by president francois mitterrand of 
france and president francesco cossiga of italy resulted in the 
freedom of a french journalist and an italian photojournalist 4 
months ago the two men had been convicted of espionage and of 
entering afghanistan illegally 
france and italy were criticized by some of their western allies 
on the grounds the appeals constituted de facto recognition of the 
afghan government 
the turkish and west german prisoners were accused of entering 
afghanistan illegally from pakistan they four have been visited in 
prison by representatives of their governments 
one of the turks turgut uzel 22 was captured in 1984 and is 
serving a 16year sentence the other osman demir 24 was 
captured in december 1987 and is serving a 20year term both were 
convicted of illegal entry and espionage 
west german doctor benno splieth and nurse lea hackstedt were 
captured sept 8 and accused of illegal entry afghan news reports 
also said they were spying they have not been tried 
a western diplomatic source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said there has been no suggestion that an appeal for clemency would 
hasten the germans release but he noted that west german 
diplomats have been allowed to visit splieth and ms hackstedt 
twice since their capture on sept 25 and on sunday 
the speed with which the visits were arranged was several months 
faster than those accorded foreign prisoners in the past and appear 
to be part of the afghan governments move to present a more 
humanitarian face to the world 
similarly the international committee of the red cross this 
year has been allowed to visit afghan political prisoners for the 
first time in the war 
france italy west germay and turkey along with the united 
states most other western nations and some nonwestern ones 
withdrew their ambassadors in protest of the soviet intervention in 
afghanistan their embassies in kabul are headed by charge 
daffaires 
their contacts with the afghan government are kept at a minimum 
they consist primarily of meetings with foreign ministry officials 
over visa and other consular matters and with security forces over 
safety measures for embassy grounds and staffers 
the two west german prisoners and one of the turks are in good 
health according to the diplomat sources the other turk demir 
appeared to be emotionally disturbed one source said the sources 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the turks were last visited by a representative of their 
government oct 6 the diplomat familiar with their situation 
described them as adventurers and said the espionage charges 
were unfounded 
he said uzel was accused of spying for the cia while demir was 
accused of being a west german agent he said uzel previously went 
to iran to fight ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis islamic regime uzel 
was captured by the iranian revolutionary guards but escaped and 
soon joined the afghan guerrillas 
uzel was captured in jawzjan province which borders the soviet 
union while demir was captured in kandahar province which borders 
pakistan 
splieth who is in his early 30s and ms hackstedt who is in 
her late 20s were working with a west german private relief 
organization called committee cap anamur according to the western 
diplomatic source 
they were captured near ghazni while returning to pakistan after 
working at a dispensary in bamyan province west of kabul

warm weather the party atmosphere 
surrounding homecoming weekend and increased alcohol consumption 
have been blamed for two nights of rioting at st cloud state 
university 
the catalyst for this whole thing was a lot of young people 
with a lot of booze in them assistant police chief jim moline 
said sunday theyre not experienced enough with alcohol and they 
just go kind of crazy 
things were quiet sunday night authorities said 
but the previous night police clad in riot gear clashed with 
students and others who burned furniture and a trash bin that had 
been dragged into the street sixty people were arrested including 
34 students police said on friday night two people were arrested 
at least six people including a police officer were treated at 
a hospital for minor injuries suffered saturday night and early 
sunday said hospital nursing supervisor patricia anderson 
students set off firecrackers and some played the beatles song 
revolution on a stereo as police swept through the crowd 
estimated at about 700 people saturday night other people tore 
down street signs and jumped on cars or threw beer bottles and 
pieces of lumber 
in all as many as 1500 people converged on a fourblock area 
both friday and saturday nights moline said 
brendan mcdonald president of the 16500student campus and 
several students said numerous outoftowners came to st cloud to 
look for parties after friday nights disturbance 
once it hit the news media it was like an open invitation 
mcdonald said some people will go any distance for a party 
while authorities blamed the violence on the rioters some 
students said police aggravated the situation by using excessive 
force 
both sides took it too far said student kevin stanek 
but moline praised officers for their handling of the 
disturbance in situations like this people have a tendency to 
say things that look to the public like they police are 
insensitive he said 
moline said that in his 31 years on the city police force the 
weekends violence could be topped only by demonstrations against 
the vietnam war in the 1960s 
the two people arrested friday night probably will be charged 
with felony assault for throwing beer bottles moline said those 
arrested saturday are likely to be charged with misdemeanors he 
said 
mcdonald met with school officials sunday to discuss the riots 
and university spokesman angelo gentile said a task force would be 
appointed to investigate university fraternities and sororities 
sponsored a cleanup rally sunday afternoon 
gentile said the university has no jurisdiction over private 
rooming houses near campus that were the source of some of the 
trouble

the communist party chief said today 
the party must adopt farreaching economic constitutional and 
political reforms to alleviate poverty and calm ethnic and social 
unrest 
we need a fundamental renewal of socialism which will throw 
out everything that is bad and outdated and replace it with new 
ways stipe suvar said in an opening speech to a meeting of the 
partys policysetting central committee 
the meeting of the central committee has been billed as a 
historic session to approve the most sweeping personnel changes in 
the four decades since the party came to power 
the renewal of socialism means taking off its old 
tightfitting suit and letting people breathe in new 
surroundings suvar told the 162 members of the committee 
all of us in this country are faced with a choice either we 
all resolve the crisis together or we all head to destruction 
he said in the 70page speech reported by the state news agency 
tanjug and excerpted on staterun radio and television 
suvar called for expanded private ownership increased foreign 
investment and the shutdown of unprofitable state enterprises he 
warned of possible layoffs but promised basic welfare for the 
unemployed 
he said unspecified leading jobs should be opened up to 
nonparty members but made clear the ruling league of communists 
has no intention of abandoning oneparty rule 
alluding to widespread calls for personnel changes he added 
all the incompetent and compromised people must go and the 
society must be ensured of a perspective 
personnel reform was high on the agenda at the meeting 
the expected changes come as yugoslavia experiences its worst 
economic and social crisis in 43 years of communist rule amid 
growing ethnic and social unrest living standards have fallen by 
onehalf since 1980 and austerity measures adopted in may have 
slashed salaries as prices rise inflation is at 217 percent and 
the foreign debt stands at 21 billion 
striking workers have taken to the streets in increasing 
numbers prompting alarmed officials to seek permission from the 
international monetary fund to relax the austerity program 
fourteen of the 23 members of the communist partys ruling 
politburo could be up for replacement at the meeting including 
four senior leaders whose recent resignations will have to be 
formally accepted at the meeting 
the four are former heads of the party bosko krunic and milanko 
renovica a leading communist from liberal northern slovenia franc 
setinc and a senior ethnic albanian from the troubled province of 
kosovo kolj siroka 
despite widespread calls from the yugoslav public for the 
session to be televised and broadcasted live most of the session 
will be closed belgrade radio said 
the dramatic changes are a response to calls from the largest 
republic serbia and from workers angered by falling living 
standards 
ethnic serbs want changes allowing their republic one of 
yugoslavias six to have more control over the provinces of kosovo 
and vojvodina 
workers want political and economic changes because they contend 
the top party leaders are inefficent and corrupt 
the criticism has touched even suvar who clashed last week with 
slobodan milosevic ambitious leader of the troubled republic of 
serbia the clash prompted a wave of requests from serbian party 
organizations for suvars resignation 
milosevics push for greater serbian control of its two 
provinces vojvodina and kosovo and increased central control in 
general in yugoslavia has stirred up the current political crisis 
mass rallies have taken place all over eastern and southern 
yugoslavia in recent weeks to press this campaign 
in a recent interview suvar said up to onethird of the central 
committee could be replaced at the meeting which is expected to 
last at least two days 
if several politburo members and onethird of the central 
committee do go it would be the most sweeping change of top 
personnel since the communists came to power after world war ii 
supporters of milosevic have said that if radical changes are 
not agreed on at this meeting they will demand an extraordinary 
party congress to try and get the changes they want the next such 
forum is not due until 1990 
nonserb leaders fear milosevic is trying to use his mass 
popularity in yugoslavias largest republic to expand the power of 
the countrys biggest ethnic group at the expense of others 
milosevic in fomenting the rallies has broken the order laid 
down by the countrys founding father josip tito who gave broad 
autonomy to yugoslavias six republics and two provinces and 
annually rotated national offices among them to prevent one region 
from dominating the others

a us official met for the first time 
today with two americans who were detained after entering laos to 
publicize a 24 million reward for missing us servicemen a us 
embassy official in laos said 
they looked all right and they did not allege any 
mistreatment the us official said but we still have no idea 
of the charges against them or how the case will be disposed of 
donna long of jacksonville nc and james copp of hampstead 
nc took a rented fishing boat across the mekong river boundary 
between thailand and laos and were arrested oct 3 at a village in 
the southern province of champasak 
they were moved last wednesday to the laotian capital of 
vientiane 
the two were planning to pass out dollar bills and other 
currency offering the reward to anyone who frees a us prisoner 
from communistruled laos cambodia and vietnam and turns him over 
to the international committee of the red cross 
these countries deny holding any americans from the vietnam war 
which ended in 1975 
a us embassy consular officer was granted access to the two 
americans today after repeated requests said the embassy official 
reached by telephone in vientiane 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said ms long 
and copp were being held at the passport office building where 
other foreigners have been held in recent years generally for 
illegal entry 
the two are members of the national steering committee for 
american war veterans a private lobbying group the 24 million 
reward for mias was offered by 21 us congressmen and private 
citizens 
on oct 7 four other members of the committee sailed into the 
same area of the mekong and dropped stamped currency notes into the 
water before the thai navy told them to return to the thai shore 
that group was led by committee chairman ted sampley a former 
green beret from kinston nc he said last week the committee 
would send another group of vietnam war veterans to the laotian 
side of the river if ms long and copp were not freed soon 
we will give lao government officials some more americans to 
put in their jails until jim and donna are released so they can 
return to their families sampley said in a telephone interview 
from kinston 
the us embassy official in vientiane said the laotian 
government was irritated at the groups activities on the mekong 
and the official media there called it silly and insulting 
they find it offensive to them and their sovereignty and their 
previous statements that they are not holding any live americans 
he said 
however he said laos has not tried to link the episode to 
overall relations with the united states 
the united states still seeks to account for 2393 americans 
listed as missing in action in the southeast asia war but no solid 
evidence has emerged that any are alive

men with the aids virus have aidsfree sperm 
raising the possibility that infected males may be able to father 
children through artificial insemination without passing the 
disease to the fetus researchers say 
dr bernard poiesz and colleagues at the state university of new 
york health science center at syracuse found that the aids virus is 
present in the seminal fluid in which the sperm is suspended but 
not in the sperm cells themselves the new york times reported 
today 
poiesz and researchers at the university of southern california 
working independently found that most men with aids do not even 
have the virus in their semen the times said 
researchers are baffled by this finding because theoretically 
if aids is present in the blood it should be present in semen 
since that fluid contains the white cells that the virus attacks 
poiesz reported the virus is present in about 20 percent of the 
semen samples of infected men while the virus is present in 
virtually 100 percent of their blood samples 
in contrast several years ago poiesz detected aids in 70 
percent of semen samples from infected men 
dr suraiya rasheed of usc also reported that researchers in her 
laboratory were no longer able to detect the aids virus in most 
semen samples from men whose blood samples show an infection rate 
of virtually 100 percent

siamese twins viet and duc were recovering well 
today 13 days after they were separated in an operation at a 
vietnamese hospital a japanese red cross official said 
yoshiaki nemoto quoted yoji araki a japanese doctor observing 
the vietnamese boys at tu du hospital in ho chi minh city as 
saying the twins were doing very well 
viet and duc were separated oct 4 by a 72member vietnamese 
medical team and have recovered without complications nemoto 
quoted araki as saying 
the 7yearold vietnamese boys are believed to be the oldest 
siamese twins ever separated 
viet and duc were joined at the pelvis and shared genitals and a 
single pair of legs as well as one bowel an anus a bladder and a 
pair of kidneys 
the japan red cross donated most of the medical equipment and 
medicine for the operation 
vietnamese officials have attributed the reported increase in 
births of siamese twins in vietnam to the us use of defoliants 
during the vietnam war including in the central highlands where 
viet and duc were born in february 1981 
the defoliants included agent orange which contains a compound 
dioxin known to produce birth defects in animals

five nuns who have spent nearly two 
weeks barricaded inside the infirmary of their monastery to protest 
modernization have called off talks with a priest sent by the 
vatican to end the impasse 
the nuns rejected the rev kevin culligan a friar from 
wisconsin on sunday because of his friendship with the monasterys 
prioress against whom they are rebelling said sister bernadette 
one of the protesting nuns 
they also challenge his legitimacy because he failed to show a 
vatican seal on his credentials the nuns said talks saturday 
produced no agreement 
he said he came here to assess whether this is an authentic 
carmelite monastery sister bernadette said we kept telling 
him we have a case in rome 
the carmelite nuns today entered their 14th day in 
selfsegregation their actions have brought international 
attention to the roman catholic monastery of the most blessed 
virgin mary of mount carmel 
on oct 4 the five sisters of the order of discalced carmelites 
isolated themselves in the monasterys infirmary 
they say they acted out of fear that the diocese of paterson 
would evict them the five oppose liberalization efforts that 
include the introduction of sweets radio and television that they 
say detract from the life of prayer and austerity they vowed to 
lead 
they have said they will not give up their vigil until their 
case is considered by the vatican in rome which under canon law is 
the official arbitrator in disputes within a religious order 
bishop frank rodimer head of the diocese has said the nuns 
could be relieved of their vows for their defiance

the supreme court today agreed to hear a 
reagan administration appeal aimed at making it easier for the 
government to conduct taxfraud investigations 
the justices said they will use a california case involving the 
church of scientology to settle a dispute over the power of the 
internal revenue service to obtain and use confidential documents 
particularly communications between lawyers and clients 
the government which has had numerous legal battles with the 
scientologists began an investigation in 1984 of the tax returns 
of the churchs founder l ron hubbard who died on jan 24 1986 
the irs said it suspected that millions of dollars in church 
funds were transferred to hubbard in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
in a scheme to protect the churchs taxexempt status and avoid 
paying taxes on the money 
the irs issued a summons in october 1984 for 13 confidential 
documents held by a california state court in connection with a 
private lawsuit involving the church 
a federal judge ruled that five of the documents should be 
turned over to the irs but only on condition the irs not disclose 
the contents to any other governmental agency except in connection 
with a criminal tax prosecution 
the judge blocked the irs from obtaining the other eight 
documents particularly taped conversations of confidential 
lawyerclient communications 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals upheld the judges ruling 
in 1986 
the appeals court said barring the irs from turning over 
documents to other agencies is a wise exercise of control by 
the courts to protect the rights of citizens 
the appeals court also said the government is not entitled to 
see attorneyclient communications unless it can produce 
independent evidence that the lawyer is taking part in a fraud 
the justice department appealing on behalf of the irs proposed 
that a federal judge examine the confidential documents to 
determine whether there is evidence of fraud 
the department said the appeals court ruling will 
significantly impair irs investigations because the actual 
contents of an attorneyclient communication will often be the best 
evidence of whether a lawyer has participated in fraud 
the department also said the 9th circuit court ruling is in 
conflict with decisions by other federal appeals courts the 9th 
circuit has jurisdiction in arizona alaska california hawaii 
idaho montana nevada oregon and washington 
the case is us vs zolin 8840

the supreme court today refused to block a 10 
million lawsuit against the manufacturer of a governmentapproved 
whooping cough vaccine that allegedly caused brain damage in an 
infant who was inoculated 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling in a virginia 
case that federal law does not foreclose such suits under state 
regulations that protect consumers against defectively designed 
products 
tracy abbot was five months old in august 1983 when she was 
inoculated with a vaccine called triimmunol manufactured by 
lederle laboratories a division of american cyanamid co 
her mother filed a lawsuit in 1986 seeking 10 million in 
damages on grounds the vaccine caused brain damage in tracy 
triimmunol is a vaccine against diphtheria tetanus and 
whooping cough or pertussis and is administered to millions of 
children without serious side effects but it has caused serious 
injury in a small number of children 
the vaccine is approved by the federal food and drug 
administration and other government health agencies 
whooping cough claimed thousands of lives before the vaccine was 
developed the most serious us epidemic was in 1934 when there 
were 265000 reported cases and 7500 deaths 
the abbot suit said lederle failed to develop a safer whooping 
cough vaccine even though other forms of the vaccine have been 
used outside the united states the suit said triimmunol is 
unreasonably dangerous 
only one other company in the united states is licensed to 
produce a whooping cough vaccine 
a federal judge threw out the abbot suit but the 4th us 
circuit court of appeals reinstated it last april 
the appeals court rejected arguments that the federal 
governments interest in promoting use of the vaccine is frustrated 
by permitting suits alleging violation of state regulations 
federal law does not preempt such suits the appeals court said 
in a somewhat related issue the supreme court ruled last june 
that the government may be forced to pay damages when a vaccine it 
licenses causes the disease it was intended to prevent that case 
reinstated a suit in behalf of a boy who contracted polio after 
receiving a dose of federally approved vaccine 
the reagan administration has not announced a position on the 
abbot suit but the justice department has pointed out that 
alternative vaccines to the type lederle produces have not been 
proven safe and effective 
congress has passed a law which took full effect oct 1 creating 
a fund to help compensate children injured by vaccines the new law 
places a tax on some vaccines to provide funds for injuries that 
occur from vaccinations after 1986 
the case is american cyanamid vs abbot 88330

associated press writer 
washington ap the supreme court today agreed to consider 
allowing states to give larger retirement benefits to public 
employees forced to quit work before age 60 
the court said it will review a ruling that struck down an ohio 
pension law provision on grounds it violated a federal law against 
discrimination based on age 
the ohio provision was challenged by june betts a former speech 
pathologist for the hamilton county mental retardation department 
when her work degenerated because of medical problems ms betts 
was given a choice by the state in 1985 of taking unpaid medical 
leave or retirement with a standard pension 
she was barred from receiving more generous disability 
retirement benefits because she was 61 
a provision of the state pension plan allowed disability 
benefits only for those who worked for the state for at least five 
years and were under 60 when forced to quit 
ms betts pension would have been 15850 a month under the 
standard plan compared to 355 a month in disability retirement 
benefits 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals last june upheld a federal 
judges ruling in ms betts favor that threw out the states 
agebased pension provision 
the appeals court said the provision violated the federal age 
discrimination in employment act 
the appeals court said the federal law permits agebased 
benefits only when they can be justified by a substantial 
business purpose 
ohio officials failed to prove that giving larger benefits to 
younger workers is justified by cost considerations the appeals 
court said 
in fact the appeals court said such an arrangement might prove 
more costly to the state since a worker who becomes disabled at a 
younger age would draw more in benefits over the course of the 
workers lifetime than someone disabled at 60 or older 
ohio officials argued that the states agebased provision is 
permissible because it was adopted prior to enactment of the 
federal age discrimination in employment act the state said 
federal appeals courts other than the 6th circuit have agreed with 
its position 
the case is public employees retirement system of ohio vs 
betts 88389

broke into pieces and burned early today while trying to land in 
heavy fog at romes main airport officials reported 30 people were 
killed 
all of the surviving 22 people on flight 775 from londons 
gatwick airport to entebbe uganda via rome apparently were 
injured said carlo iovinella director of the airport police 
the boeing 707 tore through the side of a wooden house clipped 
a garage demolished an unoccupied brick house and then barreled 
through the parking lot of a rental car agency 
at that point an engine and part of a wing fell off and the 
impact started a fire that destroyed about 75 cars 
the rest of the plane slid across a road through a fence and 
knocked down trees before it broke into pieces and burst into 
flames about a halfmile south of the runway at leonardo da vinci 
airport 15 miles southwest of rome 
one man in the wooden house carlo satta 30 suffered minor 
injuries when the roof collapsed 
i was awake and heard a ringing sound two seconds later it 
sounded like the gas cylinders in the house had blown up a few 
seconds later all the cars were in flames said the injured mans 
father luigi 
passenger john harigye a former ugandan ambassador to the 
vatican who was hospitalized in good condition with burns told the 
italian news agency ansa that the plane aborted one landing attempt 
because of the fog and tried again about 15 minutes later

and immediately afterwards the flames burst out he said my 
seat was upside down but i released my seat belt opened the 
emergency exit and got out with the woman sitting near me we began 
to run and we heard a second explosion on the airplane 
the commander of rome provinces fire department guido 
chiucini speculated the pilot and the control tower might have had 
a misunderstanding about the landing

ugandans and three britons were among the injured but the 
nationalities of the others aboard were not immediately available 
workers had recovered the remains of at least 28 victims at the

passengers and seven crew members were aboard the jetliner when it 
crashed at 1231 am he said 24 injured people were taken to four

reputed philadelphiaarea crime boss nicodemo 
scarfo lost a supreme court appeal today to overturn his 
extortionconspiracy conviction 
the court without comment rejected arguments that scarfo did 
not receive a fair trial 
scarfo described as the head of organized crime in eastern 
pennsylvania and parts of new jersey is serving a 14year prison 
term for scheming to extort 1 million from a developer of the 
penns landing redevelopment project on the philadelphia waterfront 
the developer rouse amp associates told the fbi of the extortion 
plan that called for it to pay 1 million in exchange for backing 
from philadelphia city councilman leland beloff for the project 
beloff and his administrative aide robert rego were tried 
separately and convicted in the kickback scheme 
scarfo said he did not receive a fair trial in part because the 
jurors names were withheld when they were selected they were 
identified only by number 
also the trial judge in explaining the reason for the anonymity 
told the jurors he wanted to assure them that they or their 
families had no reason to fear 
there will be a lot of testimony concerning organized crime 
the judge said i have never heard of a case where any defendant 
ever tried to cause harm to a juror or a member of the jurors 
family but we all watch television we all read newspapers we see 
the godfather movies i wanted to make sure that no member of the 
jury would worry about it 
also scarfo said the jury was influenced improperly by 
testimony about extraneous crimes presented with frightening 
imagery and detail 
for example the prosecutor summed up the case by saying scarfo 
is a shrewd clever and dangerous man he rules his criminal army 
with a deadly iron fist he keeps his soldiers in mortal fear 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals upheld the conviction last 
july 
the appeals court said anonymity for the jurors and the 
explanation the trial judge gave for the procedure may have helped 
dispel the jurors fears and served the ideal of dispassionate 
judgment 
the appeals court also upheld the use of testimony by mob hit 
men who testified for the government that they carried out murders 
at scarfos behest 
the prosecution used the testimony to try and prove that the 
witnesses cooperated with the government for fear they would meet 
the same fate the appeals court said 
the case is scarfo vs us 88498

five reputed organized crime figures from 
michigan who challenged fbi wiretaps that led to their 
gamblingrelated convictions lost a supreme court appeal today 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that evidence 
from the electronic surveillance could be used against them 
the appeals were by vito giacalone his son jack anthony 
giacolone mario agosta and albert hady 
all but anthony giacalone were convicted of taking part in a 
racketeering scheme to collect illegal gambling debts anthony 
giacalone was convicted of conducting illegal gambling 
under a plea bargain agreement each was sentenced to one to 
five years in prison they pleaded guilty while reserving the right 
to appeal the convictions and pretrial rulings 
the defendants challenged the use of wiretaps at farm fresh 
produce inc in detroit 
fbi agents said confidential informants told them local 
restaurant owners were being threatened and intimidated into 
purchasing food from farm fresh 
the wiretaps approved by a federal judge on july 28 1982 were 
intended to gather evidence of extortion 
the wiretaps remained in place for nearly five months and while 
the fbi failed to get evidence of extortion it did get enough to 
win an indictment in 1986 against the five on the gamblingrelated 
charges 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals last august rejected 
arguments that the wiretaps were unlawful and that evidence yielded 
by them should be suppressed 
the five defendants said a federal judge should have questioned 
the fbi informants in private to determine their veracity before 
allowing evidence from the wiretaps to be used 
but the 6th circuit court said it was enough that the judge 
questioned the fbi agents behind closed doors 
suppression is required only when the law enforcement 
official seeking a wiretap deliberately lied or testified in 
reckless disregard of the truth the appeals court said 
the appeals court also rejected arguments that the wiretaps were 
approved without probable cause to believe the defendants would use 
their telephones for extortion 
the judge who approved the wiretaps could reasonably conclude 
that there was a fair probability that defendants would refer to 
their illegal activities during the course of their telephone 
conversations with their customers and others the appeals court 
said 
the appeals court also dismissed the defendants claim that the 
surveillance was too extensive 
the case is giacalone vs us 88509

labor party leader shimon peres today 
proposed elections in the occupied west bank and gaza strip to 
select palestinians who would negotiate peace with israel 
the call was part of a policy statement issued by peres and 
labors defense minister yitzhak rabin in the campaign for israels 
general elections nov 1 
polls indicate labor and the governing likud bloc are running 
neckandneck 
in the occupied gaza strip today troops shot and wounded eight 
palestinians including two 13yearold boys during clashes in the 
towns of rafah and khan yunis hospital officials said 
on sunday prime minister yitzhak shamir head of the likud 
bloc vowed that nothing will remain of palestinians who carry 
out threats to use firearms against israel 
peres and rabin told reporters today that any palestinian living 
in the occupied territories should be permitted to run in 
elections even if they supported the banned palestine liberation 
organization 
the labor leaders said a cessation of antiisraeli violence for 
a period of three to six months was a precondition for such 
elections 
if the violence is restrained we will hold free elections in 
judea samaria and gaza so that a palestinian delegation can be 
elected to represent the palestinian side in negotiations 
peres said using the biblical names for the west bank 
he said that if efforts to arrange formal peace negotiations 
fail a laborled government would transfer control of municipal 
and local affairs to elected leaders from the territories with the 
israeli army only in charge of security the army now runs daily 
municipal affairs in the occupied lands 
elections were last held in the west bank in 1976 when mayors 
were chosen in major towns and cities the officials all supported 
the plo and refused to act as representatives in peace negotiations 
shamir made his remark against palestinian use of firearms 
sunday to more than 2000 supporters in the southern town of 
sderot according to his spokesman yossi ahimeir 
ahimeir said shamir was responding to arab news reports that 
hani hassan an aide to plo chief yasser arafat had said 
palestinians would exchange their stonethrowing methods against 
israeli troops for firearms if shamir is reelected prime minister 
if the arabs of judea samaria and gaza start fighting the 
army with firearms nothing will remain of those terrorists and 
there is no doubt that an end will come to the intefadeh arabic 
for uprising shamir said according to ahimeir 
so far palestinians have primarily confronted israeli troops 
and civilians with stones bottles and firebombs 
however the recent use of firearms by palestinians included two 
grenades hurled at army vehicles in gaza last week injuring two 
soldiers 
the 10monthold palestinian uprising against israel in which 
299 arabs have been killed and about 7000 wounded has emerged as 
the primary issue in the national elections six israelis have been 
killed in the unrest 
army figures show 896 israelis have been injured in the 
rebellion including 575 troops and 321 civilians israel radio 
reported 
the likud bloc opposes withdrawal from the lands israel captured 
in the 1967 middle east war

a researcher who shared the nobel prize for 
medicine today said the best reward is still knowing his work has 
saved lives while his longtime colleague says she was more 
disbelieving than anything after journalists gave her the news 
the phone keeps ringing and i cant seem to finish getting 
dressed or anything else said gertrude elion a researcher at 
burroughs wellcome co since 1944 from her home in chapel hill 
i think im going to have trouble getting to work on time 
elion 70 george h hitchings 83 another longtime wellcome 
researcher and a british scientist shared the award and will split 
a prize worth 390000 
its wonderful for my descendents joked hitchings a former 
burroughs wellcome vice president ive had many awards but my 
real awards have come from patients whose lives have been saved by 
the drugs ive invented 
the work of elion and hitchings led to a series of drugs for the 
treatment of cancer and a variety of other diseases burroughs 
wellcome is a major pharmaceutical company 
elion said she first got the news at 630 am from a reporter 
and had not yet heard from nobel officials 
surprised is not exactly the word she said when asked her 
reaction to the prize disbelieving is the right word as i say 
i havent heard from the nobel people and until they confirm it i 
wont believe it i did not even know i had been nominated for it 
she said a reporter had read her parts of the citation but it 
was fairly vague i dont even know exactly what the award is for 
at this point 
she said she had collaborated with hitchings for more than 40 
years 
thats why its so surprising when something like this happens 
after so many years she said 
i havent been able to use the phone to call him she said 
of hitchings but other people who have called have told me they 
talked to him so i know he knows about it i think ill have to go 
use a phone somewhere else but first ive got to run a comb 
through my hair 
hitchings who was born in hoquiam wash received a doctorate 
in biochemistry from harvard in 1933 and holds more than 80 
american patents he joined burroughs wellcome in 1942 as a 
biochemist and retired in 1975 as vice president for research 
elion a native of new york city received a bachelors degree 
from hunter college in 1937 and a masters degree in chemistry 
from new york university in 1941 she joined burroughs wellcome in 
1944 as a biochemist in 1967 she was appointed head of the 
department of experimental therapy a position she held until her 
retirment in 1983 
hitchings and elion followed a line of nucleic acid research 
that led to the discovery of new drugs for malaria leukemia gout 
bacterial infections and the first immune suppressant to make 
kidney transplants possible the company said 
the drugs developed by the two scientists include imuran for 
kidney transplants purinethol a cancer drug used to treat 
leukemia patients zyloprim for gout and zovirax the first drug 
developed for the treatment of herpes virus infections said 
burroughs wellcome spokeswoman kathy bartlett 
the researchers hold the title of scientist emeritus at 
burroughs wellcome signifying that they are retired despite their 
retirement both have continued to work on projects said another 
company spokesman thack brown 
both of them still come to work every day brown said 
they both have their own research projects but they were so 
involved in so many things that were going on in research that 
theyre still consulted 
this is the third nobel prize for burroughs wellcome ms 
bartlett said 
in 1936 sir henry dale an early director of research and 
chairman of the wellcome trust was awarded a nobel in medicine for 
his studies of chemical transmission of nerve impulses in 1982 
sir john vane group research and development director won a nobel 
in medicine for his role in discovering the way in which aspirin

once served as the headquarters for the nowdefunct ecclesia 
athletic association brought the dead child to a fire station 25 
miles east of portland early friday 
investigators later found the other children in the fourbedroom 
farmhouse some with scars that might indicate physical abuse said 
sheriffs capt pat detloff 
the children ranging in age from 1 months to 16 years were 
hungry but otherwise healthy according to officials who admitted 
them to state juvenile facilities over the weekend all reportedly 
were from los angeles

the soviet union wants direct talks with the moslem forces fighting 
the moscowbacked afghan government official afghan radio said 
troops killed two americans who were helping guerrillas 
the green lights have been shown for direct negotiations 
said burhanuddin rabbani current chairman of a sevenparty afghan 
guerrilla alliance headquartered in peshawar pakistan he did not 
elaborate 
the negotiations and how they will happen will be seen in the 
future rabbani told reporters after returning from a fiveweek 
trip to northern afghanistan 
no comment to the report was immediately available from the 
soviet union 
in negotiating a unmediated agreement in april to withdraw 
soviet troops moscow did not meet with the usbacked guerrillas 
and spoke instead with pakistani officials 
rabbani ruled out any coalition government that included 
communists but he said there was room in a guerrillacontrolled 
government for some elements from kabul 
noncommunist elements working in kabul could be included 
he said 
official radio kabul on sunday did not identify the americans 
reportedly killed in the attack a day earlier but a western 
diplomat in islamabad denied us citizens were in afghanistan on 
government business the broadcast contended the americans were 
helping the guerrillas 
the diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said he had 
heard nothing of american citizens being killed in afghanistan 
soviet officials often have alleged that us personnel trains 
guerrilla forces near the afghan border in pakistan american 
reporters often travel to the afghan capital kabul and to other 
areas 
radio kabul in a broadcast monitored in islamabad said the 
americans and two pakistani officers died saturday when government 
forces attacked moslem guerrilla positions near gardez city about 
60 miles southeast of kabul 
in washington state department spokeswoman nancy beck said she 
knew nothing of the report and said she could not even say whether

charles thornton a reporter for the arizona republic newspaper 
and independent filmmakers lee shapiro of north bergen nj and 
jim landiloff of sacramento calif 
the pakistani government had no immediate comment on the report 
in other developments the afghan foreign ministry sent its 
100th note of protest alleging pakistani violations of the 
unmediated agreement aimed at ending the fighting in 
afghanistan tass said 
the accord signed april 14 in geneva requires the soviet union 
to withdraw its armed forces from afghanistan by february the 
soviets say half of their more than 100000 troops are back home 
the soviets and the afghans accuse pakistan of violating the 
agreement by allowing its territory to be used as a base by 
usbacked rebel groups and by permitting arms and munitions to 
cross pakistan to the insurgents 
the soviets intervened in afghanistan in december 1979 to 
preside over the replacement of one marxist ruler by another and 
stayed on to fight the insurgency

a man who lost a cabin to 
this summers fires in the yellowstone national park area has filed 
a claim with the us forest service and expects others to join in 
his legal action 
dr glenn watters whose 60000 nearly finished cabin in cooke 
pass north of powell was one of four destroyed when a backfire 
started by firefighters roared out of control predicts a rash of 
lawsuits against the government unless it properly reimburses 
property owners for their losses 
there will be the darnedest classaction lawsuit you ever saw 
in your life he told the denver post 
fires charred more than 16 million acres in the worst fire 
season in the parks history 
i think we were betrayed said charlotte ficken of powell 
whose mobile home southeast of cooke city mont was destroyed by 
fires despite firefighters assurances it would be protected i 
just dont think we got any help so we just burned 
federal policies call for claims to be paid only if government 
negligence can be proven but watters said he does not believe that 
will be a problem 
the national park service realizes they blew it he said 
they tell you now that they were suppressing those fires but 
they werent they were as proud as peacocks of those natural fires 
that they were letting burn and then they let things get away 
from them 
under national park service and forest service policies 
naturally caused fires in parks or wilderness areas were allowed to 
burn unless they threatened structures or safety both agencies 
switched to the offensive against fires in july because of 
extremely dry conditions 
a number of business owners around the park have claimed they 
lost money because the fires discouraged travelers from visiting 
the yellowstone area 
four wyoming counties have been declared disaster areas 
clearing the way for lowinterest loans but the loans are not 
expected to help those who lost summer or permanent homes or 
outfitters who lost business because of the fires

american researchers gertrude elion and 
george h hitchings won the 1988 nobel prize in medicine today for 
discoveries leading to drugs that treat aids and herpes 
sir james w black of great britain shared the award for 
research that led to a beta blocker drug for heart disease and a 
drug for peptic ulcers black quipped today that the prize came as 
such a shock that i wished i had my beta blockers handy 
the americans research also led to the development of drugs for 
the treatment of leukemia malaria and to fight the rejection of 
transplanted organs said the nobel assembly of the karolinska 
institute 
elion 70 a new york city native and hitchings 83 born in 
hoquiam wash are affiliated with wellcome research laboratories 
in research triangle park nc black 64 born in scotland works 
at kings college hospital medical school at the university of 
london 
im pleased more for my descendants than i am for myself 
hitchings said in a telephone interview from his office ive had 
a lot of honors but the most important honors for me have been 
meeting patients whose lives have been saved or whose childrens 
lives have been saved by drugs ive invented 
elion said from her home in chapel hill nc surprised is 
not exactly the word disbelieving is the right word i 
didnt even know i had been nominated 
the work of elion and hitchings broke new ground in finding the 
difference in the processing of genetic material between normal 
cells and cancer cells protozoa bacteria and viruses the 
karolinska institute said 
knowing those differences allowed researchers to attack 
diseasecausing organisms by interfering with their replication 
the announcement said 
the institute said that among the drugs developed from their 
ideas is azidothymidine or azt which has had the best documented 
results in the treatment of aids the institute said azt is the 
only federally approved drug for treating acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome in the united states 
we are still harvesting the fruits of what they determined 
almost 40 years ago said folke sjoqvist a member of the nobel 
assembly 
their discoveries in the late 1940s led to a variety of drugs 
like 6mercaptopurine in 1951 for leukemia they also developed 
azathioprine which was for many years the only drug available to 
prevent the rejection of transplanted organs 
another breakthrough in applying their research came in 1977 
when the first effective drug was developed for treating herpes 
virus infections the drug acyclovir does not cure genital 
herpes but it makes outbreaks of sores less severe and makes them 
heal faster 
in 1964 black developed the first clinically useful beta 
blocker drug propranolol for use in the treatment of heart 
disease 
propranolol acts on beta receptors on nerves leading to the 
heart and blocks the stimulating effect of adrenaline receptors 
are specific places to which drugs and natural substances attach 
themselves to produce their effects 
physiologist bengt pernow another member of the nobel assembly 
said black made the greatest breakthrough when it comes to 
pharmaceuticals against heart illness since the disovery of 
digitalis 200 years ago 
in 1972 black discovered a group of histamine receptors a 
finding that led to the development of the drug cimetidine for 
peptic ulcer 
the three winners will share a cash award of 25 million kronor 
or about 390000 which they will receive at an awards ceremony 
dec 10 
the prize was approved by a majority vote of the institutes 
50member nobel assembly on the recommendation of a fivemember 
committee which studied hundreds of research briefs 
hitchings received a bachelors degree from the university of 
washington in 1927 and a doctorate from harvard university in 1933 
after teaching at harvard and western reserve university he 
joined burroughs wellcome co a pharmaceutical firm in 1942 
wellcome research laboratories is the companys research arm 
hitchings became burroughs wellcomes research director in 1955 
he was a director of the company from 1968 to 1984 and has been a 
professor at duke university and brown university 
elion earned her bachelors degree from hunter college and a 
masters degree from new york university 
she has worked at wellcome research labs since 1944 and as a 
senior research chemist since 1950 since 1983 she has been a 
scientist emeritus at the laboratory and a research professor of 
pharmacology at duke 
black received bachelor of surgery and bachelor of medicine 
degrees from university of st andrews in scotland 
the medicine prize is the first of four nobel prizes to be 
announced this week on tuesday the laureate in economic sciences 
will be named and prizes in physics and chemistry will be awarded 
wednesday 
the nobels were first awarded in 1901 five years after the 
death of alfred nobel who made a fortune on his invention of 
dynamite 
no us researcher won the medicine prize until 1933 in the 
last 20 years there have been 30 us laureates and 19 from all 
other countries 
last years winner was susumu tonegawa of japan who conducted 
his study of the bodys immune system at the massachusetts 
institute of technology 
the nobel peace prize went this year to the un peacekeeping 
forces the literature prize was won by egyptian naguib mahfouz 
the first arabiclanguage laureate in the 87year history of the

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
reinstating a criminal conviction against a man who burned an 
american flag at a demonstration during the 1984 republican 
national convention in dallas 
the court said it will review a ruling that the flag burning was 
a form of symbolic expression protected by the constitution 
the texas court of criminal appeals last april threw out the 
conviction of gregory lee johnson who had been sentenced to one 
year in jail and fined 2000 
johnson was arrested on aug 22 1984 while participating in a 
demonstration against the reagan administration and the republicans 
the protest had culminated with a rally in front of dallas city 
hall that included political chants and the flag burning 
johnson was convicted by a jury of violating a state law banning 
the desecration of a venerated object 
the texas court of criminal appeals said given the context of 
an organized demonstration speeches slogans and the distribution 
of literature anyone who observed johnsons act would have 
understood the message that he intended to convey the act for 
which he was convicted was clearly speech contemplated by the 
first amendment 
the state court said the texas law against flag desecration is 
too broad because it seeks to curb expression likely to cause 
serious offense 
in other action the court 
set the stage for an important libel law ruling by agreeing to 
review a 200000 award won against a hamilton ohio newspaper 
the court will use an appeal by the hamilton journal news to 
decide sometime by july how closely appeals courts must 
scrutinize jury findings of actual malice when a public figure 
sues for libel 
refused to block a 10 million lawsuit against the 
manufacturer of a governmentapproved whooping cough vaccine that 
allegedly caused brain damage in an infant who was inoculated 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling in a virginia 
case that federal law does not foreclose such suits under state 
regulations that protect consumers against defectively designed 
products 
left intact the espionage and theft convictions of a former 
us intelligence analyst who gave secret satellite photographs to 
a british magazine 
the justices without comment rejected an appeal by samuel 
loring morison who is serving a twoyear prison sentence for 
leaking the photos of a soviet ship to janes defence weekly 
agreed to hear a reagan administration appeal aimed at making 
it easier for the government to conduct taxfraud investigations 
the justices said they will use a california case involving the 
church of scientology to settle a dispute over the power of the 
internal revenue service to obtain and use confidential documents 
particularly communications between lawyers and clients 
agreed to consider allowing states to give larger retirement 
benefits to public employees forced to quit work before age 60 
the court said it will review a ruling that struck down an ohio 
pension law provision on grounds it violated a federal law against 
discrimination based on age 
ordered a lower court to consider reinstating a virginia law 
that limits access by children to sexually explicit material in 
bookstores 
the justices set aside a ruling that declared the law 
unconstitutional and ordered further study in light of a new 
analysis that said the statute has limited applications 
in the flag case police officers who arrested johnson said they 
were seriously offended by the flag burning 
there also was testimony that the charred fragments of the flag 
were collected by an employee of the us army corps of engineers 
who was so upset that he later buried the flags remains in his 
backyard 
but the state court said seriously offending someone is not the 
same as inciting to riot an activity that permits restraints on 
free speech 
one cannot equate serious offense with incitement to breach 
the peace the state court said 
the state court also rejected arguments by law enforcement 
officials that the antidesecration statute legitimately preserves 
the flag as a symbol of unity 
recognizing that the right to differ is the centerpiece of our 
first amendment freedoms a government cannot mandate by fiat a 
feeling of unity in its citizens the state court said 
therefore that very same government cannot carve out a symbol of 
unity and prescribe a set of approved messages to be associated 
with that symbol when it cannot mandate the status or feeling the 
symbol purports to present 
the state court did not declare the law itself unconstitutional 
it declined to decide whether there might be situations where flag 
burning does not represent symbolic speech and may be prosecuted 
the state court cited several supreme court rulings to support 
its decision including a 1974 ruling that threw out the conviction 
of a man who displayed an american flag with a peace symbol 
attached to it 
the case is texas vs johnson 88155

two dartmouth college graduate students 
who were rappelling down steep cliffs were killed after plunging to 
a trail below authorities said today 
they were rappelling down and apparently were both tied to the 
same anchor point and when one fell it broke the point where it 
was tied off said maj henry mock of the state fish and game 
department 
about 50 rescuers worked more than five hours on 4060foot 
cannon mountain to retrieve the bodies of joel sunshine 24 of 
irvine calif and marc fragge 23 of fort mitchell ky mock 
said 
the two were climbing a section of cannon cliffs called beware 
of the dog 
mock said authorities had not determined how far the two fell 
but believe the accident happened at 338 pm sunday because a 
watch strapped to one of the climbers packs was smashed and had 
stopped at that time 
two other climbers who were hiking the trail below cannon cliffs 
found the bodies at 520 pm mock said 
both men were engineering students at dartmouths thayer school

a group of us physicians that toured 
kurdish refugee camps has concluded iraq used chemical weapons 
against the ethnic kurdish minority in northern iraq a spokesman 
said 
dr robert mullan cookdeegan representing the bostonbased 
physicians for human rights said iraq most likely used a high 
dose of one of the kind of irritant agents or a nerve agent he 
did not elaborate 
the physician also accused turkey of covering up iraqs use of 
chemical weapons for security and economic reasons 
turkey wants to keep good relations with iraq and win a role in 
rebuilding the nation after its 8year war with iran 
a turkish government report maintains no traces of poison gas 
were found on the refugees during medical screenings but turkish 
officials have said their report does not eliminate the possibility 
that iraq used such weapons 
cookdeegan said the groups findings were based on interviews 
with more than 100 kurds who fled into turkey and also on medical 
questionnaires given to 25 refugees 
the doctor a senior associate working for the office of 
technology assessment at the us congress spoke to the associated 
press in an interview thursday on condition the information be used 
sunday after the threemember delegation left turkey 
the teams other two members were dr howaro hu from the harvard 
school of public health and asfandiar shukri a detroitbased 
physician 
about 60000 kurds fled to turkey in august claiming iraq 
dropped chemical bombs on their settlements they now live in five 
tent cities in southeastern turkey 
it is difficult to explain the sudden exodus of people that 
were used to being shot at if it would have been a conventional 
weapon attack there would have been evidence of physical injuries 
such as bullet wounds cookdeegan said 
iraq used chemical weapons particularly on a population within 
its border he said 
he said the kurdish refugees most commonly complained about 
bloody diarrhea vomiting skin irritation and eye and respiratory 
problems 
those are very typical symptoms of chemical agents called 
irritants cookdeegan said 
he added that the refugees also described small animals such as 
birds and bees dying right after the attack 
cookdeegan criticized the turkish government for witholding 
information about the issue 
he said the turkish government also did not release the results 
of autopsy reports on kurdish refugees who died immediately after 
arriving in turkey 
the turkish government announced a month ago that it would turn 
down any efforts to send un experts into turkey to determine if 
iraq used poison gas against kurds 
the 14page questionnaire used by the threemember team 
contained dozens of queries requiring detailed answers about the 
respondents health before and after the attack 
cookdeegan said they will analyze the questionnaires and 
prepare a report in a month 
investigators for the us senate foreign relations committee 
also reported after touring the refugee camps in turkey that iraq 
used chemical weapons in attacks to depopulate iraqs kurdish 
regions 
we find no question that iraqs policy in kurdistan has the 
characteristics of genocide the two staff members peter w 
galbraith and christopher von hollen jr concluded in a report to 
the foreign relations commitee chairman claiborne pell dri 
last month 
the kurds 20 million people living in a region that lies in 
turkey iran and iraq have been fighting battles for independence 
for the past century 
the latest rebellion took advantage of iraqs war with iran 
soon after an aug 20 ceasefire went into effect in that war 
iraq turned upon the kurds unleashing warhardened elite troops 
upon the kurdish guerrillas

george bush today resumed his attack on 
presidential rival michael dukakis as weak on defense accusing the 
democrat of spreading misinformation about the state of us 
military forces 
the republican vice president in remarks prepared for delivery 
at a martin marietta defense contractor plant said dukakis is 
trying desperately to jump into the mainstream by acknowledging 
a need to modernize landbased defenses 
but there is strong reason to doubt that he would do it 
especially when it comes to modernizing our landbased missiles he 
still opposes the mx and he thinks the midgetman costs too much so 
he says hes going to work with congress to find another way 
wake up governor weve done all that bush said adding 
that in 1983 the bipartisan scowcroft commission was formed to 
study national defense issues 
bush called on dukakis to stop spreading what he called 
misinformation about the state of us forces 
its not 1980 anymore our divisional war fighting 
capabilities have improved by an average of 60 percent since 
1980 bush said notwithstanding my opponents claims only a 
few of the a6s are grounded because of wing cracks not one 
third weve got the money to fix them as fast as the manufacturer 
can do it 
governor its time to stop running down our defenses bush 
said 
in his first news conference in more than two weeks bush said 
sunday that questions such as a query about his agenda for the 
first 60 days in office are putting me beyond where i want to 
be 
so if i dont answer some of them from here on in it is 
because im focusing on november 8 and i dont want to be dragged 
beyond that because things seem to be going well now bush said 
the gop nominee has a solid lead in many national polls and 
electoral college surveys 
bush enjoyed a lowkey sunday joining family members at a 
football game between the denver broncos and the atlanta falcons 
the vice president who viewed the game from a private box was 
introduced at halftime to a mixture of cheers and boos 
at the news conference the gop nominee declined to say what 
budget cuts he would make to balance the budget and was unspecific 
when asked how he would deal with funding for the nicaraguan rebels 
and whether the homeless problem warrants special cabinetlevel 
supervision 
bush said he already has a team studying the transition to a 
bush presidency and that he is ready to name his cabinet quickly 
former navy undersecretary chase untermeyer heads the bush 
transition team 
he has drawn up wiring diagrams what we should do if we 
win bush said you have to hit the ground running 
the vice president however scoffed at suggestions that he 
already had decided on most of the cabinet members he would choose 
i cant let myself think about that im not going to do 
something that dumb and shift gears bush said 
referring to his escalating poll ratings since thursdays 
debate he said i can tell you ive been encouraged certainly 
not one scintilla of overconfidence 
bush did not disclose where he would make deficitreducing 
budget cuts because that is something he will work out with 
congress when the times comes according to his staff 
you have to sit down and know the facts at the time bush 
said at the news conference 
on how he would handle the contra situation in light of the 
rebels diminished military capacity bush said i cant give you 
what ill do after i become president but im a strong believer 
that we made a big mistake the congress did in not supporting the 
resistance i would simply take a hard look when i got there 
see what the facts were at the time and try to help the forces 
that want democracy 
bush said he would put his vice president in charge of a 
national antidrug program but when asked what other duties he 
would give him bush said only that it would be a wide area of 
assignments based on the model of the last two administrations 
as to whether the homeless problem might merit special oversight 
by the vice president he replied theres a lot of problems of 
sufficient severity to require the attention of the president and 
vice president whether that means setting up some special 
operation i couldnt possibly say 
bush maintained that he can balance the budget by 1992 under his 
flexible freeze plan to limit federal spenfing to the rate of 
inflation with cuts offsetting each new spending item 
he has listed some areas where he would spend more money 
including education child care and cleaning up the environment 
but has refused to list cuts 
bush conceded that for his idea to work interest rates would 
have to decline by several percentage points from current levels

underdog michael dukakis trying to reverse 
his slide in preelection polls declared in the industrial middle 
west today that republican rival george bush sat on his hands 
while americas industrial heartland has been fighting for its 
life 
in a speech at the north coast brass and copper co the 
democratic presidential nominee said that here in ohio youve 
lost thousands of manufacturing jobs and just last week we learned 
that we had more imports coming into the united states in august 
than in any month in history 
aides said that in the final three weeks of the campaign 
dukakis would sharpen the differences between him and bush 
particularly on economic issues 
dukakis arrived in ohio shortly after publication of a new poll 
by the akron beacon journal which showed him trailing bush in this 
critical state by 11 points 
political aide charles baker dismissed the poll saying the ohio 
electorate is volatile 
ohio he said is winnable baker said dukakis was spending 
a full day in ohio to be followed by a similar allday foray into 
michigan 
the sense is that you want to create a bigger impact on a 
state by putting a lot of attention on it in one day he said 
asked in which major states dukakis is now trailing baker would 
only reply theyre all competitive 
in his euclid speech dukakis said that while bush talks about 
a kinder gentler nation his record contradicts that message 
his record tells the people of ohio we dont care enough 
about you to protect you from the nuclear weapons facilities that 
are poisoning your water and threatening the safety of your 
workers he said 
and im here to tell you that in a dukakisbentsen 
administration well have an energy department that makes sure 
that its citizens and communities are never again threatened by 
nuclear waste and deadly radioactive clouds he said 
on foreign trade dukakis said bush has not given the american 
people a clue as to what he would do mr bushs trade policy is 
like a rerun of lets make a deal letting the voters guess 
whats behind door no 1 door no 2 and door no 3 
the massachusetts governor said he would open the doors of 
foreign markets to american products because i want an america 
more concerned with selling american goods abroad than selling 
american debt abroad 
at a hometown rally in boston on sunday dukakis cast the nov 8 
election as a contest between his middleclass work ethic and 
penthouse republicans who support bush 
i enter the last three weeks of this campaign as an underdog 
fighting for the values i believe in he said 
while the emphasis in boston was on values dukakis aide leslie 
dach said the democratic nominee would concentrate on spelling out 
two different visions of our economic future during appearances 
in ohio michigan and illinois over the next three days 
the close of the campaign is going to be headed by a focus on 
the economic issues said dach 
dukakis told supporters in historic faneuil hall where leaders 
of the american revolution often met that republicans were 
already celebrating theyre popping champagne corks in their 
penthouses but ive got news for those republicans were going to 
be the ones celebrating on election night 
emphasizing the differences between himself and bush the 
democratic nominee said i believe in an america thats in 
command of its destiny and takes charge of its future 
he said the vice president sat on the sidelines for eight 
years while america got beaten in world markets while they 
mortgaged our childrens future to a mountain of debt and a piece 
of america was being sold off every day at bargain basement 
prices 
said dukakis i believe americas leaders must strive to do 
the right thing but we must admit it and correct it when we do 
the wrong thing ive taken responsibility for my mistakes but 
mr bush takes responsibility for nothing 
i believe in the value of work said dukakis while bush 
saw nothing said nothing and did nothing while his republican 
colleagues in the congress used every trick in the book to keep the 
minimum wage a poverty wage 
ask mr bush he went on if he can look a woman in the eye 
who scrubs floors for a living to support her family on 335 an 
hour 
dukakis campaign manager susan estrich and dach denied the 
accuracy of a washington post story on sunday that said he would 
concentrate his efforts on 18 states and the district of columbia 
with 272 electoral votes two more than needed for election 
the list contained most of the major states new york 
california michigan ohio illinois and pennsylvania that both 
sides describe as key battlegrounds 
also on the list were minnesota massachusetts vermont 
connecticut rhode island maryland west virginia the district of 
columbia iowa wisconsin oregon washington and hawaii 
given lower priority according to the post were texas home 
state of democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen and 
new jersey 
it is not accurate said estrich 
we are not writing off whole regions of the country she 
said 
she noted that while the story put georgia and louisiana among 
the states being given less priority dukakis would be in both this 
week

in just 60 seconds george bush transformed 
his prospects in california from a potential landslide loss to 
democrat michael dukakis into a deadheat battle for the states 47 
electoral votes the biggest prize in the presidential election 
that magic minute for bush was comprised of two 30second 
television commercials one attacking dukakis for pollution in 
boston harbor the other focusing on the massachusetts program 
permitting furloughs for prison inmates 
before those commercials began airing on tv stations throughout 
the state dukakis held a strong often doubledigit lead over 
bush among california voters in public opinion polls 
the massachusetts governor had been scoring heavily with strong 
attacks on the reaganbush administrations environmental record 
and with speeches linking the vice president to gen manuel antonio 
noriega whom dukakis described as a drugrunning panamanian 
dictator 
but since the bush campaign began its boston harbor and crime 
commercials the gap between the two candidates has narrowed in the 
nations largest state 
dukakis has counterattacked with a commercial contending that 
it was bushs administration that cut funds to clean up boston 
harbor the spot accused the administration of cutting money 
allocated to clean up the california coast as well 
so when you hear george bush talk about the environment 
remember what he did to the environment the commercial 
concludes dukakis has the support of major environmental 
organizations in california 
the lure of this states 47 electoral votes nearly onesixth 
of the 270 needed for election on nov 8 has brought the state a 
steady stream of campaign visits and an avalanche of money 
california is an integral part of nearly every winning 
scenario said dukakis campaign communications director leslie 
dach 
dukakis has spent 10 days in california since labor day and will 
be in the state at least six more days before election day 
bush has been in the state nine days over the same period and 
also will return before the election he can expect determined help 
here from his chief campaign surrogate president reagan who was 
twice elected governor of california 
steve hopcraft spokesman for dukakis state campaign said at 
least 10 million would be spent in california boosting the 
democratic nominees election 
bush campaign aides were unable to supply a figure but there 
seemed little doubt that the vice presidents backers also were 
spending millions in the state 
weve been sitting in a dead heat for a couple of weeks now 
said bill lacy who is directing the bush effort in california 
we are ahead in this state claims tony podesta lacys 
counterpart with the dukakis campaign but if the massachusetts 
governor is leading it is by the narrowest of margins 
the most recent public poll said dukakis was leading by 4 points 
no state polling data has been available since the final 
presidential debate was held in los angeles on oct 13 but 
national surveys said bush was given the edge in that confrontation 
both campaigns are working hard to build grassroots 
organizations capable of getting out the vote for their candidates 
hopcraft said the dukakis campaign was making 30000 telephone 
contacts nightly to recruit volunteers and would have a leader in 
each of the states 23617 precincts by election day 
lacy said bush phone banks have contacted 600000 voters the 
bush campaign also has the benefit of republican gov george 
deukmejians statewide organization 
lacy said california was too big to be organized simply as 
another state as a result he said the bush campaign has carved 
it into four distinct regions they are the republican heartland in 
such southern counties as orange and ventura the heavily 
democratic san francisco bay area less heavily democratic los 
angeles county and rural areas that are proving to be an important 
battleground in this race 
during bushs most recent appearances on a bus tour of the 
central valley he kept up his attacks on dukakis as a liberal out 
of step with mainstream america 
when you hear those liberals talk the 11 most feared words in 
the english language are im from the federal government and im 
here to help you bush told a rally in stockton the american 
people dont believe that 
before a hispanic audience in pasadena dukakis labeled the 
attacks cynical and accused the reagan administration and the 
vice president of ignoring the concerns of the poor and middle 
class 
we cant take four years of that we cant take four days of 
that he said 
when speaking to hispanics dukakis often lapses into spanish 
which invariably gets a strong positive response hispanics are a 
fastgrowing part of the california electorate but their election 
turnout is lower than among other groups of voters

here is a sampling of what media around the world are saying 
about the us presidential election 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the liberalleaning asahi shimbun of tokyo said monday that 
thursdays debate between republican vice president george bush and 
democratic gov michael dukakis of massachusetts lacked meat 
bush merely reiterated that he would not raise taxes and 
indicated no convincing measure for reducing americas twin 
deficits that have been affecting not only the us economy but 
the global economy as well and dukakis failed to explain how 
he intended to fund his ambitious welfare policy 
we found it most unfortunate that what we consider a 
mudslinging contest believed to have been started by the bush 
camp escalated in this debate and consequently blurred more 
important policy issues and dukakis who is said to be faltering 
apparently tried to recover his ground by pushing harsher measures 
against us trading partners and foreign investors as a means for 
winning voter approval we were alarmed and disturbed by this

siegmund ginzberg reporting from new york for the romebased 
communist party newspaper lunita wrote that bush won the debate 
not with a tko but with boring technique 
bush magisterially prepared by his directors turned out to 
be even in presenting himself with an unchanging manly look 
capable of touching the sentimental feelings of the public dukakis 
instead turned out to appear like an iceberg detached and 
identifying himself with the image of a computer without a

the roman catholic daily ya of madrid said saturday in an 
editorial that bush was leading after the debate it lauded bush 
for upholding the legacy of president reagan including economic 
growth and national prestige 
what can dukakis offer to confront this the commentators 
have concentrated on his qualities as a brilliant intuitive man 
along kennedyesque intellectual lines but they have forgotten that 
these qualities fascinating to europeans are not irresistible to 
american voters who mainly look to their government leaders for 
security efficacy and consistency qualities bush has in good 
supply in addition dukakis is no kennedy

much more calmer and polite bush took every opportunity to 
brand his opponent as a liberal

sen edward m kennedy was honored for his work to 
help gain the release of soviet refuseniks 
action for soviet jewry presented kennedy dmass with its 
freedom award for lobbying the kremlin on behalf of such soviet 
emigrees as benjamin charny and yuri zieman 
the senator told an awards banquet sunday he is encouraged by 
the recent emigration of soviet jews but is cautious about 
indications that several stumbling blocks to emigration may soon be 
dropped 
there is some reason to hope that the soviets will finally 
open the gates of emigration and end the harsh persecution of their 
jewish citizens kennedy said in prepared remarks 
but nothing is certain and as long as teachers of hebrew are 
arrested as long as books of jewish learning are confiscated as 
long as innocent human beings are persecuted because of their 
belief in the god of their fathers none of us can be silent or 
uninvolved

queen elizabeth arrived monday on the 
firstever visit of a reigning british monarch to spain with just 
one obstacle clouding the horizon the rock of gibraltar 
the queen was met at the airport by two relatives crown prince 
felipe and princess elena and drove with them and the duke of 
edinburgh through streets decked with red and yellow spanish flags 
and red blue and white union jacks to el pardo palace the 
residence for state guests on the outskirts of madrid 
there she was received with full military honors by her third 
cousin king juan carlos queen sofia and members of the government 
of socialist prime minister felipe gonzalez 
the fiveday tour which includes trips to seville and barcelona 
and two private days on the mediterranean island of majorca is 
being hailed by the spanish press as the final step in the 
normalization of relations between the two countries that began 
with juan carlos visit to britain in april 1986 and has been 
coaxed along by members of europes two most important royal 
families 
the 62yearold british monarch and the 50yearold spanish king 
are third cousins through britains queen victoria 
press and radio commentators have noted that britain is the only 
country in the world with which spain still maintains a major 
dispute sovereignty over gibraltar 
the rock was ceded to britain by treaty in 1713 when spain lost 
the war of spanish succession 
the queen and juan carlos were expected to talk about gibraltar 
but this will not be a political discussion of course said a 
british source who asked to remain anonymous

nancy reagan has borrowed and returned 
expensive gowns and other clothing used for official functions but 
nothing in the government ethics laws required disclosure of these 
transactions her press secretary said today 
responding to a story in the oct 24 issue of time magazine 
spokeswoman elaine crispen confirmed that the first lady had been 
lent gowns since 1982 white house lawyers agreed in 1982 that any 
borrowed dresses should be considered as loans and reported 
i dont think the law ethics in government act of 1978 
required for those gowns to be reported mrs crispen said 
they have all been returned 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater asked earlier to comment 
on the time report said that president reagan was very upset 
about all these attacks on the first lady 
mrs reagans spokeswoman denied that the first lady had kept 
any of the numerous dresses and matched outfits loaned to her by 
designers 
time said neither the disclosure forms nor reagan tax returns 
from 1982 through 1987 listed loans or gifts of dresses to mrs 
reagan and mrs crispen did not deny that there had been no such 
disclosures she said there had been earlier disclosures but that 
it was subsequently decided that they were not required in 
instances where dresses were returned 
to a typical woman there are some gowns that are so 
spectacular that you would only wear it once she said in a 
telephone interview forget to report them i dont know i 
do know that there was no law broken 
mrs crispen said that there were some disclosures in 1981 
because it was decided to list the dresses borrowed even though 
officials did not believe it was required just to allay any doubt 
about the transactions 
the spokeswoman had said last week that mrs reagan told her she 
has bought all the clothes she has worn since early 1982 according 
to the magazine today mrs crispen amended that to say that she 
considers her personal wardrobe to have been bought there have 
been things that have been borrowed and returned since 1982 
when asked whether an internal inquiry had been commenced in the 
white house counsels office to determine the validity of the 
assertions about mrs reagans use of clothes fitzwater replied 
no at this point i dont know that theres any need for one 
los angeles designer david hayes said mrs reagan has borrowed 
60 to 80 madetoorder outfits during the past eight years she 
returned more than half and kept the others he said 
we think of it as loans its wonderful hayes told time 
she has been a sensation for my business 
an unidentified executive at harry winston jewelers in new york 
city told time that mrs reagan continued to borrow expensive 
accessories including a pair of diamond earrings worth 800000

borrowed jewelry from harry winston jewelers for the 1981 
presidential inaugural and for the wedding of prince charles and 
lady diana later that year 
chris blazakis who works with designer james galanos and is 
writing a book about the reagans said he has identified more than 
300 photographs since 1982 showing mrs reagan wearing outfits he 
estimates are worth a total of more than 1 million retail 
in november 1981 mrs reagan disclosed she had been accepting 
clothing as gifts on jan 14 1982 she announced that she would 
consider dresses accepted in 1981 as loans and would select the 
best and give them to 13 museums 
according to time the museums report that the last such 
donation was in 1982 
mrs crispen said there have been no such museum donations since 
then because mrs reagan returned the dresses to the designers

environmentalists can point to some successes 
in the soontoend 100th congress although efforts to reach 
compromises to strengthen the clean air act proved once again to be 
elusive 
congress enacted legislation to improve the endangered species 
act switch the nations vehicles to alternative fuels and launch 
campaigns against indoor pollution from radon gas and to control 
increasing amounts of improperly discarded medical waste 
but gathering dust along with the clean air bill were proposals 
to give the environmental protection agency more clout over 
hazardous waste generated by other federal agencies and to set 
ground rules for disposing of ash from growing numbers of municipal 
incinerators 
also left undone was one of the reagan administrations more 
controversial landuse proposals to the 100th congress a plan to 
allow petroleum development in the arctic national wildlife refuge 
environmentally the 100th congress began in january 1987 with a 
fiscal battle against the white house over the future of the clean 
water act the law credited with improving the quality of many of 
americas waterways 
a 1986 bill to give local governments 18 billion through 1994 
to build waste water and sewage treatment facilities had been 
pocketvetoed as too costly by president reagan after the 99th 
congress adjourned 
by huge majorities in both chambers the 100th quickly sent the 
same bill to the president who was trying to cut the funding to 
12 billion and vetoed the package a second time 
republicans deserted the white house in droves as the house 
voted 40126 and the senate 8614 to override the second veto 
there was a major element of porkbarrel in the outcome every 
state and virtually every district was in line for a share of the 
money 
while this fight occurred on the front lines the struggle over 
the clean air bill took place in the trenches with neither the 
house nor senate able to bring a proposal to the floor for debate 
led by sen george mitchell dmaine the environment committee 
drafted an ambitious package to attack urban smog acid rain and 
airborne toxic chemicals the administration opposed major portions 
of it and the bills depth and breadth brought it a wide variety 
of industry foes 
mitchell spent much of 1988 trying to unite diverse economic and 
regional interests but abandoned efforts in early october saying 
there was a lack of will to compromise among the environmental and 
industry lobbies 
on the house side a clean air bill never came up for a vote in 
the energy and commerce committee despite efforts by middleground 
members to bring together environmentalist henry waxman dcalif 
and chairman john dingell dmich who opposed waxmans plan to 
clean up auto emissions 
while deadlocked on lowlevel air pollution committees on both 
sides of the capitol were raising their sights with a series of 
hearings on global warming the greenhouse effect that scientists 
say threatens the planet with climate changes and rising sea levels 
legislation was introduced in both chambers to begin clamping 
down on the greenhouse gases that are trapping the suns heat in 
the atmosphere more hearings are planned for the 101st congress 
which will be looking to the new president to exercise leadership 
against a global environmental threat 
on another global issue the senate this year ratified the 
international agreement to reduce emissions of chlorofluorocarbons 
the chemicals said to be destroying the earths vital ozone layer 
the 1987 agreement was largely the result of a worldwide 
diplomatic effort by the reagan administration which for nearly 
eight years has fought congress on many proposals to improve the 
domestic environment 
one exception was the joint work by the administration and 
congress on the recently passed bill to combat radon the naturally 
occurring gas that seeps into buildings and is described as second 
only to cigarette smoking as a cause of lung cancer 
the bill sets a longterm goal of having indoor air as free of 
radon concentrations as the air outdoors it would authorize 30 
million to help states set up radon control programs require epa 
to survey schools for radon and mandate standards for radon 
abatement contractors 
one of the potentially farreaching acts of the 100th congress 
was a plan to switch cars trucks and buses away from gasoline to 
alternative fuels made from coal natural gas and grain 
the legislation attempts to wean the nation away from petroleum 
imports by giving automakers incentives to produce the vehicles 
that are necessary to spur production of alternatives to gasoline 
responding to increasing reports of medical waste washing up on 
shorelines congress recently passed legislation to require epa to 
set up controls to track this sometimes dangerous trash 
the initial program would be geared to connecticut new jersey 
and the eight states bordering the great lakes it could however 
become national in scope because any other state could ask to be 
included

fires threatened a wildlife sanctuary and 
burned closer to a grove of centuriesold giant sequoia trees today 
as three major blazes burned in californias heartland and near 
homestudded mountain ridges surrounding los angeles 
the fires fanned by 30 mph gusts erupted during the weekend as 
an autumn heat wave blasted california with temperatures near 100 
degrees in some areas 
flames burned through more than 4000 acres by this morning in 
the three large blazes and two smaller blazes the largest fire a 
2000plus acre blaze in the angeles national forest challenged 
firefighters trying to protect homes about 30 miles north of los 
angeles 
well either catch it or well chase it said los angeles 
county firefighter stan pearson its burning some areas that 
havent burned in a real long long time 
the fire raging through placerita canyon north of sylmar sent 
a plume of smoke 7000 feet high and two firefighters suffered 
minor injuries battling the blaze authorities said the smoke was 
visible 50 miles away at los angeles international airport and at 
dodger stadium during sundays game 2 of the world series 
the fire moved closer through the night to homes on the 
northeast rim of the san fernando valley but no evacuations were 
ordered us forest service spokeswoman kim vanderhaar said 
they can look out their back yards and see the fire she said 
flames pushing to within a mile of the wildlife way station 
worried workers at the nonprofit refuge for more than 1000 wild 
animals said spokeswoman martine colette adding it was an 
unusally quiet night at the compound 
the lions stopped roaring and the coyotes stopped howling 
they can smell the fire and they are extremely quiet because of 
it she said a dozen water tankers surrounded the facility at 
dawn 
we will have to make our stand here it would not be feasible 
to evacuate the animals she said 
more than 500 firefighters worked through the night to turn the 
blaze as it burned dry brush in highly inaccessible mountainous 
terrain pearson said 
swirling winds sent flames in three different directions 
compounding the effort he said 
three los angeles men accused of starting the blaze with an 
illegal campfire were jailed on 2500 bail said sheriffs lt ed 
chenal he said the blaze appeared accidental 
in sequoia national park a 1000acre fire burned near trees 
more than 2000 years old in the threesquaremile giant forest was 
met by nearly 500 firefighters said us forest service 
spokeswoman michele case 
a successful backfire set to broaden a buffer around the grove 
of what are considered the largest living things on earth gave 
officials hope the area around the majestic trees would not be 
burned she said 
but the giant sequoias themselves are considered relatively 
immune from fires because their bark doesnt burn easily and 
because their branches are so far above the ground experts said 
about 100 campers fled the flames that broke out sunday morning 
in the potwisha camp ground about 30 miles northeast of visalia and 
175 miles north of los angeles 
the fire was blamed on a careless camper ms case said 
an 800acre brush fire in riverside county near hemet burned out 
of control about 85 miles southeast of los angeles but 
firefighters were gaining the upper hand and predicted control 
later today said california department of forestry spokeswoman 
joanne evans 
two smaller fires erupted in the mountainous eastern portion of 
the angeles national forest one a 55acre blaze started by 
children playing with matches and a cigarette lighter destroyed a 
house before it was extinguished firefighters were keeping the 
other one a 150acre fire from crossing a ridge this morning but 
had not contained it authorities said

former white house aide linda chavez said today 
she is quitting as president of us english after being told that 
at least one major contributor to the group has advocated forced 
sterilization 
i am resigning she said to me it is just not consistent 
with the views i hold 
veteran cbs newsman walter cronkite resigned from the groups 
advisory board last week after being told of a 1986 memo by us 
english chairman john tanton that raised the spectre of the united 
states becoming overwhelmed by foreignspeaking havenots 
ms chavez the republican candidate for the us senate from 
maryland in 1986 and a former aide in the reagan administration 
told the associated press last week that she might follow suit if 
tanton did not step down following a weekend board meeting 
on monday she said she had since learned that at least one 
major contributor had helped reprint an awful awful book 
called coup of the saints which she described as a paranoid 
fantasy about undesirables of the third world taking over 
developed nations 
at least one major contributor has given money to groups that 
may be involved in eugenics research she added 
ms chavez did not identify the contributor or contributors 
about whom she was speaking but said she asked tanton whether he 
knew of the contributors other activities he told her he wasnt 
aware of them 
a proposition bankrolled by us english that is on the arizona 
ballot next month would change the arizona constitution to 
designate english as the states official language and limit 
government use of foreign languages in courts meetings and schools 
similar measures are on the ballot in colorado and florida 
ms chavez said she had planned to leave the group anyway 
following the weekend board meeting but decided after hearing about 
the contributors that i dont feel that i wish to wait until 
other details are worked out 
at their meeting in alexandria va the us english board of 
directors decided to review tantons activities in 
immigrationreform and populationcontrol groups and his 1986 memo 
before taking any action 
tanton did not immediately return a call seeking comment and an 
operator at us english in washington said no one else was 
available 
ms chavez said she had sought assurances about the type of 
backers the organization had before she joined it and had given up 
administrative control of us english several weeks ago because 
the organizations financial records werent being kept in 
washington 
i feel that there were some misrepresentations made she 
said in a telephone interview from her home in maryland 
in phoenix a spokesman for opponents of the ballot proposition 
said word of her resignation would help his efforts 
this resignation confirms what we have been saying said 
spokesman perry baker it is hard for anyone to support john 
tanton and proposition 106 when the facts are known one shadowy 
figure from michigan is pushing his grisly vision upon the people 
of arizona 
ms chavez said she still supported the idea behind us english 
and believed the proposition could stand on its own merit no matter 
who supported or opposed it 
supporters of proposition 106 say it would unify the state and 
help minorities join the mainstream more quickly critics claim it 
would disrupt the operation of civil courts englishproficiency 
classes tourism and commerce with other countries

boy scout leaders seeking to ward off child 
molesters are telling their troops in a yell and tell campaign 
that its okay for a scout to be rude and even to holler no if 
someone tries to do something wrong 
the assertiveness training is part of a nationwide youth 
protection training program unveiled this year by the boy scouts of 
america 
we know that perverted individuals seek out youth 
organizations such as scouts choirs and teams what we have done 
is sharpen our scrutiny and make the boy scouts of america very 
uncomfortable for pedophiles said bill kephart denver area 
scouting director 
in his eight years as executive director of denver scouting 
headquarters kephart said he had heard only four official 
complaints of molestation in 24 years of scouting work before that 
he recalls only one complaint he said 
but ted accus spokesman for the boy scouts national 
headquarters in irving texas said at least 100 official 
accusations of sexual assault have been registered in the past 
decade nationwide the program has 15 million leaders operating 
each year 
in the past year explorer scout posts in the denver area have 
been involved in two sexual assault cases 
a former douglas county sheriffs deputy was sentenced in may to 
nine years in prison for sexual assault on a minor three scouts 
testified he used his position to gain their trust and manipulated 
their loyalty to seduce them 
last month a former explorer scout accused a cherry hills 
village patrolman of sexually abusing her in 1984 the case has not 
yet come to trial 
kephart has scheduled a youth protection workshop oct 22 for 
leaders of nearly 150 metroarea explorer scout posts 
effective last month anyone wanting to become a boy scout 
leader must submit an application that lists any drug child abuse 
or other felony charges 
scouting adminstrators also are teaching leaders to avoid being 
accused kephart said 
at one time scout leaders counseling a kid could shut the 
door and sit down to talk with him but now we tell them not to get 
alone with scouts kephart said 
in addition to the ban on oneonone contact new rules require 
that at least two supervising adults accompany outings such as 
campouts 
it is a great dilemma kephart said there are plenty of 
kids out there who really need an arm around their shoulder and 
some affection i dont really think that hugging is completely out 
but if i want to put an arm around a scout who has done well 
i do it in public and standing in the middle of the room

final agreement was reached today on a 
military pact between the united states and the philippines that 
ensures continued us use of crucial pacific air and naval bases 
while boosting american aid to the asian nation 
it is a very important achievement said charles e redman 
the state department spokesman 
he said the agreement would be signed later today by secretary 
of state george p shultz and foreign secretary raul manglapus 
negotiators for the two governments worked on final details 
until a few hours before the ceremony we have reached basic 
agreement redman announced saying no details would be left over 
for negotiators to grapple with later 
the agreement covers use of the two largest us military 
outposts abroad clark air base and subic bay navy base and 
four smaller installations 
on sunday manglus said the pact included 481 million in annual 
payments other us concessions an agreement on nuclear weapons 
and us backing for a bond program aimed at reducing the 
philippines 28 billion debt 
clark and subic are considered vital to regional and western 
security interests across a wide part of the world stretching from 
the pacific to the persian gulf 
the agreement falls far short of the 12 billion that 
philippine sources say manglapus originally wanted manglapus 
however said us and philippine officials were never far apart on 
actual cash compensation in talks that began in april in manila he 
said their disagreements were over us failure to approve benefits 
and concessions that would not require congressional approval 
for five years the philippines has been receiving 180 million 
in annual military and economic aid tied to the bases additional 
us aid has boosted the total to more than 450 million a year 
since philippine president corazon aquino took power in february 
1986 
mrs aquino announced sunday that the signing ceremonies would 
take place in washington she gave no details and us state 
department spokeswoman nancy beck said during the weekend only that 
us officials hoped for a conclusion of the agreement today a 
usphilippines working group continued to iron out technical 
details on sunday 
manglapus however disclosed the broad scope of the agreement 
in a telephone interview 
the pact is expected to lead to talks next year on the longterm 
future of the bases which many filipinos want removed after the 
lease lapses in 1991 mrs aquino has not said whether she supports 
us use of the bases after 1991 any new treaty would have to be 
approved by a twothirds vote of the philippine senate and a 
possible referendum 
failure to conclude the bases review originally scheduled for 
july has delayed reagan administration endorsement of a 5 billion 
multilateral aid program proposed by two republican and two 
democratic members of congress white house sources have said 
president reagan backs the plan but it could not be set up until 
the amount of the base compensation was set 
us officials have not said what the us share of the 
socalled minimarshall plan would be but philippine 
government sources have said 300 million annually has been 
discussed with a like amount expected from japan and the rest from 
other countries 
manglapus said that while the multinational aid plan is separate 
from the bases a new debtrelief portion of the bases pact will 
allow more help from other countries to come in the form of direct 
aid rather than debt relief 
the baseslinked debtrelief plan is a complex arrangement 
calling for the united states to put up us treasury bonds that 
would back a philippine bond issue that initially would be 
exchanged for outstanding debts at 50 cents on the dollar 
manglapus said 
he said the value of the plan to the country would depend on the 
bond market philippine officials previously said they would ask 
that the united states put up 100 million in us treasury bonds 
to back a philippine bond issue 
manglapus said one philippine proposal was to have this come 
from the first installment of the us share in the multinational 
aid plan but he said us officials agreed to an even more 
beneficial arrangement with the money coming from stepped up 
payments of delayed fiscal 1988 and 1989 aid that previously could 
not be used to pay off the debt 
manglapus who came to washington after he and us ambassador 
nicholas platt failed to reach agreement in manila said a us 
pledge to give the philippines title to all improvements on us 
facilities at the bases is an important concession 
the bases were deeded to the philippines under a previous 
agreement but are used by us troops under the pact 
manglapus declined to give details of a nuclear weapons 
agreement he said was in the documents being signed 
the philippine senate has voted to ban nuclear weapons but 
officials in aquinos government have interpreted the law to allow 
the president the last word on whether exceptions might be made in 
the national interest with aquinos agreement this could allow 
the united states to continue its policy of neiher confirming nor 
denying the location of nuclear armaments 
during the politically charged negotiations in manila manglapus 
said the bases were not necessary for philippine security and us 
officials said they could be moved if the philippines demanded too 
much compensation

attacking vigorously with just over three weeks to the election 
george bush said today his democratic rival should stop running 
down our defenses while michael dukakis said bush doesnt care 
enough about people to protect them from nuclearpoisoned water 
far from conceding the presidential race is over despite polls 
showing bush with a lead the two contenders were out campaigning 
early and hard as the week began 
dukakis seeking votes in ohio one of the states it is now 
clear he must win to have a chance on election day said that bush 
as vice president has sat on his hands while americas industrial 
heartland has been fighting for its life 
here in ohio youve lost thousands of manufacturing jobs and 
just last week we learned that we had more imports coming into the 
united states in august than in any month in history dukakis 
said 
he also said that while bush talks about a kinder gentler 
nation his record contradicts that message 
his record tells the people of ohio we dont care enough 
about you to protect you from the nuclear weapons facilities that 
are poisoning your water and threatening the safety of your 
workers dukakis said 
bush meanwhile resumed his attack on dukakis as weak on 
defense 
in remarks prepared for delivery at a denver defense plant bush 
said dukakis is trying desperately to jump into the mainstream 
by talking of a need to modernize landbased defenses 
but there is strong reason to doubt that he would do it 
especially when it comes to modernizing our landbased missiles 
he said 
bush added its time the liberal governor stopped spreading 
what ill call charitably misinformation about the state of our 
forces its not 1980 any more our divisional war fighting 
capabilities have improved by an average of 60 percent sine 1980 
a day earlier bush cautioned against overconfidence and 
promised to stick to his campaign course while dukakis facing an 
uphill struggle in the presidential race nevertheless predicted 
victory on election day 
republican vice presidential nominee dan quayle echoed bushs 
sentiments today saying at a campaign stop in flint mich 
were going to run like were 10 points behind 
the vice president buoyed by polls showing him widening his 
lead over dukakis said sunday that his presidential transition 
team headed by former navy undersecretary chase untermeyer is 
already at work and that he will be ready to name his cabinet 
quickly 
he has drawn up wiring diagrams what we should do if we 
win bush said you have to hit the ground running 
but the gop nominee in his first news conference in more than 
two weeks dismissed suggestions that he has already decided on the 
cabinet members he would choose 
i cant let myself think about that im not going to do 
something that dumb and shift gears bush told reporters in 
denver where he said his campaign will keep on with our original 
game plan keep working hard keep traveling to key states keep 
moving forward 
all i know is to just drive down to the wire he said 
dukakis encouraged by a warm reception from hometown supporters 
in bostons historic faneuil hall described himself as the 
campaigns underdog but warned republicans about toasting success 
three weeks before the election 
the gop is already celebrating theyre popping champagne 
corks in their penthouses the massachusetts governor said but 
ive got news for those republicans were going to be the ones 
celebrating on election night 
on sunday bush promised to follow his campaign strategy with 
the focus on election day not inauguration day and deflected 
questions about his presidential agenda 
i can tell you ive been encouraged certainly not one 
scintilla of overconfidence said bush 
questioned about possible budget cuts to reduce the deficit and 
additional aid to the nicaraguan rebels bush responded im 
having trouble with these questions because they are putting me 
beyond where i want to be so if i dont answer some of them from 
here on in it is because im focusing on november 8 and i dont 
want to be dragged beyond that because things seem to be going well 
now 
on the budget question bush said that he will work it out with 
congress when the time comes you have to sit down and know the 
facts at the time he said 
and on aid to the contra rebels bush said i cant give you 
what ill do after i become president but im a strong believer 
that we made a big mistake the congress did in not supporting the 
resistance 
meanwhile dukakis picked up the editorial support of the st 
petersburg fla times which recommends candidates rather than 
endorses them while bush was backed by three ohio newspapers the 
columbus dispatch the cincinnati enquirer and the elyria 
chronicletelegram 
in his sunday appearance dukakis cast the election as a battle 
between the work ethic of the middle class and the rich republicans 
who support bush 
i believe in the value of work the democratic nominee said 
bush saw nothing said nothing and did nothing while his 
republican colleagues in the congress used every trick in the book 
to keep the minimum wage at poverty level 
ask mr bush dukakis added if he can look a woman in the 
eye who scrubs floors for a living to support her family on 335 
an hour 
dukakis described himself as an underdog fighting for the 
values i believe in

safinaz zulficar who reigned as queen 
farida of egypt for 11 years before being divorced by her husband 
king farouk was buried today after a simple funeral 
farida 67 died on sunday almost two weeks after being 
admitted to a hospital for pneumonia she spent four days in a coma 
before her death 
president hosni mubarak assigned his first chamberlain to join 
about 700 mourners at the funeral although it was not a state 
affair several senior government officials walked at the head of 
the procession 
the funeral was a far cry from farouks nighttime burial in 
cairo without a procession and with only a few of his closest 
family members allowed to attend 
farouk overthrown by the army in 1952 and sent into exile in 
italy died in rome on march 18 1965 at the familys request his 
body was brought to egypt 12 days later and was buried at cairos 
alrifai mosque next to his father king fuad i 
farida arabic for unique was the name farouk decided to give 
his bride after their marriage in 1938 two years after he became 
king he was 18 then she 17 they had three daughters feria 
fawzia and fadia 
what seemingly began as a happy marriage began to crack up after 
farouk started public affairs with other women and frequented night 
clubs and gambling casinos in the mid1940s his popularity dropped 
as scandal involving him became common knowledge 
at the same time farida widely regarded as the wronged 
partner gained in public stature 
women in egypt could not sue for divorce at the time but farida 
demanded a divorce and continued in her efforts despite pressure 
from government officials to dissuade her said alakhbar newspaper

scholars say few people would have been more 
surprised by the pledge of allegiances prominence in the 1988 
presidential campaign than the man who wrote it he was a socialist 
the pledge first appeared in a boston magazine the youths 
companion 96 years ago on sept 8 1892 
although there are competing claims to authorship most 
authorities credit the rev francis bellamy a baptist minister who 
preached against big business and served as vice president of the 
society of christian socialists 
his daughterinlaw rachel bellamy 92 of rochester ny 
recalls him as tall proud and kind of stuffy she said he 
eventually left the ministry because he felt the church was not 
doing enough to help the working man 
louise harris of providence ri who has written two books on 
the history of the pledge believes bellamys congregation grew 
tired of his political homilies one was entitled jesus the 
socialist and forced him out of the pulpit 
in any event bellamy joined the staff of the youths companion 
in 1891 and apparently composed the pledge a few months later 
while the magazine was in the midst of a campaign to sell american 
flags 
the youths companion had pioneered the sale of subscription 
premiums ranging from school uniforms to silver tea services 
but it achieved its greatest commercial success and its enduring 
legacy with its drive to put a flag in every school in the land 
the flags were priced at 330 to 13 depending on size to 
help schools raise the money the magazine provided flag 
certificates that pupils could sell for 10 cents apiece 
starting a year early the youths companion urged school 
children to prepare to celebrate the 400th anniversary of columbus 
voyage to america which was coming up in october 1892 
to show it was truly companionable the magazine even published 
a suggested columbian celebration ceremony most of it just 
happened to require a flag 
sandwiched between a presidential proclamation and an ode to 
columbus both long forgotten was the original 23word pledge 
memorable both for its sentiment and its economy of phrasing i 
pledge allegiance to my flag and to the republic for which it 
stands one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all 
it was not until 1923 that the words my flag were replaced 
by the flag of the united states of america out of concern that 
immigrant children might otherwise think they were pledging 
allegiance to some other flag 
the phrase under god was inserted in 1954 at the behest of 
president eisenhower who said that in this way we shall 
constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be 
our countrys most powerful resource in peace and war 
the original version of the pledge was not signed but once it 
had caught on in the schools rival claims to authorship quickly 
emerged one group pushed for james b upham an editor of the 
youths companion the other favored bellamy 
harris and a few other scholars argue that upham was the author 
but two formal investigations one conducted by the us flag 
association in 1939 and the other by the library of congress in 
1957 concluded that bellamy was responsible 
david whitman a researcher in washington dc says bellamy 
espoused a relatively benign form of socialism 
the nationalist movement which he belonged to wanted to 
nationalize chunks of the american economy but have them controlled 
at the municipal level he did not practice or preach violent 
overthrow of the government by any means whitman said 
controversy over the pledge erupted in the 1940s when jehovahs 
witnesses refused to recite it in the public schools members of 
the sect said swearing allegiance to a material object violated 
their religious principles which dictated allegiance only to god 
the supreme court initially rejected such arguments ruling in a 
1940 case that public schools could expel children who did not 
recite the pledge the court reversed itself in 1943 and said 
children could not be compelled to recite the pledge 
meantime jehovahs witnesses had been subjected to vicious 
attacks in dozens of communities in richwood va for example 
members of the sheriffs department and american legion forced 
seven members of the sect to drink large quantities of castor oil 
then tied them together and paraded them through the town 
bellamy was an avid fan of saying the pledge said whitman 
but i cant imagine how he would have felt about it if he had 
lived to see the mob violence of the 40s

the president of the world jewish congress and 
east german leader erich honecker on monday discussed efforts to 
fight antisemitism 
neither side would comment publicly on a plan for east germany 
to aid holocaust victims 
before the meeting edgar m bronfman said he hoped a final 
decision could be reached during his visit on reparations to jewish 
victims of nazi persecution 
but the staterun news agency adn in several extensive 
dispatches made no mention of discussions about compensation 
bronfman also refused specific comment on the issue saying only 
that the talk was pleasant very warm and very cordial 
we agreed on all the fundamentals he said adding that 
details of the discussions would be announced tuesday 
bronfman has said that an admission of shared responsibility for 
the holocaust was as important as financial contributions to 
victims 
adn said honecker told bronfman of east germanys efforts to 
educate its young people about the horrors of nazi germany 
the struggle against racism and antisemitism belongs to the 
antifascist tradition of east germany honecker was quoted as 
saying we will never forget that many jews together with 
communists and social democrats were active in the struggle 
against the nazi dictatorship 
adn quoted bronfman as telling honecker that i believe that 
today we have built a bridge 
the news agency said bronfman thanked honecker for recent 
government efforts on the part of jews including funding for the 
reconstruction of an east berlin synagogue 
after bronfman arrived sunday he told the associated press he 
believed the east german leadership was sincere in offering 
reparations 
such an agreement would mark a major change in the communist 
nations previous policies 
im optimistic he said what is at stake here is moral 
culpability 
more than 6 million jews were killed during adolf hitlers third 
reich a fact that east germany does not dispute since its 
founding in 1949 however east germany has argued that it bears no 
reponsibility for nazi atrocities because the nation was born after 
world war ii ended 
in past months east german media have reported on government 
efforts to improve relations with east berlins jewish community 
in june east germany said it was willing to provide 
humanitarian aid to jewish survivors of the holocaust but 
negotiations have continued on the reparations themselves 
west berlin jewish leaders have said that east germany has been 
considering paying up to 100 million 
in 1952 west germany signed an agreement with the world jewish 
congress to compensate holocaust victims and families since then 
west germany has paid more than 48 billion to holocaust survivors 
worldwide 
west germany also was founded in 1949 
bronfman also planned to meet with leaders of east berlins tiny 
jewish community before departing tuesday there are an estimated 
450600 practicing jews in east germany

us and argentine warships began 
joint maneuvers monday for the first time in seven years 
the former military junta withdrew from the annual unitas 
maneuvers in 1982 following us support for britain in the war 
over the falkland islands 
defense ministry spokesman horacio altamirano said the exercises 
in the south atlantic are being held to increase the preparedness 
and professionalism of argentine sailors and coordinate 
procedures for aiding ships in distress 
the daily newspaper la nacion reported the us flotilla 
includes the missilecarrying destroyers sampson and nicholson the 
nuclearpowered attack submarine shark and the frigate ws sims 
a spokeswoman for the us embassy said she could not confirm 
the types of us warships the maneuvers are bilateral she said 
and not part of unitas 
the joint maneuvers which end saturday are a sign that 
military relations between the two countries are warming after 
years of tensions 
the military junta that unseated isabel peron in a 1976 coup 
also pulled out of the 1977 and 1978 unitas drills because of 
president jimmy carters criticism of the dictatorships human 
rights abuses 
the attempted reprovisioning of us warships in 1984 at puerto 
madryn 960 miles south of buenos aires sparked public protests 
last month defense minister horacio jaunarena traveled to 
washington at the invitation of defense secretary frank carlucci 
and navy chief adm ramon arosa toured the us aircraft carrier

a gunman who had apparently tried to 
steal 1 million in jewels belonging to the late liberace was shot 
and killed by police when he fled the entertainers museum with a 
74yearold hostage authorities and witnesses said 
the dead man was identified as hugh perry 47 of las vegas 
metro police lt kyle edwards said perry had a lengthy arrest 
record dating back to the 1960s 
hostage margaret bloomberg who had worked at the museum 10 
years was not injured she was able to give the police the 
opportunity to shoot the gunman by sitting on the sidewalk as if 
her legs had buckled underneath her 
the museum is one of the citys top tourist attractions 
featuring memorabilia of the entertainer who gained fame here and 
retained a home not far from the las vegas strip 
liberace died in february 1987 of complications due to aids 
mrs bloomberg said she was just closing the office sunday when 
the suspect appeared saying he wanted to deliver a plant the man 
produced a gun forced his way into the museum and refused offers 
of money she said another worker was able to summon police she 
said 
dora liberace sisterinlaw of the entertainer and 
administrator of the museum said the man carried a bag of tools 
including a crowbar and obviously intended to break into a case 
displaying 1 million in jewelry owned by liberace ms liberace 
arrived at the museum shortly after the shooting occurred 
when perry spotted police he forced mrs bloomberg out the 
front door at gunpoint and made his way toward a car he had driven 
to the scene officials said 
mrs bloomberg just sat down on the sidewalk pretending her 
legs had collapsed under her mrs liberace said he tried to 
lift her in the car but couldnt he leaned back for a minute and 
the police shot him 
when i sat down i figured the police would pick him off 
maybe mrs bloomberg said 
john sullivan deputy chief of detectives said the man 
threatened mrs bloomberg and she started to resist while he 
tried to force her into a car 
she fell to the ground and an officer shot perry with one

business inventories continued their steady 
rise in august the government said monday but economists remain 
untroubled because the expansion is not outpacing strong sales 
the commerce department said goods held on shelves and backlots 
rose 08 percent to 7337 billion following a 07 percent gain in 
july it was the 20th consecutive monthly increase 
rising inventories can be a sign of economic sluggishness as 
manufacturers order production cuts and layoffs while goods in 
reserve are sold off 
however analysts are not particularly troubled by current 
inventory levels because sales also have been strong compared with 
a year ago inventories are up 87 percent while sales are up 80 
percent 
the department said august sales totaled 4877 billion up a 
brisk 11 percent from july when the gain was a slight 01 
percent it was the ninth increase in a row 
if were looking for a reason for a slowdown in 1989 it wont 
be excess inventory building typically recessions develop when 
there are excess levels of inventory and were not looking at those 
levels this year said john hagens an economist with the wefa 
group a bala cynwyd pa forecasting firm 
inventory accumulation in august was led by a 14 percent rise 
at retailers where sales are the slowest wholesale inventories 
were up 06 percent while inventories at factories where an export 
boom has kept sales strongest increased 05 percent 
however half of the inventory buildup among retailers is 
accounted for by a 29 percent rise at auto dealers car sales have 
been strong this year so dealers did not offer price cuts or 
financing incentives to move cars from the old model year off their 
lots 
inventories are in pretty good shape with the notable 
exception of apparel said maury n harris an economist with 
painewebber inc however the overall inventory level wont 
remain in good shape unless retail sales pick up in october and 
november but i think they will 
in sales a 21 percent increase at manufacturing plants more 
than offset a 01 percent decline at the retail level wholesalers 
reported a 07 percent increase 
an advance estimate of retail sales for september released last 
week showed a 04 percent decline 
the combination of moderately strong gain in inventories and an 
even more robust sales increase left the inventorytosales ratio 
at 150 unchanged from july and june and up slightly from 149 a 
year ago that means it would take 15 months to exhaust 
inventories at the august sales pace a ratio not considered 
unusually high

two sikhs sentenced to death for the 
1984 assassination of prime minister indira gandhi wont be 
executed until the president rules on a petition for mercy news 
reports said monday 
the executions of satwant singh and kehar singh were scheduled 
for oct 19 but will be delayed until president ramaswamy 
venkataraman rules on the mercy plea the united news of india 
reported 
the news agency quoting an unidentified governement spokesman 
said a new date for the executions would be announced if the 
petition is rejected 
the mercy plea was filed by kehar singh 54 but both executions 
will be stayed the agency said satwant singh 24 has refused to 
file a similar plea 
the announcement of the postponement came hours after two courts 
declined to stay the hanging of the two men 
the delhi high court rejected a petition for the stay until 
police investigate a complaint filed by satwant singh that security 
guards shot at him after disarming him following mrs gandhis 
assassination the press trust of india said 
a magistrates court in new delhi another court where satwants 
complain was being heard also rejected a plea to delay the 
execution 
both courts said they had no jurisdiction to stay the hanging 
after it was upheld by the supreme court 
the petition also noted authorities recently arrested a sikh 
terrorist who allegedly helped plan mrs gandhis murder and an 
investigation was pending the report said 
mrs gandhi was shot and killed in the garden of her new delhi 
home on oct 31 1984 by two of her sikh bodyguards satwant singh 
and beant singh 
the two men are not related sikhs by doctrine of their faith 
take the name singh which means lion 
mrs gandhi apparently was murdered in revenge for an army raid 
she ordered four months earlier on the golden temple the sikhs 
holiest shrine in the northern city of amritsar more than 1200 
people died in the attack most of them sikhs 
satwant singh and beant singh were shot by other security guards 
moments after the assassination and beant singh later died of 
bullet wounds 
beant singhs maternal uncle kehar singh was arrested a month 
later and charged with conspiracy in the assassination 
satwant singh and kehar singh were convicted and sentenced to 
death by hanging in january 1986 after an eightmonth trial in new 
delhi 
the delhi high court and the supreme court upheld the 
convictions and death sentences 
the supreme court on aug 3 overturned the death sentence of a 
third man balbir singh ruling there was insufficient evidence to 
prove he participated in the conspiracy 
a district judge wednesday authorized the execution of satwant 
singh and kehar singh who are being held at new delhis

officials said 
lights flickered across the salt lake valley when the

a space shuttle main rocket engine will 
be testfired wednesday at the marshall space flight center the 
first extended firing since the roar of saturn rockets echoed 
across huntsville in the 1960s 
its going to be something huntsville hasnt heard for quite 
awhile marshall spokesman dom amatore said 
the 15second firing is part of a series of tests on the shuttle 
main engines and coincides with the citys space awareness week 
nasa engineers want to determine how long the rocket motors 
fueled by hydrogen and oxygen from the shuttles huge external 
tank can run if needed the engines now operate for about eight 
minutes during a shuttle launch 
shuttle engine no 0208 installed in the test stand in august 
was warmed up in a 15second start test last month 
after this weeks test a third test firing of 45 seconds will 
be scheduled in november amatore said the primary goal of the 
first brief tests is to verify that marshall can handle the firings 
and whether a metal flame bucket on the test stand can handle 
the rocket exhaust 
the last test firing of a big rocket motor at marshall was a 
saturn test on sept 11 1969 about two months after men first set 
foot on the moon 
marshall is nasas main propulsion center in addition to 
developing the saturn rockets it manages space shuttle propulsion 
systems including the main engines and solid fuel booster rockets 
which are testfired in utah 
space awareness week includes a visit by the crew of the 
shuttle discovery 
the five astronaunts who flew last month in the first 
postchallenger shuttle mission are to be in huntsville on thursday 
and friday to thank marshall engineers 
they also will lead a parade and appear at a public reception 
thursday 
on wednesday singer john denver and former new mexico senator 
and apollo astronaut harrison schmitt will be in town to discuss 
proposed new space missions 
denver who hopes to ride into orbit with a soviet crew in 1990 
will talk about earth observation missions while schmitt will 
discuss proposals for manned missions to the moon and mars

the strain on us industrial capacity eased 
in september for the first time in seven months as utilities scaled 
back after the summer heat wave the government said monday 
the federal reserve board said the overall operating rate last 
month at us factories mines and utilities fell to 836 percent 
of capacity down 02 percentage points from august 
in july the rate also was 838 percent soaring to an 
eightyear high from 830 percent in june as utilities produced 
more electricity to run air conditioners 
utility operating rates fell from 836 percent in august to 799 
percent last month while electric utilities fell from 881 percent 
to 835 percent 
utilities had their big surge in july and august and then they 
came back to normal said robert g dederick an economist with 
northern trust co in chicago 
the relevant thing is what went on in the manufacturing 
sector there i think we can say the pressure on resources 
hasnt worsened but it still remains relatively high and therefore 
any easing of inflation pressures is unlikely he said 
the operating rate at manufacturing plants held steady at 838 
percent the same as august and down slightly from 839 percent in 
july the most recent peak 
economists have expressed concern that high factory operating 
rates and a tight labor market are exerting inflationary pressure 
on the economy if overall operating rates get too high overworked 
factories can have trouble meeting demand leading to higher prices 
capacity use at manufacturers of durable goods big ticket 
items expected to last three or more years edged up 01 percentage 
points to 824 percent while the rate for nondurable goods edged 
down by the same amount to 858 percent 
the largest increase came at auto assembly plants where the 
operating rate rose 36 percentage points to 740 percent 
the overall level of capacity utilization doesnt signal as 
much price pressure as it might because the hot industries are 
cooling and the cool industries are speeding up said john 
hagens an economist for the wefa group a bala cynwyd pa 
forecasting firm 
two areas of particular tightness paper and textiles have 
cooled from levels a year ago capacity use among paper 
manufacturers was 938 percent in august the latest month 
available down from 957 percent in september 1987 the rate for 
textiles has eased from 936 percent to 891 percent in august 
the rate for the mining sector which includes oil and gas 
drilling rebounded to 831 percent last month up from 828 
percent in august but still below the 832 percent july rate

us companies operating abroad do not have 
to comply with the civil rights law forbidding discrimination on 
the job a federal appeals court ruled monday 
the 21 ruling by the 5th us circuit court of appeals upheld a 
lower court ruling against ali boureslan a naturalized us 
citizen who was born in lebanon and employed by aramco in dhahran 
saudi arabia 
he filed suit under title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 
contending that he was fired in june 1984 after a harassment 
campaign by his supervisor a campaign which took the form of 
racial religious and ethnic slurs the 5th circuit said 
the sevenpage majority ruling by judge eugene davis said the 
court could not find any indication in the law or in its 
legislative history that congress had meant to extend civil rights 
protection to us citizens employed abroad 
arguments that it is unfair to deny americans employed abroad 
protections to which they are entitled in this country are 
appealing but do not overcome other strong policy arguments davis 
wrote 
the religious and social customs practiced in many countries 
are wholly at odds with those of this country the ruling said 
requiring american employers to comply with title vii in such a 
country could well leave american corporations the difficult choice 
of either refusing to employ united states in the country or 
discontinuing business 
in a strong 17page dissent judge carolyn dineen king said it 
may be necessary to enforce the law abroad to be sure that 
minorities and women have an equal chance at home 
todays decision means that one us citizen assigned to the 
saudi office of a us corporation and another us citizen 
working for the same company in texas could experience identical 
acts of discrimination but only the latter will have a remedy 
this situation creates a dilemma for minorities and women foreign 
assignments will be less attractive while refusal of such an 
assignment could limit an individuals opportunity for 
advancement she wrote 
she noted that assignement to a foreign office is frequently a 
required step for promotion within a multinational corporation 
this means she said that this country may have to enforce its 
civil rights laws abroad to ensure equal chances at foreign 
assignments that would affect employment opportunities in the 
united states 
her dissent agreed with other arguments brought up by boureslan 
and the equal employment opportunities commission which entered a 
friendofthecourt brief 
they argued that a section exempting aliens working for us 
corporations in other countries showed that congress did intend it 
to apply to us citizens under such circumstances

the soviet union has built a quieter more 
economical passenger jet the communist party newspaper pravda 
reported monday 
the tupolev204 which can carry 214 passengers and has a range 
of 2480 miles will undergo flight trials this year and be 
introduced into service by the staterun carrier aeroflot in 1990 
pravda said 
alexei tupolev head of the tupolev design bureau said the goal 
was to create a plane that would consume less fuel and be cheaper 
to operate pravda said aircraft builders believe the tu204 will 
be the most economical soviet plane in its class

republican dan quayle grabbed a 
democratic line monday as he campaigned in the industrial midwest 
pledging good jobs at good wages 
in a series of stops across michigan where the presidential 
race is considered close quayle stressed economic themes even 
using some phrases that sounded more like democrat michael dukakis 
than the leader of quayles own ticket george bush 
when we talk about the future were talking about jobs and 
opportunity quayle told thousands of cheering high school 
students in flint im talking about good jobs and im talking 
about good jobs at good wages 
the good jobsgood wages line has been a staple in dukakis 
campaign speeches for months 
as for the election quayle said the republicans would ignore 
polls showing them ahead with three weeks to go 
it is down to the wire time he said we all think its 
going to be very competitive were going to run like were 10 
points behind 
in a state where the auto industry has been hardhit by foreign 
competition quayle said we are talking about fair free trade 
without resorting to protectionist barriers 
later in the day quayle was traveling to mount pleasant 
traverse city and gaylord elsewhere in michigan 
quayle an indiana senator appealed to regional pride at 
various stops where he was greeted by enthusiastic crowds inside 
and knots of protesters outside 
that man from massachusetts may look down on us in middle 
america but come election day theyll be looking up to george 
bush he said us midwesterners have to stick together 
quayle appreared relaxed and upbeat as he swung across the 
state surprising customers with an appearance at a fastfood 
restaurant and occasionally joking with reporters on his campaign 
plane 
questioned outside one stop quayle said that he was very 
close personally with presidential standardbearer george bush but 
that joint appearances by the two would be a little bit 
counterproductive 
i wouldnt ask for it quayle said i want him to cover 
his part of the country and i want to cover my part of the 
country 
in his remarks to the students quayle said my goal is the 
same goal you have and that is a drugfree america 
when you have a drug kingpin involved in murder that person 
is going to get the death penalty he said it may sound harsh 
but those people are peddling and are merchants of death when 
theyre going to murder our children and put poison in their veins 
yes capital punishment is an appropriate response 
quayle who said last week that he had complained to bush 
campaign chairman james baker iii about anonymous criticism of him 
from campaign officials said they had had a very upbeat talk 
asked if baker had offered him any advice for the final three 
weeks of the campaign quayle said no i gave him my advice 
as he started his campaign day quayle dropped in at a burger 
king surprising a handful of customers 
he apologized for disturbing the relative tranquility of the 
place as a crowd of reporters and photographers climbed over booths 
you were sitting here nice and quiet and we ruined it he 
said 
but he left with an exhortation tell them george bush and i 
will work hard for you

a giant fern so rare in the united states 
that biologists had refused to reveal its whereabouts for fear it 
would be wiped out now faces extinction anyway because of a 
proposed development 
in the continental united states the cuplet fern grows only in 
two small swampy spots a halfmile apart in the black hammock a 
7680acre wetlands area about 10 miles northeast of orlando 
identified in 1802 the fern used to grow on the southern edge 
of lake okeechobee but was plowed under for farmland decades ago 
the fern dennstaedtia bipinnata also is found in the carribean 
and south america 
its a fern thats over your head you can stand under it 
said david hardin a research ecologist for the florida natural 
areas inventory when you get out in a clump of these giant ferns 
you feel like youre out in the tropics 
but a tiny piece of the black hammock attracted the interest of 
a retired priest the rev john caulfield of lakeland and he and 
another priest bought 40 acres and planned to sell it off in 
fiveacre lots 
the st johns river water management district discovered 
caulfields plans 13 months ago when he had a road cut through the 
wetlands south of lake jesup without a drainage permit 
the road and the small development would bode most ill for the 
fern said peggy lantz who edits publications for the florida 
native plant society and the florida audubon society 
hank whittier a university of central florida biology professor 
who takes students on fern tours says even cutting down trees 
nearby could let in light and cold wind that could change the 
ferns special climate 
whittier has transplanted a few ferns to the universitys 
arboretum but they arent as robust outside their native habitat 
the water district regulatory agency planned to fine caulfield 
1000 and make him plant trees where the road was cut but 
caulfield has applied for an afterthefact permit to build the 
quartermile road and develop eight lots he already has sold two 
the water management district says caulfield is trying to figure 
out a way to develop his property and protect the fern 
the water district also is considering several ways to protect 
the fern said pat frost the districts field office director in 
orlando 
it will be difficult for caulfield to convince the district that 
he can develop the property without damaging the wetlands frost 
said 
we recognize the fern as a valuable resource and we would be 
remiss to not even address it frost said 
but the longterm outlook is not good the entire black hammock 
is slowly being nibbled away by turf farms vegetable farms tree 
nurseries and rural homes whittier said

rep pat swindall was indicted today on charges 
of perjury accused of lying to a federal grand jury investigating 
money laundering 
us attorney robert barr said swindall a republican was 
indicted on 10 counts of perjury over his testimony before a grand 
jury last february about a sting in which a federal agent posed as 
a money launderer 
swindalls office said today he had no immediate response to the 
announcement but he had said sunday during a television 
interview that he expected to be indicted and was glad because he 
hoped it would give him a chance to clear his name before his 
reelection bid goes to the voters nov 8 
in an unusually bitter race swindall 47 is seeking a third 
term from suburban atlantas 4th district against democratic 
opponent ben jones 46 a former actor on televisions dukes of 
hazzard who lost to swindall in 1986 
jones has criticized swindall ever since the 
moneylaunderingrelated charges were first aired while swindall 
has assailed jones past conviction on a charge of wifebeating a 
conviction jones says stemmed from alcohol abuse that he has since 
overcome 
in sundays interview swindall said he expected to be arraigned 
this afternoon and planned to waive a number of rights including 
the right to charge the government with misconduct in the case so 
that he can go on trial next monday barr said he did not know 
whether such a quick trial would be possible 
swindall said he planned to represent himself at the trial 
i am actually excited because it will be the first opportunity 
i am going to have to clear the air clear my name and give the 
voters a legitimate race based on the issues swindall said in 
the interview sunday 
angered by continued reports linking his name with the grand 
jury investigation swindall took the house floor on oct 3 to 
demand an immediate indictment 
barr said the timing of the indictment has nothing whatsoever 
to do with politics or swindalls request to be indicted 
swindall was first linked publicly to the money laundering 
investigation earlier this year when it was disclosed that his aug 
28 1987 meeting with an undercover federal agent posing as a 
money launderer for underworld figures had been videotaped 
money laundering is a term for various methods of getting 
around federal currency laws by transferring illicitly raised cash 
drug money for example into bank accounts in such a way that 
its origin is hid 
swindall was introduced to the undercover agent by charles 
lechasney a former atlanta businessman who was active in 
republican circles lechasney is one of the two men scheduled to go 
on trial next week on moneylaundering charges 
lechasney and several swindall aides testified before the grand 
jury last month swindall testified before the grand jury in 
february 
in june atlanta newspapers obtained several tape recordings 
from the investigation and published excerpts from a series of 
conversations between swindall lechasney and the undercover agent 
the tapes showed that swindall continued to pursue negotiations 
for an 850000 home construction loan after being told it might be 
financed with drug money he would be helping to launder 
swindall was quoted on the tapes as saying that the source of 
the money was charles problem since lechasney would be 
obtaining the money to lend to swindall he added i frankly 
dont think its incumbent upon me to go out and find out where xyz 
corp gets their money or for that matter where chrysler corp 
gets their money if they set back the odometer thats their 
problem 
he ended the negotiations after being told he would have to 
accept the money in person in cash and sign a receipt 
swindall later apologized for his role in the negotiations 
calling it a mistake in judgment but he denied any wrongdoing 
he also asked the house ethics committee to determine if he had 
violated any law or house rule the panel agreed to investigate 
but has not issued a ruling 
the indictment said swindall lied when he told the grand jury 
last february that he did not have any concrete indication that 
lechasney and the undercover agent were discussing illegal 
activities 
swindall testified that he was suspicious of the agent but did 
not have enough information to report the matter to authorities 
the indictment said 
another count of the indictment accuses swindall of lying when 
he denied the agent discussed keeping the large cash loan from 
being reported to federal regulators

more than 200 miners staged a protest 
rally outside gov arch moores office monday complaining about 
the states black lung fund and urging that he fire his energy 
commissioner 
moore finally appeared with a state police escort and walked 
through the demonstrators greeting some and shaking hands 
none in the crowd tried to confront moore with the demands 
which were a mixed bag of complaints about commissioner ken 
faerber a 30 million loan from the black lung fund made last 
fiscal year and workers compensation commissioner nelson 
robinson who oversees the black lung fund 
the rally was called by the coal miners political action 
committee the political arm of the umw the committee has endorsed 
moores opponent in the governors race democrat gaston caperton 
i think its nice they express themselves moore said when 
asked about the protest and i would hope its sincere 
just after the rally and in the opposite wing of the capitol 
the state supreme court agreed to consider a petition filed last 
week by umw president richard trumka against faerber and moore the 
petition said faerber and moore have interfered with the operations 
of the board of coal mine health and safety which is supposed to 
review each mine fatality and issue regulations if needed to 
prevent a recurrence 
the court unanimously set arguments for nov 2 six days before 
the election 
faerber denied interfering with the board and said the suit was 
politically inspired 
wheres arch the crowd chanted during the protest outside 
the governors office where is moore we will not be moved 
charles whited of chesapeake who said he was part of the black 
lung disabled workers organization said the miners were angry 
because of a high death rate in the states mines and because 30 
million was borrowed from the miners black lung fund to help keep 
state government afloat last fiscal year 
but faerber said last years mine death rate of nine was the 
lowest in state history he said 10 miners have died this year 
in addition the black lung loan was made by the legislature 
not the governors office although moore supported it with the 
concurrence of the umw leadership

political extremist lyndon h larouche 
jr and six codefendants pleaded innocent monday to federal fraud 
and conspiracy charges in connection with alleged loans to his 
enterprises 
in an arraignment lasting less than 10 minutes larouche and his 
associates spoke only once to swear i do to a promise to 
return to court for trial nov 21 and for a hearing on a motion 
nov 10 
us district judge albert v bryan jr speeded the proceeding 
by saying that he assumed that all the defendants were pleading 
innocent and asking for a jury trial their lawyers nodded 
agreement 
larouche was more vocal at a news conference in washington 
earlier monday calling the indictment a heap of garbage and 
asserting im certainly not guilty 
this is purely a political stunt the 66yearold 
independent candidate for president said nebulous charges never 
occur this close to an election except as a dirty trick 
larouche was indicted in alexandria last friday on 13 counts of 
mail fraud conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to 
defraud the internal revenue service conviction on all counts 
carries a prison term of 65 years and fines of 325 million 
six of his associates also were charged and face lesser 
sentences if convicted the grand jury said their scheme raised 
more than 34 million in loans to larouches political and 
commercial groups from individuals nationwide between 1983 and 1987 
with no intention of repaying them 
the indictment said larouche conspired to defraud irs by having 
his expenses paid by friends and groups associated with him it 
added that he has not filed a federal income tax return since at 
least 1979 
this is a screwball charge larouche said the government 
does not charge i evaded taxes because i have made clear i have no 
money income he said he relied on the gifts of friends and being 
hosted by various organizations and conferences there is no 
tax liability 
larouche added i had nothing to do with raising 34 
million he said he had counseled some groups but never had 
authority over them and that the central organization described in 
the indictment does not exist 
this is a malicious vindictive prosecution he said 
larouche who is campaigning in 12 states and the district of 
columbia said he believed that democratic presidential nominee 
michael dukakis prevailed on likeminded federal prosecutors in the 
reagan administration to seek the indictment because larouche has 
predicted dire consequences if dukakis is elected 
us attorney henry hudson said last friday that larouche was 
being treated like any other citizen accused of a crime 
the seven defendants were all released on their own personal 
recognizance but pledged to pay 5000 if they fail to appear for 
court dates 
judge bryan allowed them unlimited travel in the united states 
and abroad so long as they informed the court clerk in advance 
assistant us attorney kent robinson had objected to international 
travel but was overruled 
bryan made clear he plans to move the case quickly saying 90 
percent of the defense motions in this case are going to come 
straight out of the word processor and only two or three or four 
will require serious thought the rest i can recite by heart 
an earlier federal trial of larouche and other associates in 
boston ended in a mistrial because jurors objected to the length of 
the case the boston case is scheduled for retrial in january 
larouches codefendants in virginia are his fundraising chief 
william wertz his chief legal adviser edward spannaus and four 
fundraisers michael billington dennis small paul greenberg and 
joyce rubinstein

a homegrown ballet company is hopping 
mad over the citys invitation to the cincinnati ballet 
particularly since the larger company will perform the 
nutcracker a week before its own version 
we feel terrified cheryl van metre artistic director of 
the local appalachian ballet company said monday i hate to be 
in competition with them it boils down to having money 
the knoxville arts council has welcomed a plan to have the 
cincinnati ballet come south for the fallwinter season each year 
as city ballet the council says its a great way to bring 
professional bigcity ballet to this east tennessee city of 
180000 
the smaller company though fears losing the audience for its 
breadandbutter production the popular christmas classic 
choreographed to tchaikovskys nutcracker suite its nutcracker 
is scheduled dec 4 a week after the cincinnati ballets 
we are a semiprofessional group of local dancers and weve 
performed in knoxville and all the surrounding areas for 11 
years said ms van metre who studied at londons royal ballet 
before returning home to knoxville nutcracker makes the most 
amount of profit for us this is how we make our money to exist 
in addition to receiving grant money she said 
her company she adds contributes to the community by bringing 
ballet to public schools across an area often associated with buck 
dancing and bluegrass music 
carol hicks project director for city ballet acknowledged the 
struggle that the appalachian ballet has on its hands but said 
there was little anyone could do 
our feeling is that were bringing in a different caliber of 
dance she said this is an opportunity for knoxville to have a 
worldrenown dance troupe 
its regrettable i know its going to be a thorn in their 
side weve asked them to come to our meetings to talk about 
things she said

the government is losing billions of dollars 
in tax revenues each year because the internal revenue service does 
not use an enforcement program on business taxpayers that it has 
been using effectively on individuals a house panel said monday 
a report from the house government operations subcommittee on 
commerce consumer and monetary affairs estimated that between 32 
billion and 8 billion a year in taxes on interest and dividends 
earned by businesses is never collected because the income is not 
reported to the irs 
while the revenue loss estimates are not statistically 
precise the report said they provide ample justification for the 
irs to include businesses in the documentmatching program it now 
uses to verify interest and dividend earnings on individual tax 
returns 
under the existing documentmatching program the irs compares 
information returns detailing interest and dividend payments to 
individuals with the individuals actual income tax returns the 
program in fiscal 1985 produced 235 billion in additional tax 
revenue from individuals 
although banks and corporations are not required to file such 
information returns on income payments to corporations the house 
report said the irs received but never used 26 million such 
returns in 1985 showing income payments to 5 million businesses 
totaling 987 billion 
by casting these information returns aside irs is not only 
missing the chance to assess many billions of dollars of unreported 
business tax liabilities but has created a double standard of 
enforcement that is more lenient by far toward businesses than 
individuals said rep doug barnard dga chairman of the 
subcommittee 
irs spokesman frank keith said monday the agency has not seen 
the house report and will have no comment until agecny officials 
can review it 
but at a hearing before barnards subcommittee last year irs 
commissioner lawrence b gibbs said the costs of implementing a 
documentmatching program for corporations would not be justified 
by the additional revenue that would be generated 
gibbs said the administrative costs of a documentmatching 
program for corporations would be much higher than for individuals 
because corporations use different fiscal years varying accounting 
methods and different names 
although the problems cited by gibbs all pertain to the way 
income is reported to the irs the house report said the irs 
never considered the desirably of modifying the reporting 
requirements nor assessed the feasibility of a partial 
documentmatching program encompassing those corporations to which 
the difficulties do not pertain 
gibbs told the subcommittee last year the irs would begin using 
documentmatching to verify income reported on tax returns from 
singleowner businesses and would initiate a multiyear study to 
determine the extent of business underreporting of interest and 
dividend income 
he also promised to begin a test program using information 
returns to detect corporations and partnerships that do not file 
any income tax return 
the house report said the test program in one district office 
was so effective the irs now has expanded it to nine more districts 
and could have a documentmatching program ready by next spring to 
identify nonfilers among corporations and partnerships nationwide 
but despite such efforts barnard said the irs has not been 
sufficiently diligent in attempting to extend its sophisticated 
computer matching capabilities to businesses 
individuals and now sole proprietors who know that each and 
every one of their returns will be scrutinized by irs computers 
for unreported income deserve to know why corporate and partnership 
returns are being excused from this automatic examination 
process barnard said 
the report said congress should help the irs set up a 
documentmatching program for corporate returns by enacting 
legislation to require that businesses and financial institutions 
report to the irs all dividend and interest payments to 
corporations 
barnard introduced such legislation earlier this year but it 
was never reported out of the house ways and means committee

the antarctic ozone hole which has raised 
scientific concern in recent years seems to have moderated 
slightly the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
reported monday 
the socalled hole is a depletion in the amount of ozone high in 
the atmosphere over the south pole region some scientists also 
have found indications of a similar north pole depletion 
this phenomenon was detected in the early 1980s and raised 
concern because ozone a form of oxygen helps block harmful 
ultraviolet radiation from the sun that radiation has been 
associated with skin cancer 
instruments sent up in balloons have found that the amount of 
ozone in the air above antarctica this month averaged 200 dobson 
units 
by comparison measurements averaged 135 dobson units last 
october and 165 the october before they were as high as 250 units 
in 1980 
the dobson unit is a measurement of ozone made by comparing how 
much of each of two wavelengths of sunlight is absorbed in the air 
that ratio changes depending on the concentration of ozone 
october which marks springtime in the antarctic is the time of 
year when ozone is most depleted over the area according to walter 
komhyr of noaas environmental research laboratories in boulder 
colo 
however the apparent improvement does not mean the threat of 
ozone depletion is reduced komhyr said 
rather it seems to indicate that natural variations in the 
atmosphere can lead to large yeartoyear changes in ozone he said 
the ozone hole occurs within a vortex of westtoeast winds 
which tend to circle the antarctic during the winter and spring 
months 
this year komhyr noted the temperatures high in the atmosphere 
have been a few degrees warmer than during the last two years 
the warmer temperatures reduce the formation of clouds in the 
stratosphere and that may be helping protect the ozone it is 
within those clouds that chlorine compounds tend to do the most 
damage to ozone komhyr explained 
reducing the release of chlorine compounds has become a major 
focus in recent years they are largely derived from 
chlorofluorocarbons manmade gases used in refrigeration 
industrial processes and as aerosol propellants in some countries

only one of six fouryear colleges in the 
united states requires that all students getting degrees study a 
foreign language the american council on education reported monday 
the same proportion has raised its foreign language requirement 
over the past five years 
foreign language requirements in other countries are 
considerably heavier it takes seven years of english to graduate 
from an israeli high school for example 
a study by charles j andersen jr senior research associate 
for the council found that about one in eight of the colleges 13 
percent requires some foreign language study of all applicants 
one in 12 increased its requirement between 1982 and 1987 
there was much less interest in languages among twoyear 
community colleges which are more oriented toward getting jobs for 
their graduates only 1 percent required any foreign language study 
as a condition of entrance and only about 13 percent required any 
further instruction for the associate degrees they usually grant 
the survey was based on replies from nearly 400 of more than 
3200 institutions listed by the us department of education 
richard brod who does similar studies for the modern language 
association said in a telephone interview that requirements have 
been increasing since the late 1970s or early 1980s he said the 
trend is based on a recognition of a need for competitiveness 
against rivalry from other countries 
language requirements here were much heavier before world war 
ii when a smaller proportion of high school graduates went on to 
college 
there was a loosening in the 1950s and 1960s brod said 
then there was a revival based partly on the soviets sending up 
the first sputnik space satellite 
brod found language study reaching a peak in 196566 and then 
declining again now enrollments in foreign language classes are 
increasing at a time when enrollments in general are only holding 
steady he said 
the council study also found 
77 percent of all fouryear colleges require students to take 
at least one internationallyoriented course such as western 
history or world civilization 
63 percent of the colleges had programs permitting study in 
other countries 
85 percent reported at least some foreign publications in their 
libraries among twoyear colleges 32 percent said they had none 
at all 
nearly half the fouryear colleges increased the number of 
foreign students in the past five years more than half increased 
the number of international courses hired new faculty with 
knowledge of international affairs and increased the size of the 
international collections in their libraries

sudan is working with the united nations 
and the world bank to raise nearly half a billion dollars urgently 
needed to save millions of hungry people displaced by floods and 
war 
the united nations plans a worldwide appeal for immediate 
donations totaling 50 million to care for 2 million people 
displaced in southern sudan by a 5yearold civil war according to 
bryan wannop representative of the un development program 
in addition experts from the washingtonbased world bank on 
monday proposed a twoyear 407 million reconstruction program 
from august and september floods that destroyed 31 billion in 
property 
sudan africas largest country has a foreign debt of 11 
billion 
in addition the government is spending about 1 million a day 
fighting the war in the south which the rebel sudan peoples 
liberation army seems to be winning on monday a rebel radio 
broadcast monitored in kenya claimed the capture of a sixth 
southern town in four weeks 
the guerrilla war fought between sudans arab moslem majority 
in the north and the christian animist minority in the south has 
driven almost 2 million people toward the north and east into 
ethiopia 
fighting in the countryside forced the population to abandon 
farming and cattlebreeding to trek to governmentcontrolled 
cities and subsist on relief food where war or bad weather often 
blocks the delivery of supplies 
western relief officials say about a million southerners have 
gathered in and around the capital of khartoum about 350000 in 
western ethiopia and half a million in the rest of sudan 
among those living at the edge of death are about 150000 people 
in kordofan and darfur areas just north of the southern battle 
zone an estimated 10000 have starved to death there during the 
summer 
the tragedy has prompted a 1 million airlift financed by the 
us agency for international development to the small village of 
abyei 500 miles southwest of khartoum where relief officials say 
10 people are dying every day the 10day airlift was halffinished 
on monday 
wannop the un development specialist said relief 
organizations plan to use the first 50 million relief to move 
displaced people about 200000 to 300000 people from kordofan and 
darfur toward their southern homelands but out of the reach of the 
fighting 
this would keep more refugees from inundating khartoum he said 
where about 1 million people are living in tinandcanvas shanty 
towns after scores have died in floods 
sudans minister of public communications taj elsir mustafa 
said the twoyear relief plan he accepted monday was based on 
surveys conducted during field work by world bank experts 
the program will be presented to donor countries and 
contributors next month he said 
mustafa and western experts said the study found the heavy rains 
will help the economy in many ways the rain ended an 8yearold 
drought and the minister said sudanese farmers should have bumper 
harvests this year with almost 10 times as much land under 
cultivation as during the drought

vietnam is attempting to reverse a 
deterioration in living standards by adopting a marketoriented 
approach to its economy and by attempting to attract foreign 
investment a member of vietnams national assembly said monday 
nguyen xuan oanh who also is a key economic adviser to the 
vietnamese government said a major impetus to the economic policy 
changes is the exploding growth rates of most capitalist 
economies in east asia 
speaking to a luncheon gathering at the carnegie endowment for 
international peace a private research group oanh acknowledged 
that vietnam is one of the poorest countries in the world 
oanh who once taught at two american universities and was an 
official of both the international monetary fund and the south 
vietnamese government said vietnam is moving away from a centrally 
planned economy in order to free the forces of production 
he added that the foreign investment code is extremely liberal 
because vietnam is entering the competition for outside business 
quite late in the game and more advantageous terms are required 
oanh has conferred with us business executives during his 
visit to the united states but american investment in vietnam is 
forbidden by a us trade embargo against that country 
visits by vietnamese officials to the united states have been 
rare a state department official asking not to be identified 
said oanhs visit apparently was part of hanois policy of trying 
to expand ties to the west he is in the united states at the 
invitation of several academic institutions 
vietnam is one of a handful of countries with which the united 
states does not maintain diplomatic relations 
official usvietnamese contacts have been limited mostly to

the following is the citation by the 
nobel assembly for the 1988 nobel prize in medicine announced 
monday and the summary of the winners achievements as released in 
an englishlanguage statement 
the nobel assembly at the karolinska institute has today decided 
to award the nobel prize in physiology or medicine for 1988 jointly 
to sir james w black gertrude b elion and george h hitchings 
for their discoveries of important principles for drug treatment 
summary 
the discoveries awarded with this years nobel prize in 
physiology or medicine concern important principles in drug 
treatment principles that have resulted in the development of a 
series of new drugs 
sir james w black realized the great pharmacotherapeutic 
potential of receptor blocking drugs and developed in 1964 the 
first clinically useful betareceptor blocking drug propranolol 
this type of drug is now being used in the treatment of coronary 
heart disease angina pectoris myocardial infarction and 
hypertension 
in 1972 black characterized a new group of histamine receptors 
h2receptors and subsequently developed the first clinically 
useful h2receptor antagonist cimetidine a new principle in the 
treatment of peptic ulcer was thereby introduced 
gertrude elion and george hitchings who have collaborated since 
1945 demonstrated differences in nucleic acid metabolism between 
normal human cells cancer cells protozoa bacteria and virus on 
the basis of such differences a series of drugs were developed that 
block nucleic acid synthesis in cancer cells and noxious organisms 
without damaging the normal human cells 
over the years elions and hutchings research philosophy has 
formed the basis for development of new drugs against a variety of 
diseases during 195051 they developed thioguanine and 
6mercaptopurine against leukemia and pyrimethamine against 
malaria azathioprine a drug that prevents rejection of 
transplanted organs and allopurinol which is used in the treatment 
of gout were developed in 1957 and 1963 respectively 
an important discovery was that the chemotherapeutic effects of 
pyrimethamine and trimethoprim were markedly enhanced by 
sulphonamides a recent successful application of their research 
ideas is exemplified by acyclovir 1977 the first effective drug 
in the treatment of herpes virus infections

a new computer system of evaluating the 
production potential of dairy cows has been devised to help farmers 
select only the best animals the agriculture department said 
monday 
the genetic evaluation system called the animal model takes 
into account more of a cows relatives than does the older system 
the modified contemporary comparison which has been used since 
1974 the departments agricultural research service reported 
under the new system milk production of a cows daughters will 
be considered when the mother is being evaluated and the 
evaluation of bulls based in part on the records of the males 
offspring also take into account the impact of the bulls mate on 
those offspring 
the new system will be used for the first time in dairy genetic 
evaluations to be prepared in july 1989 the report said the 
information then will be reported to dairy farmers who can use it 
to decide which cows and their calves to keep in the herd 
with this information in hand the farmer can select with more 
accuracy the calves likely to be the most efficient milk 
producers the report said

a small group of environmental activists gathered 
outside george bushs massachusetts campaign office monday 
denouncing the republican presidential candidates environmental 
record and calling him a hypocrite for badmouthing michael 
dukakis role in boston harbor pollution 
the group released a report compiled by a national environmental 
lobby that said bush as vice president took or endorsed numerous 
steps that have harmed or endangered the nations waters and 
wetlands 
george bush was not an idle spectator in the reagan 
administrations assault on the environment said the report by 
clean water action rather for eight years he aggressively 
pursued an agenda which responded to the special interests of 
polluters and resulted in massive destruction of wetlands 
throughout the country 
the report focused on bushs role as chairman of a regulatory 
task force that rescinded or relaxed several regulations affecting 
sewage treatment and wetlands protection programs 
the group also credited dukakis with beginning the cleanup of 
boston harbor despite cutbacks in federal cleanup funds because of 
reagan administration cuts endorsed by bush

a soviet spokesman on monday refused to define the 
duties of former soviet ideology chief yegor k ligachev but denied 
that ligachev or anyone else is no 2 on the ruling politburo 
all members of the politburo are equal and some are more equal 
than others said foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov paraphrasing george orwells satire of communist society 
in the novel animal farm 
but he said president mikhail s gorbachev has no official 
secondincommand despite western reports that ligachev once 
chaired meetings of the 12member ruling body of the communist 
party 
ligachev has been considered the top conservative rival of 
gorbachev who is waging a campaign for economic and political 
reform 
what you call no 2 doesnt exist gerasimov told reporters 
at a government news briefing 
still ligachev appeared monday at gorbachevs right side at the 
opening of a national conference of doctors in the kremlin 
gerasimov left strong doubts whether ligachev came out of a 
recent politburo power play with control over agriculture 
traditionally the nations toughest assignment 
after being deprived of the key ideology portfolio this year 
ligachev was named chairman of a new central committee commission 
on agriculture in a shakeup of the kremlin leadership sept 30 
since the core of the powerful central committee apparatus will 
consist of just six of these commissions the job was hardly a 
removal from power but it clearly gave ligachev less clout than 
his former post as overseer of ideology 
gerasimov hedged when he was asked pointblank who is 
controlling agriculture ligachev or fellow politburo member 
viktor p nikonov who had that job before the shakeup 
it is the commission that will run agriculture gerasimov 
said 
specific duties are still evolving and those of ligachev and 
nikonov have yet to be defined he said 
at a similar briefing several days ago gerasimov promised to 
explain what ligachevs and nikonovs new duties are 
last week ligachev was notably absent from an important 
agriculture conference where gorbachev edged closer to dismantling 
the collective farm system controlled from moscow with a plan to 
allow farmers to lease fields nationwide 
gerasimov said ligachev was on vacation during the meeting and 
that he didnt have to be present for all discussions of farm 
issues 
ligachev has publicly doubted gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
openness on selected topics he was reported losing his grip on 
power and the ideology job in april when reports said he was on 
vacation after receiving a reprimand from gorbachev 
the former party bureaucrat from siberia rose to the 
policymaking central committee and a key job assigning party 
personnel under former soviet leader yuri andropov in 1983 he 
joined the politburo in 1985 
nikonov is an agriculture expert with roots in gorbachevs home 
soil in southern russia and his career climbed with gorbachevs 
when gorbachev became party chief for agriculture in 1978 nikonov 
became deputy soviet minister for agriculture essentially a top 
aide in the parallel government bureaucracy

roy disney met mickey mouse in moscow this 
weekend but it was the wrong rodent 
a bad copy disney said ruefully monday describing the 
costumed figure who has been enticing parents into ordering 
pictures of their children from a state photographer on the arbat 
pedestrian mall 
such counterfeiting is a big obstacle keeping soviet children 
from enjoying the same disney fantasies as their foreign 
counterparts 
a soviet festival of disney films is playing in moscow but it 
wont expand beyond that until the counterfeiting issue is solved 
said disney a vice chairman of the company 
disney films have not been shown in the soviet union since a 
lone appearance in a film festival 50 years ago according to 
soviet media yet the companys cartoon characters are popular 
motifs for soviet fashion unfortunately for disney none of the 
manufacturers has paid a penny in royalties 
we need to talk it out disney said soviet officials are 
aware that disney requires protection of its intellectual 
property through copyrights or similar means he added 
disney would like to show its films sell mickey ears and 
publish its familiar books and music in the soviet union he said 
but disney added that he expects no concrete deals on this visit 
because the intellectual property issue must be settled first 
disney is discussing possible joint productions with the soviet 
film agency but this requires a story best filmed in the soviet 
union disney said 
soviet officials said earlier they were discussing disney 
involvement in building wonderland a planned theme park 
in answer to a question however disney said he doubted his 
company would ever build a soviet version of disneyland

permanently enforce the collection of fines conduct background 
investigations of employees and monitor all indian gaming 
activities 
the measure also authorizes 2 million for the first year of the 
commissions operation and requires that its operation be financed

lawyers representing 24 britons charged 
with involuntary manslaughter in a 1985 fatal soccer riot appealed 
monday for a fair trial as the proceedings opened 
families of some of the 39 people killed in the heysel stadium 
riot attended the trial which was interrupted twice by bomb 
threats 
this trial must restore the honor which belgium lost in the 
heysel stadium said defense lawyer serge moureaux it must be 
a fair trial the court should not try to choke the truth justice 
must repair everything 
also present were some of the survivors of the riot which 
injured 400 people one frenchman who refused to identify himself 
said outside the courtroom that he survived the stampede and added 
when i see them the british fans laughing i could kill them 
the stampede began when the fence separating british and italian 
fans at the european cup soccer final between liverpool and 
juventuis turin broke britons charged italians retreated in panic 
and the 39 were trampled to death 
belgian police forces were blamed for their incapacity to quell 
the riot moureaux quoted a belgian state police sergeant as 
telling investigators i never saw such a lack of command 
the incident provoked the resignation of belgian government 
several months later 
moureaux quoted a belgian state police sergeant as telling 
investigators i never saw such a lack of command 
the sergeant reportedly added that he saw a police officer run 
away from the riots 
another defense lawyer georgeshenri beauthier asked the court 
president to reject videocassettes of the incident he also 
rejected the alleged identification by italian witnesses of the 
defendents from photographs 
we fear the immolation of a few of our clients on the altar of 
collective frenzy he said we dont find it good and 
comfortable to condemn a few people chosen at random from films to 
reassure public opinion 
the defendents if convicted face up to 10 years in jail the 
proceedings are expected to last at least until christmas

a housetohouse survey of nearly 800 
lowincome families in washington state suggests that as many as 5 
million of americas children suffer from hunger a private 
activist group said monday 
the food research and action center is extending the study to 
seven other states over the next 15 months but on the basis of the 
early data from washington state we estimate conservatively 
that 2 million to 5 million children in this country could now have 
a serious hunger problem said robert j fersh executive 
director of the center 
we believe that this estimate is conservative because it 
attempts only to estimate the number of children living in poverty 
who might be hungry said fersh it does not include any 
children from families with incomes above the poverty line who 
might be hungry 
at the same time fersh acknowledged that he has no way of 
knowing whether the survey results in washington state will be 
replicated in larger studies 
similar studies are now under way in minnesota florida 
connecticut california michigan alabama and new york 
the survey techiques were first used in a 1986 survey in 
connecticut and refined for the washington state and ongoing 
studies all of which involve selecting lowincome families at 
random and then conducting facetoface interviews that take about 
45 minutes each 
the responses given by mothers to a lengthy questionnaire are 
correlated with other information such as family income and what 
if any public assistance such as food stamps they receive 
among the questions does your household ever run out of money 
to buy food to make a meal do your children ever eat less than you 
feel they should because there is not enough money for food 
a respondent had to answer yes to at least five such 
questions before being placed in the hunger category 
dr victor sidel a professor of social medicine at the albert 
einstein college of medicine in new york city headed the food 
research and action centers technical advisory committee and said 
the survey techniques used are the best yet developed for measuring 
hunger 
the evidence is in the evidence is clear the evidence is 
scientific he said 
sidel emphasized that the kind of hunger seen among americas 
children is not of the dramatic lifethreatening variety common in 
african countries 
but he said there are other kinds of medical and physical 
consequences inexcusable in a country as rich as the united 
states 
it is a violation of equality of opportunity to force poor 
children to go to school hungry said sidel 
fersh said one major finding of the washington state study is 
that it shows people do not supplement to the extent the food 
stamp program assumes the amount of assistance they get from that 
particular agriculture department program 
the reason he said is that they are paying ever higher prices 
for rent child care and medical costs the food budget is the 
most elastic he said and that is what is cut first 
washington state was not singled out because hunger was believed 
better or worse but as an outgrowth of the governors task force 
on hunger created there in 1986 to try to document the extent and 
nature of hunger in the state 
the food action research center relies on the support of 
foundations religious groups corporations individuals and others 
to carry out its hunger and poverty programs

guerrillas continued fighting government 
troops at camps near the thai border monday after capturing several 
hills controlled by the military regime a government spokesman 
said 
the ethnic karen guerrillas first attacked the camps near 
methawaw about 130 miles northeast of rangoon on sept 26 since 
then they have killed 35 government soldiers including one 
officer and wounded 95 said government spokesman kyaw sann three 
others were missing he said 
rebel casualties were believed heavy but a count was not 
possible because the guerrillas dragged away their dead and 
wounded kyaw sann said 
methawaw is on the west bank of the moei river which forms the 
border between burma and thailand 
the karens who are fighting for the autonomy of an area along 
the border form the strongest of burmas dozen insurgencies 
karens represent about 2 million of burmas 38 million people 
kyaw sann said about 1000 guerrillas were involved in the 
attacks near methawaw the guerrillas said they recaptured several 
hills wednesday in an area government forces had seized more than 
four years ago 
kyaw sann said government troops also attacked two other karen 
strongholds at maela on oct 9 and at wangkha on oct 13 seven 
soldiers were killed and 24 were injured and fierce fighting 
continued at wangkha on monday he said 
kyaw sann also said students who recently fled to the border 
areas to join the guerrillas must return by nov 18 or they will be 
regarded as rebels he said the government has established 
reception centers at 27 towns in areas bordering bangladesh 
india china and thailand 
the government regarded these students as youths misled and 
gone astray he said they will be welcomed at reception 
centers where they will be well looked after before sending them 
back to their respective homes we will have to regard them as 
rebels after the deadline of nov 18 
officials of various rebel groups say more than 9000 students 
and other civilians have arrived at rebel camps since military 
commander gen saw maung seized power in rangoon sept 18 and 
crushed prodemocracy demonstrations in the cities 
radio rangoon announced that two more political parties 
registered monday bringing to 20 the number formed after saw 
maungs coup 
the two parties the peoples volunteer organization and the 
democratic progressive allies party have elderly leaders who were 
politically active before burma achieved its independence in 1948

government researchers are investigating whether 
as many as 20000 people who lived near the hanford nuclear 
reservation in washington state in the 1940s and early 1950s were 
contaminated by radioactive spills 
the federal centers for disease control said the leakage over 
about nine years of several radioactive elements especially iodine 
131 apparently is the most massive radioactive leak of any 
facility in the country 
the reservation opened in 1944 and produced the plutonium for 
the atom bomb that destroyed nagasaki japan in 1945 
a lot of iodine 131 was released into the atmosphere at 
hanford said dr dan hoffman assistant director of the cdcs 
center for environmental health and injury control which is doing 
the study 
he said research in utah and the marshall islands in the pacific 
indicated iodine 131 can cause thyroid problems 
records of the hanford leak and the size of the dose were not 
released until a spokane wash environmental group obtained them 
in 1986 under the freedom of information act 
congress last month authorized the study which hoffman said may 
take 5 years and cost up to 6 million 
he said there is no proof yet that there have been longrange 
damaging effects from the radiation spill 
its all anecdotal so far he said the most difficult 
task will be to find the people to reassemble the populations and 
try and track them down 
he said the cdc will use birth and school records to try to find 
people who lived downwind to the west of the nuclear reservation 
in richland in southeastern washington state 
that will be our hardest job he said i imagine they have 
spread out all over the place 
he said iodine 131 has a radioactive halflife of only eight 
days thus deteriorates quickly and does not linger in the 
environment and remain a problem some radioactive materials are 
thought to remain dangerous for centuries 
the department of energy which owns the reservation also is 
trying to determine the size of the dose nearby residents may have 
received 
there are nine nuclear reactors at hanford and eight are closed 
permanently the ninth was placed on cold standby earlier this 
year after the energy department decided not to restart it after

a researcher experimenting with a new 
more sensitive test for the aids virus said monday that the virus 
does not appear to be carried in sperm cells 
that discovery could eventually mean that men with aids could 
father children by separating their sperm cells from infected semen 
and using those cells for artificial insemination 
semen which is ejaculated is made up of both sperm cells and 
seminal fluid 
but dr bernard poisez a researcher at the state university of 
new york health science center at syracuse said its a discovery 
that needs more study 
all were saying is that we have a test thats so good we can 
detect these things and now we need to do some very carefully 
conducted clinical tests poisez said 
he said he wouldnt recommend that men infected with aids 
attempt to pursue fatherhood through artificial insemination and he 
doesnt think fertility clinics or in vitro centers would agree to 
try this without further testing 
poisez said determining whether the aids virus is carried inside 
a sperm cell is one of many studies to exploit a new means of 
testing for the aids virus 
the new technique developed by cetus corp of emeryville 
calif uses a chemical reaction called a polymerase chain 
reaction to amplify genetic material such as that from the aids 
virus a million times making it easier to detect poisez said 
the test is faster more accurate and cheaper than some current 
aids tests 
another finding with the new test poisez said is a decline in 
the number of men with aids who have the virus in their semen 
other researchers using the test have documented similar findings 
he said 
poisez said he has looked at 500 semen samples over the past 
four or five years and that over that period even with a more 
sensitive test the number of samples containing the virus has 
fallen 
initially about 75 percent of the men had the virus in their 
semen but recently poisez said researchers have found the virus in 
just 20 percent of homosexual men who had similar characteristics 
as the initial group 
we think this is because they have fewer white blood cells in 
their semen said poisez as a result of safe sex and better 
care we believe the amount of infections and level of inflammation 
has been reduced 
without the infections and inflammations the number of white 
blood cells decreases poisez said 
this is another finding that needs to be studied but poisez 
said it could eventually mean that researchers could determine when 
its especially dangerous to have even safe sex 
he said researchers at the state health center are currently 
studying whether the test can be used to determine 
how effective about six or seven aidsfighting drugs are by 
measuring how quickly they are reducing the number of aidsinfected 
cells in the body 
whether some mothers infected with aids would be better 
candidates for prenatal use of aidsfighting drugs 
if there are particular times when its more likely for an 
unusually large number of aidsinfected cells to be present in the 
semen

the government announced the award of nearly 
7 million for construction of health care facilities specifically 
for aids patients on monday the first federal money to be directed 
for such programs 
the awards went to facilities that were able to demonstrate a 
comprehensive costeffective approach to providing care health 
and human services secretary otis r bowen said in a statement a 
variety of traditional and nontraditional facilities received the 
funds which are to be regarded as seed money 
with nearly 300000 people expected to be suffering from aids 
within three years compared with about 75000 diagnosed so far 
a major challenge facing the health care industry is for 
costeffective ways to care for such patients 
aids sufferers often are not in constant need of the costly care 
supplied by acutecare hospitals yet are too sick to be cared for 
at home 
the grants announced monday were to 19 facilities in nine states 
to renovate or construct nonacute care intermediate and longterm 
care facilities for patients with aids acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
the nine states are arizona california indiana maryland 
massachusetts new jersey new york texas and washington 
bowen said the grant recipients had to guarantee that a 
reasonable volume of services would be provided to patients unable 
to pay and that services must be made available to all people 
living or working in a facilitys service area 
the grant receipients are

a lawyer for subway gunman bernhard goetz 
asked the states highest court monday to give weight to little 
words and overturn a gun possession conviction stemming from his 
1984 shooting of four teenagers 
attorney mark baker told the new york court of appeals that 
state supreme court justice stephen cranes charge to jurors last 
year that they must convict if they found the prosecution had 
proven its case amounted to taking away the jurys 
constitutionally granted discretion baker said the judge should 
have used the word may 
thats what this profession is all about much ado about 
little words baker said after his court appearance the word 
must to a conscientious jury precludes it from perhaps exercising 
its own discretion 
however during the hearing judge joseph bellacosa questioned 
baker about the possibility that judges might be giving jurors a 
showmercy message with a wink and a nod if they didnt tell 
them of their duty to convict if the case against the defendant had 
been proved 
gregory waples an assistant district attorney in new york city 
raised the same concern in arguing that goetzs conviction should 
be upheld waples said that for trial judges to be forced to use 
may instead of must would be a red flag in some cases for 
jurors to decide cases on their personal predilections and contrary 
to the rule of law 
baker said that if juries werent allowed to have some 
discretion then we dont need a jury we need a computer 
goetz who was not at mondays hearing cant expect a decision 
from the court of appeals for several weeks 
goetz an electronics technician was convicted in june 1987 of 
thirddegree criminal possession of a weapon in connection with the 
december 1984 shooting aboard a subway train of four black youths 
he said were trying to rob him the youths who all survived said 
they were simply panhandling for money 
goetz was acquitted of all other charges against him 
goetzs case drew national attention with supporters claiming he 
was a hero who reacted properly to a wave of subway and street 
crime opponents complained that his supporters were glorifying 
vigilantism 
a year ago this week crane sentenced goetz to six months in 
jail 280 hours of community service five years probation and 
psychiatric counseling and fined him 5000 
on the initial appeal of goetzs conviction a lower state court 
refused to throw out the conviction but did order that goetz be 
resentenced on the prison portion of his penalty 
the appellate division of state supreme court said goetz should 
have been given an indeterminate sentence or under terms of new 
yorks tough guncontrol law a oneyear term with no probation 
while goetzs attorneys have fought to have the conviction 
itself overturned and get a new trial on the weapons possession 
charge they have favored a oneyear jail term rather than six 
months because of a quirk in new yorks law the sixmonth 
sentence meant goetz would have had to serve at least four months 
before he could be released while with a oneyear sentence he 
could have been freed after just two months 
baker said goetz is trying to get on with his life and 
does travel around the country servicing his clients as an 
electronics expert 
he said that while goetz still rides the subway he probably 
doesnt carry a gun 
i certainly hope not said baker i dont want to have to 
go through this again

two north carolina 
researchers who won the nobel prize for medicine monday said the 
best reward for their work was seeing people overcome disease with 
the medicines they developed 
theres nothing that gives you a lift like seeing somebody get 
better from a serious disease said biochemist gertrude b elion 
the nobel is something that is going to disappear in a few days 
but the other seeing patients recover is permanent 
not taking anything away from the nobel prize but the prize 
is recognition not reward she said the reward is seeing the 
improvement your work makes 
im pleased more for my descendants than i am for myself 
said george h hitchings a colleague of ms elions at wellcome 
research laboratories inc ive had a lot of honors but the most 
important honors for me have been meeting patients whose lives have 
been saved or whose childrens lives have been saved by drugs ive 
invented 
hitchings 83 and ms elion 70 began collaborating 44 years 
ago and have developed drugs for use against leukemia malaria 
gout organ transplant rejection herpes virus infections and 
bacterial infections both carry the title scientist emeritus and 
are officially retired but come to the lab daily 
the nobel assembly at karolinska institute said their ideas also 
paved the way for development of azidothymidine or azt which is 
the best documented drug so far in the treatment of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome and the only one approved for use in the united 
states 
the two north carolina scientists share the 390000 prize with 
sir james w black of kings college hospital medical school in 
london his research led to a beta blocker drug for heart disease 
and a drug for peptic ulcers 
ms elion said she had not known she had been nominated for the 
prize and had never seriously considered that she might win it 
the only people who thought i might get it was my family 
she said when i got the first call from a reporter about 630 
am i told him i thought it was a practical joke and not a very 
funny one 
although she officially retired five years ago she makes daily 
trips to burroughs wellcome to consult with other researchers 
whats the use of retiring she said if you dont have 
anything to contribute anymore people will tell you but as long 
as you can make a contribution you should 
ms elion has worked at wellcome research laboratories since 
1944 and as a senior research chemist since 1950 since 1983 she 
has been a scientist emeritus at the laboratory and a research 
professor of pharmacology at duke university 
hitchings after teaching at harvard and western reserve 
university joined burroughs wellcome in 1942 he became its 
research director in 1955 and retired in 1975 as vice president for 
research he was a director of the company from 1968 to 1984 and is

herman fountain a former heroin addict turned independent baptist 
pastor have returned since the june confrontations and a few new 
students have enrolled 
religious boarding homes arent regulated under mississippi law 
but several lawmakers concerned about schools like fountains say 
theyll offer various licensing and registration bills when the 
legislature convenes in january 
no charges have been filed against anyone at bethel in 
connection with the allegations of abuse and neglect however 
several childrens testimony of abusive practices resulted in their

lucedale the order came from a youth court judge looking into 
several allegations of beatings and other abuse 
some state officials say fountain told the children to flee 
before welfare officers arrived he denies this however many of 
the youths there were up to 120 at bethel according to fountain 
took off and law officers spent several days rounding them up 
from the streets 
fountain says 50 troubled youths have never been accounted for

as the educational basics 
addressing students of two parochial high schools in northeast 
washington reagan said it amazes me that while you are exploring 
the mysteries of gods love and all that goes with it others 
around the nation deny the public importance of the private virtues 
you are mastering 
reagan accompanied by education secretary lauro cavazos 
visited archbishop carroll high school where students of that 
school were gathered in a gymnasium with students from all saints 
high school

help parents who wish to send their children to parochial schools 
catholic schools across america are showing that private 
virtue and public interest do indeed live together he said i 
know that your parents all make great sacrifices so that you can 
come here for years i have been urging congress to allow your 
parents to support your education either through tuition tax 
credits or vouchers 
we need a congress that shares and supports the values of the 
american people he said

leadership positions in the future

a comatose woman has a constitutional 
right to have her feeding tubes removed despite objections by a 
state attorney that she would starve to death a federal judge 
ruled monday 
an individual has a constitutional right to control fundamental 
medical decisions affecting ones own body even if that will 
result in death us district judge francis j boyle said 
medical ethics incorporates the principle that the patient 
not the health care provider determines what the course of care 
should be the judge said 
marcia gray 49 has been in a coma since jan 4 1986 when a 
blood vessel burst in her brain she had told her husband and 
relatives on several occasions that if stricken she would not 
want to be kept alive by artificial means boyles opinion noted 
although she breathes on her own doctors agree she suffered 
massive brain damage and is in a persistent vegetative state 
boyles decision said 
the case attracted national attention last year when bishop 
louis e gelineau of the roman catholic diocese of providence 
approved a theologians opinion that it was morally permissible to 
withdraw mrs grays nourishment that opinion which has been 
criticized by other moral theologians said mrs grays feeding was 
circumventing the dying process 
her husband and guardian h glenn gray asked to have her 
feeding tube removed in march 1987 officials of rhode island 
medical center general hospital which is run by the department of 
mental health retardation and hospitals refused setting up the 
states first legal test of a patients right to die 
mrs gray has a constitutional right to privacy and the right 
to protect ones bodily integrity linda a macdonald attorney 
for the gray family argued at a june hearing 
john lp breguet the states attorney argued that no federal 
constitutional issues were involved and even if they were 
implementation of those standards was really up to the individual 
states to decide 
boyle said an argument by breguet that mrs gray would suffer a 
painful death was hollow in light of the medical testimony that 
marcia gray is incapable of suffering any sensation including 
pain 
boyle ruled that if mrs gray cannot be promptly transferred to 
a health care facility that will respect her wishes general 
hospital must remove the feeding tubes 
general hospital will try to find another facility to accept 
mrs gray and failing that will consider appealing the decision 
breguet said monday after speaking with mhrh director thomas d 
romeo who was the defendant in the lawsuit

irans foreign minister said monday his 
country would accept a united nations formula for implementing a 
peace pact in its 8year war with iraq but on one condition the 
official iranian news agency reported 
the report by the islamic republic news agency quoted foreign 
minister ali akhbar velayati as saying the condition is that a 1975 
accord that placed the southern border between the two countries as 
running through the middle of the shatt alarab waterway be 
maintained 
the dispatch monitored in nicosia said un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar proposed the compromise plan and listed its 
four points as withdrawal of all forces to international 
boundaries agreement not to search ships in the persian gulf 
exchange of prisoners of war and dredging of the shatt alarab 
the dispute over the estuary which is iraqs only waterway 
access to the gulf was a key issue in the war 
peace talks that started aug 25 stalled quickly over iraqs 
insistence that the shatt alarab be dredged iran claimed that was 
a secondary issue that could be settled later 
peace negotiations are scheduled to resume later this month in 
geneva 
there was no immediate reaction from iraq to the iranian 
announcement but iraq rejected the 1975 treaty years ago iran 
insists that the pact known as the algiers treaty is valid 
iraqi president saddam hussein tore up a copy of the 1975 treaty 
in a televised broadcast five days before his troops invaded iran 
in september 1980 
velayati was quoted as saying monday that future peace talks 
in geneva will be fruitful if iraq relents its current obstinacy 
and is ready to cooperate for the implementation of the un 
chiefs plan 
the agency said velayati made the comments at a news conference 
at the foreign ministry 
it reported velayati also made these statement on other matters 
iran will not change its policy toward the united states as 
long as washington continues its hostile behavior toward iran 
talks with britain about restoring relations were continuing 
and cannot be said to have reached a deadlock 
some difficulties exist in relations with saudi arabia 
which in april severed diplomatic relations with iran accusing it 
of supporting terrorists

prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski on 
monday told the first meeting of his cabinet that the new 
government begins its work in conditions of substantial 
disorder 
only palpable measurable effects of improvement can overcome 
the attitude of hopelessness in society rakowski said according 
to a report by the pap news agency 
it said rakowski also declared that law and order must be 
maintained and accused antigovernment protesters who demonstrated 
sunday of trying to block planned talks between the communist 
authorities and the opposition 
rakowski became prime minister sept 27 and his cabinet was 
approved by the sejm or parliament last friday 
polish television broadcast scenes of hundreds of prosolidarity 
demonstrators marching sunday in the port city of gdansk 
birthplace of the nowoutlawed independent trade union movement 
and then demonstrators hurling stones at riot police 
rakowski said the government holds the opinion that the 
manifestations of political adventurism were provocations aimed 
at torpedoing national agreement pap reported 
such incidents drastically disturb the atmosphere before the 
promised roundtable discussions he said adding 
the government discussed indispensable measures to counteract 
attempts at destabilizing the country and to enforce law and public 
order 
roundtable talks that would include the topics of trade unions 
and political and economic reforms had been expected to begin this 
week but disagreements over the way they would be conducted and 
who would participate have forced a delay said andrzej 
stelmachowski a mediator attempting to arrange the discussions 
the government has said solidarity representatives would not be 
allowed to participate 
other opposition leaders turned down offers to join the new 
government pending results of the talks but pap said rakowski told 
his cabinet the government would carry out reforms before the 
negotiations begin 
it reported he said restructuring the economy must be 
radicalized and accelerated market supplies increased and price 
increases curbed 
economic reform will mean that people who want to work better 
can count on increased incomes he said 
referring to strikes that shook poland in may and august 
rakowski said the sources of conflicts have not disappeared 
thus the welfare of workers and all working people their needs 
and perceptions must remain at the center of the governments 
attention 
gen wojciech jaruzelski head of the communist party and 
polands top leader attended the meeting and called the new 
cabinet a government of great opportunity according to pap 
it reported the general spoke of various kinds of 
provocation but said authorities remain fully and deeply 
convinced about the necessity for reconciliation

who test positive for aids from serving in another country 
state department officials said monday it was the first time 
such a provision was included in a bases agreement it also may 
ease a dispute with manila over reported cases of the infectious 
disease among bar hostesses 
pentagon policy since january 1987 has barred overseas 
assignments for service personnel who test positive for acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome aids testing of recruits began in 
october 1986 
soldiers or sailors with aids may remain in the service within 
the united states unless and until they show symptoms of the 
disease at that point they are honorably discharged 
under a section of the bases agreement dealing with aids as a 
social issue 
the two governments affirmed their common concern over the 
global problem of aids and their common interest in the 
prevention and control of this disease 
the two governments agreed to exchange releasable 
information on the incidence of the infection 
the us government pledged that us military personnel who 
tested positive would not be assigned abroad 
the two governments agreed to have a committee look into ways 
to cooperate in prevention education testing detection and

the reagan administration on monday proposed 
allowing understaffed government agencies to hire temporary 
employee services to fill shortterm manpower needs in peak service 
periods and as substitutes for absent federal workers 
reversing a twodecade policy that banned use of temporary help 
suppliers except for a few rare instances the office of personnel 
management said the new policy will increase agencies flexibility 
in times and areas of labor shortages 
the new policy published monday in the federal register and 
scheduled to become effective in december or january amends 
rulings in 1967 and 1968 that effectively prohibited using 
temporary help firms as a violation of civil service laws 
opm director constance horner in an address monday to the 
national association of temporary services at its convention in 
phoenix ariz contended the new policy will benefit federal 
employees as well as the agencies they work for 
by permitting agencies to use temporaries we make it far 
easier for managers to say yes to employees who need time off for 
family responsibilities she said and by allowing agencies to 
use temporary help services we ensure that managers can get the 
replacement help they need when they need it 
government employee unions immediately attacked the proposal 
calling it the administrations latest attempt to contract out work 
now performed by their civil service members 
robert tobias president of the national treasury employees 
union said the government would pay significantly more by 
contracting with suppliers of temporary workers than if it hired 
more temporary workers directly by offering them higher pay 
tobias said a beginning clerktypist under civil service is now 
paid between 13500 and 15000 a year or 6 to 7 an hour 
in the washington area temporary help suppliers are charging 
anywhere from 12 to 15 an hour for a person he said it 
would be a lot cheaper if they cut out the middleman and offered to 
increase the pay by 20 percent 
under the new regulations an agency could use temporary help 
services only in cases in which a regular federal employee is 
absent because of emergency accident maternity leave or illness 
or to fill a shortterm gap when a worker is transferred or their 
job is being contracted out 
but temporary help services also could be relied upon if the 
work is in a shortage occupation which the agency is aggressively 
seeking to fill permanently 
james lafferty an opm spokesman said the government is facing 
large shortages of clerical workers and secretaries in highcost 
cities where unemployment rates are low specifically he cited 
washington new york boston los angeles chicago and san 
francisco 
red evans a spokesman for the national federation of federal 
employees called the second provision a loophole that would 
allow widescale use of temporary workers and substantial abuses to 
the detriment of a permanent civil service 
its a copout as far as were concerned he said theyre 
having a hard time filling these jobs because they dont pay 
enough 
some agencies already have latitude to use temporary help 
agencies in special circumstances for example the us forest 
service has been utilizing them since the end of world war ii to 
supplement their crews during peak fire seasons 
the new policy would limit the use of any one employee from a 
temporary help service to 45 working days during a sixmonth 
period temporaries also could not be used more than 90 working 
days a year for a particular position or to displace any current 
federal employee

increases in poverty rates and income 
stagnation among blacks have helped push the economic gap between 
black and white families below figures from the late 1970s and 
1960s a private research organization said monday 
a study by the liberaloriented center on budget and policy 
priorities concluded that both black married and singleparent 
families lost economic ground behind white families during the last 
decade 
in 1987 the income of the typical black family at 18098 
equaled just 561 percent of the typical white familys income 
32274 a lower percentage than any year in the late 1970s or 
late 1960s 592 percent center director robert greenstein said 
in a statement 
median family income for black families decreased by 854 
between 1978 and 1987 while the median income for white families 
increased 276 the study said 
greenstein said the center which studies government spending 
and public policy issues as they affect low and moderateincome 
americans used 1978 as a comparison year because economic 
conditions such as overall unemployment rates 62 percent in 
1978 were similar to those of 1987 61 percent 
black unemployment has dropped significantly in recent years 
but this has not been matched by comparable increases in black 
family income and declines in black poverty he said 
the evidence indicates that declines in wages for black 
workers compared to the 1970s and budget cuts at both federal and 
state levels in programs for lowincome families have contributed 
to black economic slippage greenstein said 
the study said that after adjusting for inflation the typical 
black fulltime black worker earned 315 a week in 1987 figure 
lower than that in any year in the 1970s when the wages ranged from 
340 to 330 this is compared to the 1987 salary given to their 
white counterparts whose salary ranged hovered around 420 
throughout the 1970s 
regionally income disparities between black and white families 
have increased since the late 1970s everywhere except in the west 
the study said the gap widened most in the midwest where typical 
black family income was nearly 4700 lower in 1987 than in the 
late 1970s while the income of the typical white family was only 
700 below the late1970s figures 
the most recent figures for 1987 indicate that black median 
family income was 634 percent of white income in the west 586 
percent in the northeast 563 percent in the south and 521 
percent in the midwest 
the study noted the growing income disparity between blacks and 
whites is a result of the growing income gap between upper and 
lowerincome families in the nation as a whole 
in 1987 the gap reached its widest point in 40 years it 
said as the poorest twofifths of american families received 
154 percent of the national family income in both 1986 and 1987 
their lowest share since the census bureau first collected data in 
1947 
conversely the richest onefifth of all families received 437 
percent of the national family income in 1986 and 1987 the highest 
percentage on record it said 
other findings included 
poverty rates for both blacks and whites climbed above levels 
in the 1970s with 2 million more blacks and 8 million more 
americans overall living in poverty in 1987 than in 1978 
despite a fifth year of economic recovery the black poverty 
rate rose from 311 percent in 1986 to 331 percent in 1987 while 
the white poverty rate declined from 11 percent to 105 percent 
budget reductions in programs for lowincome households has 
disproportionately affected blacks who are three times more likely 
than whites to be poor

first lady nancy reagan expressed regret 
monday that she failed to heed the advice of white house lawyers 
that she formally disclose her borrowing of gowns and other 
designer apparel but her press secretary and a government ethics 
spokesman said there was no legal requirement that she do so 
press secetary elaine crispen acknowledged that mrs reagan had 
reported such loans when the issue first arose in november 1981 
saying the first lady then decided to err on the side of 
compliance with the law 
since 1982 mrs reagan has continued to borrow and return items 
without reporting the transactions mrs crispen said even though 
white house lawyers originally had recommended disclosure as a 
precautionary measure 
mrs reagan regrets that she failed to heed counsels 
advice mrs crispen said in a formal statement late monday 
nevetheless no reporting rules or laws were violated 
a spokesman for the office of government ethics confirmed that 
the office had supported a conclusion of thenwhite house counsel 
fred fielding in 1982 that such reporting was not required under 
the ethics in government act of 1978 
the apparel mrs reagan received was either paid for given to 
her personally as gifts by old friends and not subject to 
reporting or loaned to her and returned all reporting 
requirements were met the statement released by mrs crispen 
said 
donald campbell a spokesman for the ethics office said 
officials there agreed with fieldings contention that no reporting 
was required under the act and said that mrs reagan has been 
operating under that guidance since that time 
campbell said officials in the federal ethics office had 
received a letter from fielding in which he laid out the fact 
that the first lady had borrowed certain gowns for certain events 
and in his opinion that was not something that needed to be 
reported 
campbell said that j jackson walters then the director of the 
federal ethics office agreed with fieldings conclusion 
but he also said in a telephone interview that since the 
question has been raised we will look at it again to see if we 
made the right decision 
mrs reagan is not considered an official or employee of the 
us government and is therefore not required to file her own 
disclosure form as the president must do on an annual basis she 
did make the initial disclosures of clothes transactions on her 
husbands disclosure form covering 1981 in what campbell described 
as an abundance of caution 
the issue was raised anew by the current issue of time magazine 
it said that mrs reagan has continued to accept and to wear 
expensive evening gowns and other outfits furnished by leading 
couturiers such as james galanos and david hayes without reporting 
the practice 
there are no taxpayers dollars that go toward the first 
ladys wardrobe whatsoever mrs crispen said in a telephone 
interview the spokeswoman said she thought the story was unmerited 
i think she mrs reagan has made americans so proud of the 
way she has represented them at official events the press 
secretary said for any first lady there have been mounds of 
things that you have to go to and you have to borrow and its not 
illegal 
mrs crispen said there have been things that have been 
borrowed since 1982 and they were returned 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater described reagan as 
upset over these attacks on the first lady he said that no 
internal review had been commenced in the wake of the time report 
saying i dont know that there needs to be one 
the time magazine article included pictures of mrs reagan 
posing with among others french president francois mitterrand and 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney and wearing expensive 
gowns the article said she borrowed gowns ranging in value to as 
high as 22000 for one such outfit 
mrs reagans spokeswoman denied that the first lady had kept 
any of the numerous dresses and outfits loaned to her by designers 
to a typical woman there are some gowns that are so 
spectacular that you would only wear it once she said 
los angeles designer david hayes said mrs reagan has borrowed 
60 to 80 madetoorder outfits during the past eight years she 
returned more than half and kept the others he was quoted as 
saying in the time article 
we think of it as loans its wonderful hayes said she 
has been a sensation for my business 
an unidentified executive at harry winston jewelers in new york 
city told time that mrs reagan continued to borrow expensive 
accessories including a pair of diamond earrings worth 800000 
mrs crispen said the first lady on two occasions borrowed 
jewelry from harry winston jewelers for the 1981 presidential 
inaugural and for the wedding of prince charles and lady diana 
later that year but the spokeswoman placed no value on the 
merchandise 
chris blazakis who worked with designer galanos and is writing 
a book about the reagans said he has identified more than 300 
photographs since 1982 showing mrs reagan wearing outfits he 
estimates are worth a total of more than 1 million retail 
reagans presidential salary is 200000 a year and his 1987 
tax form disclosed modest income that mrs reagan had received in 
talent fees and residuals from appearances on network television 
shows but no information about her clothing

athletes after a football game the american society of newspaper 
editors said monday 
in a letter to university chancellor joe b wyatt the newspaper 
group said reporter karen rosen of the atlanta journal and

otto chairman of the asne press bar and public affairs committee 
noting that ms rosen had not asked to enter the locker room

a footlong crack and 29 smaller cracks were 
discovered by chance on a continental airlines boeing 737 recently 
in roughly the same area where a similar aloha airlines jet broke 
apart in flight last april officials said monday 
metallurgists from the national transportation safety board were 
examining the 30inch section of the aircraft where the cracks were 
found along a lap joint or section where the outer metal skin 
overlaps near a window of the firstclass section 
ntsb chairman james kolstad said the chilling discovery was 
made by continental workers oct 5 when they began stripping paint 
from the 19yearold boeing 737 to prepare it for repainting 
kolstad in a speech delivered to an aviation group in montreal 
called the discovery frightening in part because the cracks 
were found by chance and because they were in the same general 
area where the aloha plane broke apart 
but federal aviation administration officials cautioned against 
comparing the aloha incident and the cracks found on the 
continental plane 
one faa official speaking on condition he not be further 
identified said the cracks on the continental jet were found at a 
point lower on the aircraft near a window and where there 
apparently had been repair work performed by a previous owner of 
the plane 
the aloha incident which remains under investigation by the 
ntsb is widely believed to involved cracking caused by corrosion 
but corrosion does not appear to have been a factor in the cracks 
on the continental aircraft this official suggested 
an faa spokesman bob buckhorn said the agency expects to issue 
a new directive soon to airlines broadening the inspection 
requirements on older boeing 737s in search of cracks including 
increased use of testing by highfrequency electronic equipment 
the new rule also will require that the planes be stripped of paint 
when being inspected he said 
a spokesman for continental said the airline inspected all 42 of 
its older boeing 737s within 72 hours after the footlong crack was 
discovered when the plane was being prepared for repainting at the 
airlines los angeles repair facility 
he said no cracks were found in any of the other planes 
this appears to be an isolated incident said continental 
spokesman ned walker in houston 
walker said the plane which was built in 1969 had undergone a 
visual inspection for cracks last may 20 in accordance with a 
directive from the faa and no cracks were found then 
according to the safety board the continental plane had about 
55446 takeoffs and landings this was considerably fewer than the 
89000 cycles attributed to the aloha boeing 737 involved in last 
aprils incident in which a 20foot section of the planes roof 
ripped away during flight 
a flight attendant was swept to her death but the plane 
miraculously landed safely with passengers and flight attendants 
clinging to their seats to keep from being sucked through the 
gaping hole 
the aloha 737 was the 152nd off the boeing assembly line while 
the continental jet was no 17o both were built in 1969 and were 
among the 291 737s on which a socalled cold bonding process 
was used to fix sections of metal sheets onto the fuselage 
shortly after the aloha incident the faa required airlines to 
conduct special inspections of more than 200 older 737s those 
aircraft with more than 30000 takeoffs and landings were required 
to be visually inspected for cracks while those with more than 
50000 takeoffs and landings were to undergo inspections with 
highfrequency electronic equipment 
the socalled eddy current tests are designed to uncover 
extremely tiny cracks that might be overlooked in a visual 
inspection 
although the continental plane where the footlong crack was 
found oct 5 had more than 50000 cycles the eddy current 
inspection was not required on the section of the aircraft where 
the crack later was discovered walker said he said a visual 
inspection of that section of the plane showed no cracking last may 
the boeing 737 is widely used for shorthaul flights according 
to the boeing co 212 older boeing 737s operated by 19 us 
airlines in domestic service were subject to the special faa 
inspection requirements last may 
boeing spokesman david jimenez said in seattle the company was 
referring any questions to continental regarding the discovery of 
cracks

the salaries and benefits given ptl 
founders jim and tammy bakker were properly approved and legal the 
bakkers lawyer told a judge monday in the trial of ptls 52 
million lawsuit against the couple and a former aide 
in his opening statement ryan hovis said the case against the 
bakkers boiled down to allegations they mismanaged the ministry 
which went into bankruptcy three months after bakker resigned in a 
sexandhush money scandal 
hovis said he would show that the bakkers salaries were 
authorized by the ministrys board the benefits they enjoyed were 
properly donated by the ministry and the cash advances they 
received were reimbursed 
but because the ministrys records are now dispersed among other 
legal actions including bankruptcy court hovis said he may be 
unable to provide precise documentation 
a lot of the records are simply not available he told us 
bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds 
instead hovis said he would show a pattern of 
reimbursement and prior approval 
hovis comments marked the start of the second half of testimony 
in the lawsuit against the bakkers and former aide david taggart 
last month ptl attorneys tom white and brad leggett entered 
into evidence financial records from bakkers time as leader of ptl 
and brought in ptl officials and an internal revenue service agent 
to testify on behalf of its claims of mismanagement 
among the items admitted as evidence were receipts for 
extravagant purchases by the bakkers including installing a water 
slide at their lakefront home 
ptl also presented irs documents that the bakkers and taggart 
received compensation and bonuses far in excess of accepted irs 
guidelines 
on monday herbert moore who said he has done financial 
consulting work for hundreds of churches including ptl testified 
that standard financial procedures for businesses were not the norm 
for churches which found needs first and then sought the revenues 
to pay for them 
is it fair to say that financial matters of the church are 
dealt with on faith hovis asked 
yes moore replied 
ptl sought protection in june 1987 under chapter 11 of the 
bankruptcy code which shields an operation from creditors while it 
reorganizes 
on monday reynolds who is overseeing the bankruptcy case said 
he wants to see how the proposed sale of the ministrys heritage 
usa complex shapes up before considering whether to liquidate ptls 
assets 
reynolds postponed until nov 16 consideration of several 
motions by creditors to move the ministry from chapter 11 to 
chapter 7 if granted it would mean the heritage usa christian 
entertainment park and other ministry assets such as satellite 
television facilities a hotel and real estate would be sold by an 
immediate auction rather than by an arranged sale 
canadian businessman stephen mernick has signed a contract with 
ptl bankruptcy trustee mc red benton to buy heritage usa for 
115 million and nov 16 is the date benton is to present the 
proposed sale to the court 
as youll observe im stacking everything up to the 16th to 
see what washes out by then reynolds said 
meanwhile benton said the ministrys payroll has continued to 
shrink with about 150 people laid off since labor day including 
about 100 seasonal and temporary employees 
the trustee said the ministrys labor force was down to about 
400 people evenly divided between the forprofit debtor corporation 
holding the ministrys assets and the nonprofit ministry 
the ministry had about 1480 fulltime employees at the time it 
filed for bankruptcy protection

lawmakers complained monday that the 
philippines settled for too little in a pact on us military bases 
and warned the terms could boost those who want the facilities 
closed when the lease expires 
president corazon aquino urged the public to wait for more 
details before judging the new agreement which was signed monday 
afternoon in washington by secretary of state george shultz and the 
philippines foreign secretary raul manglapus 
the pact sets the terms for the remaining two years of the us 
lease on the bases which expires in 1991 under the terms the 
philippines will get 962 million in us aid in exchange for use 
of the bases 
the negotiations were technically a review of an existing bases 
agreement that the aquino government never hinted at canceling but 
tension between the united states and its former colony were high 
because of bargaining over the aid package as well as nuclear and 
other issues 
opposition sen juan ponce enrile said monday the upper chamber 
should have the chance to ratify the agreement as if it were a 
treaty because there are rights and obligations growing from it 
he cited a constitutional provision which says no treaty or 
international agreement shall be valid without the concurrence of 
twothirds of the senate the aquino administration has not 
indicated that the agreement needs senate approval 
sen ernesto maceda chairman of the senate defense committee 
said the accord showed that it seems this administration is not 
ready yet to stand up to washington 
a publicly unacceptable compensation package certainly 
strengthens the hands of those who are batting for no extension of 
the bases lease after 1991 maceda said 
philippine sources have said that manglapus head of the 
philippine negotiating panel originally asked for 12 billion a 
year for use of the two largest us bases abroad the clark air 
base and the subic navy base and four smaller installations 
mrs aquino refused to comment on the agreement saying only 
why dont we just wait until all the details are laid out and 
expressed by secretary manglapus 
she has not said whether she will support extending the 
agreement after 1991 one year before her term ends the 
constitution requires that any extension be approved by twothirds 
of the 23member senate where antibases sentiment is strong 
rep gualberto lumauig of the lower chambers foreign relations 
committee termed the agreement welcome news because it would 
mean more money for the countrys debtstrapped economy 
the agreement represents an increase of 258 million in economic 
and military aid as part of a complicated arrangement that permits 
the philippines to use a substantial portion to reduce its debt 
and bars american soldiers who test positive for aids from serving 
in the country 
but sen wigberto tanada a leading opponent of the bases and 
chief sponsor of the senates antinuclear weapons bill said 
financial compensation was not the only issue 
i dont think it is enough to settle the issue of compensation 
if the threat of national destruction due to nuclear weapons and 
the derogation of national sovereignty is still there he said 
leftwing groups pressing for the dismantling of us facilities 
branded the agreement a sellout and said manglapus should not 
have linked continued us presence here to the debt issue

the communist party chief urged 
yugoslavia on monday to unite behind reform or face destruction 
but a defiant serbian leader defended the mass rallies that are 
fueling ethnic unrest 
worker dissatisfaction over the economy together with ethnic 
discontent have stirred speculation recently about a possible 
military takeover or an eventual breakup of the six republics and 
two autonomous provinces that make up yugoslavia 
defense minister lt gen veljko kadijevic said however it was 
false and malicious to suggest the army should take power 
through a putsch 
the crisis is yugoslavias gravest since world war ii 
a key meeting of the communist partys policysetting central 
committee opened monday with party chief stipe suvar urging 
quarreling leaders to unite behind reform 
all of us in this country are faced with a choice either we 
all resolve the crisis together or we all head to destruction 
suvar warned in a twohour speech 
but serbian party chief slobodan milosevic hailed by supporters 
as the second tito a reference to yugoslavias longtime late 
leader responded with a stinging attack on past inability to 
control the countrys worst postwar economic and social crises 
yugoslavs will not accept another marathon sclerotic 
session that does nothing to ease ethnic tension and economic 
hardship milosevic told the closeddoor session in a speech later 
broadcast on national radio and television 
workers battling a 217 percent inflation rate and austerity 
measures imposed to curb a 21 billion foreign debt have 
increasingly blamed communist leaders for their plight and have 
protested on the streets 
milosevic defended his drive to extend serbian control over its 
two autonomous provinces of vojvodina and kosovo where the serb 
minority alleges harassment at the hands of the ethnic albanian 
majority 
hundreds of thousands of serbs have been rallying to back 
milosevics demands causing unprecedented rifts with communist 
leaders of yugoslavias five other republics 
suvar demanded an end to reckless confrontations and said 
the mass rallies are leading us nowhere 
but milosevic said any banning of the meetings is 
unacceptable and said claims that the rallies fuel unrest are 
sad and shameful 
the nonserbs fear milosevic seeks to boost his national power 
and that of serbia yugoslavias largest republic 
milosevic assured them serbia has no claims to the territory 
of other republics it does have claim to territory in its own 
republic 
vojvodina and kosovo are historically part of serbia 
his speech indicated that rifts that opened up in clashes last 
week with suvar and party chief milan kucan of liberal northern 
slovenia still divide yugoslavias three most important communist 
leaders 
suvar a croat advocated a fundamental renewal of socialism 
and urgent economic and political reforms to solve mounting foreign 
debt and stagnation 
kucan later expressed unreserved support for suvars speech 
milosevic made plain he wants the problem of control over kosovo 
sorted out before economic reform goes ahead 
the meeting was billed as a historic gathering to shake up the 
party leadership 
all the incompetent and compromised people must go and this 
society must be ensured of a perspective suvar said monday 
but no immediate word surfaced on any sweeping personnel changes 
azem vlasi the top ethnic albanian leader from kosovo rejected 
serbian calls to step down 
to date four members of the 23man politburo have said they 
will resign their resignations are expected to be formally 
accepted by the 162member central committee on tuesday 
suvar said last week up to onethird of the central committee 
could be replaced 
few leaders who spoke monday offered any new suggestions to 
solve yugoslavias woes 
kucan however advanced the novel idea of a referendum to test 
the partys popularity in slovenia and denied that the republics 
liberal leadership has no popular support 
the party chief of the republic of montenegro marko orlandic 
attacked the federal government of premier branko mikulic and 
blamed it for for failing to solve the economic crisis 
suvar advocated expanded private ownership increased foreign 
investment and the shutdown of unprofitable state enterprises he 
said key managerial positions limited to communists might be opened 
to nonparty members 
suvar also said a new constitution might be drafted and 
discussed at the next national party congress in 1990 
the constitution adopted in 1974 under josip broz tito created 
a loose confederation many see it as a main cause of the problems 
now because it leaves central power weak

the united states will continue 
withholding some of its dues to the united nations despite 
president reagans pledge last month that they would be paid un 
officials said monday 
the officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 
washington would retain 59 million in dues to force the united 
nations to adopt an austerity budget 
un spokesman fred eckhard said the withholding of funds will 
endanger un peacekeeping projects such as military observers in 
iran and iraq and possible future missions to southwest africa and 
other areas 
reagan told the general assembly on sept 13 that he would 
release the 188 million in dues owed for last year and this year 
and added he was satisfied with the organizations progress on 
budgetary and administrative reforms 
the 188 million is 44 million from the previous fiscal year 
and 144 million for the current fiscal year 
washington paid 15 million in september and on friday it gave 
the united nations 856 million 
that still leaves more than 87 million from the 188 million 
owed reagan had said the full amount would be paid by the end of 
the year 
but the un officials said washington informed un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar that 59 million would be 
frozen until the general assemblys main financial committee the 
fifth committee adopts an austerity budget recommended last month 
by a subcommittee 
even if the united states pays all 188 million it will still 
owe millions more to the world organization in funds withheld 
during earlier years 
fridays payment reduced the us arrears to the regular budget 
to 3663 million and un officials estimate america owes about 
300 million more for unpaid assessments for other projects 
including peacekeeping forces and payments to un special agencies 
reagan last month pledged a multiyear payment plan for all 
the back dues un undersecretarygeneral joseph v reed has said 
the state department told him the payments would be on a 
threetofiveyear plan 
since reagan took office nearly eight years ago his 
administration has harshly criticized the united nation accusing 
it of having an antiwestern bias and of bureaucracy and waste 
the united states is assessed onefourth of the uns regular 
budget and was supposed to pay 212 million this fiscal year but 
congress only appropriated 144 million 
un officials have said that continued withholding of funds 
could force the world body to close in november 
the united nations has no reserve funds and operates by spending 
dues it collects almost as soon as it receives them 
eckhard said so far the united nations has collected only a 
fraction of the 357 million it assessed its members for the first 
three month of operations of the iraniraq military observer group

joint superpower project to monitor damage to the earths ozone 
layer tass said monday 
the soviet news agency quoted the head of a soviet delegation to 
recent superpower talks on space albert chernikov as saying the 
discussions in moscow dealt with the launching of a usmade

aeronautics and space administration confirmed on monday that a 
nasa official is now in the soviet union for discussions on placing

earths ozone layer from space and calculate regional ozone 
depletion especially over antarctica 
the program has been worked out in accordance with the 
agreement reached at the sovietus summit in 1988 on expanding 
cooperation within the framework of the sovietamerican agreement

lead to many frivolous suits and saying they doubted such a plan 
would be politically appealing 
the proposal is designed to resolve disputes quickly with a 
focus on deciding the truth of disputed statements rather than on 
the awarding of damages the centerpiece of the proposal is the 
no fault trial where no damages would be awarded only court 
fees paid by the loser 
while the media would get relief from the prospect of huge 
damage awards they also would give up protections that have 
restricted libel rulings 
although many libel lawyers and media representatives were 
reluctant to embrace the proposal in its entirety they said they 
were encouraged that a panel of 11 lawyers judges journalists and 
others of diverse backgrounds and philosophies could find consensus 
on the thorny issue of libel 
there are a lot of aspects the media side would find 
favorable and im impressed that they could bring together both 
sides and get them to agree on a package of proposed reforms 
said henry r kaufman a new york libel lawyer who also is general 
counsel of the libel research defense center 
but this doesnt break totally new ground some of these 
proposals have been aired before and we know what the reactions 
are likely to be he said on both sides there would be some 
serious reservations 
the study panel was put together by the annenberg washington 
program of northwestern university in evanston ill 
the panels proposal breaks libel action into three stages in 
the first the emphasis is on retraction and replies if a 
newspaper or broadcast station agrees to print or air a retraction 
or a reply by the person complaining about news coverage of them 
then the case is settled and a lawsuit cannot be filed 
if there is no retraction or reply either side can demand that 
a lawsuit be tried for declaratory judgment with the loser 
paying the legal costs of the winner such trials would have to 
begin within 120 days the only issue would be the truth 
regardless of intent or negligence and no damages would be 
awarded 
if neither side wants a declaratory judgment then a lawsuit for 
libel would proceed along a path similar to the current one except 
that damages would be limited to the plaintiffs actual loss 
punitive damages would not be awarded also no one could sue over 
statements of opinion such as an editorial cartoon only facts 
would be considered and at this stage each side would have to pay 
their own legal fees 
kaufman said the libel research defense center which represents 
the media in libel cases does not take positions on such matters 
but speaking as a libel lawyer he said neither libel plaintiffs 
nor the media are likely to work aggressively to push such a 
proposal through 
i have no reason to think plaintiffs lawyers would be 
supportive of something that removes from them the possibility of a 
pot of gold at the end of the libel rainbow he said 
the medias reluctance revolves around the proposed change that 
would eliminate the requirement that public figures suing for libel 
prove that defamatory statements about them were published with 
actual malice meaning with the knowledge that they were false 
or with reckless disregard of whether they were false 
if i were a publisher i wouldnt willingly trade 
constitutional protections for the illusion of some kind of an 
expedited lowcost disputeresolution process said libel lawyer 
richard n winfield with the firm rogers amp wells i wouldnt give 
up constitutional protections lightly 
the american newspaper publishers association declined to 
embrace the proposal but said it deserves careful review 
in a statement anpa president jerry w friedheim said the 
search for the best way to resolve disputes between the news media 
and people who believe they have been wronged in news coverage is 
well worth continuing 
attorney floyd abrams a noted constitutional lawyer said that 
while he would like to see libel reforms any proposal as sweeping 
as the annenberg one should be tested in a small area before it is 
put into practice on a large scale 
the main danger of the proposal is that it could lead to an 
explosion of new libel litigation in which people seek declarations 
that something that was said about them was not true he said 
abrams also was skeptical about the chances for getting such a 
proposal implemented 
i think it will probably take some new disastrous libel case 
before we have any major structural change some enormous verdict 
in some highly publicized case he said

the american society of newspaper editors on 
monday criticized the south african government for consistent and 
arbitrary censorship of the press in that country 
the asne in a letter to south african president pw botha 
expressed urgent concern over a warning issued to the weekly 
mail by stoffel botha minister of home affairs and communications 
the action reinforces the fear we expressed in our last 
communication that it is the intention of the government to 
cripple one by one any inconvenient publication bill kovach 
chairman of the asne international communication committee said in 
the letter 
censorship for whatever reason is repugnant to any people but 
it is especially so to those who profess to have some voice in 
governing themselves said kovach editor of the atlanta journal 
and constitution 
at this most critical time in the spread of the notion of a 
free press in the world it is especially deplorable that the 
government of south africa chooses to continue its course down the 
road of darkness and fear kovach wrote 
he urged the south african government not to take further steps 
against the weekly mail and to restore the right to publish to 
other publications that have been shut down

the pilot of a uganda airlines jet tried three times 
to land in thick fog at romes main airport before the boeing 707 
crashed into houses and trees early monday killing 31 of the 52 
people aboard authorities reported 
the fog a possible misunderstanding between pilot and 
control tower at leonardo da vinci airport and lack of 
sophisticated equipment on a seldomused runway were cited as 
suspected factors in the crash 
all 21 survivors were hospitalized many in critical condition 
with burns fractures and shock only one of seven crew members a 
steward survived 
wreckage was strewn for half a mile but only one injury was 
reported on the ground 
rome police headquarters spokesman paolo moscarelli said late 
monday that one passenger died in a hospital raising the death 
toll to 31 
among survivors was british dairy farmer geoffrey gait who said 
he and his wife ruth who was holding their 8monthold son jumped 
from the wreckage right before it went up in flames the family 
suffered slight burns 
the jet missed the runway by several hundred yards it tore 
through a wooden house clipped a garage demolished a brick house 
under construction and plowed through the parking lot of a car 
rental agency where an engine and a wing tore off and a fire 
destroyed 75 cars according to authorities 
an occupant of the wooden house carlo satta 30 was hit on the 
nose by a beam as he slept in bed in fiumicino 21 miles southwest 
of rome 
flight no 775 began at londons gatwick airport late sunday and 
was bound for entebbe uganda with a onehour stopover scheduled 
in rome 
most of those aboard were ugandans the british embassy in rome 
said the passenger list included seven or eight british citizens 
two nigerians were listed among the injured 
airport authorities said monday evening they did not have a list 
of the dead by name and nationality 
alberto di giulio head of the national flight safety office 
said the jet tried to land three times at the seaside airport 
before it crashed 
passenger john harigye a former ugandan ambassador to the 
vatican told reporters from his hospital bed that a flight 
attendant told him just before the crash that the plane tried once 
to land had to circle because of the fog and was about to try 
another landing 
he said that next came a violent collision and he found himself 
upside down in his seat held by his seatbelt 
i realized one side of the plane was gone i pushed through a 
hole helping a family friend seated near him to leave the plane 
he said 
outside the jet i saw a woman who was calling me she knew 
me i told her to move away then the plane exploded said 
harigye whose hand bandage was soaked with blood the fuel 
apparently ignited after the crash 
guido chiucini commander of rome provinces fire department 
speculated in a telephone interview that a misunderstanding may 
have developed between the control tower and the pilot since the 
landing was begun at a very low altitude 
chiucini who helped coordinate the rescue did not elaborate 
later the air traffic controllers union denied there was a 
misunderstanding 
asked about chiucinis remarks di giulio said the tapes of 
cockpit conversation had yet to be reviewed 
since sunday evening a heavy fog had enveloped the rome 
seacoast including the airport 
the fog appears to have been the main culprit di giulio 
said 
without citing its sources rai state television said the pilot 
began the third attempt too low italys ansa news agency said the 
pilot had approached from three different directions because of 
shifting fog banks 
andrea gariup of italys main pilots union was quoted by rai 
as saying the runway on which the pilot tried to land lacked 
sophisticated equipment to help in instrument landings and was not 
normally used 
authorities reported both the flight instrument data recordings 
and the recordings of conversations between cockpit and tower were 
recovered 
gait said he was involved in a charity project to provide uganda 
farmers with cows 
he told the associated press in an interview at santeugenio 
hospital that he heard the planes wheels come up go down and then 
go up again moments before impact 
the flames came through the cabin my wife says i dont 
remember we jumped out of a hole in the fuselage behind us 
ruth jumped backward holding baby richard to her chest and then 
fell about six feet to the ground i picked them up we walked 
about 200 yards and then some ugandans came out 
the three gaits were expected to be discharged by wednesday

a bacterial illness linked to food served on 
at least eight northwest airlines flights since sept 15 may 
ultimately affect passengers on more than 120 northwest flights a 
state official said monday 
we have received hundreds of calls as this has hit the 
national media state epidemiologist michael osterholm said at a 
news conference some complaints have come from as far as japan and 
east germany which are on northwests flight routes he said 
confirmed cases of the illness shigellosis have been found 
among passengers who flew with the airline as late as oct 12 
osterholm said its not clear if food now being served on northwest 
planes is safe 
i cant confirm that it is safe and i cant say it isnt he 
said 
the disease causes intense diarrhea and other symptoms that can 
last for five to seven days it spreads easily from person to 
person of people exposed to the bacteria about 10 percent usually 
get sick osterholm said 
all the illnesses confirmed so far have been traced to food 
prepared in marriott corps airline kitchen at the minneapolisst 
paul international airport the facility serves 100000 meals a 
week for northwest 
the investigation began after 21 minnesota vikings became ill 
after eating food prepared for a flight to an oct 2 football game 
in miami 
investigators initially focused on the possibility that 
ingredients in the meals may have been contaminated or that one or 
more sick food preparers transmitted the bacteria and osterholm 
say the latter now appears more likely 
shigellosis has been confirmed in passengers on eight flights 
from the twin cities of minneapolisst paul to detroit miami 
nashville tenn newark nj seattle and st louis two flight 
attendants are among those confirmed as having been infected 
osterholm said its probable that several hundred passengers 
on more than 120 additional flights may have been affected 
the minnesota health department has set up extra telephone lines 
to receive calls from people who believe they may have been 
infected 
were working around the clock here literally osterholm

sen lloyd bentsen stalking reagan 
democrats on the texasarkansas border scoffed monday at 
republican charges that democratic nominee michael dukakis favors 
harsh gun controls and would weaken the military 
i saw those ads about mike dukakis going to take the guns away 
from you confiscate the guns not even pay for them bentsen 
told 200 supporters at an airport rally during a refueling stop on 
his way to california 
let me tell you a fella like lloyd bentsen likes to go quail 
hunting like i do said the democratic vice presidential 
candidate i sure wouldnt be running with any fella if i 
thought he was going to take my shotgun away from me no way 
while dukakis does support gun control bentsen said he 
believes sportsmen should have guns and people have the right to 
defend their homes he said gop nominee george bush was the only 
one of the four candidate who has voted for national gun control 
as a congressman in 1968 
bentsen said it was untrue that the democrats wanted to cut 
defense spending he scorned republican commercials on the defense 
issue featuring former test pilot chuck yeager 
the texas senator said yeager should return to writing books and 
lobbying for a defense contractor and stay out of politics 
later in california bentsen told a crowd of several thousand 
students at the university of california at san diego that the 
republicans were squandering americas technological future 
in 1980 he said 60 percent of color televisions sold in 
america were made in the united states today less than 10 percent 
are and the united states makes no video cassette recorders 
compact disc players or fax machines 
he also decried what he said were republican distortions of 
dukakis record invoking as he did over the weekend the image of 
harry trumans comefrombehind campaign 
it was harry truman who said that you have to appeal to the 
best instincts of people not to their worst he told the crowd 
few of whom were born when truman was in the white house 
sometimes you can win a few elections that way but you really 
hurt your country 
well some of you recall when harry truman ran for 
reelection he had a very arrogant opponent that knew hed won 
it bentsen said referring to thomas e dewey but the people 
kept yelling to harry harry give em hell but harry would say 
i just tell the truth and the republicans think its hell 
well mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen are offering the truth 
he said 
bentsens texarkana stopover was aimed at both east texas and 
arkansas which are strong in loyal democrats but where the party 
has been struggling to reverse its sagging fortunes in the 
bushdukakis presidential race 
bentsen has refused to concede texas although the democratic 
ticket is more than 10 points behind bush and running mate dan 
quayle in some polls the contest is closer in arkansas but the 
democrats have suffered there 
rep tommy robinson dark said last week that dukakis was 
not welcome in his district 
rep bill alexander dark rode to texarkana with bentsen on 
the campaign jet and told reporters that his state was still there 
for dukakis to win if he improves his organization and his message 
alexander said favorite dukakisbentsen topics such as world 
trade are too esoteric for many arkansas voters 
so far alexander said the massachusetts governor has proved to 
be a disappointing campaigner who is unwilling to exploit issues 
where republicans are vulnerable such as the war on drugs 
hes got to show some passion commitment leadership 
alexander said he may have made an aplus in political science 
but so far he hasnt passed politics 
he could capture the hearts and minds of the people of the 
south in the next three weeks if hed come out swinging he said 
he can do it someones gotta get him off in the corner grab 
him and tell him what to do

george bush signaling he wont sit on his lead in the 
campaigns final weeks returned to the attack monday and said 
michael dukakis should stop running down our defenses dukakis 
charged bush with ignoring the nations loss of industrial jobs 
battling the notion that he is slipping hopelessly behind the 
democratic presidential nominee stopped at a factory a diner and a 
bowling alley as he began a campaing swing through industrial 
states he said bush sat on his hands while americas industrial 
heartland has been fighting for its life 
dukakis was confronted with an nbc newswall street journal poll 
showing bush has opened a huge lead 55 percent to 38 percent 
nationally since their final debate last thursday 
well i can only tell you that there are other polls that say 
very different things about where we are and where the race is 
dukakis told an interviewer for a chicago television station 
now weve got a new set of numbers that has absolutely no 
relationship to anything that we have or other polls have so you 
spend two or three days answering answering questions about it 
he said 
the poll was conducted friday trough sunday among 1378 likely 
voters and found even half of dukakis own supporters expected 
bush to win 
dukakis running mate lloyd bentsen launched an attack on bush 
in the south as the only one of the four candidates who has voted 
for national gun control he referred to a 1968 vote while bush 
was in congress 
with three weeks left in the presidential race aides to dukakis 
said he would seek to sharpen the differences between himself and 
the vice president particularly on economic issues 
but as he arrived in ohio a big state crucial to his chances a 
new statewide poll by the akron beacon journal showed bush holding 
a doubledigit lead 
bush buoyant but cautioning against overconfidence toured a 
denverarea defense plant where star wars research is conducted he 
then spoke at the dedication of a holocaust memorial in skokie 
ill where he said the relationship between israel and the 
united states has never been better 
he used the denver setting to say dukakis has a total lack of 
understanding of our military and is trying desperately to jump 
into the mainstream by acknowledging a need to modernize 
landbased nuclear missiles 
but there is strong reason to doubt that he would do it 
bush said he still opposes the mx and he thinks the midgetman 
costs too much so he says hes going to work with congress to find 
another way 
wake up governor bush said weve done all that 
he defended the reagan administrations record on conventional 
forces against dukakis past charges that such forces have been 
slighted in the push for new bigticket strategic weapons systems 
bush dismissed that as misinformation 
governor its time to stop running down our defenses he 
said 
he also ridiculed dukakis for supporting some research into star 
wars while dismissing the proposed spacebased missiledefense 
system as a fantasy 
dukakis and his campaign staff were embracing the idea of 
running as the underdog to underscore his resolve dukakis said 
my spirits are good and took trumpet in hand to play happy 
days are here again a democratic standard 
dukakis declared he was fighting for the values i believe 
in and in a touch of populism told workers at a copper and 
brass plant i want to be the president who stands up and fights 
for you 
he pointed to recent trade figures showing imports to the united 
states were at an alltime high in august and said bush has not 
given the american people a clue as to what he would do to 
reverse the trade deficit 
george bush sat on the sidelines for eight years while america 
got beaten in world markets while a piece of america was being 
sold off every day at bargainbasement prices he said 
he also disputed bushs standard speech line that he wants a 
kinder gentler nation 
his record tells rural america the fewer family farmers the 
better his record tells middle class families the glory days are 
over your kids may not do as well as you dukakis said 
bentsen trying to save some of the south for the democrats 
said dukakis was not planning cuts in defense spending and defended 
him against television ads playing in the south that hit dukakis as 
an advocate of gun control 
i sure wouldnt be running with any fellow if i thought he was 
going to take my shotgun away from me bentsen said in texarkana 
on the texasarkansas border 
republican vice presidential nominee dan quayle dropped in 
unannounced at a flint mich burger king restaurant where he 
talked about sports and woodburning stoves over coffee with 
customers 
he also took a page from dukakis campaign book by pledging 
good jobs at good wages the phrase dukakis has used since the 
primaries 
in a series of stops across michigan where the auto industry 
has been hard hit by foreign competition quayle called for fair 
free trade without resorting to protectionist barriers 
meanwhile bush won the endorsement of the teamsters executive 
board monday after a poll of the nations largest union gave him a 
fourpoint margin over dukakis union officials said 
just 21207 members of the 17 millionstrong teamsters voted in 
the poll said union president william j mccarthy who is from 
massachusetts and has been critical of the governor 
the union has not endorsed a democrat for president since 1968 
but had a falling out with the republican reagan administration in 
1986 over the indictment of union president jackie presser 
the union would endorse neither quayle nor the republican party 
however 
the bush campaign meanwhile has begun a new television ad 
saying bush would be more qualified to negotiate with soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev this is not time to train somebody in how 
to meet with the russians the ad says this is the time for 
somebody whos ready on day one to be president 
the 30second ad began running over the weekend

labor party leader shimon peres said 
monday that if he is elected prime minister in nov 1 elections 
palestinians in the occupied territories will elect delegates to 
peace talks with israel 
peres spoke on a day when 16 palestinians were reported shot in 
clashes with troops in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
also monday two israeli soldiers were wounded one seriously 
apparently from a palestinian firebomb attack an army spokesman 
said he said the circumstances of the incident in the west bank 
village of azzun were unclear and still under investigation 
a homemade bomb was thrown on monday at police guarding the 
home of former defense minister ariel sharon in the moslem sector 
of the walled old city police said they said no injury or damage 
resulted and that the attacker escaped despite police gunfire 
it was the second unsuccessful attack on the house in less than 
a month 
sharon now industry minister was away on a private visit to 
hungary 
peres said balloting in the territories would be held only if 
calm is restored 
if the violence is restrained we will hold free elections in 
judea samaria and gaza so that a palestinian delegation can be 
elected to represent the palestinian side in negotiations peres 
said using the biblical names for the west bank 
the suggestion was rejected by several palestinian leaders 
including israelideposed hebron mayor mustafa natsche he told the 
associated press that before any elections israel must recognize 
our right to selfdetermination and our right to choose our own 
representatives 
prime minister yitzhak shamir whose hardline likud bloc is 
labors main opponent said nothing will remain of palestinian 
protesters if they carry out threats to use weapons against israel 
likud opposes giving back any of the territories occupied by 
israel since the 1967 middle east war labor favors trading some 
land for peace 
polls say the two major parties are in a close race much of the 
campaigning has centered on the palestinian uprising which has 
claimed the lives of 299 arabs and six israelis since dec 8 
defense minister yitzhak rabin a labor party member who joined 
peres at a news conference to announce the peace talk election 
proposal said palestinian representatives must be chosen from 
residents of the territories by residents of the territories 
rabin said any resident of the territories could run in the 
elections but he said at least three months of calm would have to 
precede the balloting 
the last elections in the west bank were mayoral elections in 
1976 under a labor administration the elected officials supported 
the palestine liberation organization and refused to participate in 
peace negotiations 
peres said that if formal peace negotiations fail he would 
transfer local and municipal affairs now handled by the army to 
elected palestinians 
peres continues to insist that jordan be part of any peace talks 
despite king husseins statement this summer that he was breaking 
all links with the west bank which jordan held from 1948 until 
1967 
peres is trying to win the votes of israeli arabs who comprise 
17 percent of the electorate and traditionally split their votes 
between labor and the communist party 
avi pazner a spokesman for shamir criticized the labor 
proposal and said holding elections during the uprising would only 
serve to give radicals the upper hand 
among the casualties monday were four palestinians in the nablus 
area including a 13yearold boy who was shot in the back after 
youths hurled rocks at troops an arab reporter said 
in the gaza strip troops shot eight youths with plastic bullets 
and wounded four with live ammunition during stonethrowing clashes 
in four palestinian refugee camps arab reports and hospital 
officials said one of the wounded was a 13yearold boy hit in the 
eye with a plastic bullet the officials said 
the army said it was checking the reports 
israel radio quoted an army medical officer as saying 575 
soldiers and 321 israeli civilians have been injured in the 
uprising most were hit by stones 
israeli officials have said more than 7000 palestinians have 
been injured in the revolt

a federal grand jury indicted rep pat swindall 
on perjury charges monday accusing the twoterm republican 
congressman of lying during a money laundering investigation 
swindall locked in what has been called one of the countrys 
dirtiest congressional reelection battles pleaded innocent to all 
counts during an afternoon arraignment and was free on his own 
recognizance 
he said he hoped to bring the case to trial next monday in order 
to clear his name by the nov 8 general election 
when i am exonerated obviously the only issue that remains is 
whether the 4th district wants a dukakis liberal or a bush 
conservative he told reporters at us district court 
swindall said he would resign if he were convicted of the 
charges even though not required to by law he said he expects to 
serve a jail term if found guilty 
he said he would step down because under the circumstances i 
dont think it would be fair to the voters of the 4th district to 
remain in office 
his democratic opponent former dukes of hazzard television 
actor ben jones commented i feel concern for the congressman 
and for his family at this point it is a matter for the courts 
to decide 
the 10count indictment accused swindall of lying to the grand 
jury last feb 2 during its investigation of a proposed 850000 
home mortgage loan the congressman had discussed with an atlanta 
businessman and an undercover agent posing as a financier 
among other things the indictment charged that swindall lied 
when he told the grand jury he did not go to authorities to report 
the loan negotiations because he said i never satisfied myself 
of anything with respect to criminality 
the indictment also charged swindall lied when he said there had 
never been discussions about trying to conceal the trail of the 
money and that he lied when he denied having been specifically 
informed by the undercover agent that the source of the loan could 
be illicit drug money 
us attorney robert barr said that if convicted swindall could 
be sentenced to five years in prison and fined 10000 on each 
count 
swindall who had been notified of the pending indictment in 
advance announced sunday night that he expected to be indicted and 
said he was excited by the prospect because it would give him a 
chance to clear his name 
he said he would waive a number of rights including the right 
to charge the government with misconduct so the case could go to 
trial next monday swindall said he would act as his own attorney 
swindall entered his innocent plea before us magistrate 
william l harper who then assigned the case to us district 
judge robert vining 
vining had previously been scheduled to try atlanta businessman 
charles lechasney and a second person accused of money laundering 
next monday harper said there were indications lechasney and the 
second man might step aside and allow swindalls case to be tried 
ahead of their cases 
swindall who defeated jones in 1986 this year has made an 
issue of jones arrest record including a conviction for 
assaulting his wife jones has said the incidents occurred during a 
bout with alcoholism that ended in 1977 
jones who starred as cooter in the longrunning television 
series the dukes of hazzard once suggested that swindall 
submit to drug tests insinuating the congressmans behavior was 
unstable 
the indictment stems from negotiations swindall undertook last 
year with lechasney to finance a mortgage loan for his 12 million 
home 
lechasney who has since been indicted on moneylaundering 
charges introduced swindall to michael mullaney an undercover 
internal revenue service agent posing as a money broker 
in june atlanta newspapers obtained several secretly made 
government tape recordings of conversations among swindall 
lechasney and the undercover agent 
the tapes showed that swindall continued to pursue negotiations 
for an 850000 loan after being told that the source might be drug 
money he would be helping to launder 
he accepted a 150000 check as the first installment on the 
loan but returned it uncashed three days later saying he was 
suspicious of lechasneys business dealings 
swindall has since apologized for his role in the negotiations 
calling it a mistake in judgment but insisting there was no 
wrongdoing

leaders of the teamsters the nations 
largest union voted monday to back george bush for president 
breaking with the aflcios endorsement of michael dukakis 
however union president william j mccarthy emphasized that the 
endorsement applied only to bush personally not his running mate 
dan quayle nor the republican party 
the action came after only 21207 of the unions 17 million 
members returned mailin presidential ballots giving bush a 502 
percent to 464 percent margin over his democratic rival said 
mccarthy 
he said the union would have backed dukakis if the membership 
poll had gone the other way but he applauded the decision to back 
bush 
we feel he is more qualified and can do a greater job for this 
country mccarthy said after the unions 18member board of 
directors ratified the membership vote during a meeting at the 
grenelefe resort we feel we can get a fair shake from him 
reacting to the snub while campaigning in midland mich quayle 
said the important thing is that they endorsed george bush and 
thats good news for me 
its going to be important to have their votes quayle said 
the union president insisted that the poll was fair despite the 
small number of voters saying all members had the opportunity to 
register their opinions 
the teamsters have not backed a democrat for president since 
vice president humbert h humphrey in 1968 
but when the union rejoined the aflcio a year ago following a 
30year absence officials for both had anticipated the teamsters 
would go along with the federations expected endorsement of the 
democratic nominee 
the deal apparently fell through when mccarthy took over the 
union following the death of jackie presser 
the aflcio announced its endorsement of dukakis in august and 
the teamsters were one of three unions that abstained while 88 
unions supported it 87 of them unanimously 
teamster officials said then they expected the union to make no 
endorsement a stand the teamsters last took in 1976 when jimmy 
carter defeated incumbent president gerald ford 
mccarthy who headed the teamsters in new england before taking 
over the union had crossed swords with dukakis in massachusetts 
backing his electoral opponents there 
but he denied monday that the bush endorsement was intended to 
spite dukakis 
i have no opinion of him mccarthy said of the governor 
union spokesman duke zeller said the vote indicated teamsters 
are satisfied with the economy because they are concerned with 
such breadandbutter issues as jobs 
the teamsters endorsed ronald reagan in 1980 and 1984 but the 
union had a falling out with the administration in 1986 over 
pressers indictment 
when he died in july after a long bout with cancer and heart 
disease presser was under indictment in cleveland for allegedly 
hiring ghost employees for the union 
the union is also the target of a federal civil racketeering 
suit that was filed june 28 that suit seeks to have teamsters 
officials who violated racketeering laws removed from office and 
replaced with a trustee

a malfunctioning fan in a 
plutoniumprocessing area caused the evacuation of about 100 
employees at the savannah river plant monday but officials said 
there was no contamination of the workers or the atmosphere 
the fan broke down at 246 pm and was restarted about 30 
minutes later said plant spokesman cliff webb the cause of the 
equipment failure was under investigation 
the exhaust fan is used to pull fresh air from the outside 
through the building and out to filters that trap any radioactive 
material the air flow serves to remove any releases of 
contamination from the building 
but a fan failure could produce a reverse air flow which could 
allow contamination to accumulate in the building or be forced 
outside 
the amount of contamination would depend on how much plutonium 
was being processed when such an accident occurred officials will 
not discuss specifics on plutonium production 
a backup fan normally would have been activated but the second 
unit was out of service for routine maintenance webb said 
meanwhile about 700 employees elsewhere in farea where 
plutonium is refined for use in nuclear weapons were detained 
about an hour while an inventory of nuclear materials was 
completed such inventories are routinely conducted webb said

a national poll monday said george bush held a 
17point lead in the presidential race garnering 55 percent 
support among likely voters compared with 38 percent for democrat 
michael dukakis 
bushs lead in the nbc newswall street journal poll was his 
greatest of the campaign and considerably greater than in surveys 
earlier this month it was the first fullsized poll conducted 
after last weeks debate 
bush led by 10 points in smaller overnight polls done 
immediately after thursdays debate but they were conducted only 
among debate viewers a more republican group he led by five or 
six points in most predebate polls 
in the nbcjournal poll conducted friday through sunday among 
1378 likely voters almost threequarters said they expected bush 
to win the election including half of dukakis own supporters 
dukakis and campaign chairman paul brountas disputed the 
figures as did running mate lloyd bentsen 
now weve got a new set of numbers that has absolutely no 
relationship to anything that we have or other polls have so you 
spend two or three days answering answering questions about it 
dukakis said 
if there has been an increase in the gap it may be 
attributable to some of the stories about the debate brountas 
said 
i dont think its accurate said bentsen you see wide 
fluctuations among those polls thats whats happening 
dukakis campaign received two blows last week a 50state poll 
by abc news and the washington post said bush had an overwhelming 
lead in the race for electoral votes and polls said bush was seen 
as the debate winner 
bush was favorably rated by 55 percent in the nbcjournal poll 
up from 50 percent a month ago dukakis favorability rating 
dropped to 36 percent down from 50 percent a month ago 
bushs advantage was chiefly among men they backed him by a 21 
margin 6430 while the race among women was a nearly even 4844 
a gender gap has been apparent to varying degrees throughout the 
campaign 
the polls margin of error was plus or minus three percentage 
points

choreographer rallou manou widely 
recognized for introducing modern dance in greece has died of a 
stroke at the age of 73 
ms manou who directed the hellenic chorodrama that she helped 
set up with leading greek artists in 1951 died saturday 
the daughter of a wealthy greek army officer ms manou studied 
dance in west germany before working under american modern dance 
pioneer martha graham at new york university in the 1940s 
works presented by the hellenic chorodrama of which ms manou 
was the principal choreographer blended avantgarde dance forms 
with classical drama 
she insisted that the dance group which performed each summer 
in the openair lycabettus theater in athens be inspired by greek 
tradition 
i dont think ballet is the kind type or spirit of dance that 
can best express greece she once said modern dance is the 
best form and also the one which comes nearest to ancient greek

michael dukakis reached for the common touch 
on monday visiting a metal factory a diner and a bowling alley as 
he tried to reinvigorate a faltering presidential campaign 
i want to be a president who stands up and fights for american 
companies american products and american workers dukakis said 
depicting republican rival george bush as the candidate of 
complacency 
the massachusetts governor embraced the role of underdog as 
polls in ohio and elsewhere showed him losing ground since last 
weeks presidential debate 
an nbc wall street journal poll reported bush leading 55 percent 
to 38 percent but dukakis disputed the fundings 
well i can only tell you that there are other polls that say 
very different things about where we are and where the race is 
dukakis told an interviewer for a chicago television station 
dukakis in a series of interviews described the race as very 
tight and said the business of polls is really having a 
terrible effect on the campaign process 
now weve got a new set of numbers that has absolutely no 
relationship to anything that we have or other polls have so you 
spend two or three days answering answering questions about it 
he declined to say what his internal campaign polling shows 
the governors day was designed to counter criticism that he has 
failed to connect emotionally with middle class voters 
particularly those in the industrial states 
dukakis ended his day more than 12 hours after he began at a 
rally in columbus attended by blacks and he took a veiled shot at 
bush something is very wrong when a presidential candidate calls 
jesse helms a hero and jesse jackson a hustler he said bush 
once used that term to describe jackson in a newspaper interview 
his first stop was a brass and copper factory in euclid near 
cleveland where he toured the plant wearing a jacket that bore two 
pocket patches one saying mike and the other next 
president 
addressing workers at a factoryfloor rally he criticized bush 
for opposing increases in the minimum wage and for advocating a 
trade policy that he said seemed like a rerun of lets make a 
deal 
he said bush has sat on his hands while americas industrial 
heartland has been fighting for its life 
next was a brief visit to shortys diner in cleveland where he 
joined a patron and his daughter at a booth lets kick some ass 
out there said the man tim lachina ok very good well do 
it said dukakis 
in dayton he went to a bowling alley for a meeting with 
families many of whom said they were worried about the threat of 
drugs and concerned about meeting the costs of higher education 
in his factory speech he said bush assures the voters 
everythings fine not to worry 
but his record sends a very different message his record 
tells americas industrial heartland let it rust dukakis said 
the massachusetts governor told reporters my spirits are 
good as he set out on a campaign swing through industrial states 
and he twice took trumpet in hand to make a stab at a few bars of 
happy days are here again 
but the political news for dukakis was anything but happy as 
newspaper polls in the wake of last weeks presidential debate 
indicated bush holds a doubledigit lead in ohio dukakis is 
expected to return two or three times before election day to the 
state one of several in the northeast and midwest that form the 
core of his hopes for a comefrombehind victory in the race for 
the white house 
dukakis has decided to campaign as the underdog he is for the 
final three weeks of the campaign and in his new campaign speech 
he said he is fighting for the values i believe in the values 
that are at the core of this campaign 
he said bush has sat on his hands while americas heartland 
has been fighting for its life and now wont be specific about 
what he would do as president 
take trade for example mr bushs trade policy is like a 
rerun of lets make a deal letting the voters guess whats 
behind door no 1 door no 2 and door no 3 dukakis said 
george bush sat on the sidelines for eight years while america 
got beaten in world markets while a piece of america was being 
sold off every day at bargainbasement prices he said 
dukakis said he would work hard to create good jobs at good 
wages adding thats not just a slogan that comes from the 
gut 
bush says he believes in the dignity of work dukakis noted but 
he said the vice president opposed legislation mandating a 60day 
notice to workers before their factory could be closed and voted 
for a budget plan that would have frozen social security 
costofliving increases 
mr bush saw nothing said nothing and did nothing while 
his republican colleagues in congress used every trick in the book 
to keep the minimum wage a poverty wage of 335 an hour he 
said 
dukakis taunted bushs oftrepeated declaration that he wants a 
kinder gentler nation 
his record tells rural america the fewer family farmers the 
better his record tells middle class families the glory days are 
over your kids may not do as well as you

a man who barricaded himself in his apartment 
building shot and killed two police officers monday before he was 
killed by police to end the nearly sevenhour siege authorities 
said 
relatives said the gunman identified as charles knowles was 
distraught because he had been beaten and robbed sunday night 
police spokesman fred zaharoff said knowles 50 had a history of 
mental instability 
police went to the threestory apartment building about 8 am 
after receiving reports that knowles had threatened other tenants 
and was pouring gasoline inside the building said zaharoff 
knowles fired through the door of his apartment about 930 am 
striking lt james l schmit in the chest zaharoff said schmit 
died at samaritan hospital after surgery for a chest wound 
hospital spokeswoman kay lemon said 
negotiations with knowles continued while about 25 families in 
and near the apartment building were kept from their homes 
zaharoff said 
exhaustive attempts by police officers and members of the 
knowles family to talk him into surrendering were of no avail 
the spokesman said the decision to enter the dwelling was made 
after considering the fact that mr knowles had poured gasoline 
through the apartment building which may have been ignited as 
children were about to be dismissed from schools in the area 
the polices special response unit forced their way into 
knowless apartment about 205 pm zaharoff said knowles fired 
as they entered and struck officer frank e walls who died about 
30 minutes later at st john hospital officials said 
other officers returned fire and killed knowles instantly 
zaharoff said 
schmit 41 was a 20year veteran and walls 39 was a 13year 
veteran 
the gunmans nephew rick knowles said his uncle was retired 
lived alone and had been a victim of other crimes in recent months 
charles knowless apartment had been burglarized several months 
ago after police took him into custody rick knowles said the 
nephew said he did not know what offense was involved in that 
arrest but added that charles knowles had bought a rifle afterward 
the police came in today he probably said leave me alone 
rick knowles said they tried to get in anyway and he just 
popped them

three young whales trapped by ice were 
battered and bleeding and appeared to be weakening monday while a 
huge military helicopter prepared to tow an icebreaking barge 
hundreds of miles in a lastditch effort to free them 
rescuers used chain saws to keep two small breathing holes open 
in the sixinch thick arctic ocean ice but freezing temperatures 
threatened to close them the whales became trapped nearly two 
weeks ago while migrating south to warmer waters 
the endangered california gray whales about 24 to 30 feet long 
were bleeding and battered from continually bashing into the jagged 
ice and were exhausted from swimming against the ocean current to 
remain in place 
they dont look as spry their movements are diminished ron 
morris of the national marine fisheries service said monday 
their condition has worsened since they were first spotted 
one has a little pneumonia but the others are all right but 
theres no question in my mind that theyll be here when the 
vehicle arrives said morris 
the whales were trapped about 18 miles northeast of this inupiat 
eskimo village they were only a few hundred feet offshore in 45 
feet of water with their largest breathing hole about 10 feet by 
20 feet 
the whales ordinarily can stay underwater nearly four minutes 
said geoff carroll a wildlife biologist with the north slope 
borough carroll said they have been surfacing about every two 
minutes indicating they were becoming tired and stressed 
rescuers were racing against onshore winds that threatened to 
close leads in the ice that would serve as the whales escape route 
if the icebreaking barge is able to free them 
environmentalists federal authorities and the oil industry have 
joined in an unlikely alliance to rush a barge to the whales so 
that it can smash a path to open water some seven miles away 
a spindly army national guard ch54 skycrane planned to lift off 
from prudhoe bay to tow the 185ton barge 200 miles northwest to 
the beleaguered whales the trip was expected to take from 25 to 40 
hours 
crews labored aroundtheclock during the weekend to get the 
barge and the skycrane ready to go the vessel a hovercrafttype 
barge belongs to veco inc an oil field service company 
crews were being especially cautious as they prepared the rig 
monday 
were checking under the rig checking the airbags and 
checking anything that can go wrong said pete leathard a veco 
spokesman were not going to move that thing until we can make 
sure well have a clean run to barrow the arctic is not a good 
place to break down in winter 
plans called for the helicopter to pull the 85by60foot barge 
with an 800foot cable said mike haller spokesman for the alaska 
national guard 
the plan has great potential for danger because of the atitude 
of the helicopter in the towing position the nose is down he 
said the danger is that if a line snaps and comes back up and 
gets in the rotors weve got real trouble 
the helicopter which costs 1500 to 3000 an hour to operate 
will trade off with a second skycrane which has been flown to 
prudhoe bay the barge carried 20000 gallons of fuel for the 
helicopters and the barge haller said the fuel was provided by 
arco alaska inc 
oil company officials have estimated the rescue effort could 
cost as much as 500000 
greenpeace representative cindy lowry arrived in barrow on 
sunday with recordings of migrating whales which she wants to play 
along the ice floe to lure the whales to safety 
the population of endangered california gray whales numbers 
about 20000 and has been growing at an annual average of 25 
percent for the past decade authorities said 
the whales spend their winters in the warm waters off mexico and 
southern california

the united states and the philippines 
concluded an agreement monday to guarantee us military use of 
strategic air and naval bases in the southeast asian country 
through 1991 in exchange for 962 million in american aid 
that represents an increase of 258 million in economic and 
military assistance as part of a complicated arrangement that 
permits the philippines to use a substantial portion to reduce 
its debt and bars american soldiers who test positive for aids from 
serving in the country 
the successful conclusion of what at times had been difficult 
negotiations could foreshadow extension of the us military 
presence in the strategic asian nation beyond 1991 but the terms 
will have to be negotiated between the two sides probably 
beginning next year 
another key provision of the agreement which was released as 
secretary of state george p shultz and foreign secretary raul 
manglapus signed the pact maintains the us policy of not 
disclosing whether ships or planes stopping at the bases or passing 
through carry nuclear weapons 
these transits overflights or visits will be conducted in 
accordance with existing procedures which may be changed or 
modified as necessary by mutual agreement of both parties the 
memorandum said 
however the philippines government has the power to prohibit 
storing nuclear chemical or other nonconventional weaponry on its 
territory 
the nuclear issue was one of the key items that had to be 
settled before the united states could be assured continued use of 
clark air base subic bay naval base and four lesser installations 
the accord also deeds to the philippines all permanent 
facilities and improvements on buildings at the bases the two 
governments pledged meanwhile to take steps to ensure a smooth 
transition of the bases to philippine control if the united states 
decides in the future to abandon them 
in a ceremony in the state departments treaty room manglapus 
said that once filipinos realize what the agreement gives them 
they will accept it as an agreement that is in keeping with the 
expectations of our people not only in the matter of compensation 
but also to other issues that we feel to be relevant to the 
question of national dignity 
the agreement covers only the next two years a us statement 
said the united states hoped to begin talks with the philippines 
government on use beyond 1991 in not too distant future 
manglapus said the review does not resolve issues of criminal 
jurisdiction and military operations which are likely to come up 
in the next talks the philippines wants jurisdicton over us 
soldiers who commit crimes and prior notice on any us military 
operations conducted from the bases 
manglapus said president corazon aquino would be influenced on 
the future of the bases by filipinos reaction to the agreement but 
was keeping her options open 
shultz quipped both sides are keeping their options open 
he said the united states was just thrilled with the return 
of democracy in the philippines and takes great pleasure and 
satisfaction with developments in manila 
im bullish on the phillipines and this is a continuation of 
that effort shultz said 
the agreement set the terms for us use of the bases through 
1991 technically the negotiations were a review of an existing 
bases agreement that the aquino government never hinted at 
canceling but the bargaining over the us aid package the 
nuclear issue and other key features contributed to a dramatic and 
politically tense chapter in us relations with the former 
american colony 
president reagan on monday wrote mrs aquino in a threepage 
letter released at the ceremony that the agreement confirmed that 
the bases arrangement continues to meet our mutual needs and 
interests 
but he reminded the philippine president that congress has the 
authority to appropriate the aid covered in the accord 
military and economic aid to the philippines is to be boosted to 
481 million a year that is more than 2 times the 180 million a 
year reagan pledged in 1983 over a fiveyear period to former 
president ferdinand marcos and 129 million above the 352 million 
the united states is providing this year to the aquino government 
manglapus said sunday that the pact also includes an agreement 
on nuclear weapons and us backing for a bond program aimed at 
reducing the philippines 28 billion debt 
clark air base and subic bay naval base are considered vital to 
regional and western security interests across a wide part of the 
world stretching from the pacific to the persian gulf 
the terms fall short of the 12 billion that philippine sources 
said manglapus originally wanted he said however that us and 
philippine officials were never far apart on actual cash 
compensation in talks that began april 5 in manila he said the 
disagreements were over us failure to approve benefits and 
concessions that would not require congressional approval 
apart from the us military and economic aid the agreement 
calls for us underwriting of the cost of philippine security 
measures up to 4 million a year if funds can be found 
the pact is expected to lead to talks next year on the longterm 
future of the bases which many filipinos want removed after the 
lease lapses in 1991 mrs aquino has not said whether she supports 
us use of the bases after 1991 any new treaty would have to be 
approved by a twothirds vote of the philippine senate and a 
possible referendum 
failure to conclude the bases review originally scheduled for 
july has delayed reagan administration endorsement of a 5 billion 
multilateral aid program proposed by two republican and two 
democratic members of congress white house sources have said the 
president backs the plan but it could not be set up until the 
amount of the base compensation was set 
the debt relief plan linked to the bases accord is complex it 
calls for the united states to put up us treasury bonds that 
would back a philippine bond issue that initially would be 
exchanged for outstanding debts at 50 cents on the dollar 
manglapus said 
philippine officials previously said they would ask that the 
united states put up 100 million in us treasury bonds to back a 
philippine bond issue 
manglapus said us officials agreed that the money would come 
from steppedup payments of delayed fiscal 1988 and 1989 aid that 
previously could not be used to pay off the debt

two former officers of a western pennsylvania 
firm pleaded guilty monday to providing false information on a 
defense contract that inflated the cost of a fighter planes radar 
by 18 million

automation inc of north huntingdon westmoreland county and h 
ray rambler 50 of greenville sc former vice president of

assistant us attorney peter v marcoline said the men

johnson said the actuator is a hydraulically operated component 
of the radar system located in the nose of the f15 each fighter 
has two actuators to move the radar horizontally and vertically he 
said 
in seeking payments from sept 1 1982 to oct 1 1986 the men 
had nuclear automations controller inflate the time needed to 
build each actuator from 70 to 93 hours resulting in an 
overpayment by the government to hughes according to marcoline

they averaged about 5100 each to manufacture

the head of the soviet un delegation 
amplified on monday his nations call for establishment of a un 
navy and an expanded role for peacekeepers 
deputy foreign minister vladimir petrovskys statement to a un 
committee echoed soviet proposals already put before the general 
assembly but emphasized soviet willingness to keep its innovations 
within the current un charter 
we regard as generally sound the existing order under which 
un peacekeeping operations are carried out said petrovsky 
however he reiterated a soviet proposal for possible 
stationing of un observers along frontiers within the territory 
of a country that seeks to protect itself from outside interference 
at the request of that country alone 
under present un practice peacekeepers are not deployed 
unless all countries in the area consent 
petrovskys proposal would be of interest to afghanistan a 
soviet ally which has lodged numerous complaints that islamic 
rebels are using pakistan as a base for staging crossborder raids 
into afghan territory 
more than 100000 soviet troops are withdrawing from afghanistan 
under the unmediated geneva accords 
last month however soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
said the next phase of the pullout depends on whether the soviets 
and afghans receive a satisfactory response to their complaints of 
pakistans alleged violations of the accords 
petrovsky also called for the use of un peacekeepers in 
troubled areas before conflict breaks out and posting observers 
along tense borders 
the soviet union stands ready to set aside units of its military 
forces for use in un peacekeeping he said suggesting that many 
nations also set aside troops who would serve as a reserve guard 
for un peacekeeping 
petrovsky offered the use of soviet transports and logistical 
support for the un plan for independence for southwest africa 
also known as namibia which is ruled by neighboring south africa 
noting his previous calls for a un naval task force for the 
persian gulf petrovsky expanded the concept by suggesting the 
formation of a un navy including minesweepers and escorts to 
protect commercial ships in dangerous international waters 
the united states britain france and other western democracies 
have blocked similar packages of soviet peacekeeping and 
international security proposals in the last two general assembly 
sessions 
diplomats for the western allies say many of the soviet 
proposals have merit but when combined into a comprehensive 
security proposal they amount to a restructuring of the un 
charter which the west opposes 
petrovskys references to innovations in accordance with the 
un charter appeared to be intended to allay such fears

a prosecutor said monday that charles 
ng wanted in california for allegedly carrying out a string of 
murders joined forces with a mass murderer in the early 1980s to 
kidnap targets for sex slayings 
as ngs extradition hearing got under way amid tight security 
federal crown prosecutor bruce mcfarlane told a packed courtroom he 
will argue that ng and his companion leonard lake were acting in 
concert to achieve the same overall objectives 
ng 27 has been serving a 4year sentence in canada since his 
conviction in december 1985 of armed robbery during a botched 
shoplifting attempt in calgary he came to canada after lake 
committed suicide 
lake later was linked to the deaths or disappearances of 22 
people that investigation led to the charges against ng 
mcfarlane told the court that ng whose name is pronounced ing 
and lake became acquainted in the early 1980s 
he said the two men moved to calaveras county about 120 miles 
east of san francisco and built a series of underground rooms 
referred to as the bunker 
there mcfarlane told the court ng and lake began to formalize 
a plan to kidnap people in the california area and take them to the 
bunker for what he called their own sexual gratification 
the extradition hearing scheduled to last 5 weeks is to 
determine whether there is sufficient evidence to send ng back to 
california where he faces 25 charges including at least 10 of 
murder 
canada has a policy of not extraditing criminals who could face 
the death penalty and is entitled to ask for leniency under the 
1986 canadaus extradition treaty the final decision regarding 
extradition rests with justice minister ray hnatyshyn 
during mondays court appearance ng a former marine sat in 
the prisoners box wearing a navy tshirt and showed no emotion 
he was shackled at the wrists and flanked by armed officers 
spectators entering the courtroom were searched with metal 
detectors 
sharon sellitto 40 of san francisco whose 39yearold 
brother paul cosner is one of a dozen people ng is accused of 
murdering said outside the courtroom monday she wanted to see ng 
face to face 
as far as im concerned i dont want to hate a 2by2 picture 
that appears in all the newspapers she said i wanted to see 
him in person and make it real 
ngs lawyer don macleod said that even if enough evidence is 
found to extradite ng he will press canadian authorities to demand 
a us guarantee his client wont be executed

lawyers for former president gen 
leopoldo galtieri asked a court monday to cancel his trial for 
alleged human rights abuses in a case that led to tensions between 
soldiers and the civilian government 
galtieri was due to appear in rosario federal court wednesday to 
answer charges stemming from the december 1976 shooting deaths of 
13 political prisoners 
eighteen other retired generals or admirals face similar charges 
in trials that are resuming after a lapse of more than a year 
officers still are reluctant to testify they have said the 
proceedings should be in military not civilian court if held at 
all 
there is a situation of understandable uneasiness defense 
minister horacio jaunarena was quoted as saying in an oct 11 
interview in the newspaper la nacion but there is not the 
remotest possibility of a change in the political order 
low pay also has contributed to grumbling in the barracks 
jaunarena said he said a general earns about 1053 a month and a 
conscript is paid about 5 a month the national minimum wage is 
about 87 a month he said 
military salaries have not kept up with inflation which has 
soared 440 percent during the past 12 months also the military 
share of the federal budget has shrunk by half since president raul 
alfonsin took office in december 1983 it now stands at about 2 
percent 
alfonsin replaced a military dictatorship that had ruled since 
president isabel peron was ousted by a coup in 1976 the human 
rights abuses occurred for the most part in the mid1970s during 
the militarys crackdown on leftists 
a government commission issued a report in 1985 that said almost 
9000 people were arrested by security forces and never seen again 
in december 1985 five of the nine military officers who served 
in ruling juntas between 1976 and 1983 including former presidents 
gen jorge videla and gen roberto viola were convicted by federal 
court for crimes including kidnapping torture and murder 
galtieri president from december 1981 through june 1982 was 
commander of the 2nd army corps in rosario on dec 13 1976 when 
the political prisoners were slain 
soldiers of the 2nd army corps said the 13 tried to escape while 
being transferred from one jail to another witnesses said they 
were deliberately killed 
galtieris attorneys initially asked the supreme court to cancel 
the trial because only the supreme council of the armed forces the 
militarys highest court was legally empowered to try galtieri 
the supreme court rejected that argument on oct 3 
on monday defense attorneys claimed galtieri was tried and 
acquitted of the massacre during the 1985 trial prosecutors 
rejected that claim the rosario federal court was expected to rule 
shortly whether trial would go ahead as scheduled 
rosario argentinas third largest city with 1 million 
residents lies 185 miles northwest of the capital buenos aires 
galtieri currently is serving a 12year sentence after he was 
convicted by the supreme council of the armed forces in may 1986 of 
mismanaging the 1982 war with britain over the falkland islands 
a civilian court is reviewing that decision prosecutor luis 
moreno ocampo has asked buenos aires federal court to increase the 
sentence to 18 years in prison 
relations between the civilian government and the military in 
power for most of the years between the 1955 coup that ousted 
president juan d peron and alfonsins election five years ago 
have always been sensitive 
in april 1987 three garrisons revolted after maj ernesto 
barreiro refused to appear in court and face trial for alleged 
human rights violations 
a month later congress passed the due obedience law that 
stated only generals could be charged with human rights abuses from 
that point on cases against hundreds of lowerranking officers 
were dropped because they allegedly were only following orders 
alfonsin who proposed the legislation said it was necessary to 
avert civil war

did address some important issues 
the actress only recently began talking publicly about the 
crime in a recent interview with the new york daily news she said 
she decided to speak out after attending a fundraiser at a los 
angeles rape treatment center i was overwhelmed by the strength 
of the women i met and thought that i had been a coward by not 
speaking out myself she said in the interview 
mcgillis was not the only person associated with the film who 
had an intimate knowledge of rape and its aftermath a former 
girlfriend of jonathan kaplan the movies director was gangraped 
for 12 hours in their apartment while kaplan was out of town he 
said 
rape has almost become a right of initiation at fraternity 
houses said sherry lansing who coproduced the accused with 
stanley jaffe 
thats appalling what i hope will happen is that no one 
will everlook at a rape victim the same way again lansing said 
no one will ever say she asked for it 
fosters character sarah tobias is a provocative and 
foulmouthed waitress who likes to have a good time but the film 
points out as courts and womens groups have over the past few 
years that the sarah tobiases are just as much a victim as women 
who are more demure and sheltered 
the incredible thing about the rape scene in the movie is that 
it isnt sexual foster said its about violating humanity 
and saying this isnt a person this is like a piece of something 
to serve my purposes 
hollywood has confronted rape before and fairly graphically in 
movies such as lipstick and extremities 
however the accused comes more directly from real life it 
is strongly reminiscent of a 1983 case in new bedford mass in 
which a woman was gangraped on a pool table at big dans bar as 
several patrons either whooped encouragement or failed to 
intervene the tavern was in a section of new bedford heavily 
populated by portugueseamericans 
six men all of portuguese descent were charged in the case 
four were convicted and two were acquitted paramount pictures 
responding to criticism from portugueseamerican groups who said 
the movie will open old wounds issued a disclaimer saying the 
accused was not based on the new bedford incident 
the movie in part focuses on the prosecution of the onlookers 
who are charged with criminal solicitation 
the movie came about because ive wanted to do a movie about 
the responsibility that you have as a bystander a witness and how 
sometimes youre just as culpable when you watch something as when 
you actually participate lansing said 
to challenge the myth that women who say no actually mean 
yes sarah tobias is brazen that she chooses on one evening 
at the mill to be sexually aggressive and let her guard down does 
not mean she wants men to do whatever they please 
for a minute in her life she said im not going to feel 
danger and she ends up paying the consequences for being herself 
and thats a really sad thing foster said 
if i want to show that a woman always has the right to say no 
no matter if shes drunk or stoned or sexy or whatever i have 
to paint a character who in the beginning i want to dismiss 
lansing said but by the time you see what happened i dont 
think anybody could walk out of that movie and think that girl 
deserved to be raped 
lansing said it would be wrong to consider this a message film 
if you want to send a message you go to western union she 
said first and foremost you have to do a piece of entertainment 
that people will enjoy and then you slip your message in the best 
film entertains you and then you walk out of the theater and start 
to talk 
said mcgillis i dont think a film can change a whole social 
pattern but i do hope that what this film will do is to inspire 
people to start asking questions thats the beginning of 
education

new york city the home of rap music and 
rappers rundmc kool moe dee and ll cool j is also home to more 
murders each year than any other place in the nation 1691 last 
year 
lawrence krisna parker aka rapper krsone learned a lot 
about both in 1987 parker voice of the group boogie down 
productions scored a successful debut album with criminal 
minded just months before his music partner was gunned down by 
two teenagers during a bronx street dispute 
it was the latest twist in the strange tale of parkers life a 
life in which hes lived in city subways city shelters and a city 
jail 
every little bit of negativity i was up against was grounds 
for me to stay positive parker said in an interview during the 
bands recent tour it kept me alive 
parker left his home in brooklyn at age 13 he moved into the 
boroughs lush prospect park sleeping outdoors in the summer and 
in the subways when the temperatures dropped 
he eventually entered the dangerous city shelter system at one 
point a drug bust landed him in the bronx house of detention for 
60 days 
it was like a choppedup situation from shelter to apartment 
to shelter to street said parker that whole period was from 
age 15 to 20 
while residing at the franklin avenue shelter in the south 
bronx he met counselor scott sterling better known as dj scott 
larock 
i was the youngest client he was the youngest social 
worker recalled parker it was like we were destined to hook 
up 
it wasnt john lennon meeting paul mccartney at the quarry 
school for boys in liverpool but it was enough to convince both 
they had a future in music they picked up several other residents 
from shelters and some other friends boogie down productions was 
born 
when criminal minded was released last year they scored a 
hit despite very little radio support it sold more than 300000 
copies 
larock and parker were heavily into preparing the followup when 
the dj was murdered on aug 26 1987 after intervening in a 
dispute over a woman in may two bronx teenagers were arrested 
and charged in the slaying 
although scotts violent death cast a pall over parker and 
company the rapper says he did not consider quitting 
never the thought never crossed my mind for a second he 
said this album was already done before scott passed away not 
done on tape done in our heads im just carrying out an agreement 
that me and scott made 
included on the second lp by all means necessary are two 
cuts which decry the citys problems with the drug crack and 
with crime stop the violence and illegal business the 
problem says parker is delivering the message without giving a 
lecture 
the approach is not to sound like their mother and father 
people dont want to hear that he said the approach is to 
sound like their brother or their homeboy 
the approach is also to sound fresh parker added 
personally i listen to the radio to know what not to sound 
like he said i could run the list down for days of who not to 
sound like you could say everybody in the music industry at this 
point except gil scott heron

japanese archaeologists say a 6thcentury stone 
coffin opened in a previously untouched tomb contains dozens of 
treasures showing a strong likelihood of korean cultural influence 
in japan 
a government research team lifted the twoton lid off the 
vermillioncolored coffin oct 8 at the fujinoki tumulus or mound 
in nara prefecture the heartland of ancient japan 
japanese newspapers and television have given the discovery 
extensive coverage while the archaeologists carefully drain water 
from the coffin to retrieve the encrusted articles 
they say the treasures include at least three swords a pair of 
giltbronze shoes a golden necklace earrings ornaments and other 
accessories the coffin also contains human bones and remnants of 
cloth 
officials at kashihara archaeological research institute of nara 
prefecture in western japan say recovery of the relics and 
remains will take several weeks the identity of the person buried 
in the tomb is not known 
professor kyoichi arimitsu of kyoto university who directed the 
kashihara institute in 19801984 said the relics were believed to 
be from one of koreas three ancient kingdoms silla paekche or 
koguryo 
they are similar to those found in tumuluses in the korean 
peninsula he said in a telephone interview after inspecting the 
excavation 
kazu uehara a professor of art history at seijo university in 
tokyo agrees with arimitsu 
when a set of harness was found at the fujinoki tumulus three 
years ago some people disagreed with my view that it might have 
come from korea he said they said the harness looked more 
like chinese 
the remains in the stone coffin i believe will correct their 
theory i know of course there are similarities between ancient 
chinese culture and that of korea however they are not the same 
for instance hexagonal ornaments extracted from the stone coffin 
have been found only in korean tumuluses 
there are some japanese scholars who would hesitate to accept 
the fact that japan received more cultural heritage from korea than 
china the tendency i believe stems from an attitude of 
looking down on a small country like korea 
the tomb and mound date from the yamato period which ran from 
early in the christian era through 710 
yamato is the ancient name for mountainous nara prefecture 
where the first unified state in japan was based members of its 
ruling class were buried in mounds 
japan and korea made their first peaceful contacts during the 
yamato period and japan began its long history of adopting and 
adapting the cultures of others 
writing in chinese characters was imported from paekche in korea 
in 285 in the next 300 years through contacts with korea the 
japanese learned of the formidable and advanced culture of the 
asian mainland 
arimitsu said the fujinoki mound was believed to have been 
created between 551 and 575 it is about 600 yards from the 
buddhist temple horyuji built between 601 and 607 in the town of 
ikaruga 8 miles southwest of nara 
excavation of the mound which is 30 feet high began in 1985 
about 3500 relics have been found including exquisite gold and 
bronze objects in addition to the stone coffin 
archaeologists viewed the coffins interior in june using a 
flexible instrument with a lens on the end and set up a 
chainandpulley mechanism to raise the heavy peaked cover

alumni but none more prominent today than a spook from the 
class of 1948 george herbert walker bush 
little is known about the strange rituals and practices of the 
156yearold society and thats the way its members want it the 
rites are rumored to include placing initiates in a coffin and 
requiring them to plunge naked into a pile of mud 
some of the rumors come from rival societies and may be 
suspect no one but members really know what goes on inside the 
windowless mausoleumstyle structure of brown sandstone to which 
bonesmen retreat 
but as the republican presidential nominees own experience has 
shown membership in the society forms powerful bonds of friendship 
that endure long after graduation 
the vice president was one of 15 yale juniors tapped for skull 
and bones in 1947 to this day the bonesmen who once heard him 
recount some of the innermost secrets of his life remain his good 
friends 
perhaps because of the pledge of secrecy that bonesmen take 
bush did not mention his skull and bones membership in his 
autobiography looking forward 
the society has long been suspected of ritualistic thefts a 
group of history buffs in el paso texas claimed that the skull 
referred to in the societys name belongs to mexican revolutionary 
pancho villa whose grave was robbed in 1926 
endicott davison a lawyer who says he speaks for skull and 
bones said the society does not have the skull 
the former chairman of the san carlos apache tribe in arizona 
charged recently that bushs father prescott bush stole the skull 
of apache chief geronimo years ago and that it is still on display 
at skull and bones inner sanctum that claim was denied by the 
vice presidents brother jonathan bush 
one thing is not disputed bush the bonesman is in powerful 
company 
brothers of the order have included henry stimson averell 
harriman henry luce potter stewart mcgeorge bundy archibald 
macleish william f buckley jr and william sloan coffin jr 
prescott bush a republican senator from connecticut was a 
member so was bushs oldest son george w bush and about a 
halfdozen other family members 
skull and bones is arguably the most famous and influential 
secret society in the united states having served as a model for 
others that followed at yale and other institutions 
it was founded by william russell a member of the yale class of 
1833 apparently in reaction to the stripping of secrecy from phi 
beta kappa the honorary scholastic society during the rise of a 
national antisecrecy movement 
skull and bones is a private organization incorporated as the 
russell trust association it pays taxes to the city of new haven 
and owns deer island a resort on the st lawrence river 
giving skull and bones the benefit of the doubt brooks mather 
kelly in a 1974 history of yale wrote of the society its 
purpose and programs were not revealed when it was founded and have 
never since been known but that like most yale societies it 
pretends to some intellectual and educational purpose can probably 
be assumed 
the society comes from a tradition of elitism of which yale 
was at the center said dan a oren author of joining the 
club a book published in 1985 about the relationship between the 
university and jews 
skull and bones became the first of the secret societies to 
admit a jew in 1937 during the 1960s the society tapped a number 
of outspoken radicals even today however it remains steadfastly 
allmale of yales seven secret undergraduate societies only one 
other wolfs head refuses to admit women 
having women as members would interfere with one of the ways 
bonesmen become true brothers by all accounts skull and bones 
initiates must lay bare their souls telling their sexual histories 
and life stories in graphic detail 
the danger of secret societies and entering into the club 
world is it allows members to lose sight of the common folk who 
arent part of the elite oren said but he said that bushs 
experiences in world war ii combat worked the other way 
for so many veterans their fight was against the racists and 
the bigoted values of nazi germany so when they came back they 
were embued with a strong sense of egalitarianism oren said 
bush 21 and already married entered yale in 1945 after his 
discharge from the navy which awarded him the distinguished flying 
cross and three air medals for his wartime exploits while on one 
combat mission bushs plane was shot down and he was rescued by a 
submarine two fellow crewmen perished 
bush recounted his brush with death for bonesmen in 1947 with 
great emotion says former rep thomas wl ashley dohio another 
member of the bones class of 1948 
what comes to mind was he was an awful young guy who had had 
an idyllic kind of childhood who suddenly found himself in an 
airplane that was on fire facing a lot of death around him and 
almost certain death himself ashley said 
ashley and other bonesmen in his yale class are still close 
friends of bush obviously we became fond of each other 
ashley said this was something kind of special to us 
he added george bush is exactly just as loyal to other 
friends as those who happened to be in the society with him his 
friendship across the social range is known to everyone 
members of the bones class of 1948 came to washington in 1981 
for a reunion that included dinner at the vice presidents mansion 
and a tour of the white house oval office 
his having been a member of skull and bones and his continued 
involvement as an alumnus means he would probably be likely to draw 
upon past connections for the white house oren said 
but his choice of people james baker iii to be campaign 
manager dan quayle as vice president shows hes willing to go 
beyond yale oren said 
he has always maintained close connections to skull and bones 
but his world certainly goes beyond new haven

ventriloquist paul winchell asks how do you 
spell tigger and slips into a voice fitting for a cartoon tiger 
tidouble grrrrer 
winchell during an interview frequently demonstrates the range 
of cartoon voices he does for disney and hanna barbera 
but there are faint echoes across the executive dining room atop 
the animation building at the disney studios you hear a quack 
quack here and a quack quack there other people at other 
tables are also doing cartoon voices 
for a moment you feel youve wandered into the ink and paint 
club in who framed roger rabbit 
for the last 20 years winchell has been the voice of tigger 
the zany tiger in the animated versions of aa milnes beloved 
winnie the pooh the first effort winnie the pooh and the 
blustery day won an academy award as best animated movie short 
in 1968 it has now become a saturday morning series on abc as 
the new adventures of winnie the pooh 
winchell in fact does voices for two other saturday morning 
shows disneys gummi bears and hanna barberas the smurfs 
hes also done voices for such movies as disneys aristocats 
and the fox and the hound 
until he began working on cartoons winchell was better known as 
a ventriloquist and the man behind dummies jerry mahoney and 
knucklehead smith his dummies are now at the smithsonian 
institution in washington 
at the age of 13 he was a winner on radios amateur hour for 
doing his imitation of edgar bergen and charlie mccarthy 
ventriloquist bergen was his childhood hero and winchell said one 
of the greatest thrills of his life was a joint appearance with 
bergen on the game show masquerade party 
we appeared as dr jekyll and mr hyde he said after we 
unmasked we picked up each others dummies i did charlie 
mccarthy and he did jerry mahoney it was a magic moment 
winchell made his television debut in 1947 and within a year was 
host of the bigelow show he was also host of a number of 
childrens shows including the paul winchelljerry mahoney 
show and circus time 
i first met walt disney 25 or 30 years ago he recalled 
he said were both in the same business i use cartoons and you 
use dummies and we both entertain children that was long before i 
started working here walt gave me a vip tour of the studio i 
remember people doing voices i said gee that must be fun and 
here i am 
ventriloquism today is in a slump children today havent been 
exposed to it edgar bergen was an enormous hit in radio but i 
think television defeats ventriloquism children are so used to 
seeing puppets that when they see a real ventriloquist they dont 
understand it on television everyone talks and they dont care 
about the mechanics 
winchell whitehaired at 66 suffered a heart attack two years 
ago my cardiologist said i could still do voices he said 
but to avoid working with the rest of the cast to avoid the 
stress the studios been very nice to me i can come in do my 
voices alone i was able to do some of them in a recording studio 
in miami when i was visiting there 
he said when he does a voice he likes to create an entire 
character many people do different voices but the basic rhythm 
is always the same he said i try to do more than just using a 
falsetto or pitching my voice i always look for little 
distinctions in each voice little characteristics or 
idiosyncrasies 
tigger for instance has a little lisp and a little laugh my 
wife is british and has a lot of sayings that i throw in shell 
say ttfn tata for now so tigger will say that and laugh it 
gives a character more dimension 
winchell is writing an autobiographical novel which he jokingly 
calls dummy dearest its actually called the strange saga of 
jimmy flood and will closely parallel his own career and life

millions of youthful ghosts and goblins will 
be taking to the streets in the annual ritual of trick or treat at 
the end of the month and that means adults need to take some 
special care to make it a safe celebration 
for children halloween is an occasion for merrymaking and the 
fun can result in carelessness on their part grownups need to be 
aware of this and be ready to compensate 
jackolanterns containing candles for example should be kept 
away from landings and doorsteps where long flowing costumes could 
come in contact with the flames warns the federal consumer product 
safety commission 
indoors make sure that these lanterns are away from curtains 
decorations and furnishings that could be ignited 
homes welcoming the visits of costumed youngsters should display 
a light and residents ought to pick up things like garden hoses 
and lawn ornaments that could trip children 
parents the safety commission says should tell their offspring 
to go only to homes where a welcoming light is on 
and they should be warned never to enter the home or apartment 
of a stranger setting a specific time for them to be home can be a 
good idea 
when shopping for costumes look for ones labeled flame 
resistant the commission says this doesnt mean the product wont 
burn but at least it will resist ignition and will extinguish 
easily if a fire starts 
flimsy skirts and costumes with big baggy sleeves should be 
avoided because of the danger of contact with fire 
make costumes short enough to avoid tripping and dress 
youngsters in shoes that fit moms high heels can be a hazard to 
youngsters the national safety council warns 
make costumes light and bright enough to be easily visible to 
motorists decorating or trimming the costume with reflective tape 
can be a big help 
these reflective tapes can be seen by drivers even when 
traveling at high speeds the american optometric association 
reports 
bags intended for goodies can also be decorated with reflective 
tape and children should also carry flashlights to help them see 
and be seen 
the commission urges using natural masks of cosmetics rather 
than buying the child a plastic or cardboard mask which can 
obstruct vision and even restrict breathing 
swords knives and similar costume accessories should be soft 
and flexible 
warn children not to eat any of the treats before they get home 
and then examine all the items carefully before allowing them to be 
eaten 
be especially wary of treats that are not wrapped in original 
wrappers in many areas local hospitals offer to xray halloween 
treats and some local police departments have programs too 
small children should be accompanied by an adult on their rounds 
and all youngsters should be warned against running out from 
between cars or across lawns where ornaments furniture or 
clotheslines may prove dangerous to them 
adult drivers need to be aware of the large numbers of children 
who will be out and need to watch for them in the streets or 
darting out unexpectedly be especially wary when pulling into 
driveways and alleys 
and finally bring in your pets on halloween night urges the 
humane society of the united states 
black cats seem to be particularly subject to cruelty on this 
evening and even dogs in their own yards arent safe from 
thoughtless or cruel people the society warns keep pets inside or 
on a secure leash if walking them 
dogs or cats frightened by the sight of costumed children may 
also bite or scratch the society warns and keeping the pet away 
from the holiday confusion can prevent these problems 
and remember pets are like children in one way letting them 
consume candy gum and cookies can lead to an upset stomach

sidney rittenberg came to china as a young 
idealist and his reward was 16 years in prison now he helps other 
foreigners find keys to the doors of commerce in his adopted land 
rittenberg 67 is president of kamsky and rittenberg a 
consulting firm that helps foreign clients most of their american 
get information and access to chinese officials 
since establishing the firm a year ago rittenberg has found 
markets and chinese partners for us makers of gas turbines 
pencils jeans and electrical appliances and guided them through 
the enigmatic world of chinese contract negotiations 
he has organized tours for such as evangelist billy graham and 
gov ray mabus of mississippi sometimes acting as interpreter in 
impeccable mandarin at meetings with senior chinese leaders 
i like the feeling that were building little bridges he 
said in an interview 
rittenberg began building his bridges decades ago with some 
disastrous consequences he is a native of charleston sc and 
first came to china in 1945 as a us army interpreter after 
studying chinese at stanford 
like other young american liberals caught up in the turbulence 
rittenberg was attracted by the zeal and idealism of mao tsetungs 
revolutionaries 
i was taken with the idea they were going to build a new kind 
of just democratic socialist society he said after leaving the 
army he decided to stay in china at the urging of chou enlai and 
other leaders to help establish an englishlanguage radio service 
when chinese authorities put him in the back of a truck going to 
beijing in 1949 he thought he was being enlisted to help negotiate 
relations between the united states and maos new communist 
government i was euphoric he said 
instead rittenberg was imprisoned on charges of being an 
american spy 
he learned later that soviet dictator josef stalin demanded his 
arrest claiming rittenberg was an accomplice of american 
journalist anna louise strong who had been arrested in moscow for 
spying she and rittenberg were collaborating on a biography of mao 
six years in prison followed the first of them in an unlighted 
room with black cloth over the windows 
when he was released and cleared of wrongdoing in 1955 mao 
apologized to me he said they really felt bad about it and 
took me into the family 
back at radio beijing he was made privy to material seldom 
revealed to outsiders that was power access to inside 
information he said in the interview 
his world collapsed once more during the cultural revolution of 
196676 
again he was deceived he said he thought the cultural 
revolution with which mao dislodged the entrenched bureaucracy 
was a great day a kind of town hall democracy 
but the radical leftists who gained power revived the old spying 
charges and jailed him in 1968 he spent 10 years in solitary and 
his chinese wife yulin was sentenced to three years in a labor 
camp 
there was only one real issue keeping your sanity from day to 
day he said of the lost decade i tried not to be bitter in 
solitary bitterness is the enemy but who are you going to be sore 
at it was the whole system 
he said he felt freedom was near when he heard maos widow 
jiang qing yelling from a nearby cell jiang who rittenberg says 
personally prolonged his prison term was arrested in late 1976 as 
ringleader of the notorious gang of four 
again released and again exonerated he was given a sinecure 
with the academy of social sciences helping arrange academic 
exchanges in 1979 he returned to the united states for the first 
time in 34 years 
rittenberg now spends about half the year in the united states 
his consulting firm has an office in new york and he has a home in 
seattle where one of his four children also lives 
his hope that chinese communism would be different from the 
russians more civilized and democratic dissolved long ago 
mao went back on his promises he said and if the 
democratic socialism he once envisioned for china ever comes it 
will be nothing resembling marxistleninist societies so far 
after so many years away rittenberg said he finds the united 
states to be a more humane country 
the leaders of the chinese revolution didnt understand that 
if not everyone is protected by law then no one is he said 
our forefathers were smart enough to build that into the system 
rittenberg worries about corruption in china where young people 
have no 10 commandments and no communist ideology and party 
officials are among the greediest he said there are thieves 
galore built into the system but believes a kind of 
selfcorrecting mechanism will see china through 
china and the united states have a special chemistry and 
theres no reason it shouldnt cement and grow rittenberg said 
i feel kind of good it is happening now

bolstered by a personal fortune worth 
millions ellen malcolm is on her way to becoming a force in the 
democratic party a powerbroker with the clout to make and break 
candidates 
forget the men in smokefilled rooms malcolm is a new breed of 
wheelerdealer driven by a conviction that society will be a 
better place if more women are elected to high office 
to that end malcolm four years ago created emilys list a 
political action committee that funnels money to select women 
candidates around the country 
malcolm has three criteria for her list candidates must be 
democrats support the equal rights amendment and endorse a 
prochoice stand on abortion 
when youre on emilys list that really means something 
said malcolm 41 a tall straighttalking woman with few pretenses 
and a relaxed manner 
usually what it means is enough money early on for a candidate 
to run a viable campaign through the general election 
emilys list was absolutely crucial to my campaign said 
sen barbara mikulski dmd one of the two women in the senate 
peggy connally spokeswoman for the democratic congressional 
campaign committee said it is a tremendous boost to be placed 
on the list they are willing to come out early and endorse most 
national groups are reluctant to make an early endorsement 
malcolm came up with the name emilys list to underscore her 
commitment to backing candidates early in a race the name emily 
stand for early money is like yeast it makes the dough rise 
in 1986 emilys list endorsed only two candidates mikulski and 
harriet woods who lost her bid for the missouri senate seat 
this year nine women all house candidates running in open 
seats or trying to oust incumbents have been recommended as 
beneficiaries of more than 500000 collected from list members 
emilys list differs from many political action committees in 
the way it distributes money pacs are restricted from giving more 
than 5000 in the primary and 5000 in the general to any 
candidate 
emilys list recommends women and then asks people to write 
checks to the candidate of choice emilys list processes the 
checks and distributes them 
the practice called bundling allows a candidate to collect 
unlimited funds from a number of invididuals each of whom can give 
no more than 1000 in the primary and the general election about 
2000 people contribute to candidates on emilys list 
a committed democrat malcolm worked in a variety of public 
interest jobs before she founded emilys list she was an organizer 
for common cause the public interest lobby and served as press 
secretary for the national womens political caucus 
malcolms wealth springs from her multimillion dollar 
inheritance from her greatgrandfather a founder of ibm she 
serves as a volunteer giving emilys list a maximum allowable 
contribution of 25000 annually 
a graduate of hollins college malcolm holds a degree in 
experimental psychology and a business degree from george 
washington university 
one political development that disconcerts malcolm is the 
failure of democratic women to move more quickly into high 
positions republican women many of them moderates have made 
faster gains in modern day politics 
the reason republican woman are moving up quickly is that the 
party helps recruit women providing them with needed financial 
support early in their careers she said 
ann stone a fundraiser for republican candidates thinks there 
are other reasons why more gop women get elected even though more 
women run as democrats 
polling data shows that democrats have a problem being seen as 
competent and republicans have a problem being seen as 
passionate she said that perception helps republican women 
because they are easily able to counter the notion they are 
unfeeling

centrists run the national 
administration and rightists dominate the legislature but the 
radical left has gained control of el salvadors leading university 
during nine years of civil war 
portraits of che guevara and farabundo marti the revolutionist 
for whom the marxistled guerrilla army is named gaze from campus 
walls at students moving between classes at the university of el 
salvador 
long live the people up in arms is written across the 
school of humanities facade leftist folk songs boom over the 
public address system 
conservative groups in el salvador a nation of 55 million 
paople about the size of massachusetts say the 35000member 
student body has become a fifth column of subversives 
some students teachers and alumni contend however that 
radical student unions do not represent the majority 
like nearly all national universities in latin america el 
salvadors is financed by the state but remains autonomous the 
government has virtually nothing to do with its administration 
police and soldiers are forbidden by law from entering the 
grounds but that did not prevent a militarydominated regime from 
invading the school in 1980 and shutting it down for four years 
when president jose napoleon duarte a christian democrat 
visited the campus last year to inspect damage done by a severe 
earthquake catcalls and shouted insults drowned out his attempts 
to speak 
if we examine the institutions that identify with the needs 
and aspirations of the salvadoran people we find they are all 
politicized because we are in the middle of a war said luis 
argueta antillon a leftist economist who is the universitys 
rector 
these institutions cannot withdraw themselves from that war 
no one can remain neutral he told an interviewer in his office 
a conservative alumni group alleged in paid announcements 
published last month that the standard bearers of terrorism had 
taken over the student body with the object of fomenting social 
disorder 
student unions use demonstrations for increased government 
spending on education as a pretext for acts of terrorism in the 
streets the ads said 
among about 3000 students in a march for more funds sept 13 
were 200 with bandannas over their faces carrying iron staves or 
nailstudded wooden clubs the military says some masked marchers 
are guerrilla urban commandos 
that march ended in a melee of tear gas and flailing clubs when 
300 riot troopers moved in on the demonstrators the driver of a 
police truck was killed allegedly shot by a marcher 
about 250 people were arrested and 14 charged with subversive 
affiliation all eventually were released for lack of evidence 
argueta said security forces frustrated at release by the courts 
of people they consider subversive might resort to kidnapping and 
murder to quell student action 
two young men carrying books entered a university cafeteria oct 
3 walked up to custodian raul escamilla drew pistols and shot him 
to death a university statement called the killing part of a 
government and military campaign against the university 
escamilla 34 was arrested by the national police and held for 
several days last year on suspicion of affiliation with the 
farabundo marti national liberation front 
eli ruiz a journalism professor worries about the effect of 
radical activism on academic standards 
the effort to keep classes from politicizing is constant 
ruiz said and he tries to teach according to scientific 
criteria but because of the context of conflict that is very 
difficult 
the rector arqueta contends we cannot think in terms of 
academic level for its own sake 
he said medical school graduates had enjoyed success in north 
america and europe a testament to their training but the fact 
we turned out good doctors did not lower our infant mortality rate 
or provide better conditions of public health or increase life 
expectancy 
argueta is presiding over a revision of the rules to require 
that future graduates contribute 500 hours of social service in 
their fields 
asked why no centrist or rightist student union had been formed 
he noted that 75 percent of students were from families of workers 
or peasants while the expressions of the center and the right are 
minority expressions 
realizing they are in the minority they dont want to get 
into an open confrontation of ideas he said of students from the 
political center and right 
one student speaking privately said conservatives on campus 
are intimidated by the radical minority 
when they come into a lecture hall and announce that class is 
suspended for a march or a sitin maybe three or four out of 80 
take part in the activity she said 
many conservative students express their opinions on lavatory 
walls a tour turned up condemnations of the guerrillas and leftist 
student unions generally unprintable and vivas for ronald 
reagan and roberto daubuisson 
daubuisson leads the rightist arena party which won control of 
the legislature this year and is said to have headed rightist 
death squads accused of killing thousands of alleged leftists in 
the early 1980s

but poisoning the earths atmosphere 
the world bank has estimated that since 1978 this type of land 
clearing has destroyed 240000 square miles of rain forest cover 
an area larger than california 
at this rate the amazon jungle could become an immense desert 
within 100 years says alberto setzer an environmental engineer 
with the brazilian governments space research institute 
further a report by the institute said the amount of smoke from 
the burnings is 1000 times more than that emitted by the 1982 
eruption of mexicos el chichon volcano which caused serious 
alterations in the chemical composition of the earths atmosphere 
critics charge that brazil has allowed haphazard and destructive 
settlement of the amazon basin which covers an area roughly 
twothirds the size of the continental united states and 
encompasses 30 percent of the worlds tropical rain forests 
saying he was alerted by the disclosure that scientists had 
found more than 6000 manmade fires in the amazon in a single day 
president jose sarney on oct 12 announced a new 
environmentalprotection program 
the program called our nature calls for a temporary end to 
government tax and financing benefits for largescale cattle 
ranching in the northern amazon and a ban on exports of unprocessed 
tropical timber 
we must create nationwide consciousness that we are all 
passengers in the adventure of man on earth sarney said in 
announcing the program the era of unlimited natural resources is 
over 
the our nature program also contains a recommendation to 
brazils congress to cut mercury imports freelance gold 
prospectors throughout the amazon use the highly toxic element to 
separate gold from river silt and then throw the waste into the 
water 
this program is going to shake up powerful economic 
interests said antonio jose guimaraes president of brazils 
federal forest service but the government is resolved to carry 
it out 
earlier laws designed to colonize and develop the poor amazon 
basin permitted land developers to burn off 50 percent of their 
properties the fastest and cheapest way to open up clear areas 
and then gave them tax deductions for doing so 
brazil already had some environmentalprotection laws in place 
but because of the countrys vast size deteriorating economic 
situation and scarcity of real enforcement power the laws were 
largely ignored 
scientists at the space research institute say that jungle fires 
last year released nearly 500 million tons of carbonic gases into 
the atmosphere making brazil one of the chief contributors to the 
greenhouse effect that is dangerously warming the earths 
climate 
scientific studies warn that rising global temperatures could 
eventually cause the inundation of major us and european coastal 
cities and the parching of prime heartland farm areas in north 
america europe and the soviet union 
in porto velho capital of the jungle state of rondonia in far 
western brazil compton tucker a physical scientist with the us 
space agency said the burnings in the amazon were responsible for 
10 percent of the carbon dioxide existing in the earths atmosphere 
today carbon dioxide is the major greenhouse gas he said 
the fires in brazil also are responsible for large quantities of 
carbon monoxide methane and nitrogen oxides scientists say 
tucker works for nasas goddard space flight center in 
greenbelt md and his main task is to trace emissions in the 
atmosphere from tropical forest burnings 
the state with the largest percentage of its amazon forest cover 
destroyed by fire is rondonia roughly the size of oregon which 
has become a mecca for hundreds of thousands of downandout 
peasant farmers and freelance gold prospectors along with some 
bigscale farmers and ranchers 
luiz alberto catanhede rondonia director of the brazilian 
forest service says than 26000 square miles of jungle or close 
to 28 percent of the states territory has been burned over the 
past 13 years 
during the maytooctober dry season the burning amazon casts a 
cloud of smoke over porto velho partially blocking out the sun 
drivers have to switch on their headlights during the day and the 
airport is frequently shut down because of lack of visibility

marcos da costa pereira a physicist with the space institute 
says the burning of the amazon is not only poisoning the 
atmosphere and affecting the earths ozone layer it is also 
reducing the rain forests capacity to produce oxygen 
he says that although it is an exaggeration to call the amazon 
the lungs of the world a phrase often found in press accounts 
the brazilian jungle is a major contributor of the oxygen 
breathed by mankind 
along br364 the 900mile asphalt highway that slices through 
the jungle to connect porto velho to cuiaba capital of the state 
of mato grosso the charred and still smoldering remains of once 
majestic brazil nut rubber and brazilwood trees stand in mute 
testimony to mans destructiveness 
along the highway homesteaders their faces blackened by trees 
turned to charcoal struggle to clear their land and plant crops 
such as rice corn and cassava before the rains come 
raimundo nonato de souza 50 owns 123 acres of land about 60 
miles outside porto velho he burned about 50 acres to plant 
cassava a tropical root that yields a coarse flour and serves as 
bread for impoverished peasants 
during a break from work he wipes perspiration from his brow 
with his forearm and says this is the second time i have burned 
this plot next year nothing will grow on it and i will have to 
burn some more of my land 
neither souza his 38yearold wife raimunda nor their two 
young children have any idea what the greenhouse effect is all 
about but expressing a kind of instinctive concern the brazilian 
says i know its wrong to burn the jungle but i have no other 
choice i have no money to buy a tractor which would let me clear 
the land without burning it 
souza like thousands of other homesteaders received his plot 
free of charge from the government but before i could receive 
title to my land i was told i had to clear it off and the best 
cheapest and fastest way to do so was to slash and burn 
another peasant farmer oscar fernandes 48 asks where am i 
supposed to grow the food to feed my family on top of the trees 
if i dont cut down the forest and burn it i will starve 
catanhede of the brazilian forest service says the worst 
offenders are the owners of large cattle ranches who burn more 
and more land each year to create pastureland to feed their growing 
herds 
after two or three burnings the land is completely depleted of 
all its nutrients nothing will grow on it the farmer then slashes 
and burns some more virgin forest to continue growing crops and 
the cattle raiser does the same to get more pastureland 
the forest service tries to control the burnings by issuing 
special licenses and setting limits on how much can be burned on a 
given property 
penalties for burning without a license are fines equivalent to 
725 dollars per acre affected and prison sentences of up to one 
year 
but the law is widely flouted debtridden brazil doesnt have 
enough forest rangers or policemen to make the rules stick and 
besides most of the jungle burners couldnt afford the fines 
anyway 
what we would really like is to be able to enforce the law 
that says a property owner must reforest the area he has 
destroyed catanhede says but with only 15 forest guards to 
keep an eye over more than 90000 rural properties in the entire 
state and with no funds to increase our manpower controlling the 
burnings becomes an impossible task 
francisco de assis araujo head of rondonias environmental 
protection agency says his office has been trying to educate 
farmers to plant perennial crops such as coffee cacao and rubber 
mango and orange trees 
the land would have to be slashed and burned only once to grow 
such crops and thus repeated burnings and further destruction would 
be avoided he says 
but homesteaders like souza and fernandes who have little or no 
education and who emigrated from other parts of brazil where their 
lives were even more wretched than in rondonia say they never 
received any instructions or guidance from the government 
araujo says the rondonia state government was about to implement 
an agroecological zoning plan to specify which areas were 
ecologically suitable for different agricultural activities and 
cattle raising thereby protecting theoretically the jungle from 
unnecessary destruction 
but he says brazils federal government facing political 
opposition because of a record 800 percent annual inflation rate 
views efforts to educate farmers about the proper use of the soil 
as superfluous expenditures which just increase the public 
deficit

editors note the magazine hit the newsstands at a time when 
movies such as platoon and good morning vietnam and tv 
series such as china beach and tour of duty were finding an 
eager audience but the success of vietnam magazine surprised even 
the publishers themselves all of a sudden there is almost a 
nostalgia for vietnam says the editor 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
as its circulation nears 250000 after only 
three issues vietnam magazine is receiving poems from boat people 
and letters from kids wanting to know more about the war dad at 
last is beginning to talk about 
i wouldnt be surprised if we started hearing from old viet 
cong cadre telling how they got ready for tet says harry 
summers a retired army colonel and twicewounded vietnam veteran 
who edits the magazine 
we never know where our readers are theres such renewed 
interest in vietnam everywhere weve had letters from korea and 
australia nippon tv just did a feature on us 
gregg oehler the 31year publisher of vietnam was in the 6th 
grade when the evening tv news showed the tet battle for the us 
embassy in saigon vietnam has fascinated him ever since but he 
had no idea that the quarterly he launched in march almost on a 
whim would attract such a readership by january it will become a 
bimonthly and expand from 68 to 84 pages 32 in full color 
the beer and tobacco advertisers are knocking on the door 
oehler says they dont usually bother with anything under a 
halfmillion circulation its incredible the first issue drew 
3000 letters we touched a sensitive public nerve that had been 
long suppressed and it exploded in my wildest dreams i never 
thought wed reach sales of 100000 in two years 
the magazine hit the newsstands at a time when movies such as 
platoon and good morning vietnam and tv series such as 
china beach and tour of duty were finding an eager audience 
all of a sudden there is almost a nostalgia for vietnam the 
vets are breaking out their faded jungle fatigues and boonie hats 
to march in veterans day parades we get letters recalling how 
beautiful the beaches were and asking about tours back to nam 
says summers our mail and reader surveys show that their wives 
widows and kids want to learn more about our leastunderstood war 
summers served as an infantry officer in war zone d and then 
returned to negotiate with the north vietnamese he was evacuated 
by helicopter from the roof of the us embassy when saigon fell 
our aim is to tell what happened not why as accurately and 
dispassionately as possible without glory or gore this is not 
rambo or soldier of fortune adds summers who has taught at 
the army war college authored several textbooks on military 
tactics and writes a syndicated column on military affairs 
the average age of vietnam veterans is now 41 and this baby 
boom generation is beginning to examine its youth 
executive editor c brian kelly credits the vietnam memorial 
with encouraging the 2594000 veterans who did a tour in vietnam 
to come out of hiding rejoin the mainstream and claim the pride 
that is their due the memorial has become both their wailing wall 
and the place to meet up with old buddies 
since its dedication on veterans day 1982 the memorial has 
become second only to the white house as a magnet for visitors to 
washington 
the gradual but growing visibility of vietnam veterans 15 years 
after the last american units stood down in southeast asia is 
reflected in the ranks of the american legion which now counts 
800000 of them in its 23 million membership 
this august for the first time several hundred vietnam 
veterans turned up in washington for the annual convention of the 
society of the first infantry division there are 77 vietnam 
veterans in congress

empire press which publishes vietnam magazine specializes in 
historical publications it publishes seven other magazines 
including world war ii american civil war age of napoleon and 
great battles from a quaint colonial building in the historic 
district of leesburg va 
kelly points out that a 12 to 15year lag in books and 
articles also occurred after the civil war which tore apart the 
country even more than vietnam did gen william t sherman 
published his memoirs in 1875 but it was 1881 before jefferson 
davis wrote his rise and fall of the confederate government and 
ulysses s grants memoirs didnt appear until 1884 
in telling the what rather than the why of the war early 
issues of vietnam gave graphic accounts of mig vs phantom 
dogfights over north vietnam the battle for song be in the mekong 
delta and b52 raids on the ho chi minh trail other articles 
looked back at the pentagon east the command complex at 
saigons tan son nhut airbase the huge americanbuilt port at cam 
ranh bay now crowded with soviet warships and french historian 
bernard fall who was killed in a mine explosion along route 1 his 
la rue sans joie street without joy 
this war was fought on so many different levels from lonely 
jungle outposts and huge bomber bases to tunnel rats and gunboat 
crews on the mekong that there is real hunger among our readers to 
find out what the other guys were doing there and how it all fitted 
together oehler says also we know from the mail there is a 
lot of interest in the 7500 women who served in vietnam and their 
effect on the expanding role of the female in modern warfare 
advertisements at the back of the magazine show a growing market 
for vietnam videotapes insignia authentic fatigues infrared 
goggles and military watches and a lively competition among 
collectors of battlefield souvenirs such as viet cong bamboo 
canteens and helmets authentic calico noir or black pajamas 
even pungi stakes clay grenades and other guerrilla weaponry 
upcoming issues include a look at how australian forces operated 
on jungle patrols an interview with neil sheehan about his 
biography of vietnam guru john paul vann and a stepbystep 
recounting of how army surgeons operating behind a wall of sandbags 
removed a live grenade from a gis back 
we have no shortage of manuscripts summers says and 
almost every week somebody offers us 1000 or so pictures he took 
out there were always willing to have a look but we stay away 
from the grisly stuff 
despite the continuing avalanche of both vietnam does not print 
poems or letters to the editor but we may review our policy 
there the editor says a lot of poignant poetry comes from 
vietnamese refugees 
try as it might to avoid controversy the magazine wandered into 
a politcal mine field while congress was considering a bill to move 
the starting date of the undeclared vietnam war back to feb 28 
1961 so more veterans could receive education and pension 
benefits eligibility now dates from aug 5 1964 when president 
lyndon johnson told congress us destroyers had been attacked in 
the gulf of tonkin 
the vietnam memorial commences its long gray granite line of the 
dead in 1959 vietnam magazine in its second issue moved the date 
of americas first vietnam casualty all the way back to sept 
26 1945 with an account of the assassination by communist 
bullets of oss maj a peter dewey who was on a mission to 
locate 214 americans at two japanese pow camps in the saigon area 
controversies of this sort oehler says show how much mystery 
and confusion still shroud the vietnam war if we can shed any 
valid historic light on any area of this enigma that still baffles 
the national conscience the magazine will be worthy of the 
interest it has generated among a generation that has been so sadly 
ignored

editors note it was less than a decade ago that a federal 
judge in michigan ruled that women in prison were not being 
afforded education employment and legal services equivalent to 
those for men since then many prisons have instituted reforms but 
not without prodding heres what happened at a womens prison in 
pennsylvania 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
women convicted of even minor felonies often 
enjoy fewer privileges behind bars than men serving time for murder 
or rape prison reform advocates say 
women prisoners concerns do not get the priority mens do 
says ed koren staff attorney for the american civil liberties 
unions national prison project if theyre thought about at all 
theyre way down the list they dont complain about it so 
correctional people are not really required to do anything about 
it 
the numbers may be one reason only about 5 percent of the state 
and federal prisoners nationwide are women 
but buoyed by some court rulings in recent years female 
prisoners are beginning to see some changes 
in 1983 for example women at the state correctional 
institution at muncy wanted a law clinic a privilege established 
long ago in mens prisons officials denied the request leading 
sharon wiggins and four other inmates to file a classaction 
lawsuit in us district court 
the suit also alleged that vocational educational medical 
rehabilitation and psychological services at muncy were inferior to 
those at prisons for men they also claimed exposure to fire 
hazards and asbestos endangered their safety 
we decided that maybe it was time to take a look at not only 
the legal situation but a lot of other things that we were 
concerned about education the medical department the way we 
were placed in jobs says miss wiggins who is serving a life 
term for killing a man during a bank robbery 
prison reform advocates say the claims are similar to those 
involving womens prisons in many states 
in the landmark glover vs johnson case in michigan us 
district judge john feikens in 1979 ruled that education 
employment and legal services for women prisoners were inferior to 
those for men he later ordered a series of improvements in those 
programs and the creation of a trust fund to benefit female 
prisoners 
the federal general accounting office in 1980 warned that such 
suits would increase as long as female offenders did not have 
facilities training or services equivalent to those for male 
offenders 
reform advocates say advances have been made as the number of 
women in state and federal prisons has doubled during the 1980s 
the number increase will ironically increase the numbers of 
programs says martha stone legal director of the connecticut 
civil liberties union 
charlene snow an attorney for the plaintiffs in the glover vs 
johnson case said my sense is that the glover decisions have 
enabled complainants in other states to use the language of the 
judge and the decisions to bring suits and get things settled 
at muncy miss wiggins said the inmates felt rejection of the 
law clinic was the last straw 
i decided that it was just time for me to either stand up and 
be heard or stop complaining and never doing anything about it 
she said 
the lawsuit has not come to trial but attorneys for both sides 
say many of the inmates complaints have been resolved they now 
have access to a legal program a drug and alcohol treatment 
counselor a mental health clinic and strengthened vocational and 
eductional programs 
unquestionably a number of the changes that were made are a 
direct result of this litigation said susan cary nicholas 
managing attorney of the philadelphiabased womens law project 
which is cocounsel for the plaintiffs along with thomas place a 
professor at the dickinson school of law 
muncy nestled in the lush farmland of the susquehanna valley 
today is a prison of stone cottages where inmates can grow 
vegetables and play softball with teams from nearby towns they 
also can qualify as paralegals and learn house painting 
upholstery computers and auto mechanics 
muncy administrators speak of a window of opportunity to change 
the lives of inmates most of whom are mothers and will leave 
prison after less than five years 
they need to be able to leave prison with something in their 
bag of tricks besides themselves says superintendent ann m 
goolsby 
the path often starts with basic education and inmates who need 
it can receive oneonone tutoring from the staff outside 
volunteers and other inmates 
the prison was established in 1920 as the state industrial home 
at muncy it was pennsylvanias only state prison for women until 
july 1 1984 when a minimumsecurity womens prison opened at 
waynesburg eleven housing units and 10 other buildings are 
clustered on muncys 62acre campus

mrs goolsby estimates that 70 percent of the 525 inmates were 
imprisoned for drugrelated crimes they range in age from 18 to 
69 with most between 25 and 39 eighty are lifers six are men 
the history of muncy is very typical of womens prisons ms 
nicholas says it was built at a time when it was fashionable to 
believe that the appropriate treatment of women offenders and 
juvenile offenders was to send them far out into the countryside to 
obtain fresh air and good healthy work and to remove them from the 
corrupting influences of the city 
muncys setting in rural lycoming county is within a short drive 
of the federal correctional institution at lewisburg and the 
allenwood federal prison camp but its a four to fivehour drive 
from philadelphia and pittsburgh where most of muncys inmates 
come from 
the distance became a sexdiscrimination issue in the lawsuit 
because many mens prisons are closer to major cities where 
families can visit more easily 
you cannot travel to muncy by public transportation for 
visiting hours ms nicholas says this is absolutely 
devastating to women who need to maintain contact with their kids 
a 4000 contract with the salvation army to provide 
transportation for children and caregivers is awaiting prison 
approval says steve jacobsen president of project impact inside 
muncyparents and children together a new program that provides a 
homelike setting for inmates to meet with children inside the 
prison 
apprenticeships following the example set in federal prisons 
were started at muncy in 1979 inmates can qualify for a license in 
upholstery caning and refinishing furniture auto mechanics food 
services and building construction and maintenance 
elsie denison who promoted prison apprenticeships before 
retiring from the womens bureau of the us labor department says 
muncy had an exemplary program that not only offered good training 
but helped inmates find jobs or further training once they left 
prison 
two jobplacement specialists travel around the state looking 
for jobs that would be suitable for inmates completing their terms 
and helping them make the adjustment 
the prison this fall will open a power sewing factory which will 
be part of the prison systems correctional industries allowing 
inmates to earn a bonus while learning skills that could help them 
find jobs outside prison 
the suits complaint that women with psychiatric problems 
received inadequate treatment has been resolved with the temporary 
conversion of one cottage into statecertified mental health 
clinic an 840000 mental health addition to the prison infirmary 
is awaiting an architect 
the lawsuits complaints about fire safety and asbestos have met 
with divergent fates 
prisoners at muncy are housed in buildings with antiquated 
celllock systems requiring that each of 40 to 45 cells be 
unlocked by hand by the guard on duty in the event of fire or other 
emergency the suit stated 
a 189 million project to install an electronic locking system 
fire detectors emergency exits and lighting was completed sept 
25 1986 says kenneth g robinson press secretary for the 
department of corrections the project was part of a systemwide 
improvement in the prisons life safety code he said 
still unresolved is the presence of asbestos a mineral fiber 
once widely used in building products but now associated with 
certain types of cancer 
two inspectors hired by the plaintiffs in october 1987 found 
asbestoscontaining materials throughout the institution jerry 
roseman and lynne lamstein of occupational health consultation 
services inc in bethlehem said in their report that prison 
maintenance workers had tried to remove and repair the materials 
without proper training 
on march 8 nearly three months after the inspectors report was 
sent to state attorneys two inmates and two staff maintenance 
workers were asked to work above and around crumbling asbestos from 
pipes according to a court motion filed in april 
robinson says the department now has contracted with lancaster 
laboratories of lancaster to review the extent of the asbestos 
problem 
miss wiggins interviewed in the formal conference room of the 
prison administration building said the suit has not endeared her 
to all inmates 
there are those inmates who feel and maybe rightly so that 
we shouldnt make such a fuss she says

editors note hes called the grand old man of 
birdwatching a james audubon of the 20th century its been more 
than 50 years since roger tory peterson published his guidebook for 
birdwatchers but its still considered the bible of birding and 
at age 80 hes still going strong promoting environmental causes 
at every opportunity 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
roger tory peterson artist and bird 
lover started a revolution 60 years ago in the hilly meadows 
and woods surrounding this small city in upstate new york 
a walk in the woods hasnt been the same since 
it was here that peterson found the inspiration for an epic 
work a field guide to the birds a book that revolutionized 
nature study it took ornithology out of the laboratory and made 
the feathered fanciful world of the treetops more accessible to 
the common man 
petersons guidebook is found in more than three million homes 
and libraries and is considered one of the main reasons 60 million 
americans take an interest in birds 
more important to peterson it has increased peoples awareness 
of the environment which he says was his underlying goal 
birding afterformance during curtain calls 
the entire cast showered crawford with red roses they were 
assisted by members of the audience some of them running down the 
aisles of the majestic theater to toss flowers on the stage 
an emotional crawford spoke to the theatergoers choking on what 
he said was the same thing he told his mother on his 21st birthday 
id like to thank you for having me he told the cheering 
crowd 
youre perfection yelled one enthusiastic woman 
but crawford has not hung up his phantom mask and put away 
his makeup for good the actor plans to do at least a ninemonth 
engagement beginning next may in the los angeles company of 
phantom its the best possible audition for the movies 
the film people are there and theyd see it he says i 
have got very strong interest and offers from two studios if im 
in los angeles i can work on development as it is happening 
crawford has made movies before film buffs know him from the 
knack a funny thing happened on the way to the forum 
hello dolly and how i won the war but this is the first 
time a movie will be planned around him what a difference a hit 
musical can make to a career 
i dont think i was known over here at all crawford says 
in england he was a star he appeared in several hit british 
television series and had done three big musicals in londons west 
end billy flowers for algernon and barnum the last 
show an american musical had an even longer run in england than 
it did in the united states 
it ran so long we had births and deaths in the audience 
crawford says people died and we had a woman give birth once 
it was like life aboard a 747 on an aroundtheworld trip 
phantom with the help of exposure on national television 
shows such as west 57th street has made his face familiar to 
fans in the united states 
when i first opened in phantom in new york even the stage 
managers would ask are you michael crawford he says before 
he left the show there were crowds of 50 to 60 people waiting each 
night at the stage door to see him 
and the letters never stopped coming every day he would receive 
more than 100 letters some from overseas and addressed simply 
michael crawford broadway usa 
crawfords most dedicated followers have been an informal group 
of britishers called the ogres which stands for opera ghosts 
return enthusiasts many of them came to new york for his final 
broadway appearance some had been here twice before unfurling 
banners down the majestic alleyway that proclaimed bring him 
home 
there are about 25 of them and they wont let anyone else 
join he says they are very exclusive and if anyone 
misbehaves they are out or if they bother me they dont like to 
annoy me they are very good to me 
crawford also has widened his appeal with his first solo 
recording songs from the stage and screen that he made before 
he opened phantom in new york 
they have sold over 200000 copies on the east coast so its 
on its way to gold he says and im very pleased there was a 
terrific amount of care gone into that record 
the album which includes a medley of songs from west side 
story and such broadway classics as if i loved you 
memory and youll never walk alone has sold well all over 
the world 
its triple platinum in new zealand which means it has sold 
20000 copies crawford says even the sheep are buying it 
crawford will go back into the recording studio early next year 
in london to record a second album this time a collection of love 
songs he hopes to include music of the night his big number 
from phantom if composer andrew lloyd webber grants his 
permission 
the performer also is considering several new broadway musicals 
although none he can talk about but its nice that ive been 
asked he says and one of them is of particular interest to 
me 
after phantom closed crawford flew to australia to make a 
documentary film for a british charity then he may begin to relax 
for a few weeks 
crawford admits hell miss the hoopla that accompanied his 
10month phantom run in new york although there are tradeoffs 
ill be glad to have it quiet after all that attention he 
says you need that quiet whenever you have finished a show that 
is an event

mart niklus was awestruck when speakers 
at a conference blessed by the kremlin made the same statements 
that had landed him in prison but he said the new freedom had not 
penetrated soviet labor camps 
niklus a dissident for decades who was freed july 8 heard two 
days of speeches as a guest delegate to an officially sanctioned 
meeting of the peoples front an estonian nationalist group 
a lot has changed he said people have become less afraid 
of publicity they criticize the authorities boldly 
people are more frank openhearted national 
selfconsciousness has become very strong its surprising for me 
niklus agreed that fewer people are going to jail for political 
reasons but also said the reform program president mikhail s 
gorbachev calls perestroika had not eased the misery of those 
already there 
there have been no changes perestroika hasnt reached the 
correctional labor camps he said 
for niklus the memories of arrests and prison are too vivid to 
permit complete belief in gorbachevs reforms he still holds his 
hand over his mouth when speaking of politically sensitive matters 
as a reminder to all the 54yearold former inmate wore the 
blackandgray striped uniform of special regime prisoners like 
himself who are repeat offenders or considered especially dangerous 
speakers at the conference oct 12 in tallinns city hall urged 
moscow to renounce josef stalins pact with the nazis under which 
the soviet union took control of independent estonia latvia and 
lithuania in 1940 
i was sentenced for that i got 10 years for that 
niklus said in the excellent english he learned while studying 
ornithology before he was sent to prison 
he and 47 other activists signed an appeal on the 40th 
anniversary of the agreement aug 23 1979 demanding its 
renunciation he was arrested in april 1980 on charges of 
antisoviet propaganda and agitation and sentenced to 10 years 
in prison and five in internal exile 
it was niklus fourth arrest he spent eight years in jail in 
the 1960s 
now even the estonian communist party is calling for a review of 
stalins foreign and domestic policies 
the party also has taken up some of nationalist demands making 
estonian the official language gaining local control over the 
republics economy and curbing immigration of nonestonians 
as a special regime prisoner niklus spent most of his time 
in solitary he was hospitalized for a month after his release 
being treated for chronic back pain that developed because he was 
forced to sit for long periods and poor eyesight he said resulted 
from confinement in a small dark cell 
to illustrate the decline of his health niklus displayed two 
photographs one taken in 1976 before his latest imprisonment in 
which he had a full head of black hair and full cheeks the other 
taken after his release in july showing a man with gray thin hair 
and sunken cheeks 
you are not treated as a human in special regime he said 
niklus described the standard diet was thin gruel bread and 
weak tea with sugar for breakfast cabbage soup bread and oatmeal 
for lunch except for sunday when the main course was macaroni and 
hot water and a small piece of fish in the evening 
those meager rations may improve however on july 25 the 
soviet parliament directed that rations for prisoners in solitary 
confinement or special regime no longer be reduced 
western estimates put the number of soviet labor camps at more 
than 1000 and say they hold at least 1 million people perhaps 
twice that 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights group says 
about 200 people now are in labor camps psychiatric hospitals or 
internal exile because of political beliefs compared with 10000 a 
few years ago 
soviet officials say all but a few people classified in the west 
as political prisoners were freed by amnesties in february and june 
1987 they say the antisoviet propanganda and agitation law 
under which they and niklus were convicted is being softened in a 
revision of the criminal code 
perhaps but niklus said they may arrest me again now i have 
been arrested four times you never know when they will get you 
again 
then he added with a slight chuckle but i am not afraid i 
have a kind of immunity

a colossal tunneling machine 
is boring beneath the english channel from the white cliffs of 
dover pursuing a dream born in napoleons time that is coming true 
at last 
another is digging from the french coast in what the tunnel 
builders call the largest civil engineering project now under way 
in the world 
the 31mile tunnel 24 miles of it underwater will cut the 
londonparis journey from six hours to three as fast as a 
scheduled airline 
it will enable freight to travel on one train instead of being 
shifted to trucks for a crosschannel ferry trip subject to weather 
and shipping strikes 
tunneling speed at the dover end is less than 15 feet an hour 
and the machine boring from the geologically more complex french 
end moves even slower which is why the tunnel will not open until 
1993 
for continental europeans accustomed to longdistance rail 
travel the tunnel is but a small spur on a vast network stretching 
to moscow and beyond 
for the british the change wrought by what many call the 
chunnel will be enormous some wonder whether britain will be 
ready for it 
people still question whether the tunnel will be complete in 
may 1993 and thats ridiculous says kathy watson coauthor of a 
book on the project theyre still arguing about whether it will 
introduce rabies into this country or let in terrorists 
they discuss it in terms of their being an island race with a 
channel that has kept out invaders she said in an interview 
stateowned british rail will not commit itself to building a 
highspeed link from london to the tunnel in time to make the 
threehour journey a reality in 1993 it intends instead to improve 
existing tracks 
eurotunnel the anglofrench consortium that will own the 
tunnel is urging british rail to speed its plans critics say the 
tangle of commuter lines in southeast england so obsolete that 
trains can be delayed by a sudden fall of autumn leaves will delay 
tunnel traffic 
the consortium forecasts 165 million passengers in 1993 but the 
railroad says that figure will not be reached before 1998 
arriving channel trains will terminate at waterloo station in 
south london at a large customs and immigration terminal critics 
say this will waste time and britain should follow the continental 
practice of handling such matters on the train during the journey 
british stations bridges and tunnels are not built for the tall 
loads commonly carried across the channel that means many loads 
will have to be repacked or transferred to trucks unless the 
facilities are rebuilt 
the grandiose project has been on and off the drawing boards for 
more than 200 years 
napoleon wanted to bore a tunnel in 1802 but britains generals 
warned him off digging began in 1882 but was halted by british 
fears of french invasion through the tunnel 
britains entry into the european economic community engendered 
a spirit of unity and the digging began again in 1974 but two 
years later a new british government shelved the project 
with trade barriers among the 12 eec countries set to fall in 
1992 colin kirkland technical director of eurotunnels on the 
british side says the tunnel will be completed this time 
he says the entire cost of 52 billion pound 88 billion 
project is privately financed and cancellation would cost the 
governments enormous penalties to shareholders 
also the governments signed a tunnel treaty in february 1986 
and both would have to agree to cancellation 
theres no way that politicians will cancel this project 
kirkland said in an interview its quite difficult to get one 
government to agree to get two is bloody nigh impossible 
moneys power to move the tunnel forward was demonstrated in 
august when drilling fell behind schedule 
eurotunnel ordered a management shakeup and threatened 
transmanche link the consortium of 10 british and french 
engineering companies building the tunnel with penalties of 25 
million if the diggers did not pass the threemile mark by nov 1 
from a a rate of 380 feet a week the pace quickly accelerated 
and recently achieved a weeks record of 480 feet kirkland said 
the timetable calls for 650 feet a week and kirkland is confident 
of reaching it 
the tunnel 80130 feet below the seabed was 2 miles into the 
channel from this end oct 9 the most recent measurement 
available and the french had progressed about 1300 feet digging 
began last december 
at its peak the project will employ about 11000 workers and 11 
tunneling machines 
construction of the two oneway train tunnels begins in 
december a smaller service tunnel running between them now is 
being dug 
tunneling machines simultaneously dig remove rock and put up 
tunnel walls with a laser beam to keep the driver on course the 
700footlong behemoth creeps along pressing curved slabs of 
scottish granite and pulverized ash into the newly exposed tunnel 
wall 
in an emergency like flooding the cylindrical head of the 
machine can expand to become a cork blocking off the water and 
spraying concrete into the cavity to seal the leak once the 
allclear is given the twostoryhigh rotating blade with its 
tungsten teeth resumes chewing ahead 
because the machines are too large to be removed when the 
digging is complete they will be rolled aside and walled in 
the tunnels are to be completed in 1991 then the railroad 
tracks will be laid eurotunnel will run shuttle trains once every 
three minutes at peak times between terminals near folkestone and 
calais and british rail and the frenh state railroad will operate 
trains from london and paris 
cars and trucks will drive onto the shuttle trains and be able 
to stay in their vehicles or stroll about during the 35minute 
tunnel passage

claras heart 
 
clara mayfield is a brutally direct woman who colors her human 
relationships with a good deal of common sense selfrighteousness 
and tenacity she also has an overwhelming humanity about her and 
that specialness attracts people to her like a magnet 
the relationship she forges with young david hart is bound to be 
a memorable screen joining 
clara is a vibrant and rich role one that could easily turn 
around whoopi goldbergs dismal film career after such losers as 
burglarjumpin jack flash and fatal beauty in which 
the standup comic was required to do little more than imitate 
eddie murphy and be the butterfly mcqueen of the 1980s goldberg 
finally has a chance to demonstrate her talents as a dramatic 
actress 
robert mulligan to kill a mockingbirdinside daisy 
clover restrains goldberg in his direction of this family 
melodrama allowing none of the bits and business that have become 
the trademarks of her wealth of comic stage characters that 
restraint is essential to clara herself a jamaican with a dark 
secret 
clara enters the lives of the affluent hart family from 
marylands eastern shore shortly after the crib death of their 
daughter leona kathleen quinlan and bill michaelontkean have 
gone to jamaica to help get over the tragedy clara is their hotel 
maid 
she coaxes leona out of her depression and encourages her to get 
on with life leona decides to bring her back to maryland she 
cant quite function without claras island sensibilities but son 
david hart takes an immediate dislike to clara and accuses his 
parents rightfully so of bringing her home so they wont have 
to deal with him 
the harts are in the process of a divorce he has taken up with 
a hot cutie and she has taken up with a pretentious bore of a pop 
shrink spalding gray 
clara eventually wins over david to the point where hed rather 
spend his weekends in baltimore with clara and her west indian 
friends than with his parents he also picks up claras island 
patois to the delight of her friends 
but davids dependency on clara ultimately leads to her dark 
revelation and it is here that the movie falters there is no 
buildup to this awful experience in her life and its unfolding is 
an abrupt twist and with the tale there remain loose ends 
letters hidden in a suitcase and found by david are never 
explained the father of claras child also is a mystery 
still claras heart is a warm movie with many lessons to 
tell if one is willing to listen its force is aided by goldbergs 
performance and a noteworthy movie debut of neil patrick harris as 
david 
the warner bros release of an mtm entertainment production 
features a lilting score by dave grusin but hollywood has yet to 
learn through its endless quest for authenticity that steel music 
and calypso are products of trinidad not jamaica where reggae and 
soca bloom

imagine john lennon 
 
rarely has a 20thcentury phenomenon been so thoroughly 
chronicled in every conceivable way as the beatles 
yet the new documentary imagine john lennon provides 
previously unseen material on the most enigmatic of the beatles if 
not any fresh insights 
yoko ono lennons everprotective widow released 200 hours of 
tapes and films from their private collection to documentary and 
miniseries producer david l wolper the making of the president 
1960roots wolper and producerdirector andrew solt culled 
through the material and also searched for newsreels and tv 
appearances 
the documentary material was combined with new interviews with 
yoko ono and lennons first wife cynthia sons julian and sean 
and various associates of lennon none of the three surviving 
beatles was interviewed 
imagine provides a gold mine for beatle lovers and 
especially those who revere lennon who was slain outside his 
apartment in manhattan by a crazed fan in 1980 
but the film provides marginal entertainment for the average 
moviegoer documentaries are never easy to endure in a theater 
imagine is no exception despite the great skill that went into 
its making 
there are some riveting moments the most scarifying comes when 
john and yoko encounter cartoonist al capp lil abner during 
the montreal bedin for peace a meeting as deadly in its way as a 
mongooses minuet with two cobras 
the lennons penchant for shock is demonstrated in a nude 
lovemaking scene which was filmed two weeks before he died 
intended for a music video it is antiseptically graphic hardly 
erotic at all 
director solt has capably maintained the kind of pace 
established in the trendsetting beatles feature a hard days 
night only in the final sequence does the film falter lennons 
murder and the outpouring of grief from his candleholding fans is 
protracted into a kind of deification that hardly suits the subject 
there is commentary by family and friends and lennons own 
voice narrates much of imagine whether he was excessively 
narcissistic or merely had a exceptional sense of history 
posterity should be grateful for his extensive recordkeeping how 
valuable it would be to have such records of james dean marilyn 
monroe elvis presley and other icons 
the warner bros release was coproduced by sam egan and written

talk is cheap island keith richards 
 
if mick jaggers solo records are jagger without the rolling 
stones conversely and somewhat symmetrically keith richards 
first solo effort is the stones without jagger 
richards isnt much of a singer but he manages a listenable 
rasp on a series of tunes that wouldnt exactly tax caruso this is 
a tough rock musicians record anyway starting with richards 
patented takenoprisoners guitar backed by a stellar cast of 
studio musicians including bernie worrell on organ waddy wachtel 
and mick taylor former stone on guitars bobby keys and macco 
parker on various saxes plus the memphis horns 
charley drayton is on bass most of the time steve jordan drums 
and ivan neville keyboards sarah dash sings background patti 
scialfa e street band and the boss main squeeze is on one cut 
all the songs were cowritten by richards and jordan 
take it hard and struggle are especially worth blasting 
loud enough to enrage the neighbors 
richards makes a mistake on make no mistake with his 
impersonation of peggy lee on steroids dash comes in to save it 
though giving richards a tom waitslike charm by comparison they 
team again on the wonderfully soulful rockawhile 
locked away is a real pretty tune richards should hire 
someone else to sing it by the last cut it means a lot it 
seems richardsjordan had run out of ideas 
but the closer of side 1 you dont move me is another 
fourstar effort that could apply to anyone you know who needs a 
verbal thrashing but here it was obviously meant for jagger you 
lost the feeling got so appealing why do you think you think you 
got no friends you drove em all round the bend ah yeah you 
dont move me anymore its no longer funny its bigger than 
money you just dont move me anymore 
as the record says talk is cheap so you better be able to 
move em yourself and most of the time richards does with room to 
spare

tighten up vol 88 columbia big audio dynamite 
 
mick jones once the fiery guitarist of punk heroes the clash 
now seems a little like a roguish older brother 
he lectures a lot mostly about respecting the rights of others 
his music once loud and brash is more melodic and dare we say 
nearly laid back the cover of his groups new album shows him 
dressed in a tuxedo although with a lipstick stain on his face and 
clutching a wine bottle 
big audio dynamites first album a few years back was an 
exciting synthesis of rock and urban rhythms mixed in with the 
found sounds of old movie clips the second album was a less 
exciting take on the same idea 
jones and his usual writing partner don letts are neither 
melodically adventurous nor particularly good singers so many 
bad songs tend to sound the same the group needed to stretch 
out a bit and for the most part do it successfully on tighten up 
vol 88 
jones old group wanted to save the world now the ambitions are 
scaled back no one gets 10 out of 10 he sings on other 
99 you gotta strive for five 
in funny names he sings youre not like me im not like 
you dont mean we cant get along 
their utopian outlook would sound naive if it wasnt so 
goodnatured bad doesnt take itself too seriously unlike the 
clash one of the best songs here just play music rejects 
rock star trappings and suggests good music is really quite simple 
thats not just a lyrical approach bad uses some familiar 
chuck berry riffs borrows from the old standard battle of new 
orleans and generally goes for straightforward rock on this 
album but many of the songs are sweetened by synthesizers and few 
have a particularly hard edge 
big audio dynamite can consider this a rebound from the 
sophomore slump

hot water mca jimmy buffett 
 
there was a time when jimmy buffett sang cleverly and sometimes 
even movingly about everything from life love and loneliness to 
cheeseburgers gas station robberies and the sea 
that was more than a decade ago now before buffett began a 
long sad slide that finds him again in hot water 
desperately trying to breathe life into the cliche that he has 
become americas official tropical hedonist 
the new lp is cruiseline predictable he softly sings the 
praises of the louisiana air or as he affectedly sings en 
francais lair de la louisiane only a dozen years after he 
sang the same song about biloxi one state away here comes the 
prince of tides there goes the king of somewhere hot 
this isnt rock n roll this is the weather channel 
musically things are little better theres an allstar guest 
list steve winwood the neville brothers even grover washington 
jr but what you hear here mon is the misplaced sound of steel 
drums 
and if the pseudocaribbean schtick werent wearing thin by now 
hot water finds buffett pretentious three of these songs 
begin with spoken soliloquies and meanspirited when hes not 
complaining that his songs arent on the radio hes bordering on 
misogyny complaining that babys gone shopping when she ought 
to stay home forsaking bimbo limbo to search for a smart 
woman in a real short skirt 
buffetts magic with his audience has been that they wished they 
could live their lives like his songs songs like these make it 
hard to remember why anyone ever felt that way

kirk douglas autobiography the ragmans 
son has spent weeks on nonfiction bestseller lists a position 
generally accorded such female stars as lauren bacall shelley 
winters and ingrid bergman 
how did douglas make the magic list when other actors have 
failed the secret may be that his book is just as frank intense 
and combative as the publics image of kirk douglas over the past 
four decades 
douglas has never walked away from a fight many a producer 
director and costar can recall scars acquired in encounters with 
kirk he turned his back on a sevenyear contract from hal wallis 
at a time when most actors would grab it he defied the industry 
powers by hiring the blacklisted dalton trumbo to write 
spartacus 
as revealed in the ragmans son he romanced a wide range of 
hollywoods glamour queens including joan crawford gene tierney 
marlene dietrich ann sothern and rita hayworth 
douglas seems to be a man who got everything he wanted but he 
had two great frustrations he was madly in love with pier angeli 
but despite their engagement he could never escape her 
everpresent parents he starred in one flew over the cuckoos 
nest on broadway but could never make a movie deal he became too 
old for the role and son michael coproduced the film which won 
an academy award for jack nicholson 
douglas a vigorous 69 recently reminisced about his life and 
times at the beverly hills offices of bryna productions named for 
his mother he told of the inception of his autobiography 
i was driving to palm springs one day and i saw a sailor 
hitchhiking i had been in the navy so i picked him up when he 
got in the car he looked at me and said do you know who you are 
well i thought about that and its an interesting 
question he said 
the actors search for kirk douglas led him to issur 
danielovitch the son of illiterate russianjewish immigrants in 
amsterdam ny the father was a cold distant brawling alcoholic 
whose love neither issur nor kirk could achieve 
its a terrible thing for a young kid who has a father whos 
so physically strong said douglas you think my god i can 
never be that strong i can never be that big my father was a rag 
man yet to me he was somebody so living with my six sisters and 
my mother i had no identity 
when my father left i thought why am i not with my father 
im a boy why am i with the women 
young issur escaped the suffocating female atmosphere to 
attend st lawrence college and he never went home again except 
for brief visits he discovered acting in college went on to new 
york where his looks like carved granite and intense style 
attracted hollywood offers and he went on his own terms 
from the very beginning i was always independent a 
maverick he remarked i didnt belong to any studio there 
were good things about that but there were bad things too it was 
lonely everybody else belonged to studios and they were going to 
singing and dancing lessons 
there were a lot of good things to be said for the oldtime 
studio system that i did not belong to they developed stars and 
got parts for them in movies i wasnt part of that i was sort of 
outside 
douglas film career has been marked by an affinity for forceful 
heroic roles from his part as a calculating boxer in 1949s 
champion to his depiction of vincent van gogh in 1956s lust 
for life both films earned him academy award nominations 
in spartacus perhaps douglas greatest role he starred as 
the leader of slaves rebelling against republican rome at the same 
time douglas has shown a flair for the comic especially as a 
sharptongued inmate in the 1970 movie there was a crooked man 
his first film role came in 1946s the strange love of martha 
ivers and his last appearance was in the 1987 nbc production of 
inherit the wind douglas has been known for his frankness and 
he had these evaluations about some of his friends and colleagues 
john wayne one of the most remarkable men i ever worked with 
we never got along though we did four pictures together 
politically we were complete opposites 
burt lancaster i like burt hes quite different for 
example hes a great lover of music and opera most people would 
never expect that of burt if i ever need burt i call him if he 
needs me he calls me its a wonderful relationship 
barbara stanwyck who starred in his first film she was 
pretty tough with me at first i was new didnt know anybody and 
she sort of ignored me for two weeks but i always forgive any 
slights like that when i see talent and a professional attitude 
robert mitchum never my kind of guy i always kidded him 
about those stories hed tell about being a hobo they seemed to 
change every time he told them but obviously he is a talented guy 
and listen hes had a tremendous career 
michael douglas the nicest thing i can say about michael is 
what i put in a note some time ago he told me its the only note 
of mine he has kept i said to him michael im more proud of how 
you handle your success than i am of your success and i think 
well still be hearing a lot from him 
kirk douglas kirk douglas issur danielovitch the 
ragmans son ive taken 450 pages to try to explain who i am and 
im not sure i know yet 
the best way to sum it up would be in the character of 
mcmurphy in one flew over the cuckoos nest the role i so 
desperately wanted to play on the screen mcmurphy tries to lift 
this piece of machinery and fails theyre all looking and feeling 
sorry for him he turns to face them and says but i tried 
dammit i tried

the lights go up on carmen to reveal an 
extravagantly gaudy junkyard that owes as much to west side 
story as it does to the fiery passions of composer georges bizet 
another night sees giacomo puccinis tosca updated to the 
fascist rome of world war ii and performed on a tilted stage 
the two productions are the season openers at the english 
national opera a company that is making an international name for 
itself not only on the strength of its singing but for its 
imaginative stagings 
launched by lilian baylis as the sadlers wells opera in 1931 
the company moved to its present home the 2358seat london 
coliseum in 1968 it changed its name to the english national 
opera in 1974 and has since gathered a burgeoning reputation for 
productions that prize the work over individual stars and artistic 
vision over vanity vehicles 
we are a theater and not a museum music director mark elder 
said in an interview theater needs to be exploratory renewing 
inquisitive its not just a matter of doing the old classics 
in a sensationalistic way 
indeed not for although the eno has launched its 21st season at 
the coliseum with two warhorses tosca and carmen the 
breadth of its repertory also includes broadway musicals stephen 
sondheims pacific overtures and commissioned british works 
such as david blakes the plumbers gift 
nov 9 sees the european premiere of philip glass the making 
of the representative for planet 8 the american composers first 
work at the eno since akhnaten in 1985 in december eno mounts 
the first professional british staging of nikolai rimskykorsakovs 
1895 christmas eve in january the eno will have the british 
debut of aribert reimanns lear based on the shakespeare 
tragedy 
its the same eclectic mix of the tested and the untried that 
has wrought what nicholas kenyon in the new york times called a 
revolution in the standard of theater being offered to 
operagoers 
i take for granted that eno is the reference point of 
adventurous living music theater said peter jonas the 
companys artistic director 
opera took a long time to be accepted as essential in british 
life weve done a certain amount to help that 
the eno is responsible for 46 percent of the annual operatic 
activity in britain during its 10month 198889 season the 
company will present 204 performances of 18 operas in what jonas 
calls one of the heaviest repertory systems in the world 
production costs range from 33500 to 295000 the upper 
figure is about half the cost of the most expensive productions at 
the royal opera house covent garden the enos principal london 
rival 
in 1984 the company toured five american cities winning raves 
from houston to new york with works ranging from giuseppe verdis 
1851 rigoletto transplanted to new yorks little italy a 
century later to benjamin brittens patriotic 1953 gloriana 
the companys whitetieandtails version of the mikado was 
to be broadcast by pbs in late october in spring 1990 plans are 
in the works to perform a czech opera and kurt weills 1949 
street scene in the soviet union 
wherever the eno appears one constant remains it presents all 
foreignlanguage operas in english translations whether its 
prokofiev or puccini mozart or massenet 
what is missing is the texture of the original language 
said british soprano josephine barstow 
but barstow understands the policy even if she didnt always 
agree with it the fact that the eno always does perform in 
english is one reason why the audience has such a high level of 
concentration nowhere in the world have i personally encountered 
such concentration audiences come to listen and to think 
she said it proved useful to performers too 
its an enormous advantage to young singers to sing a major 
role like salome in their own language said barstow who first 
sang richard strauss vengeful heroine for the eno in 1975 its 
quite easy to learn opera in a language you speak reasonably well 
familiar works fuel the debate a new production of verdis la 
traviata won mixed reviews both for peculiarities of its staging 
and lapses in translation 
but earlier stagings in english of dmitri shostakovichs 
lesserknown lady macbeth of mtsensk and leos janaceks the 
makropolous case both starring barstow helped secure those 
operas exalted positions within the world repertory 
in november barstow travels to the san francisco opera to sing 
lady macbeth for the first time in russian which she might 
never have done had she not attempted it first in english 
ive tried out a lot of roles with the eno before ive done 
them elsewhere said barstow 
she is one of several singers who has reached international 
status through the eno others include thomas allen felicity lott 
and richard van allan 
in september she appeared as a soloist in beethovens ninth 
symphony under the boston symphony orchestra in 198990 she is 
scheduled to sing the marschallin in strauss der rosenkavalier 
at the houston grand opera 
peter jonas is pleased that alumniturnedstars more often than 
not return to their roots you do pinch yourself and think oh 
hes lost to us but quite a few come back in very favorable 
positions 
i suppose im one of the most loyal ones if you like said 
barstow who acknowledges the eno as home base 
its comforting to feel you belong somewhere in the whole big 
world of opera

marti jones doesnt want to take over the whole 
world just a small part 
i dont have that drive to want to be this huge superstar 
because im just having fun doing what im doing said jones 
whose third album used guitars was released this summer 
but id be stupid not to notice when people hear the record on 
the radio they go out and buy it i can go to washington dc 
and play halls fill 1400seat halls other places with no 
airplay you get maybe 50 people saying who is she 
jones has slowly accumulated a following over the last few 
years earning praise for interprations of songs by john hiatt and 
graham parker and for the original material created by herself and 
producer don dixon 
its tempting to define jones as a critics choice someone 
who receives good reviews but doesnt sell many records jones 
would like to be successful both artistically and commercially not 
just for herself but for the songwriters she covers 
that spirit came out this summer at a concert at the bottom 
line in new york when jones brought out many of the songwriters 
featured on used guitars those appearing included hiatt 
parker and the team of janis ian and kye fleming who wrote two 
songs on the new record 
we had so much fun jones recalled everybody tossed their 
egos out the door everybody rooted for everybody else nobody 
complained about having enough time 
nobody got paid we covered their expenses for traveling and 
that was it what a bunch of pals it was just the whole spirit of 
the thing it was like dick clarks cavalcade of stars everybody 
does their best five songs 
jones who still lives in her native ohio grew up in the 1960s 
hearing a wide variety of music 
my parents had burl ives and the kingston trio she said 
my sisters listened to top 40 the beatles temptations and 
supremes later i went into the heavy joni mitchell scene but at 
the same time id take out a jimi hendrix record and put it on 
she began singing at an early age and idolized the late country 
legend patsy cline but jones own vocals can best be compared to 
the british singer dusty springfield 
i started reading reviews and they kept saying dusty 
springfield dusty springfield and i thought what does she 
sound like dixon had this compilation of british hits and we 
listened to it and i went theyre right im really flattered 
shes a great singer it was eerie 
jones was in her first band color me gone when she met 
dixon now her husband and also producer of rem 
somebody had the brilliant idea to rerecord two of the six 
songs on the album she said rolling her eyes we had already 
done them 20 million times in 20 million ways 
they flew in don dixon as a candidate for a producer i really 
liked him he was a nice guy he had this attitude that nothings a 
big deal great attitude 
after jones left the group dixon got in touch with her 
he said i caught your name at the bottom of my drawer and i 
always liked your singing what are you planning on doing the 
record label put the two of us together 
jones credits dixon with helping develop her own sound 
i wasnt sure what my sound was as a singer because i had been 
singing songs that were not really the kind i wanted to sing 
jones said 
he helped me pick out songs and built my confidence up 
jones first album unsophisticated time came out in 1984 
and has set the tone for her career so far original songs and 
covers good reviews and poor sales 
the record company didnt push the record they thought it 
sounded like a demo she said 
match game released in 1986 continued the pattern jones 
combined original songs with covers of elvis costello and marshall 
crenshaw among others 
used guitars has 11 songs three of them dixonjones 
originals the songs range from ruby a bluesy ballad written 
by ian and fleming to the mainstream pop of tourist town a 
dixonjones composition 
the creative process of covering a song can be compared to 
an actor reading a script taking words written by someone else 
and turning them into the artists own personal experience 
jones isnt concerned about how many of her own songs are put on 
each album she believes in using the best material possible no 
matter who wrote it 
hopefully people are opening up a little more to realizing a 
song is a song and it doesnt matter if the persons whos singing 
it wrote it she said i could write an albums worth of 
material in two weeks but i dont think it would be good enough

karen makes 250000 a year working for ef 
hutton and prides herself on being a shark anita runs miles 
every day but has been bulimic for eight years marjorie has made 
straight as all her life but panics and overprepares for every 
test 
what all these women have in common says colette dowling is an 
overwhelming desire to achieve perfection in her book perfect 
women summit 1895 dowling argues that this striving for 
everhigher goals hours of aerobics every day 60hour work 
weeks making every meal from scratch is not a healthy exercise 
to fulfill ones potential but a desperate scramble to fill an 
inner void 
an artistic drive is satisfying a drive to perform is not 
its a kind of rigid compulsive kind of a symptom as 
compared to something thats really joyful and selfexpressive and 
gives back to us the author said 
dowling best known for her 1981 best seller the cinderella 
complex recently talked about her new book in an interview at 
her publishers office 
the whole drive to be perfect comes out of a feeling of 
inferiority she said we wouldnt even be interested in the 
idea of perfection if there wasnt something that we 
psychologically were compensating for 
asked why she thinks this striving for perfection is unique to 
women dowling said women as an entire gender have been 
disparaged culturally for eons and its a particular kind of 
gender feeling about self that gets handed down from the mother to 
the daughter 
and now that theres so much opportunity available to women i 
think weve just stepped into a new kind of performance arena i 
think were using our achievements to bolster our selfesteem in 
the way we used to use our appearance or our cooking or our 
housekeeping skills or whatever 
she cites a litany of symptoms from which these overachievers 
suffer anorexia and bulimia drug and alcohol problems compulsive 
shopping all except the drug and alcohol abuse are overwhelmingly 
female problems 
the premise of the cinderella complex was that women had a 
deepseated belief that they could not take care of themselves 
that despite the gains of the womens movement they were still 
waiting for a prince charming to whisk them off to happily ever 
after 
dowling 50 said that work was based on her own experience in 
the 1970s after ending a 9yearmarriage to an alcoholic she 
moved in with a man she still lives with in new yorks hudson 
valley there dowling who had supported herself and her three 
children as a freelance writer abandoned her career and became a 
fulltime housewife her partners refusal to accept her 
dependency as well as the therapy she was undergoing gave her the 
initiative to write the cinderella complex 
perfect women is similarly based on dowlings personal 
experience the author found that despite the success of the 
cinderella complex 26 weeks on the bestseller list she still 
felt insecure about her work and at a loss for her next project 
at the same time her eldest daughter gabrielle a star 
scholar athlete and beauty dropped out of harvard university and 
revealed that she had been bulimic for years dowling realized that 
her own relentless drive for success so she could like herself 
had been passed down to her daughter 
in perfect women dowling cites psychological studies 
detailing the motherdaughter relationship that starts at the crib 
they mothers are not overly involved with us daughters as 
separate persons theyre overly involved with us as extensions of 
themselves dowling said this sticky kind of bonding is very 
unique to the motherdaughter relationship this is not to say boys 
dont have their own problems because god knows they do but this 
is something very specific to the gender 
the way for a woman to get off the perfection treadmill she 
said is to psychologically separate herself from her mother which 
can be done through therapy selfexploration perhaps 
confrontation 
perfect women suffers from the kind of generalized 
prescription that most selfhelp books offer but if it makes a few 
selfimprovement junkies stop buying these kinds of pop psychology 
books and learn to accept themselves as they are then its done 
its work

firebrand fiddler charlie daniels called 
the devil a nasty name in his millionselling record the devil 
went down to georgia he also told the russians where they could 
go in his song in america 
his new album homesick heroes is less polemical and 
contains music that best portrays his bands style 
its what we are he said hard driving music 
the rollicking album is the 18th in 17 years for the 
irrepressible fivepiece rockcountry band that has performed in 
all 50 states and several foreign countries 
in it daniels plays a blazing fiddle to the flash point in 
boogie woogie fiddle country blues a hit single he plays 
rousing guitar licks on other songs and sings sassy gritty vocals 
on still others 
the lp is a turn away from his last album powder keg which 
he described as the most rockoriented lp he has recorded 
it didnt do too well at all daniels said in an interview 
its still selling but it never really got off the ground 
it was time for a change the new album is a career move 
country fans will welcome the sound from the kingfish of 
southern roots music whose traditional garb is a huge bullrider 
cowboy hat cowboy boots jeans and vest 
he and his band are best known for their grammywinning 1980 
hit the devil went down to georgia the story of a feverish 
fiddle contest between the devil and a boy named johnny in which he 
called the devil a mild obscenity the single sold 16 million 
copies and the million mile reflections album that contained it 
sold 23 million 
it had mass appeal daniels said about the song i guess 
the lyrics of the song were responsible for 7075 percent of the 
popularity and the fiddle and the novelty value had a lot to do 
with it 
the blunt lyrics in that song were similar to the ones in his 
in america in which he issued his memorable directive to the 
soviets amid a burst of american pride 
on topical subjects daniels american farmer focused on the 
plight of agriculture in the mid1980s still in saigon was 
about a former soldier haunted by his vietnam experience other 
songs by the band such as long haired country boy and uneasy 
rider are more satirical 
i poke fun at rednecks hippies politicians all kinds of 
people said daniels a native of wilmington nc 
the band traveled 75000 miles last year making 116 concert 
stops in 1986 they grossed nearly 14 million and drew more than 
750000 paid admissions 
amid all the travel and hit records daniels has done a little 
acting he was in murder she wrote and lone star kid on 
the public broadcasting service 
he and the band were featured in the movie urban cowboy 
and their strokers theme was the title track for burt 
reynolds movie stroker ace 
daniels writing has not been restricted to songs in 1985 he 
wrote a book of short stories the devil went down to georgia 
daniels said one of his proudest achievements has been keeping 
his band members together so long three members have been with him 
at least 14 years 
it seems like ive had taz digregorio his keyboard player 
since two days after he was born daniels said 
were sincere he said about the bands success and its 
togetherness i keep a 12month payroll we have the philosophy 
that we do the best we can all the time we get to stretch out some 
as musicians everybody gets to use their ideas and share in the 
songwriting royalties i try to treat people well and look after 
our folks 
we try real hard he said i want to do the best i can do 
cut every record the best write every song the best do every show 
the best have the most efficient organization in the music 
business 
i want the deejays to pick up a charlie daniels band record 
and say heres a record by the charlie daniels band and i want to 
play this 
quality you cant beat it

a mexican mite is being tested 
against the colorado potato beetle that also devastates tomatoes 
and eggplants a chinese wasp may stop a butterfly that eats 
broccoli cabbage and brussels sprouts 
humans increasingly have allies in the enemy camp in the war on 
insects 
biological controls like these and others using insects against 
problem plants have been used commercially for more than 100 years 
racking up hundreds of successes in the last 10 years though 
interest has grown 
last year for example the federal government spent more than 
85 million on nearly 800 biological control projects four times 
the number in existence a decade ago said jim cate of the us 
agriculture department 
we are now just getting back into an era where entomologists 
are realizing you cant solve the problem with pesticides alone 
said robert metcalf who has worked more than 50 years on pest 
controls for a long time there were advocates of the sole use of 
each one now i think youll find almost everybody agrees you need 
a little of each 
there are many different crop pests that have been serious and 
are not serious because they have been able to find biological 
controls said patrick logan a university of rhode island 
entomologist working on potato beetles 
the mites chrysomelobia lapidomerae eickwort live on adult 
beetles and suck fluid from them up to 2000 can infest each 
beetle they can shorten the beetles lifespans up to 50 percent 
reducing the number of eggs laid and they hinder the beetles 
flying ability reducing migration logan said 
university of massachusetts researchers are studying a inch 
wasp from northwest china named apanteles rubecula which inserts 
its tiny needle into a cabbage butterfly larva and lays eggs the 
wasp larvae eat the pest 
the wasps have flourished in a patch of collard greens in 
deerfield mass and have attacked an estimated 40 percent of the 
butterfly larvae in the field said entomologist roy van dreische 
the needles are too small to hurt humans 
most insects became pests after their natural environments were 
upset letting them run rampant others were accidentally imported 
on vegetables and plants to areas where they had no natural 
predators 
biological controls seek to restore natures balance 
its a totally natural way to regulate pest populations 
said metcalf 72 a professor at the university of illinois in 
urbana and a member of the national academy of science it 
doesnt pollute it doesnt cost anything if it works its 
selfregulating and selfcorrecting 
still biological controls arent always sucessful and can be 
virtually ineffective as with the gypsy moth 
the gypsy moth escaped from a massachusetts researcher in 1882 
as he was trying to cross it with a silkworm to make stronger silk 
it feeds on oak trees and occassionally neighborhood rose gardens 
but isnt a problem in its native europe where more than 100 
insects prey upon it metcalf said 
in this country it can make a forest look like winter in 
june sad tom odell a research entomologist at the us forest 
research service in hamden conn this year the moth ravaged areas 
of virginia and washington dc 
from 1905 to 1911 researchers brought 2 million species of the 
moths natural enemies from europe and the soviet union said 
logan but the effort failed because in europe there are a large 
number of natural enemies each of which controls a small number 
of the moths of the 127 species introduced against the moth only 
eight have survived in this country said odell 
its not like some of the other pests where weve been able to 
to find a single natural enemy that regulates it logan said 
one of 225 successful uses of biological controls was against 
the cottony cushiony scale which almost wiped out the california 
citrus industry after it was inadvertently brought to the united 
states in the 1880s said cate who is also a researcher at texas a 
amp m university 
an agriculture department entomologist brought the vendalia 
beetle a type of ladybug and a natural enemy of the scale from 
australia said metcalf that worked until after world war ii when 
ddt killed off the beetle 
in fact many pests became a problem when pesticides killed 
their natural enemies logan said but pesticides can also be 
ineffective because the harmful insects develop a tolerance to the 
chemicals and development cant keep up 
it costs several million dollars to formulate a new material 
to develop it test it its very slow very expensive he said 
the introduction of biological controls also is slow despite 
the growth in the number of projects over the past decade the 
level of federal funding has stayed relatively stable when adjusted 
for inflation cates said 
also scientists face delays while they work to show the 
government that their controls are harmless to all but the pest 
the mexican mite being tested at the university of rhode 
island was quarantined for six months before scientists could 
prove it was a species known in this country then the government 
required tests to show it would not harm beneficial insects like 
ladybugs or honeybees 
it took seven years from the time the mite was found until it 
was approved 
reassuringly there just havent been any notable examples of 
anything going wrong with this process said metcalf 
biological controls also may be victims of their own success 
when they work people forget they had a problem said cate 
you solve the pest problem and you walk away from it 
companies that invest huge sums in research want a return on 
their investment said logan nobody is going to make any money 
off importing exotic insects cate said 
as a result smaller isolated pests like the potato beetle 
are often overlooked by the large chemical companies

almost 200000 japanese died last year of cancer 
most without knowing they had it unless they figured it out 
themselves 
their doctors hadnt told them the truth 
traditionally the japanese have been unlikely to question the 
authority of the medical profession but that appears to be 
changing as a welleducated people want to know more about what 
ails them 
and doctors are thinking about revising their ethics which have 
been based on the belief that patients are depressed if told they 
have cancer and will die happier if they dont know 
i guess about 90 percent of the doctors still dont tell 
said toshio takahashi professor of surgery at kyoto prefectural 
university of medicine 
but to jinro itami cancer specialist at shibata hospital in 
okayama the real issue is not the propriety of informing patients 
but how to reduce their fear of death and increase their fighting 
spirit 
itami four years ago founded a patientsupport program called 
meaningful life therapy seven of his patients attempted a 
moralebuilding climb of mount blanc in switzerland last summer 
and three of them reached the summit 
the earlier patients know about their condition the better 
off they are he said adding that witholding information can 
create fear and sorrow and delay recovery 
the debate of course is not limited to japan soviet doctors 
generally avoid telling a patient directly according to dr 
nikolai napalkov president of the ussr oncological society in 
the united states doctors tend toward disclosure said dr steven 
rosenberg of the national cancer institute 
itami said it is almost impossible to keep patients ignorant as 
they hear about the disease and its treatments everywhere 
but even he says that unless patients are ready for the worst 
telling them will only cause depression instead he guides them to 
want to know about their illness and its treatment it is very 
important for patients to know about their own lives and their 
condition he said 
the public seems to agree about 60 percent want doctors to tell 
them even if there is no hope of recovery according to a poll of 
5608 adults a year ago by the mainichi shimbun a japanese 
national daily if the disease is likely to be cured 78 percent 
want to know 
a separate poll of 500 doctors showed 76 percent would not tell 
the patient if the condition is hopeless 
it should be us patients not doctors that decide how to live 
the days left in front of us said haruyo inouye a 37yearold 
freelance writer who had a breast cancer operation in april 
doctors should tell us so that we dont have to waste time being 
scared because of ignorance 
she complained that her doctor had not told her the side effect 
of a hormonal medicine she took after surgery she was shocked when 
her menstruation became irregular thinking something else was 
wrong with her 
toshiro murase pediatrician and executive member of the japan 
medical associations board of trustees said its important to 
respect the patients right to know but satisfying the right to 
know is a different story 
some patients might be able to end their lives happier without 
knowing everything he said adding that japanese doctors most 
important task is to help reduce their patients physical pain 
there never has been a court ruling in japan over the issue of a 
patients right to know said lawyer katsuji hotta who recently 
was named to a committee to examine the issue for japans medical 
association 
the association has decided to investigate medical moral and 
legal aspects of medical treatment and appointed 10 people from 
various professions to talk about explanation and consent the 
group includes novelist ayako sono the president of the japan 
federation of employers association eiji suzuki philosopher 
yujiro nakamura and professors of medicine 
cancer is japans no 1 killer disease causing 266 percent of 
all deaths last year with stomach cancer topping the list

there are no dangling icicles in clark hall 
no frost on the walls and breathing doesnt produce vapor clouds 
but its still one of the coldest known spots in the universe 
it doesnt look very impressive but we are going to go a 
million times colder than the coldest natural place we know of 
says robert c richardson head of the lowtemperature physics 
group at cornell universitys microkelvin laboratory 
richardson and his colleagues using a 15 million 
superrefrigeration unit will try to achieve absolute zero the 
temperature at which even atoms stop rubbing together and creating 
heat 
we think we can take it down to between 1 and 10 
microkelvin he said and each step of the way we could be 
finding new effects 
the only other us deepfreeze laboratory is under construction 
at the university of florida labs in japan and england have hit 12 
microkelvin 
how cold is that 
the temperature of deep space minus 270 degrees fahrenheit is 
only 3 on the kelvin scale which uses absolute zero for a 
reference point absolute zero in fahrenheit is minus 459 degrees 
while room temperature would be 293 kelvin 
a millikelvin is a thousandth of a kelvin so a microkelvin is a 
millionth 
dropping from 12 microkelvin to 10 microkelvin might seem 
inconsequential but richardson adds this perspective if you 
increased room temperature by the same ratio everything would melt 
or disintegrate 
the researchers arent simply out to break records though 
the importance of this type of research lies in realizing the 
strange things that happen at low temperatures said william 
oosterhuis section head of the condensed matter sciences unit at 
the national science foundation one just never knows whats 
going to happen this research provides us with a probe into an 
area where weve never been before 
among the strange discoveries of extremely lowtemperature 
research has been superconductivity electricity with no loss to 
resistance at 4 kelvin 
sometimes it is the arithmetic or the theory behind the 
research that has the practical application said donald h 
liebenberg who helped the lab get nsf funding before he left in 
april for the office of naval research 
sometimes the technology produced has broader applications in 
other fields the most important aspect though is that these 
facilities will be breeding grounds of technological spinoffs for 
future low temperature research liebenberg said 
individual scientists have conducted low temperature research 
before but the lack of a permanent facility to maintain such 
temperatures indefinitely and allow for varied experiments has been 
an obstacle richardson said now we have an adequate tool to 
find or at least search properly for the answers to all the 
open questions that remain in front of us 
the rooms adjoining cornells 2800squarefoot underground 
laboratory are designed to eliminate all stray heat including that 
produced from the most minute vibrations and from radiofrequency 
electrical signals 
to that end they are lined with butcher block wood and 
galvanized electromagnetic shielding and have specially grounded 
electrical wiring and incandescent lighting the low temperature 
instruments are secured by concrete sewer pipes filled with sand 
the supercooling machines themselves are rigid aluminum filled 
with liquid helium copper and superconducting magnets the 
apparatus stands 12 feet tall and weighs about 700 pounds but the 
focus is on a 36inch vacuum cylinder 
to reach microkelvin temperatures a process that takes about 
two weeks scientists first polarize copper with a superconducting 
magnet then cool it to around 10 millikelvin in the refrigerator 
which uses liquid helium rather than freon gas for cooling once 
the copper is at 10 millikelvin the magnetic field is reduced and 
the copper nuclei which are now aligned and highly ordered take 
over further cooling everything in the surrounding medium 
we can never be sure what will be found said richardson 
maybe well have the good fortune to stumble upon a new science

adults in the national survey said they regard it as a risky place 
to invest and fully a third saw a good chance it will plummet 
again in the next year or two 
but threequarters said the crash had little or no effect on 
their lives and only one in 10 said their finances had worsened in 
the past year even among the wealthiest seven in 10 felt little 
impact from the crash 
there was one apparent residual impact from the markets crash 
more than six in 10 in the survey said they were being more

the dow jones industrial average dived 508 points on oct 19

economy 
there was even greater optimism about personal gains fiftyfive 
percent expected their familys economic situation to improve in 
the short term a third expected to hold steady and only 6 percent 
expected to do worse 
the survey found a receptive audience for republican 
presidential nominee george bushs theme of national prosperity 
most expressed satisfaction with their familys income with 57 
percent saying they were doing all right and 9 percent rating 
themselves well off 
nonetheless a considerable 29 percent said they were just 
getting by and 5 percent said they were in hard times 
financially the true number likely is higher because telephone 
surveys exclude the poorest households the 7 percent without 
phones 
a third in the poll said their family finances were better off 
now compared to a year ago and a 56 percent majority said their 
situation was the same just 12 percent said they were doing worse 
seventythree percent overall said they were saving for the 
future but the market was not a preferred choice for saving 
seventy percent said they had no money in stocks and 71 percent 
saw the market as risky 
among the wealthiest americans those making 50000 or more a 
year more than half had money in the market but even in this 
group 71 percent said they regarded the stock market as a risky 
investment 
even though three in 10 overall had stock investments only 6 
percent said the crash had a major impact on their lives and only 
15 percent said it had a moderate impact for a total of 21 percent 
by contrast 28 percent said the market crash had little impact 
on their lives and 47 percent said it had no impact at all a 
total of 75 percent even among the wealthiest 69 percent felt 
little or no impact 
on the outlook for the market 33 percent said there was a good 
chance of another crash in the next year or two and 26 percent were 
unsure the plurality 41 percent said another crash was not too 
likely soon 
the poll did not find broad support for greater government 
regulation of wall street while a quarter favored it four in 10 
said current oversight was sufficient and 9 percent wanted less 
regulation the rest were unsure

last years stock market crash decimated the 
hopes of nearly half the companies waiting to go public and reduced 
the amount of cash others could raise in the equity market a study 
released today said 
of the 229 businesses on file with the securities and exchange 
commission on oct 19 1987 to issue stock for the first time 45 
percent had abandoned those plans nine months after black 
monday according to the accounting and consulting firm grant 
thornton 
the number of busted initial public offerings we identified 
is unprecedented said chet borgida director of the firms 
capital markets group and head of the study 
we all knew that going public was tougher after black monday 
we just didnt know how tough 
fewer than 25 percent of the companies planning to go public 
were able to do so since the crash the study showed another 31 
percent still were on file with the sec to go public as of july 31 
those companies that braved the equities market succeeded in 
raising an average 159 million but grant thornton estimated that 
each of those same companies would have raised an average of 72 
million more had they completed their public offerings before the 
crash 
small and midsized companies were most severely affected 
borgida said most of the companies that wanted to go public 
couldnt and those that did had to settle for less capital than 
they needed 
of 51 companies that participated in a grant thornton poll 27 
said they had obtained financing from alternative sources including 
commercial banks private placements and less frequently from

despite the grim environment 86 percent of the companies 
participating in the poll including half of the businesses that 
withdrew their initial public offerings said they would 
considering going public if they could make the choice again 
as least in the view of americas entrepreneurs there is no 
substitute for going public borgida said even in this most 
difficult year for financing companies still believe that they can 
raise the greatest amount of capital most efficiently through the

japans finance minister apologized monday in 
parliament for his involvement in an insider stock trading scandal 
that has provoked a major debate over political ethics and delayed 
passage of a controversial tax bill 
responding to questioning by opposition parties kiichi miyazawa 
said he was unaware a former aide tsuneo hattori had allowed a 
friend to buy 10000 shares of recruitcosmos co stock in 
miyazawas name 
miyazawa the first cabinet minister linked directly to the 
recruitcosmos scandal did not offer to resign but expressed 
regret for his involvement 
i was truly careless miyazawa said im sorry for failing 
to supervise well 
parliament remained stalemated monday by opposition demands for 
a full investigation into the recruitcosmos scandal prime 
minister noboru takeshita also said he had been careless but 
he described the scandal as part of a larger problem arising from 
laws regulating financial dealings tax administration and 
political ethics 
several senior politicians reportedly obtained shares in the 
real estate company in 1984 before the stock was offered to the 
public the stock nearly quadrupled in value shortly after it was 
listed on the overthecounter market and the politicians made up 
to 780000 each in profits 
miyazawa admitted in parliament last week that his aides had 
bought the shares in his name reversing earlier denials of his 
involvement but he said he had no previous knowledge of the 
dealings 
last week the japan communist party released a list of nine 
people including miyazawa who allegedly purchased the shares 
through a financial firm linked to recruitcosmos the list also 
included aides to prime minister takeshita former prime minister 
yasuhiro nakasone and shintaro abe secretary general of the 
governing liberal democratic party 
the dealings raised serious ethical questions but broke no laws 
in japan where companies have routinely given politicians stock 
certain to increase in value as political contributions parliament 
has since tightened laws involving such transactions but the 
legislation is not retroactive

grain and soybean futures were mostly lower in 
early trading today on the chicago board of trade reflecting 
pessimism about grain sales to the soviet union and an increase in 
crop sales by farmers 
but early losses were slight due to the supportive influence of 
weekend rains in the midwest and relatively dry growing conditions 
in brazil and argentina which are large producers of soybeans 
analysts said 
their situation is improving down there but they still need 
rain said victor lespinasse a trader in chicago with dean 
witter reynolds inc 
the weekend rain in the midwest slowed the us corn and soybean 
harvest which is more than half complete lespinasse said more 
rain was expected today and wednesday 
on friday negotiators for the united states and the soviet 
union ended two days of talks in london without a new longterm 
grain agreement disappointment over the failure to produce an 
agreement continued to weigh on the markets today lespinasse said 
in early trading wheat was cent to 2 cents lower with

saudi arabians fewer petrodollars 
in their pockets and worried about security and culture shock have 
started looking for holidays at home and finding there is more to 
the country than sand 
in the oil price heyday of the 1970s saudi moslems flocked to 
the kingdoms air terminals to escape the heat and monotony of the 
desert for the great tourist capitals paris london new york and 
los angeles the french and spanish rivieras istanbul and cairo 
but local tourism has been on the rise for the past five years 
spearheaded by a government campaign to encourage saudis to spend 
their vacation dollars at home 
there are quite a lot of religiously conservative families who 
suffer when they go abroad said ibrahim alsayed 
directorgeneral of tourism development in the countrys 
mountainous southwest asir region they dont want their 
teenagers to copy westerners 
he added that many saudis are also acutely aware that language 
and cultural barriers make them attractive victims for con artists 
abroad 
ive traveled in europe and ive faced some of the troubles 
said fahd alsayejh public relations manager at the riyadh 
intercontinental hotel 
my familys now looking for a villa in abha there are many 
people who spend their summers there who used to go to europe 
abha is in the cooler mountainous province of asir in southwest 
saudi arabia 
he added in the oil boom years businessmen thought nothing 
of driving to the airport and boarding any available international 
flight now people are more aware of spending their money 
tourism within saudi arabia may seem like a hard sell given the 
countrys reputation as a desert kingdom lacking much in the 
way of amusement 
but beaches in the countrys eastern province on the gulf draw 
big crowds 
jiddah on the red sea attracts scuba diving enthusiasts and 
najran close to yemen offers unusual architecture for a change 
of scenery many tourists try the southwest 
the whole southwest area is very popular said antoni 
kuhnen who runs the albaha motel in that region kuhnen estimates 
that the motel opened in 1985 now books around 20000 tourists a 
year 
albaha saudi arabias smallest province is situated between 
taif where the government retreats into the mountains for the 
summer months and abha capital of asir province which boasts 
1736 square miles of national park 
its beautiful said alsayejh it reminds us of the old 
days when we used to go to lebanon every summer the mountains are 
the same 
a local newspaper noted that visitors to the abha region 
reached an unprecedented number to the extent that the real estate 
offices in abha cannot cope with the great demand for furnished and 
unfurnished flats 
an estimated 800000 visitors were reported to have made it 
despite a relatively small airport 
the recent popularity of incountry tourism is due largely to 
the government five years ago the few tourists who came to 
albaha and abha had to either camp out or rely on the kindness of 
strangers for accommodation 
now there are five hotels in the area some of them bankrolled 
by the finance ministry private businessmen are also being 
encouraged to invest in tourism 
as long as the facilities are there the tourists will come 
said kuhnen who nonetheless feels the region suffers for lack of 
recreational diversions 
an amusement park would make albaha more attractive to saudi 
families who generally have large numbers of children to entertain 
he said land has already been allocated but awaits an investor 
albaha does not lack scenic beauty at nearly 10000 feet above 
sea level the air is cool crisp and a bit damp a welcome 
change from just about any place else in the kingdom during the 
summer months 
the mountains rough craggy and dotted with scrubby green 
plants rise dramatically out of the tihama valley and are 
populated by shepherds tending flocks of sheep and goats 
baboons lope down the mountainside carrying scraps of food fed 
to them by motel staff and earlyrising guests 
the historically minded tourist can retrace the taifabha leg of 
the ancient frankincense route which originally started in 
southern oman and ended in jordan 
to the government promoting internal tourism means more than 
just providing its citizens with vacation options at a recent 
symposium on drugs development of internal tourism was cited as 
one way to discourage youth from traveling abroad and encountering 
drug users and sellers 
newspapers frequently warn readers of the travails of foreign 
travel citing examples of how unsuspecting saudis are cheated

per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
the lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on may 2 
among major oil producing states the big gainers were oklahoma 
with 10 wyoming with six and texas with five new mexicos count 
increased by three and colorado gained one more rig 
the losers included ohio which lost five california which 
lost four and louisiana which was down by three michigans count

stock prices were little changed in quiet 
trading today getting little benefit from new evidence of a 
slowing economy 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials slipped 89 to 213229 
by noontime on wall street 
gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of new 
york stock exchangelisted issues with 610 up 600 down and 563 
unchanged 
analysts said traders took a generally upbeat view of the 
current state of the economy believing that growth hasasonable basis 
lawyers for the securities and exchange commission had contested 
drexels motion to remove pollack 
i think the judges opinion was in accordance with our legal 
position said barry goldsmith an sec deputy litigation counsel 
who is handling the daytoday affairs of the drexel case right 
now were looking forward to getting on with the merits of the 
case 
attorneys for others who have sued drexel and boesky also 
applauded the ruling of pollack who is widely known as a 
nononsense judge who often rules in the governments favor in 
whitecollar fraud cases 
i am delighted by the decision said david berger a lead 
attorney for shareholders that have filed a class action suit 
against drexel and boesky he described the defense effort to 
disqualify pollack as just a litigation ploy an attempt to stall 
the evil day 
drexel spokesman steven anreder said in a statement our 
attorneys had a professional obligation to bring this issue before 
the court since it is their considered view that based on the 
facts in the motion judge pollacks position is incorrect the 
matter will be placed before the 2nd circuit court of appeals 
the sec filed a civil suit against drexel its highyield bond 
financier michael milken and three other employees of the firm 
sept 7 alleging they schemed with boesky to profit on insider 
trading manipulate stock cheat drexel clients and commit other 
frauds 
the defendants denied the allegations up to now the case has 
largely been stalled over disputes about pollacks impartiality and 
pretrial evidence requests by both sides

some housing and real estate folks are prepared 
to quash any attempts to lessen the tax deduction of home mortgage 
interest suggesting that such efforts would be an attack on the 
american dream itself 
others in the industry however question the threat to home 
ownership mainly because the current indebtedness cap the limit 
on mortgage interest that may be deducted from taxes is 1 
million 
in their view an allowance of that size benefits very few 
americans and as a corollary provides a huge tax deduction for a 
privileged few one that may have very little to do with providing 
shelter 
the issue is controversial even within the industry 
a commentary by nestor r weigand jr president of the national 
association of realtors warning that some members of congress 
wished to cut the milliondollar cap drew both negative and 
positive responses 
perhaps typical of the negative responses was a letter to the 
editor of realtor news the associations weekly newspaper stating 
that those fortunate enough to own a lavish home do not need the 
large tax savings 
the most commonly cited reason for opposing any cut in the 
deductibility seems to be that one cut might be followed by more 
perhaps even leading to eventual elimination of any deduction of 
home mortgage interest 
defending that stand another letter to realtor news cautioned 
that when congress is thwarted in attempts to raise taxes members 
could merely lower the cap on the mortgage interest deduction and 
then tell their constituents that they were able to stave off any 
attempt to raise taxes 
whatever the merits or lack of them the tax deductiblity has 
produced some situations that are difficult to equate with the 
promotion of home ownership 
it can for example encourage homeownership as an investment 
rather than shelter 
in one instance an individual can invest in a home far more 
expensive than he or she might have purchased without the 
deduction the purpose to obtain a maximum mortgage that generates 
enough deductions to offset taxes on income 
moreover any increases in the homes value is taxdeferred 
meaning that no tax is paid until the house is sold the same money 
invested in interestbearing securities would be taxed annually 
a big mortgage perhaps encouraged by the tax deductiblity 
also offers unusual leverage for an investor 
if for example a 15 million house is purchased with the 
assistance of a milliondollar mortgage and in a years time rises 
4 percent in value to 156 million the original 500000 cash 
investment has earned 12 percent 
that 60000 gain is of course tax deferred so long as the 
house is not sold moreover the homeowner may obtain an 
additional relatively low cost equity loan up to 100000 for any 
purpose and deduct all the interest 
while the issue of the 1 million cap is fairly dormant at the 
moment various proposals have been circulating through congress 
convincing weigand and others that sometime next year another 
suggestion will be made to cut 
as they see it their stand is an effort to defend homeownership 
as some critics view it however the issue is really whether a 
house should be a home or a personal bank instead

the stock market crash triggered worries about 
the destructive effects of computers but a year later the 
hightech revolution in the financial marketplace is forging ahead 
relentlessly especially outside the united states 
moreover while us policymakers agonize over program 
trading and other hightech investment tools that may have played 
roles in the crash a year ago wednesday computer advances abroad 
are raising serious questions about the competitiveness of american 
financial markets in the 1990s and beyond 
such advances for example enable us investors to use a 
britishowned computerized trading network called instinet to buy 
or sell stocks abroad when domestic markets are closed 
elsewhere from the worlds oldest stock exchange in amsterdam 
to the bourses of paris tokyo and toronto exchange officials have 
replaced order scribblers and floor traders with superfast 
electronic display screens that enable investors of all 
nationalities to buy and sell more cheaply 
im not sure were doing anything differently were just 
doing it faster said robert reid executive vice president of 
instinet a subsidiary of reuters holdings plc that can 
electronically trade stocks in 14 countries all were doing is 
automating that which weve done before 
many experts believe securities markets in general and american 
markets in particular are in danger of becoming obsolete because 
computers have made it so easy to cheaply trade stocks bonds and 
other financial items 
technology is inevitable said daniel siegel a market 
expert and professor at northwestern universitys kellogg graduate 
business school it allows people to communicate and transact 
very quickly that means the role of an exchange is more and more 
vague 
the implications of this change are profound siegel and others 
say for one thing it means the postcrash era will be marked by 
more exotic investing techniques and a need for an even faster flow 
of information rather than a retreat to traditional conservative 
patterns 
the change also means that the titan new york stock exchange 
which still handles most of us stock trading could face serious 
threats to its survival as investors find it more efficient and 
cheaper to trade elsewhere 
the nyses greatest asset is its building said richard 
niehoff president of the cincinnati stock exchange one of the 
first us exchanges to totally automate and bypass the humans who 
match buyers with sellers 
dinosaurs go niehoff said over time i just dont see 
the need for trading floors i can see a lot more at a terminal 
than i can see at a floor post 
congress alarmed not only by the market weaknesses during the 
crash but by the role computers will play in the future has 
ordered a major study into the relationship between technology and 
the securities industry conducted by the office of technology 
assessment it is expected to be done by december 1989 
the nyse also sensing a threat is aggressively expanding its 
own computer capacity to handle enormous volumes from 250 million 
shares a day in 1984 to 600 million a day this year and 1 billion 
daily in the next decade 
the exchange also has tinkered with other innovations that it 
says will enhance the ability of its market makers known as 
specialists to price stocks fairly and trade them efficiently 
keys to any stock markets success 
critics say the nyses efforts in the long run are a futile 
attempt to preserve dominance of the specialists in a world they no 
longer can control some liken the exchanges use of computers to 
an ultramodern telephone system in which all calls must still be 
placed through human operators 
other us financial markets have taken a markedly different 
approach to the future acknowledging the inevitability of 24hour 
automated trading and the possible exodus of american investment 
business overseas 
the chicago mercantile exchange for example plans a joint 
venture with reuters for an electronic network called globex 
allowing allnight trading of currency futures and options and 
interestrate futures on treasury bills 
if the merc closes down at night and allows tokyo and london 
to establish markets in its commodities it might decline faster 
said paul tattersall executive vice president for globex which 
intends to start by next summer 
the us securities industrys differing approaches to 
technology in the postcrash era have alarmed some experts who say 
a strong and unified stand is crucial 
if it aint broke dont fix it is the cry of too many 
industry leaders today junius w peake a capitalmarkets 
consultant and founder of bermudabased intex the first fully 
electronic exchange told a recent new york conference on market 
technology just because something works doesnt mean that it 
isnt approaching obsolescence or is actually obsolete

eastman kodak co announced plans monday 
to open its first manufacturing plant in japan a move that could 
be viewed as a tit for tat with rival fuji photo film co ltd 
kodak expects to open its finishing and packaging facility for 
certain graphic arts films by the end of the year said company 
spokesman ron roberts it is in yokohama and will initially employ 
10 workers 
there may be some thought that this will send a message to 
fuji that if they do more in the us kodak will do more in 
japan said peter enderlin a stock analyst with smith barney 
harris upham amp co in new york 
kodaks announcement comes 10 days after fuji held 
groundbreaking ceremonies for its first manufacturing plant in the 
united states said fuji spokeswoman carol olaughlin 
that plant located in greenwood sc will also make products 
for the graphic arts industry it will employ about 150 people and 
be about seven times larger than kodaks facility 
roberts said kodaks decision to open a plant in japan had 
nothing to do with fuji or any other competitor 
this is not a reaction to that the two are not related 
said roberts our decision is a business decision a response to 
what we see in the market 
roberts said kodak is opening the plant which will cut and 
package huge rolls of the companys film shipped in from rochester 
to become more efficient in making several graphic arts products 
that come in sizes unique to the japanese market 
enderlin said the primary reason kodak is planning to open a 
plant in japan is most likely to take advantage of currency 
fluctuations between the dollar and the yen 
eugene glazer an analyst for dean witter reynolds inc in new 
york said it was clear that the small plant is the forerunner of 
a greater effort and a way for kodak to try out running a 
manufacturing operation in japan 
it will also keep fuji nervous keep fuji on its toes in 
japan glazer said 
analysts also said the japanese manufacturing facility also 
continues kodaks increased emphasis in japan where the company 
recently opened a large research and development facility 
kodak also has introduced its new ektar line of color film 
for serious amateur photographers in japan before putting it on 
shelves in the united states

a 10 million lawsuit against the maker of a 
whooping cough vaccine that allegedly caused brain damage in an 
infant should go to trial the supreme court ruled monday 
the court without comment let stand a ruling in a virginia 
case that federal law does not foreclose such suits under state 
regulations that protect consumers against defectively designed 
products even if the federal government approves the products 
in other businessrelated cases the justices 
refused to hear an appeal by hallmark cards inc of an 
injunction barring it from selling greeting cards resembling those 
produced by blue mountain arts a small company in colorado 
agreed to consider allowing states to give larger retirement 
benefits to public employees forced to quit work before age 60 the 
case involves an ohio pension law provision that gave a 61yearold 
state employee lower disability retirement benefits than she would 
have gotten if she had been younger 
agreed to hear a reagan administration appeal aimed at making 
it easier for the government to conduct taxfraud investigations 
the justices said they will use a california case involving the 
church of scientology to settle a dispute over the power of the 
internal revenue service to obtain and use confidential documents 
the vaccine case involves tracy abbot who was 5 months old in 
august 1983 when she was inoculated with a vaccine called 
triimmunol manufactured by lederle laboratories a division of 
american cyanamid co 
her mother sued lederle in 1986 charging the vaccine caused 
brain damage in tracy and asking 10 million in damages 
triimmunol is a vaccine against diphtheria tetanus and 
whooping cough or pertussis and is administered to millions of 
children without serious side effects but it has caused serious 
injury in a small number of children 
the vaccine is approved by the federal food and drug 
administration and other government health agencies only one other 
company in the united states is licensed to produce a whooping 
cough vaccine 
whooping cough claimed thousands of lives before the vaccine was 
developed the most serious us epidemic was in 1934 when there 
were 265000 reported cases and 7500 deaths 
the abbot suit contends triimmunol is unreasonably 
dangerous and says lederle failed to develop a safer vaccine even 
though other forms of the vaccine have been used outside the united 
states 
a federal judge threw out the suit but the 4th us circuit 
court of appeals reinstated it in april 
the appeals court rejected arguments that the federal 
governments interest in promoting use of the vaccine would be 
frustrated by permitting suits alleging violation of state 
regulations federal law does not preempt such suits the appeals 
court said 
in a somewhat related issue the supreme court ruled in june 
that the government may be forced to pay damages when a vaccine it 
licenses causes the disease it was intended to prevent that case 
reinstated a suit in behalf of a boy who contracted polio after 
receiving a dose of federally approved vaccine 
the reagan administration has not announced a position on the 
abbot suit but the justice department has pointed out that 
alternative vaccines to the type lederle produces have not been 
proven safe and effective 
congress has passed a law which took full effect oct 1 
creating a fund to help compensate children injured by vaccines 
the new law places a tax on some vaccines to provide funds for 
injuries that occur from vaccinations after 1986

governments and private lenders must write 
off part of the third worlds debt if they hope to see those 
nations recover from economic stagnation secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar said in a report released monday 
perez de cuellar is scheduled wednesday to address the un 
committee dealing with the world debt crisis and the committees 
resolution will go to the floor of the general assembly for debate 
in introducing the secretarygenerals report jean ripert head 
of the uns office of development and international economic 
cooperation said that the service of their debt is killing 
investment in these developing countries 
the report before you relates the debt problem squarely to the 
current crisis of development in a large part of the world 
ripert said lack of finance low commodity prices high interest 
rates severe protectionism are leading to substantive net transfer 
of resources from developing and debtor nations to the developed 
countries 
if the present trends continue the debt crisis will remain an 
obstacle to growth in the indebted countries for at least another 
decade 
writing off debt unthinkable in the financial community a year 
ago is no more a taboo since the seven major industrial 
democracies advocated forgiving part of africas debt at their 
summit in toronto last summer according to the report 
the secretarygenerals report notes the socalled moral 
hazard of forgiving debts if that leads to new borrowing but 
notes that politicians are not generally considered successful by 
their constituents if they need an international rescue 
if the 15 most indebted developing countries received 
forgiveness of 30 percent of their private bank debt or interest 
payments due about 10 billion would be available for 
growthproducing investment the report says 
those 15 countries are argentina bolivia brazil chile 
colombia ivory coast ecuador mexico morocco nigeria peru 
philippines uruguay venezuela and yugoslavia which together owe 
about 300 billion to commercial banks 
developing nations owed a total of about 12 trillion to 
governments and commercial lenders at the end of 1987 
much of the new investment could be expected to be channelled 
into imports of capital goods from developed marketeconomy 
countries benefiting their economies says the report 
the report estimates that those orders would boost the economies 
of the developed countries by about 1 percent of their industrial 
output 
governments in developed countries should also forgive debt owed 
to them as a result of foreign aid loans the report says 
the secretarygenerals report was prepared with analysis by the 
un conference on trade and development in consultation with 
leading financiers

the us supreme court on monday without comment refused to hear 
hallmark cards incs appeal of an injunction that bars it from 
making and distributing greeting cards at issue in a lawsuit filed 
by a small colorado firm 
the ruling is the latest development in the legal dispute 
between hallmark the kansas city mobased greeting card giant 
and tiny blue mountain arts of boulder 
at the center of the dispute is blue mountains contention that 
hallmark copied a line of cards featuring watercolor decorations 
and long freeverse poetry 
hallmark contends the market should be open to competing 
versions of the cards blue mountain on the other hand is bent on 
protecting what it believes is a unique creation 
this legal battle is emotionally draining and is tiring us 
out but we are strongly committed to this fight for artists 
rights bob gall general manager of blue mountain arts said 
blue mountain arts had filed a lawsuit against hallmark accusing 
the company of copying the cards the case is scheduled to go to 
trial jan 2 in denver us district court 
given the procedural precedents this action was not 
unexpected said steve doyal hallmarks corporate media 
relations manager in reaction to the supreme courts move 
hallmark has denied the copycat allegations and it 
challenged a november 1986 injunction imposed by denver federal 
judge jim carrigan that prohibits hallmark from producing and 
distributing the cards hallmark has since stopped printing the 83 
cards in question said doyal 
hallmark attorneys had said the injunction gives blue mountain a 
monopoly on such cards that is unlimited in time and scope but 
with the supreme courts refusal to hear the appeal the injunction 
will stand 
the legal issues now to be tried concerns whether any card 
company should have the right to create a monopoly simultaneously 
with an artists completed work product said doyal while such 
a legal policy would ultimately benefit hallmark given our size 
and creative staff it would actually stifle the viability of small 
companies such as blue mountain

a joint takeover offer for eastern sources close to the 
discussions said monday 
icahn the chairman of trans world airlines inc met with the 
union leaders over the weekend said the sources who spoke on

was seeking wage concessions from the eastern unions that the union 
leaders considered too severe the sources told the associated 
press 
in addition a source close to eastern said no further meetings 
between icahn and the unions had been scheduled 
according to a report in mondays editions of the new york

hopes appeared to fade on monday for an 
agreement to end a computer industry split over the future of unix 
a base layer of software that makes it easier for different brands 
of computers to communicate 
the fight over unix has dismayed computer users who are left 
undecided about which rival version of unix they should adopt as 
their own programs that work with one version of unix may not work 
with the other 
several companies involved in the highstakes tussle are 
planning to issue a statement tuesday rallying around american 
telephone amp telegraph cos version of unix the weekly trade 
newspaper computerworld said in mondays editions 
such a group would be a rival to the open software foundation 
which includes such giants as international business machines 
corp digital equipment corp and hewlettpackard co 
although atampt invented unix members of the open software 
foundation say its development should be controlled by an 
industrywide organization so atampt does not have an unfair advantage 
with it 
atampt has said it will not join the open software foundation 
unless it uses atampts version of unix as the core of a new 
operating system but the foundation is sticking with plans to use 
ibm software as the core 
robert kavner president of atampts data systems group told 
computerworld that atampt and 10 other companies will form a group to 
develop jointly future versions of unix 
atampt spokesman dick muldoon confirmed the accuracy of the 
article although he said kavner has denied that the new group is 
intended to counter the influence of the rival open software 
foundation 
kavner would not identify the companies that would belong to the 
new unix group but said candidates would include unisys corp ncr 
corp amdahl corp ing c olivetti amp co spa sun microsystems 
inc fujitsu america inc and others 
ncr spokesman kelly kramer said there were tentative plans for 
some kind of joint statement by several companies on tuesday he 
said he did not know what it might say

upjohn co reported a 20 percent rise in 
its thirdquarter profit from a year earlier due largely to an 
increase in foreign sales and favorable foreignexchange rates 
the pharmaceutical company said monday that its net income in 
the three months ended sept 30 rose to 896 million or 49 cents 
a share from 746 million or 40 cents a share a year earlier 
thirdquarter sales were up 7 percent to 6518 million from 
6085 million 
foreign sales which account for 39 percent of upjohns total 
sales jumped 14 percent in the quarter while us sales rose only 
3 percent the continued slide in the dollar against other major 
currencies made upjohns products cheaper and more competitive 
overseas 
upjohn said its rogaine antibaldness formula led its major 
products in foreign sales growth 
rogaine was approved aug 17 for marketing in the united states 
and is expected to contribute to continued foreign and domestic 
gains chairman theodore cooper said 
rogaine now is sold in more than 50 countries including canada 
where it is called regaine 
but the us approval was critical to realizing the products 
full potential cooper said 
upjohn announced last week that rogaine was available in 
pharmacies for men whose doctors prescribe it the company said it 
was briefing physicians on the product in preparation for a public 
promotional campaign 
upjohn also reported thirdquarter sales gains for its xanax and 
halcion central nervous system agents and its micronase oral 
antidiabetes medication 
a 19 percent increase in sales of agricultural items including 
animal health products and seed also helped sales the company 
said 
in the first nine months of the year net income rose 17 percent 
to 2728 million or 147 a share from 2341 million or 
125 a share a year earlier 
ninemonth sales grew 9 percent to 204 billion from 187 
billion

chase manhattan corp the nations secondlargest banking 
company on monday reported its thirdquarter profit jumped 25 
percent while earnings rose 66 percent at no 4ranked jp 
morgan amp co and 80 percent at first chicago corp the nations 
11thlargest banker 
chase said it earned 283 million or 309 a share during the 
three months ended sept 30 up from 226 million or 255 a 
share in the same period a year earlier 
for the first three quarters of 1988 chase said it had earnings 
of 784 million or 862 per share compared with a loss of 105 
billion for the same period last year the results for the 1987 
period included a secondquarter charge of 16 billion to cover 
shaky third world debt 
morgan said its thirdquarter net income totaled 2336 million 
or 125 a share up from earnings of 2192 million or 118 a 
share in the same period a year ago 
for the first nine months the company had a profit of 7437 
million or 4 a share compared with a 1408 million loss in the 
same period of 1987 the yearearlier results included an 875 
million loanloss provision similar to those taken by chase and 
other major banks 
first chicago said its thirdquarter profit jumped 80 percent 
to 1111 million or 173 per share from 618 million or 105 
a share in the same period of 1987 
for the ninemonth period first chicago earned a record 3758 
million or 613 a share compared with a 4742 million loss last 
in the first nine months of last year when it added 855 million 
to its loanloss reserves 
chase said its thirdquarter earnings included an aftertax gain 
of about 103 million from changes in its pension plan the company 
said the results also included higher foreign exchange trading 
income investment banking fees and trading account gains 
the company reported a decline in net interest income because it 
placed about 538 million in credit to argentine borrowers on 
nonaccrual status that means the bank will no longer include on 
its own statements the interest and other charges due on the loans 
until the money is actually received 
morgan attributed its improved earnings performance partly to 
higher noninterest operating income due largely to foreign 
exchange and trading profits which more than doubled from a year 
ago 
the companys provision for credit losses of 20 million was 
unchanged from the 1987 quarter 
first chicago said its provision for loan losses declined to 50 
million from 75 million a year ago and that helped improve the 
earnings picture in the third quarter 
our progress is shown by the improvement both in capital 
ratios and in credit quality where we have the lowest provision 
for credit losses in four years chairman barry f sullivan said 
in a statement

sharp electronics corp introduced a laptop 
computer on monday and revealed that it is the source of the 
highquality screens used on a laptop from compaq computer corp 
that was also unveiled monday 
the compaq and sharp machines are the first laptops capable of a 
high standard of graphics display known as vga for video graphics 
array 
compaq said its flat screen was from a japanese source but had 
declined to say which company were the ones said sharp 
spokesman ted smits 
compaq says companies that use the same flat screen it uses 
would not necessarily have as good graphics because the display 
quality also depends on a compaqdesigned chip the company said it 
could not compare its screen with sharps because it had not seen 
sharps yet 
the machines from sharp and compaq are similar in other respects 
as well both weigh 14 pounds and have the same kinds of 
microprocessors main memory data storage and batteries sharps 
suggested price is about 400 lower at 5595 for a version with a

net income in the third quarter to a record 1239 million from 50 
million during the same period last year the company said monday 
corning chairman james houghton said the excellent results 
came from equity companies as well as strength across the board in 
virtually all corning businesses where the rate of profitability 
was the best weve seen for a third quarter in the last decade 
even without onetime gains of 59 million stemming from 
transactions in japan the thirdquarter results were a company 
record 
on a pershare basis corning returned 274 compared to 108 a 
year ago sales for quarter totaled 6254 million up 25 percent 
from 6101 million in the same period a year ago the company said

of their premium as compensation 
this completes the loss payments on all the 1176 policies 
we issued said chubb spokeswoman gail e devlin its 
premature to talk about drought insurance for next year 
chubb estimated it would have paid an additional 55 million for 
claims if it had provided coverage for all the farmers who wanted 
it 
ms devlin said she knew of no change in the status of lawsuits 
pending against the company in several states

platinum futures prices rose sharply monday on speculative 
buying leading gold and silver higher in what analysts said may 
indicate a bullish turnaround in the precious metals market 
on other futures markets energy cattle grains soybeans and 
stockindex futures advanced while pork futures were mixed 
precious metals prices appear to be steadying and may be 
charting an upward course after falling sharply last month 
analysts said 
platinum is expected to be in short supply for the next five 
years and does not face technical resistance as stiff as that which 
gold and silver must overcome to rally substantially they said 
but the gold and silver markets also have shown surprising 
resilience in the past 10 days defying some analysts predictions 
that gold was heading back below 400 a troy ounce 
theres some bullish tone for the first time in quite a while 
it smells more bullish at these levels than it did before said 
richard levine vice president of the precious metals and foreign 
exchange group at elders futures inc in new york 
platinum settled 970 to 1120 higher on the new york 
mercantile exchange with the contract for delivery in october at 
53840 a troy ounce 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold settled 3 to 310 
higher with the spot october contract at 41220 a troy ounce and 
december at 41550 silver was 4 cents higher across the board 
with december at 6475 a troy ounce on the comex 
mondays weaker dollar and higher energy markets helped boost to 
the inflationsensitive precious metals but there was more to the 
buying levine said 
its not just because of crude or just because of the lower 
dollar he said theres some momentum building here that i 
just didnt see when gold was at 406 last week 
the buying interest may be due to a readjustment of attitudes 
about inflation said paul cain manager of precious metals for new 
yorkbased deak international a large dealer of precious metals 
and foreign currencies 
gold rallied late last year and early this year on fears of 
doubledigit inflation he said those worries eased and gold 
prices fell as monthly government reports showed inflation 
holding steady at 4 percent to 5 percent 
but now investors may be growing uncomfortable with even a 4 
percent inflation rate and could be buying precious metals as an 
inflation hedge cain said 
oil prices posted solid gains on the new york merc on news that 
oil ministers of the sixnation gulf cooperation council had thrown 
their support behind a plan to increase opecs output quotas as a 
way to stabilize prices 
the proposed cap of 185 million to 19 million barrels a day 
would be less than what opec is producing now but might lessen the 
pressure to overproduce analysts said 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 22 cents to 29 cents 
higher with november at 1521 a barrel heating oil was 06 cent

midcontinent resources inc laid off 140 
miners monday and blamed federal mine inspectors for oppressive 
enforcement 
the coal company claims that excessive inspections by the us 
mine safety amp health administration including 273 safety orders 
and 1381 safety citations in the past year prevents midcontinent 
from filling a south korean coal contract 
the layoffs came four days after a federal judge declined to 
issue an injunction requested by midcontinent to halt what the 
company views as overzealous inspections by msha 
however the top federal inspector for western coal mines said 
he put roundtheclock inspectors at the coal basin mines because 
midcontinent continually failed to meet safety standards 
in 1981 15 miners died in a methane explosion at a 
midcontinent mine the companys property is in the crystal river 
valley of western colorado about 40 miles from aspen 
john demichiei western manager for msha said midcontinent 
miners shouldnt be exposed to the hazards hes found in the deep 
gassy mines 
were not fabricating problems he said a failure to 
comply will inevitably result in another incident 
diane delaney spokeswoman for midcontinent said the layoff of 
29 percent of the companys work force was too bad because its 
not necessary but until we get this worked out with msha we cant 
work 
the company is backing out of its hardwon 10year coal 
contract with pohang iron and steel co delaney said citing a 
loss of 30 million in trade each year 
delaney said the south korean company bought 80 percent of the 
mines coal in 1987 and kept midcontinent afloat during the 
13month steelworkers strike at geneva steel in orem utah 
midcontinents other major customer 
a company news release described an increasingly adversarial 
and counterproductive relationship between midcontinent and msha 
the judge who heard company arguments about msha advised 
mediation last thursday and estimated a ruling might be made in 
three or four months

arthur andersen amp co the largest accounting 
firm in the nation announced a new name for its lucrative 
consulting division monday in a move thought to be prompted by 
concerns over ethics and personnel 
the change in the divisions name from us management 
information consulting to andersen consulting creates a clear 
separate identity said duane r kullberg managing partner and 
chief executive officer of the chicagobased company 
andersens consulting service helps businesses tailor computer 
systems to their specific needs 
andersen launched a study last month to consider a possible 
restructuring of the entire company which some observers believe 
may be a prelude to splitting off consulting as an independent 
business 
the growth of consulting services at major accounting firms has 
raised questions about the ethics of supposedly objective 
accounting companies advising their clients on managerial decisions 
some experts have said the ethical problems can only be solved 
by splitting off consulting as a separate business 
consultants at accounting firms complain that although they are 
responsible for much of their firms revenue growth they are 
treated and paid as secondclass citizens by managing partners who 
came up through the tax and audit business 
the rift has cost andersen some of its top consulting partners 
including four who quit on friday to join a new consulting venture 
the consulting arm of arthur andersen accounts for about 40 
percent of the companys total revenue and is growing at a rate of 
about 30 percent a year officials said 
consulting fees are expected to total more than 13 billion at 
privately held andersen this year compared with 17 billion in 
revenue from the companys tax and audit portion

two former officials of a computer software 
company accused of misusing 11 million from a stock offering to 
buy securities and a condominium for themselves settled charges 
with the securities and exchange commission on monday 
frederick s plotkin of new york former chairman of intex 
software systems international ltd and his brother arthur j 
plotkin of guttenberg nj a vice president and director of 
intex were charged in an sec civil complaint with making false 
statements in disclosure documents between may 1986 and february 
1987 
the complaint filed in us district court in new york says 
the documents failed to disclose that the plotkins used 11 
million from a stock offering to purchase securities for frederick 
plotkin and repay loans that he incurred and to purchase a 
condominium apartment in guttenberg nj for use by arthur 
plotkin 
without admitting or denying the charges the brothers agreed to 
a court order forbidding them from further securities law 
violations they were dismissed by intex board of directors in 
march 1987 
awni k abboushi the current president of intex which is based 
in new york said it was heartbreaking that the sec was not 
extracting a financial penalty from the plotkins he said intex has 
sued the brothers for damages and compensation but said the company 
lacks the money to pursue the suit 
harry j weiss sec assistant director of enforcement said the 
plotkins were not charged with using corporate funds for their 
personal benefit but rather with failing to disclose the misuse 
he said there were no penalties possible under the charges in the 
complaint 
arthur h christy an attorney for the plotkins said his 
clients had no comment 
intex sells computer wordprocessing packages that permit the 
operator to enter text in one or more languages

two researchers from the united states 
and one from britain won the nobel prize in medicine monday for 
helping develop drugs to fight aids herpes leukemia malaria 
heart disease and stomach ulcers 
the award capped more than four decades of pioneering work for 
gertrude b elion and george h hitchings who began collaborating 
in 1945 they work at wellcome research laboratories in research 
triangle park nc 
they share the 390000 prize with sir james w black of kings 
college hospital medical school in london his research led to a 
beta blocker drug for heart disease and a drug for peptic ulcers 
i wished i had my beta blockers handy black 64 quipped at 
a news conference at kings college after he learned he won 
dr gosta garton a member of the nobel assembly at karolinska 
institute which awards the prize said the three winners were 
wellchosen 
you can see the direct working effects of their research 
said garton the entire research world knows that they have been 
in the picture for years 
the nobel assembly credited elion 70 and hitchings 83 with 
helping develop six different drugs that can be used for at least 
nine serious conditions 
they included 6mercaptopurine and thioguanine for leukemia 
azathioprine for organ transplant rejection and autoimmune 
diseases allopurinol for gout acyclovir for herpes virus 
infections pyrimethamine for malaria and trimethoprim for 
bacterial infections and pulmonary infections brought on by aids 
the assembly said their ideas also paved the way for development 
of azidothymidine or azt which is the best documented drug so far 
in the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
aids usually transmitted through sexual contact infected 
needles or blood transfusions renders the immune system unable to 
resist disease azt is the only federally approved drug for 
treating aids in the united states 
im pleased more for my descendants than i am for myself 
hitchings said from his office at wellcome ive had a lot of 
honors but the most important honors for me have been meeting 
patients whose lives have been saved or whose childrens lives have 
been saved by drugs ive invented 
elion said from her home in chapel hill nc that she couldnt 
believe she won and didnt even know she was nominated 
asked about her greatest achievement she said you cant 
discriminate among your children each one in its own time was 
the most exciting 
elion and hitchings broke new ground in finding the difference 
in the processing of genetic material between normal cells and 
cancer cells protozoa bacteria and viruses the nobel assembly 
said 
knowing those differences allowed researchers to attack 
diseasecausing organisms by interfering with their replication 
without harming healthy ones the assembly said 
black helped develop propranolol a beta blocker used to treat 
heart disease and high blood pressure 
beta blockers block the stimulating effect of adrenaline on the 
heart reducing the rate and the force at which the heart pumps 
blood through the body and reducing high blood pressure 
previously used drugs acted by increasing the oxygen transport 
to the heart in contrast blacks idea was to decrease the oxygen 
demand of the heart the announcement said specialists said 
black also contributed to treatments for stroke and high blood 
pressure 
physiologist bengt pernow another member of the nobel assembly 
said black made the greatest breakthrough when it comes to 
pharmaceuticals against heart illness since the disovery of 
digitalis 200 years ago 
in 1972 black developed another medication cimetidine which 
introduced a new principle in the treatment of peptic ulcer 
black in the laboratory has relieved more human suffering than 
thousands of doctors in a lifetime at the bedside said desmond 
laurence head of pharmacology at university college in london 
black said scientists are under too much pressure to produce 
immediate practical results i think there needs to be much more 
money for scientists to do experiments they are almost ashamed of 
because theyre so untested he said 
black was born in scotland and earned degrees in surgery and 
medicine at the university of st andrews 
elion has worked at wellcome research laboratories since 1944 
and as a senior research chemist since 1950 since 1983 she has 
been a scientist emeritus at the laboratory which is the research 
arm of the burroughs wellcome co pharmaceutical firm 
elion has been a research professor of pharmacology at duke 
university since 1983 she earned her bachelors degree from hunter 
college in 1937 and a masters degree from new york university in 
1941 
hitchings received a bachelors degree from the university of 
washington in 1927 and a doctorate from harvard university in 1933 
after teaching at harvard and western reserve university he 
joined burroughs wellcome in 1942 he became its research director 
in 1955 and was a director of the company from 1968 to 1984 
no us researcher won the medicine prize until 1933 but the 
united states has dominated in the past 20 years with elion and 
hitchings becoming the 31st and 32nd americans to win during that 
time there have been 20 laureates from other countries 
last years medicine winner was susumu tonegawa of japan for his 
study of the bodys immune system at the massachusetts institute of 
technology 
the nobels were first awarded in 1901 as a stipulation in the 
will of alfred nobel the swedish industrialist who made a fortune 
on his invention of dynamite 
un peacekeeping forces won the nobel peace prize announced 
sept 29 in oslo norway egyptian novelist naguib mahfouz last

bath iron works will pay only a fraction of a 
record 42 million fine for alleged health and safety violations 
under the terms of a settlement announced monday with the us 
labor department 
under the settlement bath iron works agreed to pay 650000 in 
fines by january to correct any outstanding violations by april 
and to drop any legal challenges to the actions by the occupational 
safety and health administration 
this settlement reflects biws acknowledgment that some 
violations did exist and its commitment to implement action where 
further improvements were needed company chairman william e 
haggett told reporters at the shipyard 
the company also believes the dramatic fine reduction and 
elimination of violations categorized as willful is a significant 
vindication of biws employees and the shipyards past operational 
practices 
an osha spokesman at the agencys regional headquarters in 
boston said it agreed to the 85 percent reduction in the fine 
because of the companys willingness to accept the terms of the 
settlement 
osha is not terribly interested in the money john chavez 
said osha is interested in the health and safety of the 
workers 
the shipbuilders union which had initially vowed to oppose any 
reduction applauded the settlement monday 
the company and union now must concentrate our efforts on 
compliance and safety rather than needless litigation said john 
stoney dionne a spokesman for local 6 of the industrial union 
of marine and shipbuilding workers of america 
bath iron works a major contractor for the navys aegis cruiser 
and destroyer programs is the states largest private employer 
with more than 10000 workers 
last november osha proposed the original 42 million fine 
against bath iron works for underreporting employee injuries and 
illnesses which allegedly occurred between january 1985 and may 
1987 osha also cited the presence of asbestosladen dust at the 
shipyard and inadequate testing of toxic concentrations of the dust 
the company denied trying to hide or misrepresent workerinjury 
records and appealed the fine which was the largest penalty osha 
has ever levied against a single company
