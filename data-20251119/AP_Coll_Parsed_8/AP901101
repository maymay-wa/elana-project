when ken kesey regrouped the old merry 
pranksters to drive across the country and maybe donate his 
psychedelic bus to the smithsonian institution he had another 
trick up his sleeve 
the bus currently on the road isnt the one that drove into the 
lore of the psychedelic 1960s its a newer model incorporating 
parts of the old and the smithsonian doesnt want it institution 
spokeswoman madeleine jacobs said thursday 
kesey and the merry pranksters became heroes when tom wolfe 
chronicled their 1964 trip aboard the bus named further in his 
electric koolaid acid test 
kesey was a bright new literary light then from his novels one 
flew over the cuckoos nest and sometimes a great notion 
this week kesey and some of the old gang boarded a wildly 
painted bus also named further kesey said they were headed for 
the smithsonian in washington dc though he wasnt sure hed 
give up the bus now since he was having such fun with it 
along the way hes promoting his new book the further 
inquiry in which the soul of neal cassady is put on trial 
cassady was furthers driver and the inspiration for the driver in 
author jack kerouacs on the road 
the truth is we had no direct knowledge of his intention to 
give the bus to the smithsonian other than what we had been 
reading in the paper jacobs said from washington 
a few years ago some of our curators talked to some potential 
fundraisers about the possibility of purchasing or acquiring the 
original bus used by ken kesey and restoring it but we were never 
successful in reaching mr kesey directly 
the current bus he is using is not even close to the 
original she added even if it were the smithsonian is not 
interested in a replica 
jacobs said the smithsonian also was concerned that kesey was 
invoking its name without permission 
at a stop in berkeley calif kesey denied he had tried to pass 
off the 1947 international school bus as the 1939 original 
he said the drivers seat and other parts from the original were 
put into the newer bus back home at his farm in pleasant hill the 
rusted hulk of the original further sits in a field 
kesey said he was miffed at the smithsonian for never contacting 
him when it was interested in restoring his original bus 
i thought it was a little presumptuous of them and it was 
time they deserved a little pranking he said 
as for smithsonian officials jacobs said they could take a 
joke but wanted the public to know neither kesey bus was bound for 
the museum 
while we appreciate mr keseys view which we think is fun 
we need more humor in our lives we want the general public to 
know that is not the case

its a tough campaign for president 
barbed with polish humor between the earthy shipyard worker who 
founded solidarity and the somber laconic intellectual he chose as 
prime minister 
what do poles think of the contest between lech walesa and prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki in their first popular vote for the 
presidency 
some call it cham vs hamlet cham pronounced ham is 
polish for bumpkin 
others have asked will mazowiecki declare his candidacy before 
or after the election 
then theres the story of a problem walesa had when he wanted to 
reserve a burial site in jerusalem next to jesus christ 
he found the cost was 150000 it goes and said to his top 
aide i dont know krzysiek is it worth it for only three 
days 
the duel between eastern europes first noncommunist head of 
government and the man who gave him the job has rekindled interest 
in politics after months of handwringing by commentators over 
postcommunist apathy 
nearly all conversations turn sooner or later to the question of 
which one will occupy belweder palace seat of polish presidents 
a man was even killed in a drunken dispute with his soninlaw 
over who would be the better president the state news agency 
reported 
poland held parliamentary elections in june 1989 that were 
largely free and democratic local elections in may but this is the 
first real contest because solidarity candidates swept the earlier 
votes 
surveys indicate the two former solidarity allies are running 
about even 
other candidates have ventured into the ring including roman 
bartoszcze of the peasant party and wlodzimierz cimoszewicz of the 
social democrats formerly the communists but only walesa and 
mazowiecki are given a real chance 
if neither gets 50 percent of the votes nov 25 a runoff will 
be held dec 9 
part of the fascination stems from their contrasting styles 
walesa is electric speaking rapidly seeming to bob and weave 
through questions thrown at him from the crowd 
mazowiecki is grey on grey in the words of one newspaper 
shy and ponderous in speech but exuding character and moral 
authority 
walesa declared early and began an aggressive campaign 
immediately with meetings at factories where he is strong and 
with academics mazowieckis turf 
in the first three weeks of october walesa visited nine cities 
saw more than 100000 people and was seen by millions more on 
television local solidarity chapters organize his westernstyle 
rallies held outdoors or in large arenas with banners brass bands 
and deafening loudspeakers 
mazowiecki made his first campaign appearance oct 14 two weeks 
after walesa in the krakow philharmonic hall which seats only 800 
people instead of direct questions from the crowd he took written 
ones that were rephrased by his campaign spokesman 
the prime minister seems hesitant about contact with strangers 
hundreds of people waited outside the hall in krakow for two hours 
and mazowiecki rewarded them with only a few minutes on the 
balcony his stilted words of thanks barely audible through a 
bullhorn 
his dedication to his job evident in his tired careworn 
appearance earns sympathy even from people who say they will vote 
for walesa 
after becoming prime minister in august 1989 mazowiecki set a 
considered pragmatic course that won respect abroad and gave poles 
a sense of security against the sudden shocks of revolutionary 
change 
to many however mazowieckis government has seemed to drag its 
feet allowing former secret police to destroy records and keeping 
communist ministers in the government half a year after the party 
dissolved 
in his campaign walesa advocates faster change and has been 
quoted as intending to use a sharp axe to chop away vestiges of 
the old system 
he and mazowiecki also appear to disagree about policy toward 
the communist leadership when he took office the prime minister 
spoke of drawing a line between present and past but walesa has 
said he wants to settle accounts with those who have injured 
poland or stolen from it 
if walesa becomes president mazowiecki says he will join the 
opposition walesa replies that he already has five other 
candidates for prime minister 
critics accuse walesa of currying favor with the mob promising 
easy solutions he cannot deliver and becoming a demagogue who could 
abuse the stillfragile democracy and frighten off western 
investors 
ill vote for mazowiecki because under his presidency i can 
sleep peacefully adam michnik a former walesa adviser told a 
rally if someone knocks at my door at 5 in the morning it can 
only be the milkman 
walesa is as suitable to be president as i am to be a radio 
announcer michnik now editor of gazeta wyborcza polands 
leading daily newspaper said in a recent broadcast 
michnik spoke with his usual stutter 
walesa wished him luck in radio

president carlos salinas de gortari declared 
thursday that his reform program has propelled mexico out of its 
economic crisis and he defended his decision to negotiate a 
freetrade accord with the united states 
but his comments made in a stateoftheunion address were 
repeatedly interrupted by shouts of opposition lawmakers 
we have left fear and weariness behind he told this nation 
of 81 million people in the nationally broadcast speech 
he assured mexicans their jealously guarded national sovereignty 
would survive a free trade pact the economic opening of mexicos 
borders and the privatization of state businesses like banks and 
telecommunications 
today new channels are open to mexican nationalism he 
said 
salinas took office in december 1988 during a protracted 
financial crsis provoked in part by the worldwide plunge in oil 
prices six years earlier 
today we have left behind the most serious aspects of the 
crisis such as the foreign debt and we are focusing our attention 
on growth and justice he said thursday 
the president also stressed stability one of the proudest 
boasts of his institutional revolutionary party the party has 
governed mexico for 61 years 
mexico has made significant progress the economy is 
recovering and has remained stable he said the political 
system despite the pressures to which it has been subjected has 
maintained internal order and been able to accomplish major 
tasks 
lawmakers from the conservative national action party and the 
centerleft democratic revolutionary party interrupted his more 
than twohour speech with jeers and shouts ten times 
salinas more misery and hunger in the countryside said a 
bedsheetsized banner held aloft by two opposition deputies 
the presidents comments about his administrations electoral 
reform provoked one of the loudest outbursts 
total repudiation of electoral fraud shouted lawmakers from 
the democratic revolutionary party which says the governing 
partys reforms of election procedure are insufficient to deter 
vote fraud 
the president however forged ahead without acknowledging 
opposition outbursts he received hearty applause from supporters 
salinas ambitious economic reforms have been called a mexican 
version of soviet perestroika 
the president is opening a protected economy divesting the 
state of burdensome industries trying to lure foreign investors 
and hoping to make mexico a fullfledged competitor in the changing 
world economy 
in his speech the 42yearold harvardtrained economist said 
he has eliminated the fiscal deficit increased social spending 
made the tax burden fairer and reduced the foreign debt from 60 
percent of the gross national product to 40 percent

while her country celebrates the end of a half 
century struggling under dictatorship rita klimova finds herself 
in a lonely new struggle 
last years peaceful revolution in czechoslovakia elevated her 
from hardship and obscurity to prominence and a challenging new 
post 
as postcommunist czechoslovakias first ambassador to 
washington she was to be the voice of a democracy reborn after a 
long night of nazi and stalinist repression 
but she had barely settled into her 10room ambassadorial 
residence when high fever and what felt like severe flu sent her to 
a hospital after weeks of uncertainty and no improvement she was 
diagnosed as having leukemia a cancer of the white blood cells 
that can be fatal 
some doctors speculated that klimova had one of the thousands of 
cases of cancer attributable to radioactive fallout from the 1986 
chernobyl nuclear accident in the soviet ukraine 
whos to say she said they asked me routinely if i have 
been exposed to radioactive material and i said no except for the 
chernobyl thing 
mrs klimova 58 and a widow agonized in a july newspaper 
interview about whether she should return home to avoid saddling 
her government with huge bills for periodic prolonged chemotherapy 
treatments in us hospitals she said she might stay if she could 
be fitted into someones research plans 
the article helped get her admitted as a patient at the oncology 
center of baltimores johns hopkins hospital she said later it is 
one of 21 facilities in the united states for comprehensive cancer 
therapy 
i sort of panicked when i found out about leukemia mrs 
klimova recalled in an interview to boost her morale she invited 
her son a 24yearold prague journalist to visit they toured the 
manhattan neighborhood where she lived with her parents during 
world war ii perfecting english with a new york accent the son 
vladimir mlynar stayed through her first week of chemotherapy 
when they actually give you chemotherapy you feel miserable 
and his last words to me after that very trying week were we 
licked the communists and youve got to lick this and then he 
left she said 
mrs klimova spent most of august in the hospital there she 
dealt with her mail and maintained telephone contact with her staff 
and capitol hill seeking support for the most important legislation 
affecting czechoslovakia restoration of us import concessions 
for goods from friendly countries known as mostfavorednation 
treatment 
the ambassador estimates the concessions could boost exports to 
the united states 82 million in 1989 by 17 million a month 
for czechoslovakia she said thats a lot of money 
restoration of the concessions had been expected in the spring 
after the two countries concluded a trade agreement but the 
followup authorization got caught in congress annual logjam and 
it finally was cleared on oct 24 
mrs klimova was back in the hospital at the time undergoing a 
sixweek siege of chemotherapy expected to last well into november 
she hopes it will be the last interruption to her new job 
i was lucky to have a foreign minister who is willing to put 
up with an ambassador who occasionally pulls a disappearing act 
mrs klimova said 
she and the foreign minister jiri dienstbier go way back 
she was once my teacher at charles university he said 
but her life changed after the 1968 warsaw pact invasion that 
ended the brief reform period dubbed the prague spring 
mrs klimova lost her economics professorship in the 
postinvasion purge of thousands of reformminded czechoslovaks 
she worked later as a freelance translator and became active in the 
charter 77 dissident movement along with playwright vaclav havel 
now the czech president and dienstbier both men spent time in 
prison for such activity 
mrs klimova became wellknown as the english language 
translator and spokeswoman of civic forum havels popular 
movement when foreign television crews and journalists crowded 
into prague during the 1989 peaceful revolution that ended 
communist rule 
then all of a sudden i found myself in the states in such 
wonderful circumstances until this disease came she said i 
hope i can get it out of the way and then really get down to my 
job as ambassador

if there are any male chauvinist pigs still on 
the prowl theyd better steer clear of linda hooper the annie 
oakley of the fbi 
she looks every inch the allamerican woman until she opens her 
glen plaid jacket to reveal a black 38caliber smith amp wesson 
fiveshot revolver tucked demurely in her skirt waist 
it would be just the thing for silencing the jeers of hard hats 
perched in the sky or quickly cooling the ardor of subway mashers 
but mrs hooper who is 39 and married to another fbi special 
agent says macho men never bother her besides she says agents 
never play around with guns 
we only shoot when our life or someone elses life is in 
danger says the orange county calif native who grew up 
plinking tin cans with her grandfathers 22caliber squirrel 
rifle 
in her six years with the fbi mrs hooper has never fired her 
gun even while chasing bank robbers drug pushers kidnappers and 
plane hijackers during her first assignment in portland ore 
but ive been in situations where ive pulled it and pointed 
it she says and i will use it if i have to 
a member of an elite club of sharpshooters among the fbis 982 
female agents mrs hooper is in charge of the indoor shooting 
range at fbi headquarters there she demonstrates her firearm 
skills for the halfmillion visitors who tramp through the building 
annually on the most popular guided tour in washington 
crouching with feet wide apart mrs hooper shreds the torso of 
a silhouette target with noisy bursts from such fbi weapons as the 
sig sauer p226 9mm semiautomatic pistol and the lightweight 
heckler amp koch mp5 fully automatic submachine gun which can turn 
a miscreant into mincemeat at 800 rounds per minute 
as a sentimental gesture she occasionally fires a 45caliber 
thompson submachine gun the notorious tommy gun favored by 
gangsters in the 1920s and 1930s which was retired from the fbi 
arsenal in 1979 
interviewed next to a glass case containing the straw hat 
eyeglasses and cigar found on gangster john dillingers body the 
night he was gunned down in chicago in 1934 mrs hooper said her 
sex has helped rather than hindered her work as an fbi agent 
i like it the way it is because i consider being a woman as my 
cover she said 
even though male fbi agents outnumber female agents by 101 she 
said women sometimes can outperform men in dangerous situations 
she mentioned the time she tricked a suspected portland bank 
robber into opening his apartment door and submitting to quick 
visual surveillance without arousing his suspicion she doubts that 
a male agent wearing a business suit could have done the same 
thing 
when i go up to your door youll think im selling avon or 
tupperware you wont think im an fbi agent she said when i 
asked the bank robber if he knew where julie was he thought i 
was some dumb broad 
even so being a woman does have its drawbacks 
i dont like those short womens jackets that are so 
fashionable these days because its hard to carry your gun under 
them mrs hooper said and the skirts without belt loops have 
forced her to use a clipon holster 
mrs hooper is no triggerhappy tv cop but a proud nononsense 
professional who hopes the visiting school children who watch her 
firearms display wont get the wrong idea 
were not trying to glamorize guns in any way but theyre 
part of what our job is all about she said i always tell the 
kids that if they find a gun at a friends house or on the street 
dont touch it guns are very dangerous

soviet proposals for an arab 
diplomatic solution to the gulf crisis are unlikely to succeed but 
could be the last buffer against war arab and western observers 
say 
there is no arab solution said a wellconnected saudi 
businessman speaking on condition of anonymity the time isnt 
right and the arabs are too divided saddam thinks time is in his 
favor 
foreign ministers from saudi arabia egypt and syria met in the 
saudi summer capital of jiddah wednesday night to discuss soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs proposal for an emergency arab 
summit 
few details about the talks filtered out 
i dont see the arab solution as being different from the 
international solution by the united nations said a western 
diplomat in riyadh who spoke on condition of anonymity 
egyptian president hosni mubarak one of the first arab leaders 
to align against iraqi president saddam hussein noted previous 
arab summits failed to come up with a workable solution saudi 
newspapers quoted mubarak as saying the meeting would become a 
summit of insults 
cairos stateowned alahram newspaper wrote that gorbachevs 
proposal serves saddams strategy of stalling in the belief that 
time is on his side 
after saddam sent his troops into kuwait aug 2 un 
resolutions have demanded an unconditional pullout from the 
oilrich emirate and imposed an economic embargo on iraq 
there was widespread confusion about saudi intentions last week 
when the defense minister prince sultan referred to previous 
territorial concessions made by saudi arabia in border disputes 
with his neighbors 
some interpreted his remarks as a hint that riyadh was willing 
to compromise over iraqs demands for a strip of northern kuwait as 
well as the two kuwaiti islands of warba and bubiyan they dominate 
iraqs access to the persian gulf and have long been coveted by 
baghdad 
prince sultan issued a statement saying he had been 
misinterpreted king fahd stressed saudi demands for an 
unconditional iraqi pullout has not changed 
the soviet union was iraqs principal arms supplier during the 
8year war against iran and the two countries have a friendship 
treaty 
gorbachevs envoy yevgeny primakov has traveled to baghdad 
twice to meet with saddam in search of a diplomatic solution but 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said the latest mission 
failed 
that did not prevent gorbachev from hinting in paris that iraq 
may be softening its stand he warned against rushing toward a 
military solution saying the coming days might bring some 
clarification of a change in iraqs position 
in one version reported last month by the soviet news agency 
novosti primakov was quoted as saying iraq might withdraw from 
most of kuwait if it could keep the northern strip and the two 
islands 
saddam has annexed kuwait and declared it iraqs 19th province 
but he has attached the islands and the northern strip whose oil 
wells are an extension of iraqs rumailah field to iraqs basra 
province 
iraq denied it was contemplating making a deal to keep the 
territories the saudis the united states and the kuwaiti 
governmentinexile have rejected any such solution 
adding to the tense mood saudi arabias progovernment asharq 
alawsat daily reported the meeting of arab foreign ministers in 
jiddah under the headline gulf crisis heats up 
the secretarygeneral of the sixnation gulf cooperation 
council abdullah bishara of kuwait told reporters earlier in the 
week that war would erupt in the gulf soon unless a diplomatic 
solution were found 
were very close to the last chapter of diplomatic 
activities he said i think well be very close to the chapter 
of inferno

more than 15 million people have been 
displaced by the persian gulf crisis world bank officials and 
other sources say 
and hundreds of thousands of workers from the third world remain 
in iraq and kuwait the numbers dwarf the approximately 1000 
hostages from the united states 1400 from britain and 3000 from 
the soviet union 
hundreds of thousands of others are returning to their distant 
homelands some as far away as the philippines and south korea 
said officials at the world bank which coordinates aid at its 
washington headquarters for the hardesthit countries 
the foreigners were lured to the middle east by the better wages 
that iraq and kuwait could pay because of income from oil 
the largest and most recent group forced from their homes are 
citizens of yemen who have been living in saudi arabia some of 
them for decades the saudi government is retaliating against yemen 
because of yemeni sympathy for president saddam hussein of iraq 
about 2 million of the 12 million people in saudi arabia were 
yemeni the newly united republic of yemen also has a population of 
nearly 12 million the uncertain border between the two countries 
runs for thousands of miles much of it through the desolate area 
called the empty quarter a report from yemen estimated the 
number of yemenis who have fled across it at 750000 
arntraud hartmann who works on the problem at the world bank 
told a meeting on refugees this week that the number of displaced 
yemenis was about 500000 but she added that it was not known how 
many more may have to go about 20000 a day were reported leaving 
in early october estimates were imprecise in part because large 
families sometimes travel on one passport 
we dont handle immediate relief ms hartmann said of the 
world banks role others do that better were concerned with 
making loans that will create jobs and do other things to ease the 
impact 
refugees need food housing and jobs and are always an immediate 
burden 
the world bank is the biggest source of aid to the third world 
lending more than 20 billion last year its staff is speeding up 
loans to the countries badly hit by the gulf crisis and is expected 
to report in the next few weeks to its 154 member governments 
peter riddleberger a bank spokesman said many countries have 
been doubly hurt they have lost the hard cash that their citizens 
used to send home from iraq and kuwait and they now have to spend 
their own money and whatever help they can get on finding homes and 
jobs for them 
in addition countries that import oil must pay the high prices 
brought on by the crisis some have also lost valuable trade 
because of the united nations sanctions against iraq 
egypt is one of the hardesthit countries ms hartmann 
estimated that 380000 egyptians have fled iraq and kuwait with 
perhaps as many more to come as abderahman second secretary at 
the egyptian embassy here said that when the crisis began there 
were 800000 to 1 million egyptians in iraq mostly farm workers 
and manual laborers 
others put the number as high as 13 million 
iraq needed farm workers and made them welcome abderahman 
told the meeting on refugees the iraqis made some of them iraqi 
citizens some were drafted and taken prisoner in the war with 
iran some will want to stay in iraq 
an additional 200000 egyptians worked in kuwait and had an 
estimated 8 billion deposited in kuwaiti banks abderahman said 
others say there were as many as 300000 egyptians 
egyptians working in iraq and kuwait sent home more than 165 
billion a year in hard currency much valued in their countrys 
cashstarved economy 
jordan iraqs neighbor has been hardest hit of all a country 
of only 3 million people it must try to absorb about 220000 
returning citizens many are professionals and skilled workers for 
whom there are no jobs in sight ms hartmann said 
fran sullivan of the international organization for migration 
which works with the united nations said india had brought home 
about 150000 citizens figures reported from cyprus a center for 
news from the middle east put the number at 85000 each from 
bangladesh and sri lanka

on an average of three times a day 
a handpicked team of armed us sailors boards merchant ships in 
the red sea that might be trying to break a un embargo to get 
supplies to iraq 
were the red sea highway patrol said gunners mate william 
bo kitchens 27 of lakeland fla a member of boarding team 
alpha aboard the guided missile cruiser uss biddle 
we should put a red and blue light atop the ship with a siren 
its more police work than anything else were stopping contraband 
from reaching its goal kitchens said after an interdiction this 
week 
the united nations authorized the naval quarantine to punish 
iraq for its aug 2 conquest of kuwait nothing but medical 
supplies are allowed in and no ships including tankers carrying 
iraqs lifeblood of oil exports are getting out 
much of the seagoing police work is done in the northern red 
sea which includes traffic coming south from the suez canal and 
bound for the jordanian port o aqaba 
the port is a potential opening in the international effort 
because land routes from there lead across jordan into iraq 
what was one of the worlds busiest shipping lanes just three 
months ago now has more warships than merchant vessels 
the shipping volume has been substantially throttled down 
theres been an 80 percent reduction in the volume of shipping 
said rear adm nick gee commander of red sea operations by the 
maritime interdiction force 
one of the warships plying the azure blue waters is the biddle 
part of the task force accompanying the aircraft carrier uss 
saratoga 
its a total roadblock this is a very effective blockade 
said capt louis harlow the biddles skipper nobody can leak 
through anything that moves weve got them the iraqis have to be 
hurting 
a ring of warships is on patrol around the arabian peninsula 
which is bounded by the red sea arabian sea and the persian gulf 
since the embargo began in august 3107 ships have been 
intercepted with 310 boarded almost all of the boardings have 
occurred in the red sea 
navy officials said 23 cargo ships have been diverted to other 
ports including 10 ships bound for aqaba or other ports because 
something was suspicious 
for example the biddle refused passage to one ship carrying 
potassium nitrate an ingredient for gunpowder others have been 
turned away because their manifests did not jibewith their cargo 
a lot of iraqi ships are at anchor in port theyre not even 
making the attempt said cmdr mark merchat public affairs 
officer for navy central command 
he said that in the gulf itself traffic to and from iraq is 
virtually at a standstill 
in a typical operation a us warship or other units of the 
multinational armada enforcing the sanctions will hail a merchant 
ship and ask its destination or cargo 
anything bound for aqaba is immediately under suspicion other 
things that draw attention are ships names that are painted over 
or ships that are sailing courses that differ from their announced 
destination 
earlier this week the biddle stopped the greek container ship 
zim venezia which was headed for eilat israel right next door to 
aqaba 
a 20man boarding team carrying sidearms and shotguns and 
wearing black flak jackets scurried down a rope ladder onto a 
26foot whale boat for a 1500yard trip to the merchant ship 
the boarding party consisting of navy and us coast guard 
personnel checked the ships paperwork and crew before it was 
allowed to continue during the mission a warplane dispatched by 
the saratoga buzzed the area

the religious dispute that has killed 
more than 200 people in nine days and threatened to bring down the 
government has its roots in a 105yearold court case 
in 1885 a hindu priest filed a lawsuit claiming a small plot of 
land in the town of ayodhya was the birthplace of the lord rama 
the muchrevered warriorgod the priest also claimed that the 
unpretentious threedomed mosque on the site was built over what 
had once been a hindu temple 
sixtyone years later the court decreed that the site was a 
mosque and dismissed the priests claim 
the legal snarl was revived in 1949 when an idol of rama was 
spirited into the building the mosque was locked by court order 
and closed to people of both faiths in an effort to prevent 
religious strife 
in 1986 another court order reopened the mosque but only to 
hindus riots over the decision killed at least 200 people 
around the same time the fundamentalist world hindu council 
called for the removal of the 460yearold babri mosque and the 
construction of a temple in its place 
the group was not particularly wellknown at the time but it 
gathered increasing support in 1989 it announced definitive plans 
for the temple construction and said it would raise 14 million for 
the project 
religious riots broke out again this time claiming at least 900 
lives 
after a year of futile government efforts to halt the campaign 
the group said hindu holy men had deemed oct 30 1990 as an 
auspicious day to start the construction 
prime minister vp singhs government vowed to halt the 
attempt although this stand cost it the support of the hindu 
bharatiya janata party the desertion relegated the government to a 
minority in parliament 
singh faces the possibility of losing a vote of confidence nov 
7 
on tuesday thousands of hindus stormed the mosque at least 
seven people died when police opened fire but many youths broke 
through security cordons raced through the narrow winding lanes 
leading to the site and planted orange hindu flags on the domes 
three more bodies were later found in a river and were thought 
to be victims of tuesdays violence 
what is most worrisome about the outbreak of violence say 
newspapers and political commentators is the widespread support 
the hindu campaign has received which could foreshadow an unending 
cycle of religious strife 
indias 880 million people are 82 percent hindu and 12 percent 
moslem but the country has been officialy secular since it gained 
independence in 1947 hindumoslem riots have periodically flared 
but usually have been sparked by local issues and quickly resolved 
india is entering a period when all the values it cherishes 
are in peril the statesman newspaper editorialized thursday 
on the survival of this one mosque may depend the survival of 
india as we know it

tough presidential talk about iraqs saddam 
hussein is dominating the news again to the potential advantage of 
republican candidates struggling to recover from tax and budget 
blues analysts say 
at a campaigntrail news conference in florida bush conceded 
thursday that mixing statements on the persian gulf with campaign 
rhetoric was a little bit awkward because we are a few days 
before an election and i want to continue to work for republican 
candidates 
its having a big political impact democratic pollster 
celinda lake said of the presidential rhetoric but she also called 
it very highrisk strategy for the president 
what hes tinkering with is the most robust part of his 
image lake said if he creates cynicism in the one part of his 
image thats still very robust hes in for a much harder 
presidency 
a sign of the kind of trouble bush could encounter came in this 
statement from rep david obey dwis chairman of the house 
appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations 
if the president wants politics to end at the waters edge he 
has an obligation to leave events beyond the waters edge out of 
campaign politics 
the agenda has switched to foreign policy said democratic 
pollster peter hart 
he bush has been very effective in moving the agenda at 
least somewhat off the focus on the budget and off taxes said 
lake i think he figured out he could not reshape voters 
impressions about taxes so that he had to get voters minds off 
of that 
at a briefing on senate races rick shelby political director 
of the national republican senatorial committee said prospects 
have become more positive for gop candidates 
one of the reasons the environment improved is the focus is 
no longer entirely on the budget said shelby 
for the past week democrats exulted as campaign surveys 
reported growing support for their party from voters who agreed 
with their contention that bush and his party were tilting to the 
rich in the budget negotiations the argument came to be dubbed 
the fairness issue 
in state after state polls found democratic candidates gaining 
ground in some cases republicans once thought to be safe suddenly 
found themselves in very tight races in others republican 
challengers dropped far behind democratic incumbents 
hart said he couldnt say if the shift in bushs focus had 
boosted the prospects of republican candidates but the pollster 
added that theres no longer the sense that theyre still losing 
ground whether theyve started dramatically to pick up ground is 
less certain 
what they have to hope for is they get a minor rebound said 
kevin phillips a republican political analyst my sense is 
theyve slapped a bottom on the domestic policy hemorrhage 
the decline that appeared to be sending republicans toward a 
major defeat next tuesday already had begun to slow after the 
budget agreement was reached and congress adjourned 
left open was the question of whether a shift of emphasis to 
foreign policy would alter the overall dynamic of the election and 
create a national issue that would turn the tie in the 
republicans favor 
unless something actually happens in the persian gulf then 
all this scenesetting is only marginal that youre not going to 
change the dynamic said phillips 
i dont think its necessarily changed the dynamics of the 
election said hart 
gop pollster robert teeter said he didnt know of any races 
where the persian gulf was a particularly important issue i 
think its important to the public impression of the president 
lake said that during the budget negotiations people responded 
to polls by saying this is a bad package bush is doing this 
bush is on the side of the rich 
now she said he has very very effectively moved the focus 
off himself in terms of taxes she contended the fairness issue 
remains potent but with slightly diminished momentum

the upheaval in the minnesota governors race 
has battered rudy boschwitz as well forcing the republican senator 
to scramble in a reelection bid once thought to be a sure thing 
he better bring out the heavy artillery i think he needs 
it said selden hanson minnesota 8th district gop chairman 
three weeks ago i didnt even worry now i hope we win ive got 
my fingers crossed 
boschwitz seeking a third term had been considered to have one 
of the safest senatorial reelection bids this year against 
democrat paul wellstone a political science professor at carleton 
college 
but his fortunes have turned in the 2 weeks since allegations 
of skinnydipping with teenage girls and adultery rang out against 
minnesotas onetime republican gubernatorial nominee jon 
grunseth 
i think it has affected my campaign negatively boschwitz 
said thursday thats an advantage to a newcomer no doubt about 
it 
as wellstone was gaining attention through a series of catchy tv 
ads the minnesota republican party was shaken oct 15 by the 
initial allegations against grunseth boschwitz initially supported 
grunseth but later urged his withdrawal grunseth bowed out on 
sunday 
the developments appeared to take their toll on boschwitz an 
independent public opinion poll conducted oct 1921 showed the 
boschwitzwellstone race a virtual draw compared with a 15point 
boschwitz lead less than two weeks earlier 
boschwitz returned to minnesota the day the new poll figures 
were published saying i have to get back and campaign 
my own political situation has gotten worse because of the 
governors race boschwitz said while campaigning in duluth on 
tuesday when i wrapped my arms around grunseth my poll numbers 
dropped precipitously 
wellstone has repeatedly portrayed himself as david against 
goliath because boschwitz had amassed a campaign war chest of more 
than 7 million to wellstones less than 1 million 
he has accused boschwitz of dodging responsibility for the 3 
trillion national debt lacking compassion for the poor and 
disadvantaged and compromising the interests of average minnesotans 
by accepting campaign donations from big outofstate businesses 
humorous television ads which show the bouncy wellstone talking 
and walking in fast motion have made the challenger easy to 
recognize and boschwitz changed his vote on civil rights 
legislation after wellstone criticized the initial vote 
now look at what the polls show ill tell you ive climbed 
on top of goliaths 7 million im looking at him straight in the 
face wellstone said at a rally last week 
but wellstone was on the defensive this week after boschwitz 
said the challengers national health care plan would result in the 
shutdown of the mayo clinic and that wellstones spending proposals 
would require a doubling of taxes 
the senator also said wellstone had been arrested for 
trespassing during protests against the vietnam war and the farm 
crisis and he caused a stir when he called on wellstone to 
renounce a plan by a street gang to pass out democratic campaign 
literature wellstone said he didnt know of the plan 
he has gone after me and after me and after me for 10 weeks 
with very very negative stuff boschwitz said thursday so the 
time had come to take the offensive nobody was explaining and 
defining paul wellstone thats what we wanted to do so that 
people understood what he was about and what he was saying 
and boschwitz hoped to get a big boost today with president 
bushs appearance in rochester on his behalf 
political science professor charles backstrom of the university 
of minnesota said that either boschwitz is running scared or wants 
his supporters to think he is 
he wants his supporters to come out and work for him and 
vote backstrom said 
you really want them working their hardest and their best in 
the last 10 days said dj leary a longtime democratic 
political consultant 
wellstone campaign manager john blackshaw discounted the notion 
that boschwitz was merely pretending to be nervous 
i think he is legitimately scared i hesitate to think that he 
is that arrogant to think he doesnt have any problems in his own 
senate race blackshaw said 
boschwitz ally vin weber a minnesota republican congressman 
believes the narrowing gap between boschwitz and wellstone is part 
of the national backlash republicans are feeling over tax increases 
and medicare cuts in the federal budget 
its not a boschwitz problem its a republican problem 
weber said

iraqi troops seized scores of documents when 
they invaded kuwait but the papers are unlikely to compromise the 
united states because of kuwaits limited intelligence service 
officials and private analysts say 
they obviously got a lot of documents said ali alsabah a 
spokesman for the kuwait embassy they have to sift through them 
and they have the labor to do that 
attention focused on kuwaiti documents wednesday when iraqi 
ambassador mohamed almashat released one he said was taken from 
files at kuwaits internal security bureau after the aug 2 
invasion 
but officials said the fact that the documents belonged to 
kuwait makes the situation different from 1979 when iranian 
revolutionaries seized the us embassy in tehran 
in that instance iranian students pieced together shredded us 
documents in an effort to gain some insight into official american 
activities in iran 
diplomats at the us embassy in baghdad are known to have 
shredded sensitive documents according to us officials 
it is likely that the handful of diplomats trapped at the us 
embassy in kuwait have done the same thing said neil livingstone 
an adjunct professor at georgetown university who is a specialist 
on terrorism 
livingstone said he doubted the iraqis have learned much about 
us intelligence from the kuwaiti documents 
this is not the rolls royce of intelligence services he 
said they didnt have wide knowledge of the united states 
alsabah said the kuwaiti inelligence service was small and 
reported to the interior minister 
most kuwaiti security work involved keeping tabs on foreigners 
working inside the country we are talking about a little country 
that doesnt have a lot of assets livingstone said 
a us diplomat familiar with kuwait agreed although the united 
states and kuwait were allies washington was cautious about 
sharing secret information with kuwait because that country also 
had good relations with the soviet union said the diplomat who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the two countries cooperated in reflagging kuwaiti tankers 
during the iraniraq war in 1987 but much of that information 
would be dated officials said 
of more concern to the united states is the military hardware 
that iraq stole from kuwait livingstone said 
they got a lot of goodies out of kuwait he said there have 
been unconfirmed reports that iraq has seized usmade hawk 
missiles that were sold to kuwait 
even so livingstone said the united states did not have a large 
military presence in kuwait 
the memo provided wednesday by almashat purports to be from the 
director general of the state security department to the kuwaiti 
interior minister detailing a meeting the security chief had with 
cia director william webster on nov 14 1989 
in the document kuwaiti brig fahd ahmad alfahd said he and 
webster agreed on a number of points among them 
we agreed with the us side that it was important to combat 
drugs in the country after the cia narcotics experts informed us 
that much kuwaiti capital is being used to promote drug trafficking 
in pakistan and iran and that the spread of such trafficking will 
have negative consequences for the future of kuwait 
we agreed with the american side that it was important to 
take advantage of the deteriorating economic situation in iraq in 
order to put pressure on that countrys government to delineate our 
common border the document said 
the cia said statements contained in the document are 
fabrications 
ali alsabah a spokesman for the kuwaiti embassy said the 
document written in arabic appeared to have been altered but 
almashat insisted on the documents authenticity 
the document also provided a telephone number said to be 
websters private line a telephone answering machine with a 
womans voice answers the number

president bush evidently set out this week to 
rattle iraq but he may have wound up rattling everyone including 
himself on whether he is about to go to war against saddam 
hussein 
as a result bush toned down the rhetoric a little bit thursday 
as he came to a news conference equipped with past statements that 
matched his recent bellicosity 
some are saying there is a shift here a dramatic shift 
bush said denying any inconsistency on his part indeed he had 
called the iraqi president barbaric in the past 
i am not trying to sound the tocsin of war he said easing 
off slightly 
bush explained he was just trying to get the focus back where it 
belonged on iraqs unacceptable invasion of kuwait after some 
digression over the budget and his dealings with congress 
i am not going to discuss what or will not trigger an armed 
conflict he said 
there is no denying however that the country is experiencing a 
siege of war nerves and it extends to capitol hill house speaker 
thomas foley and senate majority leader george mitchell said 
tuesday they were worried that a growing number of people feel war 
is unavoidable 
at the very least congress wants to exercise what many members 
perceive to be its constitutional right to decide whether to 
declare war 
but bush told the leaders tuesday that while he would continue 
to seek their advice and support in shaping us policy they must 
understand that any such commitment must be hedged given the 
unpredictable and dynamic circumstances of this crisis 
indeed the rattling rhetoric one day and the emphasis in 
seeking a peaceful solution another day could be calculated to 
confuse saddam 
if that is bushs purpose he obviously cannot admit it 
nor can he explain the shifts of emphasis to the american people 
without giving his strategy away 
and yet an argument can be made that the president has an 
obligation to explain to congress and the american people what 
would trigger an armed conflict 
its hard to say whether that would provide baghdad with 
critical information to help prepare for war but it probably would 
enhance bushs chances of getting support at home once an attack 
was launched 
explaining why he had taken a hard line of late bush said 
thursday he wanted the american people to know how strongly he felt 
about the plight of the nine diplomats and others holding out in 
the us embassy in kuwait and americans detained in iraq 
some are being used as human shields at strategic installations 
to deter us attack 
bush said relatives of the hostages would be discouraged from 
accepting an iraqi offer to make holiday visits and he called the 
iraqi invitation a canard 
the emphasis bush placed on the plight of the hostages and the 
diplomats could be evidence that he indeed is now more inclined 
to use force and that he has begun to justify a war to the american 
people 
and yet in late august the president said the hostages would 
not affect his policy toward iraq that is he said he would not be 
deterred from taking military action by threats to the americans 
i will not change the policy of the united states to pay 
homage or to give credibility to this brutal move of staking out 
citizens and a brutal move of holding people against their will 
he said on aug 30 
at this point however their situation could be the very reason 
bush uses force 
he said wednesday he had had it with iraqs treatment of the 
hostages and the diplomats he accused iraq of trying to starve out 
ambassador nathaniel howell and the other besieged americans at the 
embassy 
i must keep this in focus for the american people he said

policy since 1973

gen h norman schwarzkopf commander of us 
forces in the persian gulf said thursday american troops could 
destroy iraq but such action might not be in the interest of the 
longterm balance of power in the region 
schwarzkopf who assumed command of more than 210000 american 
troops in saudi arabia in august said war could erupt any time 
but he doesnt expect it to 
president bush has stated again and again our argument is not 
with the iraqi people and that military action would cause 
thousands and thousands of innocent casualties 
in an interview published friday by the new york times 
schwarzkopf said he recommended to the pentagon that combat units 
in saudi arabia be rotated out of the country every six to eight 
months 
he said iraqi missiles would have only a modest effect on any 
military action because they are highly inaccurate and because the 
iraqis have a relatively small number of rocket launchers 
schwarzkopf played down iraqs ability to mount chemical 
warheads on its missiles

gov mario cuomo says that if he is 
reelected and cant put new yorks fiscal house in order theres 
no sense in even discussing a possible 1992 presidential bid 
thats what i have to get done thats what i ran for cuomo 
said wednesday of his current reelection bid and dealings with new 
yorks sagging economy 
theres no way you could say no thats not really 
important ill solve the problems from washington and then take 
off and campaign from coast to coast cuomo added i couldnt 
do it and i wouldnt do it 
and if the states fiscal problems are under control by the time 
the 1992 presidential campaign began 
then you talk to me he said leaving open the possibility 
of a presidential run 
cuomos comments came as he answered speculation from political 
analysts that a solid reelection win next week could set the stage 
for a presidential campaign 
national republican political strategists have said cuomos 
fiscal record in new york would be a major issue if he ran for 
president during cuomos almost eight years as governor state 
spending has grown at more than twice the rate of inflation 
in his bid for a third term cuomo has come under constant 
attack from republicans who claim hes largely responsible for the 
states budget woes theyve compared him to michael dukakis 
massachusetts lameduck governor and unsuccessful 1988 democratic 
presidential candidate 
the collapse of the massachusetts miracle was in large part 
responsible for dukakis decision not to seek reelection 
cuomo in turn has sought to blame presidents reagan and bush 
and the republican leadership of the state senate for new yorks 
continued fiscal problems 
my sense is that cuomo will be a candidate for the 
presidency lee miringoff head of the marist college institute 
for public opinion said wednesday 
hell be under more pressure than hes ever been under before 
the morning after the election said robert strauss a former 
democratic national chairman and veteran party power broker he 
doesnt like that kind of pressure but hes going to get it 
whether he likes it or not 
cuomo responded by saying that if you dont feel it its not 
pressure nobody can pressure you to make a decision like that and 
nobodys going to 
according to the latest polling cuomo is a heavy favorite to 
win reelection tuesday to a third fouryear term as governor his 
opponents are republican pierre rinfret and conservative party 
candidate herbert london

in his sharpest attack on the catholic church 
president alberto fujimori has accused the church of controlling 
minds and obstructing freedom by refusing to support a planned 
birth control program for the poor 
a sector of the church is restricting the freedom of citizens 
with its medieval opinions and recalcitrant positions fujimori 
said wednesday 
it is unethical to manipulate consciences and sow fear and 
doubt among the population 
the government wants the use of contraceptives to be the free 
choice of citizens fujimori told a national mayors convention 
in the coastal town of huaral 40 miles north of lima 
a planned birth control program was announced last week for this 
overwhelmingly catholic nation if it is not put into effect 
fujimori said perus population of 22 million would reach 30 
million by the turn of the century 
the program would distribute free condoms and birth control 
pills to the poor eight million people more than onethird of the 
population live in extreme poverty and families of 10 or more 
children are not uncommon 
fujimori a selfprofessed devout catholic and political 
independent who took office july 28 said the government would not 
make birth control compulsory for anyone but stressed that the 
population should be informed 
he criticized the catholic church for not supporting the 
governments program to encourage people to have only the number of 
children they can feed 
there is nothing terrible about not wanting children to eat 
garbage in the streets fujimori said the church wont lose 
any authority by admitting theres something wrong on the 
contrary it will gain 
the president angered church officials oct 23 when he announced 
plans to launch a birth control program among the poorer sectors 
church leaders are influential among the 95 percent of the 
population that is catholic 
the governments aim he said was to cut the present annual 
population growth rate from 650000 to 300000 by the year 2000 
peru is in the grips of its worst economic crisis in history and 
a 13monthold drought that has badly hurt agricultural production 
perus educational system which is heavily influenced by the 
powerful catholic church does not provide sex education in 
schools however contraceptives like the birth control pill are 
freely available without a prescription in pharmacies 
the church represented by bishop ricardo durand has echoed the 
antibirth control message of pope john paul ii who last visited 
peru in 1988 
from the churchs point of view there must responsible 
paternity durand said in a radio interview friday but he ruled 
out any means of birth control except for natural methods 
let the peoples conscience decide he said in a television 
interview sunday but they must answer to it up above later on

louisiana will elect its first black 
congressman since reconstruction in tuesdays election following a 
campaign marred by bitter personal barbs 
marc morial and state sen william jefferson both democrats and 
both lawyers want to replace rep lindy boggs an extremely 
popular congresswoman who is retiring after 17 years in the house 
allegations about jeffersons personal gain from political 
contacts and morials fathering a child out of wedlock have 
sometimes overshadowed other issues 
jefferson and morial the son of new orleans first black mayor 
were the top votegetters in the 12way primary oct 6 jefferson 
led with 24 percent while morial garnered 22 percent 
having virtually split the black vote in the primary both 
candidates need white support to win tuesday 
there have been no recent independent polls released but 
university of new orleans political science professor and 
researcher susan howell said white voters appear to be largely 
undecided 
its really up for grabs howell said of the white vote 
early in his career jefferson enjoyed strong support from 
conservatives and business interests which could translate into 
white support at the polls but that support appeared to diminish 
as he fought gov buddy roemers fiscal programs and other 
initiatives important to the reformminded governor 
morial still is virtually an unknown quantity among whites 
although his father the late mayor dutch morial had a strong 
coalition of white and black support 
morial 31 has leveled charges that jeffersons law practice 
has benefited from his political contacts 
my law firm built its practice not on public contracts but 
by serving individuals morial said at a forum of business 
leaders 
jefferson 43 responds by criticizing morials lack of 
experience 
if you dont do anything in life you wont get any 
criticism jefferson said if you do you will 
jefferson born to a poor family in northern louisiana 
graduated from southern university in 1969 and harvard law school 
in 1972 he clerked for a federal judge in the early 1970s later 
joining the staff of us sen j bennett johnston 
he set up a new orleans law practice in 1976 and was elected to 
the state senate in 1979 
jefferson has battled roemer on several matters including the 
governors call to abolish four state boards that govern higher 
education in louisiana and replace them with one board 
the plan would do away with predominantly black southern 
universitys board of supervisors the board opposes the plan 
jefferson is the boards lawyer a job reportedly worth up to 
195000 annually 
morial calls that a conflict of interest saying its only part 
of a reported 590000 in public contracts jefferson has from 
various public agencies 
a graduate of georgetown university law center morial 
established a law practice in 1985 
he too has at least one public contract acting as legal 
counsel for the orleans parish civil sheriffs office 
that hasnt become a campaign issue however the fact that he 
fathered a child eight years ago while a law student has 
the story broke just after the primary election jefferson 
denies having anything to do with the publicity surrounding the 
matter 
the childs mother an attorney who now is married and lives in 
africa filed suit two days before the primary and later was quoted 
as saying she never sought or received a penny in child support 
from morial 
morial said he has met all financial and moral obligations 
jeffersons campaign plays up the fact that jefferson has been 
married for 20 years and that he and his wife have five children 
it is not jefferson said an effort to paint morial as an 
irresponsible bachelor father rather he said it is to show that 
he has empathy with families trying to survive in louisianas poor 
economy 
my only point in bringing it up is to make sure that the 
voters out there know that i appreciate their problems jefferson 
said during a recent forum before the new orleans young leadership 
council 
i grew up in a family morial countered drawing laughter 
and brief applause from his supporters in the audience

drug legalization advocate anthony henman got 
a rude welcome when he arrived in the united states to attend a 
conference 20 hours in custody and three strip searches 
a federal arrest warrant for henman popped up when an 
immigration officer at new yorks john f kennedy international 
airport punched his name into a computer said immigration and 
naturalization service spokesman farrell adams 
the ins detained the british citizen at 5 pm on oct 25 and 
turned him over to the us marshals service adams said 
the trouble was the warrant wasnt valid 
the 1972 indictment stemmed from an accused drug dealers 
allegations that henman had been his supplier according to 
attorneys from the american civil liberties union and its new york 
branch 
the indictment was later dropped but the arrest warrant 
wasnt said phil gutis of the aclu this was the first time 
henman has come into the country since then 
it took until midafternoon of oct 26 for assistant us 
attorney ira belkin in the eastern district of new york to discover 
that the indictment had been dismissed in 1981 
for whatever reason that information never made its way into 
the computer belkin said the warrant as far as the computer 
was concerned was still in there basically it was a mistake as 
soon as we figured that out he was released 
henman is the executive secretary of the brusselsbased 
international antiprohibitionist league he traveled to the united 
states to attend a conference organized by the washingtonbased 
drug policy foundation which advocates drug decriminalization 
he was held incommunicado for 20 hours which unfortunately 
isnt that unusual and he was stripsearched three times said 
gutis when he was able to contact a lawyer he got hold of the 
new york civil liberties union and they were able to clear up the 
situation rather quickly 
henmans lawyers say they may sue 
mr henman indicated there were lots of apologies after the 
fact but the apologies cannot really undo the profound harm 
said donna lieberman associate director of the new york civil 
liberties union 
the computer was dead wrong and as a result an innocent 
person was subjected to deprivation of his liberty in violation of 
his fundamental rights

a medicaid break for holocaust survivors an 
award named for a member of congress and a promise by democratic 
leaders of billions in new spending for minorities are all tucked 
into the deficitreduction bill 
the provisions are among numerous obscure items in the budget 
that are only now coming to light days after congress approved the 
measure and adjourned for the year 
other language provides assistance for americans fleeing iraq 
and kuwait and money for certain centers to treat patients with 
alzheimers disease or those who may have aids 
but in a moneysaving move lawmakers decreed that deceased 
veterans using federal burial benefits no longer would be able to 
receive free headstones from the government 
it is a longstanding washington tradition for giant measures 
like the deficitreduction package to be crammed with items that 
affect limited numbers of people 
in fact rep curt weldon rpa is offering dinner for two at 
a capitol hill restaurant for anyone who brings one to his 
attention that benefits five or fewer people he has yet to find 
one 
staff tells me this is the cleanest bill theyve seen in 
recent times weldon said wednesday 
but the bill the main part of an effort to slash the federal 
deficit by 496 billion over the next five years does contain 
provisions that benefit specific groups or areas 
a report accompanying the bill contains an unusual promise by 
democratic congressional leaders to try to increase federal 
spending for minority group members by at least 88 billion over 
the next three years 
the leaders promise an effort to target science and energy 
research and education initiatives to traditionally black and 
hispanic colleges and universities they say they will try to set 
up a new federally backed bond program for new construction at the 
schools of which there are about 120 mostly in the south 
the democrats also say they will try to increase spending on 
foreign aid to africa housing urban development education 
health child care and antigang programs in inner cities welfare 
job training and veterans 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo said tuesday the 
language had nothing to do with the hunt democratic leaders made 
last week for support for the budget which the house approved 
228200 
a number of our members black and white felt we wanted to 
make investments in certain areas he said 
but rep alan wheat dmo one of 24 house democrats in the 
congressional black caucus said the provision was included after 
negotiations between black lawmakers and house leaders much of it 
came from the budget the caucus proposed earlier this year he 
said 
most of us wanted to find a way to support the democratic 
leadership and vote for the budget wheat said wednesday 
ten of the black caucus members voted for the bill and 13 voted 
against it walter fauntroy the delegate from washington dc has 
no vote on the house floor 
in another section of the bill rep ted weiss dny inserted 
language that allows holocaust survivors to ignore reparation 
payments they receive from germany when it comes to determining 
medicaid nursing home benefits 
the provision is expected to affect 300 lowincome elderly 
people who survived hitlers death camps and who each receive an 
average of 1600 annually from the german government they would 
no longer have their federal nursing home benefits reduced by the 
amount of those checks a provision likely to cost the government 
about 500000 per year 
another clause creates the walter b jones excellence in coastal 
management awards the prizes of up to 5000 will be given to 
individuals local governments and graduate students for protecting 
coastal lands 
the award is named for rep walter b jones dnc chairman of 
the house merchant marine and fisheries committee 
the bill also 
extends the life of 10 special projects where medicare money is 
being used to treat patients with alzheimers disease only eight 
of the facilities have been financed so far in rochester ny 
urbana ill memphis tenn portland ore cincinnati ohio 
parkersburg wva minneapolis and miami 
contains 30 million for medicare for two new centers 
expected by congressional officials to be in new york and san 
francisco to treat people infected with the aids virus and 
pregnant women believed to be at risk of getting the virus 
allows the government to spend whatever amount is necessary to 
provide temporary aid to americans escaping from iraq and 
iraqioccupied kuwait

all regions of the country are reporting 
either slow growth or an actual decline in economic activity the 
federal reserve board says 
the bleak assessment in a central bank report known as the 
beige book offered a contrast wednesday with the bit of 
optimism generated a day earlier by a separate report 
the commerce department had reported that the economy as 
measured by the gross national product grew a 
strongerthanexpected 18 percent in the julyseptember quarter 
however the federal reserve said a survey of its 12 district 
banks found that higher oil prices are shaking the confidence of 
consumers and businesses in much of the country 
most districts reported that retailers were generally 
pessimistic they blamed lower consumer confidence brought on 
by greater uncertainty and higher fuel prices the central bank 
reported 
district federal reserve banks said economic activity was 
holding up relatively well in the midwest and northwest but the 
boston district reported manufacturers are battening down the 
hatches 
the report based on information collected through oct 19 was 
prepared for the nov 13 meeting of the federal open market 
committee which sets the feds monetary policy 
in response to enactment of the budget deficitreduction 
package the central bank on monday lowered a key interest rate 
the one charged among banks for overnight loans by a quarter of a 
percentage point to 775 percent 
however economists believe fed policymakers will be reluctant 
to cut the rate again soon for fear of further weakening the value 
of the dollar or adding to inflation pressures already boosted by 
higher oil prices 
the beige book shows the process of gradually slipping 
into a recession but the tone wasnt urgent enough to cause the 
fed to ease policy right away said economist david jones of 
aubrey g lanston amp co a government securities dealer in new 
york 
the survey found pessimism even in relatively strong regions 
the san francisco district for instance said 67 percent of the 
areas business leaders expect a national recession next year 
several districts reported that some financial institutions 
had tightened their lending standards especially for real estate 
loans because of uncertain economic prospects the report said 
in a sign of slipping confidence in the banking system the 
philadelphia federal reserve bank said institutional investors 
pension funds insurance companies universities and the like 
were less interested in depositing uninsured funds with banks 
most areas reported some fallout from oil prices which rocketed 
after iraqs invasion of kuwait in august the st louis regional 
bank said fuel prices caused airline layoffs and contributed to the 
cancellation of expansion plans by a trucking firm 
the san francisco region said one of its respondents reported 
the addition of a fuel surcharge to shipment costs and the dallas 
district said food processors were raising their prices to cover 
increased transportation costs 
on the positive side the dallas district said orders for oil 
field machinery were up applications for oil well permits have 
risen in both texas and louisiana it said 
the other bright spot in the report was agriculture yields of 
most crops were expected to be good the minneapolis and kansas 
city districts reported that higher livestock prices and low feed 
costs were helping to support farm income

farm production costs are rising at the 
fastest clip in eight years because of higher oil prices caused by 
the mideast crisis according to the agriculture department 
the surge in costs of producing crops and livestock is expected 
to bite into farmers income prospects in 1991 
new quarterly figures through october showed farm expenses 
jumped an average of 22 percent from july when such figures were 
last available the expense index was up 56 percent from october 
1989 
a sharp rise in fuel prices since july contributed most to the 
largest quarterly index increase since january 1982 said a 
report released wednesday 
the monthly report by the departments agricultural statistics 
board said prices farmers get for raw products declined 07 percent 
from september to october but still averaged 14 percent more than 
a year ago 
decreases in the prices of broilers milk corn and apples 
were partially offset by higher prices for hogs tomatoes 
strawberries and eggs the board said in its preliminary report 
prices of most food and feed grains were down from september 
although higher prices were reported for oats rice and durum 
wheat soybean and sunflower prices declined while peanut prices 
increased 
the october allhog price increased moderately over september 
while the allcattle price was up slightly the report said 
prices of steers and heifers sold as beef were at a record high 
for october the report said but broiler prices dropped sharply 
from september partly due to large supplies and weaker seasonal 
demand 
usda economists say consumer food prices will rise an average of 
5 percent to 7 percent this year compared with a 58 percent gain 
in 1989 the most since 1981 there has been no official forecast 
for 1991 
the net cash income of farmers in 1990 has been forecast at a 
record in the range of 59 billion to 63 billion up about 10 
percent from last year the previous high was 572 billion in 
1988 
net cash income is the amount nationally that farmers have left 
from gross cash income in a calendar year after deducting cash 
expenses it includes government payments and proceeds from crops 
grown previously but sold during the year 
in another method of agency accounting which includes changes 
in inventories depreciation and other allowances during the year 
1990 net farm income may be in the range of 47 billion to 52 
billion compared with 47 billion last year 
the agriculture departments first 1991 forecasts for food 
prices and farm income are scheduled to be released during an 
annual outlook conference here in late november 
based on preliminary figures that could be revised next month 
the october price index for all crops was down 16 percent from 
september and averaged 47 percent less than a year earlier 
the october index for livestock and products was down 12 
percent from september but still averaged 56 percent more than in 
october 1989 
milk prices reflecting steppedup production dropped 60 cents 
from september to an october average of 1360 per 100 pounds the 
october price was down 120 from a year earlier 
the allfruit price index in october was down 64 percent from 
september and 87 percent the october 1989 average lower prices 
for apples oranges and grapefruit were mostly responsible for the 
decline from september 
the report also said 
cattle averaged 7510 per 100 pounds of live weight 
nationally up 10 cents from september a year earlier cattle 
averaged 6870 per hundredweight those are averages for all types 
of cattle sold as beef 
hogs averaged 5690 per hundredweight up from 5430 in 
september and 4660 a year earlier 
corn at 215 per bushel was down from 232 in september and 
222 a year earlier 
wheat prices at the farm according to preliminary figures 
averaged 239 per bushel compared with 246 in september and 
375 in october 1989 
rice averaged 634 per 100 pounds against 625 in september 
and 737 a year earlier 
soybeans were 590 per bushel compared with 599 in 
september and 554 in october 1989 
upland cotton was reported at 669 cents per pound compared 
with 65 cents in september and 658 cents a year earlier 
eggs were 735 cents per dozen compared with 685 cents in 
september and 716 cents a year earlier 
milk was 1360 per hundredweight against 1420 in september 
and 1480 in october 1989

its not as easy as it used to be but its 
still possible to make 200000 a year and avoid paying any federal 
income tax 
in fact 472 couples and individuals with incomes averaging 
447000 zeroed out on returns filed in 1988 the internal 
revenue service says that was down from 595 who paid no tax the 
previous year 
in a report released wednesday the irs said 557848 returns 
showed income of 200000 or better making those people among the 
highestearning 05 percent in addition to those who paid no tax 
9300 highincome people paid less than 5 percent while 17082 paid 
under 10 percent about the same as paid by the average 
35000ayear family 
the report required annually by congress said 149 of the 472 
used itemized deductions to wipe out their tax liability others 
relied on losses from farm business and partnership operations 
in contrast only 76 of the welltodo who paid no taxes 
reported losses on the sale of investments those capital losses 
averaged only 2600 the irs said 273 reported capital gains 
profits from investment sales that averaged more than 384000 
the analysis is based on raw tax returns irs audits could 
result in assessments that would move some of the couples and 
individuals out of the nontaxpaying category 
the report said a special levy called the alternative minimum 
tax made taxpayers out of 3396 highincome people who otherwise 
would have gotten off scotfree 
this levy designed to ensure that high earners pay some tax 
regardless of how many legitimate deductions they have hit 35223 
people in the over200000 group for a total of 1 billion 
however the alternative tax does not apply in all cases 
because capital gains now are taxed in the same fashion as 
ordinary income eliminating capital gains as a taxavoidance 
device the take from the minimum tax was down sharply compared 
with returns filed in 1987 for that year the minimum tax produced 
48 billion from 158903 highincome filers 
under orders from congress the irs has been reporting the tax 
situation of upperincome americans since 1977 in that year there 
were 53 returns reporting income of 200000 or more while paying 
no taxes 
although the law has been changed several times in an effort to 
prevent the welltodo from shielding their income the figure grew 
to 613 on returns filed in 1986 analysts say antitaxshelter 
rules enacted in 1986 will continue to reduce the number 
through the years the number of taxfree rich people has been 
only a tiny fraction of the wealthy the new irs report showed the 
557848 taxpayers in the 200000andover group paid a total 727 
billion an average of 130276 apiece 
here are some of the income and deduction items reported by the 
472 who paid no tax 
381 claimed itemized deductions totaling 161 million an 
average 423000 
179 claimed business losses totaling 22 million while 71 
listed business profits of 14 million 
farm losses of 12 million were reported on 29 returns only 
four reported farm profits totaling 137000 
partnership losses of 123 million were shown on 256 untaxed 
returns on the other hand 73 reported partnership profits of 23 
million 
436 received interest totaling 95 million more than half of 
that was from taxexempt investments 
322 had dividends totaling 29 million 
only 40 reported receiving pension payments worth under 2 
million 
55 had taxable social security benefits worth 305000 
alimony receipts were reported on only one return they totaled 
8000 
deductions for interest paid averaged 135000 for medical 
expenses 186000 for casualty losses 405000 for state and 
local taxes 33000 for charitable contributions 87000 
nearly 2700 people with income over 200000 received 
unemployment compensation during the year two of them paid no tax

war in the persian gulf would send a shock 
wave through world oil markets aimed directly at the wallets of 
consumers petroleum industry officials say 
the day the war starts prices will explode john lichtblau 
of the petroleum industry research foundation told the senate 
governmental affairs committee on wednesday and there is no 
limit to how high prices could ise short of quickly winning a 
war against iraq he added there is little the united states could 
do to control prices 
oil prices hovering in the 33 per barrel range could easily 
triple said professor fariborz ghadar of george washington 
universitys business school i would not be surprised if oil 
prices reached 100 per barrel he said 
translating a crude oil price increase into a higher price at 
the pump is an inexact science but some industry experts use a 
ratio of 12 cents more per gallon for every 5 increase in the 
price of crude 
at 100 per barrel under that formula gasoline could rise to 
nearly 3 per gallon at the pump 
the reasons for the sharp price rise the experts said would be 
fear that war would disrupt supply lines combined with the 
likelihood that a gulf war would curtail saudi arabias 
oilproducing capabilities 
with oil production already at or near capacity oilconsuming 
states could do little beyond release oil reserves onto the market 
the witnesses said 
conversely they said if iraqi president saddam hussein 
suddenly ends the crisis by withdrawing his forces from kuwait the 
price of oil could drop just as suddenly to levels below those that 
preceded the aug 2 invasion 
that range is likely to be reached approximately 48 hours 
after the crisis is over lichtblau said 
if the stalemate continues it is likely that oil prices will 
remain about where they are the witnesses said but they could 
jump quickly with any disruption of a supply system already 
straining to meet demand 
this is a very tight market ghadar said a pipe blowing 
up in nigeria a fire in venezuela some other disruption could 
be enough to spread panic and push prices higher 
the witnesses said there was little the united states could do 
to break up the oil cartel and that meantime the simple laws of 
supply and demand would govern the price of oil 
witnesses rejected as unworkable for example a suggestion by 
sen joseph lieberman dconn that saudi arabia unilaterally 
lower the price of its crude in exchange for us military support 
the market would quickly absorb the cheap saudi oil and no other 
countries would be compelled to lower their prices lichtblau said 
the best the united states could hope for is more money from 
saudi arabia to help pay the cost of operation desert shield he 
said

nine environmental and consumer groups are 
launching a campaign to convince americans that detroit automakers 
not saddam hussein are the reason us troops are in the middle 
east 
the coalition for fuel efficient transportation is asking 
newspapers television and radio stations to run free commercials 
with the message that the united states is on the brink of war over 
oil 
this is detroits war not the publics war jeremy rifkin 
president of a group called the center for sustainable 
transportation said wednesday if we begin conserving energy at 
home we wont have to risk american lives in the middle east 
the coalition will sponsor advertisements in major newspapers 
beginning with a 25000 halfpage ad in friday editions of the new 
york times rifkin said it is asking radio and tv stations to run 
its commercials as publicservice announcements and some already 
have done so he said 
the campaign is designed to rekindle the battle over automobile 
fuel efficiency rifkin said it faded in september when opponents 
beat back efforts to force a senate vote on a bill sponsored by 
sen richard bryan dnev to require new cars to average 40 miles 
per gallon by the turn of the century 
the commercials urge congress and the bush administration to 
raise government fuel efficiency standards and boost the federal 
tax on gasguzzling automobiles 
us oil imports have risen over the past 15 years although fuel 
efficiency has improved 100 percent said tom hanna president of 
the motor vehicle manufacturers association 
casting this business in the middle east as a failure of us 
energy policy is a rather meanspirited interpretation of the 
presidents actions he said 
in addition to rifkins groups members of the coalition include 
the us public interest research group the american council for an 
energy efficiency economy the center for auto safety citizen 
action environmental action the national toxics campaign public 
citizen and the safe energy communications council

over the next decade millions more americans 
will be shut out of the health care system unless the federal 
government acts to prevent a national catastrophe two social 
activist groups said 
with the nations health care costs expected to soar from 606 
billion this year to 15 trillion by the turn of the century 
americas quality of life is on the line said robert brandon vice 
president of citizen action 
increasingly health care is becoming a luxury item that fewer 
and fewer individuals and families will be able to afford 
brandon said the already frayed safety net will be in shreds by 
the end of the decade 
a report by citizen action and families usa foundation released 
wednesday projected meteoric rises in health care costs that it 
said would harm american businesses and hurt their competitiveness 
with foreign companies americans too would have to spend larger 
portions of their income on medical care and insurance the report 
said 
weve got to do something to get health care costs under 
control or health care is going to be unaffordable for millions of 
americans said ron pollack executive director of families usa 
foundation 
unless the united states takes bold action now to curb health 
care costs the explosion of health care costs will mean a 
declining standard of health care and a declining standard of 
living he said 
the report does not recommend any specific solutions to the 
problem of rising costs but at a news conference pollack said 
this is a national problem ultimately we need a national 
system 
pollack and brandon blamed the rising costs on a variety of 
factors including insurance companies inefficiencies escalating 
fees for doctors and hospitals and uncoordinated use of expensive 
sophisticated technology 
the report which lists statebystate health care spending 
identified massachusetts as the largest percapita spender there 
state and federal governments residents employers and other 
private sources will pay an estimated 3031 for every man woman 
and child in the state this year

the campaign in a general assembly race is 
sounding more like a sermon filled with hellfire and brimstone 
the democratic incumbent state rep lynn taborsak is under 
attack for proposing legislation earlier this year encouraging 
young people to masturbate to avoid sexually transmitted diseases 
and unwanted pregnancies 
the bible says cast your seed into the belly of a whore rather 
than onto the ground republican candidate alex nahas said 
recently referring to the character onan in the book of genesis 
whose name has become synonymous with masturbation 
it violates every religious principle in the bible said 
nahas who believes sex education should be reserved for the home 
taborsaks measure which was circulated in the house but never 
formally introduced or debated called on young people to practice 
masturbation until they are ready for marriage 
taborsak says she only introduced the measure to derail a 
republican amendment requiring that students be taught abstinence 
from premarital sex as the expected norm

legislation giving the television industry a 
threeyear antitrust exemption to adopt voluntary guidelines on 
violence in programming is awaiting president bushs signature 
the house and senate included the provision in a bill on the 
federal judiciary passed during the waning hours of the 101st 
congress 
bush is expected to sign the measure according to an aide to 
sen paul simon 
the illinois democrat who has been trying to get such 
legislation passed since 1985 has cited studies that show by age 
16 the average american child has seen 200000 acts of violence on 
television including 33000 murders 
simon said the bill could help scale back the atmosphere of 
violence on television 
the american civil liberties union has attacked the bill as 
being a trojan horse that could lead to censorship of tv 
programming 
but simon and the bills house author rep dan glickman 
dkan said the bill merely gives the tv industry an easy way to 
lower the level of violence without losing audiences to 
moreviolent competitors and without violating antitrust laws 
each network is reluctant to take unilateral steps to reduce 
violent programming for fear of slipping in the ratings glickman 
said the bill in no way attempts to dictate programming 
policy 
simons bill had passed the senate and house in previous 
sessions but never had gotten to the presidents desk

atta who also uses the name mahmoud elabed ahmad was placed 
in israeli custody and immediately taken out of the united states

a high school senior accused of selling the 
crack cocaine president bush used as a prop in an antidrug speech 
was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his conviction of three 
counts of selling cocaine 
keith jackson 19 was arrested last september after being lured 
by drug enforcement administration agents to lafayette square 
across the street from the white house 
the dea set up the alleged drug sale in lafayette square to 
dramatize how easy it is to buy drugs in the nations capital 
two juries deadlocked on that charge once in december 1989 and 
again last january but the january jury convicted jackson of three 
counts of distributing drugs in other locations before the 
lafayette square sale including a count of selling crack within 
1000 feet of a school that crime carries an automatic 10year 
sentence 
the same jury acquitted jackson of using a telephone to further 
a narcotics deal 
us district judge stanley sporkin on wednesday told jackson 
who had no prior criminal record that he regretted having to 
impose the sentence of 10 years without parole he urged jackson to 
ask bush for a commutation 
he used you in the sense of making a big drug speech but 
hes a decent man a man of great compassion maybe he can find a 
way to reduce at least some of that sentence said sporkin the 
former cia general counsel appointed to the bench by president 
reagan in 1986 
you have to realize you are on the road to getting into very 
very serious trouble i think youre a nice young man and you have 
a future but i do believe you were out of control for a period of 
time sporkin said

publicity from the bush speech the authorities made an example of

atlantas rapid transit system is beckoning to 
booming suburban gwinnett county but some voters there want to 
derail the expansion because of fears that blacks from the city 
will stream out on buses and trains 
others say they simply dont want to pay for it 
gwinnett county voters decide nov 6 whether to bring the 
metropolitan atlanta rapid transit authority into the county in 
exchange for a 1 percent sales tax 
county commissioner wj dodd said his constituents oppose the 
idea and he predicted it would fail 
one of the worst fears is bringing people out of atlanta the 
minorities he said dodd refused to say where he stands on the 
expansion 
blacks and other minorities make up only 64 percent of 
gwinnetts 355000 residents blacks make up 66 percent of 
atlantas 425000 people 
voters in the northeastern atlanta suburb rejected mass transit 
service in 1971 that same year fulton and dekalb counties which 
make up atlanta became the first in the nation to pay voluntarily 
for a mass transit system 
the sales tax they approved has not kept pace with martas 
expenses though the system in july raised bus and train fares 15 
cents to 1 rather than cut service 
marta the souths first mass transit system now transports 
280000 bus riders and 220000 rail passengers daily the rail line 
stretches in four directions from downtown atlanta to fulton and 
dekalb suburbs and to hartsfield atlanta international airport 
residents of gwinnett county whose population has quintupled 
since 1971 depend on their cars 311000 of them traffic is 
bumpertobumper from gwinnett into downtown atlanta most weekdays 
marta officials estimate mass transit could take 25000 cars off 
the countys roads and ridership in gwinnett could reach 60000 by 
the year 2010 
opponents argue that the masses would finance the expansion but 
that only businesses trying to attract lowwage workers would 
benefit the plans foes have taken their campaign to grocery 
stores and malls handing out ban marta stickers 
supporters of the plan have put up signs on interstate 85 into 
gwinnett county that read gwinnetts future is riding on 
marta radio spots tout the benefits of public transportation 
some people have said they oppose marta because they are 
concerned about crime and a decrease in their property values 
said richard myrick a gwinnett businessman leading the expansion 
effort myrick and others are trying to assure residents that 
public transportation wont ruin their neighborhoods 
if voters approve marta will spend 681 million to extend a 
rail line 108 miles toward gwinnett place mall in duluth the line 
would be completed by 1998 
gwinnett county residents would pay a 1 percent sales tax until 
the year 2032 and a 15 percent sales tax for the next eight years 
until the contract expired in 2040 the current sales tax in 
gwinnett county is 5 percent 
a gwinnett daily news poll last month found that 60 percent of 
voters surveyed opposed the sales tax twentysix percent of the 
500 voters said they would foot the bill the remainder were 
undecided the newspaper gave no margin of error for the poll 
anna roupe said she would vote against the expansion 
the people of gwinnett county cant afford it she said 
as far as im concerned for me its my pocketbook there is no 
other issue 
joe lupton of snellville said there is another issue for county 
residents crime i would hasten to say they fear for their 
lives he said 
gwinnett county commission chairman lillian webb the only 
commissioner who has voiced support for the expansion lamented 
that many people see it as a racial issue 
some of them have said we dont want those people out 
here it upsets me the other races other ethnic groups 
contribute to our cultural diversity she said

eighteenyearold rita roundtree says she wants 
information about abortion if the pregnancy test she took this week 
turns out positive 
but the planned parenthood clinic in her blighted south bronx 
neighborhood wont be able to provide such information either for 
or against abortion if a federal ban on such counseling is upheld 
by the us supreme court 
the clinics medical director dr irving rust is leading a 
battle to overturn the regulation which was enacted under the 
reagan administration in 1988 but has not been enforced pending 
court appeals 
on tuesday the supreme court heard arguments in the case in 
which rust planned parenthood and the city and state are 
challenging the law a decision is expected in july 
a federal judge in new york city and a federal appeals court 
panel upheld the regulation but other federal courts around the 
country have ruled it an unconstitutional infringement on free 
speech 
the law bans abortion counseling at health clinics that receive 
federal funds twentyseven percent of the south bronx clinics 
funds about 450000 a year come from the government 
if the law is upheld said jeannine michael the clinics 
director ms roundtree could neither be counseled for or against 
abortion 
you may have a woman come in and say im here for an 
abortion and you dont accept that on face value she said 
you may find out that in fact she has been coerced into 
having an abortion that she doesnt want 
if she is pregnant ms roundtree said she wants advice about 
getting an abortion 
to me by having a baby would have me get behind said the 
young woman who is looking for a job 
another patient 19yearold sharice jackson said the clinic 
plays a crucial role in the wellbeing of south bronx residents 
without this place i dont think my generation would have any 
other place to go because with the way things are going with 
teenage pregnancies you need a place that you can go to get 
options to know what you can do she said 
the clinic is in one of the countrys poorest communities its 
acres of abandoned and vandalized buildings have become a symbol of 
urban decay most of its residents are black or hispanic eighty 
percent of the students entering the ninth grade in the south bronx 
dont graduate 
for many of the 6000 women and teenagers who visit the clinic 
each year it is their only source for a full range of medical 
services including routine gynecological care prenatal care 
abortion abortion counseling aids testing and baby care 
we have been particularly involved in trying to make sure 
that our clients get as much good care as would a woman getting 
private expensive medical care rust said 
the ban on abortion counseling would put an end to that he 
said he added that many women whose pregnancies threaten their 
lives need to know about the option of abortion 
i get a lot of women who come in with serious medical problems 
anemia diabetes high blood pressure he said sometimes 
they come in with emotional problems and a lot of genetic 
problems

an arab stabbed a jewish man several times in 
the chest in a tel aviv suburb on thursday in a continuing wave of 
violence that began with lasts month temple mount killings 
the 48yearold israeli jew was on his way work when he was 
stabbed near his home in rishon lezion said district police 
spokesman eli maimon he was hospitalized and listed in 
satisfactory condition 
israel army radio said extra police were deployed at nearby 
major junctions to search for the assailant and prevent revenge 
attacks by israelis on arabs 
the attack apparently was the latest in a spate of revenge 
attacks set off by the police response to an oct 8 palestinian 
riot on the temple mount in jerusalem twenty palestinians were 
killed in police gunfire 
since then attacks by both arabs and israelis have left six 
people dead and more than 10 wounded 
after last weeks revenge attacks defense minister moshe arens 
closed off the occupied west bank and gaza strip for four days 
barring palestinians from entering israel

in a few years collegebound students will have 
to give their own answers to some scholastic aptitude test math 
problems instead of picking from multiple choices but theyll be 
able to use a calculator 
those are among changes announced wednesday by the college 
board sponsor of the sat the most widely used college entrance 
exam in the nation 
the revisions the most drastic in the tests 64year history 
also include more emphasis on reading comprehension the revised 
sat called sati will be introduced in 1994 board president 
donald m stewart said 
in addition an optional test known as the satii will be 
phased in starting next year and will include an essay section 
critics who have charged that the test is culturally biased and 
a poor judge of students ability said the changes dont go far 
enough 
its polish its adding new tailfins to the edsel says bob 
schaeffer public education director at fairtest a cambridge 
massbased group critical of the sat the sat should be optional 
and it should be comprehensively overhauled to address its 
problems 
stewart said the revisions were aimed in part at reducing 
students reliance on test coaches the changes will increase the 
sats educational relevance and quality for all collegebound 
students he said 
he denied the changes were prompted by charges that the sat is 
biased particularly against women and minorities 
nothing could be further from the truth stewart said at the 
boards annual meeting in boston the sat has been in almost 
continual evolution it has never been set in concrete 
gregg driben national director of precollege programs for 
stanley kaplan educational center ltd which prepares students for 
standardized tests said professional coaches still will play an 
important role 
the old sat had 85 verbal and 60 math questions sati will have 
75 to 85 verbal and 55 to 60 math questions the new math questions 
requiring students to produce an answer on their own will make up 
about 20 percent of the math section 
sarah stockwell fairtests university tests coordinator said 
letting testtakers use calculators is going to make worse an 
already existing income bias because lowincome students may not 
have access to a calculator 
observers had predicted the essay would be included in the main 
sat but gregory anrig president of the educational testing 
service of princeton nj which administers the test said field 
trials showed an essay would make the exam too long 
the sat first was given to 8040 students in 1926 now about 1 
million collegebound students take it every year 
the 2hour exam currently consists of two multiplechoice 
sections that test verbal and math skills each section is worth 
800 points for a perfect score of 1600 
fairtest and other critics have claimed that the sat tends to 
cover subjects that male and affluent testtakers are more likely 
to be familiar with such as sports and finance whites as a group 
have outperformed minority students and males have fared better 
than females 
in 1988 the national organization for women filed a lawsuit that 
forced the new york state education department to stop using the 
sat exclusively to award state merit scholarships the department 
now uses high school grades as well 
while college board officials have steadfastly denied bias 
allegations a panel of educators the board appointed to evaluate 
sat revisions said the charges frequently stem from deepseated 
concerns that call for a thoughtful remedy or response

an effort to restore caribou to the wilds 
of maine has been pronounced a failure after predators killed many 
of the ungainly reindeer 
the maine caribou project inc announced wednesday that it is 
abandoning its 4yearold effort project officials said they doubt 
they can raise the money needed to transplant enough caribou to 
create a selfsustaining herd 
of the 32 caribou released in maine 25 are confirmed dead 12 
killed by bears and coyotes the rest are unaccounted for but 
biologists believe only two or three are alive and they apparently 
have lost the radio collars used to keep track of them 
four caribou calves also were born in the wild two died of 
unknown causes a bear and bobcat killed the others 
caribou once were so abundant in maines north woods that a city 
was named after the animal but overhunting and disease left the 
north american reindeer extinct in maine more than 80 years ago 
the restoration effort which began with a caribou roundup in a 
remote corner of newfoundland was the second since 1963 
when the lastest caribou releases were planned project leaders 
main worry was the deadly parasite known as brainworm 
the whole black bear thing was something none of the 
biologists considered to be a critical factor in the beginning 
project spokesman richard b anderson said 
i think its possible to restore the caribou to its former 
range he said but you need a lot of animals 
that would take more money that project leaders believe they can 
raise in a weakening economy 
biologists believe theyd need 50 to 100 more caribou to 
succeed but it would cost at least 300000 to capture transport 
and monitor that many animals the project which officially ends 
dec 31 has raised 500000 so far 
we have come to realize that only under an extraordinary set 
of circumstances would it have been possible to complete a project 
of this magnitude without organizational and financial support of 
federal or state wildlife agencies project leaders said in a 
statement 
the projects failure shows money is far better spent to 
conserve maines endangered species today while they still 
exist the statement said 
project leaders said they will share information with officials 
in minnesota wisconsin and idaho where caribou reintroduction 
projects are proposed or under way 
the last caribou from a native maine herd was spotted on 
milehigh mount katahdin in 1908 
in 1963 about two dozen caribou were released in northern 
maines baxter state park all of the animals disappeared because 
of poaching disease predators and natural dispersal biologists 
believe 
in 1986 more than two dozen caribou in newfoundland were shot 
with tranquilizer darts and taken by helicopter and in trucks to 
enclosures at the university of maine in orono 1200 miles away 
biologists kept the nursery herd in orono to breed young 
caribou for eventual releases in maines wilds of the dozen 
released in baxter park in april 1989 only one was known to have 
survived by the end of that year 
but project leaders discovered that caribou were more 
susceptible to brainworm when penned so all 20 animals in the 
breeding herd were released and plans were being made to import up 
to 75 more caribou from newfoundland 
in january however the baxter parks board denied permission 
for a spring release board members criticized the way the project 
had been run

the unordered embargo on trade with 
iraq are biting baghdad every day more and more and should 
force its economy to grind to a halt by midwinter the finnish 
diplomat overseeing the embargo says 
nobody really thought that the sanctions would have a great 
effect in a few weeks marjatta rasi finlands deputy 
ambassador said wednesday she heads the security councils 
committee on sanctions 
i understand that at the beginning of next year they will have 
serious problems ms rasi said its not only food its 
everything 
the functioning of the society will slow down because they 
cannot receive spare parts even though they have taken everything 
they could from kuwait ms rasi said she said iraq had also 
been a great importer of chemicals and that is one great problem 
for them 
ms rasi said the sanctions bite every day more and more 
the food situation is not that bad but the selection is not 
that good she said 
since no other nations are buying iraqi or kuwaiti oil baghdad 
is not earning any foreign exchange the iraqi dinar is almost 
worthless outside the country 
in any event the committee has no desire to starve the iraqi or 
kuwaiti population she added 
the only items that may be sent to iraq under the embargo are 
medicine and medical equipment and in humanitarian circumstances 
food 
on aug 6 the security council ordered a trade and financial 
embargo of iraq and occupied kuwait 
on aug 25 it gave the united states and other naval powers the 
right to enforce the economic embargo against iraq and kuwait by 
halting shipping to those countries 
on sept 13 the council voted to allow humanitarian food aid 
into iraq or kuwait only to relieve human suffering and said 
only the council could decide when those circumstances exist 
the council on sept 24 stressed that only its sanctions 
committee has the power to permit food medicine or other 
humanitarian aid to be sent into iraq or occupied kuwait 
the following day the council explicitly expanded its economic 
embargo to include all air traffic in or out of iraq and kuwait 
except for cargos of humanitarian aid specifically authorized by 
its sanctions committee

amnesty international said today that britain has 
refused entry to asylumseekers who risk being returned to 
countries where they could face imprisonment torture and death 
a report by the londonbased human rights group said britains 
refugeedetermination system fails to uphold its obligations under 
the un convention on refugees 
as many as 100 and possibly many more persons seeking asylum 
in the united kingdom have been summarily and unlawfully expelled 
without a proper examination of their asylum claim the 42page 
report said without giving a specific number or time frame 
in addition an untold number of wouldbe asylum seekers have 
been prevented from gaining access to the united kingdoms 
refugeedetermination process it added 
the home office in charge of immigration said the report 
failed to recognize that most asylumseekers were not fleeing 
political persecution under the terms of the 1951 un convention 
it said unfounded asylum claims were now widespread as a means 
of circumventing normal immigration controls and that britain has 
been flooded with applications in recent years 
the amnesty report charged that britain gives insufficient 
advice to asylumseekers and that officials subject them to 
arbitrary and prolonged detention while their cases are being 
considered 
it said most of those who arrive saying they are seeking asylum 
have no right of appeal when refused it 
it said visa requirements and fines on airlines that arrive with 
foreign passengers who dont have proper travel documents have 
combined to obstruct bona fide asylumseekers from gaining 
effective access to britains refugeedetermination system 
the home office statement said refugeedetermination systems 
throughout europe and north america are overwhelmed by unfounded 
claims and that backlogs in the two regions have doubled to more 
than 400000 cases since 1985 
it said that in britain applications for asylum have risen 
fivefold since 1988 and have reached more than 20000 in the past 
12 months it said backlogged applications in britain now number 
27000

prayer warriors

civic center auditorium the site of a christian crusade organized 
by evangelists who say the city is plagued by immoral homosexuals 
crime witchcraft and general sin 
the protesters who contended the meeting was an attack on 
homosexuality shouted profanities waved insulting signs 
shrieked chanted and blocked buses bringing the crusaders from 
some 250 northern california churches 
they put up a 12foot paper penis in the form of a cross in 
front of barricades 
were queer were here get used to it they yelled 
the demonstrators were held back by dozens of police in riot 
gear at one point police had to reach in and pull crusade 
participants through the crowd and into the auditorium where they 
and and their belongings were searched 
the shrieking got so loud that officers put their hands over 
their ears 
the confrontation ended two hours after it started when the 
demonstrators matched to the mainly gay castro district where the 
citys typically outrageous halloween festivities drew more than 
150000 people many in drag 
this is just good clean fun for us a celebration of our

a joyful frenzy the 39yearold lea ordered spirit of 
rejection begone from this area 
lea who distributes prayer army dog tags and has donned 
military fatigues in previous crusades said halloween was selected 
to launch his assault on sin because according to legend demons

this is not just kids having fun he said there is actual 
worship of the devil

after sending troops to raid rebellious 
buddhist monasteries the military government has banned 
unauthorized monks groups and threatened offenders with up to 
three years imprisonment 
the prime minister gen saw maung issued a decree on wednesday 
banning all groups except those formed under the auspices of the 
main buddhist governing body the central sangha 
offenders faced six months to three years in prison according 
to the decree which was carried by the official radio rangoon 
wednesday 
the central sangha was formed in 1980 by a previous 
militarybacked government to regulate the clergy in the 
predominately buddhist nation 
the current military government came to power in crushing a 1988 
national uprising for democracy it has refused to hand over power 
to an opposition party that won may general elections and instead 
arrested party leaders and other dissidents 
monks began their protest by refusing to minister to soldiers 
after troops in the central city of mandalay broke up a 
demonstration in early august reportedly killing two monks and two 
other people 
on oct 21 saw maung issued a decree giving army commanders 
martial law power to bring monks before military tribunals for 
activities deemed disruptive to buddhism sentences dispensed by 
such tribunals range from a minimum of three years to a maximum of 
death 
the next day troops began raiding monasteries in mandalay to 
break the monks boycott 
political sources in rangoon contacted from bangkok said many 
monks were detained in the raids but it was unclear if the army 
had succeeded in forcing an end to the boycott 
one source speaking on condition of anonymity said it would be 
difficult to break the boycott because groups of monks as large as 
500 had entered into compacts to begin it these vows could be 
undone only if all those who took the vow were reassembled he 
said 
state radio on tuesday quoted the mandalay commander maj gen 
tun kyi as saying registration cards should be issued to all monks 
as soon as possible

a federal judge has lifted an injunction that 
had halted in the milwaukee area a firstinthenation statewide 
program that ties welfare benefits to school attendance 
us district judge terence evans who had suspended the 
learnfare program in july because of administrative errors said 
the state and milwaukee county had agreed to safeguards to prevent 
families benefits from being cut by mistake 
gov tommy g thompson hailed the decision wednesday saying it 
paved the way for the state to proceed with an even more 
effective welfare reform program 
learnfare allows the state to cut a familys welfare benefits if 
a teenager has more than two unexcused absences a month a mother 
of two for instance can lose 77 of her 517 monthly check and 
sometimes more 
learnfares boosters had said it will help break the cycle of 
poverty others have branded it an administrative nightmare but 
proponents insist it works well everywhere but in milwaukee county 
evans issued the injunction july 10 after several welfare 
recipients complained they were sanctioned on the basis of 
inaccurate attendance records 
milwaukee county and the state department of health and social 
services have singe agreed to provide written notices to parents 
and take other steps to very that a student is indeed cutting 
class 
if sanctions are to be imposed the family will be given a 
notice that includes the dates the student was absent 
while the agreement applies only to milwaukee county it could 
be expanded to cover the entire state legal action lawyer patricia 
delessio said 
more than 13000 teenagers are subject to learnfare 
requirements in milwaukee county about 12 percent were penalized 
in june the last month the program operated before its suspension

general motors corp took a record 2 billion 
thirdquarter loss to close four auto plants and stop production at 
several others 
the 2 billion figure was the biggest quarterly loss in 
automotive history but the announcement wednesday was hailed on 
wall street as a signal that gm is serious about cutting costs and 
becoming more competitive 
gm wants to begin the decade of the 90s with a clean slate 
and face the reality of the marketplace said auto analyst scott 
merlis of morgan stanley amp co 
gm said assembly plants in pontiac mich kansas city mo 
atlanta ga and framingham mass that have been idle the past 
three years will close permanently 
the automaker also said it will stop production over the next 
three years at truck plants in scarborough ontario lordstown 
ohio and pontiac mich along with closing or consolidating 
operations of some component plants 
it was not immediately known how many workers would be affected 
gm estimated the closures will cost 21 billion including 
promised payments to laidoff workers that amount was charged 
against 109 million in thirdquarter earnings 
during contract negotiations with the united auto workers last 
summer gm agreed to guarantee the income of workers laid off from 
plants closed because of slumping sales 
gm stock closed wednesday on the new york stock exchange at 
3675 a share up 12 cents an indication that analysts and 
brokers werent worried about the loss 
most charges like this cause the stock to drop sharply 
merlis said 
gm revenue for the third quarter rose to 308 billion compared 
with 288 billion during the same period last year 
the 109 million in earnings that would have been posted without 
the 21 billion charge were down sharply from 5169 million 
during the yearago period 
thirdquarter results reported earlier this week were also 
dismal at ford motor co which posted a smallerthananticipated 
profit of 1017 million and at chrysler corp which lost 214 
million 
there is no question that the quarter is dismal merlis 
said this certainly reflects the further automotive downturn 
induced by the gulf crisis

masked vietnamese wielding homemade spears 
battled teargas firing security personnel today at a camp for boat 
people authorities said at least 16 people were injured including 
three security officers 
the fight at the whitehead detention center broke out in the 
early afternoon as corrections officers conducted a sweep for 
weapons a government spokesman said he said between 40 and 50 
masked boat people were involved 
tensions are on the rise in hong kongs squalid detention 
centers for boat people temporary homes for thousands of 
vietnamese who fled their homeland only to face the likelihood of 
repatriation 
government officials said the three security officers suffered 
cuts and bruises one vietnamese woman was hospitalized and about 
80 homemade spears were seized 
the sweep for weapons followed a fight wednesday night between 
two groups of newly arrived boat people from the haiphong area of 
northern vietnam 
after firing three canisters of tear gas the officers quelled 
the outbreak said the spokesman who cannot be identified under 
briefing rules 
the violence was the latest in a series of skirmishes among boat 
people and between vietnamese and security personnel who patrol the 
camps 
tensions have been rising in the camps following an agreement 
between vietnam britain and the united nations high commissioner 
for refugees to speed the return of vietnamese to their homeland 
the agreement creates a new category of boat people those who 
do not oppose being sent back to vietnam the unhcr already 
supervises a program that returns volunteers to vietnam so far 
4899 have returned voluntarily 
in a major policy change un officials will now be urging 
vietnamese who have no hope of achieving refugee status to return 
home 
many vietnamese in the camps view the new category as a veiled 
way to force people back to vietnam against their will since the 
announcement of the agreement in late september dozens of boat 
people have gone on hunger strike opposing the agreement and the 
unhcr 
one un official described hong kongs camps as a tinderbox 
waiting to catch fire 
unhcrs representative in hong kong robert van leeuwen said 
un officials have gone to great lengths to convince the boat 
people that the un has not agreed to forcible repatriation 
today he reiterated that point saying his organization cannot 
and will not be associated with forced repatriation 
but the un official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the uns campaign has not convinced many boat people he said 
special phones have been installed in un offices in the camps in 
case of violence adding that un representatives are no longer 
encouraged to move around the camps alone 
he said officials are worried about repeats of violence such as 
an incident in january during which six members of the correctional 
services department were held hostage for six hours in whitehead 
the largest camp in hong kong 
about 54000 boat people who fled communist vietnam currently 
occupy hundreds of tin warehouses and cement cells in the camps 
where crime and other social ills flourish 
of them 45000 arrived after june 1988 when the british 
colonial government instituted a screening program to separate what 
it called legitimate political refugees from economic migrants 
before that all boat people were considered refugees 
under the screening process those who are determined to be 
refugees will be allowed to stay and work in hong kong and await 
resettlement abroad while the economic migrants will be sent home 
so far 15000 of the 45000 have failed the test 
the hong kong government forcibly repatriated 51 of them in 
december but stopped that program after pressure from the united 
states 
the new agreement was borne of efforts by london to convince the 
united states that the vietnamese must be sent home 
in a statement today leeuwen said the unhcr hoped the first 
flight containing the new category of boat people would take off in 
november initially the government planned to send the first group 
back in october but so far interest has been low

alas theyre doubting poor shakespeare 
once more 
this time though two computer whizzes have come to the bards 
defense 
they have developed a program than determined there could be no 
other author of the body of work attributed to william shakespeare 
than shakespeare himself 
armed with their data ward elliott and robert valenza a 
claremont mckenna college computer science professor challenged 
the shakespeare oxford society at the organizations annual meeting 
in pasadena on saturday 
the shakespeare oxford society maintains that shakespeare the 
son of an illiterate craftsman could not have had enough knowledge 
of the places and people to write the plays attributed to him 
society members say edward de vere the 17th earl of oxford was 
more likely to have written them 
the program by elliott and valenza analyzes blocks of text and 
looks for patterns in the way the words are strung together 
shakespeares poems were plotted on a graph as were other poets 
works 
elliott on wednesday said all of shakespeares works are 
similar and those of the earl of oxford look nothing like them 
elliott said he and valenza also ran the poems through more 
traditional tests such as checking for hyphenated words 
exclamation marks certain clauses and word endings 
we gave the results of a halfdozen tests including a new 
test that is not quite as powerful as fingerprints but powerful 
enough to make every poet claimant that we tested an unlikely 
claimant elliott said 
as for the theory that shakespeares work may have been written 
by a number of authors elliott said if his work was written by 
a committee it was an incredibly consistent committee 
some oxfordians dismissed the computer studies as word 
counting and complained they were done by students outside the 
field of literature the program is run largely by economics 
political science and computer science majors 
ruth loyd miller a lawyer and author who has researched the 
question extensively objected that the computer looked at words 
without regard for context 
elliott who is himself a member of the society and whose father 
was an early oxfordian said my conclusion was that the prospect 
for oxford was pretty bleak but there are a few little shrubs for 
cover 
id be surprised to see the group break up over my 
evidence he said

a writer whos been imprisoned repeatedly for 
criticizing authorities is free again after spending 14 months in 
jail for joining the illfated prodemocracy movement and said 
today that hell keep on writing 
but 72yearold wang ruowang who was released monday from a 
shanghai jail refused to say whether he will speak out again for 
the democratic change that came to a halt when the government 
crushed the movement in june 1989 
the prolific writer of essays and literary criticism laughed and 
said thats a good question you can say that basically i have 
studied well all prisoners are advised to study the law and 
party line to avoid future offenses 
in a telephone interview today from his shanghai home wang said 
his case was not closed i still have a tail he said a 
chinese expression that means one remains under a cloud 
wang said he remained under investigation and was still subject 
to official questioning he said he could not leave the city 
without official permission 
still his spirit seems unbroken he laughed frequently during 
the brief conversation and spoke in a strong lively voice 
students and intellectuals demanding democratic reform marched 
and held sitins for several weeks in shanghai and other cities in 
support of last years studentled protests in beijings tiananmen 
square 
the potests ended peacefully in shanghai but troops and tanks 
cleared beijings streets by force on june 4 1989 killing 
hundreds of people 
tens of thousands of people were arrested nationwide and accused 
of counterrevolutionary crimes in connection with the protests the 
government says 355 people are still jailed in beijing and two in 
shanghai but it refuses to give a nationwide figure many like 
wang have not yet been tried 
wangs satiric writings and calls for artistic freedom landed 
him in jail first under the nationalist chinese and later under the 
communists he was expelled from the communist party in 1987 for 
supporting student protests for democratic reform 
when students began protesting again last year wang wrote an 
open letter of support to senior leader deng xiaoping and helped 
lead a march on shanghais city hall 
he was placed under house arrest in july the month after the 
crackdown began and taken away in september 1989 shanghai sources 
said he was not allowed during his imprisonment to communicate with 
his wife and was kept in apart from other prisoners in relatively 
poor conditions 
a writer not using his pen passes his days worse than a jailed 
man the hong kong newspaper ming pao quoted wang as saying 
ming pao quoted wang as saying he lost some teeth and that his 
eyesight weakened but in the telephone interview today he said he 
was basically in good health 
im resting after all im an old man he said 
friends have described wang in the past as tough and defiant by 
nature when expelling him from the party in 1987 communist 
officials gave a similar description but in less flattering terms 
the party organizations patiently criticized and educated him 
on many occasions but he refused to mend his ways he asserted 
that he would fight to the end a shanghai party leader rui 
xingwen said in 1987 
during his imprisonment the shanghai newspaper wen hui bao

an arab stabbed an israeli garage owner 10 
times in the chest and back in a tel aviv suburb today in the 
latest in a wave of palestinian nationalist attacks police said 
shlomo shtezi 48 was stabbed in his automobile workshop in 
rishon lezion by a former employee who had slept in the shop 
overnight israeli army radio said he was in intensive care in a 
nearby hospital 
the victims son kobi said he rushed to the workshop after his 
father called home to say hed been stabbed 
i went in and saw my father lying on top of cartons 
surrounded by blood with stab wounds in his chest the son told 
the radio there were pools of blood all over the workshop and 
near the phone 
the palestinian suspect was caught by soldiers at a military 
roadblock as he was headed to his home in the gaza strip district 
police commander hezi ledder told army radio 
police spokesman eli maimon said investigators classified the 
stabbing as a nationalist crime related to the palestinian 
uprising the assailant was not identified by name 
ledder told army radio that 200 arabs were rounded up following 
the attack in an effort to both find the assailant and prevent 
revenge attacks by israelis they were later released 
the attack was the latest in a spate of revenge attacks set off 
by the police response to an oct 8 riot on jerusalems sacred 
temple mount twenty palestinians were killed by police gunfire 
since then attacks by both arabs and jews have left six dead 
and more than 10 wounded 
after revenge attacks last week defense minister moshe arens 
closed off the occupied west bank and gaza strip for four days 
barring palestinians from entering israel 
on monday arens announced tougher restrictions for palestinians 
to come to israel from the occupied lands saying he would ban all 
those with records of crime or nationalist political activity 
increasing fear of arab attacks by jews was apparent in another 
tel aviv suburb ramat gan when parents blocked their children 
from taking a kindergarten day trip after discovering their bus 
driver was an arab 
the minute i saw the driver i felt uncomfortable one 
mother ronit bracha said on army radio after a few more 
parents saw the same thing we went into the kindergarten and 
said we didnt want our kids driven by an arab 
an incident last may in rishon lezion set off an upsurge in the 
34month palestinian uprising an israeli civilian shot to death 
seven arab laborers in the town after forcing them at gunpoint to 
sit on the ground 
the incident set off protest rioting in the occupied gaza strip 
in which more than a dozen palestinians died in army gunfire 
officials first said the jewish assailant 21yearold ami 
popper was deranged but a panel of psychiatrists later ruled he 
was competent to stand trial his trial has not begun however

iraqi president saddam hussein is more open to a 
peaceful settlement of the persian gulf crisis than he was in early 
october according to a soviet envoy who met with him this week 
yevgeny primakov an aide to presidet mikhail s gorbachev 
told soviet television wednesday night that he detected a shift in 
saddams position on resolving the showdown over iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait 
primakov also said iraq had agreed on a schedule for soviet 
citizens to leave iraq and that 2500 would leave before the end of 
november he said 34 soviet military experts were flying home to 
moscow today 
primakov a middle east specialist and close adviser to 
gorbachev has been shuttling across the region at the soviet 
leaders behest he met with saddam on oct 5 and again on sunday 
he did not elaborate on what the differences were in the iraqi 
leaders views other than to say that saddam on oct 5 insisted 
that kuwait was part of iraqi territory but on sunday did not 
raise that issue 
my impression is that he is more in favor of a political 
settlement although i dont exclude the possibility that it will 
take a long long time to come to this solution primakov said in 
the tv interview 
although the gorbachev envoy said the talks with saddam focused 
mainly on getting the remaining soviet people out of iraq he also 
said that i had instructions from the president to make it clear 
during the talks that it is absolutely necessary to free all 
foreign hostages 
there have been suggestions that saddam might be willing to 
withdraw from kuwait if he is allowed to keep the kuwaiti section 
of an oil field that straddles the iraqkuwait border and two 
strategic islands that would improve iraqs access to the persian 
gulf 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said tuesday 
that there were 4008 soviets in iraq including military 
specialists and civilian contract employees 
primakov said he stressed again to saddam that iraqi troops must 
withdraw from kuwait since iraq invaded kuwait the soviet union 
has backed all un security council resolutions that condemned 
iraq and ordered an embargo on trade with baghdad to force it to 
relinquish the oilrich emirate 
primakovs trip also included stops in the united states saudi 
arabia egypt and syria

reporters scrambling for stories and prosecutors 
trying to prevent news leaks that could jeopardize a trial will 
inevitably clash says attorney general dick thornburgh 
thornburgh told a luncheon session of the 56th annual associated 
press managing editors convention here wednesday that he supports 
the medias right to publish without censorship but he added that 
prosecutors must put an individuals right to a fair trial before 
any other concern 
as much as the defendant has the right to remain silent before 
the court the prosecutor has the obligation to remain silent 
outside the court said thornburgh who has headed the justice 
department since 1988 
prosecutors who leak information on pending criminal cases to 
the media jeopardize not only a persons right to a fair trial but 
also place the judicial systems integrity at risk thornburgh 
said 
his a prosecutor duties do not encompass the exposure of 
suspected criminal activities for exposures sake the attorney 
general told about 400 editors attending the luncheon 
but he added that he appreciates the need for free and effective 
news media 
i share with you an abiding interest in the freedom of the 
press no matter how uncomfortable your copy makes us he said 
in a time of increasing crime a free press is essential 
thornburgh said because the public wants to know if it is 
receiving the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth

when foreigners invest 2 trillion in the 
american economy you might think americans would be thankful since 
that kind of money can make a real difference in living standards 
but theres a drawback some of that money could lower rather 
than raise standards 
a policy report just released by the committee for economic 
development suggests that the good investment money often isnt 
differentiated from the potentially bad money thus confusing 
public debates and discussions 
the better money it says is direct investment in the ownership 
of american businesses and properties because it brings benefits 
in the form of new productive capacity technology knowhow and 
jobs 
the less good and potentially damaging investments are in 
portfolios of stocks bonds and bank deposits liquid investments 
that can be dumped overnight in a crisis thus worsening any 
financial instability 
sudden withrawal of a sizable amount of stock investments for 
example could produce an aberration in the dow jones industrial 
average comparable in in destructiveness to last years san 
francisco earthquake 
to clarify the matter which is one of the most confused topics 
of debate in economic circles the committee issued an explanatory 
booklet titled what does it signal appropriately followed by 
three question marks 
claudia feurey vice president said one goal of the corporate 
executives and academics who make up the ced is to clear up 
misconceptions about foreign debt especially the difference 
between direct and portfolio investments 
direct investments in the form of real estate or plant 
purchases imply a longterm commitment to the us economy and a 
significant portion of earnings are reinvested within the country 
these are relatively stable investments 
they arent altogether without potential drawbacks among them 
national security some critics fear also that foreign companies 
might lower wages or weaken their us subsidiary but the ced 
found no such evidence 
their concern was reserved primarily for portfolio investments 
by far the larger of the two types of foreign investment direct 
investment accounts for a mere 500 billion portfolios for a 
giant 17 trillion 
not only are such investments unstable they also are expensive 
to americans indirect portfolio investments often represent us 
debt private and public held abroad interest on it typically is 
sent abroad 
paying interest generally is a burden but it becomes more so 
when the payment is spent elsewhere rather than reinvested locally 
if it is used to lower the foreign exchange rate of the dollar 
american living standards fall 
the ced finds still another reason to worry about the level of 
portfolio investments by foreigners those investments it says 
seems to end up financing american consumption rather than 
production of goods and services 
but dont blame the foreigners for this drawback the reason 
their money isnt used for greater american production is because 
of americas avaricious appetite for borrowing money in order to 
consume its americas fault 
this problem says the report is a direct result of national 
economic policies and attitudes if americans curtailed government 
and private borrowing for consumption foreign capital could 
instead finance productive investment 
for example it cites the push given the us economy in the 
19th century when british capital was used to help build 
railroads as a result jobs were created efficiency of transport 
increased and transportation costs fell 
moreover the opening of the relatively undeveloped parts of the 
continent produced economic benefits that can hardly be calculated 
in terms of return on investment foreign capital helped make the 
united states a powerhouse 
the more precise question therefore may not be whether foreign 
capital is good or bad an asset or a drawback the ceds view is 
that it is both and that for our own sake we had better get it 
clear

an organizer who walked the streets with other 
volunteers to deter arsonists on devils night detroits annual 
halloween eve fire spree said children took over the streets the 
next night to look for treats 
the streets are overflowing with children thats unusual 
ray wright said wednesday 
but maybe all the positive feedback about the patrols keeping 
down the trouble convinced the parents they could go out with the 
kids tonight unlike other years 
devils night arsonists set scattered fires that gutted vacant 
buildings and spread to occupied homes tuesday night on detroits 
east side but neighborhood watch groups kept vandalism down 
elsewhere in the city 
firefighters and thousands of blockwatchers remained on guard 
for the tail end of the fire spree wednesday night few fires were 
spotted by reporters driving around the fogshrouded city or 
reported by citizen patrol groups 
city officials have not yet released fire statistics mayor 
coleman young said a news conference would be scheduled today or 
friday to announce the number of fires 
officer allene ray said children poured into neighborhood police 
stations throughout the city to have their candy examined 
the children are coming in in large numbers to get their 
goodies okd she said i can only hope its because their 
parents feel safer this year its nice to see the kids in their 
costumes 
last year the mayors office reported 223 fires oct 2931 115 
of those on devils night the firefighters union however said 
there were more than 400 fires 
the worst devils night was in 1984 when 810 fires were set 
during the threeday rampage dozens of families were left 
homeless 
police arrested 154 youths monday night and 91 tuesday night for 
violating 6 pm to 6 am curfews imposed for oct 2931 to quash 
devils night by midnight wednesday 330 curfew violators had been 
arrested 
police reported 379 curfew violations over the threenight 
period last year

subtle menstrualcycle disturbances in women who 
have outwardly regular monthly periods could be an important 
underlying cause of bone loss that leads to fractures later in 
life a study today concludes 
the hormones estrogen and progesterone are essential for 
building and keeping strong bones and their release in the body 
follows the menstrual cycle 
doctors have long known that women who miss periods entirely 
such as those who exercise strenuously or dont eat enough risk 
weakening their bones 
but the new research suggests that far less obvious disturbances 
in the monthly cycle also are bad for the bones 
the study conducted at the university of british columbia 
shows that women who do not ovulate or release an egg every cycle 
lose 4 ercent of the bone in their spines annually even though 
they menstruate as usual 
jerilynn c prior who directed the study said stress and being 
too thin may disrupt ovulation and women who regularly miss 
ovulation may need to take progesterone supplements to preserve 
their bones 
women can have menstrual cycles that are regular in length and 
flow but still not ovulate in such cycles women produce normal 
amounts of estrogen but less than usual progesterone 
some premenstrual symptoms may accompany ovulation prior said 
women can keep track of their ovulation by checking themselves for 
mild breast tenderness which is a regular sign of the eggs 
release 
in the study published in the new england journal of medicine 
doctors monitored the menstrual periods of 66 women ages 21 to 42 
onethird were runners preparing for a marathon onethird were 
recreational runners and the rest were normally active nonrunners 
the doctors expected to see more menstrual disruptions in the 
marathoners instead they found that all the women had normal 
cycles 97 percent of the time and ovulation disturbances occurred 
in 29 percent of their cycles but the disturbances were no more 
common in the avid runners 
these results suggest that the maintenance of peak bone 
density throughout adulthood requires normal ovarian production of 
both estrogen and progesterone the researchers wrote 
however since the study was conducted on a small carefully 
selected group it is unclear whether ovulatory disturbances are 
anywhere near as common in the general population 
in an accompanying editorial drs c conrad johnston jr of 
indiana university and christopher longcope of the university of 
massachusetts suggested that the bone loss cited in the study had 
been overestimated 
if such loss were to continue these women would have very low 
spinal bone mass at the time of their menopause they wrote much 
lower than is typically seen 
however prior said she believes a lifetime of irregular 
ovulation may be to blame for many of the fractures that occur in 
women soon after menopause 
highly conditioned athletes frequently stop menstruating 
entirely and are at high risk of losing bone and increasing their 
risk of fractures 
dr deborah riester of new england medical center in boston who 
is looking for treatments for these women said she sees women in 
their 20s who have the bones of 50yearolds 
they think they are so healthy she said but they are 
going to run into a lot of problems with fractures 
riester said women who take birth control pills which cease 
ovulation are not more susceptible to bone loss because the pills 
contain hormones

police imposed curfews and 
other restrictions today on three violencewracked black areas near 
cape town but lifted similar measures in 11 townships outside 
johannesburg 
also president fw de klerk held talks today with mangosuthu 
buthelezi leader of the inkatha freedom party on plans for 
launching negotiations to end apartheid 
de klerk wants to begin talks next year with black opposition 
groups including inkatha and the african national congress led by 
nelson mandela faction fighting between the anc and inkatha has 
slowed efforts to begin negotiations 
law and order minister adriaan vlok said late wednesday that 
recent violence had made it necessary to introduce extraordinary 
measures in three townships outside cape town khayelitsha 
crossroads and lingulethu 
volk said township residents planned more protests and work 
boycotts but that police would use their expanded powers to 
prevent unrest 
a 9 pm to 4 am curfew went into effect today in the three 
townships which are home to hundreds of thousands of blacks 
the measures announced by vlok give police additional powers to 
restrict demonstrations and other forms of protest they are not as 
severe as measures imposed under a fouryear nationwide state of 
emergency that was lifted in june 
the cape town townships had been relatively peaceful until two 
weeks ago 
the recent conflict has been between antiapartheid groups and 
local town councilors many antiapartheid militants see the black 
councilors as collaborators with the whiteled national government 
more than 800 blacks have died in factional fighting outside 
johannesburg since august the violence eased in october and vlok 
said restrictions had been lifted in 11 townships east of 
johannesburg 
several johannesburgarea townships remain restricted unrest 
areas including soweto where fighting sunday left 17 people 
dead and more than 30 injured 
most of the battles around johannesburg have pitted zulus loyal 
to the conservative inkatha freedom party against other blacks who 
support the anc 
the anc and inkatha are the two largest black opposition 
movements and both oppose apartheid but they differ over tactics 
and plans for a future south africa 
also today police announced the arrests of five white men 
believed linked to rightwing organizations the men have not been 
charged but are being investigated for the possession of illegal 
weapons and possible ties to the recent violence the independent 
south african press association reported

patricia hale hasnt heard anything of her husband since aug 
24 so she welcomes saddam husseins promise to release videotaped 
messages from american hostages held in iraq 
but that offer and an open invitation to hostage families who 
wish to spend the christmas and new years holidays with loved 
ones does little to appease the spring texas woman 
with a situation this bad its hard to say what makes you 
feel better of course i want to see ed and make sure hes fine 
mrs hale said but feeling better for me will be when i see him 
getting off a plane 
with each day winter draws nearer and mrs hale grows angrier 
her husband ed was wearing a shortsleeved shirt when invading 
iraqi troops removed him from an oil rig on aug 2 now the desert 
winters unforgiving cold approaches 
we dont want our husbands over there without proper food and 
clothing mrs hale said wednesday if theres a way my 
government can help alleviate that problem and they refuse to do 
it well i find that totally unacceptable 
hostage families said their minds were little eased by saddams 
latest offers which came a day after freed french hostages widely 
criticized the conditions american hostages were facing 
its probably just another psychological ploy said dawn 
bazner whose husband was videotaped early in the crisis asking 
saddam to let foreign women and children go im hoping that we 
wont have to visit my husband there but if it comes down to 
it i will go 
some of the hostages are probably being treated fine and sure 
theyll videotape them said betty seago of johnson city tenn 
iraqi troops captured her husband an oil worker and three other 
americans during an escape attempt 
but she asked but what about the ones that arent being 
treated fine 
the families of many hostages held in iraq and kuwait have 
repeatedly called the kuwaiti task force at the state department in 
recent weeks to express concerns about the conditions under which 
their loved ones are living 
we are looking into the possiblilty of sending packages to our 
embassy in baghdad to be forwarded to the iraqi government which 
would then hopefully forward them to the hostages said diane 
salisbury a state department spokeswoman 
similar attempts have been made to get letters to hostages but 
ms salisbury said the process was complicated and the results 
unclear she also said it was not necessarily possible or advisable 
to make contact with americans in hiding 
in any case she said we are holding the iraqis 
accountable for taking care of the hostages whether or not they 
receive packages from home 
donnita cole isnt willing to leave the situation up to the 
iraqis the odessa texas woman has been on the phone to 
washington dc daily for more than three weeks pressing for a 
way to get her husband the clothes he needs 
at this point in the game i dont care whose responsibility it 
is said mrs cole who on tuesday heard from a freed french 
hostage who spent much of his captivity with 50yearold john cole 
the frenchmans words to me were please please tell your 
government it must get their men some coldweather clothes she 
said ive got to help john when thetemperature starts falling 
out there i want him to have a pair of socks on 
like mrs cole and many other oil workers wives mrs hale has 
experienced the middle easts frigid winters during stints living 
abroad with her husband an oil worker with oge drilling inc 
i think a lot of americans have some misconceptions about the 
desert climate mrs hale said they think about sand and the 
sun burning all the time 
but theres no place colder than the desert at night said 
mrs cole who has become fast friends with mrs hale since the 
crisis began 
mrs cole said that in his telephone call tuesday the freed 
french hostage also warned her husband and other americans were not 
getting adequate nutrition 
freed foreigners have repeatedly warned of dwindling food 
supplies but ms salisbury said such reports were impossible to 
confirm 
we do think sanctions have taken some effect she said 
how much food is getting to people however is difficult to 
assess 
hostage families say they have grown increasingly impatient with 
the occasional letter and secondhand reports that have emerged 
with hostages most recently about 300 french citizens freed by 
saddam hussein 
president bush echoed the hostage families concerns while on a 
campaign stop wednesday in alexandria va where he declared do 
you think im concerned about it youre darn right i am i have 
had it 
margaret williams whose son and daughterinlaw are among 
saddams human shields has also begun to run out of patience 
simple daily rituals grow more difficult each day 
she sets the dinner table and recalls a monthold letter 
smuggled out of iraq in which her son says food is growing scarce 
she pulls an electric blanket down from the closet and thinks of 
the desert winter 
its awfully hard to do these things when you know your kids 
are suffering mrs williams said wednesday from germantown 
tenn weve just got to help these people out

a former chief of the us food and drug 
adminstrations generic drug division has been convicted of lying 
to fda investigators and a congressional subcommittee 
marvin seife 66 was found guilty wednesday of two counts of 
perjury for denying he accepted meals from generic drug company 
executives 
seife who is retired faces up to 10 years in prison and 
500000 in fines he is free on bond pending sentencing scheduled 
by us district judge john r hargrove for jan 23 
seife who headed the generic drug division for 18 years was 
the 15th person convicted in the investigation of alleged bribery 
and fraud in the generic drug industry 
also convicted were fda chemists and others of seifes 
subordinates who admitted accepting thousands of dollars in illegal 
gratuities several companies have admitted giving the gratuities 
to officials of the rockville mdbased federal agency 
assistant us attorney geoffrey r garinther said seife set 
the tone for and presided over an unprecedented level of 
mismanagement and corruption that almost brought down the generic 
drug industry 
but seifes defense presented him as a champion of generic drugs 
and the small companies that struggled to get their cheaper 
versions of brandname drugs onto the market for elderly and 
lowincome consumers 
by befriending generic drug executives and occasionally having 
meals with them seife said i felt i was giving them the 
necessary encouragement to gain acceptance 
seife acknowledged at least 14 meals prosecutors documented in 
court but said he had forgotten about them he said his memory was 
fading because he was heavily sedated with aspirin for arthritis 
pain 
seifes lawyer hamilton p fox said he is considering an 
appeal

two american hostages in letters released 
today by a us official described life in the iraqi gulag as 
a nightmare of fear and uncertainty 
the americans were among thousands of foreigners trapped by 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait many have since been released 
including hundreds of western women and children and this week 
french nationals 
the official said the handwritten letters were brought to the 
us embassy in baghdad by other nonamerican foreigners the 
identity of the letters authors was not disclosed for security 
reasons and the official also demanded anonymity 
i have been in the iraqi gulag system for almost two months 
we are virtually prisoners in iraq wrote one of the americans 
another being held as a human shield at a different iraqi 
installation described his isolation 
i have been moved five times not heard from anyone since aug 
16 except for a message from my wife on voa voice of america on 
oct5 he wrote we are getting no mail or messages at all 
the writer added tell my wife i love her and i have lost 35 
pounds 
the other american letterwriter compared the conditions of his 
captivity to a jail 
no telephone calls to anyone facilities very much like a 
mediumsecurity prison in the united states bars on windows doors 
locked 
the hostage said the windows were not barred but about half a 
dozen iraqis lived in an adjoining room and guards with automatic 
rifles guarded the facility at night 
you can survive but individually interned one must be 
psychologically capable of living alone within himself the 
letter said it ended with a plea please do not forget the guest 
hostages 
iraq calls the detained foreigners guests 
iraqi officials have denied reports they are mistreating the 
foreigners calling such claims falsehoods that could be used as a 
pretext for a us attack 
diplomats in kuwait and other foreigners are welltreated and 
all receive good care an information ministry spokesman said 
wednesday 
the spokesman commenting on condition of anonymity also said 
iraq is prepared to allow the families of foreign hostages to visit 
over the christmas and new years holiday 
the proposal appeared to be part of an overall iraqi offer to 
relatives of its foreign guests several britons have already 
visited captives including wives visiting their husbands being 
held in iraq 
one western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the iraqi offer of holiday visits boded ill for the captives 
thats bad news said the diplomat speaking on condition of 
anonymity that means they will be here until the new year if not 
later 
president bush said wednesday that his patience was running out 
with iraqs treatment of us diplomats in kuwait the only western 
embassies that have not shut down in kuwait city belong to the 
americans and british iraqs pressure tactics have forced all the 
others to close 
our people inside are being starved by a brutal dictator 
bush said and do you think im concerned about it youre darn 
right i am 
information minister latif jassim said it was possible the 
united states was spreading false reports on conditions of 
foreign guests to seek an excuse to attack iraq 
i want to tell you that our guests live in good conditions at

an escape artist who modeled himself after 
harry houdini died in a halloween stunt when tons of dirt and wet 
cement collapsed the coffin in which he had locked himself 
joseph w burrus 32 who billed himself as amazing joe 
died at 930 pm wednesday at blackbeards family fun center said 
police lt roger enmark the exact cause of death was not

frantically dug at the dirt and cement to try to rescue burrus from 
the artificial grave 
they attempted to get him out but it did no good enmark 
said 
before the stunt burrus said he considered himself a successor 
to the great escape artist houdini who died oct 31 1926 
i consider myself a master of illusion and an escape artist i 
believe i am the next houdini and greater burrus said to me 
that is what an escape artist is to put myself in an impossible 
situation and get out of it 
burrus volunteered to do the stunt to benefit the third floor a 
drug rehabilitation program said program manager charles lewis 
he told me he had perfected this act and said he was a 
recovering addict and wanted to do this show as a benefit lewis 
said 
burrus was handcuffed wrapped in chains locked inside the 
coffin lowered into a 7footdeep grave and buried 
aides had lowered the coffin halfway when burrus knocked on the 
sides to tell them the chains were choking him said assistant sean 
henderson 
they opened the casket so burrus could loosen a chain around his 
neck then locked it again he knocked on the side and gave two 
thumbs up and told us to continue henderson said 
aides shoveled about three feet of dirt into the hole a cement 
truck poured another three feet of wet cement into the grave 
as soon as we finished and the truck pulled away the whole 
thing dropped the cement busted the coffin it buried him alive

women and black candidates are fighting to 
change the political landscape in highprofile races that could see 
them take over three governorships and several seats in congress 
national attention is focused on black candidate harvey gantts 
strong bid to unseat sen jesse helms rnc and the bigstate 
gubernatorial candidacies of ann richards in texas and dianne 
feinstein in california 
a raft of women and blacks are seeking office at the 
congressional and state levels 
womens groups are pleased with the number of female candidates 
seeking statewide office in tuesdays election 85 in all 
according to the center for the american woman and politics 
there are eight women running for governor and 19 for lieutenant 
governor a 42 percent increase over 1986 eight are running for 
the us senate and 68 for the house 
black candidates for statewide and federal office number 52 
including 21 incumbents according to figures compiled by the joint 
center for political studies the research organization tracks 
black politics 
gantt is the lone black nominated for the senate and his race 
is a heated one he has pulled a few points ahead of helms in the 
polls with his campaign hoping for a dramatic upset 
the milestone for women this year is that many are mounting 
serious races for the senate and statewide offices political 
activists say 
having dianne feinstein and ann richards run as credible 
competitors for very major and very important governorships is 
historychanging said wendy sherman executive director of 
emilys list a group that raises money for female democratic 
candidates 
win or lose it does change the landscape we believe forever 
neither of them are beginners in contrast to the lambs to the 
slaughter women candidates of the past she said 
in fact said jane danowitz executive director of the womens 
campaign fund if theres an irony to the 1990 election its 
that women are finally positioning themselves as traditional 
serious candidates and now the electorate favors the mavericks 
now that weve learned to play the game theyve changed the 
rules she said 
nonetheless women are looking to make significant gains 
rep pat saiki rhawaii is considered the best shot women have 
at gaining a senate seat she is running against appointed 
incumbent daniel akaka 
two other republican senate hopefuls who have received 
considerable attention but are lagging in the polls behind 
democratic incumbents as election day nears they are rep lynn 
martin seeking to unseat sen paul simon in illinois and rep 
claudine schneider running against sen claiborne pell in rhode 
island 
democrat patsy mink an asianamerican and a former 
congresswoman won a special election to fill the last few months 
of akakas house term and is in a good position to keep the seat 
other races where gains for women intersect with those expected 
for minorities include those of three likely new members of the 
congressional black caucus 
maxine waters a los angeles democrat virtually assured to 
succeed rep gus hawkins a retiring black caucus member 
eleanor holmes norton a democrat trying to succeed walter 
fauntroy as the district of columbias nonvoting delegate to 
congress 
barbara rose collins a democratic detroit councilwoman who is 
considered a shooin over carl edwards to succeed outgoing rep 
george crockett 
other house races to watch involving women include these 
contests where the incumbent is not seeking reelection 
rosa delauro a connecticut democrat in a strong race against 
thomas scott a republican state senator 
sandra scofield a democrat running against republican bill 
barrett the speaker of the nebraska legislature 
trudy coxe a republican environmentalist running against 
democratic state sen john f reed in rhode island 
with two women governors madeleine kunin in vermont and rose 
mofford in arizona stepping down democrats are putting high bets 
on feinstein richards and barbara roberts who has made a strong 
showing in oregon 
other women seeking governorships include republican arliss 
sturgulewski in alaska democratic state treasurer joan finney in 
kansas republican barbara hafer in pennsylvania and republican 
mary mead in wyoming 
in addition nebraska gov kay orr a republican is seeking 
reelection 
observers say overt sexism has not played much of a role in this 
years races except in texas where republican clayton williams has 
made a practice of outlandish remarks he made light of rape in 
one and also joked he planned to hogtie richards and drag her 
through the dirt 
women have run pretty much genderless campaigns said 
danowitz noting that the candidates have run not just on issues 
like abortion rights but also taxation crime and defense 
platforms 
in minority politics the republican party is trying to make 
history by electing the first black gop member of the house of 
representatives since 1935 when rep oscar depriest of illinois 
left office 
the gop has three blacks running former cincinnati mayor j 
kenneth blackwell against current cincinnati mayor charles luken 
who wants to succeed his father rep thomas luken dohio gary 
franks running against former rep toby moffett in connecticut 
and businessman al brown who is trying to knock off rep romano 
mazzoli in kentucky 
of the three blackwell is considered the most likely to 
succeed 
in addition blacks stand to pick up one seat held by a white 
person two black democrats attorney marc morial and state sen 
william jefferson are competing in the openparty runoff to 
succeed retiring rep lindy boggs in louisiana 
another important signpost for blacks is the democratic 
nomination of a black theo mitchell to run for governor of south 
carolina 
although mitchell isnt likely to win his candidacy shows 
inroads by blacks at the state level in southern states according 
to david bositis senior research director at the joint center for 
political studies

list for fleeing child molestation charges was arrested one week 
after being featured on the television show unsolved mysteries 
kenneth robert stanton was arrested without incident by fbi 
agents as he emerged from a motel in rock hill on wednesday 
agents began looking for him in the area after he was identified 
as a suspect in the molestation last week of a 9yearold girl in 
rock hill about 70 miles north of columbia 
fbi agentincharge john harley said stanton who turns 52 
today was being held in columbia and awaiting extradition to 
georgia 
the huntington ind native was charged with fondling two girls 
in warner robins ga in june 1989 while posing as a police 
officer 
in all he faces 11 counts of child molestation involving girls 
in georgia alabama and mississippi last summer harley said 
stanton was not charged with the rock hill incident but was a 
suspect harley said 
stanton posed as a variety of authority figures to gain access 
to homes harley said 
stanton fled his moraine ohio home after fbi agents were led 
there by the oct 24 episode of nbcs unsolved mysteries 
harley said 
more than 150 people called to say he was living and working in 
the dayton ohio area where he had gotten married two weeks ago 
according to an unsolved mysteries news release 
stanton who was wanted by federal authorities for unlawful 
flight to avoid prosecution was placed on the 10 most wanted list 
last week by fbi director william sessions harley said 
it appeared that stanton was traveling throughout a broad 
area of the country molesting children in a calculated way which 
indicated to us that he was going to continue doing it until he was 
apprehended harley said 
the list normally is reserved for people accused of violent 
crimes 
stanton also faces charges of burglary and impersonating a 
police officer in georgia 
in the 1960s stanton was charged with sex crimes against 
children and was committed to a state psychiatric hospital in 
michigan he later escaped but was recaptured in arizona and 
returned stanton remained at the hospital until doctors decided he 
was fit for release

a spokesman for the archbishop of canterbury urged 
the british government today to restore diplomatic ties with syria 
to help secure the release of british hostages held in beirut 
spokesman john lyttle said the governments refusal to tal was 
a silly way to conduct foreign policy 
on wednesday lyttle attended a meeting in dublin between the 
families of british hostages and the relatives of four iranian 
diplomats missing in lebanon since july 1982 
the gettogether was organized by the iranian embassy in dublin 
at the request of brian keenan an irishman who was freed from four 
years of captivity in august following intervention by syria 
also at the meeting were the wife and brother of the archbishop 
of canterburys special envoy terry waite the father of tv 
journalist john mccarthy the nephew of retired pilot jack mann and 
keenans two sisters 
it was a very moving meeting it was an amazing demonstration 
i think of a shared common grief lyttle said in an interview on 
british broadcasting corp radio 
he said there was hope for a release of british hostages but 
added i think for the first time the families of the british 
hostages have a quite serious disagreement with the policy of the 
british government that is the policy towards syria 
britain broke diplomatic relations with syria in 1986 after 
accusations of syrian involvement in a terrorist plot to blow up an 
israeli airliner at heathrow airport 
lyttle accused britain of wanting syria to admit its involvement 
and to in effect grovel 
you cannot expect one state to grovel to another any more than 
you can expect one individual to grovel to another if you want to 
have some successful outcome you have to look at how syria has 
behaved over recent years whatever they may be accused of doing 
four years ago he said 
lyttle noted that syria has sent troops to the multinational 
forces arrayed against iraq in the persian gulf following the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
yet we maintain the attitude that we will not talk to them we 
will not have diplomatic relations with them that is a silly way 
to conduct foreign policy lyttle said 
a foreign office spokesman responded we have consistently 
made clear our wish to normalize relations with syria but there are 
unresolved problems he refused to elaborate but observers say 
britain is still concerned by syrias alleged involvement in 
terrorism 
mariam moussavi whose husband seyyed is believed to have been 
kidnapped by lebanese christian forces said the iranian families 
were asking other governments to help us see our loved ones 
again

the justice department said today it had found 
no evidence so far that terrorists exploited an undercover drug 
investigation to bomb pan am flight 103 but the allegations would 
be reviewed by the fbi 
deputy attorney general william p barr said that while at 
this time we know of no evidence giving credence to these 
allegations it is important to examine these allegations and to 
determine their credibility as soon as possible 
as part of its ongoing investigation into the 1988 bombing over 
scotland that killed 269 people the fbi will review reports that 
terrorists used a drug enforcement administration undercover 
operation in europe to put explosives on the pan am flight 
both the dea and the fbi have been looking into the allegations 
in the last few days since they were aired by nbctv but law 
enforcement sources speaking on condition of anonymity said no 
substantiation had been found 
after the report was aired tuesday night the dea put out a 
statement that it was investigating the allegations that terrorists 
may have substituted luggage containing explosives for heroin that 
undercover agents were allowing on board usbound aircraft in 
frankfurt germany 
the undercover investigation nicknamed operation courier 
was said by nbc to be aimed at tracking heroin shipments to detroit 
by lebanese drug traffickers 
nbc reported that terrorists may have discovered that an 
arrangement between the dea and german security officials would 
enable them to substitute luggage containing bombs for suitcases 
containing heroin 
one of those killed in the blast over lockerbie scotland was a 
21yearold suburban detroit resident khalid jaafar who was 
returning home from lebanon 
investigators once believed that jaafar had unwittingly checked 
a brown samsonite bag containing a bomb before boarding the flight 
in frankfurt later they determined that jaafar carried two smaller 
bags on board the airplane both bags were subsequently recovered 
following the explosion over scotland 
the new yorkbound flight originated in frankfurt and stopped in 
london where passengers and luggage were transferred to a larger 
airplane

the boston globe today endorsed republican william 
weld for governor saying the former us attorney has the 
disposition and character to face the states economic and 
fiscal problems 
the globe said in an editorial that weld and his democratic 
opponent john silber were evenly matched on some scores but gave 
weld the edge saying his leadership style was more likely to get 
results 
the newspaper praised welds record as a us attorney saying 
he combatted organized crime and profiteering by defense 
contractors 
the globe also said weld has come out unequivocally on 
womens issues favoring job equity expanded day care and 
abortion rights 
silber on leave as president of boston university was credited 
by the globe for his intelligence and competence in his 
professional field but faulted for his tarttongued behavior 
and his intimidating tactics 
a smaller newspaper in the western massachusetts town of 
pittsfield the berkshire eagle endorsed silber today in an 
editorial headlined a fingerscrossed vote for silber 
the eagle said the risk with weld is that it would take a long 
time for him to learn the ropes in state government and discover 
where savings can be achieved without hurting the states 
vulnerable citizens 
with silber the newspaper said people have gotten a glimpse 
of a searching mind that is open to new approaches 
mr silber for all his prickliness and occasional outright 
wrongheadedness has earned a chance to show what he can do the 
editorial said

federal agents say they found similarities 
between a pipe bomb used by a georgia man in 1972 and bombs that 
killed a federal judge and an attorney last year 
the bombs construction was unlike that of any of 10000 bombs 
that federal agents have dissected agent frank p lee of the 
federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms said in an 
affidavit made public wednesday 
similarities included the use of square end plates with 
threaded rods extending from plate to plate within the pipe and 
secured with nuts the february search warrant affidavit said 
that construction is unique to the explosive device walter 
leroy moody jr was convicted of having in 1972 and three of four 
mail bombs sent in december 1989 lee said 
he said he based the conclusion on a computer search of atf and 
fbi records describing more than 10000 bombs nationwide since 
1975 
one of the december bombs killed judge robert vance of the 11th 
us circuit court of appeals in atlanta another killed savannah 
lawyer robert robinson two other bombs were safely intercepted at 
the 11th circuit offices and at the jacksonville fla office of 
the naacp 
moody 56 of rex is a suspect in the slayings but has not been 
charged hes being held without bail on unrelated charges 
moody and his wife susan 27 are charged with obstruction of 
justice bribery and witness tampering for allegedly trying to 
erase his 1972 conviction for possessing the pipe bomb that injured 
his exwife hazel 
the moodys have requested separate trials walter moodys trial 
is set for nov 27 
us district judge anthony a alaimo on monday granted the 
moodys request to move the trials from macon to brunswick where 
he is based the ruling was made public in a written order 
wednesday 
alaimo gave no reason for moving the trial the moodys 
attorneys had argued that extensive news coverage had hurt chances 
of getting a fair trial in macon 
us district judge wilbur owens of macon had removed himself 
from the case at moodys request and was replaced by alaimo 
moodys attorney edward d tolley also wants alaimo removed 
arguing that the case shouldnt be heard by any judge in the

bowing to pressure from environmentalists 
mcdonalds corp announced today it will phase out plastic foam 
packages for its big macs and other food 
although some scientific studies indicate that foam packaging 
is environmentally sound our customers just dont feel good about 
it mcdonalds usa president edward h rensi said so were 
changing 
the decision was hailed by an environmental group which 
predicted mcdonalds will be a trendsetter in the industry 
mcdonalds understands that the future is green said fred 
krupp executive director of the washingtonbased environmental 
defense fund i think other companies will follow suit 
krupps nonprofit group has worked with mcdonalds since august 
to devise the phaseout plan said krupp who joined rensi at the 
companys oak brook ill headquarters for the announcement 
i think its a big day for the american public said rensi 
weve been studying this issue of environmental problems and 
mcdonalds is not interested in doing anything but the right 
thing 
rensi said the company based in oak brook ill will begin 
eliminating its foam sandwich containers within 60 days 
he said the sandwich containers account for nearly 75 percent of 
the fastfood chains foam use and the move would mean a 
significant reduction in the volume of packaging used by 
mcdonalds 
some communities have banned polystyrene containers outright 
putting additional pressure on mcdonalds 8000 us restaurants to 
eliminate the use of plastic foam 
jim cantalupo president of mcdonalds international said the 
company would continue testing for the best materials to replace 
plastic foam and would phase them into our restaurants as they 
become available 
the plastic sandwich boxes will be replaced by paper products 
manufactured in a new process that will preserve the foods 
temperature and freshness rensi said the company is still trying 
to determine suitable replacements for plastic cutlery and the 
plastic cups in which coffee is served he said 
mcdonalds has for years defended its use of the plastic which 
lingers for decades in landfills 
in april rensi said mcdonalds which serves 22 million people 
daily worldwide had no plans to shift away from using plastics he 
said polystyrene containers could be recycled while coated paper 
used in food packaging often could not 
he also said then that the company would spend 100 million a 
year on recycled materials when building outlets or renovating 
mcdonalds last week posted a record net income of 2422 
million or 67 cents a share for the third quarter

atlantis secret military flight 
next week has been postponed because of problems with a satellite 
aboard the shuttle that reportedly will spy on iraq 
the air force said wednesday it was delaying the nov 9 launch 
to resolve anomalies discovered during cargo testing details 
are classified and it is too early to predict a new launch date 
the air force said in a statement 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity estimated the delay 
would be one to two weeks 
the delay was disappointing news for nasa which just last week 
pronounced atlantis free of dangerous hydrogen leaks and ready to 
fly after being grounded during the summer along with columbia 
columbia passed a leak test as well on tuesday 
shuttle director bob crippen said today that nasa is going ahead 
with plans to launch columbia with the 150 million astro 
observatory in december following atlantis flight he said nasa 
was working with the air force to resolve the problem with 
atlantis cargo 
a specific target launch date for the columbia mission will 
not be determined until after the flight readiness review has been 
conducted and performance data from atlantis flight have been 
analyzed crippen said 
nasa officials have said they want at least three weeks between 
the flights 
civilian experts have said atlantis secret cargo is a satellite 
that will spy on iraqi forces 
it is the seventh shuttle flight dedicated entirely to the 
pentagon and the last classified mission two more military 
missions are planned both next year but their cargoes are 
unclassified 
the bottom line is its no longer affordable to maintain 
security said a pentagon official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the space agency had planned nine missions this year but 
because of the leaks in columbia and atlantis it hopes now to get 
six aloft 
nasa last launched atlantis on feb 28 on a classified mission

the us court of appeals in chicago has upheld a 
30yearold federal aviation administration rule that forces 
commercial airline pilots to retire at age 60 
the threejudge panel voted 21 wednesday against a group of 
airline pilots who sought to have the rule overturned 
but all three judges voiced reservations about the ruling the 
senior judge hubert will wrote a strongly worded dissent 
the faa established the retirement rule in 1960 and has argued 
consistently that allowing pilots to fly beyond age 60 would be 
dangerous 
critics say that pilots in their 60s have experience that 
benefits passengers and cite the 1989 crash of a united airlines 
jetliner in sioux city iowa to back their case 
in that crash a 57yearold pilot landed a jet despite a 
crippled hydraulic system 
while safety is the dominant and controlling consideration 
the faa should not take this ruling as a signal that the age 60 
rule is sacrosanct and untouchable us appeals court judge 
richard cudahy said in writing for the majority 
but cudahy said there was insufficient evidence to overrule the 
agencys concerns that older pilots pose health and safety risks 
lawyers for the 30 pilots said they had not decided whether to 
seek a rehearing from the appeals court or to take the issue to the 
us supreme court 
pilots older than 60 have have twice as many accidents as those 
in their 50s but theyre still safer than pilots in their 20s or 
30s according to a congressional report released last month 
the office of technology assessment which did the study 
reached no conclusion on whether the federal aviation 
administration should revise its regulation forcingretirement at 
age 60 for pilots on major major airlines those which operate 
planes with more than 30 seats 
no such requirement exists for corporate private or 
commuterairline pilots 
last month the federal equal employment opportunity commission 
sued lockheed corp over the companys requirement that its test 
pilots retire at age 60

four homeless people have filed a classaction 
lawsuit against the city seeking clean and safe public toilets 
the suit filed wednesday against the city and two transit 
agencies contends the failure to provide toilets constitutes a 
public nuisance it says the plaintiffs three men and a woman are 
forced to endure continual embarrassment humiliation physical 
injury and hazardous conditions 
the legal action center for the homeless which represents the 
plaintiffs said the lack of public toilets in the city is a 
hardship not only for the homeless but also for pregnant women 
the elderly tourists and outdoor workers 
its getting worse every day said executive director doug 
lasdon its disgusting 
a report by the center said that of 105 transit authority rest 
rooms surveyed fewer than onethird were open to the public and 
half of those were in bad condition 
a survey of 526 stations in the citys 1540 parks found that 
nearly threequarters were closed filthy foulsmelling or 
without toilet paper and soap 
leland jones a spokesman for the mayors office said im 
not sure this lawsuit moves us any closer to really dealing with 
much more difficult issues like the adequacy of housing stock 
betsy gotbaum commissioner of parks and recreation said she 
was committed to solving the problem of unclean restrooms but 
added i dont believe comfort stations should be used by 
homeless people to take baths to take care of their personal 
needs because that makes them unavailable for other people to 
use

the leader of a rightwing coalition 
that defeated former prime minister benazir bhuttos party at the 
polls was chosen today to head pakistans fifth civilian government 
in 43 years 
nawaz sharif whose backers shared in a landslide victory in the 
oct 24 parliamentary elections was assured the prime ministers 
post after receiving the nomination from 18 parties comprising the 
islamic democratic alliance 
the next prime minister will be elected by secret ballot in the 
217seat national assembly the lawmaking lower house of 
parliament voting could take place as early as sunday 
the new parliament is to be sworn in saturday since the 
alliance controls 105 seats in the assembly the vote for sharif is 
seen only as a formality 
a battle for the prime ministers job had been expected between 
sharif and ghulam mustafa jatoi who served as caretaker prime 
minister after ms bhuttos government was ousted on corruption 
charges three months ago 
according to coalition members jatoi reluctantly bowed to 
sharif 
sharif 41 a wealthy industrialist was ms bhuttos fiercest 
opponent and chief minister of eastern punjab the largest province 
and the powerhouse of pakistan politics 
as leader of the winning alliance he has been largely credited 
with orchestrating the campaign that denied ms bhutto and her 
pakistan peoples party a second chance at power 
the moslem league the party that spearheaded the campaign for 
the creation of pakistan in the 1947 partition of the indian 
subcontinent is the largest member of the islamic democratic 
alliance the looseknit coalition that spans the ideological 
spectrum 
the decision to choose sharif was made during a meeting of 
senior party officials said moslem league president mohammad khan 
junejo it was not known when or where the meeting took place 
jatoi has headed the caretaker government since president ghulam 
ishaq khan on aug 6 dismissed ms bhuttos administration after 
only 20 months alleging corruption and mismanagement 
ms bhutto faces several corruption charges filed by special 
courts investigating her former administration 
sharif told reporters today no new cases would be filed against 
ms bhutto disputing her claims that another 16 party loyalists 
would soon be charged 
jatoi is still believed to be heavily favored by the countrys 
two most powerful institutions the military and the bureaucracy 
sharif is seen by many groups in pakistan as a possible catalyst 
to improve conditions in pakistan where most of its 110 million 
people are landless illiterate and earn about 400 a year 
his familys multimillion dollar steel foundary was launched by 
his father from a lone oven in the ancient eastern city of lahore 
the business diversified to include steel foundary sugar and 
textile mills 
sharif closely guards information about his personal wealth 
im certainly not as rich as the bhuttos he once told 
reporters when asked to estimate his wealth

former housing secretary samuel pierce 
directed federal grants to political friends and later misled 
congress about his involvement congressional investigators said 
today 
their report stopped short of concluding pierce committed 
perjury before a house panel or that he and others at the agency 
violated criminal laws it said those questions would be left to 
the special prosecutor now investigating pierce 
an attorney for pierce said the report was politically motivated 
and contained spurious allegations 
the report the result of a house subcommittees 16month 
investigation of the reagan administrations department of housing 
and urban development said pierce concealed the extent of his 
involvement in the steering of federal housing grants 
at best secretary pierce was less than honest and misled the 
subcommittee about his invovlement in abuses and favoritism in hud 
funding decisions the report said at worst secretary pierce 
knowingly lied and committed perjury during his testimony 
the report was released by the house government operations 
committee whose employment and housing subcommittee investigated 
the scandals involving favoritism mismanagement and political 
abuse at hud where pierce served as secretary throughout the 
reagan years 
pierce appeared before the panel in may 1989 then invoked his 
fifth amendment rights against selfincrimination in refusing to 
appear for further questioning 
subcommitee chairman tom lantos dcalif said in an 
accompanying statement that pierce tried to distance himself from 
the abuses and political favoritism at hud when he appeared 
before the panel 
he stated that he never told these people to fund 
anything lantos said however sworn testimony from other 
witnesses and a paper trail of documents suggest that he was 
directly and intimately involved in the abuses and favoritism in 
hud funding decisions 
pierces lawyer paul perito said he had not seen the report 
but dismissed it as the last gasp of a politically oriented and 
motivated investigation by the house panel 
with all of these spurious allegations there is not one piece 
of evidence that mr pierce violated his oath by receiving anything 
of value or in any way defrauding the united states government 
perito said 
they have been suggesting alleged perjury from day one he 
added once again there is nothing in the record to support the 
conclusions regarding the alleged perjury 
among the reports findings 
hud under pierce was an agency in total disarray and was 
woefully mismanaged housing programs established to help the 
poor were abused and hud was enveloped by influence peddling 
fvoritism abuse greed fraud embezzlement and theft 
the section 8 moderate rehabilitation program a system of 
grants to private developers to renovate housing for the poor 
became a cash cow which was milked by former hud officials and 
the politically wellconnected abuses in that program alone 
could cost the goverment 413 million in overpayments the report 
said while other hud problems will cost taxpayers more than 1 
billion 
officials at many public housing authorities around the 
country were aware the selection process for the moderate 
rehabilitation program was being abused but chose to exploit it 
rather than attempt to expose abuses 
deborah gore dean pierces executive assistant from 1984 to 
1987 was at the focal point of funding decisions for the moderate 
rehabilitation program the panel cited as evidence many dear 
debbie letters from developers and politically connected 
consultants seeking grants and deans actions in directing hud 
officials to sign programfunding documents 
but the report said congressional investigators were unable to 
conclude whether dean acted on her own or whether she was acting 
at the direction or with the approval of pierce it said evidence 
indictated she directed grants to political allies at the behest of 
pierce on several projects including the durham nc hosiery 
mill project while on other projects such as seabrook apartments 
in new jersey dean appeared to be the chief proponent 
dean refused to testify before the panel citing her 
constitutional rights against selfincrimination 
there was a pattern of favoritism shown to pierces former new 
york law firm battle fowler jaffin and kheel including 
assistance to clients of that firm who were seeking moderate 
rehabilitation grants 
the report criticized the hud inspector general as unfairly 
singling out one hud official thomas demery as the focus of the 
700page investigative report on the moderate rehabilitation 
program that triggered the hud scandal in early 1989 others such 
as pierce and dean were barely mentioned then 
the congressional report praised the inspector generals office 
for revealing abuses but said the watchdog did not bark loud 
enough in its earlier reports on problems in the agency it said 
congress should have paid more attention and it said congress 
should halt the practice of earmarking funding in appropriations 
bills for specific housing projects it favors 
the bush administrations secretary jack kemp drew praise for 
acting to clean up the agency

president bush said today he is more 
determined than ever to drive iraqs saddam hussein out of 
kuwait 
bush embarking on a sixday crosscountry campaign blitz for 
endangered republicans told a gop rally in this boston suburb i 
want desperately to have a peaceful resolution to this crisis at 
the same time the presidents spokesman told reporters bush was 
deliberately raising his profile on the gulf crisis 
if we do have to take dramatic action we want them the 
american people to know why white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said he did not elaborate 
bush said he wanted to make it very very clear there will 
be no compromise on the united nations demands for a complete 
withdrawal of iraq from kuwait 
today i am more determined than ever this aggression will not 
stand he said the brutality against innocent citizens will 
not be tolerated and will not stand 
bush said he still intended to give economic sanctions time to 
work 
no one wants a peaceful end to this crisis more than i do but 
no one is more determined to see this aggression turned back and i 
will not change on that fundamental point of morality he said 
bush said that the united states and the rest of the world 
remain united in anger and outrage at the treatment of hostages 
by iraqs brutal dictator 
the president asked his audience to join him in setting aside 
partisan politics when it came to his administrations persian gulf 
policy 
i am not a cynic i have no apologies only pride at being at 
a partisan event he said but for the moment set partisan 
politics aside 
fitzwater also said there would soon be a turning point in 
the status of the us diplomats remaining in the embassy in kuwait 
city 
at some point theyve either got to leave or be 
reprovisioned he said he declined to say how many days longer 
the group could hold out he said he did not want to tip off 
saddam 
in bushs campaign speeches today the president appeared to 
tone down his harsh criticism of congressional democrats on budget 
issues instead bush devoted nearly half of his first speech to 
discussing the gulf situation 
fitzwater said bush was being urged to continue his caustic 
attack on democrats in certain quarters but he surveyed the 
whole matter and decided this was the best approach thus 
fitzwater said the president has decided to spend more time 
highlighting the gulf standoff 
while realizing he might be subject to attacks for politicizing 
the gulf situation fitzwater said because he is president we 
didnt see how he could duck it 
we want a public debate over new developments in the persian 
gulf we want public knowledge of this fitzwater said 
responding to reports that saddam had invited hostage families 
to visit their relatives in captivity in iraq and kuwait over the 
christmas holidays fitzwater said why doesnt he let the 
hostages come home that would be the best way or better yet 
thanksgiving 
bush campaigned here for republican gubernatorial candidate 
william weld who is seeking to succeed retiring gov michael 
dukakis bushs 1988 democratic presidential opponent 
while the president says he is keeping the two subjects the 
iraqi confrontation and politics separate bush was expected to 
make repeated references to the persian gulf standoff as he 
travels

later he planned to campaign in orlando fla before ending 
his day in cincinnati 
bushs political journey will end election day in houston when 
he votes at his home precinct his legal residence is a suite 
at the houstonian hotel 
the president was focusing on a handful of tight races in the 
closing days of the midterm elections 
in orlando he was seeking to rally lastminute support for 
republican gov bob martinez who is facing a spirited challenge 
from former democratic sen lawton chiles 
with the presidents popularity in the polls slumping and 
republicans seeing their hopes for big midterm gains evaporating 
some candidates in tight races have been keeping bush at arms 
length 
a stop planned for this week in illinois was canceled after gop 
secretary of state jim edgar who is running for governor and rep

vermont once the most republican state 
in the nation may soon send a socialist to fill its lone seat in 
the house of representatives 
bernard sanders is emphasizing his longstanding disillusionment 
with capitol hill to mount a strong challenge to republican rep 
peter smith 
the us congress is hopelessly and pathetically out of touch 
with the needs of ordinary americans says sanders a socialist 
running as an independent 
the latest polls show sanders in a dead heat with freshman 
congressman smith 
the democratic candidate dolores sandoval is running third 
most state democrats are abandoning her as too liberal and too 
unlikely to win 
smith has questioned how effective an independent can be in 
congress where committee assignments are made by republicans and 
democrats sanders says hell ask to caucus with the democrats but 
its unclear whether he would be admitted 
sanders says hes not a member of the socialist party but is a 
socialist with a small s 
the last time an independent served in congress was in 1975 and 
the last time a house member called himself a socialist was in 
1929 
smith has countered his opponents strong showing with 
television ads accusing sanders of being sympathetic to the 
socialist regime in cuba the ads contend sanders is a politician 
who doesnt represent vermont values 
sanders says smiths ads engage in vicious dishonest 
redbaiting 
smith responds that sanders is trying to outrun his history 
sanders meanwhile is relentless in his attacks on washington 
and while congressbashing is a newly popular song for some 
politicians this fall its an old favorite of sanders 
what the two major candidates are saying is irrelevant 
regarding the problems facing this country sanders said in a 
1971 special election campaign for a us senate seat the people 
who make decisions which affect this country have little to do with 
the average man in the street 
and in this campaign he said multinational corporations and 
wealthy people are able to buy and sell politicians who then go 
down to washington to fight for tax breaks for the rich and 
cutbacks in programs for the elderly 
sanders also rejects the democratic party which he once called 
ideologically bankrupt 
such comments alienated former democratic gov thomas salmon 
who is supporting smith one of the most liberal gop members in the 
house but former democratic gov philip hoff sides with sanders 
smith voted with democrats more than half the time in 1989 
according to congressional quarterly he received a 65 percent 
approval rating from the liberal group americans for democratic 
action and a 27 percent rating from the american conservative 
union 
smith just back from capitol hill after the lengthy budget 
battle is encountering opposition from gun groups angry because he 
backed a measure to ban the sale of certain semiautomatic rifles 
the national rifle association is airing antismith radio spots 
and circulating bumper stickers 
i would have voted for you but the nra says youre not the 
man to hire one man said as smith campaigned this week 
sanders began his campaign decrying congress handling of the 
savings and loan scandal but has found new fodder in the fight 
over the federal budget 
smith was the first rankandfile member of either party to back 
the original budget deficitreduction package a vote sanders 
termed one of the most disastrous votes ever cast by a 
representative from vermont 
smith defends the vote saying because the budget package was 
only a start it was important to back the bipartisan plan developed 
by the democratic and republican leadership of congress and the 
president 
smith was one of only 10 republicans to support the democratic 
budget plan that eventually passed the house sanders has said he 
could not support that plan because of its medicare cuts

federal mismanagement of some of the worlds 
most productive timber lands has cost the government at least 90 
million since 1986 an interior department audit disclosed 
thursday 
mishandling of bureau of land management forests in western 
oregon is the result of financial shortcuts prompted by budget 
cutbacks the departments office of inspector general said 
the report said the blm lost 90 million by failing to perform 
thinning fertilization and other maintenance that resulted in 
fewer trees that could be cut the blm estimated it lost 94 million 
board feet of timber growth in the fiscal years 198689 due to 
inadequate management a board foot is one foot by one foot by one 
inch 
in addition the blm has failed to acquire easements to 132000 
acres with 800 million board feet of mature timber valued at 302 
million 
losses could total as much as 17 billion over the forests 
60to 80year life cycles the report said 
the audit of blm forestry operations on 24 million acres across 
18 oregon counties criticized the agency for failing to explain the 
magnitude of the losses to congress and the office of management 
and budget 
blm director cy jamison said in response to the review that his 
budget requests have been somewhat constrained by funding 
targets provided by the interior department its parent agency 
these targets which are less than ideal to accomplish the 
desired workload are consistent with the goals of the 
administration to reduce federal deficits jamison said in a memo 
to the inspector generals office 
the audit covering fiscal years 198689 noted that blm forestry 
revenues will further decline as additional lands are taken out of 
production to protect the threatened northern spotted owl 
the blm estimated in june that efforts to save the owl from 
extinction may directly affect 23 percent of its lands in western 
oregon about 553000 acres and may indirectly affect another 15 
million acres there 
the blm holdings are some of the most productive timber lands 
in the world said the audit prepared by assistant inspector 
general harold bloom 
bungling of the forest program is especially costly because the 
program historically returns 430 for every 1 spent the audit 
said 
the review questions whether the blm will be able to achieve 
next years timber harvest target of 750 million board feet because 
the agencys funding request for its forestry program was more than 
20 percent short of the 66 million needed 
it also discounts blm claims it can use smaller fragmented 
tracts of timber to replace timber from larger tracts of forests 
where logging is being banned to protect the rare owl 
easements for the smaller scattered tracts of timber lands 
have not been obtained because the bureau has concentrated on 
obtaining legal access for the larger consolidated tracts the 
audit said 
in addition the audit said the blm has 
based its budgets on plans to use herbicides to control 
underbrush although herbicides have been banned on oregon blm lands 
since a federal judge issued an injunction in 1984 manual efforts 
cost three times more than herbicides 
failed to place sufficient priority or secure sufficient funds 
for maintenance of the tree plantations including placing tubes 
around seedlings to protect them from wildlife 
failed to perform intensive management programs including 
fertilization and precommercial thinning to provide proper spacing 
between trees

vice president dan quayle says the world 
cannot allow iraqs saddam hussein to keep his ballistic missile 
and chemical weapons even if he withdraws from kuwait 
you cannot simply allow saddam hussein to have this military 
power and have the technology into the future quayle said 
wednesday night in an interview on pbs macneillehrer newshour 
quayle reiterated that the united states main objectives in the 
persian gulf are the unconditional withdrawal of iraqs troops from 
kuwait restoration of the legitimate government of kuwait release 
of all hostages and peace and stability in the gulf 
but quayle said we would have to go beyond that if those 
objectives would be achieved because you cannot simply allow saddam 
hussein to have this military power and have the technology into 
the future 
i believe that the world certainly understands that a saddam 
hussein who has ballistic missiles who has chemical capability 
biological capability who would like to have the nuclear 
capability cannot continue to have that capability even if he 
withdraws from kuwait said the vice president 
this man is a terrorist this man is a murderer said 
quayle 
craig whitney a spokesman for quayle said today his 
comments were fully in line with the administrations views and 
policies 
white house chief of staff john sununu told reporters aboard air 
force one today between campaign stops in massachusetts that 
quayles statement was in accordwith what president bush has been 
saying sununu said bush has made clear his problem is not with 
the iraqi people but with the dictator who created the kind of 
problem we have

iraq said today it would free four american hostages soon 
and scoffed at reports the captives were being illtreated 
washington again demanded the freedom of all the captive 
foreigners 
aboard the amphibious assault ship uss iwo jima navy sailors 
and marines held a somber memorial service for 10 mates killed in a 
boiler room steam leak tuesdays accident was the worst suffered 
by the navy since operation desert shield began in august 
iraqi information minister ladif jassim at a news conference in 
baghdad today did not give the names or whereabouts of the four 
american hostages to be freed but said they were elderly and sick 
he did not say when they would be released 
the iraqi official repeated the baghdad governments contention 
that the united states was trying to use the hostage issue as a 
pretext for a military attack he insisted they were being treated 
well 
all the americans at sites have complete freedom they can 
watch tv read books and read newspapers they also enjoy the 
friendship of iraqi forces jassim told reporters 
iraq is holding hundreds of westerners at strategic 
installations as shields against a feared attack in letters 
released today by a s official two of the captives described 
their isolation and anxiety 
you can survive but individually interned one must be 
psychologically capable of living alone within himself said one 
of the letters 
it ended with a plea please do not forget the guest 
hostages iraq refers to the captives as guests 
the names of the letterwriters were not released for security 
reasons the letters were brought to the us embassy by 
nonamerican foreigners said the official speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
president bush in a speech in burlington mass said today the 
united states and the world community were united in anger and 
outrage at the treatment of hostages by iraqs brutal 
dictator saddam hussein 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater asked about iraqs 
offer on wednesday to allow holiday visits by families of hostages 
said why doesnt he saddam let the hostages come home that 
would be the best way or better yet thanksgiving 
bush said today he still hoped for a peaceful solution to the 
gulf crisis but insisted there will be no compromise on the 
united nations demands for a complete withdrawal of iraqi forces 
from kuwait 
the white house meanwhile was silent today on comments made 
wednesday night by vice president dan quayle who said it was not 
enough to force saddam out of kuwait he said the world cannot 
allow the iraqi leader to keep his arsenal of chemical weapons and 
ballistic missiles 
we would have to go beyond that if those objectives would be 
achieved because you cannot simply allow saddam hussein to have 
this military power and have the technology into the future the 
vice president said in an interview on pbs macneillehrer 
newshour 
a soviet envoy who met twice last month with saddam says the 
iraqi president is more open to a peaceful settlement than he was 
in early october 
yevgeny primakov also said wednesday that iraq agreed that 2500 
soviet citizens can leave iraq before the end of november he said 
34 soviet military experts were flying home to moscow today 
meanwhile a published report today quoted us officials as 
saying that if there is an allied assault on kuwait by sea iraq 
plans to blow up several oil tankers the report in the washington 
times said three tankers are anchored near the saudi arabian coast 
and there may be others as well the information was attributed to 
pentagon military and intelligence officials who were not named 
the offer of holiday visits for the hostages which came 
wednesday from an information ministry spokesman in baghdad was 
branded by britains foreign office on wednesday as a cynical 
propaganda move 
its probably just another psychological ploy said dawn 
bazner whose husband mark was videotaped early in the crisis 
asking saddam to let foreign women and children go 
im hoping that we wont have to visit mark there but if 
it comes down to it i will go she said in palm desert calif 
former west german chancellor willy brandt announced wednesday 
that he is traveling to baghdad next week at saddams invitation 
the german government today endorsed the planned trip as the most 
suitable way to try to secure the release of hostages 
about 400 germans are among thousands of foreigners stranded or 
held in iraq brandt who won the 1971 nobel peace prize for 
helping improve eastwest relations said he was going as a private 
citizen and not to represent bonn 
last weekend european leaders meeting in rome agreed not to 
send envoys to baghdad to try to secure the release of countrymen 
reasoning that doing so would only help saddam in his attempts to 
divide the antiiraq alliance 
iraq has been allowing westerners to leave on a piecemeal basis 
nearly 300 french citizens left on monday

federal safety officials focused today on 
failure of a critical plane engine part as they probed the probable 
cause of a crashlanding that took 112 lives at sioux city iowa 
in 1989 
a metallurgist told the national transportation safety board 
that a defect in a critical engine disc had been present since 
day one 
the metallurgist james wildy said a socalled hard alpha 
defect a spot of nitrogen inside titanium from which the disc 
was made was never detected over the life of the engine part 
he said the defect was located less than an inch from the point 
on the disc where a defect would be most critical 
that defect has been in there since day one wildy said 
referring to the manufacture of the 370pound fan disc by general 
electric in 1971 
the fan disc originally 32 inches in diameter was recovered in 
two pieces from corn fields in iowa in october 1989 nearly three 
months after the accident at the sioux gateway airport near sioux 
city 
during the boards meeting members praised the response of the 
crew to the engine explosion which shredded the hydraulic system 
of the united airlines dc10 jumbo jet causing crew members to 
lose almost all control 
a board staff member said the flight crew was able to keep 
minimal control of the plane by manipulating the two remaining 
usable engines in a very crude and rude flight control system 
it was no mean feat said board member john lauber 
it was in fact exquisite and resulted in the saving of 
lives he said 
the transportation safety board was to vote later on a report 
drafted by its staff after a lengthy investigation into the 
disaster 
the board will vote on the reports conclusions its finding as 
to the probable cause of the accident and its safety 
recommendations 
the crash of united flight 232 occurred after an explosion in 
the tail engine of the dc10 shredded the planes hydraulic system 
sending it into a 42minute spiral during which pilots struggled to 
maintain control 
at a hearing in sioux city on oct 31 1989 safety board 
investigators said they were not ready to conclude that a hairline 
crack in an engine fan disk caused the explosion 
but they acknowledged that a focus of the investigation was the 
possibility that a flaw in the disks metal caused the explosion 
sending pieces of metal ripping through that aircrafts tail 
section and severing the hydraulic lines that give pilots control 
the fan disk from the dc10s tail engine was found in two 
pieces in corn fields near alta iowa about 80 miles east of sioux 
gateway airport where flight 232 cartwheeled and burst into flames 
as its pilots tried to make an emergency landing 
in july the safety board without concluding what caused the 
accident called on the federal aviation administration and the 
engine manufacturer general electric co to develop new 
inspection methods to detect cracks before they reach dangerous 
proportions 
last march the faa sought changes in the dc10s hydraulic 
system to enable pilots to steer the plane even if hydraulic lines 
are severed in the planes tail section 
crew members of flight 232 said that once the hydraulic lines 
were cut their only means of steering the aircraft and controlling 
its descent was to selectively accelerate the remaining wing 
engines

a federal judge has ordered 107 
million in tax refunds for property owners in the kansas city 
school district but only to the 9000 taxpayers who filed formal 
protests 
the refund involves a property tax increase ordered by us 
district judge russell g clark in september 1987 to help finance 
school desegregation 
the us supreme court in april declared the 1987 increase 
unconstitutional its unanimous ruling said clark exceeded his 
legal authority in directly raising the districts tax rate from 
205 to 4 on each 100 assessed value but it also said federal 
judges may order local officials to raise property taxes to help 
desegregate public schools 
the money to be refunded has been held in an escrow account by 
jackson county and will not come out of the districts current 
budget or from the state 
i thought that was good for the district because we dont 
have any money said school board president julia hill she 
applauded clarks order implementing the refund thats what the 
school board asked for were quite pleased about that 
clarks refund order which was dated oct 29 but arrived from 
his office in springfield on wednesday said refunds would go only 
to the taxpayers who followed the protest process required by 
missouri law 
homeowners due refunds will receive 3705 for every 10000 of 
property value 
arthur benson ii lawyer for the plaintiffs in the desegregation 
case said that limiting refunds to the people who protested was 
appropriate he did not protest his property taxes and will receive 
no refund 
he said he was sympathetic to those who failed to protest their 
tax payments im sorry for them and im sorry they wont get a 
refund benson said but people have an obligation to protest 
their rights 
some of kansas citys largest businesses should receive a big 
portion of the refunds hallmark cards inc for example protested 
more than 1 million in tax payments 
thousands of people also paid their 1988 and 1989 property taxes 
under protest but none of those payments will be refunded clark 
ruled 
the supreme court ruling held that the method used to set the 
districts tax rate in 1988 and 1989 even though it did not rely 
on a vote of the people was constitutional because of that clark 
said there was no cause to refund those payments 
on monday the supreme court let stand a ruling that boosted 
clarks power to order predominantly white suburban schools to 
accept innercity black students the justices without comment 
rejected an appeal by three suburban school districts facing such a 
desegregation order

boxer mike tyson fighting a demand for up to 
25 million in punitive damages after a jury found he fondled a 
woman in a nightclub testified today that he made more than 20 
million in 1989 
the former heavyweight champion was questioned by the womans 
attorney about a financial statement putting tysons net worth at 
15 million as of feb 28 
asked how much he earned this year tyson said i had a bad 
year this year apparently referring to his defeat in february by 
james buster douglas 
the jury awarded sandra miller a 26yearold computer operator 
just 100 in compensatory damages for the dec 10 1988 incident 
she had sought 1 million the jury today began a second phase of 
the civil trial to determine whether the woman should receive 
punitive damages 
tyson who testified earlier during the trial acknowledged that 
he was at the manhattan disco that night but denied knowing or ever 
touching miller 
her lawyers planned to call as a witness today another woman who 
has sued tyson over an allegedly similar incident the same night at 
the disco 
the jury in the civil case deliberated 4 hours wednesday before 
finding that tyson grabbed millers breasts and buttocks after she 
refused his advances at bentleys disco in 1988 tyson had denied 
knowing or ever touching miller 
the fighter said of the verdict if they thought it was 
serious they would have given her more than 100 bucks 
the jury ruled that tyson committed battery but not assault 
us district judge michael b mukasey had told jurors that assault 
required no finding of contact but must include a threat while 
battery requires actual contact 
miller said she felt great that they know that he did it 
in closing arguments tysons attorney robert hirth told the 
jury that miller had made up her claims to get money from tyson 
you should send a message that if sandra miller wants to 
engage in a getrichquick scheme she should buy a lottery 
ticket hirth said 
compensatory damages are awarded to compensate victims for pain 
and suffering medical bills and any losses such as lost income or 
a damaged reputation punitive damages are awarded to punish the 
party responsible

a clear plastic coffin buried under 6 feet 
of dirt and wet concrete for a halloween escape trick collapsed 
under the weight and killed the wouldbe houdini locked inside with 
chains and handcuffs 
about 150 people including the magicians children and wife 
watched as aides frantically dug at the dirt and cement to try to 
rescue joseph burrus 
they attempted to get him out but it did no good said 
police lt roger enmark 
burrus a recovering addict was performing the stunt to benefit 
a drug treatment clinic 
the 3 feet of dirt and 3 feet of concrete were estimated at 9 
tons 
burrus who billed himself as amazing joe said before the 
stunt that he considered himself a successor to the great escape 
artist harry houdini 
i consider myself a master of illusion and an escape artist i 
believe i am the next houdini and greater burrus said 
to me that is what an escape artist is to put myself in an 
impossible situation and get out of it

a middleaged woman pinched her shabby 
sweater in a gesture of disgust it cost half her monthly wage of 
about 50 
a teenager wore the same troubled expression in a murky muddy 
alley five minutes walk from tiranas showcase skanderbeg square 
these are the streets of a capital he sighed 
after more than four decades of isolationist rule under enver 
hoxha the balkan nation of 32 million is slowly opening to the 
outside the glimpses offered are often of hardship and 
frustration 
official propaganda under hoxha who died in april 1985 
lauded the communist leaders success in modernizing albania 
the soviets helped until the 1961 when relations were broken 
because of albanias stalinist and prochinese policies sixteen 
years later albania severed ties with the chinese 
then albania was largely on its own importing items such as 
east european trucks or discarded west german buses in barter for 
exports of chrome chemicals or produce 
progress was made albania without railways in 1944 now has 
built up industry harnessed its mountain rivers for power and 
expanded agriculture even with a larger education system children 
may still tramp miles to school 
the economy has a far longer journey to rival even former east 
bloc nations 
windows are lacking in homes schools and dingy buses lopsided 
from decades of use and neglect 
factories in towns such as kavaje fier patos and ballsh all 
south of tirana seem as if they were abandoned in war sometimes 
a glimmer of light or a face at a window reveals that some work is 
going on 
in these cities most albanians live in dingy threestory 
apartment blocks many of the balconies festooned with laundry 
are stacked with firewood for winter heat cooking is mostly done 
by kerosene lamps are often just bare bulbs 
in some cases the environment has been sacrificed for industry 
oil derricks around qitet i stalin and ballsh leak streams of 
black oil into the earth around them 
lignite mined for heat or power gives the air in tirana a 
choking tang familiar in many other east european cities 
industrial emissions spew uncontrolled into the air 
in towns onestory dwellings reminiscent of the stone huts seen 
in villages often nestle between the blocks sometimes they are 
surrounded by a walled garden sheep or other animals may be 
tethered nearby 
in its efforts to improve daily life the communist government 
of president ramiz alia has begun to allow citizens to sell surplus 
produce from homes or collective farms at private markets 
prices however are relatively high meat often scarce in 
state stores goes for more than 1 a pound 
families drag their own sheep or goats to be slaughtered and 
cooked at communal bakehouses where women also arrive with 
uncooked cakes for baking 
vegetables are generally available around the nation which has 
many sunny fertile plains leeks spinach carrots beans 
shriveled crab apples and eggplants were on sale in late october 
from 20 cents to 50 cents for a kilogram equal to 22 pounds 
yet even agriculture has been hit hard by this summers drought 
which alia admitted in august had cost the equivalent of 20 
million in lost power generated by hydroelectricity and an 
estimated 60 million in lost industrial production 
western diplomats in tirana argue that alias new course of 
democratization in albania was dictated solely by economic 
need 
when communism fell across eastern europe albania lost 
virtually its only source of barter trade and was compelled to open 
up the diplomats said speaking on condition of anonymity 
foreign businessmen and experts trickle into tirana to discuss 
helping the economy american oil experts in the capital in late 
otober said they were impressed with what albanian experts had 
achieved with outmoded equipment but said foreign help is needed 
for progress 
there is talk in the official media of breaking with one of the 
most sacrosanct tenets of hoxha the ban on foreign loans and 
indulging in joint ventures other articles have relied on more 
traditional propaoganda to encourage the people to work harder 
there is no import without export is a popular slogan 
invoked in this effort but soviet toothpaste 4 a tube italian 
dishwashing liquid 2 a bottle and sunglasses 15 a pair among 
the only foreign goods seen in stores 
one way in which albania could earn foreign currency is through 
tourism mountains which cover 70 percent of the country offer 
spectacular scenery and unspoiled wildlife the adriatic and ionian 
coasts boast warm beaches 
yet the flow of tourists is presently only about 10000 yearly 
far lower than neighboring nations of greece and yugoslavia 
hints of the world beyond the borders comes from yugoslav greek 
or italian tv or the voice of america radio broadcasts in 
albanian prized radiocassette players offer a chance to play 
muchcopied tapes of western rock n roll music 
many albanians see their only hope as leaving while children 
pester foreign visitors for gum or pens adult albanians often 
murmur visa visa to passing foreigners 
i can stay said a woman at a factory in tirana 
she then pointed to her son 
but he its better he gets out

thousands of romanians took to the 
streets today to protest price rises that doubled or tripled prices 
on a wide range of goods 
about 2500 demonstrators occupied the main downtown square in 
bucharest and about 10000 people demonstrated in the central city 
of brasov demanding that a partial deregulation of prices be 
rescinded 
they should have made sure products are available before 
raising prices insisted one man at the bucharest rally their 
policy only creates fear 
the commerce ministry said the new price policy which 
officially went into effect this morning would double prices for 
clothes public transport and furniture among other items 
essential foodstuffs energy and rents remained protected for 
the time being 
romanians appeared increasingly frustrated and confused by the 
reforms claiming they were not adequately informed about them 
their frustration was compounded by a lack of goods in the stores 
many shops were closed 
no one has any idea whats going on said one man who was 
shopping 
protesters shouted slogans accusing president ion iliescu and 
the government of being cryptocommunists and of unfairly raising 
prices under the guise of liberalization 
iliescu and his national salvation front who took power in the 
december revolution that ousted communist dictator nicolae 
ceausescu promised gradual reforms and social protection but 
after the front won overwhelmingly in may elections roman sped up 
the process of reform 
both chambers of parliament resumed a joint session today 
premier petre roman asked the two houses to grant the government 
special powers to impose temporary valueadded and income taxes by 
decree 
but finance minister teodor stolojan and economics minister 
eugen dijmarescu dispatched to parliament to argue the 
governments case encountered opposition most of it came from 
members of their own national salvation front 
petrisor morar a deputy from the small opposition party 
romanian unity alliance demanded a noconfidence vote against the 
government and began collecting the 150 signatures necessary to 
hold such a vote 
he accused the government of not providing social protection 
against the reforms 
valentin gabrielescu of the national peasant party said his 
party would but the national liberal partys dinu patriciu said he 
would back the government 
its inevitable that price reforms occur and it will require 
sacrifices any government would have to do this patriciu 
said 
deputy reform minister dorel sandor said that if the government 
fell it would only delay the same reforms by a year meaning 
a tragedy for the economy 
in july legislation on the sale of failing stateowned 
industries was approved last month the government slashed their 
credits and energy subsidies 
roman who attended a closeddoor session of parliament late 
wednesday to discuss the economic program was quoted by state 
radio as warning the only alternative to a market economy was a 
return to the past 
in addition to the price reforms the national currency was to 
be devalued today by more than 50 percent to help exports the new 
rate was 35 lei to the dollar 
under the price increases that were to take effect today 22 
pounds of carrots would go from four lei about 11 cents to 10 lei 
about 28 cents but most food items energy and rents are to 
remain controlled until next year 
i cant force stores to raise prices said finance ministry 
price director ghoerghe oana from this point on factories are 
selling at different prices and this will eventually affect the 
consumer but stores are essentially free to do what they want

two former coworkers testified today that 
nancy cruzan whose sevenyear coma has been the subject of a 
longrunning legal battle would not want to continue being kept 
alive 
i have no doubt mary ann smith of joplin said when she was 
asked by attorney bill colby whether ms cruzan would reject all 
efforts to keep her alive in her comatose condition 
tom turner former owner of an oklahoma city office supplies 
store where ms cruzan worked briefly said in videotaped testimony 
that they once talked about the case of karen ann quinlan who 
lived in a similar comalike condition for nine years after she was 
removed from a respirator 
nancy was very specific about what she would want if she were 
in karens situation that was she would not want to be kept alive 
under those circumstances it was almost like she found the thought 
of being maintained in a vegetative state unforgivable 
reprehensible or repulsive turner said 
colby represents joe and joyce cruzan who are seeking to have 
their 33yearold daughters feeding tube disconnected so she may 
die as they believe she would want 
the us supreme court last summer rejected the parents 
request but colby said he had new evidence showing that ms cruzan 
would want to die he planned to have three former coworkers 
testify in jasper county circuit court the three have not 
previously testified in the case 
mrs smith of joplin said she and ms cruzan worked as teacher 
aides at a private school for severely handicapped deaf and blind 
children in 1978 and got to be very close 
she said they had several conversations about what they would 
want their family to do with them if they became as severely 
handicapped as some of the children they cared for 
mrs smith recalled a conversation with ms cruzan and a teacher 
in march 1978 while ms cruzan was holding and attempting to feed a 
3yearold girl who was the most severely handicapped child at the 
school ms cruzan was trying to feed the child with a tube 
inserted through the throat and into her stomach 
she talked about how pitiful she the girl was and she didnt 
know she was alive so severely retarded she could live all her 
life and not know the beauty of life mrs smith said 
she said they talked during a onehour period about how none of 
them would want to be kept on lifesupport equipment in such a 
state mrs smith said if she were in the girls condition she 
would want the plug to be pulled ms cruzan shook her head 
yes she said 
we were all in agreement we would not want to put our 
families through that she said 
colby told the court in his opening statement you will find 
the cruzans are almost out of emotions its been a long and trying 
three years 
however colby said the family still has lots of love for 
their daughter 
ms cruzan suffered permanent brain damage when her car 
overturned on the road home from work on jan 11 1983 doctors say 
she is incapable of reacting or relating to her environment and can 
experience no thoughts or emotions 
on oct 23 judge charles e teel jr dismissed the state as a 
party in the case at the request of missouri attorney general 
william webster webster argued that his involvement was no longer 
necessary because the missouri supreme court and the us supreme 
court have set guidelines on when food and water can be withdrawn 
from comatose patients 
in its first righttodie decision the us supreme court ruled 
54 in july that the state could keep a patient on life support in 
the absence of clear and convincing proof that the person would 
want to die 
ms cruzan left no written instructions about what she would 
want done under such circumstances however her parents and sister 
say they know she would have rather died than be kept alive in such 
fashion 
colby says the testimony by ms cruzans former coworkers will 
meet the clear and convincing standard

religious riots sparked by hindu 
fundamentalists attempt to seize a moslem mosque intensified 
thursday and the death toll in nine days of clashes rose to more 
than 200 
news agencies and officials reported at least 31 people died 
across the country on thursday they were killed in battles between 
hindus and moslems or when police fired on mobs or when victims 
died in hospitals of injuries suffered in earlier riots 
at least 210 people have died since oct 24 when the fighting 
began 
most of the deaths were in uttar pradesh the state where the 
disputed shrine is located and in gujarat state both states have 
a history of sectarian clashes and simmering tensions between 
hindus and moslems 
uttar pradesh is indias most populous state at least 30 
percent of its 120 million people are moslems violence has erupted 
in 22 of its 63 districts according to police officials in 
lucknow the state capital 
the disput has also caused riots in neighboring bangladesh an 
islamic nation where moslem mobs attacked temples and hindu shops 
and homes after hearing of the violence in india 
at least one person was killed in dhaka which is under curfew 
along with the port city of chittagong 
in ayodhya site of the disputed mosque the bodies of three 
hindus were found thursday in the saryu river 
the victims were apparently killed tuesday when police opened 
fire to throw back hindus who stormed the mosque residents said 
at least seven people are previously known to have died in the 
police action 
the discovery of the bodies led to the deployment of extra 
government troops around the dusty temple town and forced hindu 
groups to postpone a fresh attempt to storm the mosque 
but members of the fundamentalist world hindu council vowed to 
continue their efforts to take over the disputed site ashok 
singhal the councils general secretary told a public meeting 
outside ayodhya his group would not give up its campaign to replace 
the mosque with a temple 
singhal is wanted by the police his appearance at a 
wellpublicized meeting attended by thousands of people lent 
credence to reports that many police officers are sympathetic to 
the hindu movement 
there is no power on earth which can stop us from building the 
temple singhal told the crowd there is no place for islam in 
our nation 
singhal who wore a bandage around his head sustained injuries 
during tuesdays attack on the temple he later slipped away from 
the hospital where he was treated 
the world hindu council says the 460yearold babri mosque is 
built over the birthplace of lord rama one of the most revered 
hindu gods 
at least 900 people were killed in hindumoslem violence last 
year when the group first announced its intention to take over the 
site by force 
the dispute has threatened to bring down prime minister vp 
singhs 11monthold government a prohindu party which had 
supported the government coalition withdrew its backing two weeks 
ago when its president was arrested while leading a march to drum 
up support for the temple construction 
in another political development thursday the congress party of 
former prime minister rajiv gandhi supported the government of 
chimanbhai patel a member of singhs national front coalition in 
a vote of confidence in the gujarat state assembly 
patels government had been reduced to a minority after the 
hindu rightwing bharatiya janata party withdrew support in line 
with its decision to jettison the national front coalition in the 
federal parliament 
congress party leaders in new delhi defended the decision by 
saying they were willing to support the national front but not 
singh they have said the party will oppose singh in the nov 7 
confidence vote but could support a national front government if 
singh were replaced as prime minister 
political commentators and newspapers have attacked singh for 
what they call his vacillation on the templemosque dispute saying 
it is the greatest threat to indias political system since the 
country became independent in 1947 
india is predominantly hindu and all its prime ministers have 
belonged to the majority community but tolerance of all religions 
and secularism is a part of its constitution 
hindus make up 82 percent of indias 880 million people and 
moslems comprise 12 percent of the population the others include 
sikhs christians and buddhists

iraq has removed about 300 armored vehicles 
from kuwait while adding more artillery pieces in the occupied 
persian gulf nation the pentagon said thursday 
bob hall a pentagon spokesman said that defense department 
analysts see little significance in the changes he noted that an 
estimated 430000 iraqi military personnel are still in and around 
kuwait the same number as a month ago 
it doesnt change their posture which is primarily one of 
defense with the capability to switch to an offensive campaign 
hall said 
the spokesman said the pentagon estimates that iraq now has 
2200 armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles in 
kuwait and southern iraq compared with 2500 before 
the number of iraqi artillery pieces in the area has risen from 
1700 to 2200 hall said while the iraqi tank count remains at 
3500 the united states has at least 220000 military personnel in 
the gulf plus about 800 tanks 
hall said he could not comment on bush administration plans to 
send additional forces to the gulf he said any announcements would 
come only after the deployments were under way defense secretary 
dick cheney said earlier this week that the us flow of military 
personnel to the gulf would continue possibly adding as many as 
100000 forces 
hall also said the aircraft carrier uss midway had arrived in 
the north arabian sea in the last few days bringing the number of 
us carriers in the region to four 
hall declined to discuss the movements of other us warships in 
the area but the navy said recently that the carrier uss 
independence was due to leave the area soon and that the midway 
would be its replacement

a group of antiabortion republicans led by 
phyllis schlafly said thursday it will ask gop officeholders to 
sign a pledge reaffirming the partys stand against abortion 
the undertaking by the newly formed republican national 
coalition for life is designed to counter efforts by another group 
whose members advocate abortion rights and a change in the plank 
the party has adopted in its last three national platforms 
the purpose of our committee is to make sure the party does 
not abandon its principled stand mrs schlafly president of the 
conservative eagle forum and a director of the new group said at a 
news conference 
she said more than 100 gop officeholders already have signed the 
pledge to reaffirm the plank and support republican candidates 
opposed to abortion 
to be effective elected officials must no longer waffle or be 
wishywashy on their prolife convictions said beverly lahaye 
president of concerned women for america 
the national republican coalition for choice formed last year 
supports candidates who favor abortion rights and advocates a 
change in the party platform which states the unborn child has 
a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed 
in 1989 democrats running for governor and lieutenant governor 
of virginia governor of new jersey and mayor of new york won on 
abortion rights platforms against gop candidates who had 
antiabortion records but tried to moderate their stance 
the national party has said it welcomes prochoice candidates 
despite its stance in the platform 
mrs schlafly said the new group isnt supporting candidates in 
tuesdays elections but that it likely would form a political 
action committee to support antiabortion republican candidates 
what we want to say is that you make a great mistake when you 
abandon your position mrs schlafly said look at the way 
george bush has fallen in the polls when he retreated from his 
read my lips pledge against a tax increase its a loser

house democratic leaders called on federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan thursday to show his support for a 
recently enacted budget compromise by reducing interest rates 
the american families that will endure the hardship of deficit 
reduction now merit the rewards of lower interest rates and 
continued employment house majority leader richard gephardt 
dmo and rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house 
budget committee said in a letter to greenspan 
a driving force behind yearlong efforts to cut the deficit was 
an expectation that credit markets and investors would be convinced 
it would reduce government borrowing and ease pressure on interest 
rates 
gephardt said the agreement which is expected to reduce the 
deficit by 490 billion over five years provides the deep 
enforceable cuts that greenspan and others had recommended 
having honored our commitment to a sound national economy we 
now ask that you provide the agreement with the endorsement that 
financial markets seek the lawmakers wrote that endorsement 
would be shown publicly they continued by allowing an easing of 
credit conditions in the united states 
gephardt and panetta said a onequarterpoint reduction in 
shortterm rates announced earlier this week sends an ambiguous 
message to the markets and would limit the benefit of the 
deficitreduction package on our economic growth

american consumers debt binge during the 
1980s increases the likelihood the next recession will be long and 
deep a liberal policy research group said thursday 
if we do experience a recession its impact will be much more 
severe than if consumer debt were at a lower level said 
university of californiariverside economic professor robert 
pollin 
pollins study deeper in debt the changing financial 
condition of us households said americans debt compared with 
their disposable income was at a postworld war ii high of 939 
percent in 1988 in the mid1970s the ratio hovered around 75 
percent 
the debt overhang will cause consumers to cut back spending even 
more sharply than they would otherwise in an economic downturn 
deepening any recession said the report prepared for the economic 
policy institute a liberal think tank financed partly by labor 
unions 
any added pressure on consumers is particularly significant 
because their spending amounts to roughly twothirds of the 
nations economic activity as measured by the gross national 
product 
mortgage foreclosures and personal bankruptcies already have 
been increasing during the past decade and would rise even higher 
in a recession the study said 
all this would add to the pressure on the financial system 
already troubled by the collapse of the savings and loan industry 
and a high rate of bank failures it said 
banking regulators who have vigorously urged institutions to 
use greater care in making real estate and corporate buyout loans 
have remained relatively quiet about consumer lending 
however one regulator comptroller of the currency robert 
clarke warned bankers in january about an increase in sour 
consumer loans 
economist robert dugger of the american bankers association 
suggested the effects of any consumer retrenchment would ripple 
through the economy unevenly 
manufacturers of luxuries would be hit harder than companies 
making necessities he said also people would default on 
unsecured credit card loans before falling behind on their 
mortgages 
the credit situation of average and moderateincome 
households is more fragile than it has been for years fragility 
however doesnt mean that its going to break he said 
bank data shows that lenders and borrowers already are 
exercising greater caution he said outstanding consumer and home 
equity loans totaled 427 billion at the end of june down 6 
billion from six months earlier 
consumers tend to compensate for drops in income by borrowing 
more for instance inflationadjusted aftertax personal income 
in september fell 03 percent in september but real spending rose 
03 percent according to the commerce department 
consumers did that by dropping their savings rate to a 
threeyear low but that can only go on for so long 
pollin disputed what he said were several widelyheld notions 
about why consumer debt is increasing the buildup is notthe 
result of a consumption binge nor did it occur because the baby 
boom generation entered its prime borrowing years he said 
most americans except for the wealthiest 20 percent have 
needed to borrow more in order to maintain their living standard in 
the face of stagnating income and rising housing costs he said 
although it is true that younger people borrow more heavily than 
people nearing retirement older americans also increased their 
borrowing in the 1980s he said

police placed hundreds of 
thousands of blacks under curfew thursday surrounding their 
townships with roadblocks under new restrictions intended to curb 
blackonblack fighting 
the leader of the black opposition inkatha freedom party 
mangosuthu buthelezi said the violence was the major obstacle to 
negotiations to include blacks in a new constitution 
but a spokesman for the african national congress inkathas 
main rival denounced the government measures as a highhanded 
bullyboy action and said they would only lead to more bloodshed 
buthelezi met with president fw de klerk as part of the south 
african leaders effort to begin talks with black opposition groups 
on ending apartheid factional fighting between inkatha and the 
anc led by nelson mandela has slowed efforts to begin the 
negotiations 
law and order minister adriaan vlok said late wednesday the 
recent violence had made it necessary to introduce extraordinary 
measures in three townships outside capetown khayelitsha 
crossroads and lingulethu 
similar restrictions were lifted from 11 townships around 
johannesburg where fighting has died down 
vlok declared the capetown townships unrest areas and said 
police would use their expanded powers to prevent violence 
the restrictions give police wider powers to prevent 
demonstrations and other forms of protest but are not as broad as 
those in effect during a nationwide state of emergency that was 
lifted in june 
reinforcements were called in from pretoria to enforce the 
measures which included a 9 pm to 4 am curfew that began 
thursday officers set up barriers at the entrances to the 
townships and searched cars 
the police have information of further planned violence 
coupled with intimidation and protest marches vlok said 
in cape town anc spokesman trevor manuel said the actions would 
only further anger residents and that violence would not end unless 
town councilors in the townships step down 
the recent conflict has been beteen antiapartheid groups and 
the local town councilors many antiapartheid militants see the 
black councilors as collaborators with the whiteled national 
government 
the cape town townships had been relatively peaceful until two 
weeks ago when the wife of a leading antiapartheid militant in 
khayelitsha was slain since then clashes have broken out 
involving the militants and supporters of the town councilors 
unrest in the johannesburg townships has been more along tribal 
lines with supporters of the zulubased inkatha party facing off 
against xhosas and other blacks linked to the anc both groups 
oppose apartheid but differ on tactics to fight it and on their 
vision of a future south africa 
restrictions were lifted wednesday on 11 johannesburg townships 
where more than 800 blacks died in violence in august the measures 
were kept in effect in soweto the biggest township where at least 
16 people were killed in unrest this week 
in natal province meanwhile where thousands of blacks have 
died in factional fighting a regional inkatha leader was 
critically injured thursday after a bomb exploded in his car 
police said lancelot ntombela was driving in greytown when the 
device went off officials said 
also thursday police announced the arrests of five white men 
believed tied to rightwing organizations the men have not been 
charged but are being investigated for the possession of illegal 
weapons and possible links to recent violence the independent 
south african press association reported

nawaz sharif the architect of ousted 
prime minister benazir bhuttos stunning election defeat was 
poised thursday to head pakistans fifth freely elected government 
in 43 years 
sharif a wealthy 41yearold industrialist with humble 
beginnings was nominated by the rightwing islamic democratic 
alliance to be the next prime minister 
but a militant group in ms bhuttos home province of sind 
warned his election would bring protests and demonstrations 
sharif led his party to a landslide victory over ms bhuttos 
pakistan peoples party in the elections on oct 24 winning 105 of 
the 217 seats in the national assembly the policymaking lower 
house of parliament 
the assembly scheduled to convene saturday will elect the

caretaker prime minister since ms bhuttos government was ousted 
on corruption charges three months ago 
jatoi reluctantly bowed to sharif who offered him any cabinet 
post he wanted the offer was declined 
im not a job hunter jatoi said after a coalition meeting 
that ended his brief tenure 
throughout ms bhuttos 20 months in power sharif governed 
punjab province the powerhouse of pakistan politics and home to 
about 60 percent of the countrys 110 million people 
shortly after ms bhutto became prime minister in december 1988 
sharif organized 18 diverse parties into a coalition that became 
known by its urdulanguage intials of iji it had one goal to 
bring down ms bhutto 
twice ms bhutto and sharif tried but failed to oust each 
other 
ms bhutto governed until president ghulam ishaq khan dismissed 
her on aug 6 for corruption incompetence and abuse of power 
charges she steadfastly denies 
with the 37yearold former premier and her party effectively 
weakened many are now questioning whether the alliance of such 
diverse ideologies will hold together ms bhutto predicts its 
collapse within six months 
sharifs government will face daunting problems on all fronts 
tensions with its eastern neighbor india continue to smolder 
over disputed kashmir while a military and political stalemate in 
afghanistan pakistans western neighbor drags on and prevents the 
return of some 4 million refugees 
the economy is on the verge of collapse facing 2 billion in 
lost revenues from the persian gulf crisis washington has 
suspended nearly 600 million in economic and military aid because 
of suspicions about pakistans nuclear program 
although he has little experience in national government 
supporters say sharif is conscious of his weak spots and willingly 
accepts advise 
sharifs political career was launched in the early 1980s when 
the army ruled pakistan 
he is more in tune with the urban middle class than the landed 
families who have ruled pakistan since its creation in the 1947 
partition of the indian subcontinent he is seen even by the 
countrys left as a break from tradition and a catalyst that could 
end feudal control in pakistan where more than threefourths of 
the people are landless illiterate and earn less than 400 a year 
he is seen as a man of humble beginnings who worked hard to gain 
support 
his familys multimilliondollar steel foundary was launched by 
his father from an oven in a ramshackle building in the heart of 
punjab the business expanded and then diversified to include sugar 
and textile mills and now employs about 10000 people 
sharif often described as shy appears uneasy when asked about 
his family or their personal wealth certainly not as rich as the 
bhuttos he once replied when asked to estimate his wealth

former east german leader erich honecker says in a 
published interview that his countrymen are becoming aware of the 
rights and social services they have lost and he predicted that 
communism will recover 
in the end i will be seen to have been right honecker was 
quoted as saying in fridays edition of the european newspaper 
honecker interviewed in his small flat in a soviet military 
hospital compound outside berlin expressed no fear of facing 
criminal charges 
i am not afraid of a show trial i consider all the charges so 
far brought by the prosecutors office untenable honecker was 
quoted as saying 
i also reject responsibility for the figure cited by the 
prosecutors office of 200 killed on the gdr east german 
borders i have no personal guilt for that and what i ask myself 
about those who killed gdr border guards while violating our 
frontiers 
the european said honecker was interviewed by heinz judge a 
comrade of honecker in the antinazi resistance 
honecker whose communist regime was toppled in october 1989 
said it had been a great disappointment for me that so many 
people have forgotten socialism and turned to the dmark instead 
but i am not afraid that former gdr citizens would threaten me 
or lynch me despite the demonstration cries and banner slogans of 
the socalled democrats quite the contrary in the end i will be 
seen to have been right 
it has already become quite obvious to all what rights and 
social services they have lost honecker said 
he contended that the communist parties of the old east bloc had 
been brought down by intrigues but that they could bounce back 
what is needed now honecker was quoted as saying is a 
merciless investigation of the reasons for what has happened and 
the relevant conclusions to be drawn the communist movement has 
certainly suffered a defeat but it will recover 
he offered no apologies for his years in power 
everything i did i did in the knowledge that i was doing 
something for the people and for peace in the present situation 
they need scapegoats and i am being made the biggest one 
my wife and i are shocked by the allegations and calumnies 
against us we are accused of corruption and selfenrichment at the 
expense of the people but margot and i have nothing to reproach 
ourselves with we did not lead a life of luxury and we do not have 
a bank account in switzerland 
we are well enough looked after here by our friends at least 
my medical treatment is looked after 
but my wife and i do not understand why a basic constitutional 
right in the gdr is denied us that is the right to a proper 
apartment of our own 
we do not ask too much and want no privileges all we want is 
a perfectly normal flat like all other citizens here

residents of the los angeles region 
breathed easier during the summer of 1990 because ozone pollution 
dropped to its lowest level in more than 40 years and smog alerts 
declined 60 percent this year 
thanks to strict auto and industrial emissions standards and 
favorable weather the ozone level during the maytooctober smog 
season was down 24 percent from the period last year 
this is mindboggling joseph cassmassi senior 
meteorologist with the south coast air quality management district 
said wednesday when you compare it with the past its like 
night and day theres really been a dramatic improvement 
ozone released when the sun heats certain airborne pollutants 
is a powerful lung irritant it is especially harmful to children 
people with respiratory disorders the elderly and people who 
exercise outdoors however in the upper atmosphere it shields the 
earth from the suns harshest ultraviolet radiation 
alerts for high levels of ozone were issued in at least one of 
the regions cities on 41 days records show that compares with 54 
days in 1989 and 77 in 1988 going back to 1977 smog days occurred 
three times as often 
compared to the mayoctober period of 1989 there was a 60 
percent decline in the number of hours that the region exceeded the 
stage 1 level of smog containing 20 parts per million of ozone or 
more cassmassi said 
in addition the ozone problem from year to year has been 
shrinking in duration as well as the number of days the data 
shows 
the management district last year adopted a plan aimed at 
eliminating stage 1 alerts by the year 2000 the plan increases 
emissions controls for cars and industry and regulates various 
household products and even charcoal lighter fluid 
the lower pollutant levels were not apparent to the casual 
observer haziness produced by a mixture of soot and moisture 
continued to turn the horizon a dull brown officials said 
we can get ozone to zero and the public might not even notice 
it because they gauge air quality by visibility said district 
chairman norton younglove 
ozone levels peak from may through october because of strong 
sunshine and stagnant air that traps pollutants close to the 
ground 
a 24 percent ozone reduction should produce health benefits 
said dr robert phalen director of the air pollution health 
effects laboratory at the university of california irvine 
people with lung disorders would notice that this was an 
easier year for them phalen said and those of us who dont 
have a lung disorder are benefiting even though we dont notice it 
because smog episodes slowly erode lungs 
however dr ray casciari a physician in orange said he has 
seen no improvement in the health of the estimated 2000 lung 
patients his office treats annually but he said his patients have 
severe ailments and all they need is one sudden bad exposure 
to require medical care 
were encouraged but its still flat out awful said tim 
little executive director of the coalition for clean air a santa 
monica environmental group it doesnt show enough of a decline 
to even put us in the same league with the rest of the country 
cassmassi said 75 percent of the improvement in air quality is 
the result of lower emissions and 25 percent a consequence of the 
weather 
the biggest emissions drops traditionally have come from 
turnover of automobiles two million new cars are purchased each 
year in california new cars must meet stricter emissions standards 
that reduce pollutants by 90 percent compared to 15 years ago 
reductions also come from controls on heavy polluters such as 
oil refineries and aerospace plants the controls were enacted 
years ago but some are only now being enforced

homeless advocates predict that district of 
columbia voters on tuesday will restore one of the nations most 
comprehensive homeless shelter laws which was gutted because of 
city budget woes 
the city council fighting a 100 million budget deficit scaled 
back the 1984 law earlier this year amid complaints that housing 
the homeless has grown too expensive 
homeless advocates argue that costs have risen because city 
shelters are run inefficiently the advocates gathered petition 
signatures from 43000 voters to place a referendum on the ballot 
for tuesdays election 
it would reinstate the requirement to provide emergency 
overnight shelter to anyone who requests it 
i think were going to win maybe by a small margin but we 
are going to win said carol fennelly of the community for 
creative nonviolence the people of this city still want the 
district to do the right thing 
a poll in june showed support for such a ballot proposal at 71 
percent but an economic downturn has advocates worried that the 
referendum wont gain sweeping support 
we live in a time right now where people feel a certain amount 
of economic instability themselves fennelly said even though 
some of these people may now realize they are one or two paychecks 
away from homelessness the tendency may be to be conservative 
democratic mayoral nominee sharon pratt dixon and maurice 
turner her republican counterpart oppose the measure 
homeless advocates got a boost last week from a judge a 
temporary restraining order now bars the district from distributing 
antiinitiative literature that had been printed with taxpayer 
money 
that they have the audacity to print this material and use 
tax dollars to defeat something that voters say they want shows 
how the city feels about this said susie sinclairsmith 
director of the washington legal clinic for the homeless they 
have been trying to dismantle the program all along 
the district government has wasted money by housing the homeless 
in expensive hotels says fennelly mayor marion barry showered 
lucrative overnight shelter contracts on friends and campaign 
contributors fennelly and the late mitch snyder have said

house republicans trying to capitalize on 
anticongress feelings across america unveiled a television spot 
thursday accusing lawmakers of voting themselves a tax cut in the 
justcompleted budget deal 
the problem is its not true 
like as many as 4 million other americans whose incomes are in 
the range of 100000 to 200000 members of congress will see 
their top tax rate drop from 33 percent to 31 percent 
but also included in the package was an increase in the tax 
those same people would pay to support medicare more than wiping 
out the income tax cut 
in addition taxpayers in that bracket would lose some or all 
personal exemptions and some itemized deductions 
one analysis by the senate budget committee found a typical 
married member of congress with two children would pay 38 percent 
more in total federal taxes under the new law 
house members are paid 96600 a year but their salaries will 
increase to 124424 next year 
the gop television spot which will run nationally on cable news 
network this weekend and on local channels in three targeted 
congressional districts contends the average congressman will 
have their income taxes cut by 3500 
most democrats voted to raise their taxes and cut their own 
the ad contends most republicans voted against the tax increase 
and against the tax cut for congressmen 
rep guy vander jagt rmich chairman of the gop house 
campaign committee said he hopes the attack on congress will hurt 
democratic incumbents in tuesdays elections 
the tv spot does not mention that president bush who is 
stumping for gop candidates was instrumental in engineering the 
tax package or that it is part of an effort to cut the nations 
outofcontrol deficit by 496 billion over the next five years 
the three districts where the gop is paying to run the spot 
locally are the second district in utah where democratic incumbent 
wayne owens is in a tight reelection race cincinnatis first 
district where democratic incumbent rep thomas luken is retiring 
to make way for his son mayor charles luken who faces a deadheat 
race with former mayor ken blackwell and the illinois 16th a gop 
district being vacated by republican rep lynn martin

patrick loughlins father was a teamster who 
taught him early in life that a decent living depends on a high 
school diploma or a union card 
loughlin opted for the latter when he was a teenager whose 
family needed money he joined the newspaper pressmens union one 
of nine unions striking the daily news 
i would have a job for life i figured loughlin said 
since 1947 loughlin 61 has worked for three newspapers that 
folded hes hoping the daily news which is mired in a strike 
doesnt become the fourth 
ive always made a good living loughlin said wednesday 
i went into the service came back and i had a job waiting for 
me my seniority was protected everything was protected through 
the auspices of my union and their agreements with management he 
said 
as the strike against the news marks its first week loughlin 
doubts whether the nine unions on picket lines can reach new 
agreements with the newspaper 
its as if theyre saying to you all the things youve done 
and all the things youve gotten over the years are no longer 
there so start from page 1 again loughlin said 
loughlin married and the father of two daughters said he got 
his union permit for his 18th birthday 
i paid 3 a month to the union and that guaranteed me some 
kind of standing on the line loughlin said 
you would show up and state to the foreman that you were 
available and they would put you on a list and if there was work 
and there was at that time they put you to work 
he got his junior pressmens card while he was in the military 
serving in korea in 1960 he became a journeyman pressman 
the job wasnt glamorous 
you work nights you work saturday and sunday and you had to 
wait a long while to get different days off vacations loughlin 
said 
it was dirty 
you have to be willing and able to get covered head to foot 
with ink mist and paper dust and oil spinning off the presses 
and it was loud 
in the middle of that room with all those presses running 
its like standing at 42nd street in the subway with all the 
express trains going through without stopping continuously 
the union made it bearable by winning decent wages hours and 
benefits for its members and their families loughlin said 
loughlin said he plans to retire next year because of his 
seniority he expects hell find enough work until then even if 
the news shuts down but the prospects of younger pressmen arent 
as good he said 
some people will get some work at the new york times and the 
post he says the majority of them i dont know what 
theyre going to do many of them will lose their homes their 
plans for their childrens education will have to be changed 
local 2 of the pressmens union has dropped from more than 3000 
members in the mid1960s to about 900 members now as newspapers 
closed and others automated if the news closes another 400 
members will be out of work 
loughlin said he will stick with the strike to the end hes not 
very optimistic about how it will end 
i dont see too much future he said i know were in for 
hard times no matter what happens

the bank of finland halted trade with 
the soviet union on thursday because of confusion over exchange 
rates set by the soviets the central bank announced 
the bank did not publish its usual quotation for the ruble and 
the finnish mark meaning there was no official basis on which to 
exchange the two currencies 
to put it mildly we are somewhat unsure of what is going 
on said kari holopainen director of soviet trade at the bank of 
finland 
on thursday the soviets adopted a new exchange rate for 
commercial transactions that is nearly 70 percent lower than the 
official rate the move was designed to make soviet exports more 
competitive while discouraging imports 
holopainen said central bank officials were not informed by the 
soviets which of three ruble exchange rates now in effect applied 
to the clearing ruble used in finnishsoviet trade 
in any case we have stopped all payments in the 
clearinghouse trade with the soviet union for the time being he 
said 
under arrangements dating to world war ii threequarters of 
finnishsoviet trade is conducted by barter through a clearing 
house with cash accounts used to smooth out inequitis although 
barter with the soviet union represents only 11 percent of finnish 
total foreign trade 90 percent of finlands oil comes from soviet 
sources 
central bank officials said they believed it was the first time 
since the war that trade between the two countries was stopped 
finnishsoviet trade totaled 167 billion marks or 46 
billion in the first nine months this year holopainen said the 
currencies had been exchanged recently at rates near 65 marks to 
one ruble 
earlier this year officials announced the two countries would 
scrap their barter arrangement and conduct trade on a conventional 
basis the soviet union trades mostly raw materials for finnish 
industrial and wood products 
the barter system has already been eroded by trade with 
exchangeable currencies finnishsoviet barters accounted for 26 
percent of finlands foreign trade in the early 1980s compared 
with the present 11 percent level 
finnish officials said recently the soviet union owed finland 
about 19 billion in exchangeable currencies

the agriculture department is offering tips on 
a tollfree hotline about sending homecooked food and other 
goodies to the troops in the mideast 
the most important thing to remember is dont send foods that 
are perishable or cant tolerate rought handling hotline 
supervisor sue templin said thursday 
temperatures in saudi arabia are cooling somewhat with daily 
averages of 78 degrees fahrenheit in november and 70 degrees in 
december but potential food spoilage is always a problem she 
said 
hotline home economists worked with usda food scientists the 
military and the us postal service on a list of things to do and 
not do 
most importantly dont send fresh meat 
stick to dry beef like beef jerky or beef slims she said 
canned meats including chicken and tuna are okay but high 
temperatures may reduce quality 
templin said it would be a good idea for families to remind 
troops not to eat foods that arrive in damaged or swollen cans 
that often is a sign of food poisoning organisms 
also dont send highmoisture baked goods such as pumpkin 
bread because those are susceptible to mold pork and pork 
products along with alcohol are taboo in saudia arabia for 
religious reasons 
fragile good such as delicate cookies wont survive the trip 
intact and products containing chocolate can melt in high 
temperatures 
foods recommended by hotline people include dense and dry baked 
goods such as fruit cakes commercially packaged cakes and cookies 
in tins dry cookies like ginger snaps and crackers 
others on the send list include raisins apricots and other 
dried fruits along with canned nuts and fruit and commercially 
prepared trail mix jams jelly and peanut butter packed in jars 
also can be included along with hard candies and candycoated gum 
specialty items like instant soup fruit drink mixes and 
commercially packaged popcorn in tins are others 
some regional favorites like texas hot sauce and cajun 
seasonings are being sent to troops and thats a great idea as 
long as they arent perishable and can handle transport and heat 
templin said 
for more advice on shipping food and other food safety issued 
the usda hotline is available at 18005354555 weekdays from 10 
am to 4 pm eastern time residents in the washington dc 
area should call 202 4473333

a dozen youths some wearing halloween masks 
screamed trick or treat before attacking a homeless settlement 
with bats pipes knives and meat cleavers killing one man police 
said thursday 
nine people were injured 
why did they do it it was halloween said a policeman close 
to the case who would only speak on condition of anonymity last 
night things just got out of hand 
a 35yearold homeless man whose name was not released while 
police searched for relatives to notify had his throat slashed and 
was pronounced dead at the scene said a police spokeswoman 
officer janice swinney 
the wooded area where the attack occurred looked like a horror 
movie it was in the dark down a little path the police source 
said 
the gang which police said consisted of 10 to 12 people 
crossed a footbridge at 102nd street in manhattan into wards 
island on halloween night 
wards island is home to the fire department training academy 
several psychiatric hospitals and a sewage disposal plant it lies 
beneath the triborough bridge in the east river 
they went armed with meat cleavers bats with nails in them 
and pipes they were going to do serious damage the source said 
the gang walked to the homeless settlement where at least one 
of the gang members screamed out trick or treat followed by a 
epithet before the group began attacking the homeless men the 
source said 
there was no rhyme or reason to it other than out and out 
violence he added 
the gang also robbed two or three of the homeless men of about 
10 to 15 in pay they had received for performing minor chores 
it was a mixture of payday and halloween the source said 
gettin paid or payday is a street term used by roving 
gangs who rob people 
the gang escaped after the attack 
five of the injured homeless were treated at a hospital and 
released three others were treated by police at a precinct house 
and another man was listed as stable at harlem hospital after he 
was beaten about the face with a baseball bat

the central african country of rwanda 
claimed victory thursday saying loyalist troops had defeated 
rebels who invaded from uganda a month ago 
the announcement created overnight street celebrations in rwanda 
as army troops started returning to the capital kigali according 
to state radio and a western diplomat 
the armed struggle is over with rwandan forces being 
victorious against the rebels the government said in a 
nationwide broadcast citizens applauded the rwandan soldiers all 
the way from kagitumba to kigali 
kagitumba is the border post through which the rebels 
predominantly members of rwandas minority tutsi tribe invaded 
from uganda sept 30 the rebel rwandese patriotic front accused 
president juvenal habyarimanas singleparty government of 
corruption and say they want to replace it with a democracy 
the broadcast said the rwandan forces had waged a 36hour 
offensive monday and tuesday to retake kagitumba 
the insurgents emerged from a 250000strong population of 
rwandan refugees in uganda they were among hundreds of thousands 
of tutsis who fled rwanda when the majority hutu seized control in 
the late 1950s and early 1960s in a bloody power struggle 
reporters were taken to the border area of gitumba on wednesday 
to witness what the radio described as rwandan troops ejecting 
the nations enemies 
the broadcast quoted civilians who said the rebels had retreated 
to uganda taking livestock and at least one young rwandan girl 
ugandas president yoweri museveni who has condemned the 
invasion waged primarily by ugandan army deserters repeatedly has 
said his nations borders were closed to the insurgents and that he 
would arrest any who tried to return 
museveni is a man of his word and he said if the rebels return 
to uganda he will put them in jail said the western diplomat 
what we dont know is whether the ugandan government has arrested 
them 
there also were reports rebels could be hiding in rwandas 
kagera national park which borders uganda and tanzania to the 
east 
what we know is that the facetoface war is over there is no 
rebel army said the diplomat 
talks reportedly had been taking place between rwandas 
government and the rebels in zaire under the mediation of president 
mobutu sese seko 
if there is no rebel army what are they talking about the 
diplomat said 
the rebels reportedly were led by a former ugandan deputy army 
commander maj gen fred rwigyema a tutsi of rwandan origin

haitian refugees jammed into an overloaded sailboat 
told rescuers that 10 passengers were thrown overboard before a 
patrol found the survivors thursday a us coast guard spokesman 
said 
the haitians were battling each other when the cutter northland 
pulled alongside about 6 am just 20 miles north of haiti said 
lt cmdr jeff karonis 
they were fighting not with us but among themselves said 
karonis who added it was not immediately known what sparked the 
fighting or the alleged drownings 
ninetyfour people were packed into the 45foot boat and 
examinations showed many had cuts bruises and broken bones they 
also suffered from exhaustion and malnutrition 
the refugees told interviewers that several healthy people none 
wearing life jackets had been thrown off the boat about six days 
previously four nights later some sick and dying passengers were 
reportedly tossed overboard as well 
the haitians supplied the names of their missing boatmates and 
the people who allegedly threw them into the ocean but karonis 
said the coast guard could not independently confirm the drownings 
we dont have any way of proving it he said but there 
have been other incidents 
up to 60 haitians were thrown from a boat on its way to the 
united states in one 1985 incident and up to 100 people were 
drowned in another according to in investigation by the us 
immigration and naturalization service 
all the haitians intercepted thursday will be brought back to 
portauprince on friday karonis said 
reports on the case have been turned over to the us embassy in 
haiti he added he said he did not know if or when the alleged 
culprits would be arrested but said none were taken into custody 
aboard the northland

the commodities futures trading commission 
said thursday that contrary to white house assertions there is no 
evidence speculators are responsible for the recent escalation and 
volatility of oil prices 
commission officials told the senate governmental affairs 
committee that producers refiners and end users such as airlines 
account for 85 to 90 percent of the trading in crude oil futures on 
the new york mercantile exchange since iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
if anything it speculation has been at an unusually low 
level said commissioner william p albrecht speculative 
activity in these markets has actually fallen from preinvasion 
levels in terms of market share 
albrecht said a review of daily trading between july 30 and oct 
9 when prices peaked at 4042 a barrel shows that cash market 
prices for oil equalled or exceeded increases in prices on the 
futures market 
meanwhile he said oil prices have risen more in foreign 
markets than they have in the united states for example while the 
price of west texas intermediate exactly doubled on both the cash 
market and the merc prices for north sea oil on the london market 
increased 115 percent 
claiming there is no shortage of oil the bush administration 
has repeatedly blamed speculators in the futures markets for the 
spiraling prices since the embargo against iraq and kuwait cut off 
43 million barrels per day or about 8 percent of the worlds 
supply 
frankly there just is no way to justify price increases from 
24 to 39 a barrel except through speculation of futures 
buying white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said in 
september 
however albrecht citing energy department figures said the 
high prices reflect a daily shortfall in world production of 34 
million barrels a day in september and 11 million barrels in 
october despite increased production by saudi arabia and other 
exporting countries the energy department predicts that a daily 
shortfall of at least 350000 barrels will continue through 
december 
more recently he said concerns about the possibility of 
military hostilities and the effect this might have on oil 
production facilities and the future supplies of oil seem to have 
been the primary factor underlying rising and falling prices 
for example prices fell by more than 5 a barrel on oct 22 
when newspapers carried reports that iraqi president saddam hussein 
had a dream about settling the controversy and they jumped 183 a 
barrel wednesday upon president bushs claim that iraq was starving 
us hostages and that hes had it with saddam 
energy industry participants particularly refiners do not 
want to risk being caught short of oil in the event of further 
supply disruptions resulting from hostilities in the persian 
gulf said albrecht 
consequently he said their buying activity has bid 
up the prices of nearterm oil we have observed no excessive or 
suspicious concentrations of trading or positions nor have we 
found evidence of threatened or actual manipulations 
private analysts meanwhile repeated their assertions that 
bushs reluctance to tap the strategic petroleum reserve early in 
the crisis is responsible for oil prices going above 25 a barrel 
the high prices are attributable to the failure of government 
energy policy not organized commodity markets philip verleger 
an oil market analyst with the institute of international 
economics told the committee 
bush could have saved the worlds consumers about 40 billion by 
pumping 500000 barrels of oil a day from the emergency government 
stockpile into the market in august and september verleger said

asked about saddams offer to permit families of the hostages to 
visit thekm during thanksgiving and christmas bush said i see 
it as a ploy and said the visits should take home in the united 
states after the hostages are freed i dont think hell win the 
humanitarian of the year award for that he said reiterating 
government advice that americans not travel into iraq or occupied 
kuwait 
bush said he was speaking out so forcefully about the persian 
gulf so the american people would know where he stood after a month 
in which attention was diverted to budget deliberations with 
congress 
they must know how strongly i feel about the hostages and 
the treatment of the american diplomats who have been holed up in 
the us embassy for several weeks he said 
earlier white house spokesman fitzwater said the recent switch 
in emphasis had nothing to do with political motives or the 
beating bush had taken in public opinion over the recently 
concluded budget battle with congress he said bush was speaking 
more often and more forcefully about iraq to prepare the american 
people for any eventuality

global production of cocoa beans in the 
199091 marketing year is forecast at 239 million metric tons 
about the same as last season the agriculture department said 
thursday 
the departments foreign agricultural service said that would be 
about 3 percent below the record 198889 harvest of 247 million 
tons 
larger crops are expected for brazil malaysia and indonesia 
while most west african producers are anticipating smaller outturns 
because of less favorable growing conditions the agency said in 
its report 
production in the dominican republic is also expected to be 
down following a bumper 198990 harvest 
low world cocoa prices are discouraging most growers from 
making new plantings and providing adequate cultural practices to 
existing trees the report said however world production 
still remains at high levels as a significant number of young 
trees are reaching their maximum bearing age in the cote divoire 
and malaysia in addition to new plantings coming into bearing in 
indonesia 
world inventories of cocoa probably will be close to a record 
15 million tons by the end of the 199091 marketing year next 
sept 30 the report said

a parliamentary byelection is being closely 
watched for signs of voter attitudes toward prime minister toshiki 
kaifus leadership and his proposal to send japanese soldiers 
abroad for the first time since world war ii 
kaifu who has never had a strong power base in the governing 
liberal democratic party has been on shakier ground in recent 
weeks because of parliamentry opposition to his plan to send troops 
to the persian gulf 
the proposal known as the un peace cooperation bill would 
permit dispatching members of japans selfdefense forces for 
noncombat roles only 
the socialist party japans leading opposition group is 
seeking to make the dispute a central issue in sundays election of 
a legislator to japans upper house of parliament the election is 
in aichi in central japan kaifus home base 
a loss in his own prefecture would undoubtedly cast a shadow 
of questions on his leadership and harm his image said toshihiko 
kurachi secretary general of the liberal democratic party in 
aichi 
kaifu was chosen last summer to head the party and become prime 
minister when senior party leaders with stronger backing were under 
a cloud because of money and sex scandals 
his clean image and oratorical skills helped him win popular 
support and his party won lower house elections in february but 
senior party leaders also viewed those elections as giving them a 
clean slate and kaifus public support has eroded amid the troop 
controversy 
japans postworld war ii constitution bans the use of force to 
settle international disputes the opposition parties which 
control the upper house insist this rules out sending japanese 
troops abroad kaifu does not have solid support on the question 
even within his own party 
kaifu proposed sending troops in september after international 
criticism of japans failure to provide more than financial backing 
to the usled international force arrayed against iraq in the 
gulf iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
socialist party spokesman osamu yamaguchi said the group was 
urging aichi voters to show what the nation thinks about 
dispatching the selfdefense forces 
takeshi kataoka a lower house legislator from aichi who is a 
member of the governing party said his constituencys overwhelming 
opposition to sending troops to the gulf would not necessarily be 
reflected in a vote against the party 
people know the law is not going to lead to the draft as the 
opposition claims kataoka said 
the chunichi shimbun a newspaper in aichis major city of 
nagoya said that a voters poll showed 639 percent of respondents 
oppose sending troops the poll also indicated much lower voter 
interest in sundays election than in nationwide upper house 
elections last year when an unpopular sales tax and scandals 
affecting the governing party helped the opposition win control of 
the house 
as a result it is unlikely that kaifus government can win 
passage of the bill to send troops before the current session ends 
on nov 10 
the national newspaper asahi shimbun said a poll of 396 of the 
511 lower house members showed 223 opposed as long as the bill 
provides for sending troops abroad 
a majority in the poll however favored other steps to assist 
in middle east peace efforts such as financial backing or help for 
refugees the asahi saidjapan already has pledged 4 billion

perus government began distributing free and 
subsidized birth control pills and condoms on thursday marking a 
new era in this overwhelmingly roman catholic nation 
since it was announced on oct 23 by president alberto fujimori 
the birth control program has been harshly criticized by the 
catholic church fujimori has strongly defended the plan 
there is nothing terrible in not wanting more children eating 
trash in the streets fujimori said in a speech on wednesday 
he said the program was part of his governments efforts to 
combat the principal elements that generate unemployment poverty 
and hunger 
press reaction to the plan has been largely positive 
fujimoris birth control proposition may soon become a national 
consensus said an editorial in the magazine caretas 
once a virtually taboo subject birth control in the past week 
has become the national rage newspapers publish guides to devices 
and methods radio talk shows have become moral battlegrounds 
condoms are now a staple of political cartoons 
pills and condoms have been available for years in private 
pharmacies but public discussion of birth control has been minimal 
and sex education programs are almost nonexistent 
a health ministry spokesman confirmed thursday that the devices 
were being distributed by clinics throughout peru 
health minister carlos vidal layseca dubbed the minister of 
condoms by the press said last week the 12 million program is 
supported by the united nations 
in five years the government hopes to raise the percentage of 
peruvian women who understand birth control methods from 28 percent 
of the population to 45 percent he said 
the fight marks the second time the church has strongly 
criticized fujimori 
fujimoris political party is largely composed of members of 
perus small evangelical sects and the catholic church launched 
numerous attacks on the president in the weeks before he was 
elected june 10 
about 95 percent of peruvians are catholic although peru has no 
official religion 
the birth control battle has become largely a debate over how to 
eliminate poverty in peru where over half the population of 22 
million is poor the country is suffering from its worst economic 
crisis this century 
in announcing the plan fujimori said there was still time 
to avoid a population explosion in the country but peruvians 
must take corrective measures planning without fears or 
taboos he said 
he said his birth control program would cut annual population 
growth from 650000 people to 360000 within 10 years 
its very strange the government is worrying about children 
who have yet to be born and not about those who were already born 
and who are dying because of poverty and sickness monsignor luis 
bambaren said after the plan was announced 
monsignor ricardo durand flores president of the peruvian 
episcopal conference said birth control would lead to more 
sexual excess sexual licentiousness 
this in turn would lead to the use of abortion as a means of 
birth control he said

president mikhail s gorbachevs allies in the 
national legislature warned opposition groups thursday against 
holding counterdemonstrations on revolution day in red square 
we should be careful not to let this holiday be darkened by 
conflicts or clashes anatoly lukyanov speaker of the national 
supreme soviet warned in an interview on the nightly newscast 
vremya 
the resolution by the legislatures presidium run by lukyanov 
was not a formal ban on counter protests but it increased the 
pressure on an opposition coalition that called this week for an 
alternative rally nov 7 to protest the official parade the 
call led to speculation of clashes with police 
the parades celebrate communism and the ascent of the 
bolsheviks now called communists in 1917 they were turned into 
rolling displays of weaponry by josef stalin and traditionally also 
include a peoples demonstration of the citys residents 
while the official ideology has fallen from its sacred position 
in recent years the parades carry great weight in the country as a 
symbol of communist authority 
the liberal mayors of moscow and leningrad last month called for 
a boycott of the parades many of the 15 republics including the 
secessionist baltic states and restive caucasus republics voted to 
ban parades in their capital cities 
however gorbachev last month issued a presidential decree 
ordering the parades to be held in most major cities across the 
country and the national supreme soviet approved a special 
resolution echoing his order 
the staterun press has quoted generals as saying they planned 
to cary out gorbachevs order in their cities and moscows 
communist party leaders also promised to hold the traditional 
parade 
a poll published thursday night indicated most muscovites were 
against the celebration a survey of 2222 people in moscow from 
oct 2728 by the independent allunion center for public opinion 
found 29 percent supported the parade but 56 percent were against 
it according to the independent news agency interfax the rest 
said they were unsure 
the poll which gave no margin of error said elderly people and 
people without college educations were more likely than younger 
people and college graduates to support the parade as a celebration 
of the revolution interfax said 
the resolution thursday urged the opposition to hold its 
counterdemonstration on any day other than nov 78 the official 
dates of the anniversary 
soviets should celebrate the major state holiday in an 
atmosphere of calm consolidation and cooperation between all 
public forces in the country the resolution said according to 
the official news agency tass 
lukyanov in an apparent effort to deemphasize the communist 
aspect of the parade added in the television interview they 
ought to let this celebration be held as a holiday for national 
consolidation 
gorbachev speaking to a group of students thursday in the 
kremlin also called the holiday a global event and said he 
thought most of the country would celebrate the anniversary tass 
reported 
however plans for the parades were being assailed from all 
sides 
the ukrainian proindependence group rukh said thursday it 
planned an anticommunist protest next wednesday 
a leader of the russian nationalist organization pamyat said 
thursday his group would not mark the anniversary of a revolution 
that has led to a complete disintegration of the great state and 
to the murder of our legitimate monarch according to the 
independent postfactum news agency 
on may day this year another major soviet celebration tens of 
thousands of people marched in a mass counterdemonstration passed 
through red square many jeering gorbachev and shouting resign 
he withstood the catcalls for 20 minutes before leaving the 
reviewing stand

compliance with recommendations to the states on 
how to improve public health is lagging a survey released thursday 
showed 
the survey of health officials from all 50 states was conducted 
to determine how well they are implementing recommendations from 
the institute of medicine a government advisory group on public 
health 
the officials were in near unanimous agreement with many of 25 
proposals they were asked about but fewer than half had 
implemented the recommendations the federal centers for disease 
control said in a report on the survey conducted by an 
organization of state health officials 
for example 48 of 50 state health departments agreed their 
agencies should link with mental health services to improve the 
integration of service delivery only 13 had implemented such a 
plan eighteen said they planned to do so 
all 50 state agencies agreed the public should be better 
educated on community health needs and policy issues but only 34 
had a program in place to achieve that goal 
fortyfive of the agencies surveyed agreed they should develop 
comprehensive strategies to influence healthrelated behavior but 
only 21 had implemented a plan 
a recommendation that state health departments should be 
concerned with the publics exposure to toxins won unanimous 
agreement from the agencies only 33 had implemented a plan 
the institute of medicine said it made the recommendations 
because shortcomings in the nations public health system 
including inadequate resources and weak leadership limited 
availability of effective preventive health services in the united 
states 
dr arthur liang a cdc epidemiologist who wrote the agencys 
report on the survy said implementation has been slow in part 
because of a lack of government money 
some of it may be that we as a nation havent come to grips 
with what we expect of public health he said 
the recommendations were made in 1988 the survey was conducted 
in 1989 by the association of state and territorial health 
officials 
the cdc said legislation has been proposed to increase financial 
support to state and local health agencies to help them achieve 
public health objectives by the year 2000 
implementation of the recommendations wasnt so bleak in some 
areas

despite laws aimed at reducing lead in 
drinking water federal investigators believe hundreds of thousands 
of children continue to drink leadcontaminated water at school 
an internal report by the environmental protection agency said 
that states have failed to enforce requirements that schools test 
drinking water for lead and that the epa has not provided adequate 
guidance on what water coolers pose a health risk 
lead is a powerful poison even traces can be particularly 
harmful to children because it can hurt development of the brain 
and nervous system children under 7 are considered to be 
particularly vulnerable 
auditors in the epas inspector generals office estimated that 
based on a limited survey fewer than half of the school districts 
in the country may be testing thoroughly 
an examination of 13 school districts in the midatlantic region 
revealed that three had not tested for lead while most of the 
others conducted inadequate tests 
our findings confirm that harmful amounts of lead exist in the 
drinking water provided by schools both the epa and the states 
must be more aggressive in eliminating the health hazard imposed by 
lead in drinking water said the report from the inspector 
generals office made available by the agency thursday 
the investigation was concluded last april with the report 
completed in september agency officials said 
three of the school districts pittsburgh richmond va and 
charleston wva had not tested for lead at the time of the 
survey 
the other 10 school districts were philadelphia and chester in 
pennsylvania baltimore and montgomery county in maryland 
huntington and jackson in west virginia alexandria caroline 
county and fairfax county in virginia and washington dc 
many schools were either not testing their water or if they 
were testing may have been testing improperly said the report 
the epa considers lead concentrations above 20 parts per billion 
to be hazardous to school children the report said that the agency 
believes every year more than 250000 children are exposed to lead 
level in drinking water that are high enough to impair their 
intellectual and physical development 
there are about 44 million youngsters in the nations schools 
336 million in kindergarten and the elementary grades 
nationwide only minnesota requires local school officials and 
day care centers to test their drinking water for lead the 
auditors said other states only recommend such tests 
congress passed a law in 1988 that requires epa to issue testing 
guidelines and provide help to schools for the tests 
the report blamed both the epa and states for lack of vigor 
while there are an estimated 600 different models of water 
coolers that have lead components and therefore pose a health 
hazard the epa so far has identified only 33 such models in 
guidelines to school districts a number of the schools surveyed 
had limited their test programs to only coolers singled out by the 
epa the auditors said 
the epa auditors found that coolers on the epa warning list were 
found to be operating in seven of the 10 school districts where 
testing had been done four of the districts had coolers that were 
not on the epa list but were providing contaminated water six of 
the school districts had drinking water contaminated because of 
lead in fountains and plumbing 
at one school 15 coolers were tested and all 15 exceeded 20 
parts per billion said the report drinking water was found in 
five of the school districts that had lead levels in excess of 100 
ppb or five times the levels considered safe for children 
they did not identify the schools 
the report attributed many of the shortcomings to school 
officials not having the money to conduct tests it noted that 
while the 1988 lead contamination control act authorized 30 
million a year to help schools test none of that money so far has 
been appropriated by congress

here is the text of president bushs news 
conference thursday 
president bush let me just make a brief statement and then ill 
be glad to respond to questions 
i want to begin today by simply restating for the american 
people some of the key points about our efforts to turn back 
aggression in the persian gulf 
i believe that it is essential that the american people fully 
understand the objectives of the united states and the united 
nations as well as the magnitude of the outrage perpetrated by the 
government of iraq 
the united states and the rest of the world are united in the 
condemnation of iraqs invasion of kuwait we have no quarrel with 
the iraqi people our problem is with iraqis dictator saddam 
hussein 
i want a peaceful resolution to this crisis were giving the 
united nations sanctions imposed on iraq time to work but let me 
be very clear there will be no compromise on the stated objectives 
of the united nations security council resolutions 
iraqs brutality against innocent civilians will not be 
permitted to stand and saddam husseins violations of 
international law will not stand his aggression against kuwait 
will not stand 
and now id be glad to take questions i think tom you have 
the first one 
q yes mr president inaudible say that your comments in 
recent days have been aimed at least in part in preparing the 
american people for the possibility of war is that true and do 
you think the american people are ready that they have no problems 
with it

here are excerpts from sir geoffrey howes letter 
of resignation as deputy prime minister and the response from 
prime minister margaret thatcher 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
letter from howe 
it gives me all the more sadness to acknowledge the growing 
difference which has emerged between us on the increasingly 
important issue of britains role in europe 
as much as you i have wanted to make the most of britains 
influence in the world to deploy britains sovereignty to the best 
advantage of our people ever since our original application to 
join the european community in 1962 that has clearly involved 
britains firm practical commitment to the historic process of 
closer european partnership 
my vision of europe has always been practical and hardheaded i 
am not a euroidealist or federalist my concern is less with grand 
schemes than with immediate realities as they affect our 
wellbeing and prospects as a nation like you i have fought too 
many european battles in a minority of one to harbor any illusions 
on that score 
our conduct of policy on the crucial monetary issue in europe 
first on erm the exchange rate mechanism and now on emu european 
monetary union has given me increasing grounds for concern 
we mst be at the center of the european partnership playing 
the sort of leading and constructive role which commands respect 
we need to be able to persuade friends as well as challenge 
opponents and to win arguments before positions become entrenched 
 
i am deeply anxious that the mood you have struck most notably 
in rome last weekend and in the house of commons this tuesday 
will make it more difficult for britain to hold and retain a 
position of influence in this vital debate 
of course there are still huge questions to be considered and 
resolved in this discussion none of us wants the imposition of a 
single currency but more than one form of emu european monetary 
union is possible 
the important thing is not to rule in or out any one particular 
solution absolutely we should be in the business not of isolating 
ourselves unduly but of offering positive alternatives that can 
enable us to be seriously engaged 
cabinet government is all about trying to persuade one another 
from within so too within the unique partnership of nations that 
is making the european community plain speaking certainly but 
matched always by mutual respect and restraint in pursuit of a 
common cause 
the need to find and maintain common ground on the european 
issue within our own party will be crucial to our electoral success 
and the future of the nation in all honesty i now find myself 
unable to share your view of the right approach to this question 
on that basis i do not believe that i can any longer serve with 
honor as a member of your government 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
letter from mrs thatcher 
your letter refers to differences between us on europe i do 
not believe these are nearly as great as you suggest we are at one 
in wishing to preserve the fundamental sovereignty of parliament 
we want britain to play a leading part in europe and to be part of 
the further political economic and monetary development of the 
european community 
as i made clear in my statement to the house our aim is to find 
solutions which will enable the community to go forward as twelve 
i believe the party is united behind these aims and demonstrated 
that very clearly in the house on tuesday we have always been the 
party of europe and will continue to be so

some jewish leaders said president bush 
overstated the case when he suggested thursday that saddam hussein 
had surpassed adolf hitler in at least one form of brutality one 
called it an unfortunate exaggeration another a slip of the 
tongue 
but several said saddamhitler comparisons were apt to a certain 
extent and one said he thought the president was just using an 
understandable figure of speech 
bush speaking at a republican rally in mashpee mass said the 
iraqi leaders forces have committed outrageous acts of 
barbarism 
and he said american hostages were being held in direct 
contravention of international law many of them reportedly staked 
out as human shields near possible military targets brutality that 
i dont believe adolf hitler ever participated in 
later at a news conference in orlando fla bush said i 
dont think i am overstating it i know i am not overstating the 
feelings i have about it 
rabbi abraham cooper associate director of the simon wiesenthal 
center in los angeles said saddam hussein has a list of crimes 
that i dont think has to be compared with anybody in order for the 
people of america to understand how serious a threat he 
represents 
cooper said he believed there were comparisons that could be 
made between the iraqi president and the world war ii german 
dictator whose regime resulted in the extermination of about 6 
million jews 
but lets also keep this thing in some sort of perspective 
he said and to say that he outstrips adolf hitler i just think 
its either a slip of the tongue or a speech writer got carried 
away no one yet and i hope no one ever will match up to the 
systematized brutalities and racist policies that adolf hitler 
committed 
abraham foxman national director of the antidefamation league 
of bnai brith called bushs remark an unfortunate exaggeration 
that could hurt the presidents credibility at a time when it is 
very important that he remain credible 
saddam hussein is writing his own chapter of barbarism 
foxman said its the saddam hussein chapter and one need not 
compare or exaggerate 
elan steinberg executive director of the world jewish congress 
asked about the presidents remark said i think he is being 
figurative in using hitler as the supreme standard or measure of 
brutality in a figurative sense we understand why he is making 
the comparison to hitler i dont think even president bush means 
to make the literal comparison as to who is more evil

producer joseph papp turned down 323000 in 
grants from the national endowment for the arts on thursday the 
second time this year he has refused money from the federal 
government 
in a letter to nea chairman john frohnmayer papp who heads the 
new york shakespeare festival public theater said the festival 
found the new legislation for the continuance of the national 
endowment for the arts punitive and an infringement on the civil 
rights of artists and arts institutions 
the money would have been used for the festivals theater and 
musictheater programs 
papps action came despite the neas decision last month to drop 
its policy of requiring grant recipients to sign a pledge saying 
they would not violate restrictions imposed by congress on 
obscenity 
what this means financially is a substantial increase in our 
problems as an institution to raise additional funds papp told 
reporters the public has a yearly budget of some 14 million and 
has been able to raise about 12 million each year to cover costs 
that still leaves a deficit of about 2 million that must be erased 
each year he said 
in april papp rejected a 50000 grant from the endownment to 
help underwrite the festival latino a monthlong program of latin 
american theater music and films at the public theater

a tom i want to have a peaceful resolution to this question 
and our dealing through the united nations and working with them 
for common objectives i think is evidence of that 
ive indicated were prepared to give sanctions time to work 
and ill repeat that here again today but i am not ruling out 
further options and im not trying to prepare our country for war 
we have a little bit of a hiatus because of the attention on 
the budget and other matters from keeping in focus our objectives 
in iraq theres been a little less attention to it in some 
quarters and i want to in a sense tom its a little bit 
awkward because here we are just a few days before an election and 
i want to continue to work for republican candidates but i must 
continue to keep our objectives regarding iraq in focus and so 
what i try to do is separate out the foreign affairs the iraq 
question from domestic politics 
but it is essential that i do the latter but it is not in 
doing that i am not trying to sound the tocsin of war but i am 
trying to point out the concerns that i feel for example on the 
hostage question and ill continue to do that 
q do you think the american people though sir are ready for 
war 
a well i dont i think the american people feel as i do 
that theyd much prefer to have a peaceful resolution of this 
question but who can tell what would happen in a situation of this 
nature theres a lot of unforeseen things that can take place and 
i think i would have to go to the american people with my 
recommendations if it regarded the safety or defense of our key 
interests yeah 
q mr president mr president you said today 
a sorry 
q i know you said that saddam hussein was even more brutal than 
adolf hitler talking about starving out the americans in the 
embassy in kuwait city is there a chance that you might be 
exaggerating a bit for effect and coming just one week before the 
election i know you said that you keep these separate but 
youre making these statements on the bandstand with your political 
party behind you if you really want to keep these separate why 
dont you just address the nation in some other forum 
a well im addressing it in another forum now and this is in 
a nationally covered press conference im sure i dont i dont 
think im overstating it i know im not overstating the feelings i 
have about it 
the reports coming out of iraq just today cause even further 
concern these reports of the way our innocent civilians are being 
treated i think the american people are as outraged as i am about 
the treatment of the people in our embassy for example and i think 
its important that they know my concerns on this subject 
so i dont i dont the last question that you raise does 
concern me some but it is very important that i keep pointing out 
the objectives and where i think iraq stands 
all the people were addressing are extraordinarily interested 
in that and i go to great ends to make sure that i give proper 
credit to the democrats and the republicans in congress make clear 
that this is not a partisan effort that were involved in here i 
have been very gratified for the enormous support from both houses 
of congress and from the american people 
but i as we continue to move forces and as we see the various 
events taking place over there i think it is important that the 
president continue to spell out for the american people not only 
our objectives but telling them how i feel about the various 
events 
q mr president are you one followup are you considering 
now a reprovisioning mission of some sort 
a well i am hopeful still that the united nations resolutions 
that call for reprovisioning will be followed and id rather leave 
it there but i am very concerned about the people in that embassy 
its cut off from food they have enough right now but the 
whole whole ploy by saddam hussein is to starve them out and i 
think that is unconscionable and i think the world needs to know 
how strongly those of us in the united states responsible for this 
policy feel about it 
q mr president apart from the distraction that may have been 
caused by the budget battle what other factors have caused you to 
approach this task of readdressing this issue with such urgency

moldavian nationalist leaders on thursday blasted 
the kremlins deployment of security forces in the embattled 
republic and demanded un peacekeeping troops replace the soviet 
soldiers news reports said 
the moldavian popular front asked the republic to declare 
immediate and unconditional secession from the ussr and press 
for the withdrawal of all soviet troops from the territory of the 
republic and suspension of the activity of kgb bodies according 
to a statement reported by the official news agency tass 
the statement said the legislature also must ask the united 
nations to introduce its troops into moldavia for a period 
determined by the republic leadership tass reported 
the front a leading nationalist group has been caught in the 
middle of a secessionist battle between the gagauz minority and the 
government of moldavia a republic of 43 million bordering 
romania 
the gagauz minority a christian people numbering about 150000 
and living mostly in the southern corner of the republic declared 
sovereignty last week and began holding elections for its own 
government they claim moldavia has been discriminating against 
minorities in the republic during its own drive for independence 
bands of moldavian nationalists rushed to the area to oppose the 
gagauz triggering the deployment of two interior ministry 
regiments last weekend 
the first violence came wednesday when moldavians attacked the 
frontier with romania threatening to kill guards and their 
families unless soviet forces withdraw tass reported 
the militants gave up no casualties were reported 
similar separatists movements have sprouted nationwide and are 
hampering gorbachevs efforts to negotiate a union treaty that 
would solidify ties among divergent peoples and regions 
gagauz representatives have been negotiating with a joint 
moldaviansoviet committee trying to resolve the standoff in the 
gagauz districts both sides agreed to pull back their defenders 
mostly youths armed reportedly with sticks and metal rods and 
allow the security forces to establish a buffer 
the gagauz also have postponed their elections for an 
independent government during the negotiations 
the popular fronts statement also urged the parliament in 
neighboring romania whose people share a common language and 
culture with moldavians to immediately consider giving 
assistance to romanians who are discriminated against by the 
ussr the independent postfactum news agency reported 
romanian president ion iliescu said in an interview on austrian 
television wednesday that romania would not seek to alter its 
border with moldavia tass reported

the california supreme court discarded a 
ban thursday on legislative fund raising in nonelection years and 
raised the stakes for competing ballot measures in next weeks 
election 
the court said that when two rival measures are on the same 
ballot and get majority votes the one with more votes takes effect 
and the other cannot be enforced 
the 52 ruling voided what remained of proposition 68 a 
campaign finance initiative for legislative candidates that was 
approved in 1988 by 53 percent of the voters proposition 73 a 
milder campaign finance measure on the same ballot got 58 percent 
the court rejected arguments by common cause and other groups 
backing proposition 68 they maintained parts of the measure that 
did not expressly conflict with proposition 73 could be salvaged 
an overall limit on contributions to legislative candidates and a 
ban on fund raising during nonelection years 
contribution limits in proposition 73 were ruled 
unconstitutional by a federal judge but were allowed to remain in 
effect for legislative races until appeals were resolved 
thursdays ruling could affect several sets of competing 
initiatives on tuesdays ballot wiping out all provisions of a 
measure that passed by a majority but got fewer votes than a 
conflicting measure 
for example propositions 131 and 140 contain rival sets of term 
limits for officeholders but each also contains other provisions 
voluntary spending limits and partial public financing of campaigns 
in proposition 131 and a cut in the legislatures budget in 
proposition 140 
propositions 130 and 138 regulating logging and propositions 
128 and 135 affecting pesticides also could be affected 
when a second measure is directed to the same subject and 
offered as a competing regulatory scheme only the provisions of 
the measure receiving the highest affirmative vote are operative 
justice david eagleson wrote 
lower courts had interpreted state law to require comparison of 
each provision of rival initiatives to decide whether parts of a 
measure receiving fewer votes could be enforced separately 
eagleson rejected that approach as judicial legislation 
justice stanley mosk in a separate opinion said patching 
together parts of two competing initiatives could create a 
frankensteins monster whose existence the voters never 
contemplated 
but dissenting justice joyce kennard joined by justice allen 
broussard said the approach the court rejected was required by 
state law 
the ruling does not become final for at least 30 days it would 
not appear to affect fundraising for legislative candidates in 
next weeks election currently governed by proposition 73

a well were getting you know the sand is running through 
the glass and weve got these economic sanctions in play and i 
think theres an urgency on the part of people to understand 
desire on their part rather to understand whether the sanctions 
are working we continue to move force and i think its important 
that the american people know why im continuing to do this 
and so i think its just rather that there was a period where i 
didnt do as much of it but now im going to keep on now and on 
past the election as well 
q mr president i know you say that youre not trying to 
prepare the american people for war but could not your message of 
today and this week be summed up as that you are seeking a peaceful 
resolution if possible but a military one if not 
a well i think that ive made those statements before i think 
ive been rather consistent in pointing out that i would not rule 
anything out if you go back and look at the things ive said i 
believe ive been on the record before with that kind of comment 
brit 
q mr president saddam hussein today invited american families 
to come visit the hostages over the next holiday the twopart 
question sir is would you welcome such visits by americans and 
what do you make of that kind of offer to them 
a i think its a well let me start i think that those people 
should come home to visit with their families i think they should 
be released from captivity 
this canard of calling people that are held hostage calling 
them guests when theyre hostages is turning off the whole 
world 
and further the reports that are coming out from some of these 
french hostages coming home of their understanding of the way the 
americans are being treated is just terrible and the whole concept 
of staking out people for next to what might become military 
targets is also unconscionable so i see it as a ploy but i dont 
think hell win the humanitarian of the year award for that i 
think that people see it as a rather brutal toying with the 
emotions of families frankly charlie 
q inaudible 
a i would we have a notice out that we are discouraging 
americans from going there and that would hold 
q mr president you said on one occasion that your patience is 
running out that youve had it youre telling us on this occasion 
youre willing to wait and see if the sanctions work 
weve see your senior staff out today inaudible 
consistency but yet there seems to be a variance there are you 
having trouble getting your message across 
a no and i dont think theres any inconsistency and if youd 
like i dont want to take up your time but thinking i might get 
a question of this nature i wrote down the various things that 
ive said on this subject for some time and they are quite 
consistent 
one time you might have a little more emphasis on one point 
like yesterday on the outrage i feel about the hostages at another 
you might have a little more emphasis on having the sanctions work 
but i think we have been extraordinarily consistent and i think 
our i think the key point on this regarding substance is that our 
allies understand this they know exactly where the united states 
stands in terms of our determination to see the united nations 
sanctions fulfilled so im not worried about it 
there was one story today that was you know just clearly wrong 
in that regard but i think weve had a rather consistent approach 
to this very consistent and so i dont worry about that and i 
the key point would be if our allies thought that and they dont 
or saddam hussein thought that and he doesnt he cant 
q id like to just follow up before you were concerned about 
an erosion within your alliance inaudible saddam hussein may 
be successful in trying to keep apart inaudible 
a i know hes going to continue to try to do that charles 
hes doing it every way he can he did it first an interesting 
point he contacted his people contacted a parliamentarian in 
canada roughly the same day they contacted the foreign minister of 
germany roughly the time they contacted a member of parliament in 
the united kingdom and the whole concept was you come well 
parcel out some hostages trying to divide and show a 
humanitarian side of some sort 
he continues to through the primakov visit i think his 
concept there was to try to find some division and i dont think 
that division exists but it does concern me that he not be 
successful 
and thats why i think it is important that the united states 
continue to reiterate our conviction on seeing that there can be no 
compromise with this aggression and that these united nations 
resolutions must be fulfilled in their entirety yeah

beaches of iraqioccupied kuwait 
it was the second such major exercise for the us navy and

part had been successfully accomplished said lt kevin 
wensing a spokesman for command naval forces central command

training exercise in the north arabian sea from oct 30 to nov 8 
the exercise he said involved surface and heliborne 
operations on a remote beachhead in which 20 fixedwing aircraft

the purpose is to continue navy and marine corps training in 
amphibious landing skills and to familiarize these forces with the 
desert environment he said

it is known the first exercise took place somewhere off oman

region declined further detail on the marine exercise but stressed 
the accident was not in any way affecting the amphibious task 
force 
the iwo jima is one of amphibious task force ships assigned to 
assist operation desert shield preparing to storm kuwait from sea 
if the military option is decided to try to end saddam husseins 
occupation 
there are 46000 marine corps personnel deployed in the task

congressional incumbents had a huge 20to1 
money advantage over their challengers heading into the final push 
of this years election campaign the federal election commission 
said thursday 
incumbents in house and senate races had a combined 120 million 
in cash on hand compared to just 6 million for the challengers 
according to federal election disclosure forms for the period 
ending oct 17 
overall 303 million had been spent on the congressional 
elections through that date 2 percent less than in the comparable 
period two years ago and just slightly more than in 1986 
the fec data included all candidates even those without 
competitive elections 
an analysis of the data on senate races by common cause showed 
that the the 27 senate incumbents who have majorparty challengers 
had a combined 239 million in the bank the challengers had 35 
million 
those incumbents raked in more money in part because of a 4to1 
edge in donations from political action committees and they have 
outspent the challengers through oct 17 by 997 million to 34 
million 
not surprisingly only a handful of the 32 incumbents who sought 
reelection this year are at risk of losing their seats 
the election process will not be competitive as long as the 
huge financial gap continues between incumbents and challengers 
said common cause president fred wertheimer common cause supports 
public financing of elections 
the fattest senate campaign chest as of oct 17 was that of sen 
phil gramm rtexas with 526 million next was sen bill 
bradley dnj with 235 million neither was considered in 
political trouble 
the most expensive senate contest is in north carolina where 
incumbent republican jesse helms spent 108 million through oct 
17 defending his seat from democratic challenger harvey gantt 
gantt the former mayor of charlotte spent 46 million 
overall 134 million has been spent on this years senate 
races through oct 17 all candidates had raised 151 million 
compared with 157 million in the similar period for the 1988 
elections 
in the house 206 million has been raised this time compared 
to 202 million two years ago 169 million of that has been spent 
this year compared to 165 million in the same period in the 1988 
elections 
several house incumbents had more than 1 million in reserve 
even though they had no serious opposition

the spectre of phillyphobia is haunting 
democratic legislative candidates as republicans scare taxpayers by 
telling them a vote against the gop is a vote for a bailout of the 
states largest city 
electing democrats will mean dumping millions of state dollars 
into philadelphias supposed fiscal black hole republicans across 
pennsylvania contend 
as far away as erie in the states northwest republican harry 
bowser who was bounced from his house seat two years ago by 
democrat thomas scrimenti is mounting a campaign of revenge he 
says scrimenti is a lackey of the philadelphia house leadership 
house speaker robert odonnell a democrat is from 
philadelphia 
earlier this week house minority whip samuel hayes said a 
democratic candidate in lancaster would be like an orange ready 
to be squeezed by philadelphia lawmakers seeking money for their 
beleaguered city 
in crawford county incumbent rep connie maines opponent 
republican teresa brown is saying maine has voted for philadelphia 
politicians and that when it comes time for a bailout shell do it 
again 
pennsylvania politicians have long practiced philly bashing as 
an easy way to lay blame for problems and threaten voters that 
this could happen here they complain that the states biggest 
city gets it all while the little guy goes without 
but this year with increasing regularity the question of 
whether a lawmaker voted in favor of legislation to benefit 
philadelphia supported philadelphia lawmakers or was backed by 
philadelphia lawmakers is turning into a major election issue 
philadelphia faces a 206 million deficit in the fiscal year 
that ends next june 30 mayor w wilson goode has frozen hiring and 
delayed pension fund payments and tax refunds but the city expects 
to go broke by dec 1 
few taxes can be raised or added without state approval and its 
wage tax already is among the nations highest standard amp poors 
has lowered the citys bond rating to ccc 
officials from both sides of the legislative aisle say 
phillyphobia is a good way to win votes especially when 
candidates try to link their opponents with philadelphias 
financial problems and charge theyll send taxpayers money to help 
rescue the city 
jack stollsteimer aide to odonnell said the divide and 
conquer strategy usually means the candidate doesnt have much 
else to attack 
its on a much larger scale than its ever been done in the 
past its much more orchestrated stollsteimer said 
republicans use the tactic to scare voters into thinking that 
supporting democrats will mean a spread of philadelphias liberal 
democratic thinking he said 
both sides are trying to win the middle class and the 
republicans always try to say that the democrats represent them 
the lower class poor people black people not us the middle 
class voters stollsteimer said with the citys financial 
trouble they think they have an issue that plays to peoples worse 
fears

amnesty international announced thursday it is 
asking saudi king fahd to investigate allegations that his security 
forces have tortured and otherwise mistreated hundreds of yemenis 
the yemenis are being forced out of saudi arabia in retaliation 
for yemens position on the persian gulf crisis yemen is widely 
seen as a tacit supporter of iraq which it has been reluctant to 
condemn for the aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
in its statement in london the international human rights group 
said the yemeni victims were among the thousands of yemeni 
nationals who were rounded up in the space of a month 
the group said the roundup expulsions and ill treatment were 
for no apparent reason other than their nationality or their 
suspected opposition to the saudi arabian governments position in 
the gulf crisis 
at least 400000 yemenis left saudi arabia between late 
september and late october 
more than half the yemeni population in saudi arabia already 
has left the country we dont want those still in the country to 
suffer the same abuses amnesty said 
yemens foreign minister abd alkarim aliryani said in an 
interview last month that the expulsions were intended to cripple 
his nations fledgling government he said the saudis hope the 
deluge of refugees will overwhelm yemen 
the yemenis in saudi arabia send remittances home those funds 
constitute about onethird of the gross national product of yemen 
the country which is at the tip of the arabian peninsula is 
one of the poorest in the arab world it was created in may by the 
unification of prowestern north yemen with sovietallied south 
yemen 
on sept 18 saudi authorities withdrew special status for the 
12 million yemenis in the kingdom including many who lived there 
more than 30 years they were given about two months to find a 
saudi sponsor or go home 
the saudis have invited us and other national forces onto 
their soil to counter iraqs army which is just across the kuwaiti 
border 
in addition to appealing to king fahd a representative of 
amnesty international raised the groups concerns about torture 
detention and arrests last week with the saudi arabian ambassador 
in washington dc the statement said 
we want the government to ensure that the investigation is 
carried out amnesty said it said the inquiry should be public 
in the groups release the saudi government was quoted as 
saying it did not believe there had been any widespread 
violation of its policy of treating yemenis with affection and 
dignity saudi authorities said they would look at the 
information submitted by amnesty the statement said 
however there was no public comment from the saudis 
an amnesty research team in yemen spent several days 
interviewing people crossing from saudi arabia and collected 
information on 800 people arrested and detained including many who 
had been tortured or mistreated the statement said 
the team saw some people with torture marks the statement said 
the group interviewed a man who had been beaten so badly he had to 
be hospitalized the researchers said yemenis reported beatings on 
the feet near suffocation and sleep deprivation according to the 
statement 
most of those interviewed said that after they were arrested 
saudi officials asked them if they supported yemens position in 
the gulf crisis

q mr president in the beginning of this crisis you held out 
little hope for a diplomatic solution today 
a did you say a little hope or little hope 
q little hope for a diplomatic solution today you talk about 
hoping that theres a peaceful resolution im just wondering are 
we any closer to possibly having a diplomatic solution 
a i dont see that i dont see that we are 
ive said from the very beginning i hoped that the sanctions 
would have an effect that would cause him to comply with the 
resolutions 
i think theyre having an effect but our problem is and the 
problem of our allies around the world is we cant certify for the 
world how disastrous or strong an effect these sanctions are 
having 
but from the very beginning ive been saying i would hope that 
the sanctions would be effective and well give them time again 
my problem is and the problem with those with whom i consult very 
closely is we cant say how much is enough in terms of the 
sanctions or how much time it would take 
q well sir if you do not expect a diplomatic solution but 
youre hoping for a peaceful resolution does that mean you expect 
saddam will just give up 
a thats what i would like to see yeah thats what the united 
nations calls for calls for him to withdraw calls for the 
restoration of the rulers and so thats exactly what he ought to 
do 
and i think if we hold firm and we are holding firm in this 
coalition with some 25 countries in the gulf or on the sea there 
plus the solidarity that the united nations has demonstrated i 
think hell eventually you know the hope is eventually he might 
do that but we cant guarantee to the american people how long 
will it take yeah 
q sir your wife was campaigning in omaha today and i dont 
know if youve seen reports about that she was asked if you would 
consider meeting face to face with saddam hussein and replied 
quote i think he would consider anything to get the kuwaitis 
back in their own country and get inaudible 
that is being interpreted that you would consider a oneonone 
meeting with saddam would you 
a i would consider it without if there was an agreement that 
he would totally withdraw and comply fully with no conditions to 
the united nations sanctions 
i mean i think anybody would do that but that would mean that 
he has to do exactly what ive been saying here with no condition 
no negotiation just leave but i dont at that juncture that it 
would be much of a pleasant meeting 
but i never thats something that i guess barbara was asked on 
her own ive not discussed it with her or anybody else but thats 
the only way that it would be productive for me to have a meeting 
it seems to me because there is no flexibility on our position 
there is no compromise there is no conditionality my position 
and i think it strongly represents the coalition partners 
position is he must comply and so i dont think a meeting short 
of just acceptance of those terms would be in the national interest 
or in the interest of the coalition yeah 
q i have a question 
a yes sir john and 
q about the selfserving skepticism inaudible speaking 
out on iraq its not just because of the elections inaudible 
its also because of the signals weve been getting about the 
embassy in kuwait had plenty of food and water for the time being 
the ambassador the dutch ambassadors wife said tuesday morning 
on one of these morning television programs that they were planting 
vegetables there that they have a well there all seems to be 
going well all of a sudden the next day were inaudible 
what caused this change 
a i dont think it is a change ive been increasingly 
concerned about it im delighted to know about the vegetables 
thats the first time ive heard of that and ive known that 
theyve had enough tuna fish for some time 
there was earlier estimates that the embassy would have to be 
closed before now and theyve stretched the time frame there 
but its that plus the reports coming out of iraq that make me 
feel i must keep this in focus for the american people they must 
know how strongly i feel about an american embassy the american 
flag flying and these people inside being cut off and i would say 
brutalized by that behavior and secondly how strongly i feel 
about the americans that are held hostage in iraq itself 
and it is essential that we not lose track of that of those 
key points these people are not guests they are hostages and i 
think there hasnt been i think youre on to something because i 
dont think there has been that much discussion lately of these 
things that really concern me john these matters concern me 
deeply yeah

q mr president a political question if youre inaudible 
for clayton williams inaudible is there any inaudible 
that at this stage of the game due to the fact that inaudible 
a well im not familiar with the details of that i am 
strongly in favor of clayton williams over his opponent not just 
for personal reasons either and dont ask me for a review of the 
ballot items yet i will be voting down there tuesday and take a 
look at them and dont ask the people of california where they 
dont have one but they have i dont know how many on there of 
these referendum items on the ballots 
so im not troubled by that because what i see in clayton 
william sic is a person that will be a very good strong governor 
for the state and i am enthusiastically for him and im not even 
familiar with the details of the amendment you know the ballot 
item youre talking about 
yeah 
q mr president inaudible mr quayle said yesterday that 
the united states must inaudible iraqs chemical 
psychological and nuclear inaudible 
a well i think from the very beginning an objective we 
spelled out some objective but one that i think has been clearly 
spelled out has been ensuring the security and the stability of the 
gulf and that obviously is affected by the possession of these 
chemical and biological weapons and things of that nature so i 
dont think that the goalposts are being moved 
i think its just simply a statement of reality 
if youre going to have a stable and youre going to have a 
secure gulf after kuwait is freed and the iraqis have withdrawn 
their invasion youre going to have to have some arrangements im 
sure i think others would agree with this around the world that 
guarantee the peace there 
and i would hope that as ive said early i want all united 
nations united states forces out of there as soon as possible 
every single soldier and its important i keep repeating that 
because theres this the allegations by some over in that part of 
the world that we want to keep forces there thats not what we 
want to do we want to come out but there has got to be some 
security arrangements worked out absolutely 
q mr president just to make sure i understand what youre 
saying the united states and this international force we have 
cannot successfully leave first of all until we have secured in 
some manner the off mike 
a oh no i wouldnt say that but there have to be some 
security arrangements that guarantee against a future aggression of 
this nature yeah maureen 
q mr president you said today that saddam hussein had 
committed atrocities that were reminiscent of adolf hitler could 
you tell us what hussein has done that compares with the holocaust 
a worse than what compares with what hitler has done 
q with the holocaust 
a yeah go back and well i didnt say the holocaust 
q well you said 
a i mean that is outrageous but i think brutalizing young 
kids in a square in kuwait is outrageous too 
and i think if you go back and look at what happened when the 
deaths head regiments went into poland youll find an awful 
similarity 
i was told and weve got to check this carefully that hitler 
did not stake people out against potential military targets and 
that he did indeed respect not much else but he did indeed 
respect the legitimacy of the embassies so weve got some 
differences here but im talking when im talking about there 
i see many similarities incidentally 
i see many similarities by the way the iraqi forces behaved in 
kuwait and the deaths head regiments behaved in poland go back 
and take a look at your history and youll see why im as concerned 
as i am yeah 
q mr president youve spoken out about the brutality against 
the socalled the hostages in iraq however theres a report 
today by amnesty international that there has been some of our own 
allies the saudi arabians have been guilty of committing some 
kind of atrocities at least torturing some citizens of yemen who 
are in their country what do you say to that and will you put any 
pressure on them to change their ways

president bush yes i think i did i have not seen that and i 
dont think that i think that violations of individuals rights 
or torture should not take place and ill be glad to represent 
that 
q how do you feel though about the united states helping 
someone whos doing the same sort of things as youre criticizing 
the iraqis for 
a i feel that im delighted that we are there with the saudi 
arabians to stand up against this kind of aggression 
international aggression in violation of international law and 
that is the question and thats where im going to keep my focus 
because it is very important one that saudi arabia be 
defended 
and i think now i think that we can certify that iraq does not 
have the capacity to invade saudi arabia and secondly we are 
united with saudi arabia in our determination to overthrow this 
aggression yeah 
q secretary baker is going to meet shevardnadze in europe in 
the next few days is that because you cant stand that the soviet 
union is drifting in the gulf strategy or is it because of their 
their appeal behind the scenes after primakovs visit in baghdad 
or is it only because you want to push the start treaty 
a well weve got a broad agenda of items 
weve got to finish up cfe we want to move start towards 
conclusion we have these common interests that youre asking about 
in the gulf and then we have economic problems that we discuss all 
the time so therell be a broad agenda in the meetings with 
shevardnadze 
and im sure that one of them will be a discussion of the 
primakov visit to iraq and the primakov visit that preceded that 
to egypt and the primakov visit that followed that to saudi 
arabia 
so id but the mission if i understand the question is not 
simply to focus on this gulf question because we i am anxious to 
get these other matters resolved the cfe is all but put to bed but 
theres a tiny technical matter thats i think well hopefully 
its been resolved by now but its a broad agenda 
q so youre not concerned that the soviet union is drifting in 
the gulf strategy 
a no i dont and i think one point that we ought to keep 
reminding the american people of is that we are very fortunate in 
wrestling with this problem of international aggression that the 
soviet union and china have been with us or weve been with them 
however we want to look at it in the united nations as we try to 
bring international pressure to bear and have brought it to bear 
yeah 
q mr president in your inaudible this morning you were 
a lot softer on the democrats than youve been in recent days now 
why the change of heart 
a its not a change of heart its a question of i think ive 
made my point but ill have a shot at them here as we get into the 
depending how warmed up i get today campaigning enthusiastically 
for governor martinez and id like to finish on a positive note 
for in these campaigns but i think its a little early to say 
that there will be no more flamboyant rhetoric about the democrats 
because im absolutely convinced if we had more republicans things 
would be a lot better yeah michelle and then ann 
q mr president early in the course of this the persian gulf 
crisis you said that you would not allow hostagetaking to dictate 
your policy you said that would endanger every american because 
every american would then be subject to being held hostage 
your comments today seem to change that it seems to highlight 
their situation have you changed your mind about the importance of 
highlighting hostages the hostages in this crisis 
a i know i dont i want to be sure i understand your 
question im not sure i understand it on highlighting 
hostages what i think i said before was hostagetaking punishes 
the innocent and separates families back in september it is 
barbaric it will not work sept 16th and it will not affect my 
ability to make tough decisions 
now there are other quotes here but so i want to be sure i 
understand you see because what i think some are picking up is 
theres a different emphasis but i think is that one in accord 
with what youre asking about

a man claiming to be a kuwaiti 
resistance member who survived three weeks in an iraqi prison said 
thursday that prisoners are being tortured and killed to break 
their opposition to saddam hussein 
he told a news conference organized by kuwaits 
governmentinexile he escaped and spent three days hiding in 
kuwait before making his way across the desert and across the 
border to saudi arabia he said would not describe his method of 
escape in order to protect those who helped him 
the young man who spoke on the basis of anonymity said he was 
arrested sept 20 and held 23 days he said he was raped by iraqi 
soldiers and hanged upside down for hours from a ceiling fan while 
his interrogators demanded do you belong to the resistance are 
you loyal to kuwaiti leader sheikh jaber do you oppose saddam 
his claims could not be independently verified 
he said he was held in the basement of a house in the iraqi port 
of basra with more than 80 others he said they were permitted 
little or nothing for clothing were awakened each morning at 5 
when they were hosed down with water and had only bread and water 
to eat and drink 
he said other methods of torture in the prison included pulling 
out the fingernails of prisoners chopping off pieces of their 
fingers and hands yanking out the hairs of their mustaches and 
beards with pliers and burning them with hot irons 
the man said his captors promised him the best life if he 
would join saddams baath party

and i dont know how long as ive tried to be very frank with 
you all i dont know how long is long enough but ive just got to 
keep putting the focus there and keeping everybody on notice that 
we are going to be successful but its you know id leave it 
right there yeah 
q mr president sir my question goes back to the issue of 
whether to keep the embassy open sir you do seem to have changed 
your position in august in kennebunkport you ordered the state 
department and the administration to order all nonessential 
personnel home the marine guards were ordered home there are very 
few people there today why is it so important to keep the embassy 
open and if an it sounds as if perhaps an armed conflict might 
be triggered whether the embassy gets a resupply of food 
a i believe that the embassy should remain open because i dont 
believe a dictator should violate international law by starving out 
or isolating another persons embassy i think theres a 
fundamental principle involved in that and i view the embassy as 
entitled to certain international respect and international 
protection and so i just want to be sure everybody knows that i 
feel this way what was the second part 
q do you triggering an armed conflict whether or not 
whether the embassy gets a resupply of food 
a well i dont im not going to its too hypothetical i 
mean youre assuming that it would trigger an armed conflict and 
im not going to discuss what will or wont trigger an armed 
conflict but let me simply repeat this one is one that i believe 
is of enormous concern to our allies and to the american people 
and i can certainly recertify as i did yesterday that it is of 
that kind of concern to me 
but i dont want to go into what incident what provocation 
would stimulate military action but im very concerned about this 
the last one he said tom you had your hand up 
q mr president some of your closest friends some senior 
members of your government and even a lot of republican members of 
congress who support you are telling us that your white house staff 
is simply not strong enough not heavy enough to serve you well 
and that further thats one of the reasons why youve taken 
political heat lately are any of these people telling you that 
and if they are 
a no 
q how do you react to that 
a no theyre not telling me that because they know that i 
have full confidence in my white house staff and full confidence in 
my cabinet and i have been blessed with good advice some of which 
i take and maybe more of which i should have taken in one thing or 
another but i have not nobody has come and presented that to me 
at all 
ive read meaningless speculation about that in certain 
periodicals but im inclined to discount it because i know what i 
feel about my top staff and i know whether they have whether they 
have my confidence or not and they do 
do you have a followup to that one laughter 
q over the next couple of months do you envision any shakeup 
at all in the white house staff either in terms of personnel or in 
terms of the structure of the operation 
a there may be some i think well have an announcement very 
soon on one of our top people none that has been not one thats 
been speculated about incidentally but there could be itll be 
two years into an administration and i think if you look back at 
history why theres been very very little turnover so there 
could be one or two 
but it wont be because of the kind of dissatisfaction with 
somebodys performance at all and it damned sure wont be related 
to any standing in the polls or anything as am i ever glad that i 
told you all laughing and i would like to remind you of it 
months ago sept 3 laughter no but seriously i think its 
fair to point out i told you when things were soaring like 
eagles dont believe the polls 
and i think now im entitled to say hey theyre going to come 
on back dont worry about them theyll be all right 
thank you ever so much thank you thanks a lot

tripped up gop gubernatorial candidate clayton williams earlier 
this week 
bush during a campaign trail news conference thursday was 
asked about the proposed constitutional amendment and acknowledged 
he was not familiar with the details of that 
i am strongly in favor of clayton williams bush said 
hastening to add and dont ask me for a review of the ballot 
items yet i will be voting down there tuesday and take a look at 
them 
williams earlier this week stumbled when reporters asked his 
position on the proposed amendment which deals with appointments 
by the states chief executive 
williams said he was unfamiliar with the amendment the only one 
on the ballot and was unclear how he had voted on it when he cast 
his absentee ballot 
im not troubled by that bush said because what i see in 
clayton williams is a person that will be a very good strong 
governor for the state and i am enthusiastically for him and im 
not even familiar with the details of the amendment 
polls show the race between williams and democrat ann richards

iraq said four american hostages it 
described as elderly and sick would soon be freed it said the move 
was in response to a plea from a private group 
information minister latif jassim at a baghdad news conference 
did not say exactly when the four would be released but said it 
would be soon 
he did not disclose the names of those to be freed but later 
the official iraqi news agency identified them as randall trinah 
dr abdul kanji raymond galles and michael barnes 
the report did not give their ages or hometowns 
it said they were being released in response to a petition from 
a group called the arabamerican reconciliation society and that a 
delegation from the group would accompany them back to the united 
states 
a us embassy spokesman welcomed the news and said it was 
seeking details from iraqs foreign ministry 
it is good news our top priority is to get americans out 
said an embassy spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
other americans have been released in groups at the intervention 
of another arabamerican group the rev jesse jackson brought out 
another group 
the iraqi official accused president bush of using the hostage 
issue as a pretext for a military strike which he said could come 
any time 
jassim added that reporters will be allowed to go to strategic 
installations to visit hostages who are being held as human shields 
against attack 
all the americans at sites have complete freedom they can 
watch tv read books and read newspapers the iraqi official 
said they also enjoy the friendship of iraqi forces 
two smuggled letters from captive americans made very different 
claims about life in iraqi captivity one said he had lost 35 
pounds and that he had received no mail or messages in two months 
of captivity 
the other described the toll of isolation as captivity stretched 
on 
you can survive but individually interned one must be 
psychologically capable of living alone within himself he wrote 
adding a plea do not forget the guest hostages 
the letterwriters were not identified and the official 
releasing the letters demanded anonymity he said nonamerican 
foreigners being freed had carried the handwritten letters 
addressed to the embassy 
iraq refers to the estimated 600 foreigners interned at 
strategic military and industrial sites in iraq and occupied kuwait 
as guests 
the complaints coincided with a report that the iraqi foreign 
ministry has instructed missions abroad to issue visas for 
foreigners wishing to spend the christmas and new year holidays 
with their relatives 
the british foreign office dismissed the offer as a cynical 
propaganda move on the part of the iraqis and advised the 
relatives not to go 
several relatives told the british broadcasting corp television 
that they intended to go 
and the iraqi news agency said former prime minister edward 
heath who had helped secure the release of more than 50 britons in 
october called on the families of british guests in iraq to 
accept the offer ina said its correspondent in london reported 10 
wives would do so 
saddam banned foreigners from leaving the country and interned 
some of them after the usled multinational military buildup 
began in the persian gulf the deployment was triggered by saddams 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
since then some groups of foreigners have been allowed to 
leave more than 250 french nationals were released this week after 
iraq decided france was making a goodfaith effort to resolve the 
crisis 
on thursday the official iraqi news agency said the national 
assembly would begin deliberations this weekend on whether to allow 
an estimated 690 bulgarians in iraq and kuwait to leave 
saddam asked lawmakers to consider freeing the bulgarians after 
a visit to baghdad by a bulgarian delegation headed by vice 
president atanas semerdzhiev

the united states should give up its barriers 
to foreign ownership of broadcast outlets and european governments 
should give up their broadcast monopolies the founder of usa today 
said thursday 
we should be less afraid of being fleeced by foreign investors 
and more receptive to being fed by them said allen h neuharth 
chairman of the gannett foundation in a speech at the center for 
strategic and international studies 
crossborder ownership will bring better information products 
to readers and viewers just as the expansion of major us 
newspaper companies to ownership of publications far from their 
home markets has improved newspapers in this country said 
neuharth 
i am delighted at the foresight of robert maxwell rupert 
murdoch and others in making media investments in eastern europe as 
soon as the walls came tumbling down he told an audience of news 
executives 
maxwell is a british publisher murdoch is an australian by 
birth with worldwide media interests who became an american citizen 
to satisfy the ownership rules for television stations 
neuharth urged the newly free journalists of eastern europe not 
to yield to the temptations of journalistic arrogance but to 
search for the truth with fair and balanced reporting 
when he was chairman and chief executive of gannett corp 
publisher of daily newspapers in several cities neuharth oversaw 
the development of usa today the national daily newspaper

prime minister brian mulroney said thursday that 
canada risks splitting along frenchenglish and regional lines and 
he announced creation of a 12member forum to seek a consensus on 
the countrys future 
the announcement made in a speech to the house of commons came 
four months after the failure of the meech lake accord which was 
aimed at winning the signature of frenchspeaking quebec on the 
1982 constitution 
mulroney also spoke five days before a quebec commission is to 
begin its own work reconsidering the ties that bind quebec to 
canada 
the situation is urgent the problem is serious mulroney 
said 
he said the new federal forum is made up of canadians from all 
walks of life though none is a politician its mandate will be to 
seek consensus on what people want from canada and what they want 
canada to be 
the idea is to have people who are not tainted by 
partisanship said harvie andre house leader of the governing 
conservatives 
the new forum is to report back to the government by july 1 
canadas national holiday 
the meech lake accord failed in june when the legislatures of 
manitoba and newfoundland decided against ratifying it 
their refusal to sign angered many of the 67 million quebecers 
and touched off huge protests across quebec some demonstrators 
demanded that quebec separate from canada 
recent polls show that 60 percent of quebecers favor a new 
status for quebec with options ranging from greater autonomy to 
full independence 
frenchspeaking quebecers known as quebecois are a minority 
among canadas 26 million people they have long felt treated as 
secondclass citizens by englishspeaking canada the french fear 
that without special measures and privileges their culture will be 
overwhelmed by english canada 
the meech lake agreement would have designated quebec as a 
distinct society and given it and the other provinces more 
power in such areas as supreme court appointments and senate 
reform the distinct society clause did little more than 
acknowledge the obvious but it was of tremendous symbolic 
importance to the french speakers 
its time we all did some soul searching mulroney said 
acknowledging that finding a consensus will not be easy 
in a country where all citizens are legally equal how can the 
special needs of the frenchspeaking minority as well as natives 
and residents of the poor atlantic provinces be accmmodated the 
prime minister asked 
it seems clear there will be some change in the relationship 
between quebec and the rest of canada after the failure of meech 
lake the only question seems to be how far down the road to 
sovereignty the quebecois want to go 
quebec premier robert bourassa clearly does not want separation 
justice minister gil remillard said recently that both the 
status quo and total independence are out of the question 
in any case its unlikely that most quebecois will be too 
excited about mulroneys commission 
they are not hanging on the results of this exercise said 
richard french a former quebec minister they are hanging on the 
findings of the quebec commission he said 
that 36member group known as the commission on the political 
and constitutional future of quebec is to issue its report in 
march 
richard spicer the former head of the canadian radio 
television and telecommunications commission is heading the 
government forum 
the assignment is awesome he said the procedures are 
illdefined and completely untested the outcome is entirely 
dubious and there is a very high potential for fiasco 
but he added we all think that canada deserves another 
chance 
we are cordially inviting the politicians to keep their noses 
out of this they are not welcome he said

us district judge robert aguilar was 
sentenced to six months in prison thursday for leaking a wiretap to 
a former mobster and lying to the fbi 
aguilar was convicted of the two felonies in august he plans to 
appeal the convictions but faces likely impeachment by congress 
us district judge louis bechtle of philadephia assigned to 
the case by chief justice william rehnquist said aguilars crimes 
would normally warrant a sentence of 21 to 27 months in prison 
including time added for abuse of trust 
bechtle said he imposed a shorter sentence than called for in 
federal guidelines because of the ordeal aguilar will experience in 
impeachment and disbarment proceedings 
these proceedings will be long and humiliating and 
embarrassing and burdensome a major and substantial punishment 
bechtle said 
he also said the jurys verdict of obstruction of justice by a 
judge no less is a chilling message indeed 
the maximum possible sentence was 10 years in prison and 
500000 in fines 
aguilars sentence includes fines and assessments of 2100 and 
1000 hours of community service during two years of supervised 
release after imprisonment

in two trials aguilar was acquitted of approaching two fellow 
judges to seek favorable treatment for former teamsters leader rudy 
tham who was trying have his embezzlement conviction overturned 
and businessman ronald cloud then facing trial for bank fraud 
aguilar said he made only innocuous inquiries in each case 
he was convicted during his second trial of two coverup charges 
disclosing a wiretap in february 1988 to abe chapman an elderly 
exmobster who was thams gobetween and lying in april 1988 to 
fbi agents who questioned him about the wiretap and his involvement 
in thams case 
prosecutors sought a threeyear sentence for aguilar citing the 
seriousness of any crimes by a federal judge and saying aguilar 
repeatedly lied as a witness in his own defense 
aguilars lawyer paul meltzer sought probation and community 
service saying he had an exemplary record had been 
destroyed by the case and faced possible danger in prison 
aguilar did not make a statement during the onehour sentencing 
hearing afterward he approached meltzer in the hallway with a big 
smile and thanked him jess aguilar one of the judges brothers 
said it was a lighter sentence than we anticipated

at least 21744 soviet jews arrived in israel 
in october setting a record in the current soviet immigration 
wave officials reported thursday 
according to the absorption ministry 134000 immigrants have 
arrived so far in 1990 among them 122000 from the soviet union 
the rest were from argentina europe and north america ministry 
spokeswoman ida benshitrit said 
she said 20000 jews came from the soviet union in october gad 
benari spokesman for the quasigovernmental jewish agency that 
helps handle immigration said 21744 came 
israeli officials expect 200000 soviet jews to arrive by the 
end of the year and say more than 1 million soviets might come 
before 1993 
octobers was the highest monthly immigration figure since the 
massive influx of 194851 the nations first years of statehood 
the previous recent high was in september when 19500 nearly all 
of them soviets arrived 
the immigration is aggravating unemployment housing problems 
and straining the governments budget a family of three receives 
about 9000 in government subsidies during its first year in the 
country the daily jerusalem post said 
israel has budgeted 23 billion over the next three years for 
immigrant absorption and is seeking financial aid from outside 
sources 
the jewish agency has gotten 740 million in help from abroad 
and its board of governors appealed to world jewish groups 
thursday asking them to mobilize 13 billion in addition to the 
600 million they have pledged to gather by the end of 1991 
the numbers coming in are causing a strain on thursday the 
jewish agency decided to limit to one ton as opposed to the 
previous two tons the luggage that an average soviet family of 
three is allowed to bring to israel transfer of the luggage

federal safety officials on thursday blamed 
the united airlines inspection system for failing to detect a 
flawed engine part that caused an crash in iowa last year that 
killed 112 people 
the national transportation safety board issuing its opinion 
without dissent said at a hearing that a yearlong investigation 
had concluded that united did not properly consider human 
limitations in its quality control procedures 
the board said that as a result inspectors missed a fatigue 
crack in a critical area of a titanium fan disk in the tail engine 
of the dc10 aircraft 
the plane united flight 232 en route from denver to chicago 
crashed when trying to make an emergency landing in sioux city 
iowa killing 112 of 296 aboard 
the safety board said the disk made by general electric 
aircraft engines disintegrated with force so great that the 
protective housing of the aircrafts hydraulic system used to 
control its flight was shredded 
united officials who attended the daylong hearing rejected the 
boards conclusion saying there is no evidence a halfinch crack 
in the bore area of the fan disk could have been detected when the 
part was last inspected in april 1988 
bob doll uniteds vice president for engineering and quality 
assurance put the airlines position more succinctly 
ge gave us a bum part he said 
he said united had fully cooperated with the safety boards 
inspection and said the boards staff did not understand the zeal 
with which the airlines inspectors look for defects 
the flight was en route to chicago when pieces of metal from the 
fan disk pierced the tail section of the aircraft leading to a 
series of events in which all three hydraulic systems aboard were 
disabled 
the threeman flight crew joined by another united pilot who 
was a passenger on the flight flew the aircraft to the airport at 
sioux city iowa using the thrust of the remaining two engines to 
partially control the aircraft 
but the plane crashed on touchdown 
during the hearing safety board staff members testified that in 
repeated simulations of the situation faced by flight 232s pilots 
the conclusion was reached that the plane could not have been 
landed safely 
john k lauber a safety board member hailed the pilots 
saying the team performance was in fact exquisite in this case 
and in fact resulted in the saving of lives 
the titanium alloy fan disk in the tail engine of the united 
plane was manufactured by general electric in 1971 it weighed 370 
pounds and was about 32 inches in diameter 
the safety board concluded that a flaw in the disk which later 
resulted in a halfinch long crack in a vital area of the engine 
part was formed during manufacture of the titanium ingot from 
which the disk was forged 
it said that crack could have been detected in the disks most 
recent inspection by united 
james wildey a metallurgist who assisted in the investigation 
called the flaw a buried defect and added that defect has 
been in there since day one 
there is no way to introduce this kind of defect through 
operations or anything else he said 
merritt birky a chemical research investigator for the board 
said that using normal inspection procedures there was no reason 
why united shouldnt have found the crack 
he noted that chemicals used to detect flaws in airlines 
inspections of engine parts were found on the failed disk and said 
they should have warned of a defect 
the chemicals are expected to penetrate any cracks on the 
surface the surface is wiped clean then a blotterlike substance 
applied that should draw the chemical back out of the crack the 
blotter will fluoresce under ultraviolet light if any of the 
chemical has been absorbed from the interior of the metal 
the disk in question had been inspected six times the last time 
17 months before the crash without any flaws being found 
the board concluded that hundreds of inspections of such disks 
over the course of 17 years without ever discovering a flaw led to 
laxity on the part of the airlines engine inspectors 
the board said that available inspection methods at the time of 
the manufacture of the disk by ge did not detect the existence of 
the defect 
but it did not otherwise blame ge other than to complain that 
ge production records relevant to the failed disk were incomplete 
and did not insure adequate traceability of the engines component 
parts 
the safety investigators performed exhaustive tests on the 
failed disk after its two broken parts were found in corn fields 
some 80 miles from sioux city 
in other conclusions the safety board said that the emergency 
response at the sioux city airport was initially effective 
but it said the presence of a corn field near the crash site and 
the failure of a water supply truck adversely affected fire 
fighting operations 
noting that a number of small children were killed or injured in 
the crash the board also said that the federal aviation 
administration has not adequately addressed the issue of infant 
protection on passenger aircraft including the possibility of 
requiring child safety seats the faa is considering such a 
requirement 
the board also issued a series of recommendations including 
these to 
identify emerging technologies that can simplify or automate 
the inspection process with the aim of developing a second set of 
eyes to intensify inspection of critical engine rotating 
components 
encourage research and development of backup flight control 
systems for new widebody aircraft using an alternative source of 
power for control systems 
conduct safety reviews of currently operating aircraft to give 
all possible consideration to developing alternative power sources 
for flight and engine controls and to protect them from unforeseen 
accidents

the environmental protection agency gave 
clearance thursday for the limited disposal of radioactive wastes 
from nuclear weapons plants at an energy department site in new 
mexico 
the epa action clears the way for the energy department to begin 
a critical fiveyear test at the waste isolation pilot plant near 
carlsbad nm the plant eventually is hoped to be the nations 
first permanent repository for low and mediumlevel atomic wastes 
energy secretary james watkins has said he planned to begin 
shipping drums of radioactive wastes from government weapons plants 
to the new mexico plant next january 
the wastes in question are not only radioactive but are also 
chemically hazardous 
the epa which must approve the disposal of hazardous wastes 
whether radioactive or not said the permit for the test program 
was being given under the conditions that the waste be limited to 
8500 drums and that they be retrievable 
once the test is concluded the energy department will have to 
obtain new approval from the epa to store wastes at the 700 
million underground depot 
the epa said it considers the new mexico site a mined salt bed 
2150 feet underground that will be sealed will cement and 
compacted salt to be geologically stable and impermeable the 
agency said it is confident that planned handling procedures will 
prevent migration of wastes from the site 
some concern had been raised earlier this year that a 
combination of gases could be formed that might cause an explosion 
although the epa said such an accumulation of gases is unlikely 
the agency has required close monitoring of potential gas buildup 
during the test period 
the energy department has been under considerable pressure to 
proceed with the development of the repository because officials in 
several western states have balked at temporarily storing any more 
radioactive wastes from the weapons plants 
the wastes destined for the new mexico site include a variety of 
materials left over from the production of atomic weapons including 
radioactive sludge as well as contaminated tools equipment and 
clothing

bush administration officials decided thursday 
to stave off a shutdown of the savings and loan bailout by taking 
advantage of a drafting error in last years law 
the mistake will allow the resolution trust corp to borrow up 
to 188 billion more than congress apparently intended 
the shortterm borrowing to be repaid through the sale of 
loans real estate and other assets once owned by failed sampls 
frees the agency to continue some cleanup activities into early 
next year 
the agency can now pay acquirers to take over 18 large insolvent 
thrifts whose rescue had been indefinitely postponed 
david c cooke executive director of the agency complained in 
a memo that congressional inaction still would cause a twomonth 
delay of those 18 deals originally scheduled for completion before 
dec 31 
also the agency will have to postpone the rescues it had 
plannedfor the januarymarch period until the following quarter 
he said 
the delays in shutting down moneylosing thrifts will cost 
taxpayers 250 million to 300 million he said if the 
administration had decided against taking advantage of the error in 
last years law further delays would have cost taxpayers an 
additional 350 million to 400 million cooke said 
the trust corporations oversight board which is chaired by 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady reached its decision in a 
private telephone conference call after the house early sunday 
morning refused to grant the administrations request for more 
money 
brady had said the trust corporation needed 40 billion more to 
cover sampl losses on top of the 50 billion authorized by last 
years law it also needed additional authority to borrow 
shortterm until sampl assets are sold he said 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee told brady in a letter wednesday that he did not believe 
congress which is adjourned until january would object if the 
administration used the drafting error to temporarily borrow 188 
billion 
however the congressional inaction on bradys request for 40 
billion more to cover thrift losses has still left the 
administration facing a complete halt in the bailout early next 
year

soviet newspapers are becoming more competitive 
and enterprising two journalists from the country told american 
colleagues thursday 
its very exciting to be a journalist in these times oleg 
shibko a moscowbased editor for the novosti press agency said at 
the associated press managing editors convention 
shibko and vitaly gan washington correspondent for the 
communist daily pravda described a new law that gives soviet 
journalists more freedom with this new law we are in the same 
position as the western media are today shibko said 
the law grants freedom of the press but prohibits publication 
of state secrets pornography or material with a tone of racial or 
ethnic superiority 
the new freedom has given rise to several new dailies that have 
eroded the circulation of the soviet unions older giant 
newspapers 
pravdas circulation for instance has fallen from 11 million 
to 7 million gan said he predicted circulation would fall another 
2 million or 3 million next year and needs a radical facelift 
pravda is still on the conservative side gan said it 
still lacks flexibility 
shibko said soviet newspapers eventually will face the same 
market pressures faced in the united states im sure only those 
that meet the demands of the reader will prosper shibko said 
both journalists predicted the soviet press eventually will 
accept westernstyle advertising and create oped pages reflecting 
a greater diversity of views 
the communist partys long use of the press for propaganda has 
weakened soviet journalists credibility gan said 
gan said a story he wrote about washingtons homeless was 
greeted with disbelief our readers dont believe he said 
people say were sick and tired of hearing your lousy 
propaganda 
pressed for an analysis of the soviet economy and politics the 
journalists predicted some of the 15 republics would leave the 
union in th next few years 
president mikhail gorbachevs international popularity will not 
help him at home gan said soviets were unimpressed that gorbachev 
won the nobel peace prize he said 
if you have to stand in line to get cigarettes do you care if 
your leader gets a nobel gan said if you have to stand in 
line for bread or meat do you care

democrat harvey gantt on thursday 
accused jesse helms his republican opponent for the us senate 
of trying to scare voters about 100 miles away helms was on the 
stump claiming gantt was no good 
sen helms has decided that the best way is to insult your 
intelligence to scare you to be divisive to drive wedges between 
people gantt told a rally of about 600 people in this port city 
helms told supporters in graham a small industrial town half 
way across the state that gantt was trying to divert voters 
attention 
mr gantt says what were saying is divisive helms told 
about 200 people thats right its dividing him from any 
reasonable standings in the polls 
gantt referred to an advertisement that began airing wednesday 
it showed the hands of a white man holding then crumpling a job 
rejection letter 
you needed that job the announcer says and you were the 
best qualified but they had to give it to a minority because of a 
racial quota is that really fair gantt supports ted kennedys 
racial quota law that makes the color of your skin more important 
than your qualifications 
helms has also run a radio ad accusing gantt of running a secret 
campaign aimed at black voters by running ads on stations with 
largely black audiences another helsm ad says gantt used his 
minority status to get a television station license which he and 
his partners later sold 
campaigning in greensboro helms was asked if his comments and 
ads would insult black voters by way of a reply helms said his 
senate office has assisted more than 700000 people and about 40 
percent of them were black 
helms also mentioned gantts past involvement in the television 
station 
the fcc application says the reason they wanted this tv 
station is so it could serve the minority interests in the 
charlotte area helms said it made him a millionaire but he 
doesnt want to admit that this guy cant tell the truth about 
anything 
gantt said helms was bashing a legitimate business deal and 
denied it made him a millionaire

points 
in the other poll gantt held a 4 percentage point lead the

deputy prime minister sir geoffrey howe resigned 
from the government thursday following a rift with prime minister 
margaret thatcher over britains commitment to europe 
his resignation came five days after howe suggested in a 
television interview that mrs thatcher would eventually drop her 
adamant opposition to a single european currency 
in his letter of resignation howe said i am deeply anxious 
that the mood you have struck in rome last weekend and in the 
house of commons this tuesday will make it more difficult for 
britain to hold and retain a position of influence in this vital 
debate 
i do not believe that i can any longer serve with honor as 
a member of your government 
at the european community summit last weekend mrs thatcher 
found herself alone against 11 other leaders who set a timetable 
for currency union then in a rowdy house session mrs thatcher 
shouted her attitude toward a single currency and closer political 
ties within europe no no no 
cabinet government howe wrote is all about trying to 
persuade one another from within so too within the unique 
partnership of nations that is making the european community plain 
speaking certainly but matched always by mutual respect and 
restraint in pursuit of a common cause 
mrs thatcher responded that she did not believe their 
differences are nearly so great as you suggest and said she 
was saddened by his departure 
mrs thatcher has been bitten by the man she treated as a 
doormat and she deserves it said neil kinnock leader of the 
opposition labor party 
this is a mortal blow to mrs thatchers government said 
paddy ashdown leader of the small proeuropean liberal democratic 
party 
the reason is europe and the split in the conservative party 
is now irreconcilable ashdown said in an interview with channel 
4 television news 
howe was the last cabinet minister to have served continuously 
since mrs thatcher came to power in 1979 but he had appeared to 
be out of favor since he was replaced as foreign secretary last 
summer 
the resignation was announced two days after mrs thatcher 
sidestepped a challenge from kinnock to declare her confidence in 
howe the deputy prime minister is too big a man to need a little 
man like you to stand up for him mrs thatcher told kinnock 
however she said nothing about howes disagreement with her 
about european policy which had long been evident 
tall rotund and softspoken howe seemed an unlikely 
participant in a controversy labor party lawmaker denis healey 
once remarked that arguing with howe was like being savaged by a 
dead sheep 
because of his position on europe howe had been removed as 
foreign minister last year and shunted into the newly created post 
of deputy prime minister he also held the titles of lord president 
of the council and leader of the house of commons 
in a television interview in london howe suggested that mrs 
thatcher might eventually change her mind 
weve had occasions like this before he said ive 
attended a number of summit meetings with the prime minister on

president bush sharply attacked saddam 
hussein from the campaign trail on thursday saying that iraqi 
brutalities in the persian gulf rivaled those under adolf hitler 
and pledging anew to see his aggression turned back 
i dont think the status quo can go on forever bush said 
i dont know how long is long enough to depend on sanctions 
alone to force iraqs withdrawal from kuwait 
toward the end of a long day of angry rhetoric directed at 
saddam bush said im not trying to sound the tocsin of war 
his spokesman said the president was speaking out to prepare the 
american people for any eventuality 
marlin fitzwater said if we do have to take dramatic action 
we want them to know why 
bush spent his day campaigning from massachusetts to florida to 
ohio for republican candidates in next weeks elections and 
blending his political activity with remarks focused on the persian 
gulf crisis 
at his news conference in orlando bush said it was a little 
bit awkward because we are a few days before an election and i want 
to continue to work for republican candidates 
at the same time he said he wanted to keep the american people 
informed about his feelings in the persian gulf where more than 
200000 american forces are deployed 
but there were signs that some democrats were beginning to chafe 
at bushs gulf rhetoric in the final days of the midterm election 
campaign 
if the president wants politics to end at the waters edge he 
has an obligation to leave events beyond the waters edge out of 
campaign politics said rep david obey dwis 
if the president has important information concerning the 
pending crisis in the gulf he should transmit that information 
from the white house not from the campaign trail obey said 
the president told reporters at a lateafternoon news 
conference i want to have a peaeful resolution to the gulf 
crisis he said i am not ruling out further options and i am 
not trying to prepare our country for war 
bush ordered the military buildup in early august when iraq 
invaded oilrich kuwait top american officials have said the 
administration is considering adding another 100000 troops to the 
deployment in saudi arabia 
earlier in mashpee mass bush said saddams tactic of using 
american civilians as human shields against attacks on military 
targets was brutality that i dont believe adolf hitler ever 
participated in 
the remark raised eyebrows and bush was asked at his florida 
news conference whether his comparison might be overdrawn i 
dont think im overstating it the president replied 
bush was asked about his comparison of saddam with the man whose 
regime killed millions of jews and other civilians during world war 
ii and said there was an awful similarity he told reporters 
he believed that hitler did not stake people out against military 
targets and he did indeed respect the legitimacy of the 
embassies 
he said there was a valid comparison to be made between the 
behavior of iraqis invading force in kuwait and the way nazis 
brutalized poland at the beginning of world war ii 
bush also was asked about his wifes comments that he would be 
willing to meet with saddam to resolve the crisis he didnt 
exactly embrace the idea but said his position at any such meeting 
would be no condition no negotiation just leave kuwait 
there is no flexibility on our position there is no 
compromise 
bush scoffed at saddams offer to permit families to visit the 
hostages during thanksgiving and christmas i see it as a ploy 
said bush adding that the hostages should be freed for family 
reunions at home 
i dont think hell win the humanitarian of the year award 
for the offer bush said and he reiterated government advice that 
americans not travel into iraq or occupied kuwait 
bushs words in massachusetts were reminiscent of his comments 
on panama before sending troops there last year he said the united 
states has no argument with the iraqi people none at all we 
bear no hostility to the iraqi people our problem is with 
saddam hussein alone 
while talking tough at campaign stops in massachusetts bush 
also said he still plans to give time for the united 
nationsimposed economic sanctions against iraq to work 
i want desperately to have a peaceful resolution to this 
crisis bush told a political gathering in burlington i hope 
there will never be a shot fired in anger no one wants a 
peaceful end to this crisis more than i do but no one is more 
determined to see his aggression turned back than i am and i will 
not change on that he said 
some of the most combative remarks during the day came from 
fitzwater who said there would soon be a turning point in the 
status of the diplomats cut off from outside supply at the us 
embassy in kuwait city 
at some point theyve either got to leave or be 
reprovisioned he said he declined to say how many days longer 
the group could hold out with their supplies blocked by occupying 
iraqi troops 
bush has made no secret of the fact that he would like to see 
saddam out of power but has not made that a stated objective for 
the us military deployed in the gulf 
however vice president dan quayle on wednesday said in an 
interview on pbs macneillehrer newshour you cannot simply 
allow saddam hussein to have this military power and have the 
technology into the future 
i believe that the world certainly understands that a saddam 
hussein who has ballistic missiles who has chemical capability 
biological capability who would like to have the nuclear 
capability cannot continue to have that capability even if he 
withdraws from kuwait quayle said 
deputy national security adviser bob gates traveling with bush 
on thursday said quayles comments did not indicate a shift in 
us objectives 
bush himself asked about quayles comments said one us 
objective was the security and stability of the gulf something 
that obviously is affected by the iraqi arsenal 
so i dont think that the goalposts are being moved i think 
its just simply a statement of reality the president said 
bush on thursday spent less time blasting democrats on budget 
and other issues and more talking about the gulf crisis 
i want you to put politics aside he told an audience in 
mashpee 
fitzwater said that bush was urged to continue his attack on 
democrats in certain quarters but he surveyed the whole 
matter and decided this was the best approach

united methodist bishops facing a 
twodecade membership decline have launched an effort to 
revitalize the 9millionmember denomination 
a pastoral letter released wednesday by 100 bishops attending 
an international conference and a supporting document called for 
revitalizing united methodist churchs local congregations 
the documents did not spell out a plan for shoring up sagging 
membership 
mainline protestant groups in general have suffered a loss in 
membership over the past 20 years united methodist church 
membership has eroded steadily since a peak of 11 million members 
in 1965 
the whole document we have prepared has a section in which we 
talk about the malaise in the united methodist church said 
retired bishop roy clark of memphis tenn executive director of a 
bishops committee that prepared the letter and related documents 
its not a negative judgment against anybody but means we 
need to be awakened to the fact that we need to be more vital 
because the culture no longer supports the church as it once did 
he said 
the obvious decline in membership of many of our congregations 
troubles us the supporting document states it adds that the 
decline is partially a reflection of a more secular culture 
bishops emphasized that neither the letter nor supporting 
documents are meant to be a grand master plan local 
congregations must follow 
the letter read by bishop leroy hodapp of indianapolis 
president of the council of bishops declares 
we the people of god called united methodists have come to a 
critical turning point in our history the world in which our faith 
seemed secure is passing away we must choose to be faithful to 
jesus christ in our time 
there are many signs within our congregations that we 
recognize this new era the realization is dawning on us that we 
must be more intentional about being the church god calls us to 
be 
about 3200 clergy and lay persons from around the world were to 
take part in the conference which continues through sunday 
the united methodist council of bishops a major denominational 
policymaking body was to meet nov 69 in fort worth

iraq on thursday promised to release four more american hostages 
soon and insisted it is treating foreign captives well president 
bush denounced the hostageholding and unleashed his harshest 
rhetoric yet against saddam hussein 
they have committed outrageous acts of barbarism bush said 
of saddams forces brutality i dont believe that adolf hitler 
ever participated in anything of that nature 
i dont think the status quo can go on forever bush said 
while campaigning for republican candidates in orlando fla but he 
added i dont know how long is long enough to depend on 
unordered sanctions alone to force iraqs withdrawal from 
kuwait 
aboard the uss iwo jima sailors and marines paid tribute to 10 
comrades killed in a boilerroom accident the deaths tuesday were 
the worst navy casualties to date in operation desert shield the 
us military deployment launched after iraq overran kuwait three 
months ago 
despite iraqi assurances about the captives welfare letters 
smuggled from two american hostages and released by a us official 
in baghdad painted a picture of fear 
one of the unidentified americans said he had been moved five 
times and was receiving no mail or messages he said he had lost 35 
pounds 
the other said he considered himself a prisoner in the iraqi 
gulag and pleaded please do not forget the guest hostages 
iraq calls the detained foreigners guests 
bushs comments directed at iraqi president saddam reflected an 
escalation in rhetoric to match the united states growing military 
might in the persian gulf region the united states has said up to 
100000 troops will be dispatched to join the 220000member force 
already deployed 
today i am more determined than ever this aggression will not 
stand the president told an audience earlier thursday in 
burlington mass the brutality against innocent citizens will 
not be tolerated and will not stand 
bushs remark comparing saddams abuses to hitlers raised some 
eyebrows in the audience he was asked at his florida news 
conference whether his comparison might be overdrawn i dont 
think im overstating it he replied 
bush said there is an awful similarity between saddam and 
hitler whose regime killed millions of jews and other civilians 
during wrld war ii 
the president said he believed that hitler did not stake 
people out against military targets and he did indeed respect the 
legitimacy of the embassies 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush was trying 
to prepare the american people for any eventuality and added 
if we do have to take dramatic action we want them to know 
why 
iraq expressed renewed fears that the united states will use 
reports of hostage maltreatment as a pretext to launch a military 
strike iraqi information minister latif jassim announcing plans 
to free four sick and elderly americans denied the captives were 
being treated badly about 1000 americans are believed held in 
iraq and kuwait 
all the americans at sites have complete freedom they can 
watch tv read books and read newspapers he told reporters in 
baghdad they also enjoy the friendship of iraqi forces 
the official iraqi news agency identifed the four to be freed as 
randall trinah dr abdul kanji raymond galles and michael barnes 
it did not give their ages or hometowns or say when they would be 
freed 
it said the pledge to release them was in response to a petition 
from the arabamerican reconciliation society and said a 
delegation from the group would accompany them to the united 
states 
thousands of foreigners were trapped in iraq and kuwait by the 
invasion since then iraq has selectively freed hundreds of them 
the latest mass release was of hundreds of french nationals this 
week 
western governments have denounced what they say is saddams use 
of the hostages to try to split the multinational alliance opposing 
him 
the issue is proving divisive britains foreign office on 
thursday criticized germany over former west german chancellor 
willy brandts plans to visit baghdad to press for foreign 
hostages freedom 
brandt is going as a private citizen but with the german 
governments endorsement 
iraq said it would to allow holiday visits by relatives of 
hostages but bush scoffed at the offer thursday i see it as a 
ploy he said adding the hostages should be freed for family 
reunions 
i dont think hell win the humanitarian of the year award 
for the offer bush said 
the us reaction coincided with a report that the iraqi foreign 
ministry has instructed missions abroad to issue visas for 
foreigners wishing to spend the christmas and new year holidays 
with their relatives 
the british foreign office dismissed the offer as a cynical 
propaganda move and advised the relatives not to go 
as tensions rose bushs wife barbara on a campaign stop in 
omaha neb said the president would do whatever he could to end 
the crisis including meeting with saddam 
i think he would consider anything to get the kuwaitis back in 
their own country and to get our men out she said 
in the memorial ceremony aboard the amphibious assault ship uss 
iwo jima more than 1000 american servicemen stood at attention on 
deck honoring the 10 victims of tuesdays boilerroom accident 
reporters and photographers were not permitted to attend the 
memorial service but the navy released a videotape of the event 
servicemen sang the navy hymn a 21gun salute was fired and 
bugles played taps 
as the iwo jima mourned tuesdays victims thousands of other 
marines went ahead with exercises in which they simulated a landing 
on the beaches of kuwait 
navy officials refused to disclose details about the exercises 
but said they were being held off oman the iwo jima was en route 
to the drills when the accident happened forcing it to turn back 
and anchor at bahrain 
the pentagon said thursday that iraq has removed about 300 
armored vehicles from kuwait while adding more artillery pieces 
bob hall a pentagon spokesman said that defense department 
analysts see little significance in the changes 
he said the number of iraqi troops in an around kuwait was the 
same as a month ago about 430000

ma anand sheela was among seven followers 
of indian guru bhagwan shree rajneesh who conspired to kill us 
attorney charles turner alleged a federal indictment unsealed 
thursday 
sheela was personal secretary to the late guru when he ran the 
oregon commune of rajneeshpuram she had been imprisoned on 
unrelated federal charges until her deportation in 1988 to germany 
the plot was disclosed earlier this year and some arrests were 
made but thurday was the first time sheelas involvement was 
alleged 
the indictment was issued in may but sealed until the defendants 
could be arrested 
all but sheela 41 who is a native of baroda india have been 
arrested overseas and are awaiting extradition said assistant us 
attorney barry sheldahl 
the indictments accuse the defendants of plotting to kill the 
gurus physician swami devaraj and charges all but sheela with 
illegal interstate transportation of guns 
the maximum penalty for murder conspiracy is life in prison 
the other defendants are sally ann croft also known as ma prem 
savita ann phyllis mccarthy also known as ma yoga vidya susan 
lissanevitch also known as ma anand su catherine jane stubbs 
also known as ma shanti bhadra carol matthews also known as ma 
prem samadhi and richard kevin langford also known as swami 
anugiten 
croft and lissanevitch were arrested in england mccarthy in 
south africa and the other three in germany 
sheldahl said the alleged plot was an attempt to stop a us 
immigration and naturalization service investigation that probe 
led to rajneeshs deportation the arrest of sheela and other 
rajneeshee leaders and the disbanding of the commune in 1985 
rajneesh who died in india in january called himself the 
rich mans guru and taught meditation as a means to 
enlightenment 
sheela was deported after serving 29 months in federal prison in 
california for her role in various criminal activities including 
attempted murder arson and contaminating restaurant salad bars 
with salmonella 
sheldahl said sheela is still being sought 
the oregonian cited unnamed federal surces as saying she might 
be in switzerland since she married urs birnstiel a swiss fugitive 
from a federal wiretapping charge here 
the newspaper said sheelas marriage makes her a swiss citizen 
if she is in switzerland authorities cant extradite her because 
the united states and switzerland have no extradition treaty 
the indictment said the plotters picked an assassination team 
from among themselves and used commune money and a false birth 
certificate to buy guns 
the defendants practiced different ways of killing turner and 
watched his movements the indictment said 
turner said that before he learned of the plot he had a sense 
of peril 
i had a premonition on june 20 1985 he said i cant say 
why and then later i had another feeling on aug 1 1985 
he said the second premonition occurred after he saw a 
rajneeshee pointing a video camera at him while he addressed a 
meeting of the oregon bar association 
no harm ever came to him and the only evasive action he took was 
to alter his routes coming home

ignoring their governments advice 10 wives of 
british hostages said thursday they will fly to iraq to seek their 
husbands freedom other relatives welcomed iraqs offer to let 
them visit at christmas 
we know our husbands are suffering and we just want to go back 
and rescue them said dorothy goodwin leader of the group of 
wives who said they will go to baghdad next week 
we are aware of the foreign office advice not to make the 
trip but we are not politicians she said 
the british foreign office on wednesday accused iraq of 
exploitation over its offer announced on iraqi television that it 
would let relatives of british american and other foreign hostages 
held in iraq and occupied kuwait visit them this christmas and new 
year 
in the same statement wednesday the foreign office repeated its 
advice to britons not to go to iraq 
on thursday the foreign office called on germany and italy to 
block a planned visit by former west german chancellor willy 
brandt who hopes to secure the release of more hostages 
it said european leaders agreed at their rome summit last 
weekend not to send representatives to negotiate with iraq for the 
release of hostages 
it follows that a visit by herr brandt or any other european 
politicians must be discouraged in accordance with the conclusions 
of the rome european council the foreign office said 
britain which has the greatest number of hostages was not 
consulted about this germanitalian initiative it said 
iraq holds about 1800 britons there and in kuwait following 
president saddam husseins aug 2 invasion of the emirate 
prime minister margaret thatchers conservative government 
which has sent 9000 troops to the gulf to assist the international 
force facing iraq has refused to let the hostage issue weaken its 
hostility she wants saddam tried as a war criminal 
the 10 women said they will ignore the foreign office advice and 
use the visas given them by the iraqi embassy in london 
i am petrified of going back said mrs goodwin 55 of 
amersham in southern england who was allowed to return home 
recently but had to leave her husband peter 58 behind he worked 
as a captain with kuwait airlines 
she said the iraqi embassy told the women that traveling in a 
large group could boost their chances of meeting saddam 
the british foreign office on wednesday dismissed iraqs offer 
to allow visits by relatives to the hostages at the holidays as 
cynical but some relatives said thursday they will go 
if my son is still in iraq at christmas i shall take every 
opportunity of going to see him said donald fathers of oxford 
we are considering it said elizabeth godsall of london the 
mother of another hostage the british government is not doing 
anything for us i say negotiate and fetch the men home 
fathers accused the british and us governments of seeking war 
with iraq he and mrs godsall were speaking in television 
interviews with the british broadcasting corp 
in a message thursday to former conservative prime minister 
edward heath saddam agreed to release briton rory duncan 19 and 
his father bruce 
rorys brother alexander 21 and an iraqi security man were 
killed in an auto accident in kuwait rory was injured in it too

the running mate of the republican 
gubernatorial candidate who dropped out of the race will not appear 
on next weeks ballot the minnesota supreme court ruled thursday 
sharon clark nominated in the gop primary with jon grunseth 
had asked the court to reverse a decision taking her off the ballot 
and replacing her with the running mate of grunseths replacement 
grunseths replacement arne carlson chose joanell dyrstad as 
his running mate 
they ruled secretary of state joan growe was right that the 
decision to place on the ballot the team of carlson and dyrstad was 
proper said chief deputy attorney general jack tunheim 
grunseth submitted an affidavit of withdrawal after dropping out 
of the race sunday amid allegations he tried to swim nude with 
teenage girls at a 1981 party and cheated on both his wives 
clark did not withdraw arguing that she had the right to remain 
on the ballot because she won the support of the republican party 
and gop voters in the primary 
were absolutely delighted carlson said we feel like 
weve been through the trials of job and that has finally come to 
an end 
dyrstad said she and carlson had always felt like a team now 
we officially are one she said its a relief 
clark in a statement read at grunseths former campaign 
headquarters thanked the supreme court for considering the case 
this has been an extraordinary political year full of 
firsts she said 
to dyrstad clark said i hope you will understand that you 
and i have been caught in a situation not of our making i had to 
do what i felt was right and what i owed the primary voters 
clark pledged her support to carlson 
the ruling delighted growe who had decided to take clark off 
the ballot for tuesdays election she said she will authorize the 
printing friday of supplemental ballots to reflect the supreme 
court ruling 
because they acted promptly minnesota voters will know what 
names will be on the ballot growe said its good to know the 
supreme court agrees with the decisions you make 
the supreme court agreed with tunheim who argued that dyrstad 
should be carlsons running mate because a state constitutional 
amendment requires candidates for governor and lieutenant governor 
in minnesota to run as a team

it was no accident that officials of the roman 
catholic church picked thursday all saints day to unearth the 
bones of a former slave who is the first black american proposed 
for sainthood 
cardinal john oconnor turned the first shovelful of dirt at the 
small cemetery at old st patricks church in little italy thats 
where pierre toussaint was buried in 1853 when he died at age 87 
born into slavery in haiti toussaint is now considered the 
founder of catholic charities because he helped the needy for 66 
years before formal services for aid existed 
it would be magnificent if it could eventually be determined 
that he deserves to be a saint oconnor told about 100 
spectators pressed against police barricades 
toussaint was born in 1766 and brought to new york at age 21 by 
his french owners still enslaved he became a leading hairdresser 
in the city and was allowed to keep some of his income 
when toussaints owner died he left an impoverished widow and 
child in a typical act of generosity toussaint secretly supported 
them for 20 years the widow freed toussaint from slavery just 
before she died in 1807 
once free he bought the freedom of slaves and lavished money on 
charities including an orphanage and the citys first school for 
black children he also entered quarantined sections of the city to 
help yellow fever victims oconnor described toussaint as an 
extremely holy man a great humble man who made a considerable 
amount of money he used that money for the poor he visited the 
poor wherever they were he gave away all his money 
church officials say the case for sainthood is boosted by one 
reported miracle the recovery of a young haitian with cancer who 
refused medical care and relied solely on prayers to toussaint 
in 1989 the church began investigating and examining toussaints 
life the first formal step if he is to be canonized the process 
can take years 
identifying toussaints remains is part of that process if he 
is made a saint his bones may be distributed to churches and other 
holy places 
though sainthood may be far away as workmen dug deep into the 
graveyard people darted past the barricades to pocket fistfuls of 
earth as keepsakes 
only a few bones were unearthed in the first day of digging a 
church spokesman said the project could go on for days 
workmen had found a portion of a jaw with teeth said dr victor 
tchertkoff head of the department of pathology at new york medical 
college in valhalla other small bones appeared to be from human 
ribs 
the remains will go to an anthropological pathologist he said 
church officials said it was likely that the remains of 
toussaint his wife and stepdaughter were buried in wood coffins 
that have since disintegrated 
on a piece of concrete lifted off the grave before digging 
began toussaint was described as a catholic black man respected 
and revered for the integrity of his life and for his many works of 
charity 
as oconnor stood outside the cemetery on thursday he said i 
wish i were as holy as he

the doctor of a woman who has been in a 
coma for seven years testified thursday her condition is a living 
hell and the feeding tube keeping her alive should be removed 
dr james davis who is treating nancy cruzan said he changed 
his mind about her death because there is no hope for recovery 
the us supreme court rejected a request by ms cruzans 
parents to end her life but the couples lawyer went back to 
court saying he had new evidence showing she would want to die 
i think it would be personally a living hell davis said

noticeable unease over the selective distribution of gas masks 
among the favored in iraq 
the kdp based in london faxed its statement to the associated

intelligence forces have moved against two powerful arab tribes

deserters 
about 150 shamer and jebour tribesmen were arrested for refusing 
to join the army during a search operation that began oct 25 the

a military judge thursday canceled the 
courtmartial of mississippis top national guard officer saying 
gov ray mabus wrongly influenced the case 
the judge rejected allegations from the governors office that 
adj gen arthur j farmer used insider information to purchase 
land near camp shelby which is targeted for expansion 
mabus reprimanded farmer for participating in the august 1989 
purchase of five acres and later suspended him 
judge william eshee jr said mabus used undue influence in 
convening the courtmartial eshee cited evidence that the 
governors advisers may have helped him select members of a 
military court 
the states code of military justice says the governor must 
personally select members of such a court 
eshee also cited mabus placement of gen bela chain on a list 
of prospective jurors in october 1989 farmer attempted to remove 
chain as commander of a national guard unit in tupelo farmer 
testified tuesday during a pretrial courtmartial hearing that 
mabus stepped in to prevent chains dismissal 
it would have been the first military trial against a 
mississippi national guard officer the decision could be appealed 
to the mississippi court of military appeals a body that has never 
been used 
farmer said he intends to resume his duties 
i just want to do the duties of adjutant general and i will be 
in contact with the commander in chief mabus to work out those 
details he said 
eshees ruling includes a prohibition against the federal 
government reconvening a courtmartial against farmer on the same 
charges 
i am disappointed in the ruling particularly given the fact 
that gen farmer by his own admission showed bad judgment in the 
purchase of land adjacent to camp shelby mabus said in a 
statement 
mabus said a military investigator recommended a courtmartial 
mabus cannot fire farmer his dismissal would require an 
impeachment trial by the senate or an ethics conviction 
basically what this ruling by the judge says is that an 
adjutant general can attempt to use his position for profit and the 
military cant or wont do anything mabus said 
farmer 57 of crystal springs and his attorneys were required 
during the nearly fourday preliminary hearing to submit evidence 
showing that mabus actions were vindictive prosecution 
a reasonable person would conclude that unlawful command 
influence has affected this case eshee said 
he first announced his decision wednesday and made it final 
thursday 
mabus appointed farmer adjutant general in 1988 which placed 
him in command of the states 16000 guardsmen 
mabus assumed daytoday control of the guard after suspending 
farmer in february the governor ordered farmers courtmartial 
oct 22 farmer continued to draw his 50400 annual salary

lawyers picked a jury thursday and began 
testimony in a case of potty parity 
denise wells a 33yearold legal secretary is being tried for 
using the mens restroom at a concert her trip to the toilet made 
national news and led to talkshow appearances with johnny carson 
geraldo rivera and joan rivers 
but on thursday she was barred by her lawyer and sister valorie 
wells davenport from talking to reporters 
at one point before the proceedings began she went to the 
womens restroom and emerged smiling while nearly a dozen 
photographers clicked away 
she was ticketed for allegedly violating a city ordinance that 
bars members of one sex from using a public restroom designed for 
members of the opposite sex in a manner calculated to cause a 
disturbance 
she faces up to a 200 fine if convicted of the misdemeanor 
some states including new york and virginia have approved 
socalled potty parity regulations that give women as many or more 
toilets than men to compensate for the extra time that women can 
take 
in 1988 two virginia tech researchers with stopwatches and 
questionnaires found that a womans visit to a public restroom runs 
50 percent longer than a mans 
ms davenport said her clients defense in the trial that was 
expected to last at least two days would be based on a clause in 
the law saying the person intended to cause a disturbance 
she was just trying to go to the bathroom not cause a 
disturbance ms davenport said 
ms wells used the mens restroom at the summit during the july 
7 concert by country music star george strait because the line 
outside the womens restroom was too long 
ms davenport said her sister waited until intermission ended 
and again tried to use the womens room but the line was even 
longer then in desperation she followed a couple into the mens 
room while the other womans date cleared the way 
police officer daniel ramsey was working as a security guard at 
the summit when he found ms wells using a mens restroom 
ramsey testified that he saw her coming out of a stall 
she said in a voice that could be heard to the front of the 
restroom there i left the lid up just like yall like it 
he said 
ramsey said he escorted ms wells out of the bathroom and cited 
her 
potential jurors were asked if theyd ever been in a public 
restroom intended for the opposite sex 
ten of 30 potential jurors raised their hands each explained 
their reasons including the same reason offered by ms wells that 
there were too many women waiting for their restroom while the 
mens room had toilets available 
ms wells was surrounded by family and friends who snickered at 
some of the panels responses 
lets face it were everywhere weve got a woman lawyer a 
woman defendant a woman judge we may even have a woman 
governor ms davenport told the panel the last reference was to 
the democratic gubernatorial candidacy of ann richards 
during questioning before municipal court judge francelia totty 
several male jurors said they had been offended by young women who 
entered mens rooms giggling and used the toilets while men were 
present but they said by the desperation in their manner it 
was clear the women felt it was an emergency situation 
even though its a minimal case its still a crime and its 
my belief and denises belief that she did not violate that 
ordinance said another lawyer for wells christopher tritico 
tritico said ms wells did not enter the mens room to shock 
anyone 
i dont think the ordinance in and of itself is wrong but the 
way it is drafted it allows people in an emergency to get 
relief tritico said 
she violated a city ordinance said karl rosette the 
prosecutor she entered without the permission of the person in 
charge

csx transportation corp agreed thursday to 
pay 16 million to thousands of people who fled their homes when a 
train bearing toxic phosphorus derailed and ignited on a summer day 
in 1986 
the money partly settles a lawsuit stemming from the miamisburg 
train derailment officials said the ensuing fire and toxic fumes 
forced the evacuation of an estimated 30000 people some for up to 
five days 
no injuries from the fumes or fire were reported the cause of 
the accident has never been determined 
common pleas judge john kessler said csx agreed to put the money 
in a trust fund 
attorney stanley chesley representing evacuees in the 
classaction lawsuit said he doesnt know how many people will be 
eligible for the money their claims range from injuries during the 
evacuation to time lost from work he said 
chesley said 14000 evacuees have already settled with csx he 
did not disclose the size of that settlement 
thursdays settlement came after a nearly fiveweek trial 
stemming from the july 8 1986 accident in which a 
phosphorusfilled railroad car leaked and exploded when the 
chemical hit the air 
chesley filed the lawsuit against csx the union tank car co 
which owned the rail car and albright and wilson inc which 
leased it 
the settlement removes csx from the case union tank car and 
albright and wilson remain as defendants the jury must determine 
who if anyone is responsible for the derailment 
the 44car train was coming from quebec canada heading to 
fernald ohio at 45 mph when it derailed crossing a bridge south 
of miamisburg 
the temperature that day was in the 90s phosphorus ignites on 
contact with air that is 86 degrees or more its fumes can cause 
nausea vomiting and diarrhea and can burn the skin and eyes on 
contact it can also be fatal 
james oconnell a csx attorney said the railroad denies 
responsibility but decided to make the settlement any way 
csx had denied liability throughout these proceedings and 
continues to do so oconnell said however an amicable 
resolution is in most instances the best possible result and 
we felt that the settlement that has now been negotiated was a 
significant one under all of the circumstances

state attorney general steven clark was 
convicted thursday of abusing his expense privileges he was fined 
10000 but drew no prison time 
obviously im very disappointed clark said after the 
verdict was announced as ive said all along it was never my 
intention to defraud or deceive 
judge perry v whitmore fined clark 10000 but did not sentence 
him to jail which clarks lawyer said would be a death sentence 
for arkansas top legal official 
even though you are attorney general in this respect i feel 
ridiculous but i must tell you you can appeal whitmore said 
the corruption trial went to the jury earlier in the day after a 
prosecutor compared the attorney generals ambitions to a runaway 
train fueled by state money 
the general was feeding that train and as he was feeding that 
train to keep his gubernatorial campaign alive hed throw coal 
in that coal is your money prosecutor chris piazza told jurors 
in closing arguments 
clark 43 was convicted of a less severe charge he was charged 
with theft by deception of more than 2500 which carried a 
maximum prison sentence of 20 years and a 15000 fine clark was 
convicted of theft by deception of less than 2500 which carried 
a maximum penalty of three to 10 years in prison and a 15000 
fine 
piazza said after the verdict was announced i dont ever 
regret a jury verdict 
earlier piazza said clark was consumed by his dream to become 
governor but couldnt afford to entertain political supporters and 
generate campaign contributions without the help of state money 
through his expense account and state credit card 
defense attorney bill bristow said clark already had lost 
another jury has already issued a verdict to steve clark that 
is the jury of public opinion bristow said 
steve clark has been the subject of ridicule lets go to 
lunch is a statewide joke bristow said steve clarks 
political dream the dream to be governor is gone 
if steve clark ran for dog catcher right now hed lose to a 
writein candidate 
clark attorney general since 1979 earns 26500 a year plus a 
15000 salary supplement 
published reports of discrepancies in his expense reports 
prompted clark to drop out of the democratic gubernatorial primary 
feb 7 
piazza said clark lived off the state 
he said clark stayed at the peabody hotel in memphis tenn 
with a girlfriend he stayed there on your money you paid for 
him and her to have room service piazza said 
bristow said clark might be liable for civil penalties if he 
used poor judgment but insisted that clark didnt break any laws 
what youre going to see is unauthorized use of funds not 
stealing bristow said 
he said there was little or no restriction on clarks use of the 
state visa card 
clark testified he never intended to deceive anyone with his 
expense filings 
under crossexamination wednesday clark said he was doing more 
than the law required by keeping expense records no other top 
state official does so he said 
if i wanted to deceive anyone i wouldnt have done anything 
and i certainly wouldnt have used the names of prominent people so 
people could come in and say steve clark says he ate with you is 
that right clark said 
among the prosecutions 141 witnesses state supreme court 
justice jack holt several state legislators lobbyists and 
reporters testified that they didnt eat with clark although their 
names were on his expense claims 
clark claimed he accidentally listed as guests people he talked 
with at the restaurants met earlier in the day or who were topics 
of discussion at meals he said he waited weeks to update expense 
records from memory or notes 
clark denied the states theory that he namedropped on his 
expense claims to hide dates getaways and political engagements 
from taxpayers who footed the bills 
piazza said the attorney general made up the names of guests so 
the expensive meals some more than 500 would appear to be 
legitimate state business 
for your political life didnt you have to justify 500 
meals were you not concerned about how it would look if you spend 
500 to take a girlfriend and her family out to dinner piazza 
said 
juror brenda beall 27 of north little rock said the decision 
was fair to clark and to taxpayers 
i didnt want to see the man go to prison my god he has 
suffered enough but we didnt want him to get away with taking our 
money your money my money she said 
i dont feel in my heart that he is the only one who did this 
the only difference between him and everybody else is he got 
caught she said

exheavyweight boxing champion mike tyson won a 
unanimous decision thursday when a jury decided he should pay no 
punitive damages for fondling a woman in a disco 
the us district court jury of five women and one man 
deliberated less than an hour before deciding tyson did not have to 
pay sandra miller additional damages she had sought 25 million 
as punishment for the dec 10 1988 incident at bentleys disco in 
manhattan 
a day earlier the jurors ordered tyson to pay 100 in 
compensatory damages 
im just happy they saw it as the truth said tyson who 
denied the incident ever happened 
supporters including boxing promoter don king swarmed around 
tyson in the courtroom congratulating him he jokingly pulled a 
100 bill from his pocket and placed it on his forehead 
the jurors left the courthouse without talking to reporters 
miller said she was was happy with the outcome money or not 
it was the principle she said he knows he did it i know he 
did it the jury proved that he did it 
but she said she felt tyson would continue hassling women he 
hasnt learned his lesson theres no stopping mike tyson 
the jury ruled wednesday that tyson grabbed millers breasts and 
buttocks after she refused his advances the finding that tyson 
committed battery cleared the way for a determination of punitive 
damages 
tyson has acknowledged that he was at bentleys but denies 
knowing or ever touching miller a 26year old queens computer 
operator 
in testimony thursday tyson also denied grabbing another 
womans behind that same night at the club 
judge michael b mukasey allowed millers attorney alan clark 
to present testimony about the other incident to show that millers 
claims were not isolated 
the second woman lori davis testified that she felt someone 
clutch under her dress as she was dancing at bentleys 
she said she turned and warned him not to try it again then 
it dawned on me that it was mike tyson she said he was 
grabbing my butt i felt humiliated violated disgraced and 
petrified 
davis a 31yearold mental health therapist has a 7 million 
lawsuit against tyson pending in state court on long island 
clark also questioned tyson about a financial statement that 
placed his net worth at 15 million as of feb 28 
the document showed that tyson owns a 6 million mansion in 
bernardsville nj and cars worth more than 840000 
tyson said he made more than 20 million in 1989 but testified 
that he didnt know his income for this year i had a bad year 
this year he said an apparent reference to his defeat in 
february by james buster douglas 
under questioning by his attorney robert hirth tyson said he 
felt no ill will toward women my mothers a woman and my 
sisters a woman he said 
the civil case was tried in manhattans federal court because 
tysons legal residence is in ohio and miller lives in new york

operation to stave off violence by antiimperial extremists who

akihito

representatives from more than 150 countries including vice

a single campaign by the extremists 
police identified the dead officer as hiroshi aoki 48 he died 
almost immediately after the two blasts just before 11 pm 
ripped through the dormitory in shinjuku a bustling district that 
is one of tokyos most popular nightspots 
two officers were injured one with a serious burn on the back 
of his left leg and the other with a broken left arm and two broken 
legs according to a metropolitan police department official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
he said the dorms cook his son and two other police officers 
also were injured 
the police official said the type of explosives and other 
details of the blast were under investigation the bombs had been 
placed near a garbage collection area inside the dormitory complex 
officials said 
police forces are very angry about the extremists attempts 
and will continue to tighten security for the ceremony to counter 
the extremists challenge the official said 
leftwing extremists are against the institution of the emperor 
which they view as the core of imperialist sentiments among 
conservative japanese 
about 26000 police already are on securityrelated assignments 
in the capital as the enthronement approaches further 
reinforcements would bring the total number of officers deployed in 
tokyo for security to 37000 on the day of the coronation

a state legislator was sentenced 
thursday to five years in prison and ordered to pay 48000 in 
restitution for setting up an illegal bingo hall in 1986 
us district judge thomas higgins sentenced rep tommy burnett 
once one of the most powerful democrats in the legislature on 
charges of illegal gambling conspiracy and six counts of mail 
fraud 
he said he would wait to sentence burnett 48 on an additional 
mail fraud conviction until he served the fiveyear prison term 
its a sad sad day burnett told reporters i think you 
always feel bad when something like this happens in your life 
burnetts lawyer bob lynch in arguments before higgins 
characterized burnett as an enigma a popular successful 
legislator and lawyer who could not manage his personal finances 
and fell deeply into debt 
perhaps i am burnett said when asked later by a reporter 
about the description perhaps sometimes i can do good things and 
sometimes i can do stupid things 
burnett must report for prison jan 2 
burnett faced up to 45 years in prison and fines of up to 175 
million he remains a member of the state house of representatives 
until the nov 6 general election he dropped out of the democratic 
primary for reelection to the seat he held for 20 years and has 
lost his law license because of the felony convictions 
burnett stood with folded arms and fought back tears as higgins 
imposed the sentence 
mr burnett stands before this court a broken man i cant 
think of another better example of a broken man lynch said 
higgins called the case a classic example of basic right and 
wrong and said burnett had clearly stepped over the line 
he said burnett failed to pay the piper when he served 10 
months in federal prison in 1984 for failing to pay his income 
taxes in a timely manner a misdemeanor he was on probation when 
the latest charges were filed 
the 48000 in restitution must be paid to florida businessman 
joseph cappello who served time with burnett at maxwell air force 
base prison camp cappello testified at the trial he gave burnett 
money to set up a bingo hall in crossville 
lynch would not comment on the sentence but he said he will 
appeal 
assistant us attorney robert washko who prosecuted the case 
called it a tragedy 
its a tragedy that stems from a life of financial 
difficulties a lot of it stemmed from is deep indebtedness 
washko told reporters 
washko said he will wait until burnett becomes eligible for 
parole before deciding whether he will oppose burnetts early 
release from prison 
burnett was named in a 10count indictment that accused him of 
conspiracy illegal gambling mail fraud and perjury 
also named in that indictment were knoxville bingo operator 
virginia hurst and columbia businessman ee shutt who were 
accused of illegal gambling and conspiracy 
mrs hurst was sentenced to five years probation and community 
service and ordered to pay a 50000 fine shutt is serving a 
twoyear prison sentence for his role in setting up the crossville 
bingo hall

soldiers in camouflage gear lay 
on their bellies firing automatic rifles and mortars into the 
scrub jungle at tamil rebel positions 
overhead the whine of a siamarchetti attack plane grew louder 
as it divebombed a bunker a burst of 50caliber machine gun fire 
from a bell ranger helicopter slammed into concrete 
tamil tiger rebels replied with automatic rifles the bullets 
kicking up turf and chipping bits from the walls of a hindu temple 
the skirmish was about 1000 yards from kankesanthurai a port town 
on the rebelcontrolled jaffna peninsula in northern sri lanka 
there are only eight to 10 rebels but they are well 
entrenched in concrete bunkers maj deepal subasinghe said 
ducking behind the temple wall 
earlier there were about 30 rebels armed with mortars 
rocketpropelled grenades and rifles but we forced them to 
withdraw from this temple 
subasinghes mission was the final phase of a weeklong 
operation carried out during the monsoon rains of october to 
secure and link three army positions that had been isolated for 
four months under rebel siege 
the operation was called jaya shakthi victorious strength 
in sinhalese the government said its forces captured 16 square 
miles in an arc from the military airstrip at palali to 
kankesanthurai harbor 
it was one of the largest battles in the recent resumption of 
the 7yearold civil war by the liberation tigers of tamil eelam 
the rebels are fighting for a tamil nation in the northern and 
eastern part of the island where the ethnic minority predominates 
reporters taken to the captured zone were shown fortified 
bunkers of concrete and steel and a maze of underground 
communication trenches and tunnels that linked nearly all the 
homes 
we have shifted our defense positions around the airstrip 
giving us a secure area to land aircraft uninterrupted said lt 
gen denzil kobbekaduwa commander of the northern province 
three battalions 3000 soldiers began the operation with an 
advance south of the airstrip a column broke out to the northeast 
and another force moved northwest to relieve the garrison at 
kankesanthurai four miles from the airstrip 
at least 117 rebels and 22 soldiers were killed in the week of 
fighting kobbekaduwa said 
troops suffered 170 injured but only 17 can be considered 
serious he told reporters at the palali airstrip while a field 
cannon boomed in the distance 
a statement from the rebel office in europe said 100 civilians 
were killed and 200 wounded and that at least 32 villages were 
destroyed the rebels said 100 soldiers were killed and 
acknowledged losing 36 tamil fighters 
no civilians were seen in any of the areas visited military 
officials said they had been warned and left before the fighting 
evidence of the guerrillas was everywhere the floor of a 
twostory school at vasavilan had been dug out to make underground 
bunkers 
unopened lunch packets clothing and other personnel belongings 
were strewn in bunkers indicating a hasty retreat 
they fought a series of defensive battles from bunker to 
bunker before withdrawing said lt col abdul zahir 
this was clear at the hindu temple where reporters had to 
crouch and run about 50 yards dodging rebel bullets to reach a 
forward position the tigers had vacated bunkers in front of the 
temple falling back to others at kiramala village about a mile 
away 
at least 14000 people have been killed in the tamil rebellion 
since it began in 1983 
tamils most of whom are hindus claim discrimination in jobs 
education and land policy by the sinhalese who are predominantly 
buddhist tamils make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million 
people and 75 percent are sinhalese 
in may 1989 the rebels accepted president ranasinghe 
premadasas offer to negotiate the resulting truce was shattered 
june 11 when the guerrillas overran several police stations and 
military camps in the tamil region 
kobbekaduwa estimated 2000 rebels were operating on the jaffna 
peninsula about onefourth of the guerrilla force active in sri 
lanka he claimed 2000 had been killed or seriously wounded since 
june 
when asked how he planned to hold the recaptured area the 
general replied 
i am not interested in real estate we want the rebels to 
come we will ambush them and destroy them gradually

many uruguayans look upon the central 
banks thousands of gold ingots as symbols of past prosperity and 
future promise the government sees them as a way to reduce the 
deficit 
a spirited argument has arisen over a new policy of exchanging 
ingots for cash on a swap basis that gives the government the 
right to reclaim the gold later 
this is the national patrimony said ricardo lombardo of the 
opposition colorado party he said the policy compromises not 
just the past but also the future and demands public 
debate 
uruguay is a small country with only 3 million people but has 
one of latin americas largest stocks of gold 31 million ounces 
about one ounce per citizen worth more than 1 billion 
it was earned for the most part by beef and grain exports in 
the first half of the century when uruguays high standard of 
living and comprehensive social welfare programs made it known as 
the switzerland of south america 
the gold lay in the vaults for decades but the central bank has 
swapped 214000 ounces for cash in three transactions since 
president luis lacalle took office in march and prepared for 
others by shipping 800000 ounces to overseas banks 
swap arrangements allow the government to reclaim the gold by 
agreed dates 
lombardo one of three central bank directors said the 
government lost 732000 in the first buyback of nearly 60000 
ounces on oct 30 the gold was immediately swapped the gold out 
again 
the purpose of the swaps is to convert an unproductive asset 
into an investment a basket of foreign currencies for example 
that can earn interest or other revenue and help with the deficit 
another possibility is to use some of the cash to reduce the 
foreign debt now 69 billion foreign banks to which uruguay owes 
16 billion agreed last month to sell the debt at its secondary 
market value about half the face amount 
we cant have a pile of gold in the bank and make 
genuflections or some ritual of a barbarian religion before it 
said ramon diaz president of the central bank we have to see 
what the world is doing what other countries are doing to deal 
with gold as an asset 
when lacalle took office the deficit was 61 percent of the 
gross national product a prime cause of rising inflation that 
reached 15 percent for september alone 
repaying the foreign debt which uruguay has done regularly 
costs nearly 300 million a year few new resources are available 
to finance the government and pay the debt 
even supporters in the presidents national party are nervous 
about the gold swaps 
sen manuel singlet described the transactions as irregular 
and said the public interest cannot be managed this way 
lacalle central bank president diaz and economy minister 
enrique braga have refused to say whether the government will buy 
back more swapped gold 
it is an asset of the country part of the national patrimony 
which we can sell if its more convenient to have foreign 
exchange than gold diaz said 
if cash from the sale of gold is used to buy uruguays debt back 
at half price he said that would be like selling the gold for 
more than 700 an ounce 
sen daniel astori of the leftist broad front coalition an 
economist spoke for the opposition uruguay should not be left 
without gold reserves in order to pay the foreign debt with private 
banks

its a little before 7 am and weatherman 
spencer christian gestures at the bright blue backdrop while the 
magic of television cooks up the maps and graphics you see at home 
good morning america which celebrates its 15th birthday 
friday is about to go onto the air christian is doing the weather 
wrapup for abcs early morning news which originates in another 
studio 
if you dont get into live tv studios very often the surreal 
aspects of a grown man gesturing at a blank wall are quite droll 
if you dont get up that early its not funny its not funny at 
all 
you never get over the adversity of sleep deprivation he 
tells a blearyeyed visitor smiling broadly imagine getting up 
every morning at 345 am no matter what youve done the night 
before 
maybe it would make you gesture at blank walls eh 
since nov 2 1975 gma has originated from the soothing 
dimness of abcs cavernous television studio number two off central 
park on manhattans lower upper west side 
the show with host david hartman and cohost nancy dussault 
was designed by abcs entertainment division as a lighter 
featuredriven competitor for nbc news aging today show which 
had been on the air since jan 14 1952 
the new show beat today in the ratings but today got 
anchor bryant gumbel in 1982 and fought its way back on top 
hartman who left in 1987 is expected back on tv in 1991 with a 
syndicated weekday magazine show 
today was no 1 from 1985 on with gma a strong second 
overall beating the nbc show in key markets and demographic 
groups by 1989 today was fading and gma gaining 
gumbels infamous 1989 memorandum blasting other today 
talent made public the shows internal strains when executives 
engineered the departure of popular and longtime cohost jane 
pauley today slipped into no 2 
its stayed there for 43 consecutive weeks 
today theres laughter and easy banter on the gma set its 
cocoa browns pink pastels and blond furniture are as familiar to 
some americans as their own living rooms and much more 
comfortable at 7 am 
the cohosts settle into the tan couch before two big lowslung 
cameras crossangled for headandshoulders shots the floor 
director relays the countdown silent for the last three seconds 
the cameras red light goes on 
good morning america im joan lunden she says 
and im charles gibson he says and another edition of 
good morning america has begun 
two hours later gibson has interviewed white house chief of 
staff john sununu ms lunden has interviewed a houston woman cited 
for using a stadium mens room and the final hourlong segment of 
a series on aids has aired 
the showis over and ms lunden gibson and christian are 
relaxing on the set none of them has been with the show from the 
start 
ms lunden began as a consumer reporter in 1980 christian 
joined in 1986 and gibson took over from hartman in 1987 with the 
departure of jane pauley ms lunden has become the longestserving 
woman on morning television 
i live here she said i just come down in the morning and 
dust off the sofa 
all three acknowledge that their shows stability has 
contributed to its dominance in the ratings 
i think at this time period in the morning stability and 
consistency is always crucial ms lunden said people 
dont like change its that one time period of the day that you 
dont have the freedom to fool around with it and change things 
and the easygoing amiability that emanates from them doesnt 
fade when the camera goes dark they seem genuinely to like one 
another 
are we conscious of the fact that its necessary to maintain a 
harmonious relationship said gibson absolutely sure you 
have to sublimate your ego which for spencer and i is very easy 
but for joan is very difficult 
barruumpbump 
you talk about moody christian pitches in we never know 
which joan lundens going to show up you talk about the seven 
faces of eve how about the 15 faces of the laughter bubbles 
out of them 
its good to be no 1 in the morning ratings gibson said but 
no one assumes gma cant get knocked out of the top slot 
itll happen he said people will get tired of us and 
well move off and hopefully well be as sanguine about moving in 
another direction as we were about the move up 
 
elsewhere in television 
hamlet returns to pbs kevin kline stars tonight on pbs in 
william shakespeares tragedy of hamlet a prince of denmark 
its also his debut as a director on television in the role 
that won him an obie award when he directed himself in the title 
role onstage 
this sumptuous moderndress tv production is a fine piece of 
work beautifully adapted to the strengths and limitations of 
television its dark intimate obsessive

the newly designated leader at dow jones amp co 
inc won a pulitzer prize for reporting at the wall street journal 
launched the papers asian edition and spent a decade apprenticing 
to the boss at the publishing and business information giant 
but on a wall in his corner office peter r kann displays a 
whimsical drawing of a speckled green fish wrapped in a copy of the 
journal 
the journal publisher selected earlier this month to succeed 
retiring warren h phillips as chief executive of dow jones on jan 
1 is known as a smart lowkey and affable man who doesnt take 
himself too seriously 
he has a funloving streak that makes him a lot of fun to be 
around said the journals washington bureau chief albert hunt 
kann 47 once led wall street journal bureau chiefs on 
latenight golf cart races on a florida golf course he lost 700 
to the papers bureau chiefs in a more recent poker game 
hunt recalls taking kann by then a dow jones executive on a 
1980 campaign trip with presidential candidate ronald reagan 
kann had complained to hunt that the washington press corps 
wasnt tough enough in its questioning of reagan so hunt deferred 
to kann when the pair was invited into reagans cabin on a flight 
between appearances 
pizza was being served as we walked in and they spent the 
whole time talking about pizza hunt recalls 
kann grins when the story is recounted and concedes he got 
taken in by reagans affability 
nonetheless kanns associates say he is a good listener a 
shrewd judge of people a quick study and an able improvisor who 
gets the job done 
former wall street journal reporter seth lipsky told the story 
of how kann got past a skeptical border guard while on assignment 
covering the war in southeast asia in the 1970s after the guard 
rejected every legitimate identification pass offered kann made a 
big flourish and produced a flashy new gasoline credit card that 
impressed the guard who let him pass 
the ability to improvise may serve kann well as he tries to 
steer dow jones through turbulent economic times and toward global 
growth 
the slump in the financial services industry has staggered dow 
jones earnings operating earnings were off 414 percent in the 
third quarter and 311 percent for the first nine months of the 
year 
advertising volume has fallen at the journal barrons and the 
ottaway newspapers subsidiary losses are mounting from a new 
foreign exchange trading system at the companys telerate financial 
information division 
the company recently asked its divisions to hold 1991 spending 
at 1990 levels and boosted the journals cover price nonetheless 
moodys investors service inc cut its ratings this week on 200 
million in dow jones debt 
kann said in an interview he is optimistic that dow jones will 
bounce back when the economy rebounds global expansion also will 
help he said 
the journal for instance became the largest circulation daily 
newspaper in the united states despite competition from three 
national newspapers usa today investors daily and the national 
edition of the new york times and intensified business coverage 
by local papers he said the growth also came despite corporate 
consolidations that eliminated jobs for thousands of middle 
managers who were avid journal readers he said 
the paper has done pretty well in a very tough fiveyear 
period and it has an awful lot of potential to grow again in every 
sense he said 
but is an executive who grew up on the editorial side of the 
business best qualified to guide a company that last year got 57 
percent of its earnings from electronic information services 
kanns supporters note dow jones has a tradition of having 
exeditorial staffers at the helm and say the experience makes 
them better top executives 
the son of a history professor kann was graduated from harvard 
he joined the journal as an intern in 1963 in san francisco worked 
in the pittsburgh and los angeles bureaus and became a vietnam war 
correspondent in 1967 his pulitzer prize in 1972 was for coverage

bush has made no secret of the fact that he would like to see 
saddam out of power but has not made that a stated objective for 
the us military deployed in the gulf their mission he has said 
is merely to push saddam to remove his troops from kuwait and 
restore the previous government there 
however vice president dan quayle on wednesday said in an 
interview on pbs macneillehrer newshour you cannot simply 
allow saddam hussein to have this military power and have the 
technology into the future 
i believe that the world certainly understands that a saddam 
hussein who has ballistic missiles who has chemical capability 
biological capability who would like to have the nuclear 
capability cannot continue to have that capability even if he 
withdraws from kuwait quayle said 
deputy national security adviser bob gates traveling with bush 
on thursday said quayles comments did not indicate a shift in 
us objectives 
bush spent the first half of his day at campaign appearances in 
burlington and mashpee massachusetts for gop gubernatorial 
candidate william weld and senate candidate james rappaport after 
stopping in florida and then cincinnati he was traveling friday to 
minnesota iowa and california 
bush on thursday spent less time blasting democrats on budget 
and other issues and more talking about the gulf crisis 
i want you to put politics aside he told an audience in 
mashpee 
fitzwater said that bush was urged to continue his attack on 
democrats in certain quarters but he surveyed the whole 
matter and decided this was the best approach 
the gulf matter said fitzwater is a very serious and far 
reaching problem and the president wanted to talk about it to 
his audiences despite the potential for allegations that he was 
politicizing the crisis 
we want a public debate over new developments in the persian 
gulf fitzwater said 
as to saddam offer to allow hostage families to visit their 
relatives in iraq and occupied kuwait over the christmas holidays 
fitzwater called it saddams latest ploy and said it would be 
better for the iraqi to let the hostages come home for 
thanksgiving

the cold war is over but not all the spies have 
come in 
markus wolf the east german master spy may be in moscow maybe 
not klaus kuron who tracked wolfs operatives for west germany 
is accused of being a double agent 
germany was a crossroads for spies in the 1930s and became a 
hive of espionage after world war ii when hitlers secret agents 
went to work for east or west depending on where they were 
captured 
spies penetrated the highest ranks on both sides a west german 
chancellor was brought down when his top aide was exposed as a 
communist agent there was a saying in intelligence circles that 
west germany had more spies per acre than any place in the world 
some were captured and exchanged they walked across glienicke 
the bridge of spies that spans the havel river passing each 
other without turning their heads it is easy to imagine the ghosts 
of george smiley and karla lurking there on a silent snowy night 
what of the future cold war or no germany is the center of 
europe the powerhouse that will drive the continent whether for 
industrial political or military purposes the spies are certain 
to be here 
lutz stavenhagen security aide to chancellor helmut kohl 
believes some will be from moscow because what goes on in the new 
germany is of enormous interest for the soviets 
even bonn the dowdy little capital on the rhine has long 
exuded an atmosphere of intrigue 
communist spies infiltrated government offices including the 
chancellery guenter guillaume attached himself to chancellor willy 
brandt the architect of ostpolitik the opening the the east 
and brandt was forced to resign in 1974 
during the war the allies had secret agents in the third reich 
gathering intelligence and aiding the resistance 
immediately afterward berlin was infested with spies a window 
of easy passage for agents hunting secrets 
it was the most productive intelligence collection center in 
the world peter wyden a germanborn american author wrote in 
wall published just before the berlin wall was opened last 
year 
counting the delegations from greece and norway 86 separate 
intelligence operations stumbled over each others tracks in 
berlin he said 
wyden wrote that the cia alone had 40 safe houses in berlin 
at one time as shelters and meeting places for control officers 
and their agents 
in the mid1950s the cia and britains mi6 undertook one of the 
most extraordinary espionage operations of the cold war digging a 
tunnel from which they tapped communications between kgb 
headquarters in east berlin and moscow 
according to wyden and some other writers the soviets knew of 
the operation and played along to protect an important mole in 
western intelligence 
many writers john le carre and wyden among them have 
questioned the competence of western intelligence operations in 
berlin wyden for example points out that the west was surprised 
when the wall went up in august 1961 
le carre transformed spies from superheroes into lonely men 
plying a questionable trade perhaps his most dramatic evocation of 
the image was in the spy who came in from the cold when the 
aging british agent leamas and an innocent friend are shot down at 
the wall victims of a double cross 
the list of real spies who found fame infamy or death in 
germany seems endless 
there was george blake a british agent unmasked in 1960 as one 
of the most damaging sources of information for the kgb 
heinz fiffi felfe a former nazi ss officer hired by west 
german intelligence was considered one of the finest spy fighters 
until 1961 when he was found to be a double agent for the kgb 
wolf the master spy known as misha ran a string of agents 
and moles in west germany who got their hands on some of natos 
most precious secrets 
he scored coup after coup in west germany sending east german 
agents across the border as refugees to infiltrate government 
intelligence and industry wolf ran guillaume who ended brandts 
career as chancellor 
if east german agents couldnt get into the government 
themselves they went after people already there 
intelligence officials tell of one romeo agent who used 
several aliases in seducing west german government secretaries to 
obtain secrets 
in june at koblenz clyde lee conrad a retired us army 
sergeant was convicted of treason for spying conrad who had been 
in charge of a vault filled with classified documents was part of 
a ring that sold army and nato secrets to the soviet bloc 
betraying the information could have started a world war the 
judge said and sentenced conrad to life in prison 
western nations ran their own espionage operations in the 
communist east sometimes with fatal consequences 
double agent horst galau was arrested by east germany in 1985 
and died three years later in bautzen prison east german officials 
said he hanged himself but west german intelligence said it might 
have been murder 
germany is united now but spy scandals continue 
the arrest of klaus kuron might have been enough to destroy the 
government a few years ago his surrender oct 7 however seemed 
merely to underscore the old assumption that east germany had 
seriously compromised west german intelligence 
at least 12 other alleged spies were arrested in connection with 
the kuron case and dozens more are on the run officials say some 
have been taken over by the kgb 
intelligence officers expect spying to continue in germany but 
now that the soviet bloc has collapsed there is no more flavor of 
a morality play 
one shouldnt see this in a moralistic way a german 
official said fashion designers send their own snoops off to see 
what the competition will have in the latest collection thats not 
much different from espionage

by his own reckoning brian 
mashile should have become a blind begger instead he made himself 
into a successful lawyer 
eleven years ago mashile was a poor black teenager who had 
lost his sight in an assault his mother was dead and his father 
worked far from home 
no one in his family had completed high school he lived in one 
of the worst slums of a nation that offers little opportunity to 
blacks even if they are not handicapped 
his options were limited but his determination was not today 
at 30 mashile works for a leading corporate law firm that has two 
other black attorneys 
i am motivated every time i think of the alternative he said 
the alternative would be to go to the streets and become a 
beggar 
mashile succeeded in a country where apartheid laws and crushing 
poverty have made black achievers an exception 
before he was blinded he dreamed of being a doctor but never 
told anyone for fear of ridicule 
in alexandra a poor black township next to johannesburgs 
wealthy white suburbs youthful dreams usually die in the 
daytoday struggle for survival 
goats and dogs roam the streets competing for scraps of rotting 
garbage the pungent smell mixes with eyewatering smoke from coal 
fires and the choking dust of the orange dirt streets 
to leave this was almost beyond my comprehension mashile 
said of alexandra 
he was the youngest of six children in a tworoom house without 
electricity running water or indoor plumbing his mother died when 
he was 10 and his father worked as a gold miner hundreds of miles 
away 
at 16 he quit school to work as a delivery man and saved money 
to return to alexandra high school a year later 
then one night in 1979 four men attacked him and a friend on 
an alexandra street one hit mashile in the face with a wooden 
stick that sent shards of his glasses into his eyes 
he was blinded in the right eye and the left only distinguishes 
light from dark 
in the hospital he cried for weeks 
why me he said you just cant find an answer after you 
cry you get angry and finally you decide to become rational and 
say what am i going to do with my life 
mashiles depression lifted when he fell in love with a nurse 
it was the first time i felt i could be accepted as a blind 
person he said my whole attitude changed 
the relationship didnt last but his motivation did 
in 1981 when he was 21 mashile returned to alexandra high 
school his guidance stick in one hand a portable typewriter in 
the other he graduated two years later with the highest marks of 
70 students 
he was accepted at johannesburgs university of the 
witwatersrand one of south africas most respected schools the 
campus is only a few miles from alexandra but neither mashile nor 
anyone he knew had set foot on its manicured lawns 
mashile painstakingly transcribed classroom lectures into 
braille he had o rely on fellow students to read to him for 
three years as an undergraduate and three more as a law student he 
began classes at 9 am and often would study past midnight 
he never asked for favors said tony leon one of mashiles 
law professors and now a member of parliament he never missed an 
assignment even though everything took him much longer to do than 
it would a sighted person 
for any black to become a lawyer is noteworthy threefourths of 
south africas 40 million people are black but only about 500 of 
the 7000 lawyers are black 
after graduation in 1988 mashile applied to 30 law firms only 
three interviewed him and they were skeptical 
his one job offer came from edward nathan and friedland a 
corporate firm with more than 50 lawyers 
the young lawyer has done everything we expect without any 
special assistance said pierre ferreira head of the litigation 
department where mashile works 
he has applied for a scholarship to study labor law in the 
united states and if accepted into the program hopes to attend an 
ivy league school the university of michigan or the university of 
california at berkeley 
mashile has a voice computer and an assistant whose whose salary 
is subsidized by the government because of mashiles handicap 
beyond that he functions as any other lawyer 
he does not tell clients he is black or blind before they meet 
him they arrive on the 23rd floor of one of the citys sleekest 
buildings to find a handsome young attorney in a conservative suit 
with a thin mustache a wisp of a beard and sunglasses 
welcome you are going to be led by a blind man mashile 
says by way of introduction 
last year another lawyer from the firm always appeared in court 
with mashile this year hes on his own 
hes got a gift for appearing in court ferreira said he 
examines witnesses extremely well because he retains everything 
whereas a sighted person would keep referring back to his notes 
mashile assesses his performance more modestly 
ive messed up some he said ive had judges yell at me 
i dont like it but it makes me know im not getting any special 
treatment 
he still lives in alexandra but in a small modern fourroom 
house with a garden which he shares with two relatives 
from habit mashile rises at 4 am he exercises and is off to 
the glass and steel towers of johannesburg by 7 am 
he jogs often holding hands with a friend who runs at his side 
every friday he visits his old friends at the university and meets 
his girlfriend he still misses playing soccer 
i have achieved many things i once only dreamed of mashile 
said maybe blindness was a blessing in disguise

on one point at least politicians agree 
voters are fed up with politicians but the voters may not do much 
about it in the congressional elections on tuesday 
after all when it comes time to vote the choice is between 
politicians even when the mood is sour and people are complaining 
about congress they tend to approve the performance of their own 
congressmen its other peoples incumbents they want fired 
in 73 of the nations 100 congressional elections at least 80 
percent of the house incumbents who sought new terms got them 
according to a library of congress study it hit 98 percent in 1986 
and 1988 
incumbent reelection rates in the house have exceeded 90 
percent in every election since 1968 save one the watergate year 
of 1974 
the senates incumbent reelection rate isnt quite as high but 
it still points to the advantage of being there 85 percent of 
those who sought new terms in 1988 won them 
house incumbents certainly cant count being as safe as those of 
the 1988 elections when only seven congressmen ran and lost the 
average during the past two decades has far higher 24 
but strategists in both parties agree that this year only about 
25 and certainly no more than 30 congressmen are up against 
challengers who stand a realistic chance of ousting them 
the powers of incumbency are one reason another is that the 
republicans didnt gain seats in the last election when they won 
the white house again they actually lost three 
offyear elections often have reversed the coattail winners of 
the presidential year there arent many to reverse this time 
with 259 house seats democratic strength is the highest it has 
ever been two years into the term of a republican president 
sixtyone incumbents are running unopposed 18 more have no 
major party challenger 
so for all the signs of frustration and anger at congress it 
would take an upheaval of historic proportions for incumbent 
bashing to bloom into wholesale incumbent beating 
but the republicans most visible national campaigners certainly 
are trying president bush says voters can vent their 
frustration their anger and the betrayal they felt by ousting 
incumbent democrats 
the american people are fed up to here with incumbents says 
vice president dan quayle taking his argument to unlikely lengths 
by claiming it is democrats who really are in trouble never mind 
bushs dive in the polls or the discomfort of some republicans over 
administration turnaround on taxes and the worsening economic 
situation 
bush and quayle are talking about democratic incumbents and 
while there are more of them the tactic does have an ironic side 
republicans boasted early in the season of a strong lineup of 
senate challengers with five gop house members running against 
democratic senators now that undercuts their own antiincumbent 
argument those gop challengers are part of the same unpopular 
congress four of the five are trailing in the preelection polls 
the hole in the campaign against incumbency is that while most 
people are saying they dont approve of the way congress is doing 
its job they tend to support their own congressman 
in an abc newswashington post poll 63 percent of the people 
said they disapproved of congress though 64 percent said they 
approved of the job their own member is doing 
bushs job approval rating however was 55 percent down 20 
points in two months 
while that may affect republican fortunes now gov richard f 
celeste of ohio chairman of the democratic governors association 
thinks the longerterm fallout is going to be equally on 
democratic members of congress 
i think people are fed up he said and may show it by 
staying home keeping down the turnout in an off year when it is 
likely to be low anyhow that may be the place where we most see 
the reaction against incumbents 
curtis gans director of the committee for the study of the 
american electorate anticipates a voter turnout similar to that of 
1986 when 364 percent of eligible voters actually cast ballots 
that was the lowest since the wartime election of 1942 
in modern elections the rate at which congressional incumbents 
have returned to office has ranged between 82 and 86 percent 
thats likely to hold too dissatisfaction notwithstanding the 
next congress probably will look a lot like the one that just 
struggled to adjournment

the park ranger leads a gaggle of tourists up 
to the elaborate castiron fence and points to the big violetgray 
house with three styles of greek columns 
this house was built in 1857 the hexagonal bay was added in 
1869 do you know who lives here 
its owner novelist anne rice gives a different tour the house 
as setting for the witching hour her new novel about a line of 
women seduced by an evil spirit that wants to take flesh 
the sunny porch is where the witch dierdre mayfair sat drugged 
senseless but still entranced by her demonic lovers murmurs the 
swimming pool outside was filled with champagne for stella 
mayfairs gaudy parties 
rice points to a tall door in the hallway 
thats the elevator i gave stella the elevator it was 
in fact put in by a woman by the name of pamela starr clapp whos 
supposed to haunt this house but i havent seen her 
rice said mrs clapp lived in the house from 1867 to 1932 and 
shes heard that the previous owners saw her apparition in the 
dining room even though it was said to be a good presence rather 
than a malevolent one rice would just as soon not see it herself 
ive never talked to the previous owners myself i guess i 
should but im scared of the dark and being alone and i dont 
encourage apparitions she said if theyre there i dont want 
to see them im not sure i could survive it mentally 
this from a woman made famous by a series of sensuous novels 
about vampires a woman whose next book is in the frankenstein 
tradition 
the supernatural novel is a wonderful frame for what i want to 
do but i havent seen ghosts myself she said 
what she wants to do is write serious books that are both 
enjoyable and unforgettable though shes also written 
sadomasochistic pornography under the name an roquelaure and 
erotic contemporary novels as anne rampling 
why the supernatural 
i really dont know you might as well ask john updike why he 
writes about new england you write what works for you 
rice 49 also has written two nonsupernatural novels under her 
own name cry to heaven about the 18thcentury opera singers 
who underwent castration to keep their beautiful soprano voices 
and the feast of all saints about the free people of color who 
lived in new orleans in the 1800s 
the supernatural she says allows her to pull together all the 
disparate elements of her life 
i like to talk about history i like to write from a larger 
perspective see our lives as if from the outside all that works 
wonderfully when im writing about an immortal an imagined 
character that is immortal 
her mad scientists creation in in the frankenstein 
tradition also provides an outside view it gives me again the 
grand perspective on humans a way to talk about humanity that is 
completely fresh she said 
the advance from the witching hour gave her the money to buy 
the house she had already finished about five chapters with the 
story set in a different kind of house after moving she switched 
the locale 
the macabre is an occasional note in her decorations a small 
skull on the mantelpiece above her doll collection a lifesized 
carved wooden skeleton in a burgundy velvet chair facing 
12yearold chris minitrampoline 
she and her husband poet stan rice 47 and their son moved 
from san francisco because rice wanted to return to the city she 
left when she was 15 years old 
i was dying to come home i never got new orleans out of 
my blood i would feel cravings for new orleans that were 
positively physical i would turn off songs like do you know what 
it means to miss new orleans 
they moved into another house in july 1988 then bought the 12 
million mansion a few blocks away at 1239 first street in the 
garden district 
the house identified by a plaque on the woven iron fence as 
rosegate the brevardclapp house is light and airy not 
brooding or gloomy 
we spent a lot of time bringing light into it said rice 
it was a great deal darker before we painted it 
the tour continues this halftester bed with the gathered 
green velvet panel high above the head is where both deirdre and 
her ancestor mary beth died antha leaped or was shoved out of 
this manypaned floortoceiling window in the front bedroom 
theyre very very real but the house is real in a totally 
different dimension said rice you know i dont walk around 
this house thinking about the mayfair witches its my house and 
the real history of this house is significant 
eisenhower has visited this house president carter slept 
here and the author eudora welty came here once judge john 
minor wisdom lived here for a year he was a great desegregation 
hero thats more vital to me day in and day out 
park ranger gilbert campa would agree the house has been part 
of the garden district tour as long as the national park service 
has been giving it he said this fence they say is the 
prototype for chainlink fence he told the tourists 
some characters have another peculiar sort of reality 
when rice was a child her mother told her that when charles 
dickens was writing the old curiosity shop people waited on a 
new york pier for the ship carrying the next installment from 
england 
people yelled from the shore is little nell dead the 
captain yelled yes and people sat down and cried i want to 
make people do that 
and in the past couple of years she said two women have called 
rices telephone number is listed to ask if her vampires were 
real when she said no the women burst into tears 
i was deeply deeply touched here was this woman on the phone 
crying because lestat was not real they believed that it 
happened i know i believe it thats a foregone conclusion but 
to make somebody else believe it that was a very very important 
moment 
at least some of the witching hour characters will return 
rice said she hadnt planned a sequel at first but friends who 
read the book wanted to learn what happens to protagonist michael 
curry 
everything i wanted to put in it was there but afterward the 
first people i showed it to would ask what happens next you have 
to get michael out of there is what they would say you cant do 
that to michael

poisonous mercury is spewing unregulated out of the 
nations smokestacks and reaching dangerous levels in soil plants 
and animals 
twenty states from florida to minnesota to california have 
limited or banned consumption of fish from some lakes and streams 
one of the highest mercury concentrations in the country is 
poisoning the oncepristine everglades and has been blamed for the 
death of at least one endangered florida panther 
scientists and environmental groups are pointing the finger at 
two mercury emission sources left unregulated by the environmental 
protection agency coalfired energy plants and the 
fastestgrowing threat trashburning municipal incinerators 
in the past we would take our mercury wastes and bury them so 
they would contaminate the ground water in just one place said 
gary glass an epa mercury researcher in duluth minn now weve 
gotten smarter were blowing it into the air so it can go 
everywhere 
washingtonbased clean water action using data supplied by 
industry and the epa reported last month that 187 incinerators 
nationwide emit almost 75000 pounds of mercury each year ninety 
more incinerators are planned 
massachusetts new york florida and ohio led the list but all 
but four states have incinerators emitting mercury those four are 
planning facilities 
mercury emissions have doubled in the last decade and will 
probably double again if all planned incinerators are brought on 
line warned henry cole who helped write clean water actions 
study 
mercury comes from a variety of sources in trash including 
batteries paints dyes electronics fluorescent lights plastics 
and even yard cuttings which have picked up the contaminant from 
previous airborne pollution 
municipal garbageburning plants spread the indestructable 
mercury by heating it into a vapor that can travel 200 miles said 
paul connett a chemistry professor at st lawrence university in 
canton ny 
the mercury ultimately settles in soil and water it accumulates 
exceptionally well in moist peat helping to explain the high 
everglades readings but a california study found forest canopies 
can collect mercury even under drier conditions 
the poison moves up the food chain concentrating more at each 
level a process called biomagnification from soil it travels to 
plants fish and on to rccoons otters eagles and other 
predators including people 
concentrations found in fish at one minnesota lake have 
increased 5 percent a year since 1970 according to a minnesota 
pollution control agency study 
in humans mercury can damage the brain liver kidney and 
blood and is often characterized by tremors and confusion it also 
causes deformations in fetuses cole is researching whether mercury 
collects in breast milk 
as glass observed incinerators were initially hailed as a 
solution to keep mercury and other toxic wastes out of landfills 
where they often leached into groundwater but only belatedly have 
studies shown that the scrubber and filter technology that cleans 
smoke of toxic gasses fails to work on mercury 
ray morrison mercury project officer for the epa said a recent 
check of california incinerators showed that instead of pollution 
control devices collecting 70 percent of the mercury as expected 
the collection rate is dropping off to zero 
some states have adopted their own mercury emission levels but 
environmentalists say epa acted too little and too late on airborne 
mercury contamination 
there are no mercury emissions limits for the trashburning 
facilities although the agency expects to have some in place by 
december epa spokesman david ryan said 
obviously we think mercury is a problem and we are moving on 
it he said under epa pressure battery makers have drastically 
cut the amount of mercury they use and mercury fungicides are 
being removed from paints 
but ryan acknowledged there are no plans to limit mercury from 
coalburning energy plants believed to be the biggest source of 
contamination in some parts of the country 
epa critics while welcoming the incinerator standards complain 
that even those proposed standards are based on direct inhalation 
of mercury not accumulation in the environment 
in the meantime incinerators face growing opposition 
environmental officials in ontario sued detroits municipal 
incinerator the largest in the united states angered in part 
because of excess mercury emissions that forced michigan to shut 
the facility down briefly in april a trashburning incinerator in 
stanislaus county calif was found to have excessive mercury 
emissions and was told to suspend operations by the state 
the georgia environmental group citizen action has publicly 
blamed mercury contamination in the turtle and brunswick rivers on 
the states only operating municipal waste incinerator nearby in 
savannah 
greenpeace in florida has blasted the giant incinerators ringing 
the everglades on the gulf and southeast coast scientists around 
the world cite the moist peatfilled everglades as having the 
ideal meteorolgical and biological conditions for concentrating 
mercury 
europeans have acted faster than americans in june scientists 
at an international conference in sweden declared airborne 
contamination the largest source of the problem and said 
concentrations worldwide are reaching dangerous levels 
the netherlands imposed tough new regulations on incinerators 
after finding widespread mercury contamination germany where some 
doctors in bavaria warn mothers not to breastfeed because of 
mercury is also tightening restrictions 
clean waters study concludes that tougher regulations and 
better technology are required to deal with mercury contamination 
in the united states 
but environmentalists warn that pollution control is not enough 
mercury they note cannot be destroyed and remains in the 
environment forever 
people have to demand recycling said brian hunt southern 
regional toxics coordinator for greenpeace mercury is a global 
pollutant and there is no pollution control equipment that 
captures all of it we must never never burn garbage

at 19 nancy w became sure she was being 
followed her first symptom of acute schizophrenia that would for 
10 years turn reality into a protean monster holding her hostage 
to delusion and paranoia 
it would drive her to live in a car emerging late at night to 
eat from tin cans in her parents kitchen she was in and out of 
mental hospitals and spent six months roaming the east coast 
alone 
communication became impossible 
she just did not have that ability at all to laugh to 
cry said her father george w of hampstead in a voice as flat 
as the emotional terrain he described 
nancy never will eliminate the chemical mbalance spawning the 
demons in her brain but with a new antipsychotic drug she 
coexists with them in guarded neutrality at 29 she has her own 
apartment in salem and takes courses at a community college 
the drug clozapine marketed as clozaril has elicited similar 
success stories particularly among severely ill people whom other 
medications have failed 
unlike other drugs prescribed for schizophrenia such as 
thorazine and prolixin clozapine doesnt cause involuntary facial 
tremors known as tardive dyskinesia a condition that is sometimes 
irreversible 
many of those cured by clozapine are described as having 
awakened 
george w and his wife catherine saw almost immediate 
improvement in nancy we got our daughter back she got herself 
back he said 
clozapine is touted by many experts as the first significant 
breakthrough in psychopharmacology in 30 years and the harbinger 
of a new wave of antipsychotics but its cost 9000 a year per 
patient has some in the mental health community up in arms 
nationally the food and drug administration estimates 200000 
severe schizophrenics could benefit from the drug but because of 
the cost only about 7000 people are taking it 
pennsylvania will spend 2 million this fiscal year to treat 
schizophrenics with clozapine in state hospitals enough for about 
220 patients officials say there are 4500 schizophrenics among 
the 7000 patients in pennsylvanias state hospitals 
a coalition of mental health groups in pennsylvania has sued 
seeking to require the state to buy clozapine for all eligible 
patients in its hospital system a group of patients in new york 
also has sued trying to force that state to offer medicaid 
reimbursement for clozapine 
in kansas a federal judges ruling requires medicaid to pay for 
the drug 
last month new hampshire approved spending 135000 for the 
drug enough to treat only a few of an estimated 250 people who 
could benefit from it said mental health director donald shumway 
shumway along with counterparts in other states is trying to 
negotiate a lower price with clozapines sole us manufacturer 
sandoz pharmaceuticals corp of east hanover nj 
much of the cost is for monitoring patients for agranulocytosis 
a potentially fatal side effect that reduces the level of 
infectionfighting white blood cells studies have shown the 
condition can be reversed if caught early 
under the monitoring system a home health care company 
distributes the medication each week and collects blood samples for 
analysis 
administrators say the monitoring could be done much more 
cheaply by state hospitals 
shumway tried to cut costs by taking over the monitoring from 
sandoz 
theyre willing to let us do the work theyre just not 
willing to reduce the price once we do the work he said 
six states led by minnesota have threatened antitrust 
lawsuits and legislation has been introduced in congress to make 
the drug more affordable shumway said 
the company wont budge 
all the states are talking to us we have a fixed price for a 
fixed set of services and i dont think that price is going to 
change much said sandoz spokesman david winter 
the root of the problem is that the states dont want to put 
money into take care of the mentally ill he said 
agranulocytosis occurs in 1 percent to 2 percent of patients 
taking clozapine 
shumway said many medications have similar risks and 
manufacturers are never the only ones liable if something goes 
wrong he said the drug is available at a fraction of the cost in 
europe where governments do the monitoring 
remember you have national health systems in europe said 
winter there are obvious differences in the systems differences 
in the approach toward liability and medical issues 
sandoz citing competitive reasons hasnt broken down its 
clozapine costs in the united states while financially strapped 
state governments scoff at what they consider the companys 
liability paranoia and accuse it of reaping tremendous profits 
some doctors sympathize with sandoz 
the litigation issue is an enormous issue said john 
docherty medical director at brookside hospital in nashua nh 
its a big problem in this country if you take a look at the 
number of lawsuits here vs in europe or in japan 
brookside helped test the drug before sandoz began marketing it 
in february 
schizophrenia considered the most disabling and serious of all 
mental illnesses afflicts 1 percent of the us population 
symptoms generally appear in early adulthood and include high 
anxiety confusion language and reasoning problems hallucinations 
and withdrawal 
a lot of times its a problem with how clear you think or how 
able you are to connect your thoughts nancy said in deliberate 
measured phrases 
for her and others clozapine is a protective shield 
its a very good drug for keeping away thoughts that should 
not be there she said it helps keep what is happening in real 
life apart from that which is not there

forestry experts are asking cork oak 
plantation owners and bark strippers to come up with measures to 
stop the rot in the evergreen trees that produce more than half the 
worlds cork 
pests and disease have spread because of years of tree neglect 
attempts to increase production on shallow soil and careless and 
excessive bark stripping an estimated 20 percent of portugals 
cork oak forests have been decimated and infection could reach 
epidemic level experts say 
spain responsible for an additional 25 percent of world 
production is also threatened 
farmers from the worsthit region south of lisbon commissioned a 
fouryear study by lisbons agricultural institute to pinpoint the 
causes and help save trees 
by the time the causes of tree deaths have been analyzed the 
trees might all be dead said joao bentes assistant director of 
portugals forestry commission 
raul sardinha of lisbons agronomy institute said the problems 
date to agrarian reforms introduced after the leftist army 
revolution in 1974 when plantations run by absentee landlords in 
central and southern portugal were turned into cooperatives 
state subsidies promoted growing cereal cash crops among the 
oaks which only turn a profit longterm modern machinery that 
replaced the traditional muledrawn plough damaged the roots of the 
trees 
government statistics show a 14 percent drop in cork production 
from 196977 to 197886 the two nineyear stripping cycles 
some experts say the figure is low only threequarters of the 4 
million acres of cork forest in portugal is in full production 
cork prices have rocketed edmundo pereira president of the 
cork industrialists and exporters association said topquality 
cork sold at 20 cents a kilogram 22 pounds in 1982 while last 
year mediumquality cork fetched nearly 2 a kilogram 
now although some of the land is back in the hands of its 
former owners and government and european economic community aid 
is available to cork farmers theres no rush to plant new oaks 
the man who starts a cork plantation today must have his 
grandchildren in mind said ewan rankin who runs his familys 
forest northeast of lisbon 
it takes 25 to 30 years before an acorn grows into a tree that 
will produce its first harvest he said 
apparently worried about spreading disease the government last 
year hired 300 new rangers to enforce forestry regulations 
particularly regarding cork stripping a craft traditionally 
passed from father to son 
but ranki and others say that is not enough there should be 
more research into genetic growing in nurseries because now its 
only after 30 years that you know whether a tree is of good or bad 
quality he said 
the portuguese wine trade is probably the hardesthit by the 
cork crisis cork stopper quality has fallen as prices have risen 
wineproducing countries like france and the united states are 
threatening to switch to plastic stoppers 
i cannot imagine drinking a good wine with a plastic stopper 
in the bottle it has to do with the dignity with which good wine 
has to be served said jose cyrillo machado of abrigada a 
vineyard north of lisbon 
cork has been used to stop wine bottles since the 5th century

with the tap of a computer key bostons suburbs 
flit by on the screen and youre out on the massachusetts turnpike 
traveling at 12000 miles an hour 
well be in new york in about 40 seconds said stephen 
ervin assistant professor of landscape architecture at harvard 
university 
last year the massachusetts turnpike authority asked harvards 
graduate school of design to develop a framework for the turnpikes 
safety structure and appearance 
harvard dreamed up what is called hypermedia pictures and 
graphs and text all tied together in a database ervin said 
carl steinitz professor of landscape architecture spent four 
days with a film crew taking photos of the entire 135mile highway 
from boston west to the new york border 
steinitz and ervin compiled the photos on computer and linked 
the location of each image to map data the database also includes 
information on local zoning laws and population densities 
we have a connection between visual information what does it 
look like and a map form where is it what are some of the 
attributes about it ervin said 
for example the hypermedia system can confirm visually that a 
certain stretch of road has room for a truckstop it also can check 
to see if the noisy truck stop would be too close to neighborhoods 
steinitz and ervin gave their creation to graduate students as a 
project 
using image processing the students painted in pylons or banks 
of flowers on images of the road on the computer screen they also 
explored putting rest stops close to nature trails or near 
springfield to promote the citys mill town heritage 
it means that you can be very creative ahead of time as you 
make plans for the turnpike said ann hershfang vice chairwoman 
of the turnpike authority 
turnpike engineers want to start using the hypermedia program 
within the next few years hershfang said it can help us with 
accidents it can help us with snow clearing it can help us with 
safety in a lot of ways 
major computer companies are working on hypermedia systems 
which require little new technology but could have a broad impact 
on highway engineering steinitz said 
the system could even help police determine why accidents occur 
in certain places 
do these all happen on a downhill slope in christmas when its 
icy ervin said well we have all the data now to be able to 
check some of that stuff out

for filmmaker victoria stone the brush of 
a gentle tentacle across her lips was quite nice 
the encounter occurred when stone and her partner mark deeble 
who are making a documentary on giant octopuses for the british 
broadcasting corp were diving in puget sound 
one of their eightarmed subjects stretched a tentacle and 
softly touched stones lips the only part of her body not covered 
by wetsuit 
it was quite nice she said i could feel one sucker come 
down and then the next and then the next 
the tender meeting was no surprise to the filmmakers who know 
the octopus as a goodnatured intelligent creature that has been 
miscast as a horror film manhungry villain 
the team also found that octopuses quickly learn to recognize 
people and react to their presence by swimming excitedly 
these are not nonfeeling gooey entities said brian 
baldissin the zoos marine education specialist who has taught 
pacific octopuses how to open a plastic container to get at 
crabmeat inside he and the filmmakers found the animals are adept 
at negotiating mazes and opening a series of doors that swing in 
different directions 
its very dramatic what theyre capable of deeble said 
just from what weve seen i believe octopuses are on a par with 
dogs and cats in terms of intelligence 
the film is scheduled for january in the national geographic 
explorer series on british and american public television

hospital workers who operate xray equipment and 
related hightech machinery say staffing shortages are worsening in 
their field partly because people seeking careers are unaware of 
the opportunities 
a lot of people when they think about careers in health care 
think doctors and nurses said arlene adler a radiology 
educator who met over the weekend with other members of a coalition 
called the summit on manpower 
the summit which comprises 18 groups including the american 
college of radiology and the american hospital association says 3 
percent to 15 percent of hospital positions for xray technologists 
are going unfilled 
for nuclear medicine technologists who use radioactive drugs to 
take pictures of the body vacancy rates also range from 3 percent 
to 15 percent 
for radiation therapy technologists the rates are higher 5 
percent to 21 percent and for sonographers rates are 4 percent to 
17 percent 
government studies indicate that radiological and related 
technology jobs will be among the top 10 in demand by 2000 said 
ms adler director of the radiologic technology program at indiana 
university northwest in gary 
radiology and sonography positions usually require two years of 
course work after high school 
chris hornback an xray technologist in chicago heights said 
starting annual pay is 24000 to 26000 and after five years can 
range from 33000 to 35000 about 600 programs exist for 
radiological technology training and 100 programs exist for each 
of the other fields ms adler said 
 
editors note information about educational programs for 
radiation technology and related fields is available through the 
summits hot line from 9 am to 5 pm est 18004323247

floridas worst outbreak of mosquitoborne 
encephalitis in 13 years has the tourism industry dismissing the 
chances of people catching the virus but still worried that 
visitors might change their travel plans 
the outbreak of the disease has thrown a scare into the 26 
billion a year industry already feeling sluggish from declines in 
the national economy and rising gasoline prices 
but while some local tourist officials feared a disaster there 
have been few reports of trip cancellations 
the majority of calls are from people saying how bad is this 
really said jennifer clark spokeswoman for the palm beach 
county convention and visitors bureau but jack smith executive 
director of the key west hotel and motel association said hes 
seen several groups cancel trips in recent weeks 
so far this year 76 cases of st louis encephalitis and three 
deaths have been confirmed in 23 counties stretching from tampa to 
miami orange county with touristrich orlando as the county seat 
accounts for the greatest number of cases with 14 
flulike symptoms are most common but the young and old are 
susceptible to complications 
the traditional snowbird winter tourist season falls beyond 
the reach of mosquito season state health agency spokesman david 
adams said wednesday weve never had a confirmed case after the 
first week in december 
he said cases being reported now actually were contracted in 
september but tests take four to six weeks to confirm the virus 
realizing the potential for lost business in a state that 
welcomes 40 million visitors each year florida tourism and health 
officials combined on a damagecontrol campaign 
state commerce secretary bill sutton advises in a recorded 
telephone message that the disease has affected only 5 people in a 
million and that resorts have bolstered their pesticide spraying to 
kill the diseasecarrying mosquitoes 
his department has issued an encephalitis fact sheet and travel 
tips to keep tourists coming while advising them to take simple 
precautions they include using insect repellent and wearing 
longsleeved shirts and pants at night when the mosquitoes come 
out to feed 
walt disney world the biggest attraction suspended a campfire 
singalong and an evening water pageant and moved a lakeside luau 
to a hotel but otherwise is operating normally said spokesman 
john dreyer 
we do make our resort guests aware of it with a little flier 
in their room he said but theres really no reason people 
cant come and enjoy the same vacation they could as any other 
time 
some tourism officials say the medical threat has been overblown 
and that state officials share some of the blame but others say 
the state is doing its best to ward off an unwarranted panic 
ronald rose chamber of commerce executive director in jensen 
beach which bills itself as the sea turtle capital of the world 
wrote sutton and gov bob martinez to show his displeasure with 
state efforts 
we may have a disaster in the making for the florida tourism 
industry small retailers and fairs and festivals across the 
state rose wrote earlier this month a suggestion that people 
stay indoors at night has panicked people into shutting 
themselves up in their houses at night 
john rutherford of the orlandoorange county convention and 
visitors bureau already is tired of the media attention and 
offended by coverage by some british tabloids he recalled a 
headline that said brainbug terror strikes brits in florida 
out of 4500 delegates to an american bankers association 
convention in orlando this month rutherford noted only three 
canceled their plans because of the encephalitis scare 
word of the outbreak has spread but travel agencies say they 
are seeing little effect 
out of all of my clients i have had one believe it or not 
who was concerned said tina vespoli manager of creative travel 
in west islip ny about 60 percent of the agencys airline 
tickets are sold for florida destinations

despite a rocky start berlin is back as a world 
destination for air travelers after a 45year interruption 
until airlines changed to a new winter timetable last sunday 
rights to fly the berlin route were closely restricted to the 
airlines of the victorious world war ii allies 
you could fly to berlin from london paris moscow and a few 
other european cities outside germany pan am had four new york 
flights a week otherwise berlin was an international airtraffic 
deadend though for isolated west berlin its air routes were a 
treasured bridge across communist east germany 
the german flag carrier lufthansa was founded in berlin in 
1926 but could not fly to the city frozen out by the special 
rights given to the united states britain france and the soviet 
union as occupying powers of the divided city 
a typical longhaul journey to berlin would mean changing planes 
in frankfurt often to pan am which had the lions share of 
frankfurtberlin traffic 
no more the allies special privileges ended on oct 3 when the 
two germanys united lufthansa paid pan am 150 million for its 
domestic german operations and last sunday lufthansa made its 
first berlin flight in 45 years 
the german airline has plastered the city with ads saying 
were home again and now offers nonstop flights from berlin to 
tokyo moscow and newark nj serving new york 
airlines from other countries including iberia alitalia 
singapore airlines swissair and el al are shouldering into the 
berlin market 
but last sunday a surprise job action disrupted the gala 
welcomes laid on for a raft of new international flights thirteen 
pan am pilots who were supposed to be flying lufthansa flights 
called in sick 
lufthansa spokesman peter hoebel said four flights had to be 
canceled and 40 were delayed as the airlines struggled to deal with 
the unexpected difficulty 
tegel airport was chaotic some passengers waited hours for 
baggage several flights had to share the same departure lounge 
and access roads were jammed with doubleparked cars left by people 
waiting for delayed passengers 
we sent a message to new york asking pan am to work on the 
problem hoebel said and the next day the pilots were suddenly 
well again 
hoebel said the pilots were all americans who have settled in 
germany and want to be taken over into lufthansa as pan am cabin 
crew workers were but they were not part of the takeover deal and 
pan am must eventually find other jobs for them the lufthansa 
spokesman said 
for the time being the pilots are flying old boeing 727s in pan 
am colors under lufthansa flight numbers but lufthansa plans to 
stop using the 727s next year 
despite the startup confusion lufthansa sees a great future for 
berlin as an airtravel hub and expects it to grow to equal 
frankfurt germanys busiest hoebel said 
but the city suffers a lack of capacity even with three airports 
currently in operation and there are only vague plans to build a 
new airport south of the city environmental issues are expected to 
complicate the choice of a site for a major airfield 
meanwhile the former western sector of berlin has tegel airport 
as the main international flight center and tempelhof for 
shorthaul flights in former east berlin schoenefeld airport is 
in operation for longhaul flights 
the soviet airline aeroflot formerly restricted to schoenefeld 
in the east has started daily flights to moscow from tegel in the 
west lufthansa has gone the other direction basing some of its 
flights in schoenefeld

general motors corps 2billion thirdquarter 
loss which includes a huge expense to permanently close four 
plants and stop production at others was viewed on wall street as 
a positive move for the company 
this shows a serious commitment on gms part to improved 
domestic financial performance auto analyst doug laughlin of 
bear stearns amp co said wednesday after gm announced the results 
the loss the biggest in automotive history stemmed from a 
onetime 21billion charge the automaker took for the closings 
of four assembly plants and the idlings and consolidations of other 
factories during the next three years 
during bargaining with the united auto workers late this summer 
the company agreed to guarantee the income of workers laid off from 
plants shut down because of sales slumps the labor costs are part 
of the 21 billion charge 
gm is formalizing the closing of four plants one each in 
pontiac mich kansas city mo atlanta ga and framingham 
mass the four had been indefinitely closed during the past three 
years 
gm common stock closed wednesday on the new york stock exchange 
at 3675 a share up 12 cents that showed that analysts and 
brokers who anticipated some kind of charge during the quarter 
werent especially worried about it 
most charges like this cause the stock to drop sharply said 
auto analyst scott merlis of morgan stanley amp co in new york 
its seen as a positive 
without the charge gm earned 109 million revenues for the 
quarter rose to 308 billion compared with 288 billion during 
the same time last year 
gms profits were far less than expected by analysts last week 
in the third quarter of last year gm earned 5169 million on a 
pershare basis gm lost 354 during the quarter this year 
including the charge compared with a 72 centsashare profit last 
year 
dismal thirdquarter results for each of the big three 
including a lowerthanexpected profit for ford motors co and a 
214 million loss for chrysler corp depict a sputtering auto 
industry 
in all without discretionary charges by gm and accounting 
changes by ford the big three reported a combined loss of 212 
million during the julyseptember period 
there is no question that the quarter is dismal merlis 
said this certainly reflects the further automotive downturn 
induced by the persian gulf crisis 
the sad irony is that the autos have outperformed many service 
companies and banks in the third quarter 
for the first nine months of this year excluding the charge gm 
earned 17 billion down 514 percent from the 35 billion it 
earned during the same period last year including the charge gm 
lost 3687 million 
revenues for the januaryseptember period fell to 948 billion 
from 956 billion 
ford on tuesday reported a 1017 million profit for the third 
quarter but that was inflated by 869 million in accounting 
changes fords profits were cut by 69 million when it bolstered 
its loan reserves at its first nationwide bank subsidiary 
taking into account all accounting changes and the loan reserve 
shift fords profits were 838 million during the quarter 
aside from formalizing the closure of four plants gm also has 
announced that it will stop production at truck plants in 
scarborough ontario lordstown ohio and pontiac mich along 
with closing or consolidating operations of some component plants 
it wasnt clear precisely how many employees would be affected by 
the actions 
i would say the restructuring is being seen as a positive on 
wall street merlis said gm wants to begin the decade of the 
90s with a clean slate and face the reality of the marketplace 
a gm official speaking wednesday on condition of anonymity 
noted that chairman robert stempel immediately ushered in a new 
management plan when he took over from roger smith on aug 1 
you are at the start of a new management team and new 
leadership under bob stempel the official said and one could 
say that better early than late 
why dribble it out

a religious group pressing companies to drop 
advertising from racy television shows has ended a boycott of 
burger king which will run newspaper ads this weekend touting 
support for family values in television 
the activists christian leaders for responsible television had 
singled out the fastfood chain earlier this year because the 
religious group said it found the companys commercials often 
appeared in tv shows that featured sex profanity and 
antichristian stereotyping 
the group said wednesday it reached a mutual understanding with 
company officials it called off the proposed yearlong boycott that 
began sept 1 
it must be stressed that burger king corp did not change its 
principles of its media buying policies as a result of the 
boycott said cori zywotow a spokeswoman for burger king 
we are convinced that burger king shares our concern about the 
quality of television programs and will put that concern into 
practice in the future said billy melvin chairman of the 
religious group that calls itself cleartv 
ms zywotow said the company explained its past and present 
advertising buying policies to the group over the past few weeks 
and said the boycott was called off as a result of those 
discussions 
at the same time she said the company feared its customers may 
have been misled about the incidents and burger king would run 
halfpage ads in newspapers across the country to clarify its 
position 
the halfpage ads which carry the headline an open letter to 
the american people will appear in newspapers this weekend and 
early next week ms zywotow said 
burger king wishes to go on record as supporting traditional 
american values on television especially the importance of the 
family the ads say 
we believe the american people desire television programs that 
reflect the values they are trying to instill in their children we 
pledge to support such programs with our advertising dollars the 
ads say 
ms zywotow declined to say how much burger king was spending to 
run the ads and said she did not know precisely how many newspapers 
would get them 
cleartv is based in tupelo miss and says it includes 
approximately 1600 christian leaders who have a constituency of 
about 60 million people 
while it was not clear what shows burger king sponsored to draw 
the groups wrath cleartv has previously objected to episodes of 
such shows as saturday night live la law and married 
with children 
donald wildmon executive director of the american family 
association a group that is part of the cleartv coalition said 
leaders of the group had encouraged people to boycott burger king 
through church bulletins newsletters and the like and would now 
encourage people to patronize the stores 
ms zywotow said the boycott had no impact on systemwide sales 
for the chain which has 5400 outlets nationwide 
wildmon declined to speculate on whether the boycott hurt sales 
at burger king but added many companies respond only when sales 
are affected

the federal deposit insurance corp has rejected 
an offer by managers of continental bank and a group of independent 
investors to acquire the agencys share of the banks stock 
the fdic on tuesday rejected an offer of 787 per share made by 
the management of continental bank spokesman ted mcdougal said 
wednesday the agency also turned down a similar offer by several 
independent investors 
tuesdays offer was based on mondays closing price of 
continental stock it placed the value of 142 million shares 26 
percent of banking firms outstanding stock controlled by the 
fdic at 1115 million 
the fdic board concluded the offer was not in the fdics best 
interest at this time said spokesman alan whitney 
before making their latest bid continental executives were led 
to believe the fdic would accept a bid at the market price of 
continental stock said bank vice chairman richard huber 
so we got a group together and made a bid at the market he 
said were obviously disappointed we seem to be illfated 
dont we 
mcdougal refused to identify the independent investors who made 
an offer for the shares held by the fdic but he said some of them 
also made an offer in june to buy the stock that group which 
included the tisch family of new york and former treasury secretary 
william simon made an offer of 1550 a share that was rejected by 
the fdic 
the tisch family in october increased its ownership of 
continental bank corp to 85 percent the family including 
laurence a tisch chief executive of cbs inc and chairman of 
loews corp says it is buying stocks of a number of banks for 
investment purposes in the belief bank stocks are undervalued 
in 1989 the fdic canceled a planned public sale of the stock 
when it was trading at 22 a share 
continental officials said they were confused by the rejection 
of offers by the fdic 
im at a loss to explain why they have rejected the third 
marketbased offer in a year nor can i guess what theyre waiting 
for said bank chairman thomas c theobald we have done 
everything possible to make it easy for them to sell 
the fdic obtained its stake in continental bank when the agency 
saved the institution from collapse in june 1984 halting a run on 
deposits prompted by concerns about the stability of the bank at 
the time one of the worlds largest 
the agency has not indicated whether it would seek a private 
placement of the stock or a general public offering

construction spending fell 28 percent in 
september its steepest drop since the last recession the 
government said thursday and analysts said any recovery is at 
least months away 
given what we see now we have several more months to go 
before we can say weve hit the bottom said daryl delano an 
economist with cahners economics in newton mass 
the commerce department said residential nonresidential and 
government spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
4287 billion the lowest dollar level since 4231 billion was 
spent in november 1988 
declines in all categories led to the sharpest tumble since a 
30 percent drop in january 1982 during the 198182 recession 
september spending was 11 percent below the 4334 billion posted 
in the same month of 1989 
the weakness across the board probably reflects the overall 
decline in business confidence to go along with the welldocumented 
decline in consumer confidence delano said 
the conference board a new york research group reported last

federal mismanagement of some of the worlds 
most productive timber lands has cost the government at least 90 
million since 1986 an interior department audit disclosed 
thursday 
mishandling of bureau of land management forests in western 
oregon is the result of financial shortcuts prompted by budget 
cutbacks the departments office of inspector general said 
the report said the blm lost 90 million by failing to perform 
thinning fertilization and other maintenance that resulted in 
fewer trees that could be cut the blm estimated it lost 94 million 
board feet of timber growth in the fiscal years 198689 due to 
inadequate management a board foot is one foot by one foot by one 
inch 
in addition the blm has failed to acquire easements to 132000 
acres with 800 million board feet of mature timber valued at 302 
million 
losses could total as much as 17 billion over the forests 
60to 80year life cycles the report said 
the audit of blm forestry operations on 24 million acres across 
18 oregon counties criticized the agency for failing to explain the 
magnitude of the losses to congress and the office of management 
and budget 
blm director cy jamison said in response to the review that his 
budget requests have been somewhat constrained by funding 
targets provided by the interior department its parent agency 
these targets which are less than ideal to accomplish the 
desired workload are consistent with the goals of the 
administration to reduce federal deficits jamison said in a memo 
to the inspector generals office 
the audit covering fiscal years 198689 noted that blm forestry 
revenues will further decline as additional lands are taken out of 
production to protect the threatened northern spotted owl 
the blm estimated in june that efforts to save the owl from 
extinction may directly affect 23 percent of its lands in western 
oregon about 553000 acres and may indirectly affect another 15 
million acres there 
the blm holdings are some of the most productive timber lands 
in the world said the audit prepared by assistant inspector 
general harold bloom 
bungling of the forest program is especially costly because the 
program historically returns 430 for every 1 spent the audit 
said 
the review questioned whether the blm will be able to achieve 
next years harvest target of 750 million board feet because the 
agencys funding request for its forestry program was more than 20 
percent short of the 66 million needed 
however blm spokesman joe zilincar said thursday that despite 
the lower request congress funded the progam at 665 million he 
said he did not know if that action was a result of the audit 
which was completed more than a month ago but not made public until 
thursday 
the funding that we got this year is right on target with what 
we need zilincar said he said the problems cited in the audit 
will be reviewed 
the audit also discounts blm claims it can use smaller 
fragmented tracts of timber to replace timber from larger tracts of 
forests where logging is being banned to protect the rare owl 
easements for the smaller scattered tracts of timber lands 
have not been obtained because the bureau has concentrated on 
obtaining legal access for the larger consolidated tracts the 
audit said 
in addition the audit said the blm has 
based its budgets on plans to use herbicides to control 
underbrush although herbicdes have been banned on oregon blm lands 
since a federal judge issued an injunction in 1984 manual efforts 
cost three times more than herbicides 
failed to place sufficient priority or secure sufficient funds 
for maintenance of the tree plantations including placing tubes 
around seedlings to protect them from wildlife 
failed to perform intensive management programs including 
fertilization and precommercial thinning to provide proper spacing 
between trees

president mikhail s gorbachevs decree creating a 
new commercial exchange rate for the ruble created confusion and 
chaos thursday in moscows hardcurrency shops 
closed for inventory read a sign at the swisssoviet joint 
venture shop sadko 
sorry i am taking stock said a counterman at the kodak 
film shop at the mezhdunarodnaya hotel in central moscow a cashier 
at the hotel studied a chart listing the different exchange rates 
gorbachev introduced the new rate which took effect thursday 
with the publication on oct 26 of a presidential decree setting 
the value of the currency at 18 rubles to the dollar in commercial 
transactions nearly 70 percent lower than the official rate 
the primary goal of the new rate is to make soviet exports more 
competitive while discouraging imports economic officials said it 
is part of gorbachevs program to switch from central planning to a 
marketbased economy in the next two years 
as of thursday there were three government rates as well as 
the black market price of the dollar these were the official rate 
of 56 rubles the commercial rate of 18 rubles and the special 
or tourist rate of 62 rubles the black market rate is 20 to 25 
rubles to the dollar 
ivan ivanov deputy chairman of the state foreign economic 
commission said the threetier system should be seen as 
transitional while the real value of the ruble emerges 
he described the official 56ruble rate as obsolete but 
said it was being kept for international currency comparisons and 
to protect third world countries whose debts are in rubles 
gradually these rates will be brought together with the 
disappearance of the official and special rates the commercial 
rate will become basic he told the government news agency 
novosti 
but for soviet citizens anticipation of the new devalued rate 
heightened fears that rubles would be worth less and spurred rumors 
that their bank accounts would skrink in value by nearly 70 
percent 
in moscow soviets have been swarming into the handful of 
hardcurrency shops over the past week and buying foreign goods 
ranging from basic foodstuffs to fur coats and car parts 
people heard rumors they are buying everything they can get 
their hands on said a cashier at the sadko shop a favorite of 
soviets who were given the right in august to have and spend 
foreign currency without explaining its source 
the rush came despite assurances the government would reimburse 
anyone whose holdings in bank accounts were decreased by the 
devaluation 
sadko and several hardcurrency shops in major hotels were 
closed thursday morning ostensibly for inventory as bookkeepers 
and cashiers grappled with how to handle the new ruble rates 
we are tripling our prices in rubles said antonina 
maksimova sadkos director however she said customers wouldnt 
feel the difference because the hard currency price they pay is 
unchanged cash registers automatically convert the ruble prices at 
the commercial rate 
at the mezhdunarodnaya hotel ice cream shop the manager said 
in dollars i am charging the same as yesterday although the 
ruble price is three times higher 
at other shops cashiers said they had no instructions we are 
charging the old rate said a register worker at kalinka a 
sovietfinnish joint venture nobody has told us different 
in helsinki finland meanwhile the bank of finland halted 
trade with the soviet union because of confusion over the new 
exchange rates 
kari holopainen director of soviet trade at the central bank 
said the bank was not informed which of the three new rates applied 
to the clearing ruble used in finnishsoviet trade 
to put it mildly we are somewhat unsure of what is going 
on he said in any case we have stopped all payments in the 
clearinghouse trade with the soviet union for the time being 
since there is no official currency exchange for the 
rankandfile soviet the gorbachev decree only affects those 
soviet citizens possessing money earned legally abroad and banked 
in the soviet union in the form of rubles 
none of the three ruble rates now in effect set artificially by 
the soviet government reflect the true worth of the currency 
either to companies trading shiploads of commodities or tourists 
buying souvenir matryoshka dolls 
many companies get around the exchange rates by bartering goods 
such as pepsico incs practice of selling pepsi cola to the soviet 
union and taking its profits out of the country in stolichnaya 
vodka and other commodities

a trw inc division has been accused in a 
whistleblowers lawsuit of inflating bids and doublebilling the 
air force on classified contracts an attorney said thursday 
frank m breene a retired trw acquisitions manager alleges in 
the 20 million federal suit that trw violated the false claims act 
by submitting false bids and falsely allocating costs between 1982 
and 1990 
under the false claims act breene would receive 15 percent to 
20 percent of any damages awarded with the rest going to the 
federal government said breenes attorney david francis pace 
trw spokesman julian levine said the lawsuit was frivolous and 
totally without merit 
trws security and defense sector based in redondo beach 
produces several highly classified systems including spy 
satellites designed to eavesdrop on foreign radio and telephone 
communications 
the specific nature of the contracts in question cannot be 
disclosed because of security concerns the lawsuit said 
breene contends trw intentionally defrauded the government and 
ignored his request that actual accounting figures be used in the 
contract proposals 
the suit does not explain the accounting methods trw used to 
hide any alleged false bids and billings the allegations involve 
complex ratios for allocating costs of production support labor 
and planning 
in general federal rules require contractors to allocate 
contract costs to a variety of special accounts only some of which 
are fully reimbursed by the government 
rules also require that all work performed under a contract be 
paid only from funds in that contract 
breene brought the charges in an amended complaint filed under 
the federal false claims act in june however the charges were 
sealed while the justice department studied whether to join the 
case 
us district court judge edward rafeedie lifted the seal oct 
26 after denying a stipulation to extend the justice departments 
60day study period

the nations industrial sector weakened in 
october pushing the overall economy into a decline for the first 
time in nearly eight years said a closely followed survey of 
purchasing executives released thursday 
the national association of purchasing managements survey 
considered one of the best monitors of the nations economic 
heartbeat contrasted sharply with an assessment tuesday by the 
commerce department that said the economy continue to grow private 
economists agreed with the purchasing managers more pessimistic 
conclusion 
the associations monthly index of economic activity dropped a 
full percentage point to 434 percent in october its lowest level 
since it fell to 428 percent in december 1982 
robert bretz chairman of the trade group said that by falling 
under 44 percent the index reached the point where it signaled a 
small decline in the gross national product the broadest measure 
of the nations economic health 
virtually all the components of the index confirmed the 
growing weakness in manufacturing which was enough to pull the 
overall economy into slightly negative growth bretz said 
the components include production new orders supplier delivery 
rates prices for raw materials inventory levels and employment 
donald ratajczk director of economic forecasting at georgia 
state university said of the purchasing managers report i think 
thats a realistic assessment of the economy 
alan levinson an economist with wefa group a private economic 
forecasting service based in bala cynwd pa also agreed that the 
economy was in a decline last month and added my feeling is the 
recession probably started in august or september 
the purchasing managers survey and the economists were at odds 
with the bush administrations view of the economy 
on tuesday after the release of a strongerthanexpected gnp 
figure for the third quarter commerce undersecretary michael r 
darby stated that the government expected the economy would expand 
at a modest pace in the fourth quarter and next year 
but bretz said of the october results the fourth quarter 
began like the third quarter ended with a decline in the 
manufacturing economy 
the associations survey of purchasing executives at more than 
300 industrial firms around the country found production levels 
fell for the third consecutive month as new orders declined 
sharply 
thirtyone percent of the executives reported production was off 
from the previous month while 52 percent said it was the same and 
17 percent reported production was up that compared with 29 
percent reporting lower production in september 48 percent saying 
it was unchanged and 23 saying it was up 
new orders fell for the fourth straight month 
thirtyfour percent of the respondents said orders were down 47 
percent reported they were unchanged and 19 percent said they were 
up in september 30 percent said new orders were off 47 percent 
said they were the same and 23 percent said they had picked up 
the survey found that export orders grew last month but their 
rate of gain was the smallest in the nearly two years that export 
orders have been tallied by the purchasing managers 
the report also indicated that suppliers deliveries were 
faster a bad sign because it indicated vendors had less demand for 
goods 
industrial companies also felt the bite of inflation in october 
the survey showed its price index rose to 764 percent from 734 
percent in september with the increase blamed entirely on fallout 
from the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
prices for crude oil and chemicals derived from it rose sharply 
but purchasing executives also reported suppliers were using the 
persian gulf crisis as an excuse to make unnecessary price hikes 
employment continued to drop last month a result of the drop in 
production 
twentyeight percent of the respondents said employment fell at 
their companies in october while 63 percent said it was unchanged 
and 9 percent said employment rose in september 27 percent 
reported lower employment 65 percent reported the same employment 
levels and 8 percent said employment was up 
ratajczk noted other evidence that employment continued to 
weaken last month he pointed to thursdays labor department 
announcment that initial claims for state unemployment benefits 
rose by 33000 in the week ended oct 20 to 454000 
the department releases october employment figures on friday 
private economists said they were not surprised by any of the 
numbers announced by the purchasing managers 
none of the components of the index just fell out of bed 
said levinson everything continues to be weak 
added ratajczk this is the beginning this is what you see 
when you are in recession

much this week even on strongerthanusual statements from ranking

prudentialbache securities inc ive read probably 18 times that 
bush said hes had it with the situation i dont know whether 
these things help it or hinder it

republican candidates from farm states said joel karlin an 
analyst with research department inc a chicagobased brokers

lotus development corp trying to fill 
a gap in its product line announced thursday it would buy an 
atlanta software firm for 65 million 
lotus said it signed a merger agreement with samna corp which 
makes word processing products samnas software operates with the 
increasingly popular windows graphical system made by microsoft 
corp lotus main competitor 
windows makes it easier for computer users to operate personal 
computers made by international business machines corp and 
compatible models 
if completed the deal would mark the first acquisition by lotus 
since a proposed 15 billion merger with novell inc another 
software maker fell apart at the last minute in may 
lotus officials said the 1884 pershare buyout of samna would 
represent an important step for the company which saw earnings 
plunge by 63 percent in its most recent quarter 
lotus has been known more for its 123 business spreadsheet 
program but richard eckel a company spokesman said word 
processing is the leading segment of the software industry and 
lotus has been largely absent from that area 
at the same time customers have been shifting to software that 
operate with graphics he said 
buying samna will allow lotus to take advantage of both those 
trends eckel said 
samna will become the word processing division of lotus 
operating from atlanta 
samna had sales of 103 million in the first nine months of 
1990 compared with 11 million for all of 1989 but the company 
posted a 12 million loss over the first three quarters largely 
due to its transition to the graphicsbased system 
lotus had sales of 556 million in 1989 the cambridge company 
said it would take a onetime charge of 40 million to 50 million 
against quarterly earnings when the transaction is completed it 
hopes to complete the transaction by the end of the year

corporate credit card furniture and cash payments some of which 
passed hands in a bathroom and stairwell at the companys offices 
in the gleaming world financial center on the tip of southern

the complaint claimed young received at least 350000 in cash 
and other benefits from contractors between 1984 and 1987 in return 
for promises that they would get business with his employer 
the information alleges that albert young made clear to

announcing the charges 
young 61 of manhattan pleaded innocent to conspiracy mail 
fraud and two counts of tax fraud he was released on a 250000 
bond

were awarded said merrill lynch vice president patrick murphy who 
is in charge of the firms security 
we started to get complaints from vendors who were trying to 
do business with us and from merrill lynch employees that something 
was wrong in the way business was being done murphy said i 
think that the complaint covers as much as we know about the 
activities

morgan stanley amp co said thursday it was laying 
off about 6 percent of the investment banking division as rumors 
swirled on wall street of major cuts at another big firm 
the reductions come during a prolonged downturn in the financial 
industry that has seen thousands of layoffs management overhauls 
and reductions in major business sectors 
morgan stanley spokeswoman jean andrews said the firm the 
second most profitable on wall street last year with 443 million 
in earnings planned to cut 50 professionals from its worldwide 
investment banking staff of 800 by the end of the year 
the division includes mergers and acquisitions corporate 
finance real estate and capital markets all areas that have been 
hit hard by the decline in the securities industry since the 1987 
stock market crash 
andrews said the cuts would be across the board including some 
senior executives 
its in response to the current and expected business 
environment for the industry she said managing in this 
environment you always look at what resources you commit to these 
businesses 
morgan last week reported a 29 percent drop in thirdquarter 
earnings to 719 million from 101 million in the same 1989 
period the firm attributed the decline to a sharp drop in merchant 
banking and investment banking activity 
the announcement of layoffs at morgan came as rumors circulated 
widely on wall street that first boston corp was planning a major 
restructuring to include hundreds of layoffs in coming days 
also thursday the new york stock exchange said it was freezing 
executive salaries for 1991 and enacting an early retirement plan 
in an effort to trim about 8 percent of its staff next year 
earlier this week merrill lynch amp co the nations biggest 
securities firm announced a major restructuring that is expected 
to result in hundreds of layoffs 
if people arent bringing in business youre running a 
loss said perrin long an analyst with lipper analytical 
securities corp you cant sit back and say times will be get 
better well just keep the people 
first boston workers said talk has focused on staff cuts of up 
to 10 percent involving investment banking and backoffice 
personnel to be announced early next week the rumors also were 
reported in the wall street letter a weekly trade publication 
this week 
a first boston spokesman said the company continuously reviewed 
its businesses and some staff reductions were expected by the end 
of 1990 but the spokesman said talk of specific layoffs on a 
specific date were unfounded rumor and speculation 
it looks like there is a consistent overcapacity vis a vis 
customer and client demand well shrink said the spokesman who 
asked not be identified by name 
first boston a division of cs first boston inc has struggled 
because of the slump affecting all of wall street as well as large 
junkbond bridge loans to cororate clients that could not be 
refinanced

digital equipment corp which has slashed its 
payroll without laying off workers may find it more difficult in 
the current economic slump to induce people to leave their jobs 
company president kenneth olsen said thursday 
but olsen also said the computer manufacturer should do well 
during a recession and outperform most of its competitors 
olsen gave the assessment to shareholders at the companys 
annual meeting the gathering followed a tough year for digital 
the worlds secondlargest computer company behind international 
business machines corp 
the company posted its firstever quarterly loss in july and 
announced plans to cut its work force by more than 5000 jobs 
through a costly voluntary severance program previously digital 
had cut its payroll by 3000 positions 
olsen said the company with sales last year of 13 billion and 
a worldwide work force of 123000 hopes to continue avoiding 
layoffs 
but he added we never have said we wont never say never 
about anything 
when asked if the gloomy economic climate makes it more 
difficult to get people to give up their jobs olsen said 
probably it turns out normal attrition slows down at bad 
times 
company spokesmen said it is too soon to tell how receptive 
workers have been to the latest round of voluntary cuts 
you dont stay in business for 33 years without continuously 
adjusting your staff olsen said we always make adjustments 
we always will we plan to be in a fastchanging business 
forever 
he said however i feel confident that we will do well in a 
recession that does not mean we will live like we do in good 
times but that we will do better than most of our 
competition 
shareholders at the meeting repeatedly expressed concern about 
what digital is doing to improve its profitability digitals 
stock which approached 200 per share before the october 1987 
stock market crash lately has been worth about onefourth that 
amount on thursday it closed at 4862 a share up 112 
olsen said despite recent troubles digital is in a strong 
position having invested 15 billion in new products last year 
and holding 16 billion in cash 
part of the companys new strategy is to change its vax 
computers so they can run software designed for the popular unix 
operating system that means companies equipped with both vax and 
unixbased computers could run the same software for all 
reflecting a trend in the computer industry toward open rather 
than proprietary systems 
unix is fun exciting olsen said our strategy is to do 
it all 
analysts say digital like some other massachusetts computer 
companies has been hurt by a slump in the market for midsize 
minicomputers their functions have increasingly been swallowed by 
powerful desktop machines called workstations 
but olsen disputed the notion of a minicomputer slump claiming 
workstations fit within that category 
still he predicted the computer industry will undergo 
fundamental changes the world needs very few computer 
manufacturers just like it needs very few auto manufacturers he 
said 
olsen who founded digital and is now 64 years old also told 
shareholders he does not foresee retiring before he has a chance to 
see current strategies come to fruition 
i am more enthusiastic than ever he said

ibm agreed to pay a scottish manufacturer of 
computer memory devices an undisclosed amount to settle a patent 
infringement suit the two companies said thursday 
the settlement could result in other payments by computer makers 
to the company rodime plc since its patents cover the most widely 
used type of internal memory device for personal computers the 
3inch magnetic hard disc drive 
in rodimes opinion a large number of the 3inch disk drives 
being manufactured do infringe on the patents said john 
altmiller an attorney with kenyon amp kenyon in washington dc 
who represents rodime 
neither international business machines corp nor rodime would 
disclose the size of the lumpsum payment ibm made ibm spokesman 
brian doyle did say that it would have no effect on the companys 
earnings 
as part of the settlement ibm and rodime also agreed to 
crosslicense each others patents covering the disk drives the 
companies said 
is this a win for rodime and a loss for ibm no we dont 
think so doyle said we felt both parties would be getting 
something out of it it was a negotiated settlement each party 
believed that the other was using its patents 
james swent rodimes chief financial officer said rodimes 
primary aim was to gain acknowledgment from the worlds largest 
computer company that rodimes patents were valid 
rodime based in glenrothes scotland also has a lawsuit 
pending against conner peripherals inc of san jose calif a 
major disk drive maker that suit was stayed pending the outcome of 
the ibm suit swent said 
obviously the two companies will be in discussions and we will 
have to decide whether we continue the stay he said by telephone 
from rodimes us headquarters in boca raton fla 
he added that he expected similar discussions would take place 
with other makers of 3inch disk drives 
we expect to enforce our patents we would hope that it would 
not involve litigation he said 
rodime which makes its disks in singapore and scotland 
reported a loss of 415 million including a restructuring charge 
of 12 million for the fiscal year ended sept 30 1989 swent 
said revenue totaled 96 million

ousted centrust chairman david paul whose swank 
personal life has come to symbolize excesses in the savings amp loan 
crisis is fighting a 308 million restitution order from thrift 
bailout regulators accusing them of an alice in wonderland 
approach to due process 
paul faced a deadline thursday for submitting securities to 
cover the claim from the office of thrift supervision but his 
attorneys won a delay until a court hearing is held probably next 
week 
pauls response doesnt answer specifics of the government 
complaint which charges the head of floridas oncelargest savings 
and loan immersed himself in luxury ranging from 1100anight new 
york hotel suites to flownin european chefs in order to satisfy 
his insatiable vanity and ego 
instead his attorneys challenged the legality of the oct 22 
order saying any alleged misconduct occurred before the bailout 
law was passed last year 
paul 51 reportedly is the subject of a federal criminal 
investigation for his centrust reign but no charges have been 
filed to date 
his attorneys charge the governments demand for the 308 
million imposes unprecedented and oppressive conditions in 
that it purports without legal authority to seize all the 
personal assets of paul and his family 
the civil proceedings are an alice in wonderland approach to 
due process where execution comes before the trial pauls 
attorneys charged 
they asked for a speedy hearing but us district court judge 
edward davis hadnt set one by thursday afternoon 
thrift regulators went after paul amid congressional pressure to 
recoup some of the billions of dollars in losses associated with 
the sampl crisis the federal takeover of centrust last february is 
costing taxpayers 18 billion 
a 15 million legal defense fund for centrust officers and 
directors was described by regulators as a slush fund that 
included centrusts most marketable securities leaving the sampl 
with poorer quality securities us district judge federico moreno 
on wednesday upheld the governments seizure of the fund 
pauls lavish ways have long been a subject of public scrutiny
