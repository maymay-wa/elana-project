calls were pouring in from people wanting 
to adopt a newborn abandoned on christmas but the infertile couple 
who found baby nicholas will not get special consideration 
officials said tuesday 
its not a finders keepers situation said john runde a 
spokesman for the state department of health and rehabilitative 
services 
steve and robbi carroll discovered the baby sunday wrapped in a 
patchwork quilt in the parking garage at sarasota memorial hospital 
and took him into the hospital where staff members nicknamed him 
baby nicholas in honor of st nicholas 
the baby almost 7 pounds with brown hair and blue eyes was 
estimated to be three to four days old tuesday he was found clean 
wellcared for and had a bottle of warm formula with him 
we found him and we should get to keep him said robbi 
carroll 33 we both fell instantly in love with him hes such a 
pretty baby i dont understand how anybody could abandon him 
but its more important to do whats best for the baby and 
thats placing him with an approved permanent family as soon as 
possible said bob miller the executive director of the gulf coast 
division of childrens home society in st petersburg 
millers private agency has 50 families already approved to 
receive an infant a process that can take several months he said 
if the baby is put up for adoption a private agency such as 
childrens home society probably will handle the case runde said 
but first state officials will try to find the parents or other 
relatives of the baby said argylene bridges a foster care adoption 
supervisor with hrs 
police were in the last stage of the investigation calling area 
hospitals about recent births said sarasota police spokesman mike 
schott sarasota memorial officials say theyre certain the infant 
was not born at their hospital 
millers agency had received some 60 calls about baby nicholas 
mrs bridges said she received a couple of dozen 
steve carroll 30 called the baby a a gift from heaven and 
said that he hopes he and his wife can adopt him the sarasota 
couple have been married for 13 months but said they are unable to 
have children of their own 
we had talked about adoption last year when we first got 
married he said a lot of people told us we could have put him 
in the car and drove off but we would have had to live with our 
conscience carroll said 
the carrolls were coming to the hospital to visit robbi carrolls 
mother when they found the baby

once known as the city of hate dallas again 
feels the nations critical stare this time over a judge who said 
he gave a killer a lenient sentence in part because the victims were 
queers 
this is another blow to the image of dallas which is why 
theyre treating it so seriously said attorney don maison who 
has represented the dallas gay alliance dallas doesnt like to be 
embarrassed 
state district judge jack hampton made the remark dec 16 in 
explaining to the times herald why he sentenced an 18yearold to 30 
years in prison instead of life the minimum sentence was five years 
these two guys that got killed wouldnt have been killed if 
they hadnt been cruising the streets picking up teenage boys 
hampton said i dont much care for queers cruising the streets 
picking up teenage boys ive got a teenage boy 
in a city of just under 1 million and an estimated homosexual 
population of 80000 those words sparked protests from residents 
and civil liberties groups some charged that the remarks could 
spell open season on homosexuals 
elected officials such as state treasurer ann richards and sen 
edward m kennedy dmass expressed outrage 
for dallas which became known to many as the city of hate 
after the assassination of john f kennedy in 1963 it was another 
of the reminders including racial incidents and the 25th 
anniversary of the assassination that have reinforced the citys 
reputation among some as an uncaring place 
hampton has since apologized to a group of ministers for his 
poor choice of words but gay rights leaders said thats not 
enough and are pressing for his resignation a complaint was filed 
with the state judicial conduct commission that could result in 
hamptons removal 
the judge did not return calls from the associated press and 
after issuing his apology thursday left town for the holidays 
hampton sentenced richard lee bednarski on nov 28 for the 
murders may 15 of tommy lee trimble 34 and lloyd griffin 27 who 
were shot three times each 
testimony indicated that bednarski who had no prior criminal 
record was part of a group of youths who went to an area frequented 
by homosexuals with the intention of harassing them 
bednarski persuaded another youth to join him in robbing trimble 
and griffin who had invited the boys into their car testimony did 
not reveal whether the victims actually solicited sex from the two 
youths 
william waybourn president of the dallas gay alliance said 
reports to his organization of violence against homosexuals are on 
the rise i think theres an epidemic of violence against gays 
because of aids the fear of aids he said 
he cited an educator at his groups aids resource center who was 
beaten with a baseball bat in october by two men who yelled an 
epithet for homosexual 
many members of the legal community would not discuss hamptons 
case specifically but said the publicity about the case could hurt 
the judiciary 
state district judge jesse oliver said i think there is always 
a concern about things that put judges and the judiciary on the 
front page and on the six oclock news it doesnt do very much for 
the image of the judiciary 
mike joplin president of the dallas bar association said he 
does not believe antihomosexual bias prevails in the dallas legal 
system some lawyers disagreed 
m william nelson a lawyer who estimates half his clients are 
gay said he believes judges in dallas in general have 
antihomosexual prejudices 
but most of them are going to have the good sense not to tell 
them to a reporter whos sitting there writing down every word you 
say he said 
he added however that hampton is generally a fair judge and has 
shown compassion toward prisoners with aids 
other lawyers who consider themselves friends of hampton said 
they believe his opinion on homosexuality is shared by a majority of 
the community 
lawyer bill mcknight one of about 50 people who demonstrated in 
support of hampton on thursday blamed the lunatic fringe the 
liberal media and groups such as the american civil liberties 
union for the national attention the case has brought to dallas

dozens of western firms have teamed up 
with soviet enterprises to take advantage of new rules allowing 
joint ventures as part of moscows push for perestroika 
the new partnerships many still in the planning stages may 
eventually offer soviets a variety and quantity of goods and 
services not readily available in their underdeveloped economy 
they also may give soviet president mikhail s gorbachev some of 
the western technology knowhow money and management expertise 
sorely needed in his program of perestroika the drive to 
restructure the lumbering economy 
the soviets have much more to gain from this generally than 
western partners said jan vanous research director of planecon 
a washingtonbased firm specializing in forecasting economic trends 
in the soviet union and eastern europe 
they need to improve their economy on the domestic side and one 
instrument of course would be to improve foreign economic 
relations said a nato official who demanded anonymity 
sen bill bradley dnj has urged caution 
we should applaud perestroika but we shouldnt pay for it 
he said in an interview on the macneillehrer newshour 
bradley said the economic reforms appear directed at cutting 
soviet defense expenditures and bolstering the civilian sector 
to the extent that trade and joint ventures can promote that 
kind of reform then i think its in our interest he said to 
the extent that it retards it i dont think its in our interest 
vladimir kamentsev head of the soviets state foreign economic 
commission recently said 159 joint ventures with foreign partners 
have been registered analysts said this likely includes some 
arrangements with east european countries as well 
some of the reported deals are 
the west german electrical giant siemens has proposed a 560 
million joint venture to build an atomic power reactor a german 
tavern owner wants to open a pub in leningrad 
the british joint venture rank xerox plans to team up with the 
soviet state publishing group fto vneshtorgizdat for a photocopying 
shop in moscow the deal is worth less than 18 million 
a consortium led by japans mitsubishi corp has agreed to 
conduct feasibility studies on a proposed 5 billion chemical 
project in western siberia the project would involve building 15 
chemical plants another japanese company raduga is interested in 
sports and health centers 
spains telefonica de espana will make telephones with the 
soviet ministry for production of communication media at a factory 
in the ural mountains another spanish firm kelme has joined with 
the soviet state committee for sports to turn out sports shoes in 
leningrad kiev and outside moscow 
in italy ente nazionale idrocarburis enichem is considering 
two petrochemical joint ventures including a 6 billion project 
with occidental petroleum and two other international partners 
the italian clothing chain stefanel wants to open two shops in 
leningrad also the agricultural concern ferruzzi has agreed to 
build an agroindustrial prototype on 12 million acres of ukrainian 
farmland 
finnair the finnish airline has signed up with the soviet 
tourist agency intourist on a hotel project for foreign visitors 
irelands aer rianta wants to work with the soviet airliner aeroflot 
on an airport dutyfree shop 
theres no indication how many of the partnerships have actually 
begun operations but analysts believe the number is small and their 
investments are limited 
according to reports cited by analysts about 500 million rubles 
roughly 830 million has been committed in capital by both 
soviet and foreign partners an estimated onethird of the total has 
been put up by the west 
its a very slow process said vanous nobody is doing any 
volume of production 
there is still a lot of chaos and confusion added willy 
vandenberghe spokesman at the belgian foreign trade ministry it 
is still a very young phenomenon 
ralph land a general manager of britains rank xerox said 
negotiations to open the photocopying shop in moscow were lengthy 
we didnt always speak the same language he said im not 
talking about english and russian our concept of profitability our 
concept of cash flow our concept of depreciation were different 
dutch electronics giant philips has no plans to follow others 
lead 
joint ventures are like marriages youve got to know each 
other very well before you plunge into it said spokesman jan van 
schagen right now philips and the soviet union arent even 
engaged 
the soviet union issued a decree on jan 13 1987 and 
legislation was approved months later permitting the formation of 
joint ventures with foreign partners 
only about two dozen were registered in 1987 but the campaign 
picked up in 1988 
western companies have been lured by a potential market of 280 
million consumers 
the analysts suggested the partnership push has been prompted by 
the soviets desire to boost consumers living standards expand 
export capacity with more competitive goods and gain access to 
western technology knowhow and management skills 
the soviets also according to these analysts want to limit 
imports from the west which require them to make payments in scarce 
hard currency such as dollars the ruble is not convertable outside 
the soviet union making it viturally worthless 
the soviet union recently sought to ease restrictions on these 
arrangements by scrapping the limit on foreigners share of a joint 
venture and allowing a foreigner to head the operation 
hiring and firing rules have been simplified tax breaks have 
been offered to manufacturers willing to put up factories for 
consumer goods medicine trucks and high technology as well as to 
joint ventures operating in the soviet far east 
even so western companies still face difficulties 
they cannot convert profits made in rubles into dollars or other 
hard currencies and take them out of the country the soviet economy 
cannot provide an adequate and reliable supply of goods companies 
need in their operations and westerners must deal with an 
entrenched soviet bureaucracy that can slow business ventures

a congressman who has been a perennial budget 
workhorse and a senator who has spent his career focused on other 
issues will be marquee players in what should be one of 1989s most 
clamorous political clashes how to cut the federal deficit 
rep leon panetta dcalif and sen james sasser dtenn each 
are becoming chairmen of their chambers budget committees in time 
to wrestle with 35 billion in needed deficit cuts and incoming 
president george bush has pledged to achieve the cuts without new 
taxes 
both lawmakers are in general agreement that mopping up the red 
ink with spending cuts alone is a dubious approach in interviews 
sasser said making up the shortfall without new taxes makes it 
less likely that youll have success while panetta said what 
are needed are spending cuts and you have to raise revenues 
the two men are also lawyers but similarities between them dont 
go much further 
panetta 50 is from monterey calif and began his political 
life as a liberal republican he left the gop after losing his job 
as director of the civil rights office in president nixons 
department of health education and welfare in 1970 after 
complaining about the agencys lack of aggressiveness 
he gravitated to the democratic party but still keeps an 
autographed picture in his office of the late earl warren the gop 
california governor who became the liberal chief justice of the us 
supreme court 
sasser 50 was chairman of the tennessee democratic party from 
1973 to 1976 a tenure that ended with his defeat of incumbent gop 
sen william e brock the memphis native who has been reelected 
easily twice since then is a moderate liberal who has prospered in 
a conservative state by tending to its needs on the appropriations 
committee and by taking populist positions against government waste 
and high interest rates 
panetta has worked on budget matters since coming to congress in 
1977 in 1981 he was chosen by house democratic leaders to help 
find 37 billion in spending cuts that newly elected president 
reagan had rammed through congress the job pitted the green 
lawmaker against house committee chairmen schooled in protecting 
their turf and panetta to this day calls that period his toughest 
budget battle ever 
he also helped shape the grammrudman deficitreduction law and 
was a negotiator at last years budget summit between reagan 
administration officials and congressional leaders colleagues from 
both parties say they respect his knowledge of the budgets 
intricacies and consider him fair 
he really knows what makes the budget tick and what makes it 
explode said sen pete domenici of new mexico ranking republican 
on the senate budget committee hell be a team player for the 
democrats but that doesnt mean hell turn fiscal and budget policy 
into a partisan confrontation 
hes a workaholic says rep charles schumer dny one of 
three lawmakers with whom panetta shares a capitol hill townhouse 
during the week well all have dinner and then go upstairs to 
watch tv and hell go back to his office and work until 1 am 
panetta says his years in the gop give him a pretty good sense 
of how republicans think and many members of that party give him 
high marks for fairness 
some republicans however have never forgotten that panetta 
oversaw the 1985 house task force that ruled that a disputed house 
race in indiana had been won by the democratic candidate by four 
votes at the time fellow task force member rep william m thomas 
rcalif accused him of political rape 
sasser has been on the budget committee for all of his dozen 
years in the senate but he has not been considered a leading player 
in the field and admits that the subject has not been the focus of 
his attention 
but he says i dont feel like a neophyte and i dont 
underestimate the difficulty of the task 
the tennessean is best known for speaking out against 
administration policies in central america and picking through 
government spending looking for waste and fraud he was chosen to 
deliver his partys response to a reagan speech on nicaragua in 
early 1986 but for the most part has received little national 
publicity 
hes not a real attentiongrabber says lance simmens a 
former sasser aide who is now a lobbyist hes more in the mold of 
a judge who sits back and listens to both sides and doesnt shoot 
from the lip 
sasser says he believes the reagan budgets of the last eight 
years have not devoted enough resources to domestic programs such as 
education health care and transportation and sewage systems yet he 
says he will not try to force his views on his committee 
i want to come up with an approach that would try to hold a 
consensus within the committee for certain budget priorities he 
says 
he insists he has no preference for whether new taxes are needed 
but says of bushs campaign pledges to beef up education and 
childcare programs i dont see how he can realize those 
initiatives without addressing revenues 
panetta is more direct he says that if bush is flexible on the 
question of taxes cooperation between the white house and congress 
would be likely 
if he fails to do that we in congress certainly are not going 
to abandon our responsibility he said we will have to proceed 
but it will become much tougher for us to do our job

for george bush to succeed in his quest to go 
down in history as the education president he will have to spur 
american schools to achieve results that have proved elusive despite 
intensive reform efforts 
the gaping federal budget deficit will make it difficult for bush 
to find new money for schools beyond what he promised during the 
presidential campaign 
if bush concentrates instead on simply trying to advance 
education through use of the bully pulpit he may find ronald reagan 
has already played that role to the hilt 
reagan never said he wanted to be an education president when he 
entered the white house the main item on his education agenda was 
to abolish the department of education he failed and was largely 
rebuffed on repeated attempts to cut billions of dollars from 
federal school programs 
but reagan also presided over the most intense and prolonged 
period of school reforms in the nations history 
his first secretary of education th bell commissioned the 
1983 report a nation at risk that triggered efforts in most 
states to raise school standards his second secretary william j 
bennett made headlines pillorying the education establishment and 
championing parents rights in public education 
the public responded to the alarms sounded in a nation at 
risk and the literally dozens of other diresounding reports that 
followed it by pouring more money into the schools the average 
public school teacher today makes nearly 30000 a year salaries 
have risen 45 percent since 1982 double the rate of inflation 
but there has been little evidence to date of any dramatic 
improvements in educational achievement more than a quarter of 
american teenagers drop out of high school there have been only 
piddling gains in scholastic aptitude test scores which fell 
steadily from 1963 to 1980 and among major developed nations 
americans continue to bring up the rear in comparisons of students 
knowledge of math and science 
lauro f cavazos the recently appointed secretary of education 
whom bush has asked to stay on said in a recent interview 
although we have made some advancements weve fallen back in some 
other areas we have not been able to stem the tide of dropouts 
our literacy numbers are terrible 
cavazos is convinced the american people must not recognize the 
seriousness of the problem or else theyd have gone out and done 
something about it 
bush has said repeatedly he does not envision any massive new 
social spending programs 
he has said the nation must spend more wisely on education 
and he has said educators must be held to the highest standards of 
accountability he has voiced support for giving parents more 
choices within public education for career ladders for teachers and 
for alternate certification of new teachers 
the cornerstone of his campaign promise to be an education 
president is a new 500 million merit schools program that 
would reward high achieving schools that have large numbers of 
disadvantaged students with unfettered grants of up to 100000 
bush has said it will be up to the states to set the criteria for 
choosing the winners 
he also has promised to ask congress for an additional 50 
million in matching grants to states for magnet schools and he 
wants to boost to 50 million a 6 million fund to finance 
experiments in school reform 
congress appropriated 219 billion for the education department 
for fiscal 1989 or 7 billion more than its budget in 1981 when 
reagan moved into the white house 
the nations total education bill has risen steadily in the 
1980s from 183 billion in 198081 to an estimated 328 billion for 
the current school year the kindergartentograde 12 share of that 
bill has gone from 112 billion to 196 billion adjusted for 
inflation it is up 26 percent 
education groups say the federal share has not kept pace with 
inflation the government which kicked in more than 9 percent of 
local public school bills in 1980 now pays just 62 percent most 
of the federal money is targeted on programs for the poor the 
handicapped and students who speak little or no english 
likewise federal aid for college is also targeted on the needy 
although middleclass students also benefit from loan subsidies and 
workstudy programs 
congress and reagan have beaten bush to the punch on one campaign 
promise taxfree us savings bonds for parents to save for college 
tuition starting next july college lobbyists have welcomed that 
step but say it primarily will help middle and upperincome 
families that can afford to save not the needy 
bush has reiterated plans to hold a summit next year with the 
nations governors education leaders and others to discuss the 
problems of the schools and how to solve them 
albert shanker president of the american federation of teachers 
said it sounds like a conference at which he tells the governors 
that its their job but he added anything that keeps education 
on the front burner is good 
weve made some little bit of progress very little said 
shanker i think if you had a commission up there today theyd 
have to say the nation is still at risk 
business leaders have become increasingly visible in the school 
reform movement serving both as boosters and gadflies the 
committee for economic development has called for massive increases 
in spending on such programs as head start and the chapter one 
remedial program without a better educated work force they argue 
the united states can only lose ground to its competitors in the 
international marketplace 
at a joint economic committee hearing dec 14 john brademas 
president of new york university and a former congressman said 
education is the perfect issue with which republican president 
george bush can build bridges to a democratic congress 
he urged that bush throw his weight behind a bipartisan effort to 
expand international studies and research including the teaching of 
foreign languages rebuild deteriorating campus labs and scientific 
facilities and provide grants instead of loans to needy college 
students

a curtailment of federal grants has left state 
government officials wondering if their new drug enforcement 
programs may share the fate of drug busts gone sour 
state and local antidrug programs begun with such promise just 
two years ago could be crippled or even killed unless the federal 
government provides sufficient money officials say 
it was congress in the electionyear 1986 antidrug bill that 
urged the states to establish multiyear drug law enforcement 
programs in order to receive new grant money 
states and localities responded by hiring new police officers 
prosecutors and lab technicians and by having clusters of police 
forces band together in regional drug operations 
now state officials are accusing congress of unashamedly claiming 
credit for the statelocal assistance program and then failing to 
deliver on the promise to provide sufficient money 
people feel megadollars are flowing to the states to 
benefit local programs said bruce feldman executive director of 
pennsylvanias drug policy council thats really not the case 
were having to fight that pr battle 
j david coldren of the illinois criminal justice information 
authority said this is all smoke and mirrors theres less money 
per pound of rhetoric than ever before 
the states are right said rep william j hughes dnj 
chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee on crime we cant 
have a love affair one year and the next year walk away from the 
state and local assistance program we have treated the states 
shabbily 
hughes promised to fight for additional funds and blamed the 
curtailment on the reagan administration which has tried to 
eliminate the program 
the lawmaker said we were lucky to hold onto what we had 
barbara clay spokeswoman for the white house office of 
management and budget said we believe federal money would be 
more appropriately spent on federal drug efforts such as us 
attorneys prisons and the drug enforcement administration where 
there would be a national impact 
we believe state and local governments have obligations to 
increase their own budgets for their own localized activities 
clay said 
according to the federal funds information for states a project 
of state legislative and governors associations grants distributed 
under a congressional formula totaled 1784 million in fiscal 1987 
dropped to 556 million in fiscal 1988 and made a partial comeback 
to 1188 million in fiscal 1989 
the gap between the first and third years actually is greater 
because in 1987 states could supplement their grant money with an 
additional 355 million in separate justice assistance funds 
for the 1989 fiscal year the justice assistance program was 
combined with the statelocal grants program thus eliminating the 
additional source of funds 
many states used their firstyear money to establish regional 
police operations in which small and mediumsized departments 
banded together to fight drug dealers 
new officers were hired solely for the antidrug effort and new 
equipment such as surveillance vans was purchased 
some states needed to move cases to court faster and they hired 
more prosecutors crime laboratory technicians and lab analysis 
equipment 
in one of the more novel programs illinois established a 
lending arsenal allowing local police to borrow from the state 
police an array of equipment they couldnt afford to buy 
miami used grant money for a reverse sting operation in which 
police drove drug dealers out of an area substituted undercover 
officers as sellers and then arrested the buyers 
tom quinn executive director of the criminal justice council 
which represents states on crime issues accused federal lawmakers 
of pennypinching in the area of our largest concern the drug 
problem 
we have not had to drop anything we started but we cant 
expand pennsylvanias feldman said we need 5 million to 
maintain the programs we have 
coldren said that in illinois the drop in funding has meant we 
had to freeze out a number of counties that would love to have drug 
programs 
in maryland capt thomas carr commander of the state police 
narcotics division said his states programs could keep operating 
another year 
it remains to be seen where were going to go in the following 
year but all of us know the drug problem is not going to go away in 
a year he said 
florida made only a twoyear commitment to local agencies 
knowing it could maintain the programs for that period said john 
lenaerts an official in the state department of community affairs 
if we establish a program we dont cut them off at the 
knees he said 
g albert howenstein jr director of the california office of 
criminal justice planning said to this point we have been able 
to sustain the program but down the road if we continue at the 
same level of financing by the end of the third year we will 
see a negative implication 
in montana the scaleddown money will leave the north central 
area of the state without any antidrug programs said marv dye 
finance manager for the crime control division of the state justice 
department 
and in texas where some grant money is used to stop drugs on the 
southern border theres a strong possibility of program 
eliminations or acrosstheboard reductions said john coffel 
director of the states narcotics control program

the 101 million tax forms being mailed out 
starting today will contain a surprise for some taxpayers the forms 
they receive will be different and simpler than the ones the 
internal revenue service mailed to them last year 
despite widespread grumbling that the drive toward tax 
simplification has instead produced a more complicated system the 
irs is predicting that 35 million americans will be able to switch 
to the simpler forms this year 
to help make that projection come true the irs is making a 
greater effort this year to direct taxpayers to the form that is 
best for their tax situations 
the irs formerly mailed taxpayers the type of form they had used 
in the previous year however for the first time this year the irs 
analyzed the returns taxpayers sent back last april 15 and used 
those findings to determine what type of package to send for the new 
filing season 
instead of routinely sending out the same form people used in 
the past we are trying to send them the tax package that best suits 
their needs says irs spokesman frank keith 
the landmark 1986 tax reform act reduced tax rates raised the 
standard deduction and eliminated a variety of deductions those 
changes mean many taxpayers who once found it beneficial to itemize 
deductions and file the long form 1040 can now use the simpler form 
1040a or the simplest form of all the 1040ez without being forced 
to pay higher taxes 
the tax packages which cost the government 294 million to 
print and mail have been waiting at post offices around the country 
for the past several weeks with instructions to begin delivering 
them today 
the mass mailing is the largest the government does each year and 
traditionally is scheduled for the period right after christmas 
for the first time this year the irs is supplying estimates of 
how long it is likely to take taxpayers to fill out the various 
forms this information irs officials hope will encourage 
americans to use the simplest form possible 
the irs estimates that form 1040 will require a taxpayer to spend 
3 hours and 7 minutes on record keeping 2 hours and 28 minutes 
learning about the law 3 hours and 7 minutes preparing the form and 
35 minutes for copying assembling and sending the return to the irs 
the 9 hours and 17 minutes total does not count an additional 5 
hours and 51 minutes the agency estimates a taxpayer will need to 
fill out an accompanying schedule a used if the taxpayer itemizes 
deductions and schedule b used to list income from interest and 
dividends 
by contrast the irs estimates a taxpayer needs only 1 hour and 
31 minutes to complete the 1040ez the simplest irs form which can 
be used only by single people who do not itemize and who have 
taxable income below 50000 
the 1040a the other short form may be used by married or single 
people who do not itemize and whose taxable income is less than 
50000 
as in years past officials were estimating that threefourths of 
all taxpayers will receive refunds the typical refund last filing 
season was 91474 
in addition to mailing tax packages the irs makes the forms 
available at many banks post offices and libraries 
the irs said taxpayers should notice few changes this year 
unlike last year when taxpayers had to confront for the first time 
the sweeping changes made by the 1986 tax reform act 
among the changes that will show up in the 1988 tax forms 
tax rates will be reduced reflecting the lower rates that took 
effect starting last jan 1 under the new law most people fall 
into either the 15 percent or 28 percent tax bracket although some 
affluent taxpayers pay a hidden 33 percent tax rate on some of their 
income 
the individual exemption has been increased from 1900 to 
1950 while the standard deduction for those who do not itemize 
will go up as well for single people the standard deduction goes 
from 2450 to 3000 the deduction for a married couple filing 
jointly rises from 3760 to 5000 
clarifying language and graphics have been added to help people 
select the proper standard deduction and the correct dependency 
status two areas which proved confusing on last years forms

with part of the holiday gorging season still 
to go a consumer advocacy group is offering a list of food and 
nutrition tips as new years resolutions 
during 1988 the surgeon general let americans know that what 
we eat has a lot to do with our health says public voice for food 
and health policy that means the nations chief doctor has added 
his voice to other public health authorities including the american 
heart association and the national cancer institute in strongly 
advocating a diet lower in fat and higher in fiber 
therefore public health said in the coming year give 
yourself a longer and healthier life by observing a few simple 
rules in the supermarket at restaurants and at neighborhood schools 
guidelines urged by the washingtonbased group include 
read nutrition labels and try to choose lowerfat foods keep 
total fat per day to about 80 grams for men and about 60 for women 
watch for hidden fat in processed foods gourmet ice cream for 
example can have up to 20 grams of fat in one serving 
buy select beef the leanest grade rather than the fattier 
prime or choice grades 
beware of highly saturated coconut or palm oil in prepared 
foods look for it in the ingredients statement particularly on 
baked goods 
if there is no nutrition label on the supermarkets own brand of 
food ask for it 
get involved in what children are eating in school work with 
the pta and school dietician to encourage the school to offer more 
nutritious lunches and snacks including those in vending machines 
those should be lower in fat sodium and sugar and higher in fiber 
buy wholegrain bread and rolls for sandwiches and side dishes 
seek out lowerfat alternatives to ice cream such as ice milk 
frozen yogurt sherbets sorbets or frozen fruit juice bars 
try to use fresh fruits for desserts and sweet snacks look for 
creative recipes in healthconscious cook books 
public voice also said that when dining out look for heart 
healthy menu items as recommended by the american heart 
association if no special menu items are listed ask for them 
choose meals that are baked broiled or grilled without heavy 
sauces 
ask restaurants to provide healthier kids menus going beyond 
traditional hot dogs hamburgers and french fries the group said 
see if you can order half an adult portion of a lowerfat menu 
item such as one grilled chicken breast instead of two

congress is sprucing up for its 101st twoyear 
session and the celebration of 200 years of constitutional 
government 
one more bicentennial as the century nears a close 
the senate chamber in particular will have a fresher look when it 
convenes jan 3 
a new carpet has been installed royal blue with medallions 
and the staff benches in the rear have been reupholstered in bright 
crimson it should give the chamber a flashier look on television 
a few months ago the staff area in the back corners of the 
senate chamber were enclosed with massive mahogany railings that 
also was done with television in mind 
some senators with desks in the rear of the chamber had 
complained that when they rose to speak the television image of the 
speech showed them with rows of dangling feet and crossed legs at 
the level of their own heads the new railing provides a more 
senatorial visual backdrop 
the taking up of the old carpet which had been in place for more 
than a decade and was badly worn in places was an event in itself 
workmen in jeans and casual clothes took the places of senators 
in crisp threepiece pinstriped suits 
some lounged in senators arm chairs told jokes in loud voices 
flicked cigarette ashes on the chamber floor and ground out the 
butts with their heels 
then they carried the 100 historic desks out of the chamber door 
and propelled them down the corridor to temporary storage 
then they tore up the carpet 
looks just like the revolution one bystander said 
the tearing up of the carpet attracted spectators and souvenir 
hunters a few of the latter were united states senators 
senators and senate pages and clerks rolled up swatches of the 
old carpet and carried it away on their shoulders 
the chamber now has been restored to order ready for noon on 
jan 3 when 10 newly elected senators one newly appointed senator 
and 23 newly reelected senators will raise their right hands and 
swear to support and defend the constitution of the united states 
against all enemies foreign and domestic 
all seats in the senate galleries have been allocated to 
relatives friends and supporters of the new and returning senators 
for the first time a spillover room has been set up for guests 
of the new and reelected senators who cannot be seated in the 
senate chamber itself they will be issued tickets for seats in the 
senate caucus room in the russell senate office building where they 
will view the swearingin ceremonies on a 9by12foot video screen 
the actual swearing in will be followed by a reenactment in the 
old senate chamber 
the reason a photo opportunity a chance for each senator to be 
photographed with presidentelect bush acting in his vice 
presidential role as president of the senate 
the following day jan 4 bush will preside over a joint session 
of congress in the chamber of the house of representatives for the 
counting of the votes of members of the electoral college 
there bush acting again as vice president will announce that he 
has been elected president of the united states

ronald reagan leaves office with his personal 
popularity intact but with americans viewing him unfavorably on 
many policy issues a media generalassociated press poll has found 
most respondents viewed reagans performance negatively on social 
and governmental issues such as education and ethics a majority 
also rated his judgment unfavorably 
yet reagan retained his enormous personal approval a vast 
twothirds endorsed the way he has done his job overall many said 
history will view him positively and 55 percent said he has made the 
country better 
the national survey of 1084 adults found two factors at the 
heart of reagans popularity high ratings for his leadership and a 
belief that his economic policies the past eight years have been 
good 
reagan also was scored highly for his handling of defense and 
ussoviet relations and he was seen as an effective president 
more than six in 10 said he has accomplished most of what he set out 
to do 
the survey was conducted nov 1020 shortly after vice president 
george bush was elected reagans successor despite reagans 
popularity a majority said they would not have supported him for a 
third term as president 
he leaves office jan 20 
reagans ratings were high on personal qualities twothirds 
ranked his leadership ability as excellent or good and 
threequarters favorably rated his charisma and his ability to 
communicate 
six in 10 also ranked him positively for his accomplishments in 
office overall but reagan did less well on another attribute his 
judgment as president with 53 percent rating him negatively 
reagans popularity flagged on social issues on civil rights 51 
percent rated him negatively on education 54 percent were 
negative on housing 65 percent on welfare 67 percent also six 
in 10 rated him negatively on his handling of ethics in government 
respondents were about evenly split on another issue reagans 
selection of federal judges but on two other issues he scored 
strongly seven in 10 rated him favorably on defense eight in 10 on 
ussoviet relations 
the poll gave four options per issue excellent or good 
as positive choices only fair or poor as negatives reagan 
fared worst among democrats but was seen negatively by independents 
on several issues republicans endorsed him on most issues but not 
on the deficit welfare or housing 
reagans ratings were mixed even on economics while nearly 
twothirds said his economic policies have been beneficial 80 
percent negatively viewed his handling of the federal budget deficit 
moreover 54 percent said the poor are worse off economically as 
a result of his policies and 72 percent said wealthy americans are 
better off opinion was more divided on the middle class a third 
called it worse off a quarter said it was better off and the rest 
saw little change 
thirtyfive percent said they and their families were better off 
as a result of reagans efforts to just 18 percent worse off but 
when asked to score his handling of the economy respondents split 
half viewing him positively half negatively 
on another issue foreign policy excluding soviet relations six 
in 10 viewed reagan favorably the poll was conducted before he 
opened contact with the palestine liberation organization this 
month so it did not measure that moves possible effect 
in nearly all the gauges of his popularity reagan did best with 
young adults ages 1829 and worst with the oldest 65 and over he 
also did considerably better with men half the men polled but just 
37 percent of women said they would have backed reagan for a third 
term if he could have run again

a liberal open enrollment law that lets 
students switch schools for anything from history class to 
extracurricular hockey worries some educators and parents who fear 
it could severely unbalance minnesota schools 
residents of small towns are worried that under a new state law 
considered the broadest in the nation by educators too many 
students will flee little districts unable to offer the variety of 
courses available in bigger districts 
theyre deathly afraid theyre going to lose their school it 
makes them sick at heart said richard pearson the state 
department of educations acting manager of district support 
services thats unfortunately a real possibility 
under the plan passed by the legislature in may the states 
large districts must give students the right to transfer without 
giving a reason beginning in the 198990 academic year the law 
permitted some schools to adopt the policy this academic year it 
will apply to smaller districts in 199091 
schools may refuse students only if the transfer would interfere 
with desegregation ratios in minneapolis st paul and duluth or if 
the school is too crowded 
while the law was intended to enhance academic not athletic 
opportunities the minnesota state high school league which 
regulates sports also is concerned about the open enrollment plan 
my sense is a lot of people are worried said dave stead 
executive director of the league which has 472 member schools 
gary addington supervisor of athletics for rochester public 
schools said he hopes transfers solely for athletic reasons dont 
become widespread it could create great inequities between 
schools as far as competitiveness he said 
the education commission of the states headed by gov rudy 
perpich is planning a national conference on open enrollment and 
other education options for feb 2324 in minneapolis said robert 
wedl deputy commissioner of the state department of education 
only two districts edina an affluent minneapolis suburb and 
rural sartell in central minnesota met a sept 30 deadline to 
notify the state they will not admit students from other districts 
in 198990 pearson said 
sartells decision was based on lack of classroom space pearson 
said edina with its highly regarded school systems said it 
wouldnt as a general rule accept transfer students but would review 
applications individually pearson said 
members of a commission appointed by the governor to study 
education issues said edinas decision set a precedent for other 
districts to reject open enrollment and could be viewed as a move to 
keep minority students out 
edina officials deny that saying parents expressed concern 
during school board meetings about students abusing the academic 
intent of the law 
the principle abuses are with regard to athletics specifically 
that of students selecting another school district for the purpose 
of participating in varsity sports within that school district 
rather than for reasons of quality education dennis maetzold an 
edina school board member said monday 
school officials say they hope districts such as edina that 
decline to accept students across the board will be rare 
we hope they change their minds we believe its good public 
policy to have open enrollment said wedl by closing its doors 
to its neighbors it represents a clog in the policy

a whopping art swindle unfolding in a french court 
has all the ingredients of a bestselling thriller set in the 
highbrow world of museum curators and wealthy collectors 
take paris venerable louvre museum add a painting by a 17th 
century spanish master stir in convicted fortune hunters shady 
lawyers and the mysterious death of a wealthy heiress voila the 
de canson affair 
the case centers around the purchase of bartoleme esteban 
murillos stunning portrait the gentleman of seville for the 
louvre by its head curator of paintings the curator pierre 
rosenberg was charged last week with dealing in stolen property in 
connection with the case 
the intrigue might well have gone unnoticed had suspicion not 
been cast on the louvre and a host of highprofile lawyers 
including paul lombard who is known for handling the estates of 
pablo picasso and marc chagall 
lombard was charged last wednesday with complicity in falsifying 
legal documents also in connection with the case 
the legal document at issue is a will falsified by a former bar 
manager who stood to inherit paintings worth 50 million from 
suzanne barou de la lombardiere de canson and sold the murillo to 
the louvre 
the bar manager joelle pesnel had befriended the wealthy 
heiress and moved into the widows home in 1983 as a confidante 
for some time before her 1986 death mrs de canson was held 
prisoner in a locked room newspapers have reported 
miss pesnel was convicted and jailed a year later for 
sequestering mrs de canson and for failing to help her when she was 
in danger newspapers have linked the heiress death to the 
conditions in which she was kept 
the louvre had looked into purchasing the murillo portrait as 
early as 1975 and in 1981 rosenberg picked up where his 
predecessors left off writing to mrs de canson who owned the 
painting when the museum received no response the matter was 
dropped 
but four years later rosenberg learned the painting was to be 
auctioned by christies in london and that it was now the property 
of miss pesnel 
the murillo portrait however never went on auction and the 
louvre purchased it in 1985 for five million francs now 833000 
from miss pesnel through her attorney lombard france has strict 
laws forbidding the export and sale of works of art that the state 
is interested in obtaining 
several years later during a police probe prompted by mrs de 
cansons family members miss pesnel told investigators she 
inherited the murillo and other paintings from her grandmother who 
had received them as a gift from mrs de canson she produced a will 
to prove her story 
the investigators found miss pesnels grandmother had died four 
years before mrs de canson and miss pesnel met 
miss pesnel has since been convicted and imprisoned for theft and 
falsifying her grandmothers will a toulouse attorney who had 
recovered some art for mrs de canson robert boissonnet also was 
convicted and sent to jail on the same charges 
the investigating magistrate jeanpierre bernard accused 
rosenberg of purchasing the painting with the knowledge that it was 
illegally acquired 
the louvre quickly came to its own defense 
olivier chevrillon head of frances national museums told 
reporters at a news conference dec 14 the louvre never had at 
any time or from any source any reason to doubt the origin of the 
murillo 
it often happens that paintings change hands this one was on 
the market and that could have been the case he said 
chevrillon said the museum had no intention of returning the 
murillo to the de canson family 
we cannot be faulted for not verifying ownership because under 
french law possession of a work of art is considered ownership 
chevrillon said

a rapist charged with attacking a woman while 
on furlough from patuxent institution may help doom the 
maximumsecurity prison devoted to treating violent offenders rather 
than punishing them 
coming on the heels of reports that a patuxent review board had 
granted unsupervised furloughs to a triple murderer legislative 
leaders are threatening to abolish the therapeutic institution 
believed to be the only one of its kind in the country 
i just dont think that it works said r clayton mitchell 
jr speaker of the maryland house of delegates who has called for 
the firing of the prison director norma gluckstern it has proved 
it hasnt worked furloughs and that sort of thing for those types 
ought to be abolished 
criminal justice experts say the furor over patuxents early 
releases and furloughs epitomizes a national fear of crime that 
george bush exploited to defeat michael dukakis in the presidential 
campaign 
the republican candidate blamed dukakis after convicted murderer 
willie horton came to maryland while on furlough from a 
massachusetts prison and raped a woman 
the majority of the prison systems across the county have been 
reexamining their furlough programs in view of the recent national 
political campaign said hardy rauch director of standards and 
accreditation of prisons for the american correctional association 
in college park 
patuxent operates independent of the rest of marylands penal 
system with a review board that grants furloughs and recommends 
paroles based on its determination of whether any of the 710 inmates 
have been rehabilitated 
the prison focuses on therapy to make inmates remorseful for 
their crimes 
since 1982 five inmates who were sentenced to life terms at 
patuxent have been paroled after spending an average of nine years 
in prison a little more than half the average for inmates sentenced 
to life in marylands other prisons 
state and federal statistics for 1987 show that three years after 
release 18 percent of patuxent inmates were convicted again 
dramatically lower than 476 percent for marylands other prisons 
and 38 percent for federal prisons 
but ms gluckstern said she is worried that patuxents success in 
reforming its inmates will not weigh strongly enough to ensure that 
the prison survives 
im fearful policy is going to be made on extremes 
patuxents director said the final issue is do these people have 
a second chance 
some insist they dont 
there is no early release from the grave said wisconsin 
appeals court judge ralph adam fine an advocate of punishment for 
violent offenders 
the fate of the victim and a future victim is forgotten once a 
criminal is convicted he said 
last week maryland corrections secretary bishop robinson called 
for sweeping reforms at the prison changes that would essentially 
abolish the institution as it now exists 
robinson recommended to a special legislative committee studying 
the prison that patuxents independent status be revoked and that 
prison officials be stripped of their broad authority to put inmates 
convicted of violent crimes into furlough and workrelease programs 
but he said the institution should accept prisoners serving terms 
of 20 years or less more than 86 percent of the prisoners now at 
patuxent are serving life or longterm sentences for murder rape 
and armed robbery 
ms gluckstern acknowledges that many patuxents inmates have 
committed heinous crimes but maintains that many criminals can be 
responsible members of society after treatment patuxent admits just 
one in four inmates who apply based on the review boards judgment 
of their capacity to change 
no one gets out of here until they live through their crime 
that rape or that murder or whatever she said once inmates 
accept responsibility and guilt for their deeds theyre not going 
to go rape or murder again she said adding it doesnt 
guarantee 100 percent success 
patuxent has intermittently come under fire since it was created 
in 1955 
the most recent controversy began in november with the disclosure 
that the patuxent board had given 11 daylong furloughs since april 
to robert daly angell 31 who was sentenced in 1976 to three 
consecutive life terms for killing two police officers and a 
teenager 
angells furloughs outraged gov william donald schaefer who 
directed aides to revamp the prisons rules for the legislatures 
review 
then james m stavarakas a convicted rapist walked away from a 
work release job on nov 28 he was captured dec 4 in china grove 
nc 
after a warrant was issued charging stavarakas with rape while he 
was missing ms gluckstern and the prisons independent review 
board canceled all leaves as of dec 1

theres an art to whining properly says the 
founder of national whiners day 
kevin zaborney urged people to set monday aside for a whine and 
cheese party or go to a department store and whine around the 
lines of people returning christmas gifts 
the 24yearold monroe man said he got the idea for whiners day 
and selected the day after christmas because of his retail 
experiences 
a very highpitched childlike tone of voice is what makes it 
special he said 
but those who celebrate the day are likely to do it alone 
according to university of michigan psychologist christopher 
peterson 
there have been studies showing that people who are glooomy and 
pessimistic turn off other people and dont have as many satisfying 
relationships he said ultimately the way we act comes home to 
roost on us 
zaborney doesnt plan a big todo although he did name his 1988 
cowhiners of the year evangelist jimmy swaggart and former ptl 
club cohost tammy faye bakker

his name was carlos rosa he was 19 years old and 
he died violently the suspect and motive behind his killing are a 
mystery but drugs are believed to have played a role 
those are the bare facts behind what was in every sense a 
typical killing in new york city in 1988 carlos rosas death on 
christmas eve stands out for only one reason it may have broken the 
record for the number of new york city homicides in a single year 
rosa who was shot to death near his home on staten island late 
saturday was the 1842nd homicide victim of the year according to 
sgt diane kubler a police spokeswoman by some counts the 1981 
record was 1841 killings although police said later that 1826 
homicides took place that year indicating the record could have 
been broken earlier 
on christmas day seven more people were killed about 30 more 
homicides are expected by new years 
no american city comes close to new york in volume of violent 
deaths the city averages five homicides a day its closest 
competitor los angeles averages fewer than three 
other cities do have much higher homicide rates new york ranks 
10th among major american cities in number of homicides per 100000 
people the most murderous city in the country is detroit 
new york reached its 1981 peak in violence during a period of 
fiscal retrenchment in which the number of police officers had 
declined throughout the early 80s as the city rebuilt the police 
department and national crime rates fell the number of homicides 
each year declined 
but the numbers have been increasing for several years and 
criminal justice experts are virtually unanimous about the cause 
crack cocaine 
its not surprising said robert trojanowicz director of the 
school of criminal justice at michigan state university the turf 
wars over the drug business are generally whats causing the 
increase drugs are the major growth business these days 
not only are there more drug dealers trojanowicz said but the 
dealers are becoming more violent one reason is that american 
culture is becoming more violent another is that the supply of 
drugs has outstripped the demand so drug sellers are fighting for 
customers 
the bottom line from their standpoint is that they want to 
eliminate competition trojanowicz said the main method is to 
eliminate the competitor 
its not clear what happened to rosa nor is much known about his 
background neighbors told newspapers he was a drug dealer police 
have declined to comment on that but say the killing appears to 
have been drugrelated 
rosa lived on staten island not far from where the staten island 
ferry docks police found his body in the middle of a nearby 
intersection and pronounced him dead at the scene his head and 
upper torso were riddled with bullet wounds 
its pretty typical said sgt kenneth backes a detective 
assigned to staten island the least populated and most peaceful of 
new york citys five boroughs this is our 30th one for the year 
and we run the gamut here

city police are trying to find why two 
undercover officers left a hotel before they investigated a man 
suspected of drug involvement who was meeting at the time with mayor 
marion barry according to a published report 
barry has acknowledged meeting the man former city employee 
charles lewis three times last week at a hotel where a hotel maid 
complained that lewis offered her cocaine 
in an investigation that has since turned into a probe of how 
police handled a case touching on the mayor two undercover officers 
were reportedly called back from their attempt to buy drugs at the 
time barry was in the room with lewis according to the washington 
post 
the post also reported the city police official in charge of the 
original case offered to lie to reporters about the lewis 
investigation a charge the official denied 
that statement is emphatically a lie deputy chief edward j 
spurlock said on wusatv monday i would not lie in reference to 
the performance of my duty 
the washington post reported monday that barry was in a city 
hotel room with lewis on thursday when two detectives were called 
back from an attempt to make an undercover drug buy from lewis 
the post quoting unidentified city government sources said the 
detectives were on their way to the room but left after somebody 
called them back downstairs 
the post reported in todays editions that the two detectives 
gave conflicted accounts of the incident at the hotel but said no 
details were available on how the accounts differed

the cocaine had been in the room recently 
district of columbia police are now investigating whether lewis 
was involved with drugs how police handled the complaint and why 
the mayor was at the hotel

the nations first plant to turn plastic 
items like foam coffee cups and hamburger trays into things like 
flowerpots coat hangers and even fence posts opens next month 
and its creators expect the 4 million plant to change the 
reputation of the maligned material 
i predict that the plastic bashing thats going on today will 
stop and polystyrene will become an environmental hero said 
robert j barrett safety environmental officer at mobil chemical 
co of rochester ny one of two backers of the factory 
the plant called plastics again is a converted warehouse with 
machines that can turn 3 million pounds of dirty cups trays and 
cutlery the amount that 1000 schools throw away yearly into 
hard peasize pellets 
mobil and genpak corp of glens falls ny hope to use the 
pellets themselves and sell them to other companies for making wall 
insulation fence posts flowerpots and packing material or 
anything not dealing with food because of the danger of 
contamination they expect a profit by 1992 
barrett sees a lucrative market because the nation uses 5 billion 
pounds of polystyrene yearly he said mobil has five people 
searching for cheap sources of used or lowgrade plastic film for 
recycling 
one key to the plants survival however is teaching diners to 
stack their used cups and trays in a special garbage can so the 
waste can be collected easily and carted to the 21000squarefoot 
plant in this industrial town 40 miles west of boston 
to that end the company has spent three months carrying out 
lunchroom experiments at schools in lexington and glastonbury conn 
the company has agreed to take their polystyrene waste for free if 
the schools use the special garbage cans 
kids will be kids some are throwing plates in the wrong place 
as an act of rebellion said brad devlin glastonbury schools 
director of food services but im willing to bet a weeks pay 
that its been 90 percent effective 
the project has worked so well at one school in lexington that a 
principal at another complained about being left out of the 
experiment said james macinnes assistant superintendent 
the reason for its success the two said is that children are 
worried about diminishing landfill space for garbage including 
polystyrene which accounts for half the waste in school cafeterias 
macinnes said 300 teenagers signed petitions last spring 
demanding that lexington schools switch from polystyrene to paper 
although plastic is cheaper keeps food warm longer and doesnt get 
soggy 
the plant is the result of these and many other protests against 
the material that has become the rallying point of 
environmentalists supporters claim that polystyrene accounts for 
only 10 percent of all the plastics produced in the world takes up 
only onequarter of 1 percent of the nations landfill space and 
takes just as long as paper to biodegrade 
the polystyrene industry even volunteered to stop using 
chlorofluorocarbons in plastic manufacture by the end of 1988 
because it threatens the earths ozone layer 
nevertheless berkeley calif and suffolk county ny have 
banned polystyrene even gov michael dukakis in the state where 
the recycling plant is being built has banned state agencies from 
buying plasticfoam food packaging beginning in july 
the styrofoam industry has come to realize that if they want 
the public to buy the stuff theyve got to do something about 
throwing it away macinnes said 
genpak and mobil already had in their plants machinery to crumble 
pieces of polystyrene left over from making plastic trays and other 
products and to smooth them out into sheets ready for manufacturing 
again 
the challenge was inventing a way to wash the used plastic as it 
was being crumbled by the machines and to find a way to get the 
plastic ware from schools and other institutions to the plant 
researchers from the two companies came up with a string of 
machines that crumble wash dry and remove the air from the plastic 
particles and turn them into pellets 
massachusetts was chosen because of crinc a billericabased 
fleet of trucks started by the liquor industry a few years ago to 
pick up aluminum cans from around the state for recycling under the 
bottle bill 
plastics again plant manager tom tomazck said the 20 schools and 
two wang co cafeterias that will be the factorys main sources of 
polystyrene in its first year are on crinc truck routes 
in time he said the factory may branch out to prisons and other 
institutions and is talking to a fastfood chain he declined to name

members of a special police commando squad 
that quelled a prison uprising killed at least one inmate after he 
had surrendered according to a hostage rescued by the team 
at least five inmates may have been killed after surrendering 
freed hostage patricia castillo said monday that the commandos 
entered the venustiano carranza state penitentiary on friday 
shooting indiscriminately 
the squad was very angry because they the inmates had killed 
their commander i was very scared there was quite a bit of 
shooting they killed all the inmates there except one 
of the four inmates in the room where castillo spent 32 hours as 
a hostage only jose martinez palafox was captured alive she said 
martinez name is on the list of 25 people who died in the 
uprising in tepic 500 miles northwest of mexico city castillo said 
martinez had surrendered he was not wounded but they killed him 
anyway 
a clerk in the prison law office castillo was among about 19 
hostages seized thursday by a group of inmates to protest the denial 
of christmas pardons for good behavior 
officials at first said the inmates died during two assaults 
friday night but according to a witness two hostages and a 
videotape made by nbc news only one assault occurred and many 
mutinous prisoners were still alive afterward 
five of 13 inmates on the nbc videotape identified themselves to 
officers with names that appeared on the official list of prisoners 
who died in the assault those five did not include martinez palafox 
brenda margarita rubio a prison records clerk held hostage also 
said the inmates surrendered 
only one prisoner was in the room with her and about a dozen 
other hostages and that prisoner walked out with his hands raised 
she said 
castillo criticized the governor for calling in the special 
police squads 
on monday gov celso humberto delgado ramirez was quoted in a 
tepic newspaper as saying legal sanctions would be taken against 
those repsonsible for any unwarranted killings 
efforts to reach delgado who reportedly met with federal 
officials in mexico city on monday were unsuccessful 
rodolfo leon the state attorney general also promised to 
investigate the case carefully including reports inmates who were 
captured during the commando team assault were killed while in 
custody 
earlier monday state authorities had denied any knowledge of how 
five inmates died after they were videotaped while in police custody 
we are prepared to clear it all up leon told the associated 
press in a telephone interview right now it is very complicated 
nothing has been confirmed yet 
some prisoners bodies had up to 10 bullet wounds the government 
news agency notimex said 
among those who died before the assault were the prison warden 
samuel alvarado and jorge armando duarte badillo the fox squad 
commander who officials said was killed while trying to negotiate 
with the inmates 
one witness who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
prisoners captured after the assault were questioned in a park 
outside the prison then taken back inside members of the fox team 
also entered the prison and more than 30 gunshots were heard after 
that 
the death toll was given friday night as six but on saturday 
jumped to 22 then 24 a state government spokesman said monday that 
the confirmed toll was 25

the tokyo stock exchanges leading index rose to a 
record high today while the dollar edged up marginally against the 
japanese yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average a 18165point gainer on 
monday climbed another 18292 points or 061 percent closing this 
years last fullday session at 3005093 
it was the second time for the nikkei to close above 30000 it 
closed at 3005082 on dec 7 then fell back the next day on 
profittaking 
despite the rise in the index trading was directionless said a 
dealer with a major securities firm in tokyo 
investors just didnt know what to buy although they are 
expecting that prices would go up further he said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
interest floated from one issue to another in the absence of 
influence from overseas markets which were closed for the christmas 
holidays the dealer said 
in addition he said with the tokyo market due to close for a 
sixday new year holiday after a halfday session wednesday 
uncertainties over the ailing emperor hirohitos condition led to 
caution about large stock holdings 
a further market closing would be expected in case of the death 
of the 87yearold emperor now bedridden for 100 days with internal 
bleeding 
speculative investors were buying issues in spot trades and 
selling in the futures market to collect profits on the settlement 
which also helped the nikkeis rise other dealers said 
trading was not very active with volume traded on the first 
section estimated at 700 million shares 
on the foreign exchange market the dollar closed unchanged from 
the opening rate of 12480 yen up 008 yen from mondays close of 
12472 yen the currency moved in a narrow range between 12468 and 
12483 yen 
because overseas markets were closed for a monday most market 
participants stayed on the sidelines to await indications of how 
rates were moving said masaharu takenaka of the bank of tokyo 
the dollaryen rate was barely moving because investors cannot 
determine which direction they should move he said 
other dealers said most traders on the tokyo market appeared to 
have started yearend holidays already

the fight over the citys treatment of blacks 
will continue despite an agreement that stopped the trial of 13 
civil rights activists who tried to halt a city council meeting 
black leaders said 
several civil rights leaders said they now have some misgivings 
about last weeks agreement they said they may have given up a 
public forum that could have generated national attention about 
toledos racial problems and fear that the city will never 
negotiate in good faith 
i certainly regret having not held out that was a mistake 
said the rev floyd rose a defendant and a leader of a group of 
black ministers called the interdenominational ministerial alliance 
the 13 activists were arrested june 28 and charged with 
obstructing official business a judge dismissed the case wednesday 
after they pleaded no contest to a reduced charge of failure to 
disperse 
since then rose and other alliance members have met with city 
manager philip hawkey and mayor donna owens 
the city appears unwilling to negotiate on many of the issues 
that led to the arrests including giving severance pay to bernard 
culp the community development departments former commissioner of 
renewal operations rose said racial tensions flared after the city 
fired culp who is black and suspended two others the civil rights 
leaders asked for a hearing into allegations that he mishandled the 
citys housing programs but the request was denied 
the management shuffle in the department followed an 
investigation by the us department of housing and urban 
development that said the citys housing rehabilitation program was 
deficient the city was billed for home repairs that were never made 
they other defendants believed that by entering the 
nocontest plea to the lesser charge and agreeing to the conditions 
the city would at least make some concessions in kind of course 
the city has done nothing we just should not have done it rose 
said 
rose said the ministerial alliance will move ahead with calls for 
improvements to be made in black neighborhoods 
civil rights leaders said the city needs to become more sensitive 
to the needs of minorities and that more blacks must be hired and 
promoted in city government 
blacks comprise about 17 percent of toledos 340000 population 
and 22 percent of the city work force 
the city on dec 12 announced a new affirmative action plan 
which civil rights leaders called a step forward but the plan has 
not been adopted by city council 
still leroy williams president of the toledo chapter of the 
national association for the advancement of colored people said he 
is optimistic the city will be more attentive to their complaints 
in spite of what anybody says on both sides there have been 
some subtle negotiations or talks going on for the last couple of 
months i think that will probably have to be intensified he said 
he said the issues that led to the city council takeover will not 
fade 
at this point it would behoove the city to make geniune 
progress to avoid other acts of civil disobedience because they will 
become better organized williams said 
the mayor said the city wants to end the dispute but that she 
will not yield to threats of civil disobedience 
i have been in meetings with members of the black community we 
have been identifying issues that are of concern to them she 
said we want to continue to work together on those issues weve 
been doing this in a very good atmosphere 
i will not be in an atmosphere where its going to be 
combative i dont believe in dealing with issues by threats and i 
dont intend to be threatened

office equipment and was having breakfast at a hotel overlooking the

mixedfruit jam 
i had never tasted anything like that before he said 
recently recalling the trip to his native belize so i 
immediately called the chamber of commerce to find out who made it 
that inquiry led him to the melinda family who had been trying 
without success to break into the united states market 
that meeting led to the birth of reneau imports inc which is 
based in this chicago suburb and is betting its future that 
americans are willing to buy exotic jams 
these are fruits asians hispanics jamaicans grew up eating 
said reneau 30 the flavors will also appeal to others because 
people travel more and they expect something different 
reneaus melinda brand of banana mixed fruit tropical fruit 
guava papaya mango and pineapple jams and a carrotbased hot 
sauce also produced by the melinda family are scheduled to hit the 
shelves of two grocery chains in the midwest next month 
they are wild said martin mcdevitt jr a milwaukeebased

a cattle ranchers son has 
confessed to arranging last weeks murder of an ecologist and labor 
leader known worldwide for his efforts to preserve the amazon rain 
forest police say 
police said darcy pereira 21 told them he hired a professional 
killer to slay francisco mendes who was shot thursday as he stepped 
from his house in the jungle city of rio branco 2650 miles 
northwest of rio de janeiro 
the local police official who was reached by telephone and 
provided the associated press with the information identified 
himself only as officer calbi and would not offer further details 
tv globo the nations principal private network said pereiras 
father was involved in a land dispute with mendes 44 who was known 
internationally for leading a campaign against destruction of the 
amazon region 
in june 1987 mendes was honored by the united nations for his 
fight as head of the local rubber tappers union to stop acres of 
rain forest from being cleared for cattle grazing 
pereira turned himself in to the 4th police precinct in rio 
branco accompanied by a lawyer according to tv globo it identified 
pereira as the son of cattle rancher darli alves da silva who tv 
globo reported was involved in a land dispute with mendes 
under brazilian custom the son does not always use his fathers 
name 
mendes said in recent news interviews that he received death 
threats from alves da silva police had assigned two guards to 
protect mendes 
land disputes have killed about 250 people a year in brazil since 
1985 landless peasant farmers ecologists and progressives in the 
roman catholic church have suffered most in battles with large land 
owners many of whom employ private armies to protect their 
properties

for the first time in 15 years of 
authoritarian rule president augusto pinochets government has 
agreed to hold formal talks with opposition leaders 
the government agreed monday to meet the opposition on jan 3 to 
discuss demands for constitutional changes that would speed up a 
transition to democracy 
patricio aylwin president of the centrist christian democratic 
party and spokesman for a 17party opposition coalition requested 
the meeting 
the opposition stepped up demands for constitutional changes 
after its stunning victory oct 5 in a referendum in which gen 
pinochet sought to extend his hold on power until 1997 
the 73yearold president and army commander has ruled since a 
bloody 1973 military coup ousted elected president salvador allende 
a marxist 
interior minister carlos caceres vetoed participation in the 
january meeting by luis maira whose newly founded wide front of the 
socialist left party includes members of the outlawed communist 
party 
the opposition did not immediately say if it would accept the 
veto but it will probably go ahead with the meeting without 
maira sources said 
pinochets loss in the oct 5 referendum forced him to call open 
elections for president and congress now scheduled for dec 14 
1989 
government foes say constitutional changes are needed before the 
election so the next government can effectively lead chile to 
democracy 
the opposition wants to reduce the quorum required to amend the 
constitution to drop an article outlawing marxist parties and to 
change the makeup of a powerful national security council now 
dominated by the military 
dissidents also want to eliminate an article that makes onethird 
of the future 35member senate appointed instead of elected 
the government initially balked at constitutional changes but 
highranking officials recently have conceded the possibility of 
improving the militaryinspired constitution 
caceres a civilian said that in agreeing to meet the 
opposition the government is prepared to listen and debate 
different points of view that are expressed respectfully and within 
the legal framework 
caceres was appointed interior minister in a cabinet shuffle 
ordered by pinochet after his referendum defeat

alive but not quite kicking legs diamond 
finally opened monday on broadway and the results are a mixed bag 
of musical tricks 
the much anticipated and already much maligned peter allen 
musical is not the disaster some had feared but the show which 
premiered at the mark hellinger theater after nearly two months of 
preview performances is not exactly memorable either 
one trouble with legs is its star peter allen who also 
wrote the music and lyrics for this 5 million extravaganza about 
the famous new york gangster allen is a galvanizing performer an 
ok dancer and a croaky but appealing singer but hes not an actor 
and you need someone with a sense of character to inject life and 
more important believability into the spineless book by harvey 
fierstein and charles suppon 
thats another of the shows missteps the skimpiest story this 
side of starlight express fierstein and suppon reportedly have 
pared the book to a fraction of what it once was they must have 
taken out all the jokes because the laughs are pretty meager 
thats a deadly prospect for a show which insistently trumpets 
itself as a big new broadway musical 
entertain is what legs diamond most desperately wants to do 
sometimes it actually does 
from the moment the curtain rises you know you are looking at a 
frivolous and expensive show theres allen strutting on a catwalk 
high above the stage singing about when i get my name in lights 
while what looks like every light bulb in times square flash the 
shows subtitle the almost totally fictitious musical hystery of 
legs diamond 
the number pretty much tells the story of the show this mobster 
is not a killer but a songanddance man and hed rather star in 
his own nightclub act than take over the citys bootleg operations 
he eventually succeeds but his climb to show biz success seems 
predictable from the start 
still legs diamond does a lot to camouflage this lack of 
suspense for one thing it never stops moving its almost as if 
director robert allan ackerman and choreographer alan johnson were 
afraid to have the musical slow down if it did it might not be 
able to start up again 
johnson has devised several frantic lavish and timekilling 
dances for a line of chorus cuties the numbers recall the carol 
burnett show on an offnight 
still the dances give costume designer willa kim a chance to go 
wild somehow she manages to put the girls in reindeer antlers and 
even kewpie doll hats for the shows more than 300 costumes kim 
seems to have cornered the market on all the sequins feathers 
spangles and even bananas in new york 
set designer david mitchell also makes sure the momentum never 
flags his gargantuan settings include two different and lavish 
nightclubs pennsylvania station a long prison cell block and a 
boulevard of skyscrapers that hug the top of the hellingers ornate 
ceiling 
allens score particularly the ballads exerts a lot of charm 
it successfully bridges pop and musical comedy something rare among 
the current crop of broadways musicals several of the songs would 
seem to be able to have a life outside the show particularly 
allens finale all i wanted was the dream the show should make 
a fine original cast recording 
the story also includes several unconvincing love affairs for 
diamond his love life includes an archetypal dumb blonde named 
kiki played in fine squeakyvoiced style by randall edwards and 
flo a toughtalking older woman played by the terrific julie 
wilson 
miss wilson a musical comedy veteran wrings some honest emotion 
from a torch song called the music went out of my life the 
closest thing the musical has to a showstopper 
there is one stunning production number called only steal from 
thieves in which diamond muscles in on the territory of his chief 
rival arnold rothstein played by joe silver in it the battle 
between the gangs is waged behind a giant scrim and the hijacking of 
a train ship and truck is seen in silhouette 
the other male performers have a hard time of it in legs 
diamond and are given little opportunity to shine the gangsters 
in such musicals as guys and dolls and do re mi were funny 
brash even rakish characters here they are nearly anonymous 
buffoons despite the game try by such excellent character actors as 
silver raymond serra christian kauffmann and jim fyfe 
still the success of this show rests on the success of the 
performer who plays its title character not the supporting players 
and peter allen doesnt quite deliver 
legs diamond is a musical in search of a leading man 
in other reviews 
the creators of legs diamond could not even come up with the 
riotous largerthanlife fiasco of which theatrical legends are 
made wrote frank rich in the new york times the script so 
confusing i lost its thread before the end of the first number is a 
series of song cues that never crystallizes into a story as for 
mr allens songs they are so derivative they make andrew lloyd 
webbers scores sound idiosyncratic 
howard kissel wrote in the daily news allens score seldom 
goes beyond the pleasant though it has been attractively 
orchestrated and there are several engaging choral numbers his 
talent is supperclub size likeable soft intimate neither as a 
songwriter nor as a performer can he fill a broadway stage as a 
gangster even a singing and dancing gangster he is hopeless 
most of the music appears to take unmemorability to the point 
of clinical amnesia and you go out humming a headache wrote 
clive barnes in the new york post the lyrics have little 
originality or fancy while the book seems to take the sobriquet 
legs so literally that the shows narrative becomes a pedestrian 
walkway

prime minister noboru takeshita today formed a new 
cabinet and established a party committee on ethics in an effort to 
restore public confidence in a government embarrassed by a 
stocktrading scandal 
he is determined to restore public confidence by aggressively 
dealing with the matter of political ethics chief cabinet 
secretary keizo obuchi said in a nationally televised news 
conference 
but one political analyst said the new cabinet must face the 
problem that takeshita himself was linked to the scandal 
the 20member cabinet contains 15 new names but key officials 
such as obuchi foreign minister sousuke uno and finance minister 
tatsuo murayama retained their posts 
takeshitas popularity has been eroded by the passage of a 
controversial tax reform program and by the scandal in which 
influential politicians profited from transactions in unlisted 
shares in a real estate firm 
earlier this month a poll in the newspaper mainichi shimbun 
showed the takeshita governments approval rating had slumped to 18 
percent from 30 percent when he took office in november 1987 
takeshita had an aide who profited in share transactions but the 
prime minister denied any personal involvement 
i am aware that the public is losing confidence in politicians 
business leaders and public officials said new justice minister 
takashi hasegawa who heads a parliamentary ethics committee and was 
expected to lead governmental corruption investigations 
it is a serious matter to rectify it for japan to be trusted 
in the international arena we have to start with establishing a 
trustworthy political system 
political analyst masaya ito said the reshuffle is to eliminate 
the shadow of the scandal from the government and to make a fresh 
start 
he noted that none of the politicians implicated in the scandal 
was included in takeshitas new cabinet but the real problem 
which the new cabinet will inevitably face is the fact that 
takeshita himself was linked to the scandal 
apart from the new justice ministry appointment analysts said 
the reshuffle was routine and they expected no significant changes 
in government policies 
prime ministers customarily rotate senior members of the liberal 
democratic party through ministerial posts without changing the 
power balance among major factions in the party the liberal 
democrats have run japan for 33 years but for a brief period in 
194748 when the leftist social democratic party was in power they 
and their conservative predecessors have governed since the end of 
world war ii 
murayama has held his post since saturday his predecessor 
kiichi miyazawa resigned on dec 9 taking responsibility for his 
link to the scandal 
opposition demands for a complete probe into the scandal slowed 
parliamentary debate on tax reform and led to the resignation of 17 
influential politicians and business leaders including miyazawa and 
hisashi shinto chairman of nippon telegraph and telephone co a 
telecommunications giant 
the liberal democrats however parried the opposition skillfully 
and pushed the tax reform package through parliament by using a 
commanding majority in both houses 
the first sweeping overhaul of the countrys postwar tax system 
had been a pending issue for the governing party for more than a 
decade but successive adminstrations were stymied by a lack of 
public support and opposition criticism

the state legislature should establish the 
nations first american indianrun urban school district to focus on 
the special educational needs of native american children a group 
of educators recommends 
the 15member indian school council created by the legislature 
last february recently submitted a preliminary report recommending 
that the special district open a school in the twin cities by the 
fall of 1990 
minnesotas indian children who have had some of the public 
school systems lowest test scores and highest dropout rates would 
not be required to attend the school but the council said it 
believes the twin cities indian community would overwhelmingly 
support such a school which they anticipate would be threequarters 
indian 
supporters of the plan say they hope an indianrun school that 
puts the needs of indians first will instill selfconfidence and 
pride in students about their indian heritage and reduce the stream 
of dropouts from public schools 
the supporters also say an indiancontrolled school would 
encourage support from indian parents who traditionally have seen 
education as a tool of white society to separate them from their 
indian identity 
the idea is to make what is public about public education 
closer to the constituents students said david beaulieu 
director of indian education for the state department of education 
and a member of the indian school council you can change the 
child to fit the school or you can change the school to fit the 
child 
its real clear that public education is not working well for a 
lot of american indians he said so im in favor of anything 
that i can be convinced will increase student achievement 
the legislature opened the door for the creation of an urban 
indianrun school district when it created the indian school council 
during the past session 
but the report arrives at a time when metropolitan school 
districts are wrestling with the question of how to desegregate and 
the idea of a predominantly indian school flies in the face of that 
ideal 
indianrun reservation schools are commonplace but an indianrun 
public school in an urban setting would be unique and involve 
meshing the tenets of mainstream education with traditional indian 
ideas such as the study of tribal law and culture 
such a school would place indian concerns first because the 
majority of students in this case would be composed of indians said 
don allery chairman of the indian school council and tribal 
historian for the red lake indian reservation 
who controls the system is who dictates the priorities 
allery said last week 
but the indian school council was not unanimous in its 
recommendation of the school proposal 
st paul school board member eleanor weber who sat on the 
council as a representative of her school board says the 
legislature should consider alternatives such as creating an indian 
magnet school in an existing school district recruiting more indian 
teachers and beefing up funding for existing indian education 
programs 
the viewpoint i have heard is that there is something 
inherently beneficial about the education of indians by indians 
she said now i have yet to see the evidence 
the reports authors say they envision a school that includes 
grades k12 located in the metropolitan area no site or even 
preferred city was named in the report 
minneapolis has the metro areas largest concentration of indian 
students slightly less than 3000 or about 75 percent of its 
39500 total student population st paul has about 900 indian 
students or 3 percent of its 33000 student body 
the report does not set the schools size but estimates by 
supporters have ranged from 500 to 3000 students

a briton imprisoned in iran for more than two years 
on weapons charges returned home today after being released from a 
tehran prison 
nicholas nicola 23 was met by his father and by foreign office 
officials at londons heathrow airport following his arrival on an 
iran air flight 
he smiled as he walked down the airplanes steps and was then 
driven directly out of the airport from the aircraft without 
commenting on his ordeal the foreign office would not disclose his 
whereabouts 
news of nicolas release first came from the englishlanguage 
newspaper tehran times which reported today that he had been turned 
over to british charge daffaires gordon pirie on monday 
the newspaper report was carried by the official islamic republic 
news agency and later confirmed by the british foreign office 
britain said nicola a tourist traveling by land from pakistan 
when arrested had been held without trial since september 1986 but 
the irna report said he had been officially charged tried and 
sentenced to 3 years in prison for the possession of two weapons 
and a number of cartridges 
it said nicola was freed because of good behavior in prison 
in london a foreign office spokesman called the release an 
important step forward 
the iranians up until now have been in breach of the vienna 
convention in refusing to give adequate consular access to detained 
britains said the spokesman speaking anonymously in keeping with 
british custom 
britain and iran agreed dec 9 to restore diplomatic ties ending 
a 19month strain that began when an iranian envoy was arrested in 
manchester northern england on shoplifting charges in may 1987 
earlier this year a british diplomat david reddaway was 
allowed to visit nicola and another briton roger cooper at 
tehrans maximum security evin prison he reported both men were 
physically fit 
cooper 52 a businessman who has lived in iran for more than 20 
years was originally detained in november 1985 for overstaying his 
visa he later was charged with spying 
nicolas release raised hopes that cooper may soon be freed the 
gradual easing for strain between the two countries may also signal 
new hope for british hostages believed held in lebanon 
britain seeks the release of three of its nationals held by 
proiranian islamic fundamentalists anglican envoy terry waite 
journalist john mccarthy and teacher brian keenan a belfast man 
with dual british and irish nationality whose release is also sought 
by the irish government 
the foreign office says it also seeks word on alec collett a new 
yorkbased british journalist whose palestinian abductors claim they 
killed him his body was never found 
they are among 15 foreigners including nine americans missing 
and believed held in lebanon the longest held is terry anderson 
chief middle east correspondent of the associated press he was 
abducted march 16 1985

thousands of chinese youths chanting kill the black ghosts 
on monday surrounded the central chinese citys train station as the 
students tried to depart for the capital by train american 
witnesses said 
but police would not let the africans embark one american 
student said 
chinese students at a university in nanking did not attend 
classes today and officials at another school urged students not to 
participate in further demonstrations american students said 
several truckloads of police patrolled the city the americans 
said 
the clashes and demonstrations which began saturday and lasted 
until monday night are the latest in a series of incidents between 
chinese and chinas 1500 african students two years ago the 
government crushed widespread student demonstrations seeking greater 
democracy 
china prides itself on its good ties with african countries 
relations between the africans and chinese however have often been 
strained chinese often are openly racist saying they find black 
people dirty 
the problem is compounded because african students in china are 
mostly single men who spend up to six years here and want to date 
chinese women 
chinese teachers and students think this is improper 
especially with african men said a us diplomat 
the six americans held at the hotel all of whom are white went 
to the train station with the africans to express solidarity with 
them the us diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the protests did not have an antiamerican character 
he said after talking to the students that they were being 
treated well but wanted to return to their universities the 
average student feels he is being held against his will he said 
the american students included five women and one man and are 
from us universities such as duke university in north carolina and 
wesleyan university in connecticut their names were not released 
huang jie an official at the jiangsu province foreign affairs 
office said most of the students had returned to their schools but 
the us diplomat and officials at several schools in nanking said 
this was not true 
the us official also said that ambassadors from three african 
countries met with the african students today to talk about their 
safety concerns 
the incident in nanking began when african students at hehai 
university wanted to bring two chinese women to a party but refused 
a guards request for the womens identification 
in a brawl that followed 11 chinese and two africans were 
injured the official xinhua news agency reported 
later sunday hehais 70 african students fled the school for the 
nanking train station where they were joined by africans from other 
schools along with the six americans 
on sunday night chinese police stopped them from taking a train 
to beijing 
monday afternoon a crowd of about 5000 chinese marched to the 
train station and 2000 succeeded in getting around a police 
barricade american witnesses said 
the africans only left the train station after chinese officials 
told them they would let the chinese students inside if they didnt 
leave 
joe profaizer an english teacher at nanking university said the 
chinese students who participated in the march monday said they were 
doing so because they didnt believe the government was interested 
in upholding the law 
however other americans said they believed the fundamental 
nature of the protests remained antiblack 
profaizer said chinese students at nanking university told him 
they had been told not to demonstrate chinese students also told 
him that students at hehai university had not attended classes 
today he said 
africans and chinese have had a series of clashes over the last 
few years 
in 1986 a fight broke out between african and chinese students in 
the northeastern port city of tianjin and 18 africans fled to 
safety in beijing about 200 african students in the capital staged 
a march through beijing streets complaining of racial discrimination 
against blacks 
in 1980 19 africans and arabs and 24 chinese were injured in a 
fight in shanghai that began over loud music from a foreigners

the plos executive committee today 
rejected a reported israeli plan to grant limited autonomy to 
palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip and allow them 
to elect their own representatives 
the 15member ruling body of the palestine liberation 
organization called the idea a new maneuver aimed at diverting 
world attention away from palestinian peace overtures 
on monday the israeli daily maariv said prime minister yitzhak 
shamir planned to propose an egyptian role in getting negotiations 
started between israel and a joint delegation of palestinians and 
representatives from jordan 
the aim of such talks would be to reach an interim agreement for 
palestinian selfrule in the west bank and gaza the newspaper said 
the plo comments came in a statement issued today a day after 
the executive committee ended a threeday meeting in baghdad iraq 
text of the statement was made available to news agencies in nicosia 
the plo statement said that palestinians will not endorse any 
settlement that falls short of the establishment of an independent 
state to coexist with israel 
it cautioned world public opinion against falling for the 
latest israeli trick and stressed israel must withdraw from 
the occupied territories which must be placed under united nations 
supervision for an interim transitional period 
as for the latest election farce the palestinians have already 
chosen their representatives the palestine liberation 
organization the sole legitimate representative of the 
palestinians 
the plo has repeatedly rejected the idea of limited autonomy for 
palestinians in the west bank and gaza occupied by israel since the 
1967 middle east war 
the plo statement today saluted the 90 countries it said have 
recognized the independent palestinian state proclaimed nov 15 by 
the palestine national council the groups parliamentinexile 
palestinian sources said the committee members agreed to seek to 
upgrade plo offices in countries that have recognized the 
stillsymbolic state from information centers to embassies 
the committees sessions were devoted mainly to the usplo 
dialogue which began earlier this month when washington reversed a 
13year ban on contacts with the organization 
washington reversed the ban after plo chief yasser arafat said 
the plo recognized israel and renounced terrorism

the first of the dead have been 
identified from pan am flight 103 and investigators today began 
tests on a suitcase for clues as to whether a bomb or structural 
failure caused britains worst air disaster 
police said they hoped to release five or six bodies to next of 
kin today once the last formality of registering the death in 
lockerbie was completed names and nationalities were not issued 
one more victim was found monday bringing the total in two 
temporary morgues in the city hall and an ice rink to 240 
pan am said today it had determined that another infant was on 
board flight 103 bringing the total of passengers and crew on the 
plane to 259 eleven townspeople are still listed as missing and 
feared dead 
after three days of constant rain more than 600 rescue workers 
resumed their search under clear skies today for the remaining 
victims and for missing wreckage including sections of the 
airplanes wings 
police divers joined the rescue effort searching the icy 
rainswollen waters of the lakes reservoirs and bogs in the 100 
square miles of rugged terrain and dense woods surrounding the crash 
zone 
civilian and royal air force pathologists and a group of 
orthodontists examined bodies in temporary morgues in the town hall 
and ice rink but expected the identification process would take 
another 10 days 
police spokesman angus kennedy said today three more men had been 
arrested after being found in possession of parts of the aircraft 
the men ages 20 21 and 40 will appear in court on wednesday 
along with a 28yearold man who was arrested monday for looting at 
the crash 
i am disgusted with certain things i have seen at the very 
thought that something like this could happen in the midst of all 
this when everyone else is trying to help said paul newall the 
areas chief deputy constable 
a suspect suitcase and an unspecified amount of wreckage were 
sent monday to the royal armament research and development 
establishment in southern england for more detailed examination to 
determine whether they exhibit evidence of a preimpact explosion 
michael charles the top british investigator on the scene said in 
a statement 
transport department press officer penny russellsmith said the 
tests began today and might be concluded as early as tonight or 
perhaps a few days 
the times of london reported that the suitcase noticed lying 
among wreckage was ripped and torn and might have been damaged by 
flying metal the report said the fort halstead scientists should 
quickly be able to establish whether those marks were made by an 
exploding bomb 
charles statement added that although no evidence of structural 
failure had turned up that was still being probed as a possible 
cause 
structural failure or a bomb have been identified by experts as 
the most likely reasons why the pan am plane disappeared from radar 
screens just as it reached cruising altitude of 31000 feet over 
southwest scotland on dec 21 
the daily mail newspaper said without attribution 
circumstantial evidence points to a bomb being planted in a 
suitcase loaded into the forward baggage compartment beneath the 
flight deck and the first class cabin this part of the aircraft was 
ripped away from the main structure of the fuselage 
the new yorkbound flight originated as a boeing 727 from 
frankfurt west germany with a change of planes at londons 
heathrow airport federal police in west germany and the commander 
of scotland yards antiterrorist squad last week began 
investigations at those airports 
monday was boxing day in the long british christmas celebration 
and a day of more public grief at the roman catholic church in 
lockerbie where the rev patrick keegans celebrated a requiem mass 
confronted with the horror of such loss we feel empty hurt 
confused and we say to ourselves things will never be the same 
again keegans said in a brief homily 
as christ did on the cross we too scream at the father my 
god my god why have you abandoned me he does not seem to answer 
there is only silence 
keegans who has been counseling both parishioners and relatives 
arriving from other countries lost his home in the crash

three democratic contenders facing cook county 
states attorney richard m daley in next years mayoral primary 
want an investigation into charges that daley staff members 
submitted illegal referendum petitions 
mayor eugene sawyer and aldermen tim evans and larry bloom issued 
the calls in separate appearances monday after the chicago tribune 
reported sunday it had found strong evidence that the petition 
gathering by employees of daley and other democratic party regulars 
had violated election laws 
at least nine employees of daleys office or their family members 
circulated petitions and gathered dozens of handwritten names of 
people who said they never signed the petitions the newspaper said 
the petition drive in 1985 and 1986 was to put on the ballot a 
measure that would prevent a candidate from winning a party primary 
without a majority of the vote by instituting a nonpartisan general 
election 
daley ran unsuccessfully against the late harold washington in 
the 1983 democratic primary when he split the white vote with mayor 
jane byrne washington went on to win the general election to become 
the citys first black mayor 
an investigation was launched two years ago when allies of 
washington charged the petition drive was fraught with abuse but 
the states attorneys office has not brought any charges the 
threeyear statute of limitations is about to end 
we should get a special prosecutor and get it done said 
sawyer who is running to retain his job i think we ought to 
aggressively pursue this forgery is forgery 
daleys spokeswoman avis lavelle suggested the calls for a 
special prosecutor were politically motivated noting that daley had 
removed himself from his offices investigation of possible fraud 
and forgery during the 198586 drive

contra rebels say they have 
released on the nicaraguan border 104 captives they had held for 
at least a year in honduras 
in a separate development monday an umbrella organization for 
contra and internal opposition groups said it had requested a 
meeting with president daniel ortega of nicaragua next week so it 
can offer a peace proposal 
in honduras a spokesman for the rebels said all prisoners were 
turned over to red cross roman catholic church and human rights 
representatives near the border towns of trojes and capire 
the rebel spokesman identified as commander johnson said the 
prisoners released friday included more than 70 former soldiers of 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
he said they had been captured in battles more than a year ago 
the red cross and the honduran foreign ministry refused to 
confirm that former sandinista soldiers had been released 
honduran authorities prevented journalists from going to the 
towns about 250 miles east of tegucigalpa 
johnson said all prisoners were in good physical condition 
at a news conference dec 20 foreign minister carlos lopez 
contreras of honduras said the nicaraguan resistance the contras 
political arm was holding at least 104 captives in honduras 
the government has knowledge that there are more and will 
continue efforts to free all of all of them he said 
he also said that president jose azcona hoyo had asked the red 
cross the church and the interinstitutional human rights 
commission to initiate efforts to rescue the nicaraguan captives 
the usbacked rebels have been fighting the sandinistas since 
1981 and the conflict has by government count claimed at least 
26500 lives the two sides agreed to a truce in march but further 
negotiations have deadlocked 
the request to meet ortega jan 4 and deliver a peace proposal to 
him was made by the democratic center coalition which was created 
in october within the nicaraguan resistance 
in a telephone interview a coalition spokesman octaviano cesar 
said the group had sent two letters to nicaraguan officials since 
dec 19 but the government had not answered 
the peace proposal calls for the formation of a reconstruction 
commission made up of business labor and government leaders 
cesar said the coalition will present the peace proposal to the 
other central american countries so it might be discussed at a 
meeting of the regions foreign ministers in managua on jan 1213 
and at the regional presidential summit two days later 
the democratic center coalition is considered to offer itself as 
an alternative to rightwing forces in the nicaraguan resistance

egypt wants israel to agree to talk to the 
palestine liberation organization before president hosni mubarak 
will visit the jewish state a cabinet minister said today 
butros ghali minister of state for foreign affairs and egypts 
secondranking diplomat set the condition today in a statement to 
reporters 
egypt always has emphasized the importance of dialogue and 
contact between the plo and israel ghali said 
in light of this objective president hosni mubarak is prepared 
to visit israel if it agrees to dialogue with the plo he said 
such a condition would virtually rule out a visit by mubarak to 
israel which views the plo as a terrorist group and refuses to deal 
with it rejection of any dialogue with the plo is part of the 
coalition agreement signed last week by israels likud bloc and 
labor party 
mubarak made a qualified offer to visit israel in interviews with 
the kuwaiti newspaper alanbaa and the japanese newspaper yomiuri in 
the last few days 
why not go he said when alanbaa asked if he would visit 
israel to solve the palestinian issue if this visit would lead to 
solving the problem and if it would lead to establishing a just 
peace then i am ready 
mubarak told yomiuri he had no firm intention to visit israel but 
again offered to go if necessary to achieve peace but it 
depends he added i dont accept any preconditions 
mubaraks remarks were immediately welcomed in israel and the 
united states prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel however 
said the egyptians must attach no preconditions to the visit 
ghali was among the architects of the 1979 israeliegyptian peace 
teaty the only one between an arab county and the jewish state he 
has held his ministerial post since president anwar sadat visited 
israel in 1977 to launch a peace initiative 
ghalis statement today was supported by other government 
sources who said a mubarak visit to israel was almost 
unimaginable unless shamir changed his opposition to an 
international peace the conference and accepted the plo as a 
negotiating partner 
the sources said there have been no meetings in cairo between any 
israeli embassy diplomat and any foreign ministry official on a 
mubarak visit contrary to statements made monday by shamirs 
spokesmen avi pazner 
in jerusalem israeli officials appeared today to be playing down 
the probability of a mubarak visit 
maybe the mubarak statement was given much more importance 
than mubarak meant an israeli foreign ministry official said he 
spoke on condition of anonymity

it may be better to resist an attacker than 
submit to a sexual assault according to a new study from the 
university of california los angeles 
the study published in the january issue of the american journal 
of public health suggests resistance is most effective when the 
assailant is making verbal threats but probably is futile in 
response to physical violence 
the bottom line is resistance does little to increase ones 
chances of injury said judith siegel associate professor at the 
ucla school of public health and the studys main investigator 
victims who fought back in the majority of cases did so after 
they were harmed which suggests the resistance itself was not 
provocation ms siegel concluded 
when the assailant is using verbal pressure it looks in a 
number of cases like the victim can talk their way out of it ms 
siegel said 
the new study contradicts earlier research concluding that 
resistance goads the attacker into further violence 
sociologists have debated for years whether resistance is more 
likely to save a victims life or provoke a more violent attack but 
no consensus has been reached 
ms siegels researchers surveyed 3132 men and women nationwide 
of those surveyed 365 had been sexually assaulted or were victims 
of an attempted assault 
five percent of the victims were younger than 16 years old 
more than onethird said they responded by talking or reasoning 
telling their assailants you wont go to heaven im not 
interested in you or ill tell your wife ms siegel said 
about onefourth of those surveyed didnt resist and slightly 
less than a quarter fought back physically four percent responded 
with loud and angry talking and 8 percent told the attacker they had 
no sexual interest in him 
the study showed that children were the least likely to fight 
back 
children may be more trusting of others and less able to 
distinguish at onset an act of affection from an attempt at sexual 
contact the study said further children are socialized to be 
deferent and obedient particularly to those in positions of 
authority or power

israels central bank today announced a 5 
percent devaluation of the shekel in hopes of stemming a wave of 
panic buying of us dollars and other foreign currencies 
rumors over the last few weeks that the shekel would be devalued 
by as much as 15 percent provoked many israelis to buy foreign 
currency hoping to sell later at a better rate 
the tel aviv stock exchange halted trading early today to give 
the markets time to adjust to the announcement israel army radio 
said 
bank of israel spokesman gideon schurr said the devaluation meant 
the us dollar would now buy 168 shekels compared with 1599 at 
the previous rate fixed by the government the bank of israel is the 
nations central bank 
schurr said the banks move was in response to renewed 
purchases of foreign currency by the public in recent days which 
were particularly high today 
he declined to give figures but israel radio said israelis have 
been buying as much as 70 million in foreign currency 
a devaluation had not been anticipated until after the first of 
the year economists said further devaluations still were likely in 
part to stimulate flagging exports 
industries have been calling for a devaluation to ease a squeeze 
on profits caused by rising production costs and static income from 
sales abroad the last devaluation was 10 percent against the dollar 
in january 1987 
shimon peres finance minister in the new government formed last 
week has said devaluation would not help the economy unless 
government spending also was cut

a manufacturer of agent orange and other 
dioxintainted herbicides knew of dangers to its workers for 12 
years but rejected safety modifications because they could have 
hurt productivity documents show 
the diamond alkali co whose plant here produced the herbicides 
between 1951 and 1969 received a series of memos in 1957 from ch 
boehringer sohn a west german chemical manufacturer warning of the 
dangers of a nameless byproduct of the manufacture of certain 
herbicides 
the byproduct eventually became known as dioxin and has been 
linked to skin diseases liver damage birth defects and some forms 
of cancer 
the memos were among confidential company documents provided to 
the associated press by an attorney who acted on condition of 
anonymity involved in litigation over the herbicides 
company officials referred questions to attorney george mccarter 
of newark who said in a telephone interview that he and the company 
could not comment because of a pending lawsuit 
in 1967 diamond alkali merged with the texasbased shamrock oil 
and gas co to form the diamond shamrock corp which has its 
headquarters in dallas the new jersey plant was closed in 1969 
boehringer sent the memos to its competitors around the world 
after the west german company learned the hard way a 1953 explosion 
at its hamburg plant exposed 37 workers to the herbicide 245t 
and many of them developed a severe skin condition known as 
chloracne and eventually suffered liver damage 
the west german company worried about the longterm effects of 
the contamination tore the plant down and redesigned its production 
process to virtually eliminate dioxin it offered to help its 
competitors including diamond alkali to do the same 
after a 1960 explosion at its plant diamond alkali rebuilt it 
with little change in design despite plant manager john burtons 
recommendation that some of boehringers methods be adopted the 
memos show 
david j porter a diamond alkali researcher who acted as a 
liaison with the west germans seemed to be impressed with the west 
germans methods according to an internal company memo dated sept 
18 1957 
in view of our problems with chloracne problems in our plant 
it would certainly seem in order to check these observations if 
possible in trial plant runs porter wrote 
but in papers filed with essex county judge leo yanoff who is 
hearing the lawsuit against diamond shamrock company researcher 
tw fraser russell questioned the feasibility of the west germans 
ideas 
those suggestions specifically concerning temperature and 
dilution would have resulted in a far less productive and 
significantly less economic operation of the plant he said 
the documents are expected to figure in a lawsuit pending in 
essex county superior court on behalf of 21 former workers at 
diamond alkalis plant their relatives and some longtime residents 
of newarks ironbound neighborhood the site of the plant 
the lawsuit charges that the company fradulently withheld 
information about the dangers of dioxin from the employees and the 
government 
state environmental officials in 1983 called the neighborhood one 
of the worst dioxin contamination sites in the nation and ordered a 
16 million cleanup 
it is clear that contrary to current beliefs diamond shamrock 
knew in the late 1950s that its process for producing herbicides 
exposed workers to great risk and could have been altered said 
plaintiffs attorney michael gordon

presidentelect bush remained secluded 
today at an isolated ranch but he and his friends were not 
optimistic about their quail hunting prospects because of poor 
weather conditions his spokesman said 
steve hart said bush armed with a shotgun managed to kill some 
birds on the first day of his vacation at the lazy f ranch on 
monday he didnt strike out hart said 
but today bush was not optimistic about bagging any quail because 
of the gusting winds and overcast skies that threatened rain he 
said 
nonetheless hart said the party set out on their morning hunt 
bush an avid outdoorsman who says he loves shooting birds 
planned no public appearances while at the 10000acre ranch about 
70 miles north of corpus christi and 15 miles from this rural town 
of 15000 people 
hart said bush viewed his time at the ranch owned by houston 
millionaire will farish as a chance to relax away from the daily 
pressures of the nations capital 
joining bush on the hunting trip an annual event for the last 20 
years were bushs brother jonathan james a baker iii the 
designated secretary of state and farish also staying at the 
simple onestory ranch house were farishs wife sarah and bakers 
wife susan 
the bushes bakers and farishes have a bond that goes back to the 
days when they all lived in houston where bush was in the oil 
business 
mrs bush remained in washington to pack up the vice presidents 
house in preparation for the move to the white house next month 
bushs schedule for the next two days will involve rising early 
to stalk quail and then returning for lunch hart said bush 
probably will take a nap in the afternoon do a bit more hunting and 
then retire early probably about 8 pm 
though bush described himself as a fairly good shot 
quailhunting conditions were less than ideal on monday the day he 
flew into chase naval air station 
locals said the 70degree temperature was too warm and the bird 
population was devastated by the summer drought 
bush said he was not squeamish about shooting birds even though 
he doubted he would kill deer discussing birds he said our 
forefathers ate by harvesting game 
work was not a high priority during the holiday even though bush 
said he brought along a little homework a little inaugural 
background material a little reading primarily on the budget 
before he was driven to the hideaway in the scrub brush bush 
wearing his pants tucked into his cowboy boots told reporters that 
he had talked by telephone to his son jeb bush who was flying back 
from a quick visit to soviet armenia scene of a devastating 
earthquake 
jeb a miami real estate developer and his son george 12 flew 
into armenia on christmas day to deliver toys and medical supplies 
to children 
bush said his son told him the trip was probably the most 
moving thing he has ever been involved in 
on another matter the presidentelect also said he supported 
egyptian president hosni mubaraks overtures to meet israeli leaders 
in israel 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir also welcomed a mubarak 
visit as a way of moving towards peace in the middle east 
the more contact they have the better it is bush said 
asked if he would visit the middle east to encourage peace bush 
replied if i thought it would further the peace process i would 
get on that plane right now and go 
but he quickly added he is not the president yet and such 
diplomatic events require planning and policy reviews 
bush who has named his cabinet secretaries except for energy 
said he would have no announcement until friday at the earliest he 
also is looking for a drug czar 
on thursday bush flies to pintlalla ala for a few hours of 
bass fishing with ray scott a friend who founded bass masters he 
returns to washington that night

when he takes office next month george bush 
will become at least the 13th president to ask congress to give him 
the power of lineitem veto 
odds are he will get the same answer no 
even supporters of the idea concede that allowing presidents to 
veto individual items in spending legislation as opposed to 
accepting or rejecting the entire bill is an idea whose time 
simply has not come 
the odds are its going to be very tough says rep bill 
archer rtexas who took bushs houston congressional seat in 1970 
and has been introducing legislation to establish the lineitem veto 
for years 
president grant was the first to ask congress for the power in 
1873 and president reagan has asked for it repeatedly calling it 
a powerful tool against wasteful or extravagant spending 
says archer more and more were packaging together big 
spending bills a lot of items in them dont make good sense and 
the president is faced with having to veto or sign the entire 
package 
in the 100th congress that adjourned in october 16 separate 
measures were introduced that would give lineitem veto power to the 
president all of them died in committee 
the reasons are largely institutional and political most 
legislators do not want presidents to intrude on congress spending 
authority and with democrats controlling the house and senate and a 
republican in the white house the desire to let a president snip 
pieces out of legislation is even more underwhelming 
rep marvin leath dtexas a member of the house budget 
committee says reagans efforts to win lineitem veto are a smoke 
screen used to cloud the administrations inability to solve the 
federal deficit problem democrats oppose the idea virtually 
unanimously he said 
says incoming house budget chairman leon panetta dcalif i 
dont think we ought to play with the constitutional balance that 
was set by our forefathers i think we ought to try to make the 
system work the way they designed it to 
sen pete domenici rnm ranking republican on the senate 
budget committee has supported lineitem veto proposals in the 
past but says he only expects to see one enacted if it is 
temporary limited and part of some overall budget deal 
i dont think its going anywhere he admits 
many observers believe that even if such a change were approved 
and it would probably take a constitutional amendment congress 
could easily get around it 
congress could simply redefine what line items are says 
carol cox president of the committee for a responsible federal 
budget a bipartisan group that monitors the budget process

there was no warning nowhere to run 
for 11 townspeople believed caught in the fireball of a crashing pan 
am jumbo jet one week later there is still no escape in this 
shattered town from the presence of disaster 
the effort to find the dead and to determine the cause 
stretches the length of the main street from the police station 
past the tall spire of holy trinity roman catholic church where 
relatives come for a word of comfort to the town hall now a 
temporary morgue 
a turn to the right leads to mounthoolie the grasscovered hill 
where more wreckage fell and beyond lie the forests bogs 
pastures lochs and reservoirs where the search goes on 
to the left the street heads past the tall gravestones around 
the church of scotland church and on to the ice rink also pressed 
into use as a morgue across the road the modern brick buildings of 
lockerbie academy have been taken over by rescue workers and by 
counselors assigned to help relatives of victims 
the churches and most of the homes and cottages in lockerbie are 
built of solemn brown stone that gives this market town and former 
rail center the look of a sepia print from late victorian times 
as the flowers at the town hall begin to wilt the town is left 
to wonder why its christmas was filled with death 
confronted with the horror of such loss we feel empty hurt 
confused the rev patrick keegans said at a requiem mass monday 
night 
as christ did on the cross we too scream at the father my 
god my god why have you abandoned me he does not seem to answer 
there is only silence 
the british investigative team has confirmed two possible causes 
are being examined an explosion in flight or structural failure 
one suitcase and an unspecified amount of wreckage have been sent 
to the royal armament research and development esablishment at fort 
halstead in southern england to determine whether they exhibit 
evidence of a preimpact explosion said chief investigator 
michael charles 
a day after the crash us officials said the embassy in 
helsinki finland had received a threat on dec 5 against pan am 
service between frankfurt west germany and the united states 
those threats were thought to be related to the abu nidal group of 
palestinian radicals 
finnish authorities said they knew who made the call and said he 
had not been out of the country since dec 5 
others claimed responsibility after the crash including one man 
who telephoned the associated press in london anonymously to say 
iranians had done it in revenge for the domestic airliner shot down 
by the uss vincennes in the persian gulf in july 
pan am flight 103 began dec 21 in frankfurt with a boeing 727 
with 115 passengers aboard of whom 70 got off in london in london 
45 changed to the boeing 747 to carry on to new york and 198 more 
passengers and a new crew joined the flight 
the change of planes at londons heathrow international airport 
took 65 minutes 25 minutes beyond the scheduled departure time of 
6 pm it left london with 243 passengers 13 cabin attendants and a 
cockpit crew of three 
as the 18yearold clipper maid of the sea reached a cruising 
altitude of 31000 feet it broke up and disappeared from radar at 
719 pm the cockpit voice recorder ends with a muffled noise and 
no indication the crew detected anything amiss investigation of the 
noise continues 
in lockerbie the wreckage threw up a towering fireball 
witnesses thought it might have been 300 feet close by the 
southbound lanes of the a74 highway linking western england and

four houses in the adjacent sherwood crescent were obliterated as 
the wreckage plowed a furrow 100 feet long and 20 feet deep in the 
sticky red clay at least 20 homes were set ablaze and scores more 
suffered gashes in roofs and shattered glass as pieces of the 
aircraft were reduced to shrapnel 
the crew of a british airways boeing 757 flying at 22000 feet 
saw the flash on the ground and reported it to controllers 
mangled seats and debris showered the houses along rosebank 
cresent across the railroad tracks and one engine slammed on 
alexandra drive all along the south side of the town 
bodies were scattered in the grass of mounthoolie a 150foot 
high hill east of town 
many injuries were expected but only five people were taken to a 
hospital on the night of the crash two were released immediately 
the cockpit fell three miles east of lockerbie just beyond the 
stone wall of a country church at tundergarth mains 
subsequently the main search area extended 15 miles east of 
lockerbie to the esk river and mail and other lightweight debris 
apparently from the jet was found as far as 70 miles away 
the wide trail of debris left no doubt the jet had broken apart 
in the air 
the crash brought a rescue force which grew to 1500 people 
including about 600 searchers on the ground it also brought prime 
minister margaret thatcher prince andrew us ambassador charles 
h price ii and scores of journalists to lockerbie a town of 2500 
people with three telephone booths 
on wednesday the royal air forces 60footlong queen 
elizabeth trucks designed to carry aircraft wreckage backed up 
traffic as they threaded the hairpin turn past the world war i 
memorial on their way to a temporary storage depot 
west german investigators looked at baggage handling in 
frankfurt when asked if a bomb may have slipped through airport 
security checks state economics ministry spokesman thomas pier 
said the frankfurt prosecutors investigation which concerns 
airport security checks of passengers and handcarried bags so far 
rules that out 
scotland yard said tuesday that its inquiry at heathrow is 
continuing led by the commander of its antiterrorist squad george 
churchillcoleman 
the disaster was reminiscent of the crash of an air india boeing 
747 off ireland on june 23 1985 killing all 329 aboard there was 
no distress signal no exclamation of alarm on the cockpit voice 
recorder as the plane broke up also at 31000 feet 
investigators found no trace of a bomb in three tons of debris 
and 131 bodies recovered from 6000 feet of water a coroners jury 
convened in cork ireland concluded only that the disaster resulted 
from a sudden catastrophe the nature and origin of which 
remains uncertain 
however an indian judicial inquiry concluded in march 1986 that 
a suitcase bomb had been put aboard in canada and indian 
authorities said they suspected militant sikh separatists it took 
22 months for japanese investigators to conclude that structral 
failure was at fault in a boeing 747 crash that killed 520 people 
the worst singleplane accident ever in 1985

communist chinas first officially approved movie 
with sex scenes has been screened to sellout crowds in canton the 
china news service said tuesday 
widows village is about the experiences of three young 
couples in a fishing village before and after the communist victory 
in 1949 the films director has recommended that children not watch 
it the official report said 
it said the movie required some special scenes showing couples 
lovemaking but didnt elaborate on how graphic the scenes were or 
why they were necessary to the plot it said the story dealt with 
the couples experiences under the influence of strange marriage 
customs but gave no details 
it didnt show anything too revealing the report quoted one 
viewer as saying it could be considered an artistic movie that 
exposes the damage done to sex by feudal thinking 
china has been undergoing one of its most open and creative 
periods in moviemaking and other arts since the communist takeover 
the overall trend has been toward greater openness in content and 
experimentation in style but there also are periodic attacks on 
works considered too liberal 
two weeks ago censors who have the power to ban movies held 
their first open session ever and approved a movie in which the 
hero commits suicide beijing also opened its first exhibit of nude 
paintings last week 
on the other hand authorities recently have held book burnings 
in several cities destroying chinese books considered pornographic 
and illegal translations of books by american authors irving wallace 
and jacqueline susann known for their steamy novels 
the china news service said widows village opened saturday 
in major theaters in the southern city of canton after a oneday 
preview that was sold out the film was made jointly by the pearl 
river movie studio of canton and the hong kong silver city 
organization 
china has no formal movie rating system although one has been 
proposed the report quoted the director wang jin as saying the 
contents were not suitable for children few viewers brought their 
children it said 
china under communism has been generally prudish about sex and 
scornful of sometimes graphic western movies and books as 
encouraging crime and moral degeneration 
the censors recently have allowed greater frankness however 
the 1987 movie the old well which won international awards 
depicted a love triangle and contained a passionate kissing scene 
this years red sorghum which won an award at the west berlin 
international film festival showed a woman being carried off with 
the implication that she was raped but contained nothing explicit 
it also showed a man urinating into a jug of wine 
the ministry of culture is drafting a law that would define what 
is permissible in art and says this will free artists from the 
whims of individual censors many artists fear it also could freeze 
experimentation and liberalization 
although widows village is the first chinese film approved 
by communist officials that contains sex scenes it wont be the 
first time some chinese viewers have seen such scenes 
foreign videos many pirated circulate widely in chinas cities 
on a private basis 
chinese tv also has shown some western programs with love scenes 
that are more daring than what previously was allowed in the theater

prime minister noboru takeshita seeking to erase 
the shadow of a stock scandal that tainted his government 
reshuffled the cabinet on tuesday with an aggressive new justice 
minister at the forefront 
the 20member cabinet does not include any politicians linked to 
the socalled recruit scandal which led to the resignation of the 
finance minister and 16 other influential politicians and business 
leaders 
the scandal and the passage last week of a tax reform package 
that includes a 3 percent sales tax have hurt the popularity of 
takeshitas government 
there were changes in four ministries touched by the scandal 
even though the ministers themselves were not accused of personal 
involvement 
takeshita left in place his foreign minister his chief cabinet 
secretary and two top leaders of the liberal democratic party who 
are strong contenders to succeed him as prime minister 
the chief secretary keizo obuchi said the changes were in 
keeping with takeshitas promises to tighten political discipline 
seen as a key to these efforts is the new justice minister 
takashi hasegawa 76 who heads a parliamentary committee on 
political ethics 
i am aware that the public is losing confidence in politicians 
business leaders and public officials hasegawa said in a news 
conference following his appointment it is a serious matter to 
rectify it for japan to be trusted in the international arena we 
have to start with establishing a trustworthy political system 
in the scandal a number of influential politicans and business 
leaders profited from bargain purchases of unlisted stock shares 
that rose sharply in price after their public offering 
while not illegal the transactions in shares of recruitcosmos 
a real estate company have been viewed as unethical donations 
apart from the new justice ministry appointment analysts said 
they expected no significant changes in government policies with the 
new cabinet 
besides obuchi others who kept their positions were foreign 
minister sousuke uno defense agency directorgeneral kichiro 
tazawa and finance minister tatsuo murayama who was appointed 
saturday 
murayama replaced kiichi miyazawa who quit to take 
responsibility for an aides involvement in the scandal 
two contenders to succeed takeshita retained key party posts 
shintaro abe as secretarygeneral of the liberal democratic party 
and michio watanabe as party policy chief 
also keeping his post was masayoshi ito chairman of the partys 
executive council 
it is customary for prime ministers to rotate senior party 
members through ministerial posts without changing the power balance 
among major factions and the new cabinet reflects this 
takeshitas own faction has six portfolios while those of abe 
miyazawa and former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone have four each 
and that of senior politician toshio komoto has two 
in a word i have a feeling of stability takeshita said 
after announcing the changes im looking forward to them all 
working hard 
a poll this month by the newspaper mainichi shimbun showed the 
takeshita administration had only 18 percent support down from 30 
percent when the prime minister took office 13 months ago 
but tokyo university political scientist takashi inoguchi said 
takeshita may be on a temporary low but by next summer he will be 
shining again 
inoguchi suggested that takeshita can boost his popularity by 
faring well in a meeting next month with presidentelect george bush 
and possibly holding a summit soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
an annual reshuffle of cabinet posts is a firmly established 
custom in japan said seizaburo sato a professor of political 
science at tokyo university takeshita doesnt want to upset the 
status quo

comedian cheech marin is attracting a younger 
audience than usual with his latest film 
marin provided the raucous voice for tito the hyperactive 
chihuahua in the disney animated film oliver amp company 
doing tito was like recording a comedy album i went into the 
studio and did the voice which i really enjoyed marin said i 
always read the lines by myself i was never in the studio with 
bette midler or billy joel the character kind of developed in the 
recording sessions his romance with georgette emerged late in the 
production 
tito is a lively character constantly in motion hot wiring 
electronic equipment and flirting with georgette the snooty poodle 
i was encouraged to adlib but id say i just gave about 75 
percent of the lines as they were written marin said the 
natural energy of a chihuahua played right into that feeling 
titos popularity has sparked rumors the character may appear in 
another film an idea that pleases marin 
i love animation ive always considered it an idealized form 
of film making he said and i really dig the tito character

chris way and hugh holborn figured 
they were on to something when customers at ways seafood restaurant 
began stealing bottles of his homemade hot sauce 
now the partners appear to be well on their way to successfully 
marketing datl doit hot sauce a liquid fire that way 
concocted two years ago using a locally grown vicious little 
vegetable called the datil pepper 
the sauce and a new product hellish relish now are sold in 
1000 stores from louisiana to north carolina 
its a long slow process but little by little were working 
our way up against the big guys holborn said gearing up for that 
challenge theyre learning such topics as product liability and 
shelflife testing 
while way and holborn both 32 hope to someday reign over the 
hot sauce world right now they are doing everything from paperwork 
to grinding peppers that often leave them soaking their hands in 
buckets of ice even after wearing two layers of thick gloves 
these things react with water too so cleaning up afterwards 
is like chernobyl way said 
although the small green peppers are native to north florida 
holborn said no one really knows how they got here 
i traced them back to the 1700s in havana so they must have 
gotten here from some sort of spanish influence holborn said 
they are planning a third product a datil pepper jelly 
we havent picked a name yet maybe helly jelly holborn

sales of existing homes rose 11 percent in 
november the first advance since august a real estate trade group 
reported tuesday 
analysts credited the rebound in part to the strong 
participation of baby boomers in the housing market saying their 
numbers alone should help keep sales steady in 1989 despite 
forecasts of higher mortgage rates 
the national association of realtors said existing singlefamily 
homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 371 million 
units in november compared to an october sales pace of 367 million 
units 
sales had shown no improvement at all in october after dropping 
by 11 percent in september 
sales of new homes have been rising as well in october sales of 
new singlefamily homes climbed to 733000 units the highest level 
in 20 months the government will report new home sales for november 
on friday 
analysts attributed the sales upswing in part to a growing number 
of buyers in the marketplace 
the fact is the bulk of the baby boom is now being felt in 
housing markets across the country said john tuccillo chief 
economist for the realtors group the strong pace of existing home 
sales in november is more a tribute to the numbers of buyers out in 
the market than it is to any particular shortterm economic 
conditions 
the november gain was the first increase since a 22 percent rise 
last august 
the price of an existing home edged down slightly to 87900 in 
november compared to an october median price of 88100 
tuccillo said he expected home sale prices nationally to increase 
48 percent for all of 1988 about in line with the overall rise in 
consumer prices that would be down from a 66 percent price 
increase recorded in 1987 
the price moderation was attributed to a shift in sales from the 
more expensive markets of the northeast to the less expensive 
markets in the midwest 
the northeast remained the most expensive place to buy a home 
with a median price of 142500 in november up 59 percent from a 
year ago the typical home in the west sold for 122300 in 
november up 6 percent from a year ago 
homes in the south sold for 80300 in november an increase of 
14 percent from a year earlier while the midwest remained the 
least expensive housing area at 66700 an increase of 36 percent 
from a year ago 
many economists had been expecting a drop in sales of both new 
and existing homes in 1989 because of rising mortgage rates last 
week 30year fixedrate mortgages averaged 1068 percent and many 
analysts are predicting they will hit 115 percent by spring 
however tuccillo said the large number of adults in their 30s 
and 40s who are looking for homes had prompted him to revise his 
outlook for 1989 to show sales of around 338 million down only 42 
percent from an expected 353 million sales this year 
in november the sales increase was led by a 46 percent rise in 
sales in the northeast which climbed to an annual rate of 680000 
units up 3 percent from a year ago 
sales were up 43 percent in the midwest to an annual rate of 
960000 units this is 79 percent above the sales rate a year ago 
as this region continues to benefit from a boom in export sales by 
manufacturing companies 
sales were unchanged in the south at an annual rate of 140 
million units but this was 111 percent higher than a year ago 
reflecting the fact that the region has begun to recover somewhat 
from depressed conditions caused by a slump in the oil patch 
the west was the only region of the country reporting a 
monthtomonth sales decline a 7 percent setback which left the 
annual sales pace at 660000 units still nearly 18 percent higher 
than a year ago

south asian foreign ministers met 
tuesday to lay the groundwork for a sevennation summit that will 
bring new pakistani leader benazir bhutto facetoface for the first 
time with indian prime minister rajiv gandhi 
ms bhutto and gandhi are the first leaders of the long 
antagonistic neighbors not saddled with firsthand memories of the 
bitter and bloody 1947 partition of british colonial india into two 
nations predominantly hindu india and overwhelmingly moslem 
pakistan the two have fought three postindependence wars 
the venue for ms bhutto and gandhis first encounter is a 
threeday summit of the south asian association for regional 
cooperation starting thursday 
other members of the 3yearold organization are bangladesh 
bhutan the maldives nepal and sri lanka 
ms bhutto who was sworn in as prime minister dec 2 is 
expected to have three meetings with gandhi according to pakistani 
foreign secretary humayun khan 
foreign ministers of member states met tuesday and will meet 
again wednesday pakistani foreign minister yaqub khan was elected 
1989 chairman of the foreign ministers council 
he told tuesdays session that members should work together to 
improve social and economic conditions for their 11 billion people 
whose literacy rates range from 20 percent in bhutan to 93 percent 
in the maldives 
the nations of the south asian association for regional 
cooperation where onefifth of the world population lives 
continue to face problems such as infant mortality limited life 
expectancy high population growth lack of adequate shelter and 
absolute poverty he said 
indian foreign minister narasimha rao called for tangible 
results what is needed is to emerge from the twilight of 
hesitation into the confident dawn of fullfledged regional 
cooperation rao said 
the association does not deal with political or security issues 
this precludes it from taking up sensitive questions like the 
indianpakistani border dispute in kashmir a mountainous frontier 
region where pakistan occupies territory claimed by india 
instead it tries to concentrate on trade culture health and 
environment 
even the environment can be too hot to discuss on specific lines 
floodprone bangladesh for example would like the group to 
draft a joint approach for disasters that beset the region with 
deadly frequency in bangladeshs case its perennially overflowing 
rivers originate in the hills of india and nepal during the rainy 
season these rivers can broaden into an inland sea upon reaching 
lowlying bangladesh where last summers floods killed 1500 people 
india says antiflood measures should be dealt with bilaterally 
the associations most momentous agreements have been 
diplomatically worded and nonspecific pacts to cooperate in 
suppressing terrorism building food reserves and expressing concern 
over the nuclear arms race 
members see their organizations strength in the forum it 
provides to express their views and get to know each other better 
this is not an organization that is given to dramatic 
results said abul ahsan of bangladesh secretarygeneral of the 
organization 
notable achievements he said include directdial telephones and 
air fare concessions among members nations

at least 12 percent of the people leaving bars 
in the minneapolisst paul area on any given day are legally drunk 
says a study based on researchers observations of bar patrons 
behavior 
what portion of the 12 percent are drivers is not yet known 
said richard sykes professor of speech communication at the 
university of minnesota and director of the survey the national 
institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism sponsored the study and 
james schaefer director of the universitys office of alcohol amp 
other drug abuse prevention served as a consultant 
teams of trained observers spent at least 10 hours in each of 65 
bars in ramsey and hennepin counties collecting data on the 
behavior of 3700 patrons drinking about 9000 drinks 
the observers sipping ice water or soft drinks focused on 
selected patrons from the time they entered the bar until they left 
the study disproved my theory which was that people drink more 
in groups than if they were alone sykes said 
among the studys findings 
bar patrons consumed an average of 23 drinks a visit whether 
they were alone or in groups the lone patrons however tended to 
stay a shorter time and drink faster than those who are in groups 
a larger proportion of women than men were becoming legally 
intoxicated to the extent that women tried to keep up with the men 
in their consumption rate sykes said they were at greater risk 
because of their smaller stature 
women drank about as much as men in the bars but they tended to 
drink more slowly and stay longer 
fewer than half of patrons were drinking in groups contrary to 
some expectations and 95 percent of those who came in alone were 
men 
elderly males showed a tendency to drink heavily often at 
neighborhood bars in the morning 
what didnt prove to be true was the stereotype of groups of 
young men getting drunk sykes said instead they found young and 
old men and women becoming intoxicated 
its a rather complex picture he said 
the survey sampled a crosssection of about 12 percent of the 565 
establishments that the researchers could identify as bars in the 
metro area sykes said the actual observations took place during 
the first eight months of 1986 and sykes continues to analyze the 
data for various factors 
right now we are working on the differences between bars he 
said 
richard rowley a university graduate student writing his 
doctoral dissertation on the study managed the research staff 
mainly undergraduate honors students and graduate students 
rowley began by attending bartending school not only to know how 
drinks were mixed and their alcohol content but also to pick up an 
understanding of bar culture he said 
then they advertised for observers eliminating those who 
obviously just expected to have a good time the observers were 
trained to estimate height and weight accurately they studied 
standard bar glassware to learn how much of a drink each type of 
glass would contain

two french girls captured by palestinian 
guerrillas more than a year ago were still missing tuesday a day 
after their captors said they had been freed and put on a plane to 
paris 
relatives of 7yearold marielaure valente and her 6yearold 
sister virginie said in paris that abu nidals fatahrevolutionary 
council guerrilla group had refused to give them a precise date for 
the girls return 
the groups spokesman walid khaled told the associated press 
that nidal himself said goodbye to the girls and approved 
arrangements to send them home 
khaled also said however that i cannot set a specific date 
for their arrival in paris 
that contradicted khaleds announcement monday that the girls 
were on their way to paris by plane he refused to explain the 
discrepancy 
on saturday khaled said the girls would be freed within 24 hours 
as a christmas gift for the worlds children 
nidals group announced nov 8 that it had captured the sisters 
their mother jacqueline valente and five belgians in a boat off 
the gaza strip ms valente and the belgians have not been released 
when asked why the adults were still held khaled said the 
girls are innocent they have not been tainted 
the others are tools of the zionist mossad israels secret 
service and have made valuable confessions he added repeating a 
charge made when the abductions were first announced israel has 
denied they were spies 
in his latest statement khaled said nidal whose real name is 
sabri elbanna and his deputy salim ahmed met the girls to bid 
them farewell at a secret fatahrevolutionary council combat outpost 
in lebanon 
the two comrades expressed their satisfaction over the special 
security arrangements taken to enable the two girls to reunite 
safely with their family 
he refused to say when the meeting was held i have reported it 
today thats all he said 
the sisters are very happy because theyre being released 
theyre eating chocolates and have put on weight khaled added 
other palestinian sources were skeptical that nidal who split 
with plo chief yasser arafat in 1974 met the girls in lebanon 
abu nidal has not been anywhere in lebanon for quite a long 
time said one source speaking on condition of anonymity i 
cant believe he came in all of a sudden just to say goodbye to the 
two french girls 
nidal split from the palestine liberation organization in 1974 
two years later he formed his underground group and has since 
topped wanted lists around the world for masterminding aircraft 
hijackings bombings and assassinations 
a man who answered the telephone in khaleds office suggested 
that bad weather delayed the girls arrival home several 
mediterranean countries have been lashed by winter storms since the 
weekend 
the childrens father pascal betille grandmother brigitte 
valente and jacqueline valentes brotherinlaw andre metral 
spent the weekend in beirut and met with khaled 
never during our meetings were we able to obtain despite 
our insistance a precise date for the liberation of marielaure and 
virginie said metral 
i think this will go on several days more perhaps until 
friday he was quoted as saying by agence francepresse 
ms valente gave birth to a girl in captivity and is expecting 
another child next month she had been living with fernand 
houtekins one of belgian captives 
the other captives are houtekins brother emmanuel and his wife 
godelieve and their two children laurent 17 and valerie 16 
khaleds statement quoted nidal as saying the release of the 
sisters was a slap in the face of the real imperialists 
terrorists and murderers headed by reagan 
the statement denounced reagans announcement last week that he 
was considering military action against an alleged chemical weapons 
plant in libya which bankrolls nidals group 
they the americans should bear the responsibilty for any 
expected reactions to this threat by revolutionary forces the 
statement warned

nosebleeds and headaches as a result of the decompression said gary 
chernenko a hospital spokesman 
two national transportation safety board officials who inspected 
the aircraft plan to send the metal flap that peeled off the 
fuselage to the agencys washington dc laboratory for testing 
itll go back to our laboratory in washington our 
metallurgical lab and theyll use an electron microscope to 
pinpoint the type of failures on the metal itself ntsb air safety 
investigator pamela kleckner said today 
the area of the fuselage containing the tear is newer than the 
aircraft it had been replacement skin said ntsb spokesman ted 
lopatkiewicz in washington 
it could be six months before a final determination is made on 
what happened kleckner said 
passenger sam piazza 55 a former pilot from boca raton fla 
said he and his wife at first thought a bomb had exploded a 
possible cause of last weeks crash of pan am flight 103 with 258 
aboard in scotland 
we were cruising along and you could hear the rush of the wind 
and the pitch of the wind and all of a sudden you could hear a big 
pop he said 
i looked up and i could see sunlight shining through the 
cabin roof said another passenger david moore of phoenix 
the opening in the crown of the fuselage was about a 14inch 
square hole said federal aviation administration spokesman jack 
barker in atlanta those things start with a crack and end up as a 
hole 
a fiveinch crack had been found on the fuselage of the plane in 
an inspection in july 1986 and corrosion and a tiny wing crack were 
found in april 1987 said bobbie mardis of the faas safety data 
branch in oklahoma city 
lopatkiewicz asked whether the previous cracks were suspected in 
mondays incident said that we dont know i suppose its 
possible but we dont have any information on the maintenance and 
the timing on when things had been done 
federal officials also said mechanical problems including a 
failure to maintain cabin pressure in june 1986 had forced the jet 
to land at least seven times during the past five years before 
mondays incident 
other reasons for the unscheduled landings included an engine 
compressor stall in 1986 and a loss of engine oil in 1986 
however eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak in miami said the 
20yearold jet was maintained acording to faa guidelines and had 
an inspection of the crown in september thats the whole top area 
from the cockpit to the tail the results of the september 
inspection were not immediately available 
from what i understand from what theyve pulled up on this 
plane theres nothing unusual in its history she said 
nothing i saw there would qualify as an emergency said fred 
farrar an faa spokesman in washington who had reviewed reports on 
the aircrafts mechanical difficulties 
the aviation industry recently has focused on the problem of 
jetliner aging due in part to an april 28 incident in which the 
roof of a 19yearold boeing 737 tore off an aloha airlines flight 
at 24000 feet killing one person and injuring 61 
the following month an american airlines boeing 727 was forced 
to make an unscheduled landing in detroit because of a 15inch crack 
in the wheel well that was attributed to metal fatigue 
the aloha accident prompted a federal investigation into the 
aging fleet of jets and the faa ordered airlines to replace rivets 
believed to have caused cracks boeing also has undertaken studies 
of its older airplanes to determine the effect of aging on 
airworthiness 
federal officials today continued their background check of the 
eastern plane which remained here after the forced landing and 
were looking at other planes of the same type authorities said 
boeing spokesman t craig martin said monday he doesnt know 
anything about the aircrafts previous problems 
this plane was designed so that if there is some kind of 
puncture in the skin the pressure will be let off safely thats 
what happened the plane landed safely the spokesman in seattle 
said 
the incident occurred at 31000 feet about 50 miles or several 
minutes flying time north of charleston said garland jones the 
flights first officer 
oxygen masks were deployed pilot john sullivan a 20year 
veteran took the plane down to 10000 feet an altitude at which 
passengers could breathe without the masks said jones 
some passengers later complained their masks didnt work jones 
said they probably didnt realize that the masks have to be pulled 
by hand to initiate the oxygen flow 
others said their ears ached for hours after landing 
aside from the pressure loss the jet experienced no other 
trouble said the faas barker 
passenger moore 39 said he was worried about the flight from 
the beginning 
before takeoff there was a definite wind noise not from the 
back of the plane but from above our heads moore said the 
second officer came back looked at it and decided it wasnt 
anything 
but jones said the second officer was only helping flight 
attendants close the aft door before takeoff 
eastern which does not service west virginia flew the 104 
passengers and six crew members to atlanta

mines laid by iran and iraq are 
believed to be still adrift in the persian gulf where shipping is 
increasing following the ceasefire a us navy officier said 
tuesday 
lt cmdr john k ross skipper of the mine sweeper uss fearless 
said the shattalarab waterway that forms the southern boundary 
between the two countries is particularly risky 
about 180 mines have been discovered in the gulf since us and 
other foreign navies intervened to protect shipping from iranian 
attack in july 1987 ross said 
i hope theyre all gone but i believe more mines are still 
here in the gulf he said 
he noted that western navy patrols have not ventured into 
northern waters where iranian and iraqi forces were active until 
the aug 20 ceasefire ended the eightyear war 
weve searched up to kuwait but no further someone has to 
check the shattalarab said ross 
as shipping in the gulf increases us officers have voiced 
fears that rough winter seas could tear moored mines from their 
anchors to float south into shipping lanes 
no ship has hit a mine since the ceasefire 
ross declined to estimate how many mines remain but us sources 
put the number as high as 200 mainly in the northern sector 
iran claims it has cleared mines in northern waters and other 
sectors since the ceasefire but there has been no independent 
confirmation 
ross said 166 mines 82 moored to the seabed and 84 floating 
were discovered between july 1987 and the ceasefire 
of these he said 16 were found off the united arab emirates port 
of khor fakkan in the gulf of oman and eight near irans rostam oil 
platform in the southern gulf 
eight were discovered near the shah olam shoals in the central 
gulf off qatar another 18 were laid by the iranian vessel iran ajar 
or found aboard it when us forces seized it in that sector last 
year he said 
eighteen mines were discovered near irans farsi island a base 
for speedboatborne revolutionary guards who attacked shipping in 
the northern waterway and 14 near kuwaits main alahmadi oil 
terminal in the northern sector ross added 
another 1520 mines have been found since august he said 
it is believed iran planted most mines which were found by mine 
sweepers of the usled foreign navy armada aided by some gulf 
states 
ross vessel and the mine sweeper uss inflict and the uss 
raleigh an amphibious warfare vessel that acts as supply ship 
currently are berthed at a united arab emirates port for rest and 
resupply 
four other us mine sweepers operate in the gulf 
although some foreign navies have retrenched their forces since 
the ceasefire ross said he did not believe further cuts were 
likely soon iran and iraq still are negotiating a peace treaty

the priest who provided a haven for an ailing 
suspect arrested last january in the 1951 strangling of an 
8yearold girl said he believes the former carnival worker did not 
kill the girl 
i believe hes innocent he brought the subject up once in a 
conversation and said i didnt do it said the rev david 
hagan who runs a philadelphia shelter where the suspect william 
redmond lived while his case was being processed 
its a gut feeling i have that he was telling the truth he 
said 
redmonds trial in the april 1951 slaying has been postponed 
indefinitely and the frail 66yearold defendant has been allowed 
to return to his nebraska home to die 
redmond who lived quietly for more than 30 years in grand 
island neb was brought to pennsylvania last january when state 
police trooper malcolm murphy said he had tracked him down as the 
elusive killer in the old murder case 
the trooper said he had a dramatic confession in the 1951 death 
of jane marie althoff a chester girl whose body was found in a 
carnival truck on the grounds where redmond operated a ferris wheel 
however defense attorney michael malloy has contended the 
confession is tainted and that redmond was pressured into giving it 
following 14 hours of intense interrogation 
he said the statement does not jibe with the facts of the girls 
death and was given just weeks after redmond had been in intensive 
care in a nebraska hospital

no one knows if there is even any land 
there but the owners of an 11acre parcel have paid three years 
worth of back taxes anyway town officials said tuesday 
victor nascimento said he and his relatives decided to pay the 
222 tax bill so officials in this rural rhode island community 
would not auction the land he and a brother now dead bought sight 
unseen in 1971 for back taxes 
weve got 18 years invested in this what were hoping to do is 
hang in there for a year or two and see what happens nascimento 
said were definitely sure there is land there but where it is 
i dont know 
when the nascimentos bought the parcel for 2100 they could not 
afford a title search so they signed a quitclaim deed which 
relieves the seller of any liability 
they paid taxes every year between 1970 and 1985 when a town 
official informed nascimentos wife lois that the lots status was 
in question 
although town officials concede they dont know where the land is 
either they said the law obliges them to collect taxes on all land 
for which a deed has been filed at town hall 
this time nascimento is determined to find out whether the land 
exists 
in addition to the tax bill nascimento paid 233 for a title 
search and advertising fees 
if he finds out he was swindled on the land sale nascimento 
plans to try to recover the 2800 in taxes he and his family have 
paid since 1970 
if theres no land they shouldnt be taxing it nascimento

york times 
but glenna freedman press agent for the show said producers had 
no immediate plans to close to 51 million show the only musical 
of broadways meager fall season 
legs diamond is a sobering interlude of minimumsecurity 
imprisonment that may inspire you to pull out a pen and attend to 
longneglected tasks like finishing last sundays crossword puzzle

rich also slammed allen the australianborn singer who stars in 
and wrote the music and lyrics for the musical 
if theres any mystery to legs diamond it is the one 
attending mr allen not the gangster he purports to play here is a 
performer with a single expression a popeyed 
idareyounottoloveme grin and a harsh singing voice as taut 
as his face 
michael kuchwara of the associated press called the show a 
musical in search of a leading man he praised the score but found 
the book written by harvey fierstein and charles suppon the 
skimpiest story this side of starlight express 
clive barnes in the new york post wondered could it possibly 
be as bad as it seemed indeed as people said the good news is that 
it isnt the bad news is that it isnt all that better either 
howard kissel in the new york daily news said the musical isnt 
even bad enought to laugh at its just dull

a retiring senator angry that taxpayers 
shelled out nearly 16 million for president reagans 1985 
inauguration is counting on one paragraph of a massive defense bill 
to keep history from repeating itself 
but just how sen william proxmires provision will affect 
presidentelect bushs party remains unclear both to inaugural 
officials and the pentagon which accounted for 10 million of the 
federal spending in 1985 
tucked deep in the defense authorization act for fiscal 1989 is 
the wisconsin democrats paragraph saying the defense secretary 
should seek reimbursement for troops used at private inaugural 
events and only volunteers should be used at such events 
despite some confusion about the provision at the pentagon and 
the private presidential inaugural committee planning the bush 
festivities both say they will heed the guideline 
the department of defense does intend to seek reimbursement 
where appropriate for support rendered said capt gail hayes a 
spokesman for the armed forces inaugural committee she defined 
where appropriate as meaning private events but had no further 
details 
well make sure that we comply said stephen studdert 
executive director of the pic if they military men and women 
are not supposed to be somewhere they wont be if were required 
to reimburse the defense department we will in every case 
jan baran general counsel to the pic maintained there had been 
no comprehensive change in the law dealing with inaugurations 
but he said the committee has worked out guidelines with government 
agencies and there is unprecedented scrutiny of what will or will 
not be used that will require reimbursement to the government 
a general accounting office report last year found that the 
pentagon alone spent 10 million on 1985 inaugural activities 
including the use of soldiers as chauffeurs photographers and 
escorts six other agencies spent nearly 6 million more 
ron tammen proxmires administrative assistant said the new 
provision is meant to relieve military people of chores like driving 
vip spouses to beauty parlors and restrict federal subsidies of 
balls and other events he called virtual political payoffs 
neither baran studdert nor hayes could say how much repayment 
the pentagon could expect from troop participation in private events 
next month however the pic officials said they are trying to cut 
down on federal employees and use more contractors and volunteers 
for entertainment coatchecking and other activities 
in the past many government employees from all sorts of 
agencies would work on the inaugural that is extremely curtailed 
this time baran said 
the fiscal impact of the new policy is hard to measure 
studdert said it may not add on to the overall cost of 20 to 
25 million we may save on other categories by increasing 
volunteer use thats our hope 
hayes said her committee is still awaiting a request from the 
pic but does not anticipate a drop in the number of people it will 
be asked to assign to inaugural duties our best estimate is that 
dod participation will be 8500 people she said the same as in 
1985 
the bush inaugural is being billed as the most open ever but the 
schedule of events jan 1822 is still heavily weighted toward 
exclusive private events 
baran said an event is considered public if 50 percent of the 
tickets are available to the public he said that would apply to 
eight inaugural events among them a parade a pageant a 
childrens festival an american tribute to democracy and a 
thanksgiving service at washington cathedral 
he said the other 15 events are private nine balls a worship 
service a dinner a gala a vice presidential reception a salute 
to the first lady and a celebration for young americans 
it remains to be seen exactly how the pentagon and the private 
inaugural committee will interpret the congressional recommendations 
studdert said a military band playing hail to the chief for 
example would be a case of that unit performing a usual function 
and therefore would not entail reimbursement 
but tammen said congress intends that the pentagon be reimbursed 
no matter what function the troops perform if the event is private 
we specifically meant to prevent the use of the military at balls 
and galas which are exclusively to entertain the vips bush 
supporters and republicans he said

thousands of chinese youths demonstrated tuesday 
in nanking calling on their government to punish african students 
who battled chinese over the weekend an american witness said 
it was the third major antiblack protest in the jiangsu 
province capital in three days after several days of violence 
police for the first time took stern measures to control the crowds 
hundreds of officers many wearing riot gear filled the city 
some cruised the streets in trucks others stood on street corners 
pushing back crowds 
a band of 200 police stood guard around the citys main hotel for 
foreigners said the witness david chen 19 of princeton junction 
nj 
chinese authorities meanwhile released five americans who had 
been held incommunicado with 140 african students in a guest house 
on the outskirts of nanking the africans continued to be held 
because chinese authorities said they could not guarantee their 
safety one american and about 20 students from western europe and 
japan stayed with them 
police forced the africans and the other students to the guest 
house monday night after chinese authorities refused to allow the 
africans to take trains to beijing the africans feared authorities 
in nanking could not protect them following a clash with chinese 
students saturday night and antiblack riots sunday 
two of the released americans elizabeth morrison and elizabeth 
chace said police dragged them and the other students from the 
nanking train station monday night 
five soldiers grabbed elizabeth and then five soldiers grabbed 
me and they just dragged us out of the station said ms chace of 
weston mass speaking by telephone from nanking 
they were just dragging everyone out said ms morrisson 20 
of prairie village kan some people struggled so violently they 
were hurt 
the clashes and demonstrations which began saturday are the 
latest in a series of incidents between chinese and some of the 
1500 african students invited to show beijings solidarity with 
other third world nations 
relations between africans and chinese have been strained 
chinese are often openly racist saying black people are dirty they 
also look down on some african countries for their poverty 
the problem is compounded because african students in china are 
mostly single men who spend up to six years and wish to date 
chinese women 
many chinese students also are dissatisfied with relatively 
lowpaying jobs upon graduation and scant freedom to choose their 
profession the clash saturday seemed like a ready excuse to vent 
such grievances 
the demonstrations in nanking are the largest student marches 
since the winter of 198687 when hundreds of thousands of students 
in dozens of cities demanded democracy 
the nanking demonstrations appear similar to marches earlier this 
year in beijing when students called on the government to punish 
the murderers of a student in these incidents law and order has 
been emphasized and political slogans muted 
the clashes in nanking began saturday when african students at 
hehai university wanted to bring two chinese women to a party but 
refused a guards request for the womens identification 
in a brawl that followed 11 chinese and two africans were 
injured the official xinhua news agency reported 
demonstrations and rockthrowing continued sunday and monday with 
thousands of chinese participating american witnesses said police 
stood by as chinese broke windows and ransacked african student 
dormitories they yaid 
kill the black devils and black devils go home the 
crowd chanted sunday 
on monday a leaflet was circulated calling for tough punishment 
for the africans 
at a time when compatriots are being beaten and the law is 
trampled on said chen quoting from the leaflet at a time when 
the race is being humiliated any tolerance we show to the thugs is 
a betrayal to the race 
demonstrations continued tuesday night chen said he saw 2500 
youths massing at a building north of the university he said a 
group of about 300 policeman blocked the crowds path another group 
of about 1000 gathered two hours later in another part of the city 
hundreds of officers kept them off the streets he said 
they were all calling for the arrest of the blacks involved in 
the fight on christmas eve chen said 
about 200 police officers with helmets and truncheons guarded the 
entrance to the jinling hotel the citys tallest building chen 
said he saw no violence and no arrests 
he quoted the student leaflet as calling on chinese to rise 
together and take action 
where is the honor of the chinese race the leaflet said 
where is the honor of the law of the peoples republic of china 
most chinese are members of the han race and for centuries their 
concept of nationhood has been based on their shared race and 
culture 
a us diplomat said officials from several african countries met 
with chinese officials in nanking some of the countries involved 
were zaire ghana the congo benin burundi cameron senegal and 
niger

legislators in uzbekistan have rejected a budget 
plan from the republics leadership and written their own tass said 
tuesday 
this is without precedent the official news agency said in 
reporting the action 
the opposition shown by a majority of the uzbek legislators came 
less than two months after a few representatives to the supreme 
soviet made history by casting the first handful of no votes in 
more than 60 years 
tass did not give the date of the vote or the number of yes 
and no votes in uzbekistan in central asia 
the first no votes in any soviet legislature came at the end 
of october when 31 of 1500 deputies in the supreme soviet voted 
against two government decrees limiting demonstrations 
the uzbek supreme soviet rejected the republic leaderships 
budget for 1989 saying it underestimated the production capacity of 
governmentowned industry by hundreds of millions of rubles tass 
said 
the uzbek legislators found unreasonably low plan targets for 
many industries tass reported after calling various industry 
ministers to committee meetings it worked out an entirely new 
budget that increased industrial output by 477 million 
the agricultural plan was boosted by 272 million tass said 
the deputies shifted tens of millions of dollars from 
construction of new industry to housing in extremely short supply 
throughout the soviet union schools and hospitals tass said 
funding also rose for social and ecological programs it said 
legislators found that uzbek industry could make up for the lost 
funding through better management advanced technology and support 
for initiative tass said 
these same deputies previously read a draft plan on the eve of 
the session discussed it quickly and formally at the session and 
unanimously approved it tass said 
they invariably counted on the republics council of ministers 
to correct possible mistakes the news agency said 
the uzbek legislature now has 12 committees working between 
sessions to solve political social and economic problems tass 
said quoting the legislatures president pulat khabibullaev 
many uzbek leaders have been arrested in the past year in a 
corruption scandal in which among other things conspirators 
underreported cotton production and kept the difference 
the criminals covered themselves with a network of bribes that 
allegedly reached even to a former soviet interior minister who has 
since committed suicide his deputy yuri churbanov the soninlaw 
of the late soviet leader leonid brezhnev is awaiting a verdict in 
his bribery trial in the past month the alleged reform leader of 
the uzbek communist party also has been arrested

the oncebanned songs by a soldier about his 
experiences in the afghan war will be published by the red army and 
recorded on the staterun record label the communist party 
newspaper said tuesday 
in an article marking the ninth anniversary of soviet 
intervention in afghanistan pravda touched on soviet societys 
lingering pain over the continuing war as soviet diplomats seek new 
political solutions 
listening to the songs of yuri kirsanov who served twice in 
afghanstan you again see the face of a dead friend feel the hail 
of stones from a nearby explosion suffer smile and cry wrote 
pravda correspondent v verstakov 
he recalled how when he returned from his first trip to 
afghanistan soviet customs agents listened for kirsanovs songs on 
any tapes 
he quoted one officer as telling kirasanov judging by your 
songs you dont believe in anything 
nevertheless the singer and his songs remain widely popular 
among afghan veterans many soviets believe he died in action 
pravda said it found kirsanov 37 in the city of zhdanov and 
that he told the paper he had believed in the possibility of 
bringing peace to afghanistan we believed in that honestly 
thats why i sang he said 
in one of kirsanovs songs a girl says to soviet soldiers 
youre searching for minutes of happiness but i know in the 
mountains the rebels sit sharpening their knives against russians 
pravda did not say when it found kirsanov 
at the military publishers a collection the times chose us is 
being prepared in which they are publishing for the first time not 
only the words but the music to kirsanovs songs pravda said 
it said the staterun record label melodiya was preparing a 
record of kirsanovs songs for release toward theend of the soviet 
withdrawal from afghanistan 
the ninth anniversary of soviet intervention in afghanistan comes 
at the end of a year in which the soviets withdrew half of their 
estimated 100000 soldiers there forces of the prosoviet afghan 
army remained under heavy pressure from antimarxist rebels 
tass said two people were killed tuesday in rebel attacks on the 
northern city of kunduz and on the capital kabul it said the 
shelling of kabul was the first in a month and a half 
according to a unbrokered agreement signed in april all 
soviet troops are to be completely withdrawn from afghanistan by 
feb 15 moscow halted the withdrawal in the fall citing continued 
us and pakistani aid to the afghan rebels 
president mikhail s gorbachev proposed in a speech at the united 
nations dec 7 that a ceasefire be imposed on jan 1 and all 
military supplies to the country be cut off 
soviet officials this month also met facetoface with leaders of 
the afghan opposition and with exiled afghan king zaher shah to 
discuss a plan for convening a council of 50 to 60 politicians or 
prominent figures to create a new government 
soviet soldiers entered afghanistan on dec 27 1979 replaced 
one prosoviet government with another and remained on to fight the 
insurgents 
military officials said earlier this year that more than 13000 
soviet soldiers had died in afghanistan and that more than 35000 
had been wounded 
those who have returned have faced the indifference of many 
soviets and a bewildering array of problems in getting benefits to 
which they are entitled by law 
the war is among the most popular topics for young soviets who 
gather in parks to sing or listen to amateur musicians 
the pravda article tuesday echoed a passionate article in the 
youth newspaper komsomolskaya pravda dec 21 that cited letters from 
afghan veterans and their families 
that article said the time was coming to bring to light documents 
revealing how officials made the decision to send soldiers to 
afghanistan 
we will find out not only about the bravery of our lads about 
successful operations but also possibly about the failures of 
experts or diplomats the newspaper said 
afghanistan like an open wound will pain the spirit yet for 
many years it said

troops raiding a west bank village shot and 
killed a 25yearold palestinian on tuesday and another 19 were 
wounded by army gunfire in other clashes in the occupied lands arab 
hospital officials said 
an army official said troops wounded only 10 palestinians he 
confirmed the raid in abwein village but said officials still were 
investigating reports of the death 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said he would renew his contacts 
with palestinian leaders in the occupied lands calling them 
israels partners for negotiating a peace settlement 
we favor a dialogue between us and the residents of the 
territories rabin told israel television he reiterated that the 
government would not negotiate with the palestine liberation 
organization which israel calls a terrorist organization 
during the abwein raid troops clashed with stonethrowing 
villagers and at one point opened fire the army official said 
later the army received reports from nearby ramallah hospital 
that villager mohammed omar ahmed khalil died of gunshot wounds he 
said 
the army was unable to confirm the cause of death because 
relatives took the body from the hospital the official said 
a ramallah hospital official said khalil was shot in the shoulder 
and lung and died after arriving at the hospital 
speaking on condition of anonymity the official quoted khalils 
relatives as saying the man was in a village store when a group of 
soldiers burst inside and opened fire

free judea in the occupied west bank israel radio said 
the council for free judea said monday it would declare an 
independent state jan 18 to press demands for israeli annexation of 
the occupied lands 
this is not a revolt but a strong gesture of no confidence in 
the israeli government group leader rabbi michael benhorin an 
army reserve captain told israel radio on monday 
in another development six gaza strip palestinians facing 
deportation withdrew their supreme court appeals four of the men 
face immediate expulsion 
the two others struck a deal they promised to stay away from 
israel and the occupied territories for five years and then be 
allowed to return on condition they refrain from antiisraeli 
activities during their exile 
since the uprising began 36 palestinians have been deported by 
israel and a total of 24 face expulsion the united states and other 
western nations have condemned deportations as a violation of 
international human rights conventions

leading cultural and academic figures tuesday 
accused the culture ministry of coopting their plans for nationwide 
memorials to victims of stalin with a halfhearted design 
competition limited to the soviet capital 
i think this is an effort after so many victims to shake off 
the historical memory with the help of one or another stone or 
bronze monument said poet yevgeny yevtushenko this appears to 
be a blow against our organizations as a whole 
writer yuri karyakin said he saw an extraordinarily dangerous 
symptom of continued government monopoly over social activity 
despite president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms revolution from 
above needs support from below he said 
yevtushenko karyakin historian yuri afanasyev magazine editor 
vitaly korotich and other figures in the forefront of gorbachevs 
reform effort spoke at a news conference sponsored by the memorial 
society 
founders of the group of lesserknown activists began collecting 
signatures late last year demanding a memorial to victims of 
dictator josef stalins repression they were repeatedly arrested 
and fined until they gained official support this year 
in july gorbachev himself spoke out in favor of the project it 
is of vital interest in a society still coming to grips with the 
millions of deaths that occurred during stalins 19241953 rule 
many soviets have relatives who were killed or sent to prison camps 
in that time 
in late november memorial sponsored an unofficial week of 
conscience and displayed proposals for a memorial complex 
but the ministry of culture in a tuesday announcement in the 
newspaper soviet culture revealed plans for a competition to design 
a monument that excluded memorial 
sponsors listed included only officially recognized organizations 
such as artistic unions and the moscow city government memorial is 
an informal organization that has scheduled its founding conference 
for the end of january 
the ministry project calls for construction of a single monument 
in moscow but memorial has called for establishment of a more 
comprehensive center to educate people about stalins terror through 
the use of archives and other historical materials more than 100 
local memorial groups are pushing for similar projects in cities 
throughout the soviet union 
the monument will be built in moscow nothing is said about any 
other place whats actually happening we have to think about the 
whole country all the republics suffered yevtushenko said 
in another development tuesday officials said nobel peace prize 
winner and human rights activist andrei d sakharov is being 
considered for a new congress of peoples deputies a national 
parliamentary body of 2250 people that for the first time will 
include representatives from political and social organizations as 
well as those elected by geographic districts 
nominations for the march 26 elections began monday 
officials said a monday meeting at the institute of the world 
economy nominated sakharov for consideration at the next level a 
meeting of the academy of sciences

their former jobs will be given training for new jobs and continue 
to receive their former wages for six months tass said 
recovery of dead bodies is nearing an end with an estimated 400 
remaining to pulled out shcherbina told tass rescuers found 8000 
survivors under the rubble in leninakan and 10800 corpses he said 
authorities plan to start rebuilding the city with satellite 
residential areas shcherbina said 
however thousands of tons of supplies pouring into the disaster 
area are piling up on railroad tracks because authorities have been 
unable to unload rail cars as quickly as they arrive izvestia said 
on dec 25 1800 rail cars full of relief supplies arrived in 
armenia but only 1423 were unloaded the newspaper said 
sundays snowstorm closed roads into the area and izvestia said 
disorganization worsened the situation no one spread sand or salt 
on the roads and no one cleared the snow from the worst sections of 
the twisting mountain highways it said 
soviet authorities have come under considerable criticism for 
lack of organization in the quake relief efforts but many of the 
areas leaders died or wandered in shock for days after crawling out 
of the rubble to find their families gone 
soviet tv broadcast a special program on the earthquake tuesday 
night that emphasized the aid pouring into armenia from across the 
soviet union and the world 
the cameras focused on the haunted eyes of children a woman 
crying over the corpse of a man and long low aerial footage of

a police academy class whose first week of 
training resulted in the death of one cadet and the hospitalization 
of 14 others graduates wednesday but a dispute lingers over who 
will pay their medical bills 
the state has agreed to cover the costs of the cadet who died 
but has balked at covering what some estimate are up to 500000 in 
bills resulting from the illness of the other 14 town and city 
officials maintain the state should pay since it ran the training 
program 
an investigation into the november death of cadet timothy shepard 
of complications from heat stroke resulted in a reform of the school 
and its strict training methods 
the state offered to pay for the 250000 liver transplant that 
shepard of pittsfield underwent a week after his sept 19 
collapse but michael lelyveld spokesman for state secretary of 
administration and finance frank keefe said the state has not made 
a specific policy for reimbursement for the other cadets 
the institute has undergone a major overhaul since nearly 
onethird of the class of 50 was hospitalized for dehydration and 
exhaustion in addtion several cadets received further treatment 
for and muscle damage they suffered from their first week at the 
school in september 
the head of the agency has resigned and several other top 
staffers have left recommendations from a board of experts 
appointed by gov michael s dukakis to reshape the criminal justice 
training center are expected in the next few weeks 
i do not expect in any way shape or form that the propertytax 
payers of chicopee should have to pay for this mayor joseph 
chessey said of the estimated 30000 cost of treating two city 
cadets we sent our recruits there in good shape i feel it is a 
problem of the state and not the city 
earlier this month state sen peter webber filed a bill that 
would reimburse cities and towns for costs not covered by insurance

the state department marking the ninth 
anniversary of the soviet military move into afghanistan predicted 
tuesday that the afghan army would fall apart after the soviet 
troops were withdrawn 
despite the introduction of backfire bombers and other new 
weapons by the soviets the usarmed resistance made sizable gains 
throughout the year the anniversary report said 
as a result the afghan army is a demoralized force suffering 
shortages of qualified officers and manpower despite forced 
conscriptions and bribes of tribal militia the report said most 
experts agree that it probably can survive no more than a matter of 
months after a complete soviet withdrawal 
the soviets had an estimated 110000 to 115000 troops in the 
country supporting a promoscow government against rebels armed by 
the united states through pakistan 
half the troops were withdrawn by midaugust in compliance with 
an accord signed last april by afghanistan and pakistan and the 
remaining half is supposed to leave by next feb 15 
meanwhile president reagan repeated in a statement issued during 
his california vacation that he expected the soviets to adhere to 
that commitment despite their suspension of the withdrawal early 
last month 
still reagans statement said the introduction of new 
weapons and the escalation in the use of soviet warplanes in 
bombing raids against afghanistan call into question the soviet 
commitment to a peaceful solution 
in a reversal of policy soviet deputy foreign minister yuli 
vorontsov met this month in taif saudi arabia with burhanuddin 
rabbani chairman of an alliance of afghan rebels 
the meeting was held over the strong objections of the kabul 
government which feared the soviets might reach an independent 
agreement with the rebels the report said 
the soviets now appear ready to explore all options that could 
lead to a political settlement the report said without 
elaboration 
it disclosed that the soviets had held unpublicized meetings in 
europe with representatives of a rebel group before the taif talks 
at least 300 soviet troops are missing in action and some may be 
held by the rebels the report said 
the main decision reached so far in the talks between vorontsov 
and the guerrilla leaders was to continue the meetings and we are 
expecting a followup any day now robert flaten head of the state 
departments office of afghan affairs told reporters tuesday 
the united states supports meetings between the afghan resistance 
and the soviets in the hope that it will lead to an agreement that 
could save lots of lives flaten said 
the taif talks were followed by a significant reduction in the 
intensity of guerrilla activity with fewer attacks against 
cities but for inexplicable reasons the soviets have not 
responded and have continued the war at a brutal level with 
attacks by the recently introduced backfire bombers he said 
top officials of the communist government in kabul may eventually 
leave the country flaten said in answer to questions 
after nine years of fighting the afghan people can identify 
the people they consider to have sold out their country whom 
they consider traitors criminals war criminals or whatever and 
will deal with them flaten said 
but this will affect a fairly thin level of senior people 
the average guy working in a ministry is not threatened he 
continued

opposition legislators tuesday questioned the 
legality of sending mexico city police commandos to crush a prison 
riot 500 miles away and a congressional committee was assigned to 
investigate 
at least five inmates may have been killed after surrendering at 
the end of a twoday uprising at venustiano carranza penitentiary in 
nayarit province twenty other people also died in the riot 
this is not called crimefighting this is called criminal 
government that does not observe the law federico ruiz lopez of 
the opposition conservative national action party shouted during 
heated debate in the chamber of deputies 
the chamber passed by acclamation a resolution to have its 
justice and government committee investigate whether the decision by 
nayarit gov celso humberto delgado ramirez to call in the commandos 
was warranted 
during the debate opposition legislators said the very existence 
of the special commando units was unconstitutional because no law 
authorizes them 
deputy salvador sanchez vasquez said the decision by the 
governor a fellow member of the ruling institutional revolutionary 
party was legal and covered by a police cooperation and extradition 
agreement among mexicos 31 states and the federal district 
government 
nayarit deputy ernesto rivera of the opposition popular socialist 
party supported the governor 
it was a scandal for nayarit but i feel he handled it in the 
most intelligent manner possible rivera said in a telephone 
interview sometimes it is necessary to use these types of 
instruments to return control to the state 
nayarit attorney general rodolfo leon announced in tepic the 
state capital that he was launching an investigation into the 
deaths of the five inmates 
efforts to reach delgado ramirez on tuesday who was in mexico 
city meeting with federal officials were unsuccessful but his 
spokesman in tepic francisco flores said the governor had the 
approval of the state legislature to bring in the special forces 
the governor said from the very beginning that the the 
fundamental goal was to rescue the hostages alive and that goal was 
accomplished flores said there was no other option 
the uprising began dec 22 when a small group of inmates angry 
because they were denied christmas pardons for good behavior 
stormed the wardens office and took 19 people hostage 
warden samuel alvarado was shot in the leg and bled to death 
the fox and scorpion special commando teams flew in from mexico 
city the following day fox team commander juan armando duarte 
badillo was shot and killed when he tried to talk the mutineers into 
surrendering 
state officials at first said police squads stormed the 
penitentiary with tear gas and gunfire twice on friday night and 19 
prisoners died in the two gunfights 
but after the associated press reported that a television 
videotape showed 13 prisoners being questioned about their 
identities by armed policemen officials admitted there was only one 
assault 
on the videotape five of the prisoners could be heard giving 
their names and all five names appeared on a list of dead released a 
few hours later by the governors office 
the five were benjamin gambero anzaldo jose luis parra leyva 
arturo torres casillas ricardo hermosillo guzman and enedino de la 
cruz simon 
witnesses confirmed to reporters that a number of inmates listed 
dead had surrendered to police some witnesses said that after the 
riot had been over for several hours they heard shots in a part of 
the prison where some inmates later were found dead 
flores and other state officials at first said they had no 
knowledge of the discrepancy and could not explain how the prisoners 
could have died in custody a sixth inmate jose martinez palafox 
was listed as dead but identified as having been captured alive by 
freed hostage patricia castillo 
another freed hostage brenda margarita rubio said inmates had 
surrendered castillo and rubio are clerks in the penitentiary

officials on tuesday reviewed the 
investigation into the killing of a black man by a white police 
officer but a civil rights activist wants an independent probe to 
make sure there is no coverup 
michael d moore 27 was shot to death friday night by rookie 
officer james marble 32 during a scuffle outside a convenience 
store authorities said the officer reported seeing moore through 
the stores front windows trying to stuff merchandise into his 
pants police said a fight broke out when the officer confronted 
moore 
police chief walter tucker said tuesday the departments 
investigation into the shooting was complete and that the findings 
had been submitted to a review board consisting of himself two 
shift commanders two detectives two city prosecutors and the 
citys equal employment opportunity officer 
tucker said the boards goal was to determine the facts of the 
case and not to assign responsibility he said the panels findings 
would be turned over to mayor jimmy kemp for further action 
obie clark president of the meridian chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people said he had 
little faith in the investigation and the review board 
we can just about predict what they are going to do theyve 
been covering stuff up he said 
but stewart murphy spokesman for the fbi in jackson said no 
request had been made of the fbi to investigate the shooting he 
declined to speculate on whether the fbi would get involved later 
in the past federal officers have become involved when a 
shooting involves possible civil rights violations 
witnesses reportedly told police that moore aggressively 
assaulted marble to avoid being arrested he was not armed however 
the reports said police accounts said marble an officer for 10 
months fired his service revolver at moore hitting him in the 
chest 
a meridian radio station reported that moore had been shot three 
times lauderdale county coroner marl cobler said however that the 
results of an autopsy performed saturday were not being released 
moore initially was to go to matty hersee hospital a 
statesupported charity facility when the ambulance crew was told 
by radio that no physician was available there the ambulance 
changed direction and went to riley memorial hospital a private 
facility moore died less than two hours after the shooting police 
said 
kemp said marble had been placed on administrative duty until the 
review board completes its work and makes its recommendations 
the mayor said the city would cooperate in any independent 
investigation of the shooting wed be more than glad to furnish 
them with any information he said

two nations virtually cut diplomatic ties in 1987 
nicholas nicola smiled as he walked down the steps of a scheduled 
iran air flight at londons heathrow airport he did not speak to 
reporters and was taken away in a car by his father who met him 
with foreign office officials 
we were absolutely taken by surprise said a foreign office 
spokesman who asked not to be identified were pleased and we 
look forward to the same thing happening with roger cooper 
however there was no word on the possible release of cooper a 
businessman who speaks fluent farsi and has lived in iran for more 
than 20 years 
in what appears to be a more complex case cooper 52 has been 
accused of spying a charge not levied at nicola 
iranian officials say nicola a 23yearold tourist traveling by 
land from pakistan was arrested on the iranian border with firearms 
in september 1986 some iranian reports say he shot at lights at an 
iranian border post 
britain said nicola was held without trial in tehrans maximum 
security evin prison where cooper also is jailed 
but the englishlanguage tehran times reported tuesday that 
nicola was tried and sentenced to a 3year prison term for the 
possession of two weapons and a number of cartridges it said the 
sentence was reduced for good behavior 
nicola was handed over monday to british charge daffaires gordon 
pirie who reopened the british embassy on dec 9 
the family was very pleased to have him back and they were very 
emotional about it his uncle avraam christou said in a british 
broadcasting corp television interview 
britain withdrew all its diplomats in tehran and only one iranian 
envoy remained in london after a dispute which began when british 
police arrested an iranian envoy on shoplifting charges may 1987 
iranian revolutionary guards then kidnapped and beat up a british 
diplomat 
britain has accused iran of breaching the vienna convention by 
allowing only one visit by a british diplomat to nicola and cooper 
improved angloiranian relations have raised modest hopes for 
british hostages believed held in lebanon by proiranian extremists 
anglican church envoy terry waite 49 disappeared jan 20 1987 
while seeking the release of american hostages in lebanon and 
journalist john mccarthy 32 was abducted april 17 1986

thousands of turbaned afghans piled 
into buses in this frontier city at the foot of khyber pass and 
drove to a protest rally tuesday on the ninth anniversary of soviet 
military intervention in afghanistan 
this year only one of seven top afghan guerrilla leaders based 
in pakistan spoke at what may be the last such rally after a decade 
of war 
the rally coincided with increased soviet diplomatic efforts for 
a political settlement of the conflict 
gulbaddin hekmatyar the most radical rebel chief addressed the 
rally at a big refugee camp on the outskirts of peshawar 30 miles 
from the afghan border the antimarxist rebels have demonstrated 
each year on dec 27 the date in 1979 that the red army marched 
into afghanistan at the invitation of the communist government in 
kabul 
more than 3 million afghan war refugees live in pakistan and up 
to 2 million in iran 
burhanuddin rabbani chairman of the sevenparty afghan guerrilla 
alliance supported by washington and based in pakistan met tuesday 
in the iranian capital tehran with government officials and afghan 
rebels 
the guerrillas known as mujahedeen or holy warriors are split 
into two coalitions the iranbased shiite moslem alliance and 
rabbanis larger sunni moslem alliance based in pakistan 
irans official islamic republic news agency quoted the 
englishlanguage newspaper tehran times on tuesday as reporting that 
soviet deputy foreign minister yuli vorontsov will fly to tehran 
soon to meet shiite resistance leaders it will be the first direct 
contact between moscow and the iranbased mujahedeen since the 1979 
soviet intervention 
rabbani was in iran to ensure that both coalitions present a 
united front to moscow 
also tuesday radio kabul said in a broadcast monitored in 
pakistan that guerrilla rocket attacks on afghan cities over the 
previous two days killed at least 28 people the staterun radio 
said herat in western afghanistan was hardest hit with 20 people 
killed four injured there was no independent confirmation 
at the pakistan rally hekmatyar directed his rhetoric at his 
american backers as well as the soviet union though pakistani and 
western sources say he is one of the largest recipients of us 
military aid to afghan rebels hekmatyar refused to acknowledge 
military assistance from washington 
he said his weapons were captured in battle a contention other 
guerrilla leaders deny 
the hardliner also declared it seems that moscow is reaching 
an understanding with the west on one hand in a bid to prevent a 
mujahedeen government in afghanistan 
his speech was punctuated with audience shouts of death to 
russia and death to america 
many demonstrators belonged to hekmatyars fundamentalist 
hezbeislami group a sprinkling of representatives from other 
mujahedeen groups attended 
in april moscow agreed to pull more than 100000 soldiers from 
afghanistan by feb 15 next year half of them left by august the 
united nations negotiated the agreement in geneva and it was signed 
by afghanistan and pakistan with the soviet union and the united 
states acting as coguarantors 
the mujahedeen were not party to the accords and the soviets 
suspended their withdrawal in the face of continuing rebel attacks 
at the beginning of december vorontsov met rabbani in taif 
saudi arabia for negotiations 
rabbani said earlier that vorontsov hinted that afghanistans 
marxist president najib who goes by one name only and his peoples 
democratic party would be sacrificed for a political settlement of 
the war 
hekmatyar has greeted the talks with skepticism he said tuesday 
although these talks are a great political victory for the 
mujahedeen great hopes should not be pinned on such talks 
he assailed a saturday meeting between vorontsov and former king 
zahir shah of afghanistan who has lived in exile in rome since he 
was ousted in a 1973 coup 
moderate afghan rebel groups have supported the kings return to 
head an interim government to be replaced in time by an elected 
parliament 
hekmatyar also dismissed soviet president mikhail gorbachevs 
call for an international conference on afghanistan a ceasefire 
and un peacekeeping troops the mujahedeen unanimously oppose the

a group of 104 nicaraguans who were 
held prisoner in honduras by antisandinista guerrillas were rescued 
and put under protection of the un high commission for refugees a 
honduran official said tuesday 
foreign ministry spokesman eugenio castro told the associated 
press the 96 men and eight women now were in a refugee camp in 
eastern el paraiso province near the nicaraguan border they 
included some soldiers from the sandinista army he said in an 
interview 
all were held illegally in honduran territory by the nicaraguan 
resistance castro said 
the nicaraguan resistance is a coalition of ussupported groups 
of rebels known as contras fighting the past eight years to 
overthrow nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
castro said the nicaraguans were rescued in an action by our 
government which will not permit this kind of illegal capture by 
armed insurgent groups inside honduras he did not say when they 
were freed 
a contra leader who uses the name cmdr johnson said the 
nicaraguans were simply released 
the contras operated with the tacit acceptance of honduras for 
many years but us support for the contras has dwindled and 
hondurans in border areas have increasingly been protesting the 
rebels presence 
thousands of armed guerrillas have fled nicaragua in the past 
year and the honduran government has asked for help in dealing with 
them and with tens of thousands of other nicaraguan refugees 
the contra leader said in an interview the nicaraguans were 
captured in battle by the contras more than a year ago 
he said that with the release the nicaraguan resistance holds no 
more prisoners and that all those who want to return to nicaragua 
will be helped to do so and turned over to the nicaraguan red 
cross 
castro appeared skeptical 
we do not know yet if the contras hold more prisoners in our 
territory this is being investigated by our authorities but if 
there are they will be rescued since we demand respect for the 
sovereignty and laws of honduras he said

a boeing 727 forced to land after a 
14inch hole opened in its fuselage had problems maintaining cabin 
pressure during the flight even before the roof ripped open federal 
officials said tuesday 
the crew of eastern airlines flight 251 told investigators they 
began having trouble shortly after takeoff monday from rochester 
ny en route to atlanta said national transportation safety board 
spokesman ted lopatkiewicz 
by the time they reached 31000 feet they were able to 
stabilize the pressure lopatkiewicz said they sent the second 
officer back to check the doors to listen for problems sometime 
when theres a problem with the door seals you can usually hear it 
but he didnt hear anything 
shortly after he returned there was the rapid 
depressurization 
the plane with 104 passengers and six crew members landed at 
charlestons yeager airport after the roof tore open at 31000 feet 
two passengers were treated at a hospital for nosebleeds and 
headaches caused by the sudden loss of pressure 
on tuesday a fort lauderdale flabound eastern airlines jet 
returned to new york citys laguardia airport to repair a loose door 
panel that kept the cabin from pressurizing properly an airline 
spokeswoman said 
flight 715 an a300 airbus carrying 210 passengers took off at 
845 am and returned to the airport at 1005 am to have the 
access door panel repaired said virginia sanchez 
also tuesday eastern mechanics inspected 17 of the 100 series 
727s and 28 of the 200 series 727s airline officials said 
its just as a precautionary measure following yesterdays 
incident said spokeswoman karen ceremsak 
as federal investigators began the monthslong job of pinpointing 
the cause of mondays incident they also said tuesday that 
records for the past five years show the plane had made seven 
unscheduled landings before this week but none could be called an 
emergency landing 
the section of the fuselage that developed the hole was a 
replacement part not the original skin of the plane which is about 
20 years old 
the piece that peeled away would be taken to a laboratory for 
metallurgical tests 
the plane was 50 miles or a few minutes flying time from 
charleston when the hole opened passengers said they heard a pop 
and felt a cold wind whipping through the cabin before oxygen masks 
dropped down before them 
the crew took the plane down to 10000 feet the altitude at 
which oxygen masks arent needed before landing 
two ntsb representatives from washington were in charleston on 
tuesday to examine the plane it could be six months before a final 
determination is made on what happened said ntsb investigator 
pamela kleckner 
interviews with flight attendants revealed that the 21000foot 
drop took no more than 90 seconds kleckner said 
they said they were amazed and how quick it was between the 
time the oxygen masks came down and the time the captain said people 
could breathe normally kleckner said 
kleckner said the agency will test the torn piece of metal 
itll go back to our laboratory in washington our metallurgical 
lab and theyll use an electron microscope to pinpoint the type 
of failures on the metal itself she said 
kleckner said the ntsb also will look into complaints by some 
passengers that their oxygen masks did not work 
a 5inch crack had been found on the fuselage of the plane in an 
inspection in july 1986 and corrosion and a tiny wing crack were 
found in april 1987 said bobbie mardis of the faas safety data 
branch in oklahoma city 
federal officials also said mechanical problems including 
failure to maintain cabin pressure had forced the jet to land at 
least seven times in the past five years 
but ceremsak said from what i understand from what theyve 
pulled up on this plane theres nothing unusual in its history 
ceremsak said the jet was maintained according to faa guidelines 
and its crown the top of the fuselage from the cockpit to the tail 
was inspected in september 
mardis said tuesday that it was not unusual for a plane to 
develop cracks like those on the 727 
inspectors do periodic inspections and cracks are one of the 
items they look for she said its part of normal wear and 
tear and we know thats going to happen that doesnt mean theyre 
not serious but thats why they look for them 
lopatkiewicz said investigators determined that the section that 
peeled away had been replaced but they did not know whether it was 
because of cracks 
i suppose its possible but we dont have any information on 
the maintenance and the timing on when things had been done he 
said 
faa officials in atlanta said ntsb officials has custody of all 
maintenance records including the september inspection report 
lopatkiewicz said the agency hasnt received the records 
richard maddan manager of the faa office in charleston said he 
didnt think there was any connection between the planes previous 
problems and the tear on monday 
from the preliminary information i dont think it would be the 
same as the corrosion or the rivet problems maddan said the 
information i got is that its just a hole

a group identifying itself as a 
new rightwing death squad has vowed to exact eyeforaneye revenge 
for killings and car bombings by leftists according to a communique 
the only way to achieve the total extermination of this horde 
of terrorist killers is by the same means and with the same force 
they use said the communique issued by a group calling itself the 
revolutionary anticommunist exterminating action or arde 
the communique was delivered to media outlets over the weekend 
and several radio stations began broadcasting it tuesday 
in the early 1980s death squads regularly issued communiques 
threatening individuals or leftist groups and those threats were 
frequently carried out the last such communique was issued in june 
1987 
the group threatened to kill two leftist leaders for each person 
the guerrillas kidnap or kill to bomb the house of one leftist 
leader for every car bomb and to kill one leftist for each mayor 
forced to resign under death threats from leftist guerrillas 
it also accused the military of being unable to stop the 
terrorist actions of these vandals 
the farabundo marti national liberation front a coalition of 
five leftist guerrilla groups that have been fighting the government 
since 1979 has set off several car bombs in san salvador in recent 
months 
on friday guerrillas attacked the defense ministry headquarters 
compound on the edge of the capital with four car bombs and 
explosives killing four people and wounding 35 
the same day unidentified terrorists attacked the national 
university which rightists have often accused of being a center of 
leftist activity a night watchman was killed and the biology lab 
building was blown up in the attack 
guerrillas have forced 18 mayors from small provincial towns to 
resign during the past three months with death threats 
the arde communique was dated dec 21 and was delivered by hand 
to five newspapers and four television and six radio stations it 
said the media would be attacked drastically if they did not 
publish the communique for three consecutive days 
the communique contained a list of leftist leaders headed by top 
liberation front commanders shafick handal and ferman cienfuegos 
who it said would be killed in reprisals 
it also listed among possible victims guillermo ungo a candidate 
in presidential elections next march for the leftist democratic 
convergence coalition and ruben zamora his campaign coordinator 
both belong to the democratic revolutionary front a nonfighting 
coalition of leftist parties movements and student and labor unions 
closely allied with the liberation front 
zamora who returned to el salvador in november 1987 after seven 
years of exile said in a telephone interview that the threats 
show that ultrarightist sectors are desperate because we are on 
the right electoral path and we will not retreat in the face of 
threats and blackmail 
an estimated 65500 people have been killed since guerrillas 
launched a civil war in 1979 against a succession of ussupported 
governments human rights groups say most of the victims have been 
civilians slain by leftist or rightist death squads 
rightist death squads organized or tolerated by the military 
were blamed for thousands of slayings from 1980 to early 1984 
the slayings abated in july 1984 when president jose napoleon 
duartes centrist christian democratic administration took office 
after the first free elections in el salvador and forced the 
military to sever all ties with the rightist squads

the government plans to end gasoline 
rationing on jan 1 the official news agency pap said tuesday and 
state car manufacturers announced new car prices 
pap said state authorities took those steps in an effort to 
ensure a balance between market supply and demand 
the agency said gasoline under the new system will cost about 
146 a gallon and diesel fuel about 1 a gallon 
poles now receive monthly gasoline ration cards based on the size 
of their automobile this entitles them to purchase a limited amount 
of fuel at the official price of approximately 91 cents a gallon 
since june they also have been allowed to buy gas at a 
commercial price of about 250 a gallon introduction of a 
uniform price eliminates commercial gasoline 
this summer poles flocked to gas stations to fill up with 
nonrationed gasoline despite the higher price 
a ministry of industry official cautioned that prices will rise 
if gasoline sales at the new price outstrip demand pap said 
the average monthly wage in poland is about 144 
pap issued a partial list of official prices to go into effect 
wednesday for the most popular cars produced in poland the small 
fiat 126p will cost 3600 and the fourdoor polonez 14000 
in practice however it is very difficult for poles to obtain 
cars at the official price cars must be bought either for dollars 
or at a much higher price in zlotys 
because of high demand people able to buy a car at the official 
rate often resell it on the open market for double or triple what 
they paid 
on the political front 11 representatives of five banned polish 
opposition groups began a weeklong hunger strike on christmas day to 
protest the detention of peace activists in poland and 
czechoslovakia jacek szymanderski a spokesman for the group said 
tuesday 
the hunger strikers accuse authorities of pursuing a policy of 
reconciliation with society in an atmosphere of repression a 
communique released by szymanderski said 
fasters include members of the independent peace group freedom 
and peace supporters of the outlawed free trade union movement 
solidarity the independent students union the polish socialist 
party and polishczechoslovak solidarity

residents are hoping the national 
attention presidentelect bushs hunting trip has brought this south 
texas town in the heart of cowboy country will translate into 
economic gains 
we are on hard times said jeff latcham general manager of 
the semiweekly beeville beepicayune in this sleepy town of about 
15000 some 20 miles from the lazy f ranch where bush is hunting 
quail 
ever since president reagan the economy went down said 
alex acosda owner of the bee club bar and lounge its terrible 
the bee club one of several downtown saloons is just off the 
main street near an a boardedup art deco movie theater a pharmacy 
and at least two western stores that sell cowboy boots and hats 
like other texas towns beeville and surrounding bee county have 
been hit hard in the 1980s by flat oil and natural gas prices 
agriculture and ranching are other mainstays of the economy 
joe d montez the city manager who is constantly trying to 
rustle up new business for his native town wished aloud that the 
bush visit might bring a shotgun factory here they could say 
this is where bush hunts 
he conceded that possbility was remote but added the more 
national exposure you get who knows 
although bush has hunted at the lazy f ranch owned by houston 
millionaire will farish for two decades he has never visited 
beeville on the annual postchristmas excursion residents say 
it was no different this trip 
bush who joked that beeville was a swinging place remained 
secluded for a second day tuesday on the 10000acre ranch with the 
farishs and james a baker iii his close friend and designated 
secretary of state he has no public appearances scheduled until he 
leaves thursday for a fishing trip in alabama 
bush spokesman steve hart said the presidentelect didnt 
strike out on his first hunt monday conditions were less than 
perfect tuesday with gusting winds but hart said the vice president 
again had success in the scrubland although the spokesman did not 
know how many birds he killed 
while bush was isolated montez and others said the presence of 
more than 40 journalists accompanying bush focused the spotlight on 
beeville 
its good for public relations said jimmy waller a truck 
driver we filled up the hotels 
one of them the best westerndrummers inn on us highway 81 
served as media headquarters 
everytime he comes were booked up said desk clerk sandy 
gilliam 
while the vice president has been a longtime visitor to bee 
county he only won the 1988 presidential contest there by four 
votes latham said 
the countys population is about 50 percent hispanic while the 
percentage is higher in the city that group often votes democratic 
but montez who easily switches between english and spanish said 
he ignored his democratic party allegiance this year and voted for 
bush i think he is good for texas he said 
montez said the town could use some more federal aid which he 
said has been cut dramatically since the 1970s 
unemployment in the city is about 8 percent area officials are 
trying to persuade the state to locate a new prison in the county 
they also want more light industry and manufacturing such as a 
local factory that makes steel waste containers 
the biggest employer is chase naval air station with about 600 
civilian employees the county also has a junior college and a texas 
aampm agricultural research station 
nancy martinez 26 the mother of two children said most people 
who cant find jobs move to the big cities like corpus christi 70 
miles away or go on welfare 
there are no jobs right now she said 
though the economy is not as prosperous as it was in the oil and 
gas boom of the 1970s montez said people in beeville have a unique 
way of life 
were different down here in south texas he said this is

the opposition on tuesday angrily called 
off a planned dialogue with the military government of president 
augusto pinochet after the government vetoed participation by a 
leftist leader 
the first formal dialogue in five years between the opposition 
and the 15yearold government was scheduled for jan 3 to discuss 
constitutional changes demanded by the opposition to speed 
transition to democratic rule 
but the 17party opposition coalition said it cannot accept 
discriminatory measures the government has tried to impose on the 
country it called the governments veto of luis maira a pretext 
to make the scheduled dialogue fail 
interior minister carlos caceres the cabinets chief political 
official said monday he agreed to meet the opposition to discuss 
the proposed changes 
caceres said however he would not accept any fourmember 
delegation named which included maira president of the wide front 
of the socialist left a new umbrella party that includes prominent 
communists among its members 
caceres said he was not ready to talk to a party that includes 
communists and other sectors that openly reject the countrys 
institutionality 
after a threehour meeting tuesday the opposition said we 
have decided to cancel our request to meet interior minister carlos 
caceres 
maira said caceres move was intended to create a problem 
within the opposition 
opposition spokesman patricio aylwin president of the centrist 
christian democratic party said the text of proposed changes was 
mailed to caceres anyway so the government cannot dodge its 
responsibility to give us an answer 
the opposition demanded the changes after gen pinochet lost an 
oct 5 referendum in which he sought voter approval to stay in power 
until 1997 
the defeat forced him to call open presidential and congressional 
elections now set for dec 14 1989

investigators probing the pan am jet 
crash said heat damage on the cargo bays plastic lining was caused 
most probably by an explosion among luggage the london times 
reported wednesday 
the newspaper also said some of the recovered bodies of the 
passengers and crew of the boeing 747 were found to have slivers of 
metal embedded in them 
but it remains to be proved that a bomb caused the damage and 
injuries in the dec 21 crash of flight 103 it said the newspaper 
did not identify the investigators and experts cited 
one investigator indicated that the cargo bay lining was the 
most significant find the newspaper reported it is made of 
kevlar an extremely strong but lightweight polymer compound ideally 
suited to aircraft construction 
the signs of heat damage were clearly evident but it will be 
left to the scientists at the ministry of defenses royal 
armaments research and development establishment at fort halstead in 
kent to prove that the damage was caused by a bomb it said 
tests on a suitcase and wreckage from the plane began tuesday at 
the center britains leading explosives research unit said 
transport department press officer penny russellsmith 
all 259 aboard the jet were killed and 11 lockerbie residents in 
an area where a huge chunk of wreckage fell are missing and presumed 
dead 
the times said more suitcases which had been ripped by metal 
fragments were also recovered tuesday 
experts believe that the damage and injuries are incompatible 
with a catastrophic structural failure of the jet the other 
possible cause of the disaster it said 
the bodies of five americans killed in the crash began the 
journey home tuesday night 
in a biting scottish wind hundreds of residents lined the 
streets of lockerbie to pay silent tribute as a police motorcycle 
led a long white truck slowly through town carrying the five plain 
pine coffins 
the bodies were the first among the crash victims identified and 
released for burial 
an honor guard of pan am flight attendants police soldiers 
us embassy officials and rescue workers stood quietly as the five 
coffins were moved from a warehouse serving as a chapel and placed 
in the truck 
the bodies were to be put on flights from london to the united 
states expected to arrive in new york wednesday afternoon 
some women bowed their heads one man raised a hand in a gesture

the first professional acting work by soap 
opera star ian buchanan for the equalizer on cbs left him 
bruised in tears and wondering if hed made the right move in 
giving up modeling for acting 
buchanans career as a model had taken him on assignment to 
france italy japan and other exotic places he had one of the most 
photographed faces in europe 
currently starring as duke lavery in abcs general hospital 
he was lured to new york from his native scotland first as a model 
but despite the success he wasnt satisfied 
i first started working in the hotel industry he said 
then i discovered there were warmer places than scotland i headed 
for the sun and started modeling in spain modeling sounds better in 
spanish 
when youre a model you travel all over europe you can call 
them a traveling circus or a pack of hyenas you get there first 
and you never tell your best friend theyre hiring models are 
everything people say they are 
he made his career change by enrolling at the new york actors 
studio founded by lee strasberg strasberg died the next day 
he said i hung in for about a year i also studied with marcia 
haufrecht 
his first acting job on the episode of the equalizer was a 
very bumpy ride 
they dragged me down the stairs and killed me he said we 
had no rehearsal the director was in a hurry they threw me into 
the back of a car banged my head and drove off i was not supposed 
to have any dialogue 
they looked at the film and said your lips keep moving i 
kept yelling im not a stunt man i was black and blue i was 
wearing my own shoes when they dragged me they ripped the toes off 
i was in tears but i was in show business no one said it was easy 
i did get to see edward woodward i saw him out of the corner of my 
eye when they threw me in the trunk 
his luck changed when he met gloria monte then executive 
producer of general hospital at that time general hospital 
was going through the roof as televisions supersoap opera 
he auditioned and was quickly hired his role as the adventurous 
and romantic duke lavery was the first time he had dialogue he won 
the soap opera digest soapy award as 1987s best male newcomer 
of the year 
buchanan has been nominated for this years awards as outstanding 
hero the soapies will be presented jan 14 and will be televised on 
nbc on jan 16 
buchanan was interviewed in his hollywood apartment where he was 
recuperating from minor surgery in the meantime general 
hospital suspended production for two weeks to move from the 
sunsetgower studios to a new sound stage at the abc studios 
buchanan joined the show after the luke and laura episodes luke 
spencer anthony geary and laura baldwin genie francis were 
dubbed the rhett butler and scarlett ohara of the soaps both left 
the show not long after their muchballyhooed wedding raised the 
shows audience to record levels the ratings have slipped since 
then but general hospital generally trades first or second 
place with cbs the young and the restless in the most recent 
ratings period it was first 
buchanan was cast because general hospital needed a new hero 
with a shady past and a hint of menace 
i had my own wedding to finola hughes playing anna devane 
he said i was wearing kilts from the mclean clan since my 
grandmother was a mclean pictures of the wedding were sent around 
the world and one ran in color in a newspaper in scotland one of my 
brothers called and said i see you married john travoltas 
girlfriend she had been with him in staying alive i had to 
explain to him that i was just doing a tv show 
duke lavery began as a shady nightclub owner i think every 
picture in the 1940s with joan crawford had a shady nightclub 
owner he said then he fell in love and tried to clean up his 
act but he wasnt clever enough to completely cover his tracks 
he still runs the club but sometimes i forget that on a soap 
you can go for months on end without ever having to go to work 
buchanan has also been appearing as himself on its garry 
shandlings show

the us presidential election and the earthquake that devastated 
soviet armenia killing tens of thousands of people were the top 
two news stories of 1988 in a yearend poll of associated press 
member newspaper editors and broadcasters 
the election story accumulated 1412 points in the annual survey 
the earthquake 1404 
it was a year in which ussoviet relations showed a warming 
trend capped by president mikhail s gorbachevs announcement of a 
substantial unilateral cut in soviet troop strength the start of 
the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan the reagangorbachev summit 
in moscow and the soviet leaders continuing overhaul of the soviet 
system amid nationalist unrest in some soviet republics also made 
big news 
ballots were returned by 106 associated press newspaper editors 
and 126 broadcasters who ranked the years headline events from no 
1 through no 10 a firstplace vote counted 10 points a 10thplace 
vote one point 
the total of 232 was about 200 votes fewer than usual 
latebreaking events had required a revised ballot and second vote 
making earlier ballots outdated 
even so the dec 21 crash of a pan american airways jumbojet on 
a flight from london to new york which killed all 259 aboard and an 
estimated dozen on the ground occurred too late to be included in 
the top10 ranking 
as it has so often in recent decades the mideast again grabbed 
major attention especially with the united states policy reversal 
in opening talks with the palestine liberation organization 
domestically stories on the environment ranked high news 
included the midwestern drought which placed third as well as 
forest fires dirty beaches and even a pair of forlorn whales 
the annual rankings are not conducted as a scientific poll but an 
informal survey the collective view of people who deal with the 
news daily in a nation of diverse regional concerns 
the national election leading the editors ballots was a race 
characterized by what analysts called negative campaigning in 
which prepared tv ads often spoke for the candidates vice 
president george bush and his running mate sen dan quayle of 
indiana and the democratic governor of massachusetts michael 
dukakis and his running mate sen lloyd bentsen of texas 
bush won 40 states and 426 electoral votes dukakis won 10 states 
and the district of columbia and 111 electoral votes the popular 
vote was 54 percent to 46 percent in favor of bush the turnout was 
estimated at slightly more than 50 percent of the votingage 
population the lowest since 1924 
it was not a total rout for the democrats they gained a seat in 
the senate for a 5545 majority and picked up three seats in the 
house to maintain control by 260175 the democrats also managed a 
gain of one governor and now hold 28 of the nations 50 
governorships 
the armenian earthquake ranked second among 1988s news stories 
occurred at 1141 am on dec 7 and by seismic standards was 
not an especially large shock it registered 69 on the richter 
scale as compared for example with mexico citys 81 quake of 1985 
and alaskas 1964 quake of 85 
but the devastation wrought by the armenian quake was staggering 
at least 50000 perished and 500000 were left homeless at years 
end the ultimate number was still unknown even as mexico citys 
10000 deaths remains only a guess three years later the alaska 
quake killed only 114 
the armenian quake leveled entire cities and towns leninakan a 
city of 290000 was 80 percent destroyed two other midsize 
cities kirovakan and stepanavan suffered similarly spitak a city 
of 16000 was effectively wiped out nations east and west 
including the united states responded immediately with offers of 
help for the first time since the lendlease days of world war ii 
the soviets accepted the us offer 
soviet authorities blamed the extent of the destruction partly on 
shoddy construction work during the pregorbachev brezhnev era 
there were allegations that contractors to meet tight schedules in 
an ailing economy had larded their mortar with sand weakening the 
buildings 
nationalist zeal persisted amid the devastation some militant 
armenians claimed that in resettling orphans outside armenia the 
soviets were trying to snatch them from their culture gorbachev 
who cut short a us visit to fly to the stricken area was 
chagrined by the ethnic politics amid such misery and by the soviet 
press criticism of relief efforts as chaotic 
the us drought the no 3 story accumulated 1099 points 
at a time when americas farmers were just beginning to recover 
from the economic crisis of the early 1980s along came the worst 
drought in a halfcentury the worst since the dark dry days of the 
dust bowl so little rain fell on the great plains and elsewhere in 
the midwest that even the mighty mississippi river in june shrunk 
to the point where more than a thousand barges were left stranded 
across the arid countryside the corn harvest fell by 34 percent 
from the previous years bumper crop soybeans by 21 percent spring 
wheat by 54 percent 
relief did not come until august not from rain which was too 
late in most areas but from a 39 billion drought aid bill that 
helped farmers who harvested less than 65 percent of normal 
production by fall the farmers home administration had declared 
1489 counties eligible for emergency disaster loans including 13 
entire states more than onefifth of the nation 
a tragedy in the persian gulf was judged the no 4 news event 
with 901 points 
at 1054 am on july 3 the us warship vincennes under 
assault by iranian gunboats in the persian gulf mistook a civilian 
airliner on a routine flight for an attacking iranian fighter plane 
and shot it down all 290 people aboard the iran air plane perished 
capt will rogers iii of the vincennes called his 12 billion 
vessel the most sophisticated ship in the world bar none and a 
senior naval officer called rogersthe best of the best of the 
best 
a navy board of inquiry found that rogers action was 
understandable in light of the information available it said the 
fog of war and stress of combat may have contributed to the 
tragedy but an international investigatory panel found the navy 
culpable saying its ships should have been monitoring such civilian 
air traffic 
this is a burden i will carry for the rest of my life said 
rogers the united states elected to pay compensation to the 
victims families 
americas reentry into space earned fifth place in the yearend 
poll with 872 points 
space shuttle launches had become routine until the challenger 
explosion killed seven crew members in 1986 consequently when five 
astronauts boarded the shuttle discovery in september it was no 
ordinary mission the future of the us space program rested on its 
success 
one of the astronauts own navy capt robert crippen a veteran 
of four shuttle missions would call go or no go no one 
person had that responsibility before but nasa decided it needed a 
launch czar to avoid the communications failures that 
contributed to the challenger disaster

on the morning of sept 29 crippen consulted with his 21 
advisers experts on all phases of the mission including weather 
observers who were nervous about highaltitude winds above cape 
canaveral and at emergency landing sites around the globe at last 
crippen gave the go 
the result was splendid discovery roared off and the astronauts 
returned to earth four days later after a remarkably smooth flight 
during which they deployed a communications satellite 
two months later a second shuttle atlantis took off on a secret 
defense department mission another success setting the stage for a 
planned sevenflight schedule in 1989 
developments in the mideast ranked in sixth place in 1988 with 
641 points 
after years of maneuverings and hesitations yasser arafat 
finally made it clear enough to satisfy a skeptical united states 
the palestine liberation organization which he heads accepts the 
existence of israel and renounces all forms of terrorism 
and so on dec 14 in a startling reversal of policy president 
reagan announced that the united states would open a substantive 
dialogue with the plo israeli leaders expressed dismay and 
disappointment even though us secretary of state george shultz 
added that the us commitment to the security of israel remains 
unflinching 
the big us turn in the mideast peace process came as israels 
dominant parties the rightofcenter likud and leftofcenter 
labor agreed to form a new coalition government with likuds 
yitzhak shamir as prime minister labor party leader simon peres 
will serve as finance minister 
earlier in the year jordan had cut its administrative ties to 
the israelioccupied west bank where a palestinian uprising ground 
on and the plo had proclaimed a palestinian state it was a 
phantom but an important arab symbol 
the us opening to the plo came ironically after it had 
refused arafat entry to the united states to address the united 
nations the un general assembly thereupon moved temporarily to 
geneva to hear arafat call for negotiations that would include 
israel and the plo that speech failed to meet the us conditions 
but arafats statements at a news conference afterward did 
the end of the iraniraq war scored seventh in the voting with 
544 points after eight years of slaughter in which well over a 
million people and perhaps 2 million were killed or wounded in 
which 13yearold boys died as volunteer sacrificial minesweepers 
in which clouds of poison gas wiped out entire villages in which 
hundreds of billions of dollars were squandered for revenge and 
martyrdom the war between iran and iraq ended in august that grim 
event ranked seventh among the news stories in the ap yearend poll 
after the ceasefire aug 20 the devastated rivals began peace 
talks neither was a victor the two countries need an estimated 
110 billion to rebuild everything from their oil fields to their 
schools with the stress of the battle over hopes rose that iran 
might seek a rapprochement with the united states and terrorism 
might abate in its random search for victims 
the nations environment in its broadest sense ranked eighth in 
the voting with 506 points 
the health of the planet its winds oceans the land itself did 
not fare well in 1988 
the greenhouse effect the development of a blanket of 
carbon dioxide allowing heat to accumulate in the atmosphere was 
at least partly blamed for the drought and other climatic changes 
the use of aerosol containers was pouring a gas into the air that 
was blamed for a hole over the antarctic in the atmospheric shield 
against cancercausing ultraviolet rays a warning some scientists 
said of disaster to come 
meanwhile syringes and other refuse washed ashore on some of the 
nations beaches where the barefoot once waded with impunity 
beaches were closed along the northern atlantic seaboard and the 
public was outraged by the violation of summertime oceanside 
serenity 
gorbachevs dec 7 visit to the united nations ranked ninth in 
the voting with 504 points 
the soviet leader startled the world body along with us 
planners and diplomats by announcing that the soviet union would 
unilaterally reduce its armed forces by 500000 troops along with 
tanks and other equipment news of the armenian earthquake required 
gorbachev to cut short his visit to new york which had welcomed the 
soviet leader warmly and enthusiastically 
in voting the gorbachev announcement no 9 many editors also 
took note of the may 29 reagangorbachev meeting in moscow and of 
gorbachevs june 28 announcement of reforms within the soviet union 
glasnost more openness and perestroika economic 
revamping 
one of the nations worst sieges of forest fires ranked as the 
no 10 news story with 492 points 
the boise interagency fire center which keeps track of the 
nations wildfires said that through the exceptionally dry year 
more than 30000 firefighters battled 72000 blazes that charred 
more than 5 million acres in the united states including 22 
million acres in alaska 
by midjuly a dozen fires raged in the venerable yellowstone 
national park other fires blazed in six surrounding national 
forests 
when november snows finally smothered the yellowstone flames 
706278 acres nearly half of the 22millionacre mother park 
were black and dead 29 buildings were destroyed including 20 at 
the old faithful complex more than 115 million had been spent in 
mostly futile firefighting efforts and the economies of tourist 
towns in three states suffered 
the blazes called into dispute an established wildfire management 
policy that decreed that forest fires caused by people should be 
fought but those touched off by nature should be allowed to burn if 
there were no threat to life or property or historic sites 
at years end that argument still smoldered but fire or no

the end of this week brings a milestone of 
special interest to economywatchers in the united states the last 
government statistical report of 1988 
the numbers due out friday on an index designed to gauge the 
future course of the economy are expected to show ambiguous results 
supporting neither those who think business activity is growing 
too fast nor those who fear an impending recession 
that seems only fitting as the capper on a year in which monthly 
economic statistics became a fixation in the financial markets and 
elsewhere but yielded up no agreement on what the figures all meant 
analysts at the investment firm of smith barney harris upham amp 
co say fridays report on the index of leading economic indicators 
for november will show a modest decline of perhaps 02 percent 
that would follow a small rise in october subject to revision in 
fridays report a decline in september and an increase in august 
plus minus plus minus the official barometer of the economic 
weather is promising something on the order of clear to partly 
cloudy with a chance of rain or snow 
of course the flow of numbers wont stop with the arrival of the 
new year indeed it will be nearly spring before all the last data 
have been gathered on the waning stages of 1988 
by then stock and bond traders business analysts and other 
interested parties will be closely scrutinizing the statistics to 
get a feel for how 1989 has begun 
but if the hue and cry over each individual number will probably 
continue there is the hope at least that people will come to view 
the figures in a more favorable light 
if all else is forgotten 1988 should be remembered as the year 
that all news was bad news said jay donnaruma an analyst at 
first albany corp in albany ny the better the economy did the 
more the markets worried 
what would it take to dispel this seemingly perverse pessimism in 
the months ahead the prescription many analysts offer runs 
something like this 
presidentelect bush makes some decisive proposals to narrow the 
federal budget deficit and gets an unexpectedly upbeat response 
from congress 
economic reports get more consistent and show an unmistakable 
slowing in economic growth to a pace that looks like it can last for 
a long time 
the federal reserve seeing this relaxes its tight grip on the 
reins of credit policy allowing interest rates to decline 
lower rates help the stock market to rally with a vigor not seen 
since before the crash of 1987 
altogether thats a lot to wish for especially without some 
bumps along the way 
the bond market which determines the level of many kinds of 
interest rates swerved up or down a half dozen times in 1988 notes 
maury harris economist at painewebber inc 
in 1989 he says perceptions will undoubtedly continue to 
shift many times but in an anticipated environment of slower 
economic growth 
the statisticswatchers who help create these sudden shifts in 
the perception of the outlook are a muchdespised lot in their 
preoccupation with shortterm numbers it is widely agreed they 
lose sight of the thing that matters most the longterm direction 
of the economy 
still they may serve a useful purpose after all by tradition 
the ultimate threat to economic health is complacency and the 
figurefollowers never sit still long enough to stop worrying

that long zigzag road of trying to achieve 
greater unity among a big swath of american protestantism has passed 
another milestone taking a new route toward the goal 
it no longer intends structural merger as was originally 
contemplated and which has proved the typical bottleneck to unifying 
churches but nevertheless aims at functional cohesion 
this time i think its going to fly says the rev david w 
a taylor of princeton nj general secretary of the consultation 
on church union after 26 years of work weve now got a plan 
before the churches 
taylor a presbyterian said in a telephone interview that the 
plan is workable and realistic and he predicted the involved 
denominations will approve it no question about it i fully 
believe they will 
the plan was recommended unanimously at a meeting early this 
month in new orleans of the consultation involving about 200 
representatives of nine denominations totalling more than 22 million 
members 
this is the time we have been working and praying for said 
the rev gerald f moede a united methodist pastor in adell wis 
as the consultations former general secretary he was a chief 
architect of the plan 
it is termed covenanting and envisages mutual recognition by 
the denominations of one anothers baptism membership and clergy 
allowing intercommunion and joint ministry mission and service 
moede called the plan a biblical format to bring christians 
together sociologically and theologically to meet todays needs and 
those of the future 
it doesnt necessitate overhauling and meshing organizational 
structures usually blocked by power rivalries but continues the 
present structures providing for working partnership and mutual 
interflow of personnel 
what we have been seeking since the beginning is not uniformity 
but unity in things that really matter like membership and ministry 
and mission said the rev george h pike of louisville ky a 
presbyterian 
we are not and never have been seeking a monolithic 
institution 
however the consultation previously had recommended a plan of 
structural union but that 1970 plan soon was dropped after it ran 
into widespread denominational opposition 
that setback followed eight years of work by the consultation 
which was launched in 1962 after the late presbyterian leader eugene 
carson blake urged a unified church that was catholic reformed and 
evangelical 
seconded by the late episcopal bishop james pike blakes 
proposal at an assembly of the national council of churches 
unleashed an ensuing tide of support and sparked formation of the 
consultation 
the nine denominations participating in it are the united 
methodist episcopal and presbyterian churches the christian church 
disciples of christ united church of christ international 
council of community churches and three predominantly black 
methodist denominations 
they are the african methodist episcopal church african 
methodist episcopal zion church and christian methodist episcopal 
church 
after the plan for structural merger collapsed the consultation 
took a new tack working on a theological consensus with an 
agreement reached on it in 1984 
six of the nine denominations have accepted the theological 
agreement as a basis for the next step toward an operational 
covenant and two denominations the ucc and christian churches 
still are to act on the agreement in 1989 
the ninth denomination the episcopal church at its 1988 
convention commended parts of the agreement but said some points 
needed clarified to make it the basis for covnenanting acts 
that reworking done by a drafting committee headed by the rev 
paul a crow jr of indianapolis the christian churchs ecumenical 
officer was the document unanimously approved by the new orleans 
meeting 
pike the consultations outgoing president called the approval 
a historic moment 
united methodist bishop william boyd grove of charleston wva 
commented we are on the threshold of a new pentecostal experience 
of the unity of the church 
crow said his committee had received more than 150 suggested 
changes reflecting a lot of passion and a lot of substance and 
that about 80 percent of them were included in the revised and 
unanimously endorsed plan 
denominational legislative assemblies were were asked to approve 
it as the definitive agreement for joining with other 
participating churches in covenant communion 
action by the nine churches is not expected to be complete before 
the mid1990s since conventions of the denominations are held at 
varying intervals 
african methodist episcopal bishop vinton r anderson of st 
louis was elected president of the consultation succeeding pike 
taylor who replaced moede as consultation general secretary 
three months ago said we believe we are being led by god in a 
new way that has implications far beyond these nine churches the 
unity of the holy catholic church

signs of dawn for a new openness toward religion 
appeared in the soviet union in 1988 while in the united states 
twilight descended on the career of a scandaltainted tv evangelist 
these were among major news stories of religion in a year also 
marked by indignation about a movie blunted hopes about an ancient 
burial shroud and arrests for antiabortion demonstrations 
roman catholicism had its first modern schism while the 
episcopal church seemed on the way to ordaining the first woman 
bishop in world anglicanism and fundamentalists solidified their 
southern baptist control 
also making headlines was an exadministration officials book 
saying nancy reagan consulted an astrologer to help plan president 
reagans schedule and the launching by mainline religious bodies of 
an interfaith cabletv network 
there were numerous other religious notes in the news including 
the failed presidential bids by two baptists the rev jesse 
jackson democrat and pat robertson who resigned the ministry to 
seek the republican nomination 
samplings indicated white protestants including evangelicals and 
the religious right gave the margin to the winner george bush 
the years development that seemed to promise the most longrange 
and historically significant shift in the religious climate began 
unfolding in the soviet union with its new policy of glasnost 
or openness 
in contrast to more than a half century of severe religious 
suppression soviet doors opened to the importation of bibles to 
gradually eased religious restrictions to promised legal revisions 
to assure religious rights 
church dignitaries from around the world took part in soviet 
celebrations marking the millenium of christianity there 
american tv evangelism got a jolt when a prominent practicioner 
jimmy swaggart confessed on the air to moral transgressions later 
disclosed as involvement with a new orleans prostitute 
when he defied disciplinary procedures ordered by the assemblies 
of god and resumed his broadcasts it defrocked him his audience 
dwindled down from 17 million a year ago to 836000 
it was the second recent downfall of a prominent tv evangelist 
jim bakker had been scuttled by a sex scandal the year before 
hollywood sparked a bombshell in religious ranks when it released 
the controversial film the last temptation of christ drawing 
widespread protests and picketing by christians 
the film based on a novel by nikos kazantzakis was criticized 
for depicting christ as weak afraid vacillating and lusting for 
women 
fascination with the shoud of turin got a setback when carbon14 
tests performed at three separate institutions found that it dated 
from medieval times and could not have been the burial cloth 
wrapping christs body 
however some advocates including some scientists questioned 
the procedures used and insisted the issue still was unresolved 
more than 1000 people were arrested and jailed usually briefly 
in a wave of demonstrations of civil disobedience around the country 
to block entrances to abortion clinics 
a minor schism occurred in roman catholicism when traditionalist 
archbishop marcel lefebvre ordained four bishops in defiance of the 
vatican and was excommunicated along with those persisting in his 
movement 
lefebvre rejects reforms of the second vatican council of 
196265 charging it with democratizing and protestantizing 
the church 
the episcopal diocese of massachusetts elected a woman as bishop 
the rev barbara c harris and if the choice is affirmed by other 
dioceses she would become the first woman bishop in the worldwide 
anglican communion 
the anglican church like roman catholicism and eastern 
orthodoxy maintains bishops in succession from apostolic times so 
far confined to men the prospect of a woman in it has stirred 
organized opposition 
fundamentalists continued their decadelong streak of victories 
in the southern baptist convention electing another of their 
adherents the rev jerry vines as president 
his appointive powers largely deterimines institutional trustees 
and the victory this time completed gradual ascendancy of 
fundamentalist majorities on boards throughout the denominations 
institutions and agencies 
other major religion stories of the year included 
american catholic bishops decided to produce another paper on 
aids after some bishops objected to a previous documents reference 
to condoms as a possible protection 
catholic bishops also shot back to the vatican their strong 
objections to a vatican analysis questioning the basis of national 
councils of bishops 
the rev james andrews won reelection as chief executive 
officer of the the presbyterian church usa overcoming a close 
challenge by a woman candidate

the first time randy weston set foot in 
africa the truth of what his father had been telling him hit home 
the chip has to go back to the block from where it came thats 
what pop would tell me the 62yearold jazz pianist and composer 
said during a recent sevenday gig in madrid that found him halfway 
between homes in marrakesh morocco and brooklyn ny 
the truth struck him 27 years ago when he visited nigeria 
senegal and morocco on tours sponsored by the us state department 
that took jazz to africa and inadvertently afroamerican jazz 
musicians to their musical roots 
westons father was frank edward weston born in panama of 
jamaican parents redoubtable cook and host who often invited his 
sons friends and fans home for dinner in brooklyn or tangiers 
before he died in 1981 at the age of 87 
last june weston and a french production company finished taping 
a video called randy in tangiers it opens with the musician and 
a swarm of youngsters pushing a grand piano up a narrow street in 
the medina or arab quarter of the moroccan port that is the 
gateway to africa 
its sort of the story of me and my music and how we learned 
from africa said weston who lived in tangiers from 197 to 1972 
and ran a jazz club above the mauritania cinema 
his son azzedine a percussionist was called niles when he went 
to the american school in tangiers the little niles of the 
classic weston composition his name was changed in a ceremony 
performed by moroccan musicians from the nearby rif mountains 
during his stay in tangiers weston shared musical information 
with longtime resident paul bowles the american writer who 
collected and documented the music of the rif for the library of 
congress and introduced british and american rock musicians to the 
mysteries of the music of the tiny village of jujuka 
weston said if the video is successful he plans to do another 
one in nigeria where he recently received the roots award from the 
nigerian cultural association for his contribution to african music 
the recent emergence of african music and musicians in europe and 
the united states such as king sunny ade johnny clegg and toure 
kunda doesnt surprise weston nor does it shock him that white 
musicians such as paul simon through his graceland album are 
given credit for introducing music previously considered too exotic 
for western tastes 
whats happening now i knew it was going to happen it was 
just a matter of time he said the spirit of africa is 
everywhere 
but the spirit of racism isnt far behind weston added the 
same racism that forced him and many other black american musicians 
to leave the united states in the late 1950s and 60s for europe or 
africa 
weston started playing piano as a child growing up in brooklyn 
he played as a teenager at broadway dance halls that catered to 
lonely servicemen at the outbreak of world war ii he joined the 
segregated us army and served in the quartermaster corps on 
okinawa but wasnt permitted to play in the white army band 
there were white guys who wanted to play with me he said 
wed have to find some old place and if i got hungry theyd have 
to go and buy me a hamburger because i couldnt go in to get my 
own 
when he returned to the states he hung out with fellow pianist 
thelonious monk and played with drummers charlie persip and max 
roach and saxophonists coleman hawkins johnny griffin and charlie 
bird parker 
weston has mixed feelings about bird clint eastwoods film 
about parker the legendary saxophonist who helped create bebop 
he puts so much emphasis on the drugs that the beautiful things 
dont come through weston said this music is also about 
family we know we are just the continuation of a culture its a 
very beautiful story and i dont like to see it distorted 
weston doesnt have a permanent band sometimes he plays in 
marrakesh and new york with the guennaoua moroccan descendants of 
black slaves who dance and play small metallic cymbals and whose 
haunting tunes form the base of blue moses one of westons 
recent compositions 
in madrid and on a paris gig he toured with 
trinidadianamerican saxophonist talib kibwe and swissbased ghanian 
percussionist eric asante

the celluloid torch has been passed to a new 
generation filmmakers who grew up in the 1960s 
platoon running on empty 1969 and mississippi 
burning are among the movies released in the past two years from 
writers and directors who brought their own experiences of that 
turbulent decade to the screen 
the contemporaries of the 60s are some of the filmmakers of 
the 80s its natural said robert friedman the senior vice 
president of worldwide advertising and publicity at warner bros 
chris gerolmo who wrote the screenplay for mississippi 
burning noted that the sheer passage of time has allowed him and 
others to express their feelings about the decade 
distance is important he said i believe theres a lot of 
thinking about that time and america in general 
the vietnam war was a defining experience for many people in the 
60s shattering the consensus that the united states had a right 
even a moral duty to intervene in conflicts around the world even 
today politicians talk disparagingly of the vietnam syndrome in 
referring to the countrys reluctance to use military force to 
settle disputes 
i think future historians will talk about vietnam as one of the 
near destructions of american society said urie brofenbrenner a 
professor of sociology at cornell university 
in world war ii we knew what we were fighting for but not in 
vietnam 
full metal jacket gardens of stone platoon good 
morning vietnam hamburger hill and bat 21 all use the 
war as a dramatic backdrop and show how it shaped characters lives 
the vietnam war has remained an emotional issue in the united 
states as veterans have struggled to come to terms with their 
experiences one was oliver stone who wrote and directed the 
academy awardwinning platoon 
i saw platoon eight times said john j anderson a palm 
beach county sheriffs lieutenant who served in vietnam in 196667 
i cried the first time i saw it and the third and fourth 
times platoon helped me understand 
stone who based platoon on some of his own experiences as a 
grunt said the film brought up issues that had yet to be resolved 
people are responding to the fact that its real theyre 
curious about the war in vietnam after 20 years he said 
while southeast asia was the pivotal foreign issue in american 
society of the 60s civil rights was the major domestic issue the 
civil rights movement reached its peak in the freedom summer of 
1964 when large groups of volunteers headed south to help register 
black voters 
in five corners a movie about the summer of 64 in the bronx 
starring jodie foster her friend played by tim robbins leaves his 
neighborhood to volunteer in the south after seeing the rev martin 
luther king jr on television 
alan parkers mississippi burning focuses on an incident that 
clouded the mississippi summer project when 1000 young volunteers 
from mainstream america swept into the state to help register black 
voters the movie is a fictionalized account of the disappearance 
and slaying of three civil rights workers michael schwerner andrew 
goodman and james chaney 
they were reported missing on june 21 several hours after being 
stopped for speeding near philadelphia miss after a nationally 
publicized search their bodies were discovered aug 4 on a farm 
just outside the town 
one of those who recalled the incident was gerolmo a student in 
the new york public school system at the time the screenwriter said 
the incident had a powerful effect on his way of thinking 
it was the first time i ever considered that our country could 
be wrong gerolmo said 
the film stars willem dafoe and gene hackman star as fbi agents 
who try to find the bodies of the missing workers and overcome 
fierce local resistance to solve the crime 
in a more offbeat and outrageous way john waters hairspray 
discusses integration in baltimore in 1963 when a group of 
teenagers tries to break down the barriers of a segregated dance 
show 
also set in baltimore is barry levinsons tin men starring 
danny devito and richard dreyfuss as two slick aluminum siding 
salesmen in the early 60s the movie mirrored a squarely 
middleclass culture one that was not caught up in sex politics 
and drugs 
instead of focusing on a wellknown historic event 
writerdirector ernest thompson takes a more personal approach in 
1969 robert downey jr and keifer sutherland star as college 
students who battle their parents and each other over sex drugs and 
the vietnam war 
i was 19 in 1969 it was a fulcrum time for me said 
thompson who was a student at american university at the time i 
think it was just the right time in my growth as an artist and as a 
man to try to write about something that happened in my youth 
running on empty takes place in the 80s but the 60s are 
much in evidence judd hirsch and christine lahti play antiwar 
activists who sabatoged a napalm plant in 1970 and are forced to 
live underground with their two children 
naomi foner who wrote running on empty and also served as 
the films executive producer grew up in brooklyn ny the 
daughter of sociologists her own experiences made foner well 
qualified to give running on empty its strong political theme 
i lived through that time and ive wanted to find the right way 
to present it to this generation said foner a member of the 
radical students for a democratic society while attending graduate 
school at columbia university 
foner who also taught in harlems head start program and helped 
register voters in south carolina said many young people are 
curious about what happened in the 60s 
a lot of them think it was an exciting time that they were 
sorry to have missed she said 
brofenbrenner said movies are a good indicator of the concerns of 
the general public the principle impact of the media is that they 
reflect the values of the larger society 
film is a very powerful art medium he said i believe it 
very accurately reflects not only the prevailing but the coming 
trends its because film writers like other writers are 
perceptive people they get the message of whats going on

at 1 pm on wednesday vice president george 
bush will enter the house of representatives and announce he has 
been elected president 426 to 111 fulfilling a ritual that has 
been called constitutional russian roulette 
bushs declaration to a joint session of congress will come after 
the counting of the only ballots that really count under the 
constitution those cast by the 538 members of the electoral college 
yes its true that bush won 534 percent of the popular votes 
defeating his democratic rival michael dukakis who captured 456 
percent its true he got more than 7 million votes more than his 
opponent 
but under the constitution the voting in november was only a 
preliminary round the voters in fact only elected electors 
the election is over with the counting on wednesday of ballots 
cast by the electors on dec 20 when they met in their state 
capitals 
there was one surprise west virginia elector margaret leach cast 
her ballot for lloyd bentsen for president and dukakis for vice 
president reversing the order of the democratic ticket 
i did it for a reason and the reaseon was to make a statement 
about the electoral college said leach a nurse in huntington 
wva it was fine then when it was established but weve 
outgrown it 
no other democracy in the world does it quite this way 
as one might suspect the process is the result of a compromise 
one of the very first compromises in the 200year history of the 
united states under the constitution 
in august 1787 the constitutional convention meeting in 
philadelphia found itself unable to agree on a method of selecting 
the president 
direct popular election was opposed by delegates who feared that 
most people would not know enough about the candidates to make a 
wise choice other objections were raised to proposals that congress 
select the president or that state legislatures do it 
a committee was appointed and it hammered together a solution 
the solution each state would appoint presidential electors 
equal to the total number of its senators and representatives in 
congress 
in present day terms that comes to 435 members of the house of 
representatives and 100 members of the senate plus three electoral 
votes for the district of columbia 
on election day the voters of each state actually choose 
electors pledged to the candidate of their choice and selected by 
state party organizations 
to win election a presidential candidate must receive 270 
electoral votes an absolute majority 
if no candidate scores that high the winner is picked by the 
house of representatives from the three top vote getters in that 
process each state delegation casts just one vote the elections of 
1800 and 1824 were decided that way 
if no vice presidential candidate gets a majority the victor is 
chosen by the senate from the top two the last time that happened 
was in 1836 
under the original system the candidate receiving the largest 
number of electoral votes was elected president the runner up 
became vice president 
in 1800 the electors made a mistake they gave equal numbers of 
votes to thomas jefferson and aaron burr a result that forced the 
contest into the house where it took 36 ballots to settle the issue 
in jeffersons favor 
the 12th amendment to the constitution enacted four year later 
provided for separate votes for president and vice president ending 
the possibility of a repeat performance 
electoral ballots are first counted and certified in each state 
capitol 
the certificates are opened in the house of representives by the 
vice president acting in his constitutional role as president of 
the senate 
four tellers two from the house two from the senate count the 
votes of each states electors then hand the tally to the vice 
president who announces them in alphabetical order 
in theory it is quite possible for someone other than bush or 
vice presidentelect dan quayle to be the winner 
it wont happen but it could 
socalled faithless electors have voted from time to time for 
candidates other than those to which they were pledged as west 
virginias leach did this time around 
the league of women voters points out that faithless electors 
could cause a candidate who had won the popular vote to wind up one 
or two votes short in the electoral college 
and in a close election perhaps one in which the votes are split 
by a third party it is possible that the candidate with the largest 
popular vote might lose in the electoral college this could happen 
because of the winnertakeall rule in which the candidate who wins 
most of the votes in a state gets all of that states electoral 
votes 
over the years atttempts have been made to shut down the 
electoral college replacing it perhaps with a system of direct 
election 
in 1968 the late rep hale boggs dla said there was a 
crying need to amend the constitution and once and for all get rid 
of this anachronistic system which every four years puts us in the 
position of playing russian roulette with the election of the 
president of the united states 
one proposal would eliminate the winnertakeall aspects of the 
electoral college by awarding electoral votes by congressional 
districts with only two electors chosen on a statewide basis 
former sen birch bayh dind fought a long but ultimately 
unsuccessful battle to enact a constitutional amendment providing 
for the direct election of the president and vice president by 
abolishing the electoral system 
under that proposal the pair of candidates with the most votes 
would be elected if they received at least 40 percent of the ballots 
nationwide a runoff election would be required if no slate received 
40 percent 
the runoff provision was the focus of most objections and the 
senate defeated the proposed amendment in 1979 
there are those who think it would be a mistake to scrap the 
electoral college 
that argument was made in the 1971 book the case against direct 
election of the president a defense of the electoral college by 
judith best 
acknowledging the present system is not perfect she said it may 
have a silver lining 
the prospect of a runnerup presidency the prospect of winning 
the popular but not the electoral vote spurs the parties to seek 
the support of broad cross sections of the nation she wrote 
the risk of a runnerup presidency may not be too great a price to 
pay for a system which minimizes conflicts promises stability 
suppresses factions promotes moderation and requires a broad base 
of support 
as a whole she said the electoral college system has succeeded 
never failing to fill the office of the president 
like all living things it has imperfections and defects but it 
functions indeed it thrives she said

political force that seeks public support in huaycan and the other 
makeshift communities where twothirds of limas 7 million people 
scrape along 
about 10000 people live in huaycan their huts built of straw 
mats line the bonedry slopes of the andean foothills 15 miles east 
of downtown lima 
most residents are poor migrants from the violent highlands where 
the rebel movement was born they make ideal recruits for the 
shining path sendero luminoso in spanish 
shining paths move into a more public role and through most of 
peru from its andean base in ayacucho province has coincided with 
economic collapse and annual inflation of nearly 2000 percent 
in the cities the guerrillas combine conventional politics with 
terror in the countryside they make everbolder attacks on the 
military 
rebel columns strike along the spine of the andes from the 
ecuadorean frontier in the north to bolivia in the south the 
guerrillas also work with drug traffickers in perus eastern jungle 
source of the raw material for much of the worlds cocaine and buy 
sophisticated weapons with the profits 
more than 12000 people have been killed in the civil war most 
of them andean peasants slain by rebels or security forces and 
official figures put damage to the shattered economy at 10 billion 
the guerrillas are believed to have only about 5000 armed 
combatants so they do not appear close to seizing power but there 
is increasing pessimism about the prospects of controlling them 
most evaluations of sendero luminosos eightyear expansion 
under the democratic system have become increasingly grim the 
andean report a respected economic journal said recently 
one reason the movement grows is its appeal to perus indians 
subjected for centuries to scorn and discrimination by the white 
ruling elite 
political violence in peru is not the result of poverty alone 
but of humiliation oppression hate between classes racism sen 
enrique bernales chairman of a committee on violence said when it 
released a report in september 
the most striking development of the last 18 months has been the 
shining paths move into public view in this grimy capital on south 
americas pacific coast 
rebels organize support groups in the slums infiltrate labor 
unions organize marches spread their message of revolution with 
the aid of a sympathetic daily newspaper and agitate among 
university students 
analysts and experts on counterinsurgency say shining path 
appears bent on dominating the radical left of legal politics 
officials have become alarmed by the broadening of tactics to 
include infiltration of legitimate organizations including unions 
of government workers they say this clouds distinctions between the 
legal and illegal left making it move difficult to combat the rebel 
movement 
sendero is seeking semilegal status as a way of winning 
militants and sympathizers while at the same time generating a 
confusing situation in which the security forces indiscrimately 
repress members of the legal left along with leftist insurgents a 
ranking police official said privately 
guzman a marxist philosophy professor founded sendero luminoso 
in 1970 in ayacucho an andean state capital 230 miles southeast of 
lima where he had built a following at the university of huamanga 
followers call guzman 54 the fourth sword of marxism after 
marx lenin and mao 
his movement a splinter group of the communist party gathered 
strength in indian communities of the southern andes for 10 years 
before launching its guerrilla war 
according to counterinsurgency experts the guerrillas switched 
their emphasis to the cities because migration of indian peasants to 
urban centers accelerated after the highlands became a battlefield 
guzmans guerrillas have followed tens of thousands of peasants 
from the andes into limas shantytowns and see the slums as a new 
stronghold 
in july the proshining path newspaper el diario published a 
48page report on the guerrilla movement it quoted guzman as saying 
in his first interview since going underground in 1980 
we had to follow the road from the countryside to the city we 
must prepare for the insurrection that is coming which means the 
taking of the cities 
he said conditions were ripe for the next stage in the struggle 
for power inciting a coup against president alan garcia by 
provoking economic chaos and increasing attacks on the army 
the final stage he said would be a popular uprising against a 
repressive military regime 
shining path has infiltrated 167 unions and neighborhood 
associations in the lima slums this year says a confidential 
interior ministry report obtained by the associated press 
guerrillas threaten and sometimes kill community leaders 
establish peoples schools and set up street theaters for 
propaganda it said 
cardinal juan landazuri of the roman catholic church said 
priests tell me that young people in the shantytowns are going 
over to sendero i have been in a shantytown where there is a 
shining path group and the police are doing nothing about it 
huaycan is one of the slums where shining path works hardest 
because it is just off the central highway a strategic route 
through the capitals main industrial zone to the mountains the 
industrial zone contains 850 of the countrys most important 
factories 
redpainted slogans hailing the peoples war and president 
gonzalo the rebel name for guzman cover the concreteblock 
clinic other buildings with solid walls and even large rocks 
residents were suspicious and uncommunicative when an associated 
press reporter visited except for three 10yearold boys at the 
entrance who laughed and waved red flags with the shining paths 
hammerandsickle emblem 
the central highway passes through what looks like a military 
zone most factories are behind high walls topped with barbed wire 
and towers from which guards with automatic rifles keep watch 
guerrillas killed three plant managers in 1988 who were involved 
in labor disputes union leaders also are uneasy 
i doubt if youll find any union leader who will declare he 
is a senderista but ill bet youll find many who are afraid to say 
anything against sendero an american labor adviser said on 
condition of anonymity 
the highway ties lima to the agricultural lands of the central 
andes and perus most important mines where unions threatened by 
the shining path have conducted a strike since late october that 
costs millions of dollars a day in export earnings

a paramilitary death squad has made its 
appearance in peru where terror and violence grow as the economy 
collapses 
opposition politicians claim the rodrigo franco command named 
for a government official killed by shining path guerrillas in 1987 
has links to president alan garcias populist aprista party he and 
other officials deny it the group is blamed for at least two 
murders it has claimed responsibility for death threats and 
bombings aimed at both conservative critics of the government and 
people suspected of supporting the maoist rebels 
its first appearance was in july with the kidnap and murder of a 
lawyer who defended osman morote considered no 2 man to abimael 
guzman in shining path the rodrigo franco command claimed 
responsibility 
police also blame it for the killing of a university professor 
who had openly expressed support for the rebels 
other actions of the paramilitary group include 
bombing the tomb of guerrilla leader edith lagos in ayacucho 
birthplace of shining and threatening carlos escobar a prosecutor 
investigating reports of an army massacre of peasants believed 
sympathetic to the rebels 
making threats to several ayacucho journalists about their 
reporting on the guerrilla war and bombing the lima homes of staff 
members of el diario a newspaper that supports the rebels 
one of its statements said for every murdered mayor soldier 
or policeman a leader of the shining path or its support groups 
will die 
garcias government announced an investigation in november after 
the rodrigo franco command bombed the home of news magazine 
publisher franciso igartua and threatened an opposition senator and 
two leading journalists who are critics of the government but not 
leftists 
whoever leads the paramilitary group must be a fool who 
believes he is helping the government garcia said at the time 
no arrests have been made and the organizations leaders have not 
been identified

the new kibbutzniks may not be yuppies 
yet but some of israels socialist communes are modifying the 
collective life with whitecollar jobs privacy and selffulfillment 
beit oren one of the oldest communal farms is leading the 
experiment with ideas that were anathema to the pioneers private 
ownership paying salaries and letting members choose their own jobs 
the kibbutz perches on a ridge carmel mountains in the forest for 
which it is named immigrants from romania and elsewhere in eastern 
europe founded beit oren in 1939 
they brought to it the utopian concept of a work collective 
inspired by the russian revolution the communes were not only 
social experiments but tools for taming the land and changing the 
jews image from ghetto dweller to farmer 
members worked ate and slept on the farm they shared equally 
both the kitchen and nursery tasks and outside labor in cattle pens 
and citrus groves 
status was a reward for hard work the communes were known for 
producing the toughest soldiers and most upright officials and 
politicians 
gradually over the past two decades kibbutz life has changed 
many have eased the rules that all money and property be shared 
equally members now have such personal luxuries as color 
televisions and microwave ovens and more hold private jobs off the 
farm 
changes being debated throughout the network are more 
fundamental and beit oren is in the forefront of those redefining 
the nature of kibbutz life 
it also has a special motivation the need to attract new members 
who can help erase a 65 million debt that nearly forced the 
settlement to close in 1987 
if the experiment works it could be adopted by the approximately 
300 other collective farms in israel which suffer from a flight of 
young people to the cities and a combined debt of nearly 4 billion 
beit orens leaders believe the main drawback of collective 
farms where only about 3 percent of israels 42 million people 
live is their failure to recognize a change in social emphasis from 
selfsacrifice to selffulfillment they say young people want 
material rewards and more exctiting careers 
we are trying to make a better kibbutz by changing the role of 
the individual said zeev shabtai 48 it used to be that the 
individual worked for the collective this is over people no longer 
want to be a tool lets allow the society to be the tool 
promises of change have doubled the number of residents to 110 at 
beit oren just south of port city of haifa about onethird work 
outside the kibbutz at ranging from marketing to teaching 
others soon will earn salaries for working in the commune all 
socialist principles have not disappeared however so pay will be 
the same no matter what the job 
kibbutz members will be free to spend their money as they choose 
even to squander it on such capitalist luxuries as vacations abroad 
or stereo equipment 
under the old system all income regardless of source went into 
the kibbutz treasury to be shared by all 
beit oren usually would buy televisions for example only when 
it could afford one for each family using kibbutz cars for 
vacations was a matter of strict scheduling and travel abroad was 
rare 
in exchange for the new freedom beit oren plans to charge 
individual members for such things as electricity water and food 
rather than paying the bills collectively shabtai said the main 
purpose is to reduce waste 
this will make people feel more responsible he said the 
way it is now people figure if i go through a red light the kibbutz 
pays the fine unlimited collective responsibility simply brings 
corruption 
kibbutz leaders envision commuter communes and hope to attract 
urban professionals 
today the whole kibbutz movement is moving toward this 
change said beit orens secretary shmuel cohen the young 
generation doesnt find the same challenge on the kibbutz as they 
used to and we need to bring them back 
zvi carmi 67 a founder of beit oren expressed disappointment 
that his three children left it but said he hopes more free 
enterprise will reverse the trend 
the kibbutz was born into a reality of material poverty and 
ideological wealth he said today spiritualism and vision is 
lacking the cities are very tempting we are surrounded by a 
private lifestyle people want their own careers 
one young urbanite who found his niche is yoel kadish 30 who 
has three children and came to beit oren from a tel aviv suburb to 
start a factory that makes relief maps 
this is something really new zionism 1988 a different 
approach to life to be an individual and in a collective he said 
in the city theres too much social isolation this is what i 
always wanted but with more privacy

the morning light comes late and slowly in 
dublin in december but it perseveres it seems a fitting metaphor 
for irelands economy as it emerges from a long darkness 
after a particularly harsh recession ireland is enjoying a 
revival spurred by prime minister charles haugheys fiscal austerity 
the turnaround is showing up in a moderate but steady economic 
growth rate lower interest rates a trade surplus even the 
unemployment rate is inching down from near 20 percent 
ireland is improving physically as well dublin got a facelift 
during its millennium celebrations this year and a huge financial 
center is being built on derelict docklands 
but critics complain that the improvements in this small green 
island republic of 34 million people are not filtering through to 
the jobless and destitute some so poor they have no bathrooms and 
feed their children corn flakes for dinner 
the irish continue to emigrate at an estimated 32000 a year or 
1 percent of the population the highest level since the 1950s that 
sometimes is cited as a contributing factor in the declining 
unemployment rate although it has not been quantified 
others say the future is clouded by impatience for bigger and 
better results and by uncertainty introduced by the prime ministers 
ill health haughey 62 has been repeatedly hospitalized for kidney 
stones and a severe respiratory infection this year 
the conflict in northern ireland the britishruled onesixth of 
the island also casts a shadow over relations between ireland and 
britain its biggest trading partner and the vicissitudes of modern 
life intrude on irelands traditional conservative culture 
1988 is going to be one of the greatest years from the point 
of view from the irish economy for at least 20 years haughey 
said in a recent speech to the fianna fail his political party 
we are ready to make a major advance in the irish economy in the 
next three years 
even michael noonan finance spokesman for the principal 
opposition party fine gael said in an interview things are 
improving 
they have our support on the main economic policies 
however noonan added the improvement of the economy is not 
felt in the daytoday lives of people that is something that if 
it doesnt change will affect the consensus 
most dramatic has been haugheys transformation from big spender 
to budget slasher when he became prime minister for the third time 
following the february 1987 election he moved quickly to cut 
irelands runaway public borrowing for social services it couldnt 
afford 
such spending had begun a debt spiral a decade ago and the 
economy worsened severely with the oilprice rises of the 1970s 
haughey by the second year of his fiveyear term has restrained 
public expenditure to cut public borrowing to about 5 percent of 
gross national product from a 1981 peak of 15 percent 
the moves were made possible by the unusual political consensus 
between the minority government and the principal opposition 
indeed many of haugheys remedies are precisely those advocated by 
noonans fine gael during its 198287 term of office 
fine gael under haugheys predecessor garret fitzgerald 
governed in coalition with the socialist labor party which 
constantly hampered fine gaels austerity programs and finally 
brought the government down in a dispute over cuts in welfare 
spending 
the present minority government owes its survival partly to 
haugheys personal charisma partly to fine gaels knowledge that if 
the government fell now it would be reelected with an increased 
majority 
an opinion poll published in the irish times in december gave 
haugheys party a 51percent approval rating its highest since the 
last election against 26 percent for the opposition 
said economist jim oleary of davy stockbrokers dublins largest 
investment firm one of the best things that has happened to this 
country in the last three or four years is that we have a situation 
that the major parties have arrived at a consensus about economic 
policy 
although specific cutbacks have worsened unemployment dampened 
consumer spending and drawn vociferous opposition from affected 
groups the irish generally support the tight grip as a muchneeded 
measure and confidence has been bolstered experts said

the government has also begun to reform irelands high taxes by 
bringing more people into the lowest income tax rate of 35 percent 
but annual earnings above 11500 pounds 17700 remain subject to 
an extraordinary marginal rate of 58 percent 
at the same time a tax amnesty in the past year has earned the 
government a 500 millionpound 770 million windfall 
the government plans to relax exchange rate controls at the 
beginning of 1989 signaling confidence that the economy is strong 
enough for funds not to flee the country 
private economists expect the economic growth rate to be about 3 
percent when all the figures are in for 1988 and the same for 1989 
after a 48 percent spurt in 1987 
the economy dominated by chemicals pharmaceuticals 
electronics light engineering and agriculture has been boosted by 
strong exports some of which come from the many foreignowned 
plants ireland has attracted 
exports increased 133 percent in 1987 to give ireland its first 
current account surplus in 20 years 
interest rates have declined to 85 percent from 14 percent in 
early 1987 and annual inflation is running at a 28yearlow of about 
21 percent which is expected to hold steady compared with 20 
percent in 1981 
those improvements have encouraged consumer spending 3 percent 
higher in 1988 after a flat 1987 they also have encouraged some 
investment and fueled a housing boom 
unemployment has dropped below 18 percent to about 234000 
jobless people from a peak of 194 percent in january 1987 and 
should continue declining 
but the big problems remain 
largely rural ireland is still northern europes poorest country 
with per capita gross domestic product of 5123 in 1987 according 
to the parisbased organization for economic cooperation and 
development it is one of the lowest figures in the 24member group 
the economic and social research institute in dublin says 1 
million people are poor other studies show that nearly 40 percent 
of the population depends to some degree on social welfare payments 
its hard for any mother to face that to keep saying no 
no martha carrig a mother from newmarketonfergus said in a 
recent documentary on poverty aired on rte the state television 
network 
an unidentified waterford woman told rte there are people 
hungry in this country you come down and live with us and tell us 
were not hungry 
unemployment is irelands no 1 economic and social problem 
critics say it is exacerbated by the high birth rates in a 
93percent roman catholic country where most forms of contraception 
are illegal by rigid labor union contracts and by an emphasis on 
free education that has produced more students than there are 
taxpayers 
with no jobs to go to college graduates areamong the first to 
emigrate 
people are voting with their feet the ultimate vote of no 
confidence is to leave the country says brendan walsh an 
economics professor at university college dublin 
ireland also is shadowed by the protestantcatholic feuding in 
northern ireland where more than 2700 people have died since 1969 
and the outlawed irish republican army fights with bombs and bullets 
to unite the predominantly protestant province with the irish 
republic 
onethird of the armys 385 million annual defense budget goes 
to policing the border against the ira and the police spend a 
similar amount although the violence hardly ever spills into the 
irish republic officials are convinced it hurts tourism 
in addition irelands traditional selfimage as a christian 
moral and safe place is being battered by violent crime drug abuse 
and women flocking to britain to seek abortions walsh said 
abortion and divorce are banned in the constitution 
but for all the difficulties there is hope 
it now looks like weve turned the corner said joe durkan 
one of irelands leading economists who works for the accounting 
firm coopers and lybrand in dublin theres no reason the economy 
should not do very very well its going to go foreward

corporate profit growth will slow sharply in 1989 
for companies in the standard amp poors 500 index reflecting a 
national economic slowdown the business information concern said 
profits for sampp 500 companies should rise by about 11 percent 
from 1988 compared with an estimated gain of 41 percent this year 
according to an sampp study released tuesday 
overall economic growth next year should slow to about twothirds 
of its 1988 pace curbing corporate profits said sampp chief 
economist david m blitzer 
the nations gross national product the broadest measure of 
economic growth grew at an average rate of just under 3 percent 
during the first nine months of this year the rate was curbed 
slightly because of the effects of the summer drought on the 
nations farm production 
slower growth in exports and business capital spending along 
with higher interest rates will retard economic expansion 
blitzer said when economic growth slows profit gains are one of 
the first places to feel it 
sampps annual corporate profit study indicated most major industry 
groups would see profit growth of between 10 percent and 15 percent 
although auto industry profits are expected to decline 
blitzer said increasing wage pressures and rising interest 
expenses during the first half of the year are two factors that 
could narrow profits in 1989 higher interest rates and weaker 
earnings prospects also could depress stock prices as investors 
pursue increasingly attractive returns in fixedincome investments 
such as bonds 
but at the same time lower stock valuations may not trigger a 
bull market he said stock prices currently are at roughly 10 times 
sampps projected 1989 corporate earnings down significantly from 
1987s highs but not low enough to suggest a mad rush into 
stocks blitzer said 
standard amp poors analysts indicated earnings growth would be 
strongest in the drug and pharmaceutical sector where profits were 
expected to rise by 19 percent in 1989 matching the estimated 
growth for this year because of firmer pricing stable raw material 
costs and a weak dollar that will aid drug makers foreign 
operations 
among other highlighted industries 
retailing profits were expected to rise by 12 percent to 15 
percent indicating increased consumer spending spurred by more 
popular fashions and relatively moderate price increases 
profits for the big three domestic automakers were expected to 
decline by 4 percent due to an expected 2 percent drop in sales 
amid heightened competition that could include profitcurbing sales 
incentives 
money center bank profits should be flat as those companies 
seek ways to meet new regulatory capital guidelines while regional 
bank holding companies could see 9 percent to 10 percent earnings 
growth 
the semiconductor industry should continue its recovery from a 
mid1980s slump although profits will grow only about 10 percent 
due to increased worldwide production capacity and renewed foreign 
competition 
profit growth should be in the respectable 10 percent range 
for railroads and chemical companies with railroads benefiting from 
their workforce streamlinings of recent years and chemical makers 
enjoying record worldwide demand low crude oil prices and the weak 
dollar

the average japanese worker got a 44 percent pay 
raise in 1988 or about 75 more each month the labor ministry said 
tuesday 
a ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the increase was higher than last years 36 percent the lowest 
since the annual wage survey began in 1965 the highest was 293 
percent in 1974 
the official attributed this years rise to recovery from a 
business slump last year triggered by the yens rapid appreciation 
against the us dollar the higher yen makes japanese goods more 
expensive abroad and has hurt companies heavily dependent on exports 
for its wage increase figure the official said the ministry 
questioned 3200 private companies with 100 employes or more at 
random in september japanese wage bargaining is conducted in the 
spring 
the official said that in 1987 the average monthly wage for a 
japanese worker in a company with 30 employees or more was 2710 
including overtime bonuses and allowances such workers account for 
about half of japans total work force of 44 million

the number of working oil and natural gas rigs 
increased by 10 to total 940 marking the third straight week of 
gains industry watcher baker hughes inc reported 
last week the count increased by eight to total 930 the count 
increased by 17 in the previous week a year ago the number of rigs 
totaled 1145 
baker hughes economist ike kerridge said the yearend surge 
capped an otherwise disappointing quarter 
we normally would see a considerably greater increase than we 
had in the fourth quarter kerridge said tuesday normally we 
see an increase in drilling because companies are spending what was 
left in their drilling budgets that didnt happen this year 
the count averaged 922 working rigs in the fourth quarter 
usually the strongest of the year compared to 999 in the first 901 
in the second and an average 924 rigs in the third quarter kerridge 
said 
it will probably be down again next week if it follows the 
normal seasonal pattern kerridge said 
the count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity 
and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of 
last friday not the number of rigs actively producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the number of working rigs since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
compiling figures 
the lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on may 2 
among major oil producing states the biggest gains were posted 
by texas with 12 additional rigs followed by oklahoma seven 
wyoming six ohio four and louisiana two 
north dakota had the biggest decline with six fewer rigs 
followed by california four colorado three michigan two and

paradynes stock at 1025 a share in cash atampt will finance the

release from atampt 
an atampt spokesman in new york was not immediately available to 
comment on the action 
paradyne based in largo develops and manufactures data 
communications equipment and provides sales and service both 
domestically and overseas 
the company ran into legal troubles last year paradyne pleaded 
guilty in 1987 to conspiring to defraud the government and paid a 
12 million fine 
the charges grew out of a computer equipment contract paradyne 
won in 1981 from the social security administration prosecutors 
claimed that the company won the contract unfairly and did not have 
ready the equipment it said it had 
the companies plan to merge the existing data communications 
equipment operations of paradyne and atampt with the resulting 
business entity becoming a subsidiary of atampt john mitcham 
president and chief executive officer of paradyne will head the 
subsidiary 
both atampt and paradyne now offer strong product lines to our 
customers said jack bucter atampt vice president for product 
management and marketing merging these lines will enable this new 
atampt subsidiary to offer an even more comprehensive line of products 
and services to meet our customers global data networking needs 
paradyne had 1987 worldwide sales of 233 million with assets 
totaling 263 million the comany has 115 locations around the 
world including manufacturing facilities in largo and sales offices 
in the united states britain canada japan and hong kong 
the company distributes products in 47 countries and employs 
2600 people worldwide 
atampt had 1987 revenues of 336 billion and part of its business 
includes the manufacture of data communications equipment in 
montgomery ill for sale in the united states 
atampt generally does not publicly report sales assets or 
employees for most of its individual business units including that 
portion of business devoted to data communications equipment 
the tender offer is subject to the condition that at least 501 
percent of the paradyne stock is tendered and not withdrawn 
following the tender offer paradyne will be merged with an atampt 
subsidiary and any shareholders who did not tender their paradyne 
stock would receive the offering price of 1025 a share 
paradyne also granted atampt an option to acquire under certain 
conditions up to 25 percent of paradynes stock at 1025 a share

the reagan administration announced today that 
it will impose trade sanctions valued at 100 million on a variety 
of european food products if the european community goes forward 
with a threatened ban on imports of american meat treated with 
growth hormones 
the action would steeply increase prices of selected foreign 
imports for american consumers including some meats beverages and 
pet foods 
us trade representative clayton yeutter said higher import 
duties which would double the wholesale price for the goods 
entering the united states would go into effect at 1201 am on 
jan 1 
i regret that the united states is forced to retaliate against 
the european communitys ban on meat treated by growth hormones 
yeutter said in a statement despite the ecs claim that the 
animal hormone ban is based on health concerns the ec has yet to 
present any evidence that proper application of the growth producing 
hormones in question poses any threat to human health 
the administration is charging that the action by the 12nation 
european community constitutes an unfair trade practice because it 
was taken without what the united states considered to be a 
scientific basis 
in los angeles where president reagan is vacationing deputy 
white house press secretary leslye arsht said we obviously feel 
we must be aggressive in the trade positions we taken but the 
european community are our allies and we are major trading partners 
we have our differences over trade but there is a mechanism 
for resolving them and we have no reason to believe this one wont 
be resolved also 
just before christmas the european communitys decisionmaking 
body the council of ministers voted to let the ban on us meat 
imports take effect automatically on jan 1 an action the countries 
have been threatening to take for more than a year 
the europeans have warned that if the united states retaliates 
it will counterretaliate threatening a fullblown trade war 
between two of the worlds largest trading partners 
along with his announcement yeutter released a list of the 
european products upon which the higher 100 percent duties will be 
imposed these products include danish hams italian canned 
tomatoes beef alcoholic beverages containing less than 7 percent 
alcohol fruit juices and pet food

japans currentaccount surplus grew during november 
from a year earlier the finance ministry announced tuesday but 
officials said they still expect the gap to decline for the full 
year ending march 31 
the finance ministry said the surplus in the current account 
which measures trade in goods and services grew to 676 billion in 
november from 593 billion a year earlier the second consecutive 
monthly rise 
the overall trade surplus during the month also rose to 756 
billion from 669 billion in november 1987 although imports grew 
at a faster rate than exports 
the finance ministry also announced that japans currentaccount 
surplus with the united states in the first six months of this year 
fell by 122 percent to 237 billion from 269 billion in the 
yearearlier period 
the monthly currentaccount gap had been narrowing steadily since 
january mainly as a result of a successful attempt by major 
industrial countries to guide the dollar down in value against the 
japanese yen and other key currencies a stronger yen tends to brake 
japanese exports by making them more expensive overseas 
but despite the recent increases finance ministry officials 
indicated the surplus was likely to shrinkk in the fiscal year that 
ends march 31 they pointed out that imports remain strong due to 
robust domestic demand and this will serve to hold the gap down 
they traced the november surplus growth partly to a drop in oil 
imports due to lower imports volume and declining oil prices 
exports rose 188 percent to 222 billion from 186 billion a 
year earlier while overall imports surged 222 percent to 146 
billion from 12 billion in the yearearlier month 
officials attributed the strong import growth to domestic demand 
for such products as textiles and nonferrous metals needed to fuel 
the growing japanese economy 
the socalled invisible account which includes transactions in 
shipping tourism banking insurance and commodities had a 560 
million deficit down from a 116 million yearearlier surplus 
the deficit partly reflects the increasing number of japanese 
traveling overseas because of the strong yen 
the sixmonth currentaccount report also indicated that during 
the period japans trade surplus with the united states fell 139 
percent to 236 billion from 274 billion a year earlier 
exports to the united states rose 49 percent to 41 billion 
while imports jumped 492 percent to 174 billion 
japans overall firsthalf currentaccount surplus fell 155 
percent to 37 billion from 437 billion the trade surplus fell 
103 percent to 435 billion

public service co of new hampshire on 
tuesday filed a bankruptcy reorganization plan that would leave it 
federally regulated and able to charge ratepayers for its seabrook 
nuclear plant whether or not the reactor ever operates 
the company said it will seek rate increases of 30 percent to 40 
percent over three to five years 
nine months after it became the first major investorowned 
utility to seek protection from creditors since the depression new 
hampshires largest utility disclosed a plan to escape state 
regulation governorelect judd gregg and other state officials 
vowed to oppose the move 
us bankruptcy judge james yacos had said that if public service 
met tuesdays deadline for filing a reorganization proposal he 
would bar competing plans for another two months while the utility 
keeps trying to reach an agreement with creditors and other parties 
in the case 
the negotiation process does not end with the filing of this 
plan said charles bayless senior vice president and chief 
financial officer we feel it is just the beginning of another 
stage of negotiations 
what we are filing today is our opening position with the 
parties i can tell you none of them agrees with it bayless said 
the economy can certainly accept that kind of rate increase 
the question is whether the politicians can accept it he said 
referring to the proposed rate hikes of 30 percent to 40 percent 
over three to five years 
an agreement with creditors would shorten greatly what could be a 
protracted bankruptcy case but previous talks between the state and 
the utility were fruitless so was a sevenhour session involving 
all parties called by gov john sununu on dec 17 
public service says it seeks a reorganization plan that is fair 
to all parties state officials fear that the utility is trying to 
satisfy its creditors demands at the expense of ratepayers 
under federal regulation the utility likely would be able to 
start charging its 360000 ratepayers for its 36 percent share in 
the 57 billion seabrook nuclear power plant before it operates or 
if it is cancelled state law bars such charges 
on paper seabrook represents twothirds of public services 
assets and except for seabrook the utility is thriving the reactor 
was completed in july 1986 but its fate and therefore its value 
remains unclear potentially complicating the utilitys 
reorganization 
public service has said it believes it may be entitled to 
increases of up to 40 percent under federal regulation shareholders 
reportedly demanded 40 percent over two years the state reportedly 
offered at least 4 percent a year for five years 
four new england utilities have expressed interest in taking over 
some or all of public services assets other than seabrook 
at least one bondholders group also offered a reorganization 
plan for public service though that was before the company sought 
bankruptcy protection holders of some key thirdmortgage bonds 
proposed spinning seabrook off into a separate company

major retailers across the country went into the 
christmas season with lowered sales expectations but many emerged 
from it pleasantly surprised as consumers staged a buying burst 
it was a good christmas a little bit better than what we had 
planned said dayton hudson corp spokesman don st dennis 
wall street analysts estimated overall retail sales were up 
around 6 percent from christmas 1987 with some segments of the 
industry recording even stronger gains 
edward johnson an analyst with prescott ball amp turben estimated 
that department stores general merchandisers and discount chains 
enjoyed a 25 percent to 30 percent increase 
at the start of the season johnson estimated industrywide sales 
would rise about 5 percent to 6 percent but the strong showing 
prompted him to revise that figure to 6 percent to 7 percent 
its in the high range of what the stores have been looking 
for he said of the industrys performance 
the christmas season is crucial for retailers because they make 
about half their annual profits during the period consumer activity 
such as retail sales accounts for about twothirds of the gross 
national product the broadest measure of economic activity 
monroe h greenstein an analyst with bear stearns amp co inc 
said the general tone of business was better than last year when 
faltering sales forced retailers to slash their prices 
but this season there were fewer markdowns greenstein said 
at dayton hudsons department stores there were just three 
promotional events the industry term for markdowns that compared 
with 10 last year st dennis said 
the department stores turned in a surprisingly strong 
performance he said 
some retailers said they came through the season well even 
though business was erratic 
i dont think we expected it to be quite as seesaw as it 
was said michael wellman vice president for marketing at k mart 
corp 
wellman said k mart had a robust start right after thanksgiving 
but the retailer saw sales slacken and then pick up before surging 
in the final days of the season 
they came through again he said of lastminute shoppers 
wellman estimated k marts discount stores had a 6 percent sales 
increase what the company had hoped to achieve when the season 
began there were no runaway bestselling items but it was a 
pretty solid kind of sales performance wellman said 
another satisfied retailer was tiffany amp co the luxury jeweler 
which reported its sales were up 24 percent from nov 1 through 
christmas day the companys performance indicated highticket gifts 
sold well 
the retailers and analysts had conservative expectations going 
into the season because of a nearly 2yearold retail sales slump 
debtsaddled consumers have put many retail purchases on hold as 
they pay for services and necessities 
there were signs in recent months that sales might pick up but 
retailers were taking no chances they stocked their shelves 
carefully and didnt expect too much from the season 
retailers therefore have less merchandise to unload in the days 
after christmas 
the stock rooms are clean there wont be a lot of big 
clearance sales dayton hudsons st dennis said 
some analysts said the holiday results might mean an end to that 
the retailers long dry spell is approaching 
christmas is really setting a positive tone for 1989 said 
robert buchanan an analyst with ag edwards amp sons inc in st 
louis the consumer has been on his backside but is coming back 
underlying strength in the consumer is beginning to build 
buchanan said im looking for a respectable 1989 in terms of 
nondurable sales 
but greenstein of bear stearns was less optimistic he said 
clothing sales likely would be strong but for the retail industry 
as a whole the rates of sales gains in recent months are not 
sustainable

an american bar association study panel on 
tuesday recommended federal regulation of the insurance industry 
the 12member aba commission called for repeal of the 43yearold 
mccarranferguson act in which congress generally left insurance 
regulation to the states 
the commission in a 183page report also urged that an agency 
with subpoena powers investigate whether improper industry collusion 
manipulates insurance availability and cost 
the commission concluded that some collusion among insurers is 
permitted under federal law and said it was unable to assess 
whether improper collusion has occurred 
the commissions report will be presented to the abas 
policymaking house of delegates when it convenes in denver in 
february the aba is the nations largest organization of lawyers 
george klotzbaugh an american insurance association attorney 
termed the reports call for repeal of the mccarranferguson act 
misguided 
the report professes to support continued regulation by the 
states but the changes it recommends would dictate to the states 
how they have to regulate he said klotzbaugh added that federal 
antitrust law would become the chief regulatory tool 
trial lawyers and the insurance industry have been fighting for 
years over who is to blame for the skyrocketing costs of liability 
insurance 
in recent years numerous states have sued insurers and other 
defendants accusing them of illegally conspiring to limit the 
availability of commercial liability insurance

the israeli shekel was devalued 5 percent 
tuesday to stem a speculative buying binge of foreign currencies 
analysts said it indicated the new government will move quickly to 
deal with the foundering economy 
the bank of israel announced the devaluation after consultations 
with finance minister shimon peres peres the former foreign 
minister moved into the finance post when the new government was 
installed thursday 
the new exchange rate is 1680 shekels to the dollar compared 
with 1599 before the devaluation the central bank said 
the move prompted the stock exchange in tel aviv to close an hour 
early to allow time for adjustment said yossi nitzani the 
general director he said the market would open on schedule 
wednesday 
the devaluation was the first since a 10 percent adjustment in 
january 1987 and was less than industry and commerce leaders had 
lobbied for that led some analysts to predict further devaluations 
factory production has been declining for a year and economists 
say the main reason is that profits have been squeezed by rising 
production costs and a fixed exchange rate for earnings abroad 
israels economy is expected to grow only 1 percent this year a 
sharp drop from 52 percent growth in 1987 
most of the weakness has been blamed on an industrial slowdown 
and on the effects of the yearold palestinian uprising in the 
occupied territories 
the government apparently was forced to move tuesday because of 
soaring currency speculation sparked by rumors of an imminent 
devaluation of as much as 15 percent 
what happened this morning was extraordinary bank of israel 
chief michael bruno said on israel radio there was a real danger 
that in several days monetary reserves would drop below the 3 
billion mark 
gideon schurr spokesman for the bank of israel said purchases 
in foreign currency were particularly high tuesday but he 
refused to give exact figures 
israeli army radio said israelis purchased a record 80 million 
in us dollars and other foreign currencies before the devaluation 
was announced 
the public apparently hoped to make a profit by buying foreign 
currency at a lower shekel rate and selling after devaluation at a 
higher rate 
analysts said it was too early to tell if the devaluation will 
stem the speculation 
yacov sheinin manager of the economic models ltd forecasting 
firm in tel aviv suggested there might be another 5 percent 
devaluation early in january and a similar devaluation later in the 
month making it less profitable to go to dollars and then shift 
back to shekels because of bank service charges averaging 3 
percent on the transactions 
but sheinin said devaluation could spark inflation and might not 
help the economy unless coupled with budget cuts and an agreement to 
hold down wages 
the government is expected to show a deficit of more than 1 
billion shekels or 600 million this year largely because of 
increased defense spending to handle the palestinian uprising 
the devaluation drew criticism from the rightwing likud bloc and 
from some in peres labor party 
peres predecessor in the finance ministry moshe nissim of 
likud said he resisted pressure to devaluate because i was not 
prepared to listen to the dictate of the street 
chaim ramon a labor member of parliament termed the action a 
worthless step and said it would have been better to wait and come 
out with a general economic program 
but peres economic adviser amnon neubach said the move was 
necessary to calm the public and the markets

inc in new york

york predicted some traders would see the lower prices as buying 
opportunities 
good support should materialize with further price weakness

coffee crop due to drought damage

closed tuesday reducing the number of players in a market already 
thinned by holiday absences

instead of the previously agreedupon 12 million during the crop 
year that began oct 1 
the usda also announced sales of 2 million metric tons of wheat 
and 750000 metric tons of corn to the soviet union 
but traders had already bid prices of corn and wheat futures up 
substantially in anticipation of the new business and some sold 
contracts tuesday in reaction to the news analysts said 
weekend rainfall in the brazilian soybean belt accounted for some 
of the selling in the soybean pit said joel karlin research

purchased 250000 metric tons of us corn

for a jetliner old is not necessarily unsafe 
but a number of recent structural failures involving aging aircraft 
is prompting federal officials and the industry to reexamine the 
question when is an airplane too old to fly 
the effect of aging aircraft on safety gained widespread 
attention eight months ago when a third of the roof of a 19yearold 
aloha airlines boeing 737 tore away during flight sweeping a flight 
attendant to her death 
industry experts from boeing engineers and airline maintenance 
officials to government regulators and aviation crash investigators 
were stunned that such a large section 20 feet long along the top 
of the plane would peel away the planes safe landing was 
described as miraculous 
the issue surfaced again in the investigation of the crash of pan 
am flight 103 last week in scotland a massive structural failure on 
the vintage boeing 747 the 15th off the assembly line in l970 
has not yet been ruled out 
and on monday a 14inch hole tore open along the crown of a 
20yearold boeing 727 belonging to eastern airlines forcing the 
plane to make an emergency descent from 31000 feet and land at 
charleston wva no one was seriously injured 
the aviation industry and government regulators have acknoweldged 
for years that the airlines jet fleet is growing older and that 
added precautions are needed to monitor cracks and other problems 
that develop on these jets 
in the case of the pan am jumbo jet pan am spokesman jeffrey 
kriendler emphasized that the boeing 747 although 18 years old had 
undergone extensive modifications and strengthening as recently as 
midl987 as a result he said the airplane comes out almost brand 
new 
investigators also emphasized that they have found no evidence so 
far of a fatiguerelated structural failure related to the crash 
one possible cause continues to be a terrorist bomb 
but pan am and many other airlines indeed are flying older 
aircraft than once had been expected with fuel prices declining 
airlines have held on to older jets eastern not long ago for 
example decided to overhaul its older boeing 727s instead of 
replace them 
since l979 the average age of the aircraft fleet belonging to 
the major airlines has increased from 1028 years to 1253 years 
according to avmark inc an aircraft consulting and appraisal firm 
it is estimated that there are about 2300 jetliners in service that 
were built before l968 
ben cosgrove vice president for engineering at the boeing 
commercial airplane co emphasized in a recent interview that age 
in itself is not necessarily unsafe but he said as an aircraft gets 
older it must come under closer inspections and increased 
maintenance 
as a plane ages you should start to expect to see some more 
damage occur through fatigue and corrosion he says 
in l983 the faa and industry began a program aimed at developing 
new safeguards to keep aging jetliners airworthy under the program 
about 1000 older jets boeing 727s 737s 747s mcdonnell douglas 
dc9s and dc8s are subject to special inspections because such 
jets are more likely to develop cracks and other problems 
but critics question whether closer monitoring and more frequent 
inspections are an adequate safeguard and since the aloha incident 
in april many industry experts including boeing engineers and faa 
safety experts have agreed that inspections alone may not be 
enough 
in some cases modification of the aircraft is needed not 
just added inspection said cosgrove acknowledging that this 
view represents a change in industry thinking 
in october the faa directed the replacement of 7200 rivets on 
every older boeing 737 to guard against a repeat of the aloha 
accident a string of previous faa orders following the aloha 
incident focused only on requiring closer inspections 
the farreaching and costly october directive is seen by industry 
experts to reflect a new attitude that close inspections are not 
enough to keep older aircraft safe and that in many cases sections 
of planes must be routinely replaced even if no defect is apparent 
three weeks before the directive was issued workers at 
continental airlines during a routine repainting discovered a 
footlong crack on an aging continental boeing 737 the crack 
apparently had not been noticed before even though that aircraft 
had been among those subject to special scrutiny because of its age 
nearly three years ago jim burnett chairman of the national 
transportation safety board cautioned in congressional testimony 
that the faa may be incapable of ensuring that older aircraft are 
kept free of dangerous cracks 
that is said to still be his view as the ntsb begins an 
investigation of mondays incident involving the eastern flight and 
as it nears conclusion of a nearly yearlong investigation of the 
aloha accident

zenith electronics corp announced modest 
increases in the wholesale prices of its color televisions tuesday 
saying the higher price tags reflected a new opportunity for 
improved profitability 
the increases effective next monday will average 1 percent to 2 
percent zenith said in a statement the price action if passed 
through to consumers would raise the price of a 300 tv set by 3 
to 6 zenith spokesman john i taylor said 
zenith said it also was raising prices on its video cassette 
recorders 
manufacturers ordinarily raise prices with apologies to 
consumers citing external factors that have forced them to charge 
more 
but officials of zenith the last major us television maker 
hope an industrywide round of price increases will bring to an end 
the pricecutting and financial losses the company has suffered in 
its battle against lowpriced imports 
for the first time in many years there appear to be real 
opportunities for price increases to stick gerald m mccarthy 
president of the zenith sales co division said in a statement 
most major manufacturers now acknowledge what weve been saying 
for years that the price erosion that has continually plagued our 
industry must stop mccarthy said 
he said other television manufacturers also have announced 
increases and predicted further price rises during 1989 but 
mccarthy said zeniths jan 1 markups were realistic in terms of 
conditioning the wholesale and retail environment to upward price 
movement 
mccarthy said worldwide picturetube shortages and the dollars 
decline against the korean won making koreanmade tvs more 
expensive here suggested that tv prices would not continue to 
decline 
glenviewbased zenith which also makes personal computers has 
not reported an annual profit since 1984 due to multimilliondollar 
losses in its consumer electronics division 
its been a period of profitless prosperity taylor said 
over the years as the industry has continued to grow and thrive 
in terms of record shipments of unit television sets and 
advancements in technology prices in the marketplace have continued 
to decline making it difficult for not only zenith but others to 
make a profit in this business 
in october at the same time it was waging an ultimately 
successful battle against a takeoverminded shareholder group 
zenith said internal costcutting had enabled it to reduce its tv 
prices to competitive levels 
zenith chairman jerry pearlman said last week the company planned 
to ask the government to monitor imports of televisions from 
countries suspected of dumping the sets in the united states at 
unfairly low prices

sunshine mining co will buy rexene corp a 
plastics and petrochemical maker for 8652 million officials for 
the companies said tuesday 
officials for the dallasbased firms said they plan to sign a 
letter of intent for sunshine known primarily for silver mining and 
natural gas production to pay 28 for each of rexenes 309 million 
shares of common stock in cash and securities 
the deal is subject to shareholder approval 
rexene through its subsidiary rexene products co makes 
thermoplastic resins and petrochemical products its products are 
used in many household goods including food packaging toys 
plastic lining used in diapers and styrene used in disposable cups 
and other containers 
we decided about nine months ago that strategically we needed 
to put a third leg on the stool needed to get into a third line of 
business said g michael boswell sunshines chairman and chief 
executive officer 
sunshine officials said the match is a natural for both 
companies joe denahan executive vice president and chief financial 
officer for sunshine said that when oil and gas prices are low so 
are the prices for the raw materials used by rexene 
sunshine lost more than 11 million during the quarter ending 
sept 30 while rexene made more than 35 million 
trading in rexenes stock was halted early tuesday pending the 
announcement and resumed later in the morning 
rexenes stock fell 250 to 22 a share on the new york stock 
exchange 
last week rexene announced that an unidentified public company 
was interested in buying all outstanding shares the company which 
went public in july was the biggest gainer on the new york stock 
exchange last week rising 50 percent 
part of sunshines strategy has been to acquire a third line of 
business related to natural resources but not to oil and gas and 
precious metals boswell said 
sunshines acquisition of rexene fits this criteria as the 
bulk of rexenes raw materials are derivatives of natural gas 
liquids he said 
boswell said sunshine plans no layoffs and will run the new 
business using the current management 
rexenes primary production plants are both in texas in odessa 
and near houston 
we hope to reach a definitive agreement quickly and look 
forward to working with sunshine said rexenes chairman and chief 
executive officer andrew j smith

the harrowing forced landing of an eastern airlines 
jetliner came as the financially pressed carrier was struggling to 
keep safety questions behind it while dealing with a tense labor 
situation 
we know that eastern airlines is safe we hope that 
professionalism will prevail eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak 
said tuesday 
the moneylosing airline whose executives have expressed concern 
about the financial impact of public perceptions of its labor 
relations could face new safety questions after mondays emergency 
landing of an atlantabound boeing 727 in charleston wva a 
14inch hole tore open in its fuselage depressurizing the cabin 
the same plane had made seven earlier unscheduled landings in the 
last five years said federal aviation administration officials 
although they indicated that such a record wasnt unusual for a 
commercial jetliner 
mechanics at eastern spent tuesday inspecting 17 of the 100 
series 727s and 28 of the 200 series 727s ceremsak said 
were doing it on our own she said its just as a 
precautionary measure following yesterdays incident 
on sunday an eastern a300 bound for newark nj had to return 
to miami international airport because of an engine problem and on 
tuesday a fort lauderdalebound a300 turned back to new yorks 
laguardia airport after a problem with a door prevented the plane 
from being properly pressurized 
eastern officials insist their safety record is one of the 
industrys best and blame scrutiny of it on publicity ploys by 
labor the airlines unions complained this year that eastern 
employees were being pressured to bypass safety procedures 
less than a month ago a managementlabor agreement negotiated in 
july by former labor secretary william brock was undercut as 
easterns pilots and machinists unions curtailed their participation 
brock was enlisted by us transportation secretary jim burnley 
to mediate after an unprecedented twopronged investigation of 
easterns safety and its texas air corp ownerships ability to run 
the miamibased carrier 
those probes which included faa inspection of every eastern 
plane reported the airline was safe but expressed concern over 
labormanagement strife the report said could have an adverse 
impact on the public safety the brock agreement called for a 
master safety committee regular meetings and other measures aimed 
at keeping labor disputes from affecting safety 
the unions had withdrawn from that ms ceremsak said 
were still committed to that program because we believe its an 
ideal forum to separate labor issues from safety we felt the 
suspension of their participation was motivated not by safety 
concerns but by other side issues 
ron cole a spokesman for eastern pilots in the air line pilots 
association said communication continues with management on safety 
concerns but alpa chose to pull out of the brock accord and seek 
redress of our grievances elsewhere 
on dec 7 the pilots union asked burnley to reopen the 
transportation department investigation into easterns management 
but burnley rejected that request in a sharply worded response that 
said eastern has demonstrated the ability to operate safely and 
there was no reason to probe it again 
the only cause for concern with respect to safety issues has 
been created by the irresponsible conduct of alpa and the iam 
international association of machinists in withdrawing from the 
safety committee process burnley added 
cole said tuesday the pilots national leadership has since 
written again to burnley 
i think any time management engages in open warfare with its 
employees there is the potential for an unsafe airline cole 
said he said eastern management followed the brock agreement by 
cutting some 12 percent of its flights and nearly 4000 jobs then 
selling its northeast shuttle service to new york developer donald 
trump 
we feel those moves were designed to put pressure on the labor 
groups cole said 
brock was out of town tuesday he has written to the eastern 
unions urging them to rejoin the safety committees 
eastern machinists president charles e bryan was unavailable for 
comment he was preparing for intense federal mediation beginning 
next week in his unions yearold contract stalemate 
eastern officials say the high costs of labor and the public 
perception of eastern as beset by labor problems are worsening its 
financial condition eastern reported 2337 million in losses for 
the first three quarters of this year and has lost 13 billion in 
the past decade

the pennwalt corp board of directors has 
rejected centaur partners buyout proposal of 100 a share calling 
the figure completely unacceptable 
the buyout offer by centaur whose principals are new york 
financiers abbey j butler and melvyn j estrin is worth about 765 
million centaur already owns 127 percent of the chemical companys 
outstanding shares 
pennwalt stock closed even at 104 tuesday on the new york stock 
exchange 
in a statement released tuesday pennwalt listed several factors 
for the boards decision including the success of pennwalts 
restructuring program and its future prospects the board also 
considered the large number of significant uncertainties in the 
centaur offer the statement said 
in addition the board said centaurs business philosophy is 
incompatible with pennwalts viewpoint 
the statement did not go into detail but did include portions of 
a letter to shareholders from edwin e tuttle pennwalts chairman 
and chief executive officer 
in the letter tuttle called centaurs offer illusory saying 
the offer is not intended to succeed 
tuttle who is also pennwalts chief executive officer said 
centaur only wants to realize a shortterm profit 
tuttle urged pennwalts shareholders to reject centaurs offer 
saying the shareholders deserve to reap the benefits of the 
companys restructuring program 
pennwalt announced that it will file the boards recommendation 
with the securities and exchange commission centaur filed its 
official tender offer with the commission on dec 13 
in the offer centaur said it might sell the companys 
agrichemical operations if their takeover succeeds centaur also 
said it would try to reduce overhead expenses which could mean 
layoffs pennwalt currently has 9000 employees and annual sales of 
more than 1 billion 
six months ago centaur announced it had bought a large stake in 
pennwalt and in october said it had acquired 1 million shares or 
86 percent of the company 
pennwalt has responded by selling its drug and equipment business 
and buying back about 40 percent of the outstanding shares
